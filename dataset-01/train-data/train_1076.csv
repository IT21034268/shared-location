2,Am i doing something wrong?,"I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck?"
5,Out of Cabrini,"A brilliant page turner, and a rare window into one of the largest, toughest, police forces on the planet. Case gives us a view that it true and gritty and will put you on the edge of your seat.It's a great book. You wont be able to stop reading the last 50 pages. He combines an image of the city as objective beast hung with winter weather and bad guys so real you need a heating blanket and loaded pistol by your bed when you read this book. It is obvious that this is is a self written book taken from his experiences on the meanest streets of Chicago. If you want a genuine look behind the badge, buy this book! I want more like this from Mr. Case, many more!"
2,"Oooohhhh, my ears are sore!","What a disappointment! I first saw Sarah Brightman in April, 1988 when she starred as Christine Daae in Phantom of the Opera. Her voice was both shrill and weak then, and nothing else has changed. She butchered Ave Maria and Nessun Dorma was a disaster. I used to think she was better off with musical theatre numbers, but if you listen to her English reindition of ""Memory,"" you'll blow your ear drums.It's quite a shame her voice is shrill because the music orchistrations are fantastic as is the backing vocals. That is the ONLY saving grace of Sarah Brightman."
4,"Modernized well-done recordings, mared by naked artist","This album includes many new recordings of old classics, done often with synthesizers and other modern music styling, such as rock drums. Not all the songs are altered, but the Ave Maria and various others are. From someone who purchased the album not aware of this, it might be of some significance to potential buyers.While the album is well recorded and produced, and while Sarah Brightman is undeniably a wonderful singer, displaying her talent very well on this album, the casual customer might be a bit surprised to see a classical artist have a centerfold in the album suitable for Playboy. Some classical artists may think that having ""sexy"" pictures on their albums might attract a wider audience, but finding a naked Brightman where the album's credits should have been was probably not the most appropriate thing."
5,Classic,it's ok this classic disck ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok oktahs all that I want to say. Good music for me
4,"Good job, Sarah",I love her voice and love these classics. What's more to say? This is worth buying if you enjoy less formalized opera.
1,What a fraud!,"I cannot believe that Sarah Brightman lets loose with some of the sounds she makes and gets away with calling them singing. As stated in another review I read on Amazon, she sings in a little girl soprano. The tone is totally unsupported and this becomes obvious when she is forced to overcompensate for her lack of vocal ability by scooping to notes and singing through an unbelievable wobble. If you want Nessun Dorma...listen to Pavarotti. If you want Rusalka's Song to the Moon...listen to the divine Renee Fleming."
3,Why waste the money?,"It's not worth the money to go and spend a whole lot of money on something you already have half of anyway. I thought this cd would be a lot more special than it really is. To me, it is only a collector's piece. But what good is it going to do? How will it change my life now that it;s here in my house? Will it put food on my table? What will I gain because I have it? I have learned now, that some things are better left alone, than bought at first site or hear-about.I already saw Sarah perform her Winter Light video on the PBS special for the Very Best of Sarah Brightman Classics. After a while, those songs on the 2nd cd will die out, and I will tire of seeing them over and over. I already hardly play Classics to begin with.Like always, I will wait til there is a totally new, fresh from the start item by Sarah. I am a big Sarah fan, but things would have been better if I spent my money on two cheaper cds for the same price."
4,Five Star Music/Minus Five Star Cover,"I just received the CD. The music is most enjoyable, as usual. However, I'm not quite sure what Ms. Brightman is trying to prove with the distasteful, cover. If I had been in a store looking to buy a Sarah Brightman CD and saw the cover, I would not have purchased it."
5,Sara Brightman CD Classic,Superb performance. Great selection. Incredible voice.Can suite easy listening as well as classic lovers.
5,Fantastic CD!,This CD deserves 5 stars! Every song is absolutely beautiful. Buy it! You will love it!
4,to many brakes and skips,"The music and voice of sara are as great as ever. the disc I recieved has at least 20 gaps, pauses and repeats on it. This really hurts the value of the recordeing and listining pleasure to the cd."
2,Sales Technique...,"A three-star recording, a zero-star sales technique. The singing on this CD is a bit airy and thin (not enough color, and some sliding through notes, which seems to indicate vocal fatigue) but overall, enjoyable. However, I do NOT appreciate the photography on the CD and the attempt to imitate some type of playboy centerfold in the booklet. I had hoped to find some INFORMATION inside the booklet, not bawdy, sexual photography. I urge people to consider whether they want to support such a distasteful sales technique by buying this CD."
2,Is There a Manager in the House?,"Brightman needs a firm hand while she decides between Beverly Sills classicism and Dolly Parton. The mix with mechanical thumpa thumpa is too trivial an accompaniment for so lilting a program. Most pathetic is the semi-nude shots, which add nothing to the album. Grow up, Sarah. You don't need tinsel to sell that magnificent voice. And hire a no-nonsense voice coach who will rid you of little-girl cuteness."
2,"For Crying Out Loud!!-Put Some Clothes on, Sarah!!!!!","I have read other comments on this CD and after seeing the inside jacket and back picture of this CD forget it!! I have bought Eden, Time to Say Goodbye and the Andrew Lloyd Webber collection but I will definitely skip this one. I love Sarah's voice but does she have to go the cheap route with her CD jackets?! I saw the video to Ave Maria and Winter Light off this album and they both feature her topless, covering herself in the appropriate places but I still wouldn't call that a bikini bottom. How can she sing Ave Maria half naked? Disgrace!!! Well I guess she figures she lost some weight so she'll start shedding the clothes-NO THANKS SARAH PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AND SING WITH SOME DIGNITY!!! Why do need to cheapen yourself to become the Brittany Spears of the genre?"
1,Recycling of materials,"Sarah Brightman sings in the same old style again and again. I'm already bored by such an unchanging vocal style. Her singing suggests purity, but actually it's bereft of emotions and imagination. I hope she can think of doing something better next time than recycling materials."
2,Not the best album,"Sarah Brightman's talent is unremarkable as is this album. She manages to make every song sound like (yet) another rendition of an Andrew Lloyd Weber number and her voice, at times, sounds like she is the long lost sister of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. In short, save your money."
3,"Good voice, nice recording, nothing amazing","Maybe is because I am spoiled by listening to Kiri Te Kanawa,but I find that Sarah's voice is not fully developed, and that she lacks passion, she does have a beautiful voice thought. Her pronunciation is hard to catch (in any language). The selection is excellent. My reccomendation is buy it, good gift too, but keep in mind that she is not the greatest."
4,It has good points,"This CD is definitely very good and Sarah Brightman's voice is still amazing, but there are two bad things.I realize that this is an album of new recordings of songs she's sung or old recordings of songs she's sung, but i think she needs to start branching out and doing more songs which arent classical or opera.Also, the pictures are a bit too revealing. I'm fine with that because there isnt any nudity, but my parents were going through my stuff and looked at them, then questioned me as to what i was actually listening to. I guess that some people still have stereotypes that that stuff isnt appropriate. Besides, its more about music than pictures, so they shouldnt think that thats going to sell CD's. I admire her courage though, I could never pose in front of cameras wearing that litle!All the tracks are very good though and its definitely worth buying!!!"
3,Agree to Disagree,"Sorry, folks. I was a bit disappointed by this album. I enjoyed Sarah's recordings of Andrew Lloyd Webber tunes and with Andrea Boccelli, but I feel opera is a bit out of her range. The engineering/production of this album, I believe, is part of the problem. They've layered her voice behind so many effects that it gets lost. Her voice just does not have the ""guts"" behind it that these songs require. I love the material though. (...)"
1,atrocious rubbish,"you might as well ask Kylie Minougue to sing this. Truly awfull and strictly for the blue-rinse brigade. Soppy tones and soft-focus orchestration, not worthy of department store elevators."
4,This CD seems rushed.,"With the lack of new material, this CD seems rushed. If you have not bought any of Sarah's CD before, start with DIVE and work your way forward. Or at least purchase La Luna and Classic's at the same time. Sarah does have a great body now (see insert photos)."
4,Some re-recordings are great...others not so,"I love Sarah Brightman and could listen to her sing the telephone book. Some of the recordings she ""re-did"" for the album are better than the originals. Among those, I count ""Ave Maria,"" the arrangement of which is beautiful and ethereal, matching our Ms. Brightman's appearance on the liner photos. However, I much prefer the original recordings of ""Pie Jesu"" and ""Time To Say Goodbye"" (this time it's a solo recording...like pumpkin pie w/cool whip, once you've had it with, without is not the same). I don't think she did these justice by altering them for this CD. Overall, the CD is worth buying and certainly not disappointing."
5,Extremely enjoyable,"I got the CD as a Christmas gift and have enjoyed its relaxed, peaceful style. Ms. Brightman has a beautiful voice and I would highly recommend the CD. I am shocked, however, at the tasteless cover and, even worse, inside the booklet, there is nothing about the selections, just more tawdry pictures of Ms. Brightman. It gives one an impression of cheapness, which I certainly hope is not the effect Ms. Brightman is going for. Cover up!"
1,Gruesome. Brightman tries classical -- and fails utterly.,"Sarah Brightman has a nice voice ... but she is far from good enough for anything more demanding than soft background music. On this album, she tries her hand at a number of well-known classic and classical pieces (first among them Schubert's ""Ave Maria"").The resulting auditory catastrophe -- her voice fails to carry in the general sense and is hard-pressed just to maintain the proper note -- has been attempted to be whitewashed by the producer by adding in a disgraceful arrangement, likely produced on the cheapest of Casio electronic synthesisers.If you love music: Stay away, or you will be disappointed.If you love Brightman's voice: Stay away, or your illusions will shatter.Felix Kasza."
3,You can sleep to this,"Unfortunately, I am going to be writing something a little negative here. I do not hate Brightman as much as I cannot listen to her - especially, when I know there is better out there. Actually, I have been forced to listen to her more then I want to because of my daughter - this is her favorite bedtime music. Brightman really breaks my heart to hear her singing O' Mio Babbino Caro like that. She really glosses over the words and does a great job at botching up the emotions expressed in this song. One of my favorite songs too. And her voice is too weak and thin to be any good example of how Opera should sound. However, if it weren't for the 4th song - Anytime Anywhere - I would recommend this to anyone who wants something light and peaceful to sleep to."
2,Black ants don't even get close to it,"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection)."
4,Before There Was Youtube,"These guys watch and collect tens of thousands of hours of old VHS tapes to bring you the funniest and most bizarre collection of home movies, instructional programs, public access, infomercials, video dating, broadcast TV and outtakes from the 80's and early 90's. They boil it down to an hour and 1/2 of hilarious 1 to 5min clips minute clips of the best stuff. It's really funny, basically the funniest Youtube clips, before there was Youtube. As much as I love and appreciate effort and accomplishment of collecting, watching and selecting these clips the only draw back for me is the added commentary and the fact that the show is presented to a live audience for the Dvd's I would prefer just watching the clips without commentary, skits and audience reaction, but it's brilliant and hilarious all the same, highly recommended."
2,Kaboom..... what a dud,"I love Kaboom products, but this product doesn't work. It says fill one cap and pour in toilet. I have small toilets and it took a cap and 1/2. Then it still didn't go to the rim (whole point of the product). It was only good for 3 cleans... awfully expensive stuff to only clean the potty 3 times.I say use the good ole spray and brush it takes just as long to do that as it does to pour this nonsense into you toilet and wait for it to not work."
1,This Product DOES NOT work.,"I have used it exactly as directed on the label. I have even left it in the bowl for 4 hours and it does absolutely nothing. I clean on a regular basis so there isn't much to clean. The fumes are overwhelming, so be careful!!"
3,a dose of his own medicine,"When hotshot emergency room doctor Greg Brulotte is terribly injured in a skiing accident, he gets an up-close look at life in the hospital from a patient's point of view--and doesn't enjoy it (Frustrated nurses eventually hand him the Worst Patient of the Century award.). But while Greg's being forced to reevaluate his life, he's also falling for Lily Sullivan, the emergency room nurse whose hesitant interest in him gradually transforms into a love that has the potential to last long after his hospital stay is over.While I hardly consider this story top-notch entertainment, I was taken by the relationship between Lily's brother Kaleb and her friend Frannie, a gutsy social worker. Hutchinson is also to be commended for her sensitive portrayal of Lily and Kaleb's love for their grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. And for anybody who's been through an extended hospital stay, there's a fiendish sort of delight in seeing the doctor as a patient . . ."
4,Nikon Travellite binocs,"First of all, these binocs are very lightweight (but don't feel like a toy) and fold to jacket pocket size, a real plus. Optics also seem to be what I would expect from Nikon. Overall very satisfied for the price. Will probably also buy the higher mag version for home use. Great glasses to take along on a hike for birding etc., esp. if you are also carrying camera gear and don't want to be weighted down."
3,Pretty good compacts,"I bought these to give as a holiday gift. I've only looked through them a few times, but they seem pretty good for view and eye relief with glasses. The downside I see is a ghost ring reflection around the perimeter of the view. It looks like a problem in the optical engineering."
4,Good Entry Level,"Purchased for a relative and within a budget limit. for the price, the Nikon's are a good value but clearly not for a more serious user. As a birder, I have a Nikon Monarch- considerably more money and size but the best optics for the money."
4,Small but good,"We wanted a small binoculars for occasional use. Nikon pretty much does what it says - compact, good quality. Had it only 2 weeks, so I don't know how it will hold up, but seems well built"
3,quaility probuct..,"I am a bird watcher and these glasses really give you a good view of the birds clear, bright, and nice magnification.."
1,Didn't Receive it,"I got the package and receipt in the mail, but there was not product. The spray had been taken out of the back. So I guess I can't give an accurate rating."
3,Funny Gag Gift,"Very funny gift. It got here on time, which is great. The only downside was that the badge ot comes with is just a piece of cardboard. Otherwise, great gift."
1,"don't purchase, waste of money!","I was super excited to finally cleaning out my shower drain. I followed the directions on the box, and bubbles started appearing... BUT nothing happened. the drain is just as blocked as it was before this product. save yourself money and look for other products."
1,Complete waste of time for the whole can,"I had a clogged drain in my children's bathroom. I tried and tried and nothing happened. If anything, it was more clogged than when I started"
1,Didn't work for me!,Save your money call the plumber or do it yourself. Plunger worked just as well as this did.
1,very sloppy product,This product did not work on my toilet. I think CLR Power Plumber is a very sloppy product. Do not waste your money on this.
1,did Not work for me!,"First, let me say I shop on Amazon all the time...Love it! but this once I have to say I was not happy with the product. I kept trying, going back to the directions over and over till I had emptied the can with no results!!!!"
3,Worthless,Basically this just compressed air that likes the firepower to have any real benefit...I tried to use it to cure a slow flow toilet to no avail...don't waste your money
4,"Works Great, But Beware the Aftereffects","So, ever since doing some cooking on Thanksgiving day, my kitchen sink has been pretty blocked up. I don't like pouring toxic chemicals in the sink, so when I came across Power Plumber, it sounded like a great idea.I am writing this immediately after having used it. Oh wow.My sink is now draining perfectly. However, you might be able to guess: what happens when you shoot pressurized air into a blocked sink?You get an explosion.I got wet, the area around my sink got wet, the living room area behind the sink got a little wet, and basically just wow.So, in conclusion:* Works great. Your sink will drain exactly like a sink ought to.* You might get wet in the aftershock."
3,Works Like a Plunger on Roids,"This basically is a POWER plunger...it will attempt to dislodge any clog you have and send it further down the pipe. While this might be ok for TP and waste, a hair clog just moves to a new bend in the pipe and gets stuck there. The force is so powerful it blew my pipe right off the tub--so I ended up having to call a plumber anyway.I can see the benefit on this product for monthly maintenance, but not on specific, stubborn clogs."
5,"High-powered, low cost plumber","I've used this stuff for years, but my local Target store stopped selling it abruptly. I'm glad I could find it here on Amazon. It's powerful on clogged/slow drains, but gentle on pipes- and way cheaper than snaking a drain!"
5,Amazing!,Have a slow drain in stall shower. Used liquid plumber for years followed by getting plumber to snake line every so often. The drain was getting so slow that I left plunger in the shower and would plunge routinely to prevent lots of standing water. Purchased this thing and it worked like a charm. Can't believe my plumber didn't use this thing... the best invention!
4,Love Come Down,"She rocked out in the 80s with ""Love Come Down"" that is one of my favorite 80s songs! I love that song!"
5,Incredible!!!,"She was...is.... SIMPLY SPECTACULAR. I think she was 16 when she started. Today people would say she sounds ""old"", but that means less than nothing. She sounds like a woman- not a like little girl, which most female singers today try to sound like, for reasons I cannot understand. The mega hit ""Shame"" ripped dance floors to shreds when it came out and still makes me feel the spirit today. If you like Ms. ""Champagne"" and Cheryl Lynn RULED back in the day- and nothing they have done sounds dated if you hear it now."
3,This was bought second hand,"and that is all that it was worth. There are some good tracks, but the album is not good all the way through. This is not one of the albums that I personally have come back to to listen to over and over again (either to see what new things can be found or just for the listening enjoyment).If you can find this online for about $2 (plus shipping), then that is about what it is worth.All of her better songs you are likely to find on good R&B; compilations-- and if you already have most of this, then the songs that you find here (that you won't find on those) don't justify the purchase of this."
1,sample,"the sample i wanted to hear, was ""love come down"". and it's not on the sample list. i ordered it anyway."
2,Wedding Crashers,"Very predictable, The plot was so so only thing keeping my attention were the boobys being flashed aroundThought it could have been alot funnier very dull.this one will definately be traded in."
3,Interesting concept...and that's about all,"First of all, I think the idea of picking up women at weddings and funerals quite clever. Anyone whoever been to a wedding knows all the single women are in full fairy tale mode and are ripe for the picking. It's probably the only place a janitor could get some serious play. So the first part of the film I found very funny. But then the rest of the story with Owen's character falling in love and the girl's jerk of a fiance all too cliche and predictable. I was actually bored--except when the brother nearly rapes Vaughn's character. That's an accomplishement to make a near rape funny...but the rest ho hum. Is it over yet?"
3,OK,"This is a bit of formula picture, kind of predictable, but the characters are fairly funny and the movie supplies its intermittent laughs. No real moral message, but ""laughs.""The acting is above average. It will be interesting what kind of roles these two lead actors get in the future...probably nothing of substance, stuck in the realm of Eddie Murphy type films.Teenagers will probably find this film hilarious."
2,"Love the movie, hate the dvd.","I just purchased Wedding Crashers and I'm severely disappointed in how the Uncorked version was layed out. They give you the option to watch the theatrical version or the uncorked version. Neither of those choices have the deleted scenes added in for your viewing pleasure. You can only see the deleted scenes in the special features section. Not only that, but the uncorked option that is supposed to be ""longer, wilder and funnier"" is actually shorter and less funny because they removed one of the best parts of the movie.You can't just sit down and watch the movie with every scene included and that's a big negative for me."
1,Not that good!,This movie was not funny at all. There were no funny parts I turned it off after a few minutes. After all the good reviews this movie got I had high hopes for this movie but I was very disapointed. Don't waste your time on this movie. Hope this helps someone.
2,this is good?,"I love owen wilson and vince vaugan, yet i thought this movie was boring. I don't kevin neeland, but his few appearances really were the highlight of this movie."
1,Rape is comedy?,"A woman is tied down to a bed and raped by a man, screaming the entire time. She then falls in love with and marries her rapist. The end.Switch the sexes, and then you get a synopsis of this movie. How can rape of any sort be considered funny?The fact that more people are not outraged by this movie frightens me and makes me worry about the world I live in."
2,Stupid.,"Went with friends in search of a raunchy, stupid buddy flick. What we got was a movie, so raunchy and stupid, it lacked heart and comedy.And why in the hell is Republican Senator John McCain in this movie?Anyways, it was a complete disappointment and I regret paying to see it."
3,Entertaining and funny,"Overall fun to watch. I think my expectations were too high and was waiting for it to really get side splittingly funny - but it never really took off in that direction. Great light hearted, no thinking involved movie to watch."
3,Wedding Crashers Uncorked,"Not the greatest DVD. The extra scenes don't really add much to the movie, and the extra features are weak.The movie is still funny and I've found it rewatchable to a certain extent. (I can only watch a very select few movies over and over.)So if you loved the movie, get the dvd. If you're hoping for lots of extra Vince and Owen, think twice."
5,Great movie,"As described and in good packaging. Was a present for my sister, didn't come in time for Christmas, but I guess I read the dates wrong. Great movie!"
2,The idea was fun but . . .,"The ending was . . . So far fetched you couldn't help but sit there and say no. In a movie like this, you can't go THAT far fetched. Other than that, the first half was enjoyable and a nice reminder to people to be honest about yourself."
2,Don't crash this Wedding!,"Vince Vaughn (Psycho) and Owen Wilson (Bottle Rocket) team up in the comedy Wedding Crashers which also stars Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter), and Rachel McAdams (Red Eye).The movie is not all that funny. In fact, I only giggled a few times at some of the jokes and one-liners, and laughed to myself at how bad and cliched the rest of the movie was.Vaughn and Wilson have got to be two of the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated actors working in movies today. Crashers portrays them both as players who crash weddings to pick up girls. Their game turns on them when they crash the wedding of the Secretary of Treasury's, played by Walken, daughter. They both hit on two other daughters of the Secretary and find themselves falling in love.As you can see, I didn't go into details nor did I use concise plot points to discuss Wedding Crashers because I find it all a waste of my good time.Wedding Crashers is one of the worst films of 2005.Not recommendedD"
2,"Don't believe the hype...worth renting, but don't buy!","I just finished watching the DVD about 10 minutes ago. It's story line can only be compared by taking ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""Road Trip"" and smushing them together in a very twisted, and overly-thought out kind of way. It had it's funny moments; I'll admit, I chuckeled once or twice...but it's still not worth buying it (at least until you see it at the 4 for $10 bin in Walmart)."
1,Movie funny- quality of extremely poor,The movie is funny. This review is about the quality of the product. I rented this video on Amazon. The image was poor and while still visible had distortion effects and pixelation in parts. Looked out of focus most the time.Oh about the movie...not much different than original...just more shots of boobs.
3,"Shallow, but not as bad as I expected","On the plus side, this is the first time I've found Owen Wilson compelling. Though not given much to work with in terms of actual comedy, his comic timing was spot-on. Vince Vaughn did everything he needed to do as well.However, the film had a flimsy premise, and was essentially one big cliche after another.2.5, rounded up to 3."
5,Very Entertaining Movie,"In an era flooded by PG13 movies it's great to see a funny, well rounded movie for geared for adults. The casting for the all of the characters was amazing, as was the storyline, and resulted in a really, really funny movie. Seriously. I plan on seeing it again....and buying the dvd."
5,The return of comedy.,"Don't think twice. Just buy this DVD.This film marks the beginning of what we can only hope is a resurfacing of quality in comedy, and film itself. I think there was actually a serious nationwide theatrical janitorial issue with all of the houses that were showing 'Crashers' this summer. The flocking crowds of fans kept peeing their pants while watching the film, and it was nearly impossible to keep the upholstery clean. Janitors were striking. Unions were outraged. It would be cool if the DVD had a commentary with the Director and the writers. I looked on IMDB, and apparently, the writers Faber/Fisher are working on a new film for next year called ""We're the Millers"" about a guy who is trying to get out of the pot-dealing game. Can't wait."
5,Perfect Item,"Great condition (well, since it was new) and great shipping. Decent price as well. But you can't put a price on the greatest movie in the world!"
1,pointless,"Absolutely most pointless thing amazon has ever done to make money. Audio and picture doesn't match, complete waste of time and money."
2,Dissappointed,"I bought a 'new' DVD and got a 'used' one instead. It had fingerprints and minor scratches all over it. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift too! The seller should have sold it as used, NOT new."
1,Don't waste your time,"I foolishly thought that maybe this would be a funny movie considering the hype around it screaming so. But no it is at best something for people who consider really generic comedy. It tries to pull itself together by bundling up stereotypical characters like the ""homo"" artist or the sex pot twenty-something and of course the eccentric grandmother. The basis of the two lead characters crassing weddings is just mindnumbing. I am really trying to fathom why anyone would think that this formulaic really annoying comedy would find this funny. It is at best fratboy humor."
1,Not even a One.....,"There should be a space for a zero because thats what this movie should get. This movie depicts woman as sex objects who are so stupid and shallow to just jump in bed with some guy they meet at a wedding. This movie depicts 2 horny guys who only have one thing on their mind---sex. How degrading and absolutely objectionable with all the diesases and chance of pregnancy !!!! I found nothing in this movie funny, the fact that these 2 horny sickos meet the ""girl of their dreams"" one day and are in love the next is just plain ludicrious. The scenes with their other friend should have been cut, that was just plain unnecessary. What a waste of time and money !! I cannot tell you how much I despised this thing they called a ""movie""."
5,Brilliant delivery,This movie is classic... Vince Vaughn reminds me of a guy I used to date... just hysterical. You can put this in at any time and enjoy a good laugh.
2,It wasn't good at all,"This movie dissapointed me the most this year. It was a little funny, but all in all, a terralble storyline. Don't see it."
4,Really is a great movie.,"The title tells the story. Wedding Crashers; Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are wedding crashers who ... crash weddings to have sex with girls. Eventually, they both meet girls at a wedding and end up going to a family cottage. ( A huge one. ) Anyways, the story is somewhat slow and boring at times, but basically this is a laugh fest. Will Ferrell comes in near the end of the movie and every line he says is funny as hell. There is no reason why this movie should get less than 4 stars, it is hilarious.Note: I have the unrated version and it is no different the the theatrical version... I don't get it."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!,This was the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life. If you are a vince vaughn fan or an owen wilson fan u will bust your side laughing at this movie. It belongs at the top of any movie lovers favorite list.
4,NEAR PERFECTION!,"A great comedy, Wedding Crashers, as the title indicates, brings to the screen the story of two buddies that make a habit out of going to weddings uninvited in search of food, drink, and women. Things become a bit more complicated when one member of the dynamic duo falls in love...Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!Strongly recommended for an evening's entertainment."
5,best comedy in a long time,"My expectations of this film were very high, considering that I'm a huge fan of Vince Vaughn. I have to say, I was not disappointed in the least! This movie was not only hilarious through and through, but it also had a really sweet love story tied in. Vince was the motormouth he always is, Owen was sweet and had his funny moments such as in his phone message when he says ""This is John. ::sigh:: whatever..."", Rachel was dainty and sweet, and Isla was just hilarious and insane. I believe that this was the first film that Vince really worked to his potential. He was really able to go crazy and make the audience roar with laughter. I would see this movie over and over (I saw it 4 times in the theatres lol) and never get tired of it. WHAT A FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!! Vince does it again!!!!!! :)"
1,simply awful,"ok, I love Vince Vaughn, but even he cannot save this disaster. Poorly written, poorly acted (except for Vince, and the always charmingly menacing Christopher Walken), inconceivable plotline (what do these guy do for a living??), unconvincing ""redemption"" at the end, and poorly edited, it's just not worth the (long) time it takes to watch it.Save your money."
5,"Hillarious, Silly Movie!","This Movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The characters really fit in well. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are both hillarious. Vince plays more of the goofy, party machine guy while Owen tends to get more soft and sensitive when he meets Claire. My favorite character in this movie wil probably have to be Todd who plays the gay, evil painter. He is hillarious in the part with Vince Vaughn on the bed. The grandma also is very amusing with the few lines she has. All in all this movie is very funny and entertaining and is definately worth a buy."
5,hilarious,very funny movie with zany scenes..as u can see by the long detailed reviews left before mine..this is a HIT and id recommend it to anyone ready for laughs
2,What's funny about this?,"I watched this last night and I really wish that I hadn't. The only thing this movie has going for it is the casting. I chuckled one time during the entire film. I'm very disappointed, considering that this is supposively a comedy and one of the 'best of the year'. I would not recommend this. If you want a real comedy, turn to The 40 Year Old Virgin, American Pie: Band Camp, or my personal favorite, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. At least those made me laugh. I can appreciate a good comedy, but Wedding Crashers is not that."
3,Uncorked MY BUTT,"Wedding Crashers uncorked. Uncorked my butt! 2 additional scenes, and they decided to call this UNCORKED, it was totally OVERATED. It is not really all that different from the theatrical version.And why is Will Ferrell not in the credits. He is sooooo funny, yet they gave him like 3 scenes.. What is up with that? He would have been totally great as The Senator.The deleted scenes were crap, and were rightfully deleted. I was disappointed in this DVD, it was over-hyped, and it was NOT uncorked."
3,When the expected day at last arrives!,Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are two scoundrels who love to participate in weddings seducing all the possible women.But as always a crucial twist of fate will appear and both lives will experience a new turn.Amusing and funny entertainment in this hard to believe modern fairy tale approached from the male perspective.
3,Just Par,"The description for this item did say used, however it also said in good condition. The Disc skipped a number of times in the DVD player."
5,Wedding Crashers,"It came in good time, hoping it works for xmas - it is one of my son's fave films so thanks."
4,A good movie.,"It is a good movie to watch to pass the time, entertaining yes but not a blockbuster hole in one."
5,Guidebook for meeting women!,"This is a great, great movie!! One of the funniest ever!! However, I would not necessarily recommend following their examples. If you like comedy like American Pie, you'll love this one!"
4,I USUALLY RUN WHEN I SEE THE WORD WEDDING IN THE TITLE OF A MOVIE!,"This is a very funny movie. I can't think of many films with the word wedding in the title that I like. If you haven't seen it,you should, but stick to the regular edition. One of the better comedies to come out in a while."
2,C'mon folks - let's be honest,"It is sad to see how starved we all are for a good solid funny movie. Once again, this movie is hyped as a ""laugh riot"" - it's not. Pay attention - I guarantee that the folks who think this is ""hilarious"" are not movie watchers - I mean these are not people that really watch inde films, foreign films and the like - if you are a true movie watcher - you will be able to tell the ending in the first ten minutes. Just take the easiest path hollywood prediction on how it will end - you are right. (BTW - for all the folks that summarized the plot in their posting - that is not a review!) There were some funny lines and some funny scenes but overall it was scattered and all over the map. - So much potential, great premise, great cast, strong budget - Sad to see them just miss the mark - finally - ""Uncorked""? - pretty tame if you ask me."
3,Pretty overhyped but OK,"I usually love movies like this...but they have gone way to formulaic..wheres ben stiller??? if you get that then you can see that the shock vaule and humor is not that exceptional, but instead worth a rent.The story as a whole is pretty weak, but the draw is that ""naughty"", sexual content that even on this uncorked edtion is not enough to save it. The movie is entertaining mostly due to the characters as opposed to the situations... meaning vince is the reason we care at all.it was too hyped up."
5,Favorite Movie,"This movie is a classic modern comedy .. .definitely one of my favorites. Filled with hilarious lines and situations, Wedding Crashers will be sure to keep you laughing."
5,loved it,this movie is one of the few movies that men and women will enjoy. i love this and this movie is a must own
1,"Pure, unadulterated CRAP","Maybe it's just me, but I don't find rape very funny, even if it happens to Vince Vaughn. Up to that point I thought the movie was somewhat funny, but that scene did it for me. This movie's not worth the time it takes to open the package. Save your money!"
2,Jane Seymour-An Unusual Role!,"I bought this film only because Jane Seymour is in it. She has a minor role as a member of a wacky family and plays a part that is the closest thing to an ""r"" rated scene I have ever seen Jane play. Overall the movie was far to corny for my tastes."
4,A movie thats makes you laugh out loud!,"Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are nothing short of fantastic! Now I'm not one of those people that like everything certain actors put out, this was just laugh out loud funny! The beginning, first 20 minutes or so, I thought was good but I found myself thinking if this is all there is, it's going to be a long over done movie. But then it took off to the next level.I could not tell one single part of the movie that was not funny and worth watching."
1,Garbage,Very vulgar and degrading. It is a shame that there is a market for this junk. This will appeal to those who are flippant about sexual ethics. Catholics should find this offensive because it makes a mockery out of a Sacrament. Vince Vaughn plays a very contemptible fellow. There are much better ways to use your time and money.
4,better but not that bettherask,many of these kind of movies will makeyou laugh but for this one people wont know whats happening owen wilson and vince vaughn are funny in this movie but the movie goes to long and could hav stop 25minutes before it was over but still the evildoer in this film whithc has already seen as a movie like thesestill could nt have been better with thejokes and punch lines this is a must see for the whole family on video
2,"Quick entrance, slow ending","Overall this was a funny movie. The beginning started out great and kept going ok through the first half of the movie but the second half seemed to drag with some very predictable, hollywood style plots and acting. At the end I felt quite disappointed from the ending stretch. Good to see once but not really worth buying in my opinion."
3,hey om just wedding crashers is the movie oyah dit dit,this will be released january 3rd on dvd comes with bonus features trailers and audio surround sound this movie has a scene with him getting shot in the but or jane seymour trying to seduce owen wilson or a scene with a guy on vince vaughn bed trying to have sex with him but this isnt really a comedy its kind of a movie thats trying to be a crude comedy crude thats funny not really a comedy dickhead
2,Overrated,"I went into this with high expectations because it earned so much at the box-office but I have to remind myself, the audience for this is probably the same people who watch countless Reality shows and dumb Television comedies that insult their intelligence.You have two doofus unlikable characters here who go to Wedding to pick up chicks and have sex with them (ha haa haaa), a family that is suppose to be whacky but are just pathetic and the one gay character who is portrayed as a lunatic and unfunny dialogue! Wilson and Vaughn are capable of much better and they're slumming it here. Hell you even have Will Ferrell here who is unfunny.The only reason I gave it two stars was because of Rachel McAdams who rises about this mess.I'm all for R rated comedies like the recent 40 Year Old Virgin and old movies like Stripes but this one is lame."
3,take it for what it is,"So vince has a motor mouth. He had a big mouth in Swingers, and it made him a star. This movie is not out to make you think. This movie is made so you won't have to think. A movie you can miss 30 minutes of and still jump right in and get into. It has funny and stupid moments. Everybody knows what type of comedy they like some people like adam sandler and some don't. Some people like jim carrey and some people ( like me) don't. So you know if you are going to like this because you liked dodgeball,shangi-hi Knights, and other movies these 2 been in. So You get what you expect A SLAPSTICK comedy.ENJOY"
4,"Thank God, the true summer movie!","Finally! Hollywood gives us a R-Rated comedy with two leading men people actually enjoy to see! Sure it has it's flaws, but I laughed so hard I cried. Cried. With funny. Vaughn and Wilson are perfect together, as is the MYSTERY GUEST at the end of the movie. You'll be quoting this one after the theater."
3,A good movie with technical exceptions.,I gave it a three star instead of a four star because of a technicality.The transfer to DVD on this edition wasn't that good. In particular my main grip is the poor sound editing. Throughout the entire movie I noticed the actors mouths were not perfectly in synch with the actual voices. In some cases the mouths would move about a word to slow thus making it rather annoying and less fun. It is kinda like the old Japanese Karate movies where the sound editing is so poor that words could be heard but the mouth isn't moving. This to me is a big detail..
5,this movie was great,"this movie was hilarious.......it was the 2nd best comedy of the year, right below the forty year-old virgin, and right above waiting.......i highly recomend you buy this"
2,"Tacky, Crass and Disappointing","Three years plus after this movie came out, finally borrowed it from the local library. I remember the previews as being pretty funny and wanting to see the whole movie. What a waste of time! Two unethical sleazeballs crash weddings for free food and free sex...what's romantic about that?? They get attached to one of the world's most dysfunctional families and everyone except one daughter (played by Rached Mcadams who is lovely) acts like a total butt head. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I like Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson (not necessarily together) both of whom have been in much better/funnier movies. This is NOT a movie you will remember or want to view twice."
2,Not Amused,I tried to sit through the movie on BOOTLEG because it definitely didn't look good enough to rent. I was right. I was bored pretty much through it. I got to Vince Vaughn getting knocked down by the steroid football player and gave up. I wasn't entertained. How many weddings can you crash to make an hour and a half's worth of a movie without realizing the idea is old?
1,GARBAGE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER,"JUST FINISHED WATCHING THIS TRASH (FREE RENTAL).THIS DID NOT MAKE ME LAUGH ONCE,NOT EVEN A CHUCKLE. I CANT BELIEVE THIS WAS A BOX OFFICE HIT.AND WHATS UP WITH WILSON'S HAIR EVERY SCENE IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT OUT OF BED. AND THE BIG GOOF VAUGHN,YOU TIRE OF HIM AFTER 2.5 MINUTES.CHRIS WALKEN LOOKED LIKE THE WALKEN DEAD. HOW DO THEY GET TO BE ACTORS, ARE WE SO DUMB TO MAKE THEM SO POPULAR. SAD AND PATHETIC. ANY FOOLS THAT BOUGHT THIS DISC CAN EITHER USE THEM AS COASTERS OR TO SCOOP UP DOG OR CAT WASTE."
3,Digital Download...,"I bought this as a digital download thinking itd be a really great comedy to have to watch over and over. After watching it I'm thinking it was ok...but not really a buyer...it still had it moments, but the initial laugh value wasnt there anymore..."
2,This isn't funny at all.,"Funny, you have got to be kidding. I usually like Owen Wilson's movies, but this is frat house slepstick that died. But not soon enough. Don't waste you time on this one."
3,Funny but not hilarious,"I liked it. Not as much as I expected because of all the hoopla over how great it was. Even the librarian who checked me out fussed over it ""This movie is so funny!"". I think my sense of humor has changed as I get older. I think when I was under 30, I would have loved this flick.Grandma was a hoot. And the best scene is when Vince Vaughn gets tied up in bed and gets three separate visitors. Don't want to say too much and ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Which it seems everyone who plans on has. I think it could have been shorter because I was getting antsy during the last 20 minutes or so."
5,wow.. laughing till drop,This was a great movie if you want to have a couple of hours of non-stop laughter...great way to end a long hard week of work to get lots of laughs!! great movie for adults!!
4,"WEDDING Crashes in Spots, But Soars for Most of Movie","First of all, WEDDING CRASHERS is definitely Rated [R] for a reason. So, it's a safe bet that you should leave the kids at home. Secondly, it's very funny. It crude, rude, and hysterical. The only negative comments I have is that it should have been even funnier. There were three distinct instances in which the movie could have made more fun of its initial premise. The actual act of crashing weddings to pick up women is almost completely spent by the time the opening credits are finished. Another ""crash"" that prepares you for big laughs, never gets through the door. And the brass Christopher Walken plays the straight man for much of the movie and his talents seem wasted, as well. The movie is packed with fun, but there is so much more that could have been done. I smell a sequel in the works!"
3,Sure to please fans of this comedy team,"Not the best, not the worst wedding romantic comedy. I'm a sucker for any vehicle for the two leading men. A solid cast lifts so-so material. If you have to see everything with Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and the inimitable Christopher Walken and Will Ferrell, then rent this one."
2,"Funny, but I was expecting more","Wedding Crashers is another in the line of adolescent comedy that seems so popular nowadays. There are some funny scenes, and Will Farrell has a great cameo. However, with Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, I was expecting to be laughing out loud a lot more, and I wasn't. By the end of the film, it seems more like a shallow love story than a comedy film. Good for some laughs, but these actors have done better films."
4,Nice Quality But,"I bought this in a Womens XL as a gift, but ended up keeping it for myself, I usually wear a medium, sometimes a large and it fits me perfectly needles to say the person I purchased it for, it did not fit her. I like the jacket,alot, just not the biggest 49er fan"
3,Missing pages,The book was an excellent read until you reach page 72. The next page is 97. What to do? It's hard to continue reading a book with a big chunk of skipped pages.
4,Al-non,"For all those struggling with loved ones with the disease of alcoholism, this book is excellent."
3,A Mixed Response,"This, Roger Eno's first solo album, gets a mixed response from me. A few of the tracks, such as ""Through The Blue"" and ""The Old Dance"" stand out as some of my all-time favorites. But why do ""Voices"" and ""The Day After"" seem to sound just the same? And is it mere coincidence that ""Recalling"" and ""A Place"" use the same Left-Hand piano chord pattern? This is an Album that has to be included in the Canon of R. Eno's greatest works, but it also seems more like a vehicle for Brian Eno's ""Treatments"" than a Roger Eno solo debut."
5,"Roger Eno's ""Apollo""!","If you loved Apollo, then this is for you. It has more in common with Music for Films, but still captures the gravity and majesty that you're looking for - don't be afraid of this one."
4,Social Reformer,"This is a very readable biography of Maggie Kuhn. While lately known for her role in Gray Panthers, Maggie has dedicated her entire life to improving social conditions and empowerment of women. She says ""Speak your mind--even if your voice shakes. Well-aimed slingshots can topple giants."""
5,Benedetti al maximo,"Yoestoy de acuaro con Benedetti ciando dice que esta novela se ha sobre valorado. Es una historia simple peroesta tan bien contada que merece ser leida varias veces. No es una novela magistralpero en su sensilles radica su encanto. Es una novela linda con la que uno se siente indetificado mas de una vez. Ieal para empezr a conocer a Benedetti, porque si no se ha leido esto no se conoce todavia."
5,Extraordinary,"Just the best book I have ever read, and I have read a lot. Do not hesitate one second about buying it."
1,"Rome is eternal - (this rating is supposed to be 4 stars, not 1)","City of the Soul - I certainly have to concur with author Murray that Rome is a unique and wonderful place. This little book is a gentle pleasure to read. Not much new here, but there are some interesting factoids and it's nice to read of this man's personal attachment to a place that I also love. He's a good writer with the soul of an opera singer, which he originally wanted to become, and has a genuine talent for describing some of the very special locations that exist only in the eternal city."
3,"Good, but there are better books on the subject","William Murray's account of his life in Rome is an interesting read. Far from serious history his story is personal and gives the reader an ""insider"" view of the eternal city. I have been to Roma a couple of times and have many cherished memories of the city. Mr. Murray seems to have a strong undertone of angst toward Rome (perhaps from his unrealized dreams of opera stardom) but these far from spoil the entire book. As another reviewer commented his disdain of Catholic Rome and his affair with a married woman did seem out of place, but all in all this book was worth a read."
5,A great story of a great product.,"This was a book that I picked up and couldn't put down, even though I thought I knew the story already!Andrea Butter and David Pogue provide a deep-inside look at the development of one of the most beloved consumer ""gadgets"" ever. This fascinating and well-written tale details how a few talented enterpreneurs with a vision were able to defy convention wisdom and define the handheld revolution. It's an engaging book that I'll be reading again!"
4,Pleasant page-turner with interesting business insights,"This book represents a powerful collaboration between industry veteran Andrea Butter and well-liked technology journalist David Pogue. I really enjoyed the book's engaging, fun, yet substantive style. It doesn't shy away from describing technical issues in detail without getting overly abtruse. The only possible blemishes are: 1) as others have pointed out, the ending is a little abrupt, but then, any ongoing printed history runs that risk; and 2) the book steers clear of passing any judgments on the various controversies surrounding Palm, Handspring, and the handheld industry. It bends over backward trying not to offend anybody, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view. All in all, a good-natured, well-researched book that definitely makes you look at your PDA with more respect and curiosity."
5,guitar sound is a spangly spangly new twist,"Kurupts skills on the mic are nicely above average, the guests spots are terrific but it's the BEATS on this one that make it way, way up there above the clouds. Namely, that guitar sound - check out the steely guitar sound - only the west coast can use guitars like this- check out ""on, on sight"" and ""the hardest"". Best tracks I've heard for a long, long time."
3,"It's Aight...Can't compare to ""Streetz Iz A Mutha""","I've been a Kurupt fan since the whole Death Row days and the first two solo cd's were arguably classic west coast ish. I loved ""Streetz Iz A Mutha"" the most out of all of them though. With that cd u didn't fast forward any songs u listened to it all the way through. Space Boogie had sum decent songs but i found myself skippin a lot of tracks. If u are a hardcore Kurupt fan then this is a good cd to get but for those who never heard of Kurupt b4 u should start off with Streetz Iz A Mutha or Kuruption!"
3,Okay or not okay that is the question!!!,This cd is somewhat worth listening to. But it's kind of played out.It's just like the other albums that he puts out there. No one really knows what going to become of him. He changes his view from one cd to the next.
5,Kurupt: Space Boogie Smoke Oddessey,"Well when this cd first came out i wanted to pick it up because of how good Kurupt's last cd was, but i was still unsure about buying it because i hadn't really heard if it was good or not.Well just 2 days ago i bought this cd,and let me tell you that it is the bomb. The best songs on the cd are Space Boogie, Hate on me, The Hardest, Bring back that g, Lay it on back, and Kuruption. If you don't own this cd you are missing out, my advice is to go out and pick this up."
4,Space Boogie,"This CD is tight!! Classic west coast beats and lyrics. Kurupt and guests keep it gangsta throughout album.A must have for any rap fan.Also, buy D-12,St Lunatics,P Diddy (i hate to say it, but its good),and Tha Dogg Pound 2002.I cant wait for ""Makaveli and Dillinger : Dont Go To Sleep""!"
2,Hate on Who/ Garbage,"Yo this Cd is not nothing good or great at all. His first cd ""It's over now"" is childish. Especially with the background singing. With the confusion of wanting to be from Philly to wanting to rep the West coast, He does have the skills to make a raw fusion between the two. This Cd .... Maybe if it came in 1992-1996, it would work but not now. Grab that Foxy, ""Broken Silence"" it is a classic. One"
3,"Good to have with you, but not quite up-to-date.","We took this book on a 9-day trip to the Yucatan as a companion to the Cadogan's elaborate ""Yucatan & Mayan Mexico"". The conciseness of the Top 10 series can be very helpful when you have a limited time, and its size makes it easy to carry along.What frustrated us was the fact that we got the Dec'2008 edition in order to make sure we have the most up-to-date information, and yet - there were quite a few cases of us searching for a restaurant or a store that was highly recommended in the book, only to discover it does not exist at the specified location. A bit peculiar, considering that this edition was published less than a year ago."
5,Lots of details and helpful tips,"I really think this book is helpful to someone who is looking to travel to the Yucatan, but is not familiar with it, and needs a bit of help deciding where to go and what to do. There are sections on each major city/tourist area in the Yucatan. The books pictures are great, but not overwhelming. Each city's information includes activities and things to see. It really helps you narrow down what most interests you.There are also sections in the back of the book if you need ideas where to stay and the price range. There are great tips for travelers who have never been to Mexico before, regarding various scams, changing money, and general travel tips.Overall, I think this a great travel book. It seems pretty small, but is very well organized and is a great resource for someone looking into to travel to the Yucatan."
3,Marriage to a Loathsome Brute was Vile Enough - Now She was Accused of his Murder!,"The ton regarded Sir Benjamin Wright with utmost honor and respect. Yet Lady Emma knew her husband was, in fact, a drunken, jealous brute who delighted in humiliating her both in and out of the bedroom.His murder was a blessing - until the constable's accusing finger pointed to Emma. But it soon became apparent that her late husband hid secrets...and enemies.When the practical Comte Saint-Juste arrived on the scene offering his services, Lady Emma was about the discover what the French dedication to l'amour really meant...."
5,Another winner from thoroughbred legends,"A fine treatment of 1989 Triple Crown hopeful. This volume contains a good number of photos and is overall a classy looking book, as are all of the Thoroughbred Legends series. The text does a great job of covering the rivalry between Sunday Silence and Belmont Stakes spoiler Easy Goer."
4,Book review,Book contains a lot of useful insights into this event. The blanked out portions can be a distraction at times.
1,Weak,Sounds like someone who teaching herself how to use 80's era music technology. This is something I would expect from a kid trying to sound like Art of Noise.
5,Little House on the Prairie (Christmas at Plum Creek),This is one of my favorite Christmas Movies and was so glad that I ordered as my VHS is no longer working and I needed to update.
4,Good Fun and Good Value,"I bought this Thomas train set for my 3 year old son's birthday and though he likes it, my 12 years old son seems to be enjoying it more. I had another train & tracks from the another Thomas set and I think for this set to be really fun you should definitely invest in another train and some more track. My boys make different track patterns and enjoy racing the trains. I would recommend this toy since my kids seem to enjoy it.I definitely give it 5 stars for durability because my little boy is not the most careful [like any other 3 years old] and the train has withstood all the falls and throws - not a scratch. I like the fact that the battery component is securely hidden under the train and even gives me a challenge to get to the battery."
4,Decent price for the CL-52,"Decent price for canon ink. Just started using this printer, not real happy with the ink price or how fast we are using ink"
4,It is an ink cartridge,"well, it is a replacement cartridge. what can one say??? it works well. it came fast. but i like it because it was about 40 percent cheaper than other sources. so yes, heck yes, i like it."
3,Good but expensive,This cartridge produces excellent print quality but seems a bit overpriced. It contains enough ink to print a reasonable number of pages.
5,awesome even dubbed,"This is a collection of the first half of Zeta Gundam, trust me this is worth it the animation is mid-80s but still holds up even on my 50 inch plasma. You will notice that the voice acting is top notch which can be hard to come by, well then again i did own the HKBL(Hong Kong Bootleg) version before hand.In this half follow Kamille Bidan age 15 through space and around the Earth meeting Amuro Ray and Char Aznable.and the tragedies of war like knowing the people whom you fight and haveing to pull the trigger anyways."
2,???,"This game looks great, but the gameplay (in my opion) could really use work. The matches are WAY to short. It's a little too shallow for my blood. ButI don't know you so rent it, cause YOU might like it."
4,Buddy Rich,Very enjoyable and interesting. Warning : Seeing the footage of Buddy playing one of his last performances was a little sad.
1,Bad Design,"I have replaced two of these nozzles and am now on my third one that has stopped working. It has a poor design that causes the nozzle to be stuck on. You can hold the black button continuously or click the yellow button to lock it in place. The problem occurs when you go to unlock it, it gets stuck and will not release. I am replacing these with cheaper, higher quality nozzles."
4,Romance and mystery with a touch of old west history,"Tess Farraday has woven a great story of love and mystery with some history of the Comstock area. ""Shadows in the Flame"" is a entertaining story that kept me involved to the end. I found myself walking the streets of Virginia City with the characters and feeling a part of the time. The book is well worth your time. Be prepare to enjoy."
1,The False Promise of Waldorf Education,"Todd Oppenheimer attacks ""technology"" in schools in a one-sided biased rant that would make a fundamentalist blush, and then endorses the Waldorf system. If he were a careful journalist, surely he would know that Waldorf was founded by the racist Nazi Rudolf Steiner, who is still revered within the system today. Yet he either ignored or missed this essential fact. Sloppy biased journalism is too prevalent in our society."
5,A Great Book From an Honorable and Careful Journalist,"Todd Oppenheimer is one of the most meticulous and respected journalists I have ever had the pleasure to come across. He would be the last person to advocate or disparage any school (or school of thought) on a whim or on the basis of some hidden orthodoxy. This a finely crafted and complex book. If you are a professional educator or a parent, you'll be glad for Oppenheimer's help assessing the state of modern education."
2,An assembly of Wayne-Films Trailer,"A couple of years ago I assemled a number of Wayne-Film Trailors and put them on a DVD. This DVD reminds me a lot of what I did then. Nothing newfor a fan,"
1,Bad Design,These are awful. They're heavy. They're unwieldy. The shape of the spoons doesn't work. And they have a 1-1/2 T. spoon instead of a 1/2 T. spoon. Their old round ones were great.
2,Unsatisfactory,"The stainless steel resembles tin, finish is unsatisfactory, easily bent, and they are lightweight. Not worth the postage to return them."
2,"PUREPOSITIVE OF FAIRVIEW, OREGON SENT WRONG ITEM","I OREDERED WOW WORSHIP YELLOW FROM 2003, A TWO DISK SET OF 32 TRACKS; THESE PEOPLE SENT ME ONLY THE FIRST DISK OF WOW WORSHIP BLUE FROM 1999. OBVIOUSLY THE PACKER HAS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF CLASSICAL CHRISTIAN MUSIC !!!!!I HAVE REQUESTED THE SELLER TO CORRECT THEIR ERROR; BUT I REALIZE THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO SINCE THEY ARE ONLY A THIRD PARTY VENDOR, AND NOT A PART OF AMAZON CORPORATION !!!!!i THINK THIS IS A HUGE RIP-OFF; caveat emptor !"
5,The BEST WOW CD to date!,"Although every one of these WOW CD's are great, this one is over the top! The CD would have been worth it if it came with just one, but a double CD with all of the great music and artists makes it the best.There will be tempo in here for everyone, and the song selection is just plain fantastic. Pop this in your car on your way to work and show up happy and energetic. Pop it back in on the way home from a long day and you will at your destination calm and relaxed.This is a great purchase that you can't go wrong with."
2,WOW worship music,"I enjoy the WOW music CD which I purchased. My only problem with this is,unless I am close to and loggged in to an internet connection I cannot listen to this. I thought, the music would be downloaded in to my kindle. Apparently this does not happen. The music/cd is out there in ""internet world"" and cannot be listened to unless you are close to an internet connection. Since we live in a rural area I am unable at times to listen to this music, which I thought I purchased! Next time I will just purchase the CD."
5,The WOW albums are great because . . . . . . . . . .,"What makes these compilations so great is that the songs ARE NOT always performed by the original artist or songwriter. The reason this is so special is because you get to hear other artists take on a song that makes it almost it's own new song. An example of this would be ZOE Girl's version of ""Jesus, Lover Of My Soul"" from WOW Red. The song by itself is great, but then ZOE Girl's version adds tons of power and depth. Another great thing about the WOW series is that when the original artist does perform, they may do a modified version of the song that you cannot get anywhere else. An example of this is ""Draw Me Close "" from the Katinas on WOW Yellow or Chris Tomlin & Steven Curtis Chapman doing "" We Fall Down"" from WOW Red. I love hearing different artists sing the same praise songs because they bring a different flavor and vibe to the song. The WOW series are worth every penny and THE BEST praise & worship music around!"
3,Wow Worship Yellow,"The songs done by the original artists are 5 star, but the ones sung by stand-in artists are 1 star, which dilutes the value of the entire CD. Examples of extreme disappointments are: Awesome God NOT sung by Rich Mullins, a really weak and poor rendition of Shout to the Lord NOT sung by Darlene Zscheck (I know I misspelled her name, sorry), Amy Grant's really weak and poor singing of I Can Only Imagine, etc. I am glad I listened to the samples first; I definitely won't buy this CD."
5,Excellent watch,"I am compleltely satisfied with all aspects of this watch purchase. Looks even nicer than the pics and great service, quick delievry and a great price."
3,runs fast,Only had it a month and need to send it to the factory as it runs fast. last Seiko lasted 15 years with no problems.
4,seiko automatic,This is a beautiful watch to look at. The band looks great. Only con is that the reserve time is too limited- less than 40 hrs.
4,Soldiers and Snowballs,"I tried several times to rent this. The rental place determined it had been stolen. I know why now. This picture ranks with many of the coming-of-age war pictures that question war and its meaning. I am a high school teacher and would love to integrate this fine film into my war unit. However, because it is rated ""R"", like what war movie worth its celluloid isn't, will have to be a suggestion. I will,however, investigate the book. I was moved by this film's integrity and honesty. Hooray again for Gary Sinese and Peter Berg. As always, Ethan Hawke captures the eye and the heart. Enjoy a picture worth your time."
3,Ethan Hawke = Poor man's Tom Cruise,"This movie is good, but once I found out that it was filmed in Utah, I could not imagine the story taking place in the Belgium forest (the high mountains in the background scenery gives the location away).Also, I think the plot would have been more believable if it had occured AFTER the Battle of the Bulge. The screenwriter forgot that this major German offensive caught the American frontline forces completely by surprise. Watching the Intelligence squad's four survivors escape in a jeep during the German attack on the chateau is Hollywood cliche', and then seeing the four guys carry a corpse around for miles while on foot, and encountering NO Germans, is completely bogus.Oh well, I guess there simply isn't any war movie that is truly believable.See ""Born on the Fourth of July"" for a better anti-war movie.BTW, Frank Whaley is in both ""Midnight Clear"" and ""Born on the Fourth..."""
2,Real Clear,"My review will be short. Real short. As short as this movie should have been. It is real clear that there is little to like about this bummer of a movie other than pretty convincing period scenery. The ending is as clear, as trite, as predictable as they come. The characterizations are even worse. If you wanna cry, go stub your toe on the couch and watch something better."
2,"Good Story, B Movie.","The story is set in late 1943 but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting. A decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake, but maybe not."
1,Worst WWII Movie Out in years,"... I bought this from Amazon and found it terrible. As I said in my first review, in this movie, based at Christmas time, a group of Germans on the front try to surrender. It all goes off badly since they put a American as point guard who has no clue what is going on and opens fire, killing all Germans. Unrealistic and not becoming of American Forces---the point guard in the movie should have been sent to the rear for much needed mental health care and was not. ..."
1,Do not rent this movie!!!,"If the United States army had been full of the type of soldiers portrayed in this film, we would have lost World War II. Poor script, poor acting. I was disappointed that Amazon didn't provide the option of NO stars!"
5,A Midnight Clear is one of the best WW2 movies ever.,"It shows the horrors of war very realistically. It also shows the sadness, unsureness and yes even the humor of men in war. This plot was very interesting; not the most original but a first of its kind I've seen from Hollywood. Ethan Hawke pulls off a strong preformance as a 19 yr. old Intelligence and Reconnaisance sergeant who doesn't really want to be in the war. Gary Sinise, Frank Whaley and the rest are wonderful too. Seeing this movie made me want to read the book (also *very* excellent, read it!) The screenplay, as I saw after reading the novel, most of the time literally took the words off the page and put them into the script. A very rare thing amongst movie adaptions. I put this movie in my top 3 strictly-militant-point of view movies of WW2 from the American side. 1. Saving Private Ryan 2. When Trumpets Fade 3. A Midnight Clear In short, WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
5,Classic,"The cinematography is superb, the script is perfect and the acting is second to none. A little known classic about a group of soldiers, who want out. Recommended to everyone!"
2,Very dissapointing!,"This is another of those anti-war movies disguised as a war movie. It was full of big name actors but I had never heard of the movie and could not figure out why.....then I watched it and found out. None of the characters were developed enough to get to care about them. None of them showed any of the gritty toughness you normally would associate with vets who served in the Ardennes battle.This was more like a bunch of guys with attitudes more befitting a Vietnam war movie than a WWII flick.I thought the idea behind the story had possibilities was I had no connection to the main characters so was left flat. I would stay away from this one if you are a big WWII movie buff like I am. Try the Saints & Soldiers movies instead. They are well acted, good story, and lots of action."
2,"A decent movie, but this is no masterpiece....","I am surprised at the amount of praise that this movie is getting on Amazon. A Midnight Clear is a thoughtful WWII drama with some nice sets and a decent amount of well crafted exterior shots. However, the story becomes fairly predictable as you pass the mid way point, and the acting ranges from very good to horribly, insultingly, goofball . Technically there are many flaws, poorly lit scenes, terrible sound production, overuse of certain music themes, poorly crafted replica uniforms, etc. Don't get me wrong, A Midnight Clear is an entertaining movie, but comparing it to Saving Private Ryan is ludicrous."
4,Great movie!,The movie isn't your typical American hero type war movie. Like the characters that develop through the movie.
2,Not a very believable war movie.,"Once you've seen Band Of Brothers a movie like this is just not very believable. Neither the acting nor the story are very convincing. A lot of details that made BoB so realistic are over looked (but remember, this movie was made a few years prior to BoB).[I'll leave the synopsis up to the other reviewers.] This is a 'When Trumpets Fade' style of movie though WTF is better in my opinion. If you like WTF you might like this. But if BoB is what you judge all war movies by this one will probably disappoint you."
1,Rid the world of pan & scan,Everyone has a handful of titles that they just wait and wait patiently(?) to be released on DVD. This is one of mine. Imagine my surprise to find that this release only contains the pan & scan version of the film. Hands down one of the best looking wartime films out there. The cinematography is/was breathtaking. I'm basing this on the distant memory of seeing it in the movie theatre since there has never been a letterbox version of the movie released. What a golden opportunity!! - Lost! The powers that be at Columbia decided that the old dinosaur pan & scan was the best way to release this film. Sorry to rant on like this but I think it's because the ultimate insult occurs on the back of the DVD package where there are three 1:85 still shots from the film - what a slap in the face.
5,An Underrated Film,"This is one of the most underrated war (or anti-war) films of all time. The story is a familiar one: a group of American and German soldiers call their own unauthorized truce during the holidays and learn that the enemy isn't such an enemy after all. The original took place in WWI; this one is ""updated"" to WWII. (Paul McCartney even used the storyline in an early music video-- Tug of War, I think.) But never has the story been told so eloquently and beautifully as in this film. If you're looking for an inspirational movie for the holidays-- one that doesn't involve Santa Claus, angels, or Ebenezer Scrooge-- you should definitely consider ""A Midnight Clear."""
3,"A good, but not great, war movie.","I am a bit of a war movie buff. After hearing good word of mouth and reading the glowing reviews on this website, I rented the movie. I was slightly dissapointed. The movie was good and the characters were interesting but the acting seemed a bit flat. The story also seemed a bit strained and at times pushed into the ""unbeleivable zone."" The end was dramatic and tragic but I didn't feel inspired or enlightened by the story. I can't believe all of the reviews claiming that this is the greatest war movie of all time or how this film could be anyone's favorite movie. It has the look and feel of a B movie. So rent it before you buy it and there are many other war movies out there much better than this one. I'd recommend Gallipoli, Stalingrad, When Trumpets Fade, Band of Brothers, Private Ryan, Blue Max, All Quiet on the Western Front, Come and See, Das Boot, shall I go on?"
2,"Great Movie, Bad Move on Columbia's part","Why would Columbia transfer a great war movie on a Pan & Scan version only? If any movie deserves to be kept in it's widescreen format, it should be this one. Get into the program guys, Widescreen is the future. Please release this one in a Special Widescreen Edition!!!"
3,"If you liked ""When Trumpets Fade"" your like this movie too.","This is not a movie about the so called Glories of war but it is a much darker and grittier work similar too ""When Trumpets Fade"". The budget on this one is not huge nor does it contain any large battles but the cast is good and has several notable actors...worth buying."
2,"A Serious Mistake On This Dvd Release,","Basically i concure with the positive reviews stated previously about *A Midnight Clear, however the problem with this Dvd release of *A Midnight Clear is that it was altered from its original widescreen aspect ratio into a 4.3 pan&scan ratio, this is a real problem with the visual caliber of this film. It is definitly a HUGE mistake on the side of Columbia Tristar. I really love this film but I will not purchase this butchered version which is missing a lot of video content, I do not recommend the purchase of this Dvd version."
2,"Another Release, still full frame","What is it with this movie? This is the third time it has been released on DVD and it's still full frame! I own the 2002 version, the only thing different appears to be the cover art. I guess I am a little confused because it was originally released in the theaters in widescreen."
4,Real enough,"This is one of those great little movies you discover once in a while. Too bad it's in full screen.With all do respect to reviews that say this movie is accurate as opposed to those who say it isn't, I'm on your side but...It's a story! A movie!For example, We Were Soldiers is as realistic as possible portrayal of soldiers and their familys, Apocolypse Now is surealism, Full Metal Jacket and Catch 22 are satire. Unless a movie is totally stupid, judging it by how 'accurate' it is has been getting really irritating. It's a trend that's been going on since saving private ryan and it really misses the point of the stories and ideas being expressed.It's like saying 'I didn't like Blade Runner because there are no such things as Robots' 'I hated Finding Nemo because fish don't talk.""I get irritated by bad continuity or crazy stretching of the truth but can we drop the 'accuracy' thing whenever we don't neccessary like the ideas being expressed."
4,Very intelligently made war movie,"This is one of the great WWII movies. Very refreshing to see something that is not just another portrayal of a platoon ripping through Europe. I would strongly reccomend this one along with Saving Private Ryan and When Trumpets Fade (HBO I think). I would also reccomend reading ""The Big Red One""-I haven't seen the movie, but the book is wonderful."
1,Dated Book from Dated Authors,"This book would have been helpful--if it had been written twenty years ago. Oh, I'm sorry; it already was. The authors (mainly Engel) use ten-year-old examples from books they wrote over twenty years ago, putting them some thirty years out of step with the way missions are mainly handled today. They shoot themselves in the foot by citing several current examples of missions' organizations they claim are doing it right. If they had done this in a positive, helpful manner rather than a smug, superior attitude, this book may have been of some use.This is just another example of Christian authors making a quick buck by rehashing stale examples to make themselves sound like they still know what they are talking about. The review in Christianity Today magazine really says it all. Disappointing."
3,athofden is wrong,"First of all Christianity is not a Western religion, it is a universal religion. Second, Christianity originated in the East. The original Christian missionaries came from the East to the West. Also, first Christian churches were in the East. Christianity is not racist; quite the opposite. It would be racist to not try to save other races from eternal punishment and separation from the only true God."
3,Pretty good ending for the series...,"I've enjoyed the Worldwar series for about two months now. The books were rather long, but the stories were fun. Striking the Balance was a decent ending for the series, nothing over the top or anything, but just slowly dying down. It was refreshing to see the superpowers coming to terms with the invaders instead of blowing each other to Kingdom Come. Turtledove did a good job of transforming certain characters: ie. Heinrich Jager (from Wermacht panzer colonel to turncoat helping the Jews of Lodz, Poland against SS super-commando Otto Skorzeny) and Liu Han (from Chinese peasent women to a Communist guerilla under Mao Tse-Tung and Nieh Ho-T'ing). I also liked how many of the humans were worse than the aliens, which was a nice change of pace from your run-of-the-mill vicious invaders from space. Turtledove also gave me the feeling that the world is to change drastically in the years to come, which makes me look forward to the Colonization series."
3,Left In The Lurch,"I have enjoyed this particular series very much, especially as it is very difficult to obtain copies in SA. However, I think Mr Turtledove has left his readers in the lurch with this episode. A truce is hardly a conclusion. All a long the human race was fighting a superior technology but were catching up fast. A draw was a possibility but unthinkable, expecially given the speed of human technology development compared with that of the Lizards. But, please oh please Mr Turtledove -- you cannot just write off the impending arrival of the Lizard colonisation fleet. At that point, no matter how or what, sparks have just gotta fly. And giving them the Sahara Desert is just not a solution."
2,"After a real flogging, this horse is finally dead!","Turtledove must have had a golfing appointment and needed to finish his excellent Word War series in a hurry.After three exciting books, this final volume was a real let down, with main characters being led through one pointless situation after another until they either died a trivial death or just dissapeared in a puff of banality. I have found that epic, multi volume series are very difficult for authors to finish off as well as they began them (such as Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series), and this one is no different.Unfulfilling and ultimately a grab for cash is the unfortunate fate of this work."
2,Good story - bad editing,"I'm a glutton for punishment I guess - once I start something I can't finish. This is a great story idea with interesting, and well thoughtout characters and plotlines. The writing style though leaves a lot to be desired. I highly doubt I'll be picking up any more of this authors books.There's a huge problem with the whole series - it's written as though each chapter was published in a monthly magazine. There's extensive review and repitition at the beginning of every character's section of a chapter. I first noticed this in the second book, and by the fourth, it's really become bothersome. A competent editor could have trimmed this repition out, and possibly delivered a much tighter story in 3 books."
5,Many different people fend off an alien invasion during WWII,"Take World War II, add an alien invasion and massive occupation, through in Hitler with the Atomic Bomb."
4,"So, what happened to the colonization fleet in the 60's?","I liked the series.The lizards are a little too Earthlike - what's the probability of such similar lifeforms on such widely separated planets - but he saved a lot of boring description by making them reptiles.Given that alternative history requires something a sleepy reader will catch, the alien landing is a satisfactory device to force an alliance between enemies. I liked the way Turtledove depicted a consistently manaical and duplicious Hitler.What I didn't like was Turtledove's lack of coverage of the return of the aliens.So, How about a fifth volume?"
3,Save yourself!!! Run!!,"I did not mean to commit myself to this series. It was a mistake and, like after that first salted peanut, you're hooked. If I were you, I wouldn't have that first peanut.I started the first book and got engrossed before I knew just how LONG this series is. This is number 4 and, let's face it, this one doesn't really wrap it up. Yes, I could have given up the series, but it is interesting and you do feel a commitment to the characters. The repitition is irritating as is the slowness of some of the scenes.Take my advice: stay away, while you can."
1,Thank God It's Over,"Unfortunately, I was sucked into this book series by the idea behind the books. What could have been a fantastic series was totally destroyed by an author who has no concept of the written word. Mr. Turtledove, I GET IT ALREADY! For God's sake, get on with your story. Every aspect of this series was described, in detail, mutiple times throughout the book. There is no need for the reader to do any thinking while reading these books because the author has taken it upon himself to describe at great length every connection a reader can make for himself. If you are thinking of buying this book, be warned...you will be sucked in so that you have to finish them, but you will wish you hadn't."
5,A Solid Read - Lansdale Strikes Again,"Fans of Joe Lansdale know him to be an author with a truly original voice. At times, he can fall prey to a love of kitsch and drive-in movies and hit a few sour notes, but his work is always very readable and well worth the purchase. This book is no exception, and in fact, is quite exceptional.Combining a winning heroine with a western noir plot, SUNSET takes the protagonist through hell, and then follows her as she slowly claws out of it, partially through of the assistance of friends. She's simply too strong-willed and focused to allow anyone to stand in her way, and she makes for one of the most enjoyable characters that Lansdale has written in years. I highly recommend this book to fans of crime fiction, westerns, great character dramas and frankly, anyone that enjoys reading a good yarn on a nice summer day.Keep an eye on Joe's work - he is a wonderful writer that rarely lets his readers down."
3,"Good reading and story by Lansdale, too bad it's abridged","The only reason to read this abridged audio book is because Joe Lansdale hisownself is reading it. Joe has that Texas drawl that fits the story perfectly as its set in depression era Texas. Now he's not the best reader, but because of his drawl and its his own story make it a must to listen to.The story is pretty decent too, not great, but decent. It starts off where a woman kills her husband who is the local constable and eventually takes over the position. And she finds a whole heap of corruption that has been going on in the area on the account of the new oil that is being found in Texas. This is a mystery story by Lansdale and while not bad, it's not one of his best mysteries. Still it was a great listen, as Joe hisownself read the story."
2,Writing Women Characters is not his strength.,"As a big fan of the Hap & Leonard novels, I found this novel to be a disappointment. It never really hooked me. I forced myself to read two thirds of this book but finally gave up because I just wasn't enjoying it, and forcing myself to read it just wasn't worth the time.The author seems to share what I believe to be a common characteristic of most authors; they lack the insight necessary to write believable characters when that character is the opposite sex. In other words, few male authors can write convincing female characters. Likewise, few female authors can write convincing male characters.I look forward to future Hap & Leonard novels, and I will probably try some of his other novels, but I really can't recommend this one."
1,not very satisfying,"I'd consider myself a Lansdale fan, I've read all the short stories, loved the first Hap and Leonard books. But lately...I dunno, I don't finish his books with the same ""what a great read"" feeling I normally have. Captains Outrageous was just bad...it was Hap and Leonard...but it just seemed a chore to finish. With Sunset and Sawdust, the story starts great and then half way through (where we finally meet the real villains) it started to lose me, and by the end, I was kinda mad I started reading it. Anyway. that's just my opinion. If you felt the same way about Captains Outrageous, you might want to give this one a pass too."
5,Great hits,"Another good album to listen to. If you have your favorites of Jim Brickman, you will enjoy this album."
4,Sappy songs and enticing piano at its best!,"I love the relaxed, peace-filled music of Jim Brickman. When my husband heard it, he said he thought he was going to retch. Nonetheless, I find it soothing and highly enjoyable. Obviously others might disagree!"
2,Wow,Great collection of music. But several of the songs do not play on my kindle. Hsve tried several things unable to get some of the music to play.
5,God Candy Review,I think this is one of the best cd's out there for Christians and the struggle with dating and also keeping your relationship with God. I would recommend this to anyone. The music is awesome and I love listening to it whenever I need encouragement or a reminder of WHO is really important in my life.
5,"Excellet, best CD I've bought this year.","This is a great cd. Jonathan has improved so much in vocals and the guitar playing is mezmorizing to listen to. Trip if you have to, God Candy, Coffee and Tea, and Shannon's Dance are great songs. I am in awe of thier loyalty to women and their belief in God. Wonderful CD! Buy it and you won't regret it! |_ _|Forever in our memories! I look foward to future albums. Scarlet Road is a great inspiration."
4,"Try it, you'll probably like it!","If you're offended by references to Jesus, this might not be the CD for you, BUT you'd be missing out on some pretty cool music. It's a great blend of sounds. The guitar work is awesome!!! In a word -- COOL!!! Try it, you'll probably like it!"
5,Best Watch Ever!!,This watch comes in like every color i have the pink and the black bands. It goes with everything. I just love it!!
1,Exorcist: The Beginning,Boring and badly written. Cliche after cliche trying to sound intelligent. Caleb Carr probably regrets being associated with this BOMB.
5,Really helpful spiritual classic,"I must admit that John Cassian is one of my favourite spiritual writers so I wasn't surprised to find that I enjoyed this collection of his conversations as well. The main reason I rate it so high is that it is better value than any of the other editions which are available. I do recommend any of John Cassians writings that you can get hold of, and at the price this is probably the best edition at the moment of this particular work."
3,Good book but people should put their thinking caps on....,"His book is very informative but a fair amount of work in involved. Many people don't understand all that is involved in getting grants. So for many of them the books are not as useful as they should be. People need positive and realistic approaches with LOTS of elbow grease. With this mindframe they can profit for his book. Two good books are ""Grants for Dummies"" and ""Government Funding and You"". Both books are realistic and they can help anyone get registered and start seeking grants SERIOUSLY.-Kelli"
1,Waste of money,"This is the same product he sells under many different covers. Except for the cover, the material is the same and much of it is out of date."
5,A delightful story with a lovable villain.,I would rate this one the best of the series. Samuel Whiskers and Anna Maria are delightful villains with their mannerisms and personalities. Lovely music track we actually found on a tape which includes many songs from the Beatrix Potter series. The naughty kittens are wonderful with their quaint sayings and childish ways. A family favorite! I love the English voices and settings. Original art animated.
1,Absolutely dreadful,"I find it hard to fathom that the inventive, quirky group which produced the classic ""From A to B"" could also have put their name to a record as execrable as ""Warp"". Every song comprises a bad tune, a weedy voice and a cheap ""beep beep bop bop"" from a synthesiser. From start to finish this work sounds as though it was made by two teenagers goofing off in their bedroom one afternoon. I read somewhere once that Tony Mansfield (the brain behind New Musik) considered ""Warp"" to be the weakest of the group's records and he's certainly right there, as long as you substitute the words ""most abysmal"" for ""weakest"". I really, really regret paying out for this CD. I beseech you to avoid it."
2,cheap imitation of the original design,"Much better versions out there, and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one, then conserve, for a disposable model"
4,relatively unknown royal offers facinating account of her life,"A relatively unknown royal offers facinating account of her life, and the life of a royal in the 1940s. Well written and full of interesting details about her life and the life of the royals."
4,Solid Book,Great book to get you started with Linux Admin. Covers many issues a sys admin is expected to know. However it doesn't cover ftp. It just mentions it.It has a pretty good chapter on sendmail.To get your server up and running I would recommend Kabir's RedHat book.Stanfield's book will help you mantain the server.Don't miss the all new Linux Administration Handbook ISBN 0-13-008466-2.
4,"good book, more interesting in real life","this was a good book. i'd like to get that out before hand. i think that in real life, the actual event was more mysterious and intriging. while i'm not rating a movie, i think that an event that captured an entire nation's attention and sombody accused of killing ""the eaglet"" that everybody hated, could have used a better book. i would suggest reading about the ""Lindbergh Kidnapping"" before you read this book, so you don't get lost."
5,Unbelievable!!!,"I bought this set for my girlfriend who is a film student. She absolutely loves it. I own several other DVDs from this production house and they have all been great.If you are a student or an enthusiast, then you have to own these."
2,Skip these and get the LED's instead,"It is the right replacement for my Fridgidaire dispenser light but the first bulb went out after a month so I ordered this(2-Pack LED Night Light bulb, Multipurpose 0.36 Watt (5W Replacement), E12 Candelabra Base, Warm White, Lifetime Guarantee by G7 Power) and would recomend you skip this incandescent and buy the LED instead for your fridge. Works perfect and I should never have to replace again while using less electricity in the process."
1,Not what I thought I was getting.,"I searched for a 6 watt, 12 volt bulb. This was one of two choices that came up. I ordered both to be safe. The other one was perfect. This one was a 6 watt 120 volt bulb, exactly what I didn't want. The bulb itself is ok, but your information about it was deficient!"
5,"Handy, bright, and long lasting","I've had one of these for years. The batteries it uses are among the least expensive watch/electronis batteries. I don't use it a lot, but I think it was maybe 5 years before I had to change the batteries. My AA and AAA always seem to need new batteries even if I rarely use them.It is nice that it just works when I need it. The light is very bright and the size makes it handy to just keep around. For scale, a AA battery is about 1/2"" shorter than this. The diameter is less than a C sized battery although it has that clip on the side that makes it maybe that wide in that direction.The only problem I have is that I've had it so long (6 years? 7 years?) there's now a crack in the lens housing. It is water resistant and I think I over tightened the lens housing down which eventually caused the crack. It's still fine and I was just checking prices in case I wanted a new one. Glad to see they still make it."
3,"OK, but could be better","This flashlight is super-tough, and very compact too. It is made out of a high-tech plastic that is all but impossible to break. It it bright enough to be useful. My only beef with it is that it uses four LR44 (alkaline) or SR44 (silver-oxide) button cell batteries, stacked up. What this means, is that instead of relying on two contact points (top & bottom of battery) it relies on five. AS the light is thrown around in a bag, sometimes, those contact points become dirty, and the light doesn't work. Very irritating.I recommend finding a light this size that runs on 1 AA or AAA battery with a regulated output. Gerber makes some. (Infinity Ultra?) They may be just slightly bigger, but much easier to find batteries for, and more reliable due to fewer necessary electrical contacts."
3,Not bad but...,"Not bad but also not very bright. I like that I could put in a red lens. For the size, it could be better and much brighter."
5,"Amazing, tiny and indestructable","This light is perfect. I've owned mine for a few years now, as well as several other pelican lights. They've all been a joy to own. The size of the light is suprising because the output is that of a large light . the outer shell is some kind of indestructable plastic. Mine is covered in scars from god knows the kinds of things its been through since I've owned it. It still works perfectly. Lr44 batteries are cheap on ebay as well as the 6v stack. There is a noticable difference after peak battery life. The lanyard is flimsy, but replace it with a promotional one you got for free somewhere because without something attached to it, its so small, you're gonna lose the light. If you want a light smaller than your hand and less than $20, it doesn't get any better."
4,"Very true to the TV series, but didn't like the ending.","I'm a big fan of the ""Sabrina, the Tenage Witch"" show, so when I discovered the series of novels, I got excited. This was the first one I read.I liked it, for the most part. The book's very true to te TV series, including the creative use of puns to enhance magic. Check out the Spellman family tree for an example of what I mean.The only thing that really made this book go down for me was the ending. It seemed to me that her truth sprinkles revealed one thing to Sabrina in the middle of the book, and helped her do something almost completely opposite in the end of the bok. I can't say more without giving the ending away. It really bugged me, though.Still, if you like Sabrina, I'd check out the series. There were several spots where I laughed out loud."
4,OH NO!!!,"The whole school is going arye!! everyone is parring up with the wrong people! Libby likes the neardiest guy none to High School! (in Libby's appionyn before now) So What?? it's not until Harvey and Jenny (or was it Val?) find 'hidden love' that Sabrina gets worred. and this new guy (who is cute, but come on, Sabrina likes HARVY) named Quenten Pid likes Sabrina. What's she sapposed to do?????! it's a great Sanbina so get it!!!"
3,Its an OK Book,"Gee, I was pretty excited to read this, I mean, my second Sabrina book...etc. But...I was a bit disappointed. I don't know why. Well anyway. it's an exciting book!! It's shocking that the new guy was actually....Whoops! I'm starting to reveal the plot! Well, I won't!! I like the storyline, the characters, but there was something lacking. It's a funny book too. Especially when she tried the ""frog"" thing....."
5,Perfect service.,We received the CD in Idaho in about 10 days from the UK. The CD was as expected and plays beautifully.
4,definitley worth your while,I am a newly found SELF fan and this cd blows me away every time I hear it. It's incredible how every song is done with toy instruments. It makes me wonder why noone has ever thought of it before. It is a must-have and a great investment for anyone who appreciates good music.
2,disappointing title from a great band,When I first heard of the realease of the new Self album I ran to the stores to buy it. My joy was stopped short after I listened to it. What is this? It sounds nothing like the weird yet genious music that has made me come to love this band. The only reason I would buy this cd is if you are a huge Self fan but warning: prepare for a letdown.
4,"Odd, But Addicting","Catchy hooks, choruses that will stick in your head, and beats to tap your foot too, and all made with toys. Gizmodgery is quite an accomplishment. Although I love the disc and would be delighted to tell everyone to go out and buy it, I must say that the album is a bit eclectic, and could be a bit much for some people's tastes. If you are just getting into Self, then I would recommend picking up ""Breakfast With Girls"" before this. I don't think it's a better album, but it is slightly more mainstream and not as off the wall."
5,Loud and Clear,"I just read that people are saying this album is only made with toys. I can hear loud and clear that there is drums, guitars/pedals, keyboard drum loops, and more. This album is five stars and as always from Self very imaginative. Listen to the samples, you can pick out the instruments."
5,GET IT,"THE BOMB, O-K! GET ALL THREE VOLUMES OF THIS, P-LEASE! IT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! ALSO, GET JAZZY SOUL, VOL. 1-3. FOR SMOOTH & COOL FOLK ONLY, OR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE."
5,Learn the Full Range of Encaustic Possibilities,"Daniella's video is truly a pleasure to watch. She shares her wealth of knowledge with the viewer, never leaving out any steps - you can follow her instructions and you WILL have success! In spite of the volume of information Daniella gives the video never gets bogged down - it moves right along at an excellent speed. The information is thorough but easy to understand.Daniella goes through a full range of possibilities and alternatives that can be tried with encaustic. She loves to experiment but never loses sight of the underlying requirements for creating sound encaustic artwork. An amazing amount of practical information is included. You can watch the video again for a refresher as needed, and you will notice new ideas and possibilities that you missed the first time around!I really recommend this video to anyone who wants to try encaustic - Daniella will give you a sound background that will let you be successful the first time around!!"
1,Warning: No textiles,"WARNING: the Textile Sensibility in this DVD is non-existent. Yes, she USED to be a textile artist. But never does she say what effect that has on her encaustic work, nor is that effect evident. Yes, she does sew things together, but not textiles. I bought this hoping for an intro to using fabrics in encaustic paintings. Except for five seconds at the very end, when she waves two pieces of fabric she had dipped in wax, fabric is not mentioned. Had she not put ""Textile"" in the title of the DVD, I would not have expected textiles, and would have been completely satisfied with what she did present. Unfortunately for me and my pocketbook, she implied textiles had something to do with this DVD. They don't."
2,"A Christian film, but not a great one","When such a mediocre effort as this is called a great Christian movie, it's sad for movie lovers and Christians. If this is the best Christians can do in cinema, they deserve to stay in the minority-propoganda-films-for-a-few niche they currently occupy.The story is a has-been, the production values are no better than a bad TV movie, and the insertion of religion is trite. Though Carmen performed better than I expected, that's still not saying much. He and Stallone could team up -- though don't make the mistake of even mentioning this film in the same breath as ROCKY.Hey, producers, you say you're Christians? Then give us some great movies for a change..."
2,Check it out before spending your money.,I watched it at a friends house. It's not Carman's best. If you can find someone else who had a copy I'd suggest you check it out before shelling out the bucks for your own personal copy.Check it out before spending your money.
1,I liked it but I'm not sure I'd buy it,I watched it at a friends house. It's not Carman's best. If you can find someone else who had a copy I'd suggest you check it out before shelling out the bucks for your own personal copy.Check it out before spending your money.
5,"A Movie With A Message.""The Champion"" scores BIG-TIME!!!!","This movie REALLY delivers a TRULY INSPIRING and HEART-WARMING message to parents and children alike. Lee Stanley does a MARVELOUS job directing this FANTASTIC picture. Buy it. You'll LOVE this film packed with HARD-HITTING action, romance, comedy, drama and NAIL-BITING suspense. This movie-PG in my view-is PERFECT for the WHOLE family. The song that plays at the end of the movie is about the will to persevere in the face of trials and tribulations and knowing that there's One on high watching over us; even though most of us may think otherwise."
1,Dissappionted from Fisrt to Last,"At first I liked it, but after watching it over and over, I got very dissapointed in Carman. The story was dragging it's way to the end, and the it just seemed so terriable. I think Carman should just stick to singing instead of acting. The acting was a total loose, and I just couldn't watch any more of it. I respect Carman's way of praising God, but I wish he could have made this movie more exciting than it already is. There was so many secnes I didn't care to watch and so many things I just couldn't get. I just couldn't take it anymore. Next time, if there is one I pray that he will do a better job at making a good story, and doing some serious acting. This one to me was a major flop."
1,"""Christian"" Rocky","""The Champion"" is basically a ""Christian"" version of Rocky 6. The producers go so far as mimicking the cutaway shots of his love interest (read: Adrian) hiding her face when her meal ticket gets pummeled by a menacing champion (read: Mr.T pummeling Stallone). Carman is nicknamed ""Preacher"" but all is thrown out the window when he lays eyes on the mother of a juvenile delinquent that he has handcuffed to a chair. He ogles her rear end after she leaves with the boy. A few scenes later, Carman accompanies the woman after they cannot find the boy in his makeshift gym/church. Upon finding the boy, Carman seizes the opportunity to comfort the boy's foxy momma and slips his tongue down her throat while her son lays asleep in the backseat. Even ""Rocky"" wouldn't stoop this low. This film has characters every bit as shallow as any Hollywood b-movie with the exception being that the main hero mentions that he has ""faith"" as a throw away line..."
4,Carman-The Champion,"I enjoyed this movie, Carman protrayed the role he was playing as Leone (the boxer) very well. I think the movie protrayed what it was trying to express, that if you have faith enought you can accomplish anything. I would recommend this to other family members and friends."
4,"Good, Not Great.","This movie was good. But in saying that, there were a couple of places that I feel were compromised and it lacked integrity, but other than that, wow! But the reason above is my reason for only 4 stars.Like some Christian movies, I really didn't know what to expect. This was just as good as any boxing movie I've ever seen. It was a great message and I'd recommend it to anybody, including a non-believer. I was inspired by Orlando's faith and dare to stand up to the heat when the odds were against him."
4,this was a good movie i like carman more all the time,this was a great way to get god word to people that may never have heard it before that is the most important thing. then the boxing was great. i also loved the music. there needs to be alot more movies made like this one.

2,This Is Denon CD (IMPORT) JAPAN,"If you're collecting stuff with Denon on it this is fine. However,The audio quality could be better and/or/but there's waay too much piano on this.Get's on your nerves after first swing...."
5,Melissa Scott,"I've been a fan of Melissa Scott's fiction for many years and recently found a copy of her book about how to create a Science Fiction novel. I wish more SF authors would follow her advice. She is clear and concise about how to edit down your manuscript and decide how much detail to leave in. If you want to write a novel that I would buy, mine this book for technique. A good SF novel is more than a great idea that you've had while talking to your friends. :) Or you could just follow Harlan Ellison's comment ""A writer is someone who writes"""
2,Not the Best Flavor or Texture,"I'm not surprised that groceries cost more to have shipped than to pick up at one's local store, so I wasn't deterred by that.I have been making a lot of sushi lately, so I got 50-sheet packs each of Sound Sea Vegetables nori and Sushi Chef nori. I have to say I find the Sound Sea Vegetables nori to have a fishier taste, but what I really dislike is its rubbery texture when moistened by the rice, which makes it unpleasantly chewy and even hard to cut.In my opinion, which is not that of an expert or purist, the Sushi Chef noriSushi Chef Nori, 50-Count, 4.5-Ounce Toasted Seaweed Sheetshas a far more pleasant flavor and delicate texture that does not overwhelm the flavor of the filling or make it too chewy to enjoy.Yes it is quite a bit more expensive, but good eating should not have to be unpleasant."
4,Male Buyer Review,"I purchased these in Black XL (I have a 38"" Waist)and they fit great with just a touch of lace. They fit well around the back providing complete coverage and the waist does not ride up past my pants...(Important for guys who like to wear panties.) I always look for complete coverage panties with some feminine aspect. These do the trick and removing the bow make them look a little more appropriate on a guy."
2,Too Depressing for Words,"This book should come with the warning: ""STOP! If you like happy endings"". A little bit of angst is one thing but this was just one disaster after another. Not one charactor was spared a maladramatic suicidal situation and it got old quick. I give it two stars because at least it was well written."
5,Swept away,Very touching and interesting reading. I had plenty of tears when I read this and couldn't put it down.
4,The content is good,"but the production is muddy. Very Britpop sounding, excellent vocals and a very listenable album. If this was remastered then the real talent of these musicians would shine through. Perhaps I will jump ahead to their more current stuff to hear what they are all about."
5,"catchy tunes, good rythme",It contains good music to move to. It has catchy rythmes and lyrics. I would buy more music by this group. West Africain accents are always a pleasure to listen to.
4,Horror meets the afterlife,"Let me start by saying..I AM NOT RELATED TO THIS GUY!! Although my friends got a kick out of seeing the book on my coffee table with my last name. I am not one for reading fiction, and especially not horror (I like to save that for the movies), I must say that this book is pretty cool. A good start for a first time writer, a writer that I hope continues to publish...I might actually buy another book by this guy."
5,Hardbound Book The deadly Messiah,This item is wonderfu..especially for the price !It arrived promptly... and in very good condition.I would purchase again.
3,Deadly Messiah,"This is a book I read when I was in high school. A fast and interesting read even if it is a little dated (I was in high school in the 60's). Good characters, great bad guy...lots of fun to read."
3,"Overall, an uneven album","This CD contains some of the best and some of the worst tracks by Harold Budd. The first four pieces are very good with their beautiful melodies and soft synth sounds. Still, ""Flowered knife.."" has already appeared on the album ""The moon and the melodies"", a collaboration between Budd and The Cocteau Twins. It's called ""Memory gongs"" there. ""Gypsy violin"", a 20-minute megawork, is very whiny and boring, probably the worst track Harold has ever done. I think ""Lovely thunder"" better should have ended up as a CD-Single, eliminating the filler."
2,STILL WAITING AND WAITING AND WAITING!!!!,"I can't give this product a fair review due to I have yet to receive it. It is still on back-order I guess. But hey, it's Harold Budd...it must be good."
4,No experience writing,"I'm satisfied with ""The No-Experience-Necessary Writer's Course"" book. It was very thorough and explained quite a lot on how get started in writing anything. The exercises throughout and at the back of the book are very interesting, yet quite challenging.It has to be challenging enough in order to get one's imagination flowing and keep on going, going, going. Besides, it's great fun to write; especially fiction for me.I would recommend this book to anybody who has always wanted to learn to write."
2,"Overly sweet, and flavor doesn't last","The point of this gum is to take one of the sours and one of the sweets and mix them together. Unfortunately, the sour strawberry tastes much better than the sweet, so although putting them together creates a decent flavor, I always end up throwing away the sweet pieces when chewing them one by one. Also, the flavor doesn't really last very long, and I find I can finish one box in one sitting."
1,Expired Product,"I ordered this product (4 boxes of 12) in late July of this year. When I received the items, they all had a expiration date of June 2008. How so uncaring.Trident Strawberry Fusion Gum (12 count)"
4,Not merely the best--the only one!,"Few in the west knew or cared that Japan and Russia fought a short but major war on the Siberian border in 1939--before the invasion and dismemberment of Poland pitched Europe into WWII.Nomonhan had great meaning for the U.S., because it diverted Japan from its desire to fight Russia and turned it south instead toward U.S., British, and Dutch interests.Very much worth the effort to read it."
4,"Exhaustive, but hamstrung due to lack of Soviet resources.","This book is the authoritative work on the Nomonhan, or Khalkin-Gol battles of 1939. The book is well-written, with excellent battlefield maps. Coox was a Japanese scholar, so it is not surprising that his material leans heavily on Japanese sources. This is a problem in the sense that at the time of publication, there was very little material available from the Soviet side of the conflict, other than Marshal Zhukov's memoirs and a few other similiarly suspect works.However, if you are interested in this little-known but extremely important series of border engagements (the Japanese defeat here strengthened the Navy's 'go south' policy, with disasterous consequences for the European colonial powers) then there is no better reference work than Coox."
3,Reminds me of Christine Feehan's writing style,"I read this last year and liked it a lot more than I did the second time around. After broadening my horizons, so to speak, by reading authors like Karen Marie Moning, Lisa Kleypas, and Alexandra Ivy... I could not get into this story. Roman got on my nerves with his idea of chivalry. Talk about a martyr! Kallista was too hard to be likeable. I can understand coming from a tough background, but this character went overboard in the cynic department. The way they talked didn't make much sense, either. I kept getting lost in the dialogue. I really liked Cait London's Midnight Rider, but this book only gets 2 1/2 stars from me. I didn't hate it, just couldn't understand or get into it."
2,Unless something has changed...,"...""Touch"" by John Klemmer in this collection is actually ""Sleeping Eyes."" Not a bad song in itself, but considering I bought the disc solely for ""Touch,"" I was disappointed.""Claire's Song"" and ""Old Town"" are the only other songs that I bother with on this disc. There are better compilations out there, frankly."
1,Like they said...It leaks,"I heard my boy make the sound he makes after taking a big drink....ahhhhhh! I run to him and find liquid all over his face and clothes. I realize this ring is leaking. I start looking at it for something to search on....brand name, name, product #, uhoh....made in China. Great! I figure its got lead and mercury in the liquid at least. Thankfully, it says just water.Don't buy it."
1,Leaked out before we opened it!,This product had leaked out before we ever used it. We opened it to discover that it was flat. There are many much higher quality soothers out there for which we will be exchanging this one. I was surprised at Fisher-Price for making a product of such inferior quality.
1,Leaked out!,"We got this as a gift at one of our baby showers, but when we opened it we discovered that the fluid had already leaked out before we ever even had a chance to use it! Was an interesting idea with the handle that would not be cold, but was very poorly executed. The overall quality of this product was terrible! Cheap thin plastic!"
3,An OK album of mostly old and unreleased Dogg Pound tracks!,"This CD is made up of tracks that were recorded from the ""dogg food"" era to 1999. Suge continually disses his old artists but constantly releases their music! There are only some good tracks (a lot are very outdated) the good tracks are- Just Doggn' (ft. Nate Dogg) Smoke (Ft. Snoop Dogg) Don't Stop (Ft. The almighty 2PAC) Change the game remix (Jay Z Beanie Sigel Memphis Bleek Daz and Kurupt--Easily the best track) and finally Every single day (Ft Snoop Dogg) If you want some new Dogg Pound stuff i recommend Kurupt's latest ""Space Boogie: Smoke Oddysee"" which i gave 5 stars! Also the independantly released DPG ""Dillinger and young Gotti"" i haven't heard this but it was well recieved when it was released! If you have already got these then buy this but don't expect the qaulity of Space Boogie, Dillinger and Young Gotti and Raw"
4,DPG,"Let me start off by saying i'm a huge DPG fan, and thats the only reason i got this album. I used to love Tha Row, but they're not up to par anymore. I thought this album would sound like ""Dead Man Walkin"", the terrible Snoop Dogg release of low-quality, unfinished tracks and wack beats. However, this album is sweet! A lot of the tracks on this CD are obviously from before the era when Death Row began falling apart. Almost every track on the CD is a banger, and, since 2pac is my favorite rapper (and the best of all time), my favorite track is Dont Stop, which he scorches on. Buy this CD!!!!!!"
4,Dogg Pound Gangsta' 4 life...whens CROOKED I cd coming out ?,Death Row gots a collection of some real gangsta' s**t still on their shelves and their latest Dogg Pound 2002 is worth the money. BUT ... If you know your DPG cds then you would know that this cd took basically a lot cuts from the latest Daz Dillinger cd and the latest DPG cd. But either way this cd is worth buying just to hear some new (old) s**t from the Dogg Pound.
1,Highly Disappointing,"It happened, Tha Dogg Pound has finally come out with a new album. I knew there was no way the new album could reach the awesome status of their first (Dogg Food), because their first album was and still is the best cd I own. It's just so sad to see your favorite rappers go down that long hall of ""MAINSTREAM"" music. Tha Dogg Pound has just made one too many dollars and their hearts were not in this album, their money was. This album is their money speaking, not Kurupt and Daz. Every song on this album sounds the same, and that same sound is just not ""Dogg Food material"". Now, don't get me wrong, there are worse albums, but it was just so disappointing to hear my favorite groups second CD bomb like this has in my own mind. Well, take your own shot, buy it, and judge for yourself."
2,The heavy use of symbolism undermines his study of the text.,"The strongest point of Brodie's commentary is his literary approach which has greatly helped him to organize his work. However, after admitting in his introduction that the theological method of study tended to lend itself to the use of arbitrary symbolism, Mr. Brodie does not seem to make any attempt to curb his use of symbolism as he treats the text of the Gospel of John. This results in his reading into the text elements which are not present instead of trying to dig into the real meaning of the text."
2,Sunk By Subtitles,"I am not who usually complains about subtitles for a foreign movie, but in this case the poor quality of the subtitles detracted from any possible enjoyment I might have gotten, This might have been a much better film than it seemed. The subtitles are terrible - not only is the English translation awkward, sometimes not even making sense, but also the subtitles are often on screen for such a short time that there is no time to read them. This made it very difficult to follow, not to mention that all nuances that might have been in the original were lost."
2,Breaks too easy,Like the color....like the texture / creaminess......too soft and I used it a coupe of times before the lipstick broke in half!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,It's a discovery worth making.,"I knew nothing about Andre a week ago. Then I stumbled upon this album at a local record store. Not only was this HOT, but he had several popular artist on his album. It's only available as an import, but worth the extra. It's very enjoyable for anyone who likes sultry R&B, and modern POP."
4,Classic songs ... less than classic sound quality,"As one who is not a recording technician, I hate to dwell on the sound quality, but this CD would rate more highly if it sounded better. If you can accept that the recordings ARE quite old, this is a very listenable collection of some great songs. Even if you enjoy the swinging Sinatra of the '50s more, you can hear the start of his trademark long phrasing here. Songs like ""I'll be Seeing You"" and ""Imagination"" are timeless, although ""Dolores"" has not aged as gracefully, with a lot of humming and doo-be-doo's that are either charming or annoying, depending on your taste.As far as I know there is no definitive Sinatra-Dorsey collection, but this is one worth considering."
5,FIRST TIME ORDERING A BOOK FROM AMAZON,I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH MY BOOK I COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE AND I FOUND IT ON AMAZON THANK YOU. I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN.KKB
5,LOVE THEM,"I love these tights. Perfect fit (order 1-2 sizes up), supremely soft, extremely comfortable. You'll forget you have them on!"
5,Very cool!!!,I ordered 8 18 inch horror action figures and this one is one that came in the other day. So far he is the most simple of all the toys I have bought but thats not a bad thing with this one. He stands easily and the speaker on him is pretty loud. I am very happy with this purchase he is an excellent adition and a must have for my collection of bad guys. I saw another cheaper 18 inch version of this toy but I just had to have this one with this outfit. ...........Update......... The michael myers pictured above without blood on the outfit is from Neca and the one with blood is from movie maniacs. I ordered the one above and got the one with blood sent to me instead. Not a big deal to me since I bought all 3 18 inch versions but maybe to some other serious collectors out there.
4,michael meyers figure,"I bought this for my husband who is slightly obsessed with michael meyers. he is really happy with it, he walks by it all the time just to activate his ""breathing"". :)"
4,Interesting Fripp side project,"As others have noted, this is very much in the vein of '80s King Crimson, but with a female vocalist.I really wanted to like it better, but I feel the only reason it even remains an often-unnoticed blip on the radar is the presence of Robert Fripp and Trey Gunn, rather that Toyah Wilcox.I'd recommend this to Crimson completists."
1,Absolutely worthless,"Don't put your faith in this device.I've had two cars stolen with this device locked. The first time my car was stolen I though that MAYBE I didn't secure it tight enough, and it might have been my error, and I still had faith in the device. The second car I had stolen, I know for a fact the device was strapped tight and securely, and there was no way I could have made a mistake. That didn't stop the car thief, in fact, I don't think it deterred him one bit.Don't waste your money on this crap."
4,The good and the bad,"Pro: Very easy to install, it takes me few seconds to lock and unlock. Price is very reasonable with free shipping..Cons:Its hard to tell from outside the car that there is a brake lock installed. I wish it came with a blinking LED light.Personally I would have felt a lot safer with this product if my car was not automatic..over all I'm happy and I recommend."
2,Cheap material and not compatible with my car,"Poorly designed, does not work with my Eg civic or Gen 8 Celica. The material is also cheap. Do not recommend this"
3,try another brand next time,"the price is good compare with another brand. but the lock is quite slim and it doesn't look strong enough. another thing is, it doesn't come with the steer wheel cover or other things which can show the car is protected by the brake lock. general performance on the car is not bad tho. but i think next time when i need a brake lock, i'd like to buy another brand instead."
1,Didn't fit my 2000 Civic EX coupe,"For those of you, like me, with one of the more commonly stolen vehicles out on the road...Because of the angle and position of the dashboard and steering column in my 2000 Civc EX coupe, I could not use this product with my car.Thanks to Amazon for having an easy and simple RMA process.(I did end up buying an ""Autolock Pro"" for my car, http://www.amazon.com/Unknown-The-UNBREAKABLE-AutoLock-PRO/dp/B0007ZFTHW . The Autolock Pro does fit my car.)"
1,brake club #CL606,"I tried this on my 2011 F-150,also on my 2005 silverado both crew cabs.I pulled as far as possible and it still came loose."
3,The Club Brake Lock,"Received the item within a few days. Fast shipment. Although I don't like how they make these brake locks nowadays, it's still useful to still have one then to not have one at all. Thank you!!"
1,item suck!!!!,I have 2 cars: VW and nissan. does not fit any of my cars or any german cars.description was not specific. will cost too much too send back. have to pay restocking fees + shipment.very unhappy.
4,Small buddy saves your car,"One advantage of brake pedal lock over steering lock is the car is simply unmovable! This little brake lock does its work very fine (Its Club!). Its easy to use- just pull the latch and brake pedal is unmovable.Two issues:1. Its bit difficult to insert the lock. You need to really practise it to find out perfect position to install. Also for most of vehicle, you need to open door wide to install this.2. It would been good to have a steering cover that gives visual warning that this car has the brake pedal lock installed! This little buddy doesn't catch the eye immediately so the thieves may break the window or door, just to find that the car is simply unmovable. But then you save car but losing the glass window!"
4,An good Anti-Theft Device,I just got the product yesterday and I'm impressed with how quick you can attach the device. It's heavy and made of steel. I actually feel safe with it on my truck. Sure you can saw it off or try to pop the lock some how but not without making a ton of noise in the middle of the night and without me coming down the stairs with my baseball bat. It would take a lot of skill to get it off and at least it keeps away the rookie car burglars.

5,This was a great book,The book Out of Place is a book about two twins Jessica and Elizabeth and a girl named Ginny Lu. The protagonist is Ginny Lu. The conflict in the book is Ginny Lu tries to fit in but she can't because no one will talk to her but Elizabeth.Ginny Lu is a girl from Tennesse that moved to Sweet Valley but she doesn't like it that much. A girl Ellen Riteman is one of the girls that is mean to Ginny Lu. The thing that I like the best is at the end when Ginny Lu and Ellen become friends.
2,This doesn't do justice to the SVT series.,"I loved the Sweet Valley Twins series in elementary school. The books were always so fun to read. This story, however, I really didn't like. It wasn't very intriguing, and it feels like there are several other books in the series that are too similar. In this story, Ginny Lu Culpepper comes from the Appalatians to Sweet Valley. Her different ways lead to her being harrasssed by the popular girls and feeling left out. I didn't like how the popular girls treated Ginny Lu, and I really didn't like Ginny Lu's character. She was too much of a stereotypical hick like on the ""Beverly Hillbillies."" I thought this book was one of worst in the series. If you are considering buying a Sweet Valley Twins book, try another one, because there are so many better than this one."
2,Ginny-lou,A girl called Ginny-Lou visits town and the kids are horrible to her because she is a hilly-billy.Only Elizabethh ill befriend her.
2,Worst Sabbath Album,"Let's get one thing straight. I am a huge Sabbath fan. I have all the albums and have dabbled into their music in the darkest of corners and listened with open ears and mind time and time again. You know how it is when a song is great and it gives you ""The Goosebumps/ Chills""??? Well there is hardly anything on this album that does it for me. Dirty Women is the best song and arrangement on the album. There are no ""great"" tracks besides that, and as hard as I try, I have no love for this record. Never Say Die is far better - as people like to compare the two, but it's no contest. I love Sabbath but this is a downer album for me."
4,Underrated masterpiece.,"I used to think this album was not good, and I listened to it one time. Now I think it's great. Dirty Women, All moving parts (stand still), She's Gone, and The silly - but good; Rock and Roll Doctor. These are all songs that are worth having in your Sabbath collection. The production is a little coked up - if you get my drift. Kind of like Sabotage. I can look past that. The songs I didn't mention are more or less filler material. Some people might like them. I say buy this album and add to their already large sums of loot."
5,5 stars too much?,"I must admit that I was hesitant to give this album 5 stars. But don't get me wrong it's a great CD, and better than 95% of everything out there. It's kind of funny though. This album is extremely hard to find unless you order off the internet. Especially in Canada, where I had to get it imported from the UK. It's almost an underground album for one of the biggest heavy metal bands. Dirty Women is a classic and the best song, but the whole album is great, at it's worst parts it is still good. The whole album flows very well and has very unique entrances, like ""Gypsy"". If you are discouraged by the low sales rank or the fact there are only 2 reviewers (at the time of this writing) don't be. It is a great buy, and I bet your friends wont have it. If you are a Sabbath fan with an open mind, be sure to pick this one up."
4,Technical Ecstasy,"An awesome classic hard rock album, typical of the Black Sabbath structure with a touch funck rock in Rock & Roll Doctor. A classic album for the fans"
5,"I dont know why,but..............................","I have been a Sabbath fan for a long time ,Im 48 years old so I have heard them all,and I wont begin to tell you that this album is as good as Master of Reality,or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath which I consider their best,however when Im in the mood for some Sabbath to throw in the cd player especially the car,I seem to pick this cd more than any other ,there is something that I just really love about this cd and it is definately one of my favorites and I dont skip any songs its good from beginning to end,and just to add YOU WONT CHANGE ME is probably my favorite Sabbath tune ever............."
3,Here's where things begin to go awry...,"Not Black Sabbath's finest hour, but as a stand alone album it is not bad. People tend to deride it because it doesn't live up to the standard that the band set with their previous work. Having said that, anyone beginning to listen to Black Sabbath should leave this purchase until they've listened to all that went before. If you think all the previous albums are 5-star material, you'll at least find this one interesting..."
3,Very odd album!,"This was actually my introduction to Sabbath. I didn't think too much of it at first,but certain songs grew on me. There are too much synthesizers but about half of the album is very good. My favorite songs are ""All Moving Parts"",""Back Street Kids"", and ""Rock-n-Roll Doctor"". Ozzy sounds great throughout the entire album! This is much better than any of their eighties albums."
4,Very different from earlier black sabbath CD's,"A very good CD. Dirty Women is by far the best song on the album , It's Alright being a close second with vocals by drummer Bill Ward. Different from their earlier days."
3,Not as bad as you might think,"This album, as most Black Sabbath fans will tell you, is quite possibly the worst of the Ozzy era. And, yet, it's not nearly as bad as I'd read it was. Back Street Kids and Dirty Women are very good, and most of the other songs are at least somewhat listenable. However, if you're not a hardcore Sabbath fan, I don't recommend you get it."
2,Very Dissappointing,"This album has received a barrage of a negative reviews, and deservedly so: it's a very mediocre album. From the get go it fails to impress, lacking any of the mystique and power from previous classics. It really was a step back from the awesome Sabotage and miles away from Paranoid and Masters of Reality. There are a couple of decent songs, namely the ballads, ""it's alright"" and ""she's gone"". The other so called rock songs, ""gypsy"", ""backstreet kids"" and ""rock'n'roll doctor""are boring, contrived and contain recycled sabbath riffs. ozzy has never sounded so lack lustre. One redeeming note: the album ends with the brilliant ""dirty women"", by far the best song on the album. It certainly ranks with the best of Sabbath. If only the rest of the album were as good."
3,This album deserves more respect,"O.K., so TE is not one of the classic Sabbath albums, but it doesn't suck either. Yeah, much of the focus of the 1970-75 peak years is gone, but the bruising still remains. I don't know how everyone can ignore ""You Won't Change Me"" in their reviews, it is devastation at it's best! Clearly the band was at an emotional low point when recording this one, but it helps to add to the aura of disparity and helplessness acheived here. I'm not crazy about ""It's Alright"" or ""She's Gone"" either, but there is enough solid material here to rescue it from the pits. I would put TE in the same category as, dare I say, Volume 4."
2,"It's unfortunate, but it foreshadows Never Say Die too well","Sadly, 1976 was an unkind year for Black Sabbath. The rift between traditionalist Ozzy Osbourne and the more experimental Tony Iommi had begun to overshadow the band's efforts in the studio, and Technical Ecstacy shows that internal strife was unraveling the Sabbath weave.This album is nearly as uneven as it gets--songs such as ""You Won't Change Me"" and ""All Moving Parts Stand Still"" are sandwiched around bombs like ""Gypsy"" and ""It's Alright,"" which was, ironically, sung rather well by drummer Bill Ward. Too keep it short, Technical Ecstacy was the death knell for Ozzy-era Sabbath. The follow-up, Never Say Die, ended up being the funeral march."
2,The weakest Black Sabbath/Ozzy album,"I think it's quite a fact that this album was by far the weakest album of Black Sabbath with Ozzy. The best song is ""Rock'n'Roll Doctor"", and ""Dirty Women"" is quite good, too. Forget about the rest of the songs, you'll miss nothing. This is an album for the fanatic Black Sabbath/Ozzy fans who wants to complete their collection (they should buy this album after they bought all the others)."
2,The decline of the Sabbathian Empire,"Sabbath from hero to zero. The only song that is listenable is ""Rock'n Roll Doctor"". There is no direction in their music..."
2,The worst album with Ozzy,Only dirty women is a below average song. All the other songs are bad. I cant believe the bad transforming a band can take . From Gods on their previous albums here they present a terrible face. I recommend this album to nobody -> only for people who are strict collectors of Black Sabbath music
4,"Hate Black Sabbath, but love Side Two of this LP","Graduated High School in 1976. My older brother had a few Black Sabbath LP, all of which I hated ... except for Side Two of Technical Ecstasy. (That's the last four cuts for those of you who've never owned a vinyl record.) So maybe that proves this is not 'classic' Black Sabbath for the purists (can there be Black Sabbath purists???), 'cause I don't like anything else they do, and think Ozzy is a freak, but I still like Side Two."
3,Only my opinion; put it in the pot and stir it around...,"I think of myself as a pretty big Sabbath fan, but not HUGE. I dig this album and although it may not be as ""classic"" as the other albums, it's a good departure. I'm the Sabbath fan that loves the songs Changes and Laguna Sunrise. So if you're an open minded Sabbath fan, I think this is a good album to add to the collection. Then again, it's 2007 and I am writing a review on an album that is probably 20 years old, so you may already own it!!"
3,A BAD Sabbath album is BETTER than MOST other albums.....,"First of all, I am Sabbath fan. A TRUE Sabbath fan!! Back Street Kids and Rock N' Roll Doctor are fine. It's allright kind of ... but if you cut on the radio now and days you can hear a lot WORSE! Gypsy had its moments and She's Gone was a soothing ballad."
3,The weakest Ozzy-era album.,"Still has quite a few good tracks, though. It shows you how awesome Sabbath was with Ozzy. This is their absolute worst album, and it's still good."
3,Not bad.,"This Sabbath album is sometimes called disappointing. It's certainly an unusual one for them, but it still rocks pretty well. Even drummer Bill Ward sings lead on the mellow ""It's All Right"".About half the album has good stuff. The other half,while not great, is not at all terrible. If you buy it,just don't expect the best ever Sabbath release."
4,So you want to be a Gypsy,"Technical Ecstasy is just what the title says. Sabbath experimenting, and I think they pull it off pretty good. Yes this probably is my least fav Sabbath record but that does not say much because I like all their records. I would not recommend this as an intro to sabbath. If your new to Sabbath get Master of reality or Sabotage because their first 2 records although are awesome are played on the radio alot. But overall it is still a great record."
3,Not for Saltwater,"These are not galvanized and neither is the hardware so they will not last in Saltwater. They also should of placed some drainholes in the support beams. Some stripped out screw holes to top it off. For the price they could of done better as the basic design is good, but the bottom line got the better of them."
4,This Album has Grown on Me Through the Years,"After 8 or so years, I decided to edit my original review... something I've not done before. In retrospect, I was too harsh on this album in my first review. I think I was thoroughly depressed about Neal Morse leaving the band and consequently, I didn't give this record a fair shake. Years later, and based on the merits of the remaining band members, I've grown to appreciate this material. I still prefer the Beard with Neal, but this is a very good record without him.I apologize if I influenced anyone negatively concerning the music on this album. This is a better effort than I first gave it credit for. While not in the same category as its predecessors Snow and V, it's a worthwhile addition to your collection if you're a Spock's Beard fan."
1,Terrible! A complete waste of time & money!,"If you liked the Beard of old avoid buying this at all costs. With the departure of Neal Morse, the beard are no longer the undisputed kings of progressive rock; they're not even a progressive band any more. They tried. They really did, and you can tell, but its obvious that while the remaining members are quite talented and know how to play their instruments, they are unable to write a decent song between them. This music is a sad shadow of a once great band.If you've never heard the original Spock's Beard this disc will probably not bother you, but if you were a fan of their previous work it may scar you for life. If you need to have a fix of new Beard music, go and buy Neal's new disc 'Testimony', that is, if you can find it in yourself to ignore the obnoxiously christian lyrics.The Beard is dead."
3,Better Without Neal Morse,"Neal Morse was the brain of this band for about 10 years. I did not like this band until he left. With Feel Euporia, Spock's Beard takes on a new harder edged and less wimpy sound without Morse. The writing improves on subsequent releases but this disc is still very enjoyable and a step in the right direction."
3,"Enjoyable listen, a bit overblown","First off, I don't own any other records by this band, so I'm not going to go into the whole previous lineup versus Spock's Beard now thing.What I can say is that for a first time listener this is an enjoyable record, but a bit overblown. I know with prog. rock that kind of comes with the territory, but there have been plenty of bands (Rush, Yes, King Crimson) that have been able to make indulgent musical styles work. Beard doesn't quite pull it off.The whining keyboard sound is really out-dated and pretentious, as are the various keyboard runs throughout the album.And the lyrics don't really match the scope of the music. You have this cosmic prog. sound going for ten minutes building up a song and then this guy starts singing about a break-up or something. It just doesn't fit.Still, some of the tracks are good repeated listens, and this is obviously a very talented band."
4,Great Album.,"Ok, so I may not have a long history of listening to this band and Feel Euphoria is my first Spock's Beard CD, but let me say this. This is a great album. It has many influences and at points reminds me of other great progressive bands, like the Genesis of old. It's a shame there are not more bands turning out great music in a similar vain. If you like prog-rock you should love this CD. I do, and I'll be buying more by SB soon !"
2,"Like ""V"" and ""Snow""? You may not like this one.","If you're like me, you really like (most of) ""V"" and ""Snow"", as well as Transatlantic (although you prefer SMPTe to B.A.F.), and you think about half of every Flower Kings album is brilliant (and the rest ""okay"").On the same page? Ok. Good.I can't recommend this album. Wanted to like it. Can't. So much of it collapses into hard-rock cliches or limp ballads. The other 2-3 star reviews on this page are spot-on.These guys are cracker-jack musicians... no one's doubting that. And Nick D'Virgilio is a more than competent lead vocalist (as he demonstrated on ""Snow"").But the songwriting just isn't there. Not enough hummable moments...and I like humming Allan Holdsworth, so what does THAT tell you?That said, I'm curious to see what the next album brings."
2,"Dissapointing, unfortunately...","The clever arrangements and lush harmonies of Neal Morse aregone, and with the exception of ""East of Eden, West of Memphis""which manages to raise the rating to two stars I must sayI wish they had waited a bit longer to put out a new record, and tried to focus more on the material."
2,Nice Try,"I am a huge fan of Nick and his work, but this just isn't a ""Spock's Beard"" cd. If you are a fan of any other SB cds, I would steer clear of this one."
2,I'll make this easy for you,"I have one thing to say about this CD : ""NEAL MORSE, PLEASE COME BACK!!!!!""I am trying my hardest to get in to this CD, so far it is not working. I'll give them one more chance on their next outing. Don't get me wrong, I love Spock's Beard - maybe if you are a total hardcore Beard fan, you'll like this - some songs are ""OK""....but you'll have to admit where the REAL talent went.As for me, I'm still listening - still trying to like it...hopefully the Beard will prove me wrong on their next outing...."
2,Neal or Spocks Beard,"Feel Euphoria isn't a disaster, by the same token, it isn't Spock's Beard either. The only song on it that impressed me was Ghosts of Autumn. It is very difficult to write a good love song, and Shining Star is no exception. The epic ""A Guy Named Sid"" is OK, but not something I would want to listen to over and over again. ""Otmotopia"", the opening track sounds like a song by the Foo Fighters.Given time the remaining members of Spock's Beard may put out a great CD, but not today.Now Neal is raising the bar in music for the Christian market. If you like the way Spock's Beard sounded music wise, and don't care if the lyrics are over the top Christian, get ""Testimony"" by Neal Morse. The music samples I've heard from Testimony are 100% authentic Spock's music. I fear the lyrics are not."
3,Disappointed to say the least,"Spock's Beard at one time were known as the kings of progressive rock. In my opinion, deservedly so. ""Feel Euphoria"" doesn't live up to that, or even come close for that matter. Some songs on the cd resemble what Deep Purple would sound like if they went synth pop. Others sound like Ryo Okumoto's solo work. There are only 3 songs I would consider even half way progressive: ""The Bottom Line,"" Part 6 of ""A Guy Named Sid"" (titled ""Change""), and ""Carry On."" With the departure of Neal Morse, a more appropriate name for the band would be ""Spock's Clean Shaven Chin."" I only hope there are plans in the works for Neal to appear on another Transatlantic project."
1,This album blows chunks!!,"After being a being a fan of a couple previous Spock's Beard releases, I had some hopes of this one being their best. WRONG!Not only isn't this album their best but it's one of the lamest albums I've ever heard! Prog or not! I'd rather listen to Shakira or Britney Spears and imagine them shaking their booty than listen to this weak rubbish. Obviously when Neal left the band he took the talent with him. Neal's bible thumping will leave many cold/ashamed/or irriated but at least he can write a good tune. Too bad the new Spock's Beard can't. Don't buy this crappola, I'm sorry I did. I think I'll sell it for a dollar and rent a cheap video. Anything is better than sitting through this wasted, weak attempt at ""progressive"" music. The band better get day jobs soon cause this album it a total clunker. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
5,IT LOOKS GREAT from Keegan Wolfe,By what I have read this game is awesome. It has 15 3D images to look with 3D Glasses. I have seen the film and it is quite good so I think this game will be great. The pictures look like it is fun to fight with and will take a while to complete which is a great challenge!
4,Good Authentic battery,"Good battery, fits the x61tablet perfectly. I had hoped for a little bit longer life (get just shy of around 2hrs depending on a variety of factors) But it seems to be great quality."
4,"Decent, not awesome","First, it would be important for me to note that I already have an 8-cell tablet battery for my Lenovo x60 tablet, so it wouldn't be fair for me to criticize the battery life too much. The battery life on the 4-cell is ok, not great. Really easy to install, just take out your existing battery and click this one into place. I bought this battery because my 8-cell battery protruded from the back of my tablet and made it to long to fit into my Timbuk2 Commuter bag. The 4-cell makes it fit perfectly. As I use this for school and studying, I am normally not far from an outlet on campus and without the battery I can get a little over 2 hours using wifi with a brighter screen. I really hate using a dim screen, so I sacrifice battery life for visual comfort. Lenovo makes a great product, nice and lightweight. Wish the battery lasted a little longer on the 4-cell, but it isn't the end of the world, just bring a backup if you are going to be away from an outlet for a while."
3,Smooth Jazzy Grooves,When first listening to this CD I thought back to the 70's. The beat reminds me so much of when I was a younster. Really gets you up and grovin'.
1,Awful toy box,"We are now on our 3rd toy box. The 1st one that came was missing one of the panels. After getting it replaced, the hinge on the 2nd one busted less than 2 months after we put it together. We are now on our 3rd one and I am doubtful that it will last. Had I known this, I would never have bought this toy box in the first place. Awful, awful, awful! Steer clear of this brand of toy box."
1,Junk,"Poorly manufactured-directions are terrible, not worth the money. The panels did not line up. The holes that were designed to be used did not fit, had to make our own"
3,Not what I expected,"Super easy to put together, but not exactly what I had in mind. I think for the price it should be made with better quality wood or should I say real wood and not press board. I also found it be smaller than what I had pictured...but I should have paid more attention to the measurements. I was relieved to find that the previous reviews were correct about small fingers not being able to get pinched. No chance!! All in all its a cute toy chest but Im not sure how long it will last, the sides and front are pretty thin."
2,Lipper.,Goes together like a piece of junk. Can see holes through bottom. Wouldn't buy another or anything from Lipper Inter.
4,Nice toy chest,"We bought this for our almost 1 year old son. I like the size and storage capacity. It is nice looking, and good enough quality for the money. It has the no-slam lid to prevent little fingers from getting crushed, and air holes on the back side for any children who might decide to climb in and close the lid. My husband said it was easy to assemble, except that the pre-drilled holes for attaching the lid were off line ever so slightly, so the lid is not perfectly square on the toy chest when it is closed. It still closes just fine, and functions for what we need. You have to look pretty closely to see that the lid is not perfectly square on the chest. It's also sturdy enough to use as a bench seat. The frame is made of actual hard wood, but the front, back, and side panels are not real wood. Our son hasn't destructed it yet, and as long as he doesn't kick in the front or sides when he's older, I think it will last just fine."
3,Gets the job done,"This is a decent mid-sized toy chest. Nothing special. You get a little storage for a little money. The safety hinges work well. Mine has a slightly warped top that doesn't sit completely flat when closed. The vent holes (for hide-and-seek) on the back are silly, since there's a long cut-out under the lid to help kids avoid pinched fingers, which in itself is a nice feature. Overall, if you need some extra storage in a child's room and aren't looking to win any interior design competitions, this chest will suit you fine."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This product is impossible to screw together with provided tools. It will leave you frustrated and you will not complete building it!Screws are too soft, the screwdriver tool doesn't fit well in a screw - there is no end result!Imagine returning this item - you don't want to have to go through with this."
2,"Poorly constructed, with bad music and loud cellophane","I purchased this toy because I was interested in a crib toy that didn't make noise. Much to my disappointment, the entire toy was filled with loud cellophane, rather than just a panel or two. Rolling up against any part of the toy would wake my daughter up. We thought the musical feature was unnecessary, had crappy music, and was difficult for the baby to find anyway--and just made another loud noise. The critters on the colored side are also poorly sewn and poorly adhered to the bumper. I had high hopes for this crib toy, hoping it would be something quiet that my daughter could enjoy before sleep and when waking up, but I was disappointed."
4,Vampire the masquerade: redemption,"a classic that helped pave the way for mmorpgs' back in the day. still alot of fun although the graphics are good, the AI pales in comparison to current day titles. 4/5"
3,"Good Easel, crappy design","Excellent easel for the money, but my big problem is the latch that holds the paint box closed when folded up arrived busted. It the piece wasn't glued on, it would be a simple fix.But its really an awesome box for the money."
4,Nice product,"I really enjoy the easel, It is perfect for several types of canvas.I hope to take it with my on trips, and capture some stuff in real time.For works above a certain size it is not practical, but I still have itnear bye filled with paints and brushes. Very handy for an artist withouta studio space. Mine is on my back deck, which was starting to look like aPollack before I got a tarp."
4,Sweet!,I really needed an easel and bought this one because of the urging of a friend of mine. So far the easel has been great. My only qualm is that you have to set up the legs perfectly and be very careful tightening the moving parts down. It get a little wobbly when you don't. Other than that minor annoyance this easel has performed very well.
4,french style easel - exactly what I expected,"This easel is functional and durable. The wood is a bit on the soft side (if you want to nitpick - for a student grade, it's excellent). It's stood up to heavy use for almost a month, and I expect it to last up to five years. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it. Some easels of this type come with paints, this one didn't, which if you already have paints is a money saver. It comes with a wooden palette which I threw away. Generally good, as expected, student grade easel. It's great for your high school or college art student, of which I'm the latter."
5,great easel,great easel and great price. would reccommend to anyone. just as good as the expensive ones!
3,French Style Sketch box Easel,"The dimensions of the box are good, along with the price (very inexpensive): however, the compressed wood and smell are a convincing argument for buying a slightly more expensive Art easel from another company. If you are looking for something functional and cheap, this is it; if you also want it to last, you might want to look somewhere else."
5,Great documentary trashy film,"If you want to see interviews with well known pornstars and learn about this taboo business, this documentary is for you. This documentary shows alot of behind the scenes interviews. Very interesting, you kind of get to see a 'real' side of adult film actors and actresses. Featuring Belladonna who was on Primetime with Diane Sawyer in 2003 saying how horrible her job was. Neat to see an update on how she is doing today. If you're intrigued by this lifestyle and industry, this is for you. If you feel very strongly that adult films are wrong and offend you do not view.An inside look on a vile business."
5,"A Compelling, Haunting Tale from Ward Kelley","DIVINE MURDER draws the reader ever deeper into aspellbinding web of mystery. It is sheer escapism yet with a disturbingplausiblility and philosophical logic underpinning each strange twist of thetale. The two central characters are well-developed, especially Zoe, who is astrong and resourceful woman, always one jump ahead of her husband inunravelling the truth behind everything that happens on her journey with him.I thoroughly recommend this compelling story concerning the divine, thediabolical and the struggles of two mortals to discover their momentousdestiny."
4,"enjoyable read, good source of vocab","Enjoyable book, if not always 100% accurate. Colorful look at local flavors of Appalachian expressions and speech patterns. Not just a dictionary - the author gets into situational storytelling to help give context."
5,Grandson loved it!,This product is very well made. I bought it for my grandsom to cuddle with. He was very impressed!! I would recommend.
4,All about me Growing up with Turner syndrome and Nonverbal,I think this book was wonderful. It seems to be geared toward children around the ages of 7-12. It's something that I look forward to reading to my daughter with Turner Syndrome. I also think this is a good book for a Turner syndrome girl to share with her friends.
5,Red Line Heavy Shockproof gear oil,"I had my 1000 mile initial service at the Harley Dealership on my 2010 Ultra. I told them I wanted only the best oils. In a quite voice they told me that I wanted to use Red Line Heavy Shockproof Gear oil in the tranny. I did, and I actually noticed a smoother shifting transmission over the syn Harley stuff. GREAT PRODUCT! Highly recommended."
5,"Not one to give 5 stars, but.......","This is some excellent stuff. Shifting is much smoother, decreases transmission noise greatly AND now, I can actually find neutral, every time!!!Give it a try and promise you'll be hooked.Besides, 20w-50 has no business being in a transmission!"
3,indifferent,"i bought the red line heavy shockproof gear oil a month ago for my 09 fatboy. at first it was dramatically different; the clunk into first was all but gone. i have since put about a 1000mls on, and the clunk has returned. don't notice much difference than the stock oil that was in it. good price for it though."
4,It's a great game...,"I went terribly sad when i discovered that the company who made this game went bankruptcy, 'cause it was supposed to be a trilogy. But, anyway, it's a great game with lots and lots of lovecraftian elements on it. The game has a feel to it, a lovecraftian feel. I recommend it..."
4,"beautiful, quirky, amazing","a VERY different acoustic guitar album, with Fripp's trademark polyrhythms and strangeness. My personal favorite is ""Asturias""(not to be confused with the famous Albeniz piece of the same name), which is posetively entrancing."
4,Robert Fripp: Show of Hands,Intriguing guitar work keeps it interesting. Different and beautiful vocalest makes this a unique record.
2,It would be decent without the...voice,The acoustic guitar playing is not bad at all on this CD. But the female's voice is absolutely terrible and I just can't recommend this CD simply because of her intro voice before most of the tracks. How could Robert let her on the CD?!?!?! I just don't understand it.
4,when madonna could act,"this was much better than i expected. It's filmed like a t.v. movie of the week but has a slew of a-list film actors, most of whom continue to enjoy successful careers today. Madonna does a great job as she is cast perfectly."
3,For Madonna fans,"The movie is not that great, but is always fun to see Madonna in character. Not even the music is great. God choise for a sunday morning with nothing to do :)"
1,Raucous and self-indulgent,"Probably meant to be humorous, this attempt to re-capture Damon Runyon fails on all counts. Loud and abrasive, perhaps suitable for revelers on New Year's Eve who won't mind that the story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is inaudible, and the acting is inept. Certainly NOT recommended."
3,strike a pose,"I was once a huge Madonna fan (still love her) and that's how I got turned on to this movie. Madonna's role in ""Bloodhounds of Broadway"" sorta reminds me of her Breathless Mahoney character in her next movie. The film includes an all-start cast (Randy Quaid, Matt Dillon and Rutger Hauer), as well as a duet with Madonna and Jennifer Grey. The movie first premiered to a limited engagement in 1989 and when Madonna didn't attend the premiere MTV reported that it was because she wanted to save herself the embarssment of yet another movie. Considering all of the other Thanksgiving turkeys she has made, this one is certainly not as bad as the rest. It's just very silly and somewhat over-the-top and funny in many parts. Overall it's a pretty good movie. No special features are included on the DVD."
2,you get what you pay for,The shirt did not fit well. It was too loose. I ordered a medium which is what I normally wear but this shirt was closer to fitting like a large. Also the material was flimsy so it stretched out of shape easily. I would caution any would-be buyers to think twice about buying this product - you get what you pay for!
5,pjkk333,I bought these tanks for my husband. He was looking for some good old fashioned regular tank tops not the muscle shirts that seem to be all there is in stores these days. He was thrilled that I found and purchased them. The quality is great. There were several nice colors to choose from. Just what I expected them to be!
4,Anvil Tank Tops,"These are great shirts -- good quality, long-lasting, neither baggy nor obnoxiously tight -- and I would gladly buy more of them if only they had some interesting colors. How about purple, periwinkle, gold, maroon, teal?"
2,NOT TALL NOT XXL,THIS SHIRT IS JUST FINE IF YOU ARE NOT TALL AND ORDER ATLEAST ONE SIZE LARGER THAN WHAT YOU WEAR. THE COLOR IS GOOD AND MATERIALS ARE GOOD. BUT IT IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED ON THE SITE. XXLT = XL REG
1,Anvil - Adult Heavyweight Tank Top,"Not heavyweight, not true to size (shrinks a whole size or more) and too short after washing. I wash my clothes in cold water and dry on low. It would have been nice to know that this shirt would shrink this much. It is definitely NOT heavyweight. More like medium weight. Hugo Boss ""A"" shirts are a much better shirt and value. I would order the next size up for any t shirts made of 100% cotton."
1,The Change in Anvil Tank Tops,"I purchased the Anvil tank tops because the previous reviews indicated that the length was short. Those who complained about the length apparently influenced the company to modify the tank tops. Now they are almost down to your knees. And to cut costs for the added length, the quality of the shirts are poor. They need to change their ad to read summer weight tank tops."
3,OK but too UK oriented,"Though I found many aspects of this book helpful, I thought the book was too Oriented towards Filmmakers in the UK where much of their filmmaking industry is government subsidized. An aspring filmmaker in the US will not find many parts of this book useful (film lottery, and UK legal system). But the parts that are generic to all filmmakers are what makes the book worth buying.I have discovered that the authors have recently published a US version of this book. For American filmmakers, I recommend that book instead of this UK version. Though there are some aspects that will be universal to all filmmakers, there are still huge chunks of the UK version that simply is not applicable to us Americans."
5,Beautiful ring,"Hard to believe this ring would be much, considering the price, but it was beautiful."
2,"Poor design, mediocre quality","I received this as a gift, and was looking forward to cooking up lots of pancakes or french toast at once. However, because of the design of the grease/juice wells on two corners, the griddle will not sit evenly on my gas range. I tried various positions, but gave up. If your range has square racks, avoid this.One more thing - after relatively few uses, and only using wooden spatulas, the ""nonstick"" surface began to wear and foods started sticking badly."
1,Rangtop griddle,"We found this griddle to be extremely hard to clean.....almost impossible, in fact. I'm not happy with it at all."
1,Horrible Quality,"Feel silly as this was a gift, but it is the worst made cookware I've ever used. Like everyone else said, it does not clean after the first use. Food gets permanently stuck on it's surface. Besides being a horrible product, I wonder about it's safety when used again after scrubbing."
2,"Not as good as ""Three...Extremes""","As noted in the review below, this film is not a sequel to ""Three...Extremes"". It is actually a predecessor to that film and was originally released under the title ""Three"". Unfortunately, this is a rare case where the sequel is far better than the original, as the stories and talent involved in this production just don't measure up to ""Three...Extremes"".The best of the three segments is ""Going Home"" from Hong Kong, featuring Leon Lai and Eugenia Yuan. The Thailand segment goes for cheap scares but makes no sense, while the Korean segment is instantly forgettable. It's an interesting concept, but ultimately this project just serves as a trial run for the much more accomplished ""Three...Extremes""."
2,Couldn't hold my attention,I think the title of my review says it all. The first story had me interested for a while but in the end it just failed to make any sense to me at all. After that the following stories only served to put me to sleep.
3,Hold on a minute here.....,"This is NOT a sequel to ""Three: Extremes.""This is the FIRST movie to come out bearing the THREE name. It's original title is... ""Three"". ""Three: Extremes"" is the 2nd movie. So, actually the domestic release ""Three Extremes II"" is actually the predecessor ""Three"". Got that?And the general consensus is ""Three"" is no where near as good as ""Three Extremes"". And all of these reviews you see here are not for this disc."
2,Three Extremes II: Deceptive Packaging by Lions Gate films,"Lions Gate has released another horror anthology, the predecessor to the hugely successful horror omnibus ""Three Extremes"", only they have misleadingly called the set ""Three Extremes II"". Those purchasing the discs will be given the false impression that latest release by Lions Gate is a sequel, when in fact, it is a much weaker compilation put out several years before the popular set which includes Miike's ""Box"", Park's ""Cut"" and Fruit Chan's ""Dumpling"". Amazon, by erroneously listing the names Bai Ling, Park Chan-wook and Fruit Chan on ""Three Extremes II"", have further complicated matters. The sooner they correct this mistake, and alert customers to the intentionally deceptive packaging by Lions Gate films, the better. Meanwhile, avoid this set. Furthermore, the longer version of ""Dumpling"" on the 2nd DVD of the other set is superior to the shorter one."
4,A hidden gem.,"Item in great condition.This film to me at least seems to have become almost invisible, and yet this is shakespeare on a grand hollywood scale.I recommend this film."
4,caesar video,The video arrived as promised--but i paid big bucks for that to happen! The audio of this video tape is marginal at best. That was a disappointment. Some parts I could hardly hear.
1,Cannot hear it!!,"I was unable to use this video after reading the play with my high school class because the highest volume was too low to hear. I ended up getting another video from the library, but it was not the same product. Great big, huge, jiii-normous disappointment!!"
1,Too Many Warning Signs,"I decided not to buy this item for three troubling reasons: the product is not shown, according to the product notes it is from an unknown region and may not function in the U.S., and the seller misspelled Shakespeare! We'll see if he/she reads reviews, at least..."
2,Little more than terrible,"I ordered this DVD for use in teaching the play. Though I had anticipated it for months and waited with impatience for its release, I now find I was impatient for mediocrity. The performances are disappointing, with only Richard Chamberlain as Octavious showing any passion in his performance. Indeed, Jason Robards as Brutus illustrated the poorest Shakespearean acting I've yet seen, and it's an embarassment for anyone attempting to light a fire for Shakespeare in teenagers. Robards speaks his lines as if he is reading them for the first time on his couch at home.Until Hollywood gives this another try, I recommend the BBC version of the play available with English subtitles from Ambrose Video. Of course, there is always the Brando version of the play with James Mason doing a much more credible job than Robards as Brutus."
1,Obviously someone made a home video of the the video,"The movie itself is fine. I think Charlten Heston is a fine actor. However, the quality of the film was ""abysmal"" I got ripped for 12.99 plus shipping and handling so that I could show my classes a piece of fine literary material that looked like someone had filmed the film on their video camera. I could of had better results had I used my camera phone to record this moveie. On may levels my students were disappointed as was I! My advice to English teachers everywhere is buy the Marlon Version-at least there is some good acting! I want my money back!"
1,Quality Terrible,"I ordered this tape to show to my Sophomore English classes as we read the play. The quality of the video was so poor that my colleagues and I judged the tape unwatchable. I do not recommend this tape. Instead, order the Marlon Brando edition."
2,Not High School Friendly,"this was not the movies that I had expected for my high school class, I had to order a more ""teen-friendly"" version. I think it is more suitable for junior college and university students."
1,BORING,"Excuse me, but Cleopatra was in reality, attracted to the ""younger handsome"" Marc Antony. In this picture, she is attracted to a staid and stiff lousy actor. I laughed at loud at most of the poorly done love scenes."
2,Jason Robards UGHHHH!,"Julius Caesar you might think would be a lot about Julius Caesar, alas it is not it is about Brutus. Unfortunately Brutus is played by a very poorly acting Jason Robards. Julius Caeasar is played by Sir John Gielgud and I only wish it were reversed because Robards would be gone early on and we would not have to suffer through his very poor acting.This movie is just plain hard to watch with that poor acting."
3,EARLY HESTON!!!!!,"Interesting film in which to see heston before his career officially started and to see some independent film of the time. The copyright says ""1950,1976"". Because of that, we are unfortunately not told if any changes were made from the original version. I found conflicts in the running time and have been unable so far to accurately determine the original time. More background needs to be provided on this fim."
1,Julius Caesar DVD,The is the poorest quality DVD I've ever purchased. It almost appears as if the video was being shown while someone with a camera phone was videoing the movie. The sound is gravely and distorted while the picture is grainy. I want my money back!
3,the unkindest cut of all,"This is an excellent production of Julius Caesar, barring some atrociously wooden acting by Jason Roberts, who seems to think that Shakespeare needs to be performed as if he were a bored high school student reading (clumbsily) directly from the script. What was he thinking? Oh, and of course, the makers of this DVD thought they were doing Rome a favour by assasinating the picture: formatted to fit your screen is the way they put it, like they were doing you a favour. Some day maybe DVD manufacturers will realize some DVD purchasers have widescreen TVs! And maybe Amazon will provide better information about the DVDs so we will know we are getting a DVD that's been cut down to size when we order it."
1,BOOTLEG! DO NOT BUY!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!The ""edition"" of Stuart Burge's film production of Julius Caesar available from ""Education 2000 Inc"" appears to have been ripped from a VHS tape and transferred to DVD. The video is washed out, and the audio is almost impossible to hear.Amazon should be ashamed for selling an obviously pirated item."
1,This movie is awful,"I wanted to believe this was going to be an epic classic and I could somehow appreciate the shakesperian language. The opening is SO BAD and so second rate its almost laughable. And what did they do to poor Charlton Heston? Was he supposed to look like a gray corpse? Jason Robards, I never thought of him as that bad of an actor until I saw this. It was like they tried to mix some actors with good shakespear experience with some big names, and the big names really faultered. I feel obligated to watch the rest now but the first 30 minutes is just killing me!If you liked The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur or The Robe, don't assume you will like this."
1,Terrible Quality! Caveat Emptor!,"Don't waste your money on this product. I did, and am living with the consequence. I'm also thirteen dollars poorer, with nothing to show for it other than a fuzzy, badly spliced copy of the original movie. This looks like a thirteen yr old snuck a video camera into the theater. Not only that, but the movie freezes up. The quality is so bad, it's unwatchable. I can't believe this is still even for sale here."
2,Terribly Miscast,"This is a very lifeless production of Julius Caesar. Jason Robards is monotone and Charleton Heston rants and raves without ever parting his teeth. It is Planet of the Apes in Roman togas.If anyone knows where I can find a copy of the play starring Marlon Brando, please advise."
4,THIS IS DISCIPLE! SAME BAND!,"For the guy who wrote before this, this is indeed the same band as disciple. Some of the members may be different, but the core of the group - the quiggle brothers (dave and dan) - are still there...making it the same band. These two are also the core members of the hardcore band SHOCKWAVE, who also released earlier works on belgium record label GOODLIFE RECORDINGS, which I believe also released the earlier disciple work. So yes, this is the same band. There's a lesson in hardcore history for ya."
5,ummm yeah,"ok first of all this cd is awesome!!ok to the other people who wrote a review.... THIS IS NOT THE BAND Disciple!!!! this is a different band!! its called XDiscplex A.D!! not connected to Disciple!!! 2 different bands. both are good christian bands but dont let them being christian stop you from buying them. these guys have only made the cds ""doxology"" and ""the revelation"" ok? get it right. so if you were thinking ""man i didnt really like Disciple"" dont think that anymore these guys are NOT them. listen to the samples. Xdisciplex A.D is harder then Discple"
2,Nothing spectacular,"This song by the actor Jacob Young seems like something that's been done before. And it's not really in a good homage sort of way. Young's vocals are lacking, he doesn't have much range in his voice. Musically the song is far overproduced--could have seriously done without the car/motorcycle sounds. And then the lyrics...maybe I'm used to deep lyrcists like Bono, Pat Monohan, Rob Thomas (the list goes on), but this song seemed rather inane. If Young wants to be a serious artist he needs to find a new group of songwriters and producers. Otherwise he's always going to sound one step away from an average boyband. However, he'll probably sell a bunch of alumbs/singles because the MTV TRL crowd will eat him up! Serious music fans are another story!"
2,Not worth $50,"Cute shoe, definitely comfortable, but after just a month one of wearing the velcrow (not sure if I spelled that right) straps are always coming undone. I don't know if it's just cheaply made or what. I do have to use some foot powder or something with this shoe because it does make your feet and the shoes smell..."
3,Broke in less than a year...,"I bought a pair of these for college. They are a great shoe, but... they do have a few drawbacks. Yes, as someone said, they do smell. Also, within 4 months of owning them the loop that holds the strap broke. It was easy enough to fix, but even still... having to pay to have shoes fixed that are that new seems a bit silly. Once they were fixed they were ok... but they did nothing in the way of support my feet. Simple and nice, somewhat comfortable, but basically a lot of money for a Payless quality shoe."
5,Absolutely Love these Shoes!!!!,These shoes are wonderful. The comfort of a sneaker that you can where to work with no one the wiser. I highly recommend these to any woman who wants comfort at work and away.
4,JCWTF,"Black Flash had me riveted from beginning to end. I couldn't put the book down. A very well written thriller, the description and style of writing was so vivid that I felt like I could see the action happening on the page."
5,"""A FLASH OF EXCELLENCE""","Black Flash, Wow, I couldn't put it down. A thriller! I was captured by the characters , cared for them and feared for them. I began looking behind my back! A journey to the unknown and the familiar that kept me intrigued. Did someone say a movie, absolutly. Im looking forward to Michael J. Grants next book."
5,You get what you pay for...,"I switched from a cheap, non-synthetic to this product and it did an excellent job of quieting down my power steering pump which was noisy when it was cold. Not cheap, but considering it only takes a quart or two every several years, probably worth it."
5,Francon,Excellent album. High quality sound. Really very good. Made for the jazz lovers. This music let you relax and transport to a quiet place. All the songs are good.
5,A must have!!,"I just love this CD! It's hard to pick a favorite Miles recording after Kind of Blue but this one is right at the top along with 'Round Midnight (I really like Best of Seven Steps also). The playing is so sweet by all the players, they really do seem relaxed. Not to say that this is a slow album in any way. The mood is actually quite upbeat. Relaxin' is flowing, hearfelt, poignant and sharply performed from start to finish. I just wish it was a little longer.A definite classic!"
5,"Cool, smooth Miles with Trane","The Miles Davis Quintet in the 1950s pushed jazz in a new and inventive direction. Young jazz musicians of the 90s and today still view this classic quintet as a major influence and inspiration.""Relaxin"" was recorded in 1956, and though this was created in a studio it was done in one set, much like a nightclub performance. The CD launches with If I Were A Bell, a tune shaped by Red Garland's skillful piano play, and it never lands until after the final track -- Dizzy Gillepsie's Woody N' You.The pairing of Miles and John Coltrane on tenor sax is just unbeatable, as is all of the quintet's work. Smooth, cool, a spring afternoon -- a breeze sweeping through a window. This is simply put, jazz for a healthy soul."
1,Avoid Haier products at all costs,"I bought this wine cooler and it was never right from the start. It had wiring problems, and the parts were not available. After a month of trying to get it fixed, the company shipped 2 replacements to me (over 2 more months), both of which were damaged at the factory. Four months later I still do not have a working wine cooler. I have applied for a refund, which they tell me will take another month. More junk made in China!!"
5,Corny and fabulous,"Riders in the Sky are so likeable and corny, it's easy to put aside your self-consciousness and sing right along. This DVD is lots of fun, funny, and very easygoing."
1,"If you love animals, you will hate this book.","This is a spoiler but I would have loved it if someone had written about this before I read the book. I don't know why anyone would like it. First, the heroine of the book is only 12 but we are supposed to believe that she acts like a grown woman. Second, after the third animal being killed in this book I had had it and stopped reading! I just wished I had stopped earlier. I don't mean hunting kills. I mean animals that were loved and same as pets. This author is sick."
2,I've noticed,"I've noticed with this book as well as The Perfect Sinner that the issues just don't seem to be resolved completely. I actually picked up this one thinking that the issues, Max and Maddie's, would be resolved.I was wrong. However, I would like to note that the book was a decent read just not what I was thinking.Also, why is it that Max had this complete change but he doesn't come across as to forgiving of David and the ""sins"" that David has done? One would think that finding this place of love he would be more forgiving."
5,Jazz purists can take a hike,"This is a record that requires repeated listenings to be appreciated because it refuses any compromise whatsoever. Once you let it get inside your system, it is like a drug, not unlike the effect you get from Stravinsky (though obviously not on that level), you constantly go back for more. 'Dig?' is far superior to the first 'Earthworks' release which was much more commercial though in an acceptable non-pandering way. And the more I listen to the new acoustic Earthworks project, though it is quite good, the more I appreciate 'Dig?' with it's unusual and exotic electronic percussion and space-age clang."
5,Adventurous Fusion of Musics,"In a very natural way, this band fuses different strands together into an attractive stew. This album is not entirely successful - the pseudo-pop of ""Downtown"" would be my least favorite track here - but mostly works well like a hybrid child of Horace Silver, French-African street musicians, Pat Metheny, Fred Frith, 80's-era Miles Davis, and I don't know how many other things. It's worn well over time and is worth giving a listen to."
5,The Goleman antidote,"Wow! Now this is a book about what leadership really is! Real leaders are narcissists; they have an inner drive to influence others and they like power. Now, narcissism can manifest itself into positive or negative leadership, as Maccoby explains.Successful leaders are not warm and fuzzy types; they succeed because they can take tough decisions on difficult matters, oftentimes ignoring or not listening to others. They are mission driven and will do what's necessary to get the goal done. This book flies in the face of Daniel Goleman and others who have jumped on the emotional intelligence bandwagon (claiming that the stuff of leadership is empathy and emotional intelligence). According to Maccoby this stuff is ""wishful thinking"" and not what great leadership is made of (e.g., Bill Gates is the prototype narcissist with an EQ of zero)."
4,Changing the world personality,"Maccoby used his personal and professional experience as consultant for different corporations and settings in changing the view of narcissistic leader from negative to more positive one. He emphasized the importance of the role of the personality in the workplace. The book focuses on personality types, their weaknesses, and their strengths, and how to understand those types in the work settings. Maccoby asserted that the productive narcissist has many positive characteristics that enable them to improve the quality of the work. Also, he emphasized that strategic intelligence has a major role in the success of productive narcissist. The book provided a good guide of how to work with a narcissist leaders and how to understand the four types of personality: erotic, obsessive, marketing and narcissistic."
5,The book that started it all...,"This fabulous novel came to life on film with Rosalind Russell as Mother Superior and Haley Mills playing Mary Clancy. If you find a copy of this wonderful book, hang on to it!If you enjoyed the movie, see the film! It was delightful!The basic plot:Two young girls meet on a bus to a Catholic School; St. Francis. Mischeif and mayhem follow after the two girls become friends."
5,Another great book for teachers.,"FIRST YEAR LETTERS is a great sequel to Julie Danneberg's best selling FIRST DAY JITTERS. Filled with humor, charm and wonderful illustrations this is a must for teachers, especially those who wonder if they'll ever survive that first year of teaching! I had the opportunity to hear Ms. Danneberg read FIRST YEAR LETTERS to teachers at an International Reading Association conference and they LOVED it. The line to get copies autographed went on and on...."
2,A bit dated,I'm a fan but this is very dated. Good playing but I wish he wouldn't sing and jump about. There is a lot better out there namely the Carlto n Lukather Band DVD... that's great.
5,I thought this movie was great!,"I saw this movie on HBO, and I can watch it over and over without it getting old. My favorite line is when the mother makes him eat the orange sherbet with the ""protective coating"" of ice, and he says, ""It tastes like an orange foot!"""
5,Funny Movie,"Albert Brooks does it again in this very creative comedy about a man (Brooks) moving back in with his mother (Reynolds) to explore why his relationships with women are not working out. We can all relate to his mother's offering him ice cream that is a year old from the freezer, her worries over what other people will think, his vying for his mother's attention with his grown brother, etc. Once again, Brooks' insight picks up on the quirks and insecurities that people have and dishes it up with a lot of humor. If you are an Albert Brooks fan, you will love this movie."
5,Smartly Hilarious!,"I have always been a fan of Albert Brooks. He is a subtle genius with perfectly-timed sarcasm.This film isn't fast-paced, obvious, or sexy: It is thoroughly entertaining, witty, and universal. Brooks uses dialogue (remember when actors spoke to act?) to ferry his observations.I love the perspective of a middle-aged writer who conceptualizes ""The Experiment"" during his introspective, post-divorce period. His tenacity and vulnerablity portray the nature of a writer perfectly.Debbie Reynolds is lovely and enjoyable and funny! She is, as always, elegantly sweet and ""in"" character.You may miss a few lines while laughing--you'll enjoy the second viewing all-the-more."
4,Looking in the mirror,"Almost every guy in the world will be able to relate to this movie. No, most mothers won't be as exaggerated and ridiculous as the character Debbie Reynolds plays in this hilarious Albert Brooks comedy, but the idea is the same; you love your mother, and she loves you, but the little arguments and fights you get into are inevitable as well. All of these aspects are portrayed in an extremely funny Brooks script.Brooks continues to be an underrated comic genius, and after seeing movies like this, I'm left wondering why he doesn't have a much bigger following than he does."
3,If only every neurosis were so simply cured,"Albert Brooks plays John, a 40-something science fiction writer who decides he will never be able to have a successful relationship with a woman until he figures out his relationship with the first woman in his life. So he moves into his mother's (Debbie Reynolds) house and reconstructs his old bedroom. They spend their time gently bickering over grocery shopping and the strange characters that appear in John's books, embarrassing each other in front of strangers, and exacerbating the rivalry between John and his brother. Eventually, he manages to get the beginning of a realization that Mother is also a person with a life of her own."
2,Sausalito Stuffiness,Very sexist movie done from the perspective of Albert Brooks. Tiring and dated. All About My Mother and other Pedro Almodovar movies about women and their perspective are far superior.
3,"oh, yes! they got this one right.","if, by chance, you have ever lived with your mother during a middle age divorce, this is a movie you two can watch together and chuckle at. it is not a good date movie, however. just remember: albert brooks is the brother of the guy on letterman who shoots himself out of cannons and stuff."
2,Thunderbolt as an aircraft,"The movie/DVD was not a description of the origin of the P-47, how it was employed as a fighter, the tactics employed and its opponents (FW-190, Me-109 etc) armaments, and development during WW-2. This was a feel good presentation as bomber, for which it was ill-equiped to function. No performance was given or comparisons made to other US aircraft. The P-51, P-38, the British Spitfire and Hurricane being good examples."
4,very interesting documental.,This is a very old documentary and the explanation is interesting to know how the air force and army works during the war.It is a must have in the library.
2,thunderbolt review,"the movie is not worth seeing , buying and paying any amount of money for. The pictures are grainy and lack detail, the sound is horrible. The speaker talks in a boring monotone. i would not recomend this movie to anyone."
2,add,"this is a what a sale pitch, a plane add,should say sales pitch on box, the box should say world war two sales pitch for the plane a waste of money"
4,Historial,"It was a excellent presentation of this workhorse in aviation. I was kind of skeptical about what I would view, but it truly was an excellent bit of history. It really explained a segment of our armed forces during a crucial time in history. I highly recommend this film if you really enjoy aviation history."
3,Documentary,"I gave it three stars, it may deserve four, but the film could have been digitalized to get red of all the grainess in it. As a historic piece it may deserve a higher rating, maybe 5 stars; you could get no better."
3,Thunderbolt with Jimmy Stewart,"I love seeing and watching the accounts and bravery of the men during world war 2...I was somewhat disappointed about the movie Thunderbolt....I was under the impression that this was a feature length film, starring Jimmy Stewart...On the contrary, just a narration by the actor in the beginning.....then some areial seens from a P-47..could have been better produced.............Angelo Chaloult"
4,This film has a personal family history,"The opening shots of the airfield, show a Thunderbolt named ""DOTTIE"". Dottie is my mother, and the pilot was her husband, George Lovato. The scene in the bar with a pilot playing an accordian is George. He sang and recorded a couple of records prior to the war. On October 31st, 1944, George Lovato and his plane ""Dottie"" went Missing in Action."
2,thunderbolt,"It was interesting but not much to it It looked like just old newsreel clipping from back in the forties, someone trying to pick up a few bucks , nothing wrong with that I guess......."
1,Thunderbolt,"This is a documentary, not a movie. Jimmy Stewart reads a letter at the beginning, which only lasts a few seconds. The footage presented is of very poor quality."
2,Thunderbolt,"As compared to Guadecanal, Montezuma etc I was disappointed but that might be just the way I looked at it as a former Serviceman."
2,Only the price is right!,"The only good thing about this DVD is the price! It looks like the worst kind of home-made 8 mm film shot in the forties. The color is very far from what we are used to nowadays, the focus is blurry, and generaly the picture is fuzzy, unstable and very far in quality from many other documentaries shot at the same time. The commentary is tolerable, although bombastic and tedious, but that was the trend at the time. All in all - a disappointment."
2,weak cappuccino,This is the first Douwe Egberts coffee product I am not satisfied with. It has a nice froth but it is very weak. I like coffee that has a strong coffee essence but this pod offers only a weak coffee flavor. What I had to do for a good coffee taste was to add a half teaspoon of instant coffee to the cup before starting the brew cycle. These pods need to be improved before I will buy them again.
3,"Cappuccino o.k., that's all.","CAPPUCCINO PODS NOT UP TO PAR WITH REST OF SENSEO PODS,REGULAR PODS GIVE OFF MORE FROTH ON THEIR OWN AND ARE MUCH CHEAPER!I FIND THE DARK ROAST WITH DOUBLE PODS AND HAZELNUT CREAMORA LIQUID, BEST."
2,Not worth it,"If you have a Senseo and like cappucino, you are better off buying the dark roast pods, use your own frothy warm milk- it comes out stronger like a real cappucino. This comes out weak and it's messy because it brings powder milk mixed with the coffee. The pods are too thick and you have to use the 2-cup holder for 1 cup of coffee. You can't make 2 cups at one time.Like I said, it's not worth it. Buy the Dark Roast, it's the best tasting Senseo pod and I've tried them all."
3,OK,"Each pod only makes 1/2 cup, but it is tasty and foamy. You can't double up the pods to make more per cup because only 1 pod fits in the double-pod tray.In one of the bags, 4 of the pods came apart (during shipping?), so I had to throw them away and shake off the remaining pods. So...they're not made very well.If you like cappuccino, then it might be worth trying these. If you LOVE cappuccino, then you may be disappointed in the teeny-tiny 1/2 cup you get with each pod.Here's what I do to make a large one using a 10 oz. mug:1. I make one cup of this cappuccino and pour it into the mug.2. I make a double cup using a regular, less expensive ""Podz"" brand pod (either dark coffee or one of their flavored ones) and pour it into the mug.3. Then I make another single cappuccino and pour it into the mug.Voila! I now have a large, strong, foamy cappucino! And the Podz's brand of Chocolate Cappuccino is fabulous using this method!"
5,Great Product and Service,We have a Senseo machine and love the coffees. Amazon is the best place to buy the coffees. The stores have very limited selection. Delivery is quick also.
2,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"I really like cappuccino so I was a little disappointed in the flavor of these cappuccino pods. They are not bad but I feel they could be better. I got this brand because they were cheaper than other brands. I think I will try the more expensive ones just to compare. But in reality, I probably won't purchase these again."
2,Senseo Cappuccino,"These taste like instant coffee with skim milk. I much prefer Senseo Dark Roast, with half and half, stirred while it is making. It makes an excellent cappuccino or latte. These pods taste artificial and puny."
4,"A very nice ""instant"" cappuccino","This makes a nice cappuccino. Don't compare it to your local barrista carefully preparing a $5.00 cup for you. At about .35 per cup and the convenience of pushing one button and waiting 30 seconds, this is a very nice and extremely convenient drink.I lived in Italy for a few years. I miss the real thing but once I adjusted my expectations, I really do enjoy this a lot."
1,Senseo Cappuccino,This cappuccino is awful. It has no flavor and the cream (which is actually in the pod) is all wrong.
2,not what i'd expected,"First, let me start off by saying I love the Senseo. I'm a dutch immigrant and was so happy and proud to see the Seseo appering here and, beeing abled to buy my own trusted ""Douwe Egberts"" favorite coffeebrand in my local supermaket.My husband and I are true coffee addicts and drink many cups of Seseo dark roast a day.I wasn't too crazy about the flavors already (too sweet and weak for me) but we were looking forward to trying the ""cappuchino"". Well, I'm glad we only bought one bag. We tried it and both didn't feel much for actually finishing the cup. We did brew it properly, but, as someone stated earlier, the coffee had a watery bitter taste to it and wasn't robust at all. Just a bad cup of coffee. besides, there wasn't much diffrence in frothyness as with the regular coffees, and the cream was just the same as adding some powder creamer (which I'm not fond of either). We'll be sticking with our favorite dark roast with creamer. Nothing beats it!"
1,Coffee Aftertaste,"Generally speaking, has an aftertaste that you don't find in American coffees...unpleasurable imo."
2,Senseo Cappuccino,"As a big fan of the Senseo coffee maker, I found this product very disappointing. I have to add creamer to convince myself that this is some form of cappuccino. It's time for me to bring the old espresso machine out of retirement."
1,Disappointed,The coffee flavor is hardly espresso-like. I find the taste blah. Better off adding a little heavy cream to a dark roast Senseo for a truer Cappuccino.
4,"Senseo Cappuccino Coffee Pods, 4 Pack (40 Single-Serve Pods)",Delicious frothy cappuccino but I wish it came in an 8 oz version.
3,Cream Style Coffee,This cappuccino style coffee is good if you like lots of a creamer type taste. The coffee could be a bit stronger for my taste. It is refreshing and great to have if you like to add different flavor of creamers to it. Enjoy!
4,pleasing coffee,I like the senseo cappuccino pods that go with my senseo coffee maker. It is a good way to enjoy a cappuccino without having to go out to purchase a cup. I recommend this coffee if you want a pleasing cup of coffee but it is not strong starbucks type coffee. It is more mild but still very good.
1,What a disappointment!,I've been waiting for this product for a long time... Now I'm stuck with 3.7 bags of undrinkable stuff. It tastes like a weak coffee with the cheapest powder creamer added. I got much better results by using warm milk and 2 pods of medium roast.
1,Hydrogenated Vegetable Fat??,"After enjoying the medium roast, dark roast and Colombia blend, the cappuccino sounded great! Instead, I received hard chunks of what the ingredients label as hydrogenated vegetable fat?!! GROSS!! Who needs that!? Stick with the plain coffees."
2,Where 's the taste????,If you give more than two stars you have mislead consumers. If you like weak coffee water with a little foam buy this product.
2,disaapointing,"To me this is not worth the price. A full cup with one pod is water downed and pretty tasteless. Yes, people have commented that one pod should only really make the half cup. But the dark and med. roast for me makes a full cup. I don't like things that strong. Paying as much as you are I expect to have a full cup from one pod. You can take a normal med. roast pod, make a half cup and fill the rest with your own skim milk, sugar and vanilla creamer and it tastes better. This is less pods then the dark or med. roast for the same price. So basically you are paying for bad coffee with some skim milk and sweetener."
3,Just okay,"It seems like this would be a perfect pairing with Senseo machines because they already create a nice layer of foam on top of the coffee. But the addition of ""cream"" in the pod simply seems to dilute the coffee flavor."
1,Bad Stuff,This is the the worst stuff I've ever tasted to be called coffee. If you like this you're not hard to please.
2,weak,The 1st cup was weak...so I tried doubling up with one dark roast & one cappuccino...broke the seal on the Senseo machine...now water comes out the side and not coffee.I am buying a replacement Senseo machine...since I love the dark roast. But be careful when you double up with these pods...the cappucino pods are much thicker than normal pods.
1,I can't make the coffee work!,"I have a Home Cafe maching, Black and Decker.I have tried several times, all different ways, to brew these cappuccino pods and each time was a failure.Maybe it's my machine, maybe it's the pods, but whichever, they absolutely do not work for me."
1,not good at all,I tried Senseo Cappuccino It didn't taste like Cappuccino and wasn't a very good representation of coffee. I even tried to flavor it with Cinnamon and ground chocolate and the flavor was still disappointing.
2,Not much flavor,The pods are not much different than adding flavored creamers.It has only 10 pods per pack instead of the normal 16.
3,meh.,"calling the output of these pods a ""cappuccino"" is a bit misleading. it is much closer to a latte. in reality it is just coffee with creamer. i've found this product more drinkable when mixed with 1 pod of dark roast (brewed separately).note: although this product uses the 2-pod holder, be sure to press the 1-cup button or else you'll end up with a watery mess that can only be called ""pour me down the sink""."
2,Cappuccino disappoints,"This stuff is terrible, and I have four bags of it! I love the other Senseo coffees, but they missed the boat with this. It is watery and not at all like the other types with some flavor and body. It's like drinking hot water with powered creamer. Yuck."
3,senseo coffee pods,"The pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them. By ordering the coffee through the subcription program they are a better value. The flavor is good, however, this seems to be coffee with creamer. I would not order this again as I can add my own creamer to achieve this effect. This brand of coffee has a slightly bitter after taste."
3,"Just Okay.. Had to try it, but not what I really care for.","I ordered this item knowing that the reviews were just okay. I wanted to try it none the less. I have to say, I enjoy the other coffee pods better. Making the Cappuccino was easy enough, but still not the flavor or strength I enjoy.I will stick with the other pods. Sumantra, and Espresso are probably some of my favorites."
3,"Fair product, great value","These pods have a single cup worth of coffee and a ""cup"" worth of creamer in a double-sized pod. Unlike the original release of cappucino pods, these use the two-cup pod holder and not the ""specialty"" or ""foamy"" pod holder. The directions suggest using the single cup setting, although I've used the ""specialty"" brew setting with equal results.They're not great, but they're a nice change from regular dark coffee. Good for lightening a double with a darker pod. Much better price than buying them in the stores at $5 a pack."
3,Disappointing Pods,"I don't know what I expected, but these Cappacino pods aren't it. They are coffee with creamer. I can actually do the creamer myself, so why would I get these. Also, I have to use 2 but one at a time to make one mug of coffee! What a drag. I think their Paris blend with vanilla caramel flavor is better"
5,Perfect Everytime,This is truly the best coffee I have ever had. It is the same everytime and so easy to make. I love it!!!
2,Cappuccino coffee pods,These were just awful. The cream part was caked and didn't dissolve no matter how you tried to get it to do so. It must either have some added ingredient to make it cake or it was just on the shelf too long. But whatever the reason it was a waste of money. And the taste was bitter as well.
3,"Mediocre, but...","I have the Black & Decker one cup brewer, so it might be that, but I tried the cappucino with the ""special"" adapter, plus the regular and dumped the results down the drain."
1,Waste of Money!,"This stuff is disgusting! Unfortunately,now I have almost 4 packs of it left and I don't know what to do with it. It doesn't even taste like coffee let alone cappuccino and you really only get about a quarter of a cup of cappuccino out of each pod. Don't waste your money on this, rather make your own. I really wish we didn't have to purchase such a large amount of this product."
1,too weak,When I try this the water went right though it. The coffee had harden and broke in to small pieces. No flavor.
4,senseo savior,i was not really enjoying my senseo machine but these pods have extended the life of this appliance. the pods have the right blend
4,Quick and Easy Capp,"I have become addicted to this product. It's is quick, easy, smooth and satisfying. What can I say? It beats going to Starbucks every morning when you have to have a cup of java (cappuccino)before you can breath. I can't find it in the stores, so I am so grateful for Amazon.comSenseo Cappuccino Coffee Pods, 10-Count Packages (Pack of 4)"
2,Not good!,"I have tried almost all of the Senseo flavors now, and I have to say that the Cappuccino may be the worst. The flavor is very bitter. Not that I would expect an actual cappuccino to come out of my Senseo machine, but I thought it would at least taste okay. It does have a nice, smooth texture, but I just can't enjoy the taste. Also, the pods tend to leave behind a little mess with some of the cream that leaks out and they leave a lot more water in the holder than normal pods do."
1,Really Bad Product...Ugh,"Horrid, bitter, watery waste of money. I have tried these 5 times now. I am stuck with a quantity and just keep hoping it will somehow get better. No. I am reminded each time how bad it was the time before. There just is no body at all! Colored water with no flavor.However, if you use two dark roast pods, soak them with a few drops of hot water a minutes or so before brewing, microwave some milk/cream until scalding, mix all together, you can have a reasonable cup of capp in not much time."
5,Cappuccino Made Easy,"I love Cappuccino and I've been making it for years in my little Krups steam-driven coffee maker. It's kind of a pain though. With the Philips Senseo pump-driven coffee maker, it couldn't be easier and the result is simply delicious. Oh, cleanup used to be a bigger pain than making the coffee but now that couldn't be easier either. Try it...you'll like it."
3,Best Coffee I've Drank,"Senseo coffee makers and pods produce the best European coffee I've had outside of Europe. It reduces waste because of making it cup by up, it's always hot and delicious."
1,LIKE CONSTANT BICKERING?,"If you enjoy reading dialog with an ongoing argument for over 300 pages, you'll like this book.I am a big fan of Johansen, but I wanted to tell these characters to ""go to their corners"" every step of the way. Instead of their relationship adding to the dynamic of the story, it was such a distraction that I even gave up caringwhat happened.I won't stop reading her books, but this was a big disappointment."
1,Not a must-have in hardcover,"Johansen has never been stellar at developing plausible plots, but there is plausible, even in the realm of science fiction, and stoopid. This almost rates three ""o""sSeriously, borrow it from your library. Or buy it used. Or wait until the paperback comes out and buy IT used."
1,Taking all I have to get through it,"I am currently trying to finish this book. I figure I owe it to myself to find out who the killer is, since I suffered through it. I got this from the library, so luckily I did not pay to read this. I can usually read a book in a day, two at the most, if it is good and I have the time. This one is a hard to follow, very boring story. The characters are more a brother & sister than two people trying to start a relationship. No ""sparks"" what so ever. I could really care less if they get together or not. It would probably be better if they went their separate ways. I have read a lot of this author, and I don't know what went wrong, but this is really bad."
1,Big disappointment,"I used to enjoy Iris Johansen. This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as ""psychological thriller"", but it's not. If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good. If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one. The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds. The other main character also does that. Yes,that is the basis of this book."
1,Firestorm,"I have looked forward to Iris Johansen's new book for the past year - and was sorely disappointed when I finally began to read it. For me, the characters had no depth. I couldn't stand either one of them - the only one I liked was Sam, the dog! I couldn't relate and I really got tired of Kerry sniping at Silver every chance she got and then 'I want help - I don't want help' back and forth. Not one of Iris's best. I got through (struggled) about 1/4 of the book and couldn't take it any more!"
5,She does it Again!,I'm new to Johansen and love her books. It's fresh and different from a lot of other crime/thriller. Definately worth the time.
1,Disappointed,"I normally enjoy Iris Johansen's books, but this one was a major disappointment. The biggest problem was the childish, repetitive dialogue and total lack of character development. Hope her next book has more depth and interest than this one did!"
2,The fire was put out even before it got started,"I don't know what it is with Iris Johansen lately. It seems as though her most recent books don't seem to be getting any better, and ""Firestorm"" is no different. It's getting to the point where her books are extremely predictable: the heroine has some sort of deep, dark secret that only the tall, mysterious ""stranger"" is able to get to the bottom of. Not surprisingly, those two beat the villian, go together, and live happily ever after. Not that I don't like a good ending, but a little variety is needed, don't you think. Besides, why is it every time there's a strong female character, she has to sleep with the everpresent ""stranger""? Even if there aren't really any sparks like this time around? To say the least, I was deeply disappointed."
2,Pure Drivel,"I picked up Firestorm with no anticipation. I don't read book jackets but the cover told me that Iris Johansen ""Takes you to the edge of suspense.""Unfortunately, the book looked over the edge, got scared, and ran like hell. The suspense was barely perceptible, the characters drawn from the stock-footage locker, and the plot had about as much momentum as bowling on a sandy beach.It's clear that Ms. Johansen knows how to write - she just didn't put herself out on this effort. The book should give you about as much excitement as reading this review does. Unless you're a fan of pure drivel. Then you should you love it."
2,Only Worth Reading if Your Stuck on an Airplane,"I've read rave reviews for Iris Johansen, but decided to try a 'single book' as opposed to her serials. Boy did I get a wrong number. It's like she wrote this book on a weekend after seeing the old ""Firestarter"" movie with Drew Barrymore. (By the way it's not as good and even more hokie.) This book reads like a blah movie on ""Lifetime"" network.The whole ""psychic"" stick is so badly done that they wouldn't use it on ""The Ghost Whisperer"". The characters are so two dimensional as to be non- existent. At the end I was rooting for the bad guy, hoping he'd set everyone on fire and put them all out of their misery. I found the most 'human' of all the characters to be the dog, Sam.I will assume that her mysteries are much better than this and that she was just going through a bad period when she wrote this one. The best she could do is to get all the copies of this novel and then have the biggest bonfire and roast some marshmallows."
1,Reader in CD Version Bad,"Kate Burton reading of Firestorm, was without feeling and bland. Don't bother getting the Audio version, the book is so much better. Iris Johansen ought to use one of Janet Evanoviches readers, they are great."
2,Audio - Such a disappointment,"I absolutely love Iris Johansen's books! I listened to this book on audio, and I don't know if it was the reader (who I didn't like at all) or the book itself but Carrie seemed like such a sniveling individual. Her interaction with Silver involved the same ""stay away from me"" statement in about every conversation throughout the book. Their interaction is quite repetitive and annoying. It doesn't help that the reader has a terrible southern accent for Carrie - just grates on my nerves. From the other reviews I imagine that the book is a great book - just stay away from the AUDIO version."
3,Good but annoying,"If you like books with a paranormal/suspense/mystery edge to it you would like this book.This is the first book I've read by Johansen and I too picked it up because the paranormal component intrigued me.There is an ongoing conflict between the main characters that I too found annoying...it goes on way too long...and drags the book down in my opinion.Worth reading, interesting but be prepared to skip some pages unless you like reading arguments."
2,Disappointing...,"I normally LOVE Ms. Johansen's books, however, I just couldn't ""bond"" with these characters. It wasn't the ESP-like skills I had problems with, it was that the characters just weren't REAL. They had no depth and Kerry's response to injuries and death in her own family just weren't believable. I was disappointed because I was prepared to like it as well as her others..."
1,FIRE BORE,"I admit I did not finish this tiresome novel, but how many swallows of putrid vinegar do i need to take in order to conclude that the whole jug is rotten. The characters are tedious, displaying the repetitive irritation of a retarded 3 year old in the back seat whining for ice cream and chanting for poddy time. The technology of the secret weapon is unreal, even stupid. The supposed North Korean agent has no flesh, no face, no semblance. I resent the publisher's packaging of this waste of paper to delude people into buying this bad book."
4,light weight and well built,The reason for the 4 stars was I thought from all the other reviews they would be a little bit clearer. Nikon makes top of the line stuff and I was just a little bit disappointed in the clarity compared to other models that I have. They are really light weight and well built.. Perfect for traveling.
4,1st-rate performance but caveat emptor,"With the Bolshoi version hard to find, it is appreciable to have access to an idiomatic, all-Russian recording of War and Peace. This is a first-rate, exciting performance. However, what is not made clear on the packaging of this expensive set (or on Amazon) is that this is a live recording. Some may find the uneven audibility of singers, or stage noise during ballet or crowd scenes, disappointing or distracting. Overall, too, the recording level is low. It is as well to know before buying."
2,Difficult to piece together; and definitely NOT what is in the picture,"I was excited to order a champagne stand with a bowl. There is no bowl (the bowl is pictured). The stand is cheap and difficult to piece together. Furthermore, the box it arrived in was ripped (poor packaging) and a portion of the stand was protruding through the box.The quality of this item is similar to purchasing one at Ikea. The price isn't too poor, but there are better prices to found online. Just remember, you are purchasing a few pieces of poorly packages metal here. You need to build the stand. You need to purchase the bowl separately.On the positive side, the seller (""Next Day Gourmet"") was very good. They accepted my return quickly, were professional and courteous in their emails, and left a positive impression."
2,"big, heavy and unoriginal","Trust me - if you know anything about Victorian Painting you WILL be disappointed. Nice reproductions, though predictable choices for the most part. Platitudinous text."
4,A Good Start to The Series for Me...,"I started the S.A.S.S. series with this book about a year ago, and this one was actually a really nice start. It interests you and makes you want to go to London yourself and experience what Abby did. I think that if you want to start the series, you should go with this one, and then decide for yourself if you want to continue. Great and easy-to-read books! :)"
2,Eh...,"I haven't even really gotten to far into it, because it's hard to read. The feelings of the character are very unrealistic and her personality is sketchy. I myself am going to be an exchange student, and know many others who currently are one, an this does not match any aspect of that life at all. It's a cute idea, but seems as though the author had no experience whatsoever with foreign exchange programs, or even life in London."
4,i wasnt sure when i picked this up but all in all a pleasent read,i bought this book at a thrift store and i wasnt sure about its quality but i wasnt really looking for that great of a book at a thrift store. I was surprised because it acually sparked my intrest in some parts! the love triangles and the usual teenage stuff appealed to me! this is a good book for teenage readers
2,Whew!,"This book was difficult to read at times=boring. The subject matter did not flow. Much of the text was repetitive, rambling, with a lot of irrelevant material. The author is an attorney who served in the US Army as a prosecutor in the JAG office, finding himself in the uncomfortable position of being a gay man prosecuting other gays. An awareness of this as well as the title of the book would lead the reader to assume that one would gain some increased insight into the tactics of the military in this area. Not so. Very little space is devoted to this experience.Most of the book is about Kennedy's difficulty in accepting his homosexuality, his closet and his family.Just not the book I expected to read."
2,GOOD FOR PIANIST WHO HAS RECENTLY STARTED,"- Thers not a truly well definition of the interpretation aspect of playng, and what interpretation is absed on.- He plays only with hes fingers-Pieces by chopin or others sounds all with the same color and sound...- Good explications of what the video sell'sTo get a good practice is more important to find you your own way to get the best practising, you cant be all your life pratsing as well as others did after because that was the way others get the best in their times...Good Luck !"
1,Terrible sound quality,"I love this song, but the sound quality is really bad, incredibly scratchy. Hard to believe this is the best they could do on a remastered version."
5,A perfect fix for weak teaching at the undergraduate level,"I am indebted to Hamming for having written this phenomenal text. I am currently a second semester junior, and while I have been taught all the material included within this book, I never felt that I acquired a true mastery. This book gives a very rigorous introduction to elementary material. Working through this book is a pleasure as there is no shortage of epiphanies to be had from a student who was taught math at only a very superficial level. This book serves as an excellent gateway book to more advanced upper level undergraduate math texts, just make sure to do the exercises. It is more about developing the ability to think in terms of mathematical methods rather than memorizing domain knowledge related to ""Calculus, Probability, and Statistics""."
3,Short on capacity,"I bought this bag as it was the Amazon recommended bag for the new Panasonic Lumix FZ8 camera I bought at the same time. Shortly after receipt, I took both on a 10 day vacation to Hawaii. I found the bag to work well when carrying the camera and a few basic accessories. But the bag was too small for carry additional accessories such as a small 5"" tripod and those same basic items. I ended up carrying the tripod tied to the shoulder strap where it was easy to use."
4,Mid sixe Camera Bag,"When I first purchased this camera bag, I was expecting it to be smaller (I also have a Tamrac 5230, which is much smaller). Since I use it for a SLR size digital camera, I needed more than just a pouch, but didn't want an overnight bag.As it turns out, this actually fits the bill pretty nicely. There's plenty of room for the camera, yet it fits securely. And there is room for numerous accessories, such as cords, extra battery, charger, memory cards, etc. It's too small to also hold additional lenses, and it's too big for a small point-and-shoot; it could easily carry a small camcorder though.It has three way carrying - handle, integrated, non-removable shoulder strap, and belt loops; multiple compartments in the outside zipper pocket, and movable supports in the spacious main compartment. It closes with velcro (for temporary closure only!), a clip, and a full wraparound zipper.So if the size is right for you, you'll be able to carry your gear with comfort and security."
3,"Great book, poor quality","My son loves sea creatures, especially the giant squid. I bought this for his birthday & he was so excited. Unfortunately, there is a quality issue with the binding. Within 2 days, the pages started falling out. We have many similar books that do not have this issue--I am disappointed in the quality."
3,ok melodrama,"Non Ti Scordar Di Me is an old melodramatic movie that stars the opera star Beniamino Gigli. A woman marries a lonely widowed father (Gigli) on a rebound. When the old lover enters back into her love she has to choose between responsiblity and love. The plot of the movie is generic but the music makes up for it. Gigli doesn't have much of a movie persona here, but then this was his first role. He makes up for it with his amazing tenor. The movie is in English, though the songs are in Italian and not subtitled. 2.5 rounded to 3."
3,Interesting Conclusions,"Working from the idea that Star Wars is indeed a ""new myth,"" authors Hanson and Kay offer readers a valid explanation of how George Lucas used the basic tenets of historical myth (allegory, ritual, hero, for instance) to craft stories that are universal to the human experience.Yes, it reads like a college thesis (which a portion of it was), but that does not make the conclusions less valid. What does detract from the reading is the dozens of typographical errors that abound in the book! Some serious proofreading was definitely called for here.Overall, I found it to be an interesting addition to the vast universe of Star Wars literature, fiction and nonfiction. I only wish someone had been paying attention to the spelling and punctuation errors."
2,University Student,"The essays were interesting eventhough I have read similar arguements before. I found the book helpful in forming my own arguments for a term paper.However I not only found dozens of spelling, grammer, and stylistic (for example after the sentence in bold, there is a summary in italics but not all of these are itlailized) errors. I also found at least one error dealing with the content in TPM at the bottom of p.97 and I quote ""Back on Coruscant, Sio Bibble ..."" however Sio Bibble is on Naboo and not Corusant, this is a big mistake. I found this error only doing a cursary reading so there may be more mistakes. I am a huge Star Wars fan and this simple error started to get on my nerves, it hinderd my enjoyment of the book. Hanson and Kay not only need to get a better editor, they also have to check their facts before printing and selling any book. If they were to write another book I would want to read it before paying anything for it."
5,Great Read,"This book is a unique insight into the myths behind the Star Wars movies. I consider myself an avid Star Wars follower, and this book blew me. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Stay away from this.,"Just about everything Buddy Holly did himself rates a five star from me; but this! through some nefarious deal a group called the Picks have managed to worm themselves onto classic Buddy recordings through the ""magic"" of overdubbing, and the results are not pleasant. Instead, buy ANY of the compilations that Amazon has to offer that are NOT overdubbed by the Picks, and you'll be happier. Believe me, I was burned too!"
1,Buddy Holly and the Picks,"Extremely disappointing, to say the least. Buddy, of course, is awesome but The Picks are dreadful. Too bad ""one"" is the lowest rating. If possible, I would rate this CD in the negative. By the way, my CD is in the trash. I recommend you stay away from any CD featuring The Picks.A true Buddy Holly fan,DMFD"
1,39 Golden Greats,"I have never been so disapointed in a CD, This is not just Buddy Holly but Buddy Holly and the Picks. The Picks tend to drown out Holly some tracks feature just the Picks this one is destined for the rubbish bin"
1,I need 20 Golden Greats on CD!!!!!!!,"You know!...The LP whith Buddy Holly Lives on the cover?? Put it on CD for Gods sake! The Album is # 92 on the Rolling stone 500. Why cant it be on CD??! Instead Rhino Records recommends this Garbage CD. The picks? Who are they? Where is 20 Golden Greats on CD. Geeez, they must think we're stupid!"
4,"Funny, funny, and still funnier!","This book was just ridiculously funny! This was the first book I'd read by the author and she immediately had me hooked! Tory and her friends are a riot but that Tory, (desperate, shameless thang)was a gas! LOL. The message was clear: that much desperation ain't pretty on nobody! But it was fun taking the ride with Tory. I'm glad she finally got the message and wised up. Moon was cool and refreshing and the kind of man she needed. I would've kicked Miss Thang's behind-talking about the coon schools. This was just a completely funny, relaxing read that would be perfect on the beach. You'll laugh out loud."

3,"Good stopping, plenty of noise that wasnt there B4","Even after seating the pads, and tappering down the edges, the pads are still making a buzzing noise on the rotors. oh well, will not use again."
1,Ingredients wrong??,"The listing on Amazon stated:""Ingredients: Aloe Vera, vitamin E, Grape seed oil, Tea tree oil, Fragrance.""However the bottle states:""Aloe Vera, MINERAL OIL, Extracted Plant Oils, Vit E, Isopropyl Myristate, Fragrance...Mica titanium...""I did not want to put vaseline and other petrochemicals on my face, so I requested a refund, but they charge 20% restocking plus postage...I think that the garbage is the best place for it.Lost about $5."

5,Great value,"My son, the mountain biking maniac, got these because they were cheap. Turns out they are also very well made and work just great when you need ""flats"" instead of clip-in."
2,low power in reverse,The Poulan Pro 26 hp tractor has hydrostatic transmission. There is no adjustment capability on the linkage. I had to return my tractor after taking it to an approved repairman. The tractor didn't have enough power in reverse to go up the ramp on my trailer. The tractor may be acceptable if you are mowing flat areas and/or don't anticipate going in reverse up hills. They should have designed the tractor such that the transmission linkage could be adjusted... or made sure this problem didn't exist (When the repairman called the company they were aware of others having this problem).
5,The best classical-style exposition of Riemannian Geometry.,"I bought the Russian translation of this book in 1954 and found that this is the best source of the Riemannian geometry, not only for a beginner (as I was at that time), but also for every specialist. Some items fully discussed there by L.P. Eisenhart were even rediscovered decades later --- and published another time as new results. This book is, of course, written in the old good traditional style, one will not find here, e.g., Cartan's forms, but it is really an everlasting treasure. Look also for the Continuous Groups of Transformations by the same author."
4,Good speakers,"I use these speakers as my surround and rear channel speaker so most of the time I don't noticed they are there. When I set the amp to 7-stereo or music the speakers come to life and give of rich full sound. Installation was fairly easy, the ceiling required 8' holes, then the speakers clipped onto the sheetrock with screws to secure the clips and prevent vibration. I installed the speakers into new construction, the wires were run prior to sheetrock, and the speakers were installed prior to attic insulation, the job took less than hour, but if you're running wires add several hours."
5,Living God's Will,"January 6,2004I am a 45 year old woman, who has been on a quest for positive self-motivation for the last twenty years. I have read numerous books and clippings, but was always left wondering. This book upon reading it brought an satification to my intellectual nature. Everyday I experience tough decisions, emotional battles and spirtual quests and this book along with the Bible has helped me stay focus on spirit and man, on right and wrong, and on good and bad. I thank the writer for making my way easier though the sharing of such powerful insights and compassion."
5,"Glorious, Enchanting Life-Asserting Music","I was spellbound by this wonderful music, Arnell's 3rd symphony had me singing out loud (especially in the 2nd movement). And the final movement will bring the house down. Arnell's style is traditional, tonal and ingeniously orchestrated. It has the high majesty of Elgar, the natural lyricism of Vaughan Willams and the orchestral inventiveness of Alwyn.The New Age overture is also an enchanting and creative piece, a clever English hybrid in the style of Hindemith's Matis der Maler.Arnell is an British national treasure and it's high time the world came to know his music."
5,Another wonderful composition.,"Arnell's Third Symphony, centered around WWII, is as rich and satisfying as his Second - a feat not easily achieved, given the quality of that earlier piece. It is moving and melodic, with power and emotion to spare. He should be more widely known and appreciated!The Overture is a special addition, and smooth icing on the cake."
3,Not as good as others I have seen,"I ordered this for a dinner party I was giving for a ladies group. While it was pretty good and the ladies enjoyed it, I was disappointed because it was not as good as others I have watched. I do enjoy Chonda though."
5,"The first, one of the best concert I ever see in my life","The voice of Marisa is incredible, is good for jazz, blues you can feel the heat of this great singer!"
4,Works well,"Works really well even though the case and power input look cheap. The plastic case is not the quality of a Bell or Whistler, but in several trips to Key West it picked up everything, including intruder monitoring sytems from stores. Goes off the scale when passing the radar installation at the Naval Air station in Key West."
4,"cute costume, but may be a bit too small","Overall I liked this costume very much, it's cute and also seem to be of relatively good quality. My only negative comment is regarding its size. My son is 14 months old, with an average size, and the costume fit him exactly; if he was a bit bigger I might have a problem fitting him into it. Also, the headband that comes with the costume was too small (but this can be adjusted with a little work). So I doubt it would fit an 18-month old. Other than that the costume was great, and received many compliments :)"
4,A great blues album,"This is a great blues album that transcends it's recording date: it's sound is as fantastic and pertinant as if it had been recorded last week. I don't love every song which is why I rated it a ""4"" but it absolutely is a ""must have"" album for anyone interested in the blues or trying to develop an interest. I prefer the un-orchestrated, added versions included on this re-mastered copy but everyone will have their own preference. Regardless, if you enjoy the genre you will enjoy this album."
4,old classic stuff,I BOUGHT THE ALBUM TWICE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER NOW I`M READY FOR THE SECOND CD THAT MIGHT TELL YOU SOMETHING
5,Super Session,I remember this album from when I had a vinyl record of it. The music is classic and relaxing. This remastered CD is incredible. The talent in this recording session made this truly a super session.
3,super!? yes but...,"i agree with boogaloo jeffs review,especially the last line... GET ""my labors"" {nick gravenites/mike bloomfield} this album no doubt highlights mr. bloomfields guitar work better than any other....hands down. there are a few lame studio tracks by nick alone but the other half of the record is some of the best 60s white boy blues ever recorded... along with fleetwood mac, that you will ever hear! just do it, buy it!!!"
2,Classic Jam Session,"I first bought this album when I was about 17, I'm now 52 and I love it now as much as I did then. It is one of those magical mixes that don't happen very often. Like "" Hotel California"" by The Eagles with Joe Walsh, or Santana Abraxas."
2,Guitar flatulence Remastered,"So do we really need to hear this? I guess if you are an Al Kooper fan, there is some merit, although, the Kooper kuts here were done better and more dramatically with BS&T. Bloomfield never impressed me much, so he has that NY Long Island playing style that worked in the Catskills, but came off as less than convincing outside that circuit. Stills? Please. What was the first side of this record was made stronger by virtue of the fact that Stills turned in a workmanlike effort. Sure, played hard, not much to show for it. I do suspect that this effort was the nascent arrival of an insufferable ego that would only undermine him as time wore on.Give credit to the remastering crew, though. You can hear pristinely how overwrought every note on this disc is. The 2002 remixes are a waste on top of something as thoroughly unnecessary as anything I've ever heard. Caveat emptor (that's let the buyer beware for all of you from LI)."
4,Half wonderful,"No question about it, the side with Mike Bloomfield is decidedly superior, and worth the cost of the disc all by itself. If you're not familiar with Bloomfield's playing, this is as a good place to get a small taste as any. If you like it, by all means pick up his two albums with Paul Butterfield; they're true classics."
5,Whispers from God,"...if anyone is even thinkin about picking up a guitar or is in the learning process, this album should be your dictonary, especially the Bloomfield side.. on STOP Michael makes Jimi Hendrix sound like Tiny Tim .compare STOP to Jimi;s Live Verison of STOP on his Filmore Live Concerts....chicken scrap, nuff said."
4,da bloose,I almost forgot how good this album was when I first bought it early 70ies. It is a must have if only for the Season of the Witch 2 versions on album.
4,Famous album is a treasure,I had always wanted to own a copy of this particular album. The blues and jazz rock along with incredible guitar work make this a must-have.
5,"Al Kooper, Mike Bloomfield and Stephen Stills Masterpiece","I first heard a couple of tracks of this fantastic CD on 9412.com and I knew that I had to have it in my collection. I have listened to it just about everyday and I hear something just a little bit different each time.Mike Bloomfield is an absolute guenis with the guitar on this album. Of course Al Kooper and Stephen Stills are no slouches either. Yes, this is the same Stephen Stills that went later to help form Crosby, Stills and Nash.I would recommend this Cd to anyone that is seriously thinking about starting a blues collection. A must have for the hard core blues listener."
3,Yesterdays Magic,"When I was young (a long time ago), this album was magic. Bloomfield stills excells on several tracks and his guitar playing envokes good memories. However, the playing here is mostly dated. The original Paul Butterfield albums with Mike Bloomfield however, are still high on my play lists. This album for me is mostly memorable for the Stephen Stills rework of 'Season of the Witch' which captivates after 30+ years."
3,"Stands up to the test of time, but poor remastering warrants only 3-stars","I bought the original LP in 1968, still own it, and think it holds up well to the test of time. BUT, this ""24-bit remastered CD"" sounds like somebody took sandpaper to the audio - All the dynamics and life of the original mix on the original LP are missing here! A quick extract of this CD and comparison to a 24-bit capture of the LP on my PC shows why! Heavy compression of about 6db (making it twice as loud for you non-techies) was applied to the final mix used for this ""rematered"" CD. Yes it plays LOUD, but every single dynamic has been squashed - sax wails, guitar note bending, drum rims shots! Go find somone with a copy of the LP and rip a NOT-REMASTERED CD copy of the original mix, then, and only then, may you pass judgement on the ""original"" - Peace!"
5,Best stress reliever ever - laughter!,I laughed till I cried. Her humor allows you to see just how ridiculous stress can be.
1,Dated DVD,Some of the information was valuable and slightly entertaining; however the DVD content is incredibly dated - looks like it was made 20 years ago. Overall - disappointing.
4,It's funny point of view,"Excellent DVD for realizing that we live to hurt are self, when it isn't necessary."
1,doesn't teach you how to deal with the problem,"I think most of the jokes are so over done by other comedians. I know the reason why I'm stressed, and all I wanted was to find an easier way to deal with the problem. not make my self laugh by looking at the humor of my problem. It is true that humor can calm you down, but the problem does not go away."
4,Cerebral and funky,"I, too, think the online reviewer is too uptight. Bruford's Earthworks work convincingly in several different musical languages: traditional jazz, free jazz, and a sort of world-music based fusion. No rock fusion here. That they can make these three idioms coexist and provide internal (albeit demanding) structure to each composition is a tribute to their musicianship. The real star is Django Bates--a virtuoso pianist and E flat horn player. He's up and coming, recently won the Vadpar Prize in Norway for best European jazz composer and arranger. Here's your chance to see what he's up to early on--and it'll knock your socks off."
4,Full bodied free floating flavourfull ride of an album,"I have had this one for 4-5 years and find the music challenging, I think the Amazon reviewer is way too uptight. These guys do great rhythm such that I can include this CD in the stack to play as I read for the afternoon and also in the stack when I want a party to wake up. And best of all, sipping a good scotch and listening to the music wash over me."
2,One tough cookie to swallow,"oh boy... I think the guy has some really good ideas in there somewhere but this book is not for the novice or the faint-hearted. In fact, the initiated (I've an MA) may find this off-putting. The vast majority of the main section of this book is interminably dull: a catalogue of linguistic minutae which, though put together form something incredibly profound, find my view of the wood obscured by trees.And that is my biggest problem with the book. What's the point of having something that reviewers describe as a ""milestone"" in linguistics, when you lack the ability to engage your reader to communicate it. Surely, if it is such a valuable breakthrough, Baker could have done more to make it engaging.I'm going to have to put this to one side despite it being my second attempt and come back to it later... much later!"
4,prett good introduction to linguistics,"Language has always been of interest to me. In Baker's book, Atoms of Language, he compares linguistics to chemistry looking at patterns of words, syntax and verbs to show how languages can be grouped together. If we know that languages follow certain orders, then we know they follow others as well. He examines different groups of languages such as polysnthetic languages and different basic word order types such as subject-verb-object and verb-subject-object languages, those than can make verbs out of adjectives and so forth."
4,Nice,"The players tone was brilliant and their style of playing is very 1930's Hollywood Romantic. They are extremely brilliant, of course; I just prefer the CDs I bought of Beethoven Quartets by ""The Yale Quartet"" which I highly recommend."
3,Unknown contents-CAN'T RATE IT,"Couldn't find info. in the product details shown in the catalog. I have NOT seen the tape but I did find this review from the NCAA videotape site: Coach Mike DeCicco of Notre Dame gives instruction on choosing weapons, uniforms and equipment, valid touches, foil technique, en garde position, retreat, thrust, lunge, epee and sabre techniques, parry positions and more. Time length: 15 MINUTES"
2,boring,"I was very disappointed with this game. The graphics do not hold up to the standards set forth by other baseball games, the gameplay is boring and the manegerial roles are very simplistic and unexciting. In the actual game play it is difficult to do more than flyout while hitting or hit the occasional homerun. The announcers are very boring and have limited phrases and often get things wrong. All the games are extremely low scoring because you cannot get hits. The computer catches everything, so unless you are lucky enough to hit a homerun you will sit there in boredom the whole time. I would not recommend this game unless your idea of fun is sitting around for an hour while playing a game into extra innings flying out every time you bat and either winning or losing 1-0 with maybe two or three hits the entire game."
3,Good book,"You're either a Nouwen fan or you're not. I am. I liked this book, lots of good nuggets for small group discussion, and the book could even be used in a class setting for a quarter (there's enough there).Not as good as ""The Return of the Prodigal Son"" but still worth the bucks and a read."
4,excellent reference material,"This book covers, more than any other book I have seen, the evolution of Art Nouveau. The information is broken down into different countries and influences. Unfortunately, all of the photographs are printed in black and white, frequently with poor contrast. The photos are helpful for explaining the text, but it would have been nice if someone had paid a little more attention to how they were printed.Something important to know about this book that I didn't, is that this book was written in 1955 (in Norway). The text is incredibly thorough, but when the author starts comparing the work to the work of 'today', he is referring to the 1950s. We all know that the 50's dont look like design today. This is a person who had not yet experienced many future design movements such as post-modernism. Regardless, if you are interested in the history and development of Art Nouveau/Jugenstil, this book will certainly be helpful."
5,Brain's Winter,"Brian's WinterBy Gary PaulsenHave you ever been in the cold by yourself for a long period of time? If you like chills and thrills, I would recommend this fictional book to those that like the cold. I like this book because it has scenes that make chills go up your back. Brian's Winter was written by Gary Paulsen, a dramatic author who also writes lots of other books like, My Life In Dog Years and Hatchet. You should really read this book because it is good!Brian was on an airplane that broke down and it crashed in to a forest of snow. He found lots of supplies in the forest like guns, food, and cloths. Kind of like the book Hatchet where he finds lots of stuff in the snow. He has to live in the forest during the long cold winter. WILL BRIAN SURVIVE THE COLD? Find out or it will still remain a mystery to you.By Justin Kindseth"
5,Works like a charm,"I really like this griddle. I can cook 4 big pancakes and a half dozen pieces of bacon at a the same time. Perfect for my family breakfast. I've owned this for 2 months now and used it 8 or so times. Works great, cleans easily. Overall, highly recommended.UPDATE 9/23/12:I have owned this for many months now. After dozens of uses, this is in perfect condition. I use lots of cast iron pots and pans, and for the life of me i don't understand how this one stays so nonstick without having to do ongoing seasoning. this is a great griddle and i can't recommend it highly enough. BTW, the ""customer photos"" on this griddle are mine, to give you an idea of size/capacity."
5,Like it alot,Works well on flat top range with a bridge burner. Would recommend it. Heats up evenly Fast delivery. No complaints.
4,"Good Griddle, Good Warranty","I've enjoyed using this item, but it does produce hot spots despite its claim to the contrary. I cook over a medium heat as suggested and have found that the portion of the griddle over the largest element cooks quickly while other portions cook much more slowly. I must cook pancakes over the hot spot in order to get them to brown. I do have an older stovetop so please bear that in mind. All-in-all, however, it met my expectations and I still enjoy cooking with it. The surface is very good as long as you clean it properly and avoid abuse. It is truly non-stick and quite large.As long as you don't expect perfection and are prepared to use it per instructions, you should be happy with this product."
4,Works well on flattop range,We bought this after visiting some people with one. We replaced an aluminum (non-cast) griddle that would never sit flat on our flat surface range. The Chef's Design for the flattop range really does sit flat providing wonderfully even heating across the surface. The non stick coating used on this appears to be far superior to the normal brown teflon and cleans up easily.And it really does thaw things out quickly!The only flaw (and a minor one at that) is that there is not a specific fat drain off spout on any corner.
1,does not clean,"This looks like the exact griddle we purchased at Crate and BarrelMaybe mine is defective or my idea of clean is differentI consider clean meaning no char, grease, or residue remaining. Being it's ""non-stick"", you'd think nothing would stickDespite carefully following instructions for coating prior to use, this has gotten impossible to clean after just a couple of uses.We mostly used it for pancakes and breakfast, but the grill side is even worse.It's properly oiled and I use nylon scrubbers, which now follows overnight lengthy soaking.You even smell grease, despite washing several times after useWe've maybe used it 15-20 times in the past year and I'm ready to toss it."
5,VERSATILE & DURABLE!!,"I have one of these and I have had it for so long that I cannot remember a time I DIDN'T have it!?! One of my favorite things about it is its ability to thaw frozen food twice or three times as fast as just letting things sit on the counter to thaw. I don't do very well thawing meat in the microwave so if I'm a little pressed for time, this is very helpful. It's also wonderful for pancakes, bacon, grilled cheese sandwiches, etc. A friend of mine got a new one and I kind of want one because it's prettier, but there's really nothing at all wrong with mine so I'll just keep it forever I guess! Worth the $$$."
5,Awesome product,Pancakes & grilled cheese sandwiches were never so easy to make. There aren't any 220v griddles to buy in Germany & this was a great alternative. My wife loves using it for oven cooked French Fries & Cordon Bleu. Thanks for the great product.
5,Great Product,"I have a large family of 6 and I use this griddle for pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, Cheeseburgers, warming pizza in oven, etc.I have thawed some frozen steaks once just with laying them on the pan.It is very easy to clean.I will need to order a new one, as the coating has worn somewhat, but only after years ( at least 2-3 years ) of heavy usage.Overall very, very happy with the product."
4,Good Griddle,Very good griddle. I got this griddle for camping. Nice and big!I can cook a lot of stuff at once. Fits well on my new camp stove. The reason I did not give it five stars. Is because the bottom service is flat and when cooking it dose move a little on the stove. Also the greese collection needs to be a bit bigger. So you have to empty it often and you better have a good oven mitts. This grill hold the heat!
1,Beware! Food sticks like it does to cast iron!,"If your idea of a non-stick surface is one where you need to use PAM in order to keep bacon from sticking, this griddle is for you!I own the reversible (smooth on one side, grated on the other) version of this griddle. And that is exactly what I do each time I cook anything, bacon included, on my Chef'sDesign griddle. It has the non-stick characteristics of cast iron.To be fair, it does spread heat evenly. It's just not non-stick."
3,Will it work with induction hobs?,"Strictly speaking, this is not a review, but perhaps the answer to my question will be useful for others. I have a glass-top cooker that uses induction for heating. This requires that the cookware be magnetic. Will one of you owners of the product test whether it is magnetic?"
5,An excellent griddle,My wife purchased this since we both had used electric griddles as children years ago and liked the concept of range top. We have a gas cooktop and have found it to be very easy to use and clean. We have cooked a wide variety of items and have found no flaws in it's performance. It takes up little space and heats evenly and is quite an improvement on what our families had in the 1960's.
4,Cool little (solid) griddle,"We've used it a couple times for pancakes and once for cooking chicken, and it worked great with simple clean up. It is a lot heavier than I expected. Not so sure about the handle design - I haven't tried to move it while hot, but it seems like it would be awkward with the flat handles in the corners. We tried out the defrosting capabilities as a goof, but it actually did a good job.I may not have read the item description carefully, or it may have changed, but I was expecting to get both the flat griddle surface and the bumpy grill surface. Alas, it is only the flat griddle. But that's all I need for pancakes!"
4,nail in finger prank,it looks very realistic and the fake dried up blood makes it look even more realistic. If you are ever hammering nails just put this on your hand and people will think it is real and you are hurt.
3,pretty good gag if you fake it right,"let my son use this gag on his sister, he didn't work it quite right so it fell flat. Looks fairly real."
4,A Surprising Find....,"I've never read any of Vivian Knight-James work before, so I was kind of curious about this book. I liked the characters instantly. Zackary and Caycee were very interesting characters, both having their quirks and secrets. What I found intriguing was that the James/Younger gang was written into the story. We all love outlaw stories, but when you add time travel and romance to the mix, this book is a keeper."
3,Kinda Boring,Beings as I live in Kansas..i thought this would be a great movie to own. It's an alright movie..kinda boring but mostly filmed right here in the state i love most! Check it out if you live in the Lawrence / Lecompton / Valley Falls area..you will recognize some sites!
1,Anywhere but here ...,"Kansas ... it's flat; it's monotonous; it stretches on forever; nothing ever happens; and it seems like it will never end. Of course, I'm talking about the movie, not the state! Hard to believe that any film starring the talented Matt Dillon could be a total bore, but this one is a complete waste. The script is pointless and inane; the editing is choppy; the musical score is shrill and inappropriate; the pacing is relentlessly slow. Even the cinematography, despite the natural beauty of the scenery, is lackluster. Blame it all on director David Stevens (who?) ... the man apparently had no sense of dramatic creativity during the production of this incoherent mess.The DVD also includes the Original Theatrical Trailer. But why would anyone care? Take my advice and stay away!"
5,ALL MONSTER ATTACK (aka GODZILLA'S REVENGE),"This to is a very good version of the GODZILLA SEQUAILS I still wish they will put out all the GODZILLA movies,AND REALATED GODZILLA MOVIES all in one box set."
4,WOW,"This video looks GREAT! The picture and sound are restored and look amazing - probably better than it did when it was released to theaters originally. Not my favorite movie, but it's geared towards children."
5,oldfashioncollector,"besides the music ,a concise biography is given with photos.iwould recommend this to anyone's first listening, a real bargin not available anywhere else at the price asking for."
3,MAG LITE LED,Flashlight is all that should be expected of a Mag Lite. Good flashlite but the cheapos only give you one LED Bulb meaning the replacement bulb in the battery compartment is old style cheapo bulb! Mag Lite is lame for doing this. Also the shipping amount from this provider was too much! Should've went to HOme Depot or Walmart. NOT WORTH IT
4,"It was a gift, but Maglite has a great rep",I have no doubt it's top notch. I've had my own Maglite for years and it's great. My cousin was very excited to receive it.
5,Enthralling,"This book is as enjoyable to read for the language has his characters use. (""You mendacious bollock of Satan!"" snarls one of them.) The plot was a little farfetched, but I savored every word of dialogue. The film version was perfectly cast with Michael Caine and Sir Lawrence Olivier featured. Well worth adding to your library. It's hard to put down; you get caught up in the momentum of the story."
5,Very nifty,"There's something to be said for a gadget that may not do much, but does what it does very well indeed. This is one of those gadgets. If, like me, you hate hand-labeling envelopes, the QL-500 is ideal. It makes highly-legible labels in a flash, and thanks to a simple label reel system, allows you to change label types in a jiffy. And, miracle of miracles, the software that comes with the QL-500 is actually good."
5,Awesome Label Printer! Great Price!,This little gem works wonders!!! I was printing my first label within 10 min of opening the box. No toner is used! For the price this is a must have. I give this product a 10 out of 10. Great job Brother.
3,"Pretty nice, but a couple of kinks","A very nice product in many ways. I hate writing addresses and stuff because I don't write clearly. So this is great for popping those out. They look great, it's very fast.Two problems that are somewhat annoying.1) The (Mac) version of the software uses an insane amount of CPU. If I forget and leave the app running, my CPU fan starts blowing and I wonder what is then open the resource monitor to see it's the P-touch app, doing nothing but chewing on the CPU.2) If I print more than one label at once, it very frequently jams by pulling the previous label back in too far and they become crumpled up. Luckily this is easy to work around, if I just print one at a time (even without cutting them off) it doesn't seem to happen."
4,"Works well, but not with MS Exchange Service","Works as described except there was no mention of problems using the product with MS Exchange Services and any MS Office Suite. Anything you want to print has to be cut 'n pasted to the P-Touch editor, a minor annoyance unless you rely on the Office connectivity as much as I do. Otherwise, though, it's a wonderful, reliable label printer."
5,Can't beat it,"So easy to learn to use. Versitility is incredible. I even imported a color photo - it converted it into black and white and come out clear and crisp. I purchased it for home use to label the tabs of file folders in my geneaolgy notebook sections for a more professional look. What a difference. Plenty of fonts, graphics and other extras. I am amazed what it can do. My favorite - I can print just one label instead of 30 at a time. We even made labels for a bake sale for the items we brought. They add a touch of class to however they are used."
5,Brother - You've got a friend,"I don't know how I ever lived without this machine, here to make my life more organized - quicker to type and print a label than to write one out - for sure ... cut and paste, oh yes!Thanks for making my life a lot more organized - and fun!Joy"
2,Improved software makes it fine for Mac now...,"UPDATE (June '08): There's now a better driver that finally lets me print from my regular applications (at least from FileMaker Pro; I assume it'll work with others). The P-Touch Editor interface is also improved and compatible with OS 10.5 -- so, all and all, it's moved from a 2-star label-printer for Mac to at least a 4-star. (Alas, Amazon doesn't seem to be allowing me to change the star-rating when I edit.)Originally posted, in Oct 07: Indeed the printer is fast and output is pleasing enough. HOWEVER, I discovered that Mac compatibility is limited..."
2,Horrible software--especially for international addresses,"From a hardware perspective, this label printer is great.The software, however, is horrible (0 stars would be too much).If you print a foreign address label from Outlook, which should look like thisJim DoeForeign street 11234 AB SomewhereInHollandNetherlandsP-touch will format this asJim DoeForeign street 1SomewhereInHolland, 1234 ABNo country name; and ignores the proper placement of the zip code.This should be so easy to program properly--Outook has a propery MailingAdress which takes care of the proper formatting of international addresses."
3,"Don't like manual cutter, labels more expensive than Dymo","This label printer works pretty good. The only problem I run across, if many people use the printer. Most people don't realize that they need to slide the bar to cut the label, they can't pull and tear it. Also the labels are more expensive than the Dymo printer."
3,Brother QL-500 Label Printer,Brother QL-500-It is advertised as compatible with Mac System OSX 10.4. That is not true for OSX 10.4.11. It costs me a lot of time and money to determine a work around to use this label printer. Otherwise it is a good printer.
5,Love the Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-Cut PC Label Printing System,I love the Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-Cut PC Label Printing System. The price was super. I couldn't be happier. It has resulted in marked improvement in my filing and addressing work!L S in Dundee
4,Review of Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-cut PC label Printing System,Brother P-Touch QL-500 Manual-Cut PC Label Printing SystemI purchased this simply because it was so inexpensive but have been very pleased with it. It is larger than the printer I had before (can't remember the brand)and takes a little longer to print a new label because you have to add the address to a database rather than just directly to the labeler but it is easier to load the label rolls and has much more versatility for doing different kinds of labels. I recommend it.
5,Great Product - Good Value,This is an excellent product that does what you want it to do easily and efficiently. It is well designed so that different types of labels can be removed and inserted correctly in seconds.It makes it much easier to get organized and stay organized
5,Very helpful tool,I think is very important to have a tool that save time and can help to provide accurate information when you work is done. Just perfect.
2,Not so great!,"I am a huge fan of the Lesbian Erotica series but this one is crap. The stories are not very creative, and either seem too rushed or full of extra filler crap.Plus they do not hit that point to get me aroused. Most importantly there not very interesting. Every year Best Lesbian Erotica leaves me breathless with the profound way the stories are assembled. This on is not so great, maybe the editors will get it right next year."
3,Not the best on Sol,"How do you rate a book on an artist without your subjective reaction to the art figuring in? I LIKE most of LeWitt's work. I LOVE certain pieces and genres. I love MOST of his wall paintings and drawings, I love SOME of his 3D stuff. Alot of his work, I am neutral about. This book covers it all. So, my response is luke warm. This book is in my library because of the work that I love, and I am a big enough fan of it that I want it, along with many other books on his work. There are several books and brochures on aspects of LeWitt's work. I recommend spending your money on those, FIRST. Most are out of print, but they CAN be found. Go to good bookstores with out of print books and search the internet."
2,"Track good, Tidmouth sheds are CRAP","This set is truly not up to Thomas standards. The brown track is much sturdier and better made than the blue, but it took my handy dad and my super handy husband (who can fix ANYTHING) an hour to assemble them and as soon as my son barely touched the sheds, they collapsed. We hid them and I recently pulled them out to try again. As soon as I tried to put a 3rd piece on, the 1st 2 fell apart. It is impossible to put together. We don't have the room to store such a large, fully-assembled toy - assuming we could assemble it, without welding equipment! (yes I know it's plastic - it's THAT frustrating. The bridge is fun, but the blue sides pop out if you barely nudge the track. Also, the supports are not tall enough to run another loop of track under it. That is, until my handy hubby took a razor blade and made them stackable. HIT truly needs to redesign the sheds and send a free replacement to everyone who has bought this piece of junk. Don't waste your money!"
1,trains & tracks are fine but the shed/station is horrible,"My son got this train on his 3rd birthday, he loves this so much but we spend every second to fix the station... horrible to play with, the tracks and the trains are good. I wish they build the station stronger."
3,Tidmouth Sheds is a pain.,"My son loves playing with the tracks and loves that Thomas's expression changes, but the Tidmouth Sheds is very flimsy and doesn't stay up well at all. It's a pain to put together and then falls apart within minutes."
2,Have fun with it... But Don't Touch It!,"This product is a serious disapointment. My kids wanted the Train Shed so bad to go along with their Thomas set-up. The way in which this toy is constructed makes no sense what-so-ever. It sort of 'snaps' together, but if you touch it wrong, it completely falls apart. Eventhough my kids fall within the suggested ages for the toy, it is not constucted for their use. Even when my wife or I move it, the side wall comes unsnapped and sometimes falls apart. Compared to all of the other Thomas items we have purchased... this design of this isn't even close. I paid over $100 for a toy that if my kids move falls apart. Fun for the whole family! This product is a bad way to spend your money and what's worse, it's disapointing to the kids."
2,should include super glue,"The shed falls apart every time my four-year old even tries to send a train through. It does not help that he has a younger brother who breathes on it, and the shed falls. Even though the remote train is cool, the shed falling down every two seconds is a pain."
2,Glad I only pad $15,"Amazon had this on sale for $[...] after I completed my Christmas shopping. So I went ahead and bought 3 for my son and nephews as birthday presents. Let's just say I'm glad my son loved the Thomas with remote, because this is the worst train set ever. Nearly mpossible to get the shed together without it collapsing 35 times first. Please do not attempt to put this together with your child present. IT will only make it that much more difficult since it collapses with the slightest touch. So as much as I thought I got a really great deal, it turns out it is only an OK deal to get remote control Thomas and a Harold for $[...]."
1,frustration,"My 4 year old son loves Thomas train and we have a lot of the old blue track and now some of the ""Trackmaster"" sets. When he saw these sheds at the store it was all he asked for for Christmas. I did read the reviews, but since my husband and father-in-law can build and put together anything(they have completely remodeled several houses) I didn't worry about assembly.Well, we also have had the difficulty that the others have expressed. The sheds are very difficult to assemble and they do collapse quite easily. I dread having to put it together whenever the train set comes out. It has become a joke at our house.It is so cute and we like it, but the the company needs to redesign it to be child friendly. We work hard for our money and it is frustrating to see it spent on such a poor product."
4,The falling Shed,"My kid loves this track, he used to have the blue tracks and i liked that they where compatable ... christmas morning was a great one. I helped a 3 yr old to put the track together and the tricky part was the shed but we managed to do so.the shed is very fragile and wont stay put, the roof is made from about 7 pieces that are supposed to snap together, but they just wont. i have to build the shed at least twice a day, so i ended making a smaller shed with only three pieces, that makes the shed last longer, but if he moves the track its very likely that i will need to build the shed again. Its hard for an adult to build the shed, and imposible for a 3 yr old.Besides that, its a wonderful toy that my kid loves, he doesnt build a track, he builds long roads that strech the whole room, i like that he can combine his new and old tracks."
2,Really disappointed,"We were really looking forward to giving the Tidmouth Shed to my son for Christmas. I thought he would really enjoy it. Once we opened the box and tried to put the shed together, we were disappointed. My husband and I have had a hard time trying to get all the pieces to stay together. It is awful. Once you get a few pieces in place, then another piece falls out. We are going to glue the shed together. We shouldn't have to though. I am going to write to the company and I hope others do, too. I hope the company redesigns it. I think it would be a great addition to the Trackmaster if made right.I do think that the remote contolled thomas is really cool, though. My son really enjoys contolling Thomas and watching his face change."
1,Don't torture yourself,"Too bad I bought this for lots more money at the Day Out with Thomas show in November, under a little pressure from my 5.5 year old son... anyway, the thing is absolute torture to set up. Spend your days and evenings with your face on the floor trying to fit and keep all the little pins together, with the frustrated kid next to you. The slightest touch makes the whole thing collapse. Gluing it is a good idea except who has room to store a fragile plastic curved building that measures 24 x 9 inches. The turntable is nice, the bridge is great, but the sheds are so badly designed that it is a crime. At least it comes with two little track pieces that adapt to the old blue tracks, which we have thousands of."
1,More Frustrating Than Fun,"My son is a huge Thomas fan so he was thrilled when his grandmother gave him this toy for his birthday. Unfortunately, it was difficult to assemble and the shed simply falls apart when he plays with it. The engine is fun in that it runs in reverse as well as forward, but the bridge and shed seem ridiculously flimsy to me. My son gets frustrated when it falls apart again and again. He can't fix it himself, so I don't see how it has any real educational value. The most disappointing thing is that this would be a really fun toy if it were not so poorly made."
2,More delicate than a house of cards,"Beware - if you want Tidmouth Sheds to stay built longer than thirty seconds get out the superglue - that is if you can get it together in the first place. This set can be a lot of fun for the little ones and comes with lots of pieces (Remote control Thomas, Harold the Helicopter, three way tunnel, roundhouse turntable). We recently ran out the batteries on the Thomas remote controlled engine and after fifteen minutes still cannot get into the battery compartment (the screws were tightened down hard and pretty well stripped already!). We won't be buying any more trackmaster products (though my son loves the battery operated Fearless Freddie!) and will be purchasing a wooden railway - he'd rather push the cars around the track anyhow. If like the idea of the trackmaster try a different set from this one unless you want to get out the superglue."
4,Building the shed,"My 14 year old tried to put this together at christmas with the directions and got frustrated enough I thought he was gonna explode, lol. We had just been playing with the tracks without the shed, which is fun enough for my 2 year old.I finally decided to give it a shot today. I had no directions and maybe that helped me. I actually came to amazon to see a picture. Whatever the directions say, forget it.Build it upside down. Start with the eaves, then the building ends and then door frames (with doors already in there), then put the track part on there, all upside down. You have to hold it while you're snapping the door frames in but it was easy enough. It took about 10 minutes that way.I agree though it doesnt seem to be the sturdiest design, and glue probably couldn't hurt."
2,How is a child supposed to play with it!!,"I wish I had read the reviews before!! We have lots of Tomy and now trackmaster so I figured this would be a nice addition. WRONG!!!The shed is a challenge to set up and breaks down if you so much as blow on it. I will be trying the supperglue but still. Couldn't they have just made the top one piece and have the supports click in place? It takes me 15 minutes to ""set it up"" and 1/2 minute for me to hear ""MOM can you help me, again"" from my 7 year old (and master Lego builder). This is so not woth the money!"
2,Shabby Workmanship,"We have a ton of the wooden railway and assumed since it was Thomas branded the quality would be the same. I was WRONG! My son got this for Christmas and wanted it put together quickly. We spent an hour trying to get the shed to stay together. It simply does not stay together, the clips that should hold it come loose with a mere touch and the building keeps collapsing. This is not 5 year old friendly! I would not spend the original price again to purchase this item!"
3,"Diabolically challenging to assemble, but that's where the educational value is","I dare you: try to assemble the shed in this kit all by yourself. And I'm speaking to the grownups here, because the kids who would enjoy this set the most, those of kindergarten age, simply will not be able to put it together without help. And they are the ones who will be helping their grownups, not the other way around.The train set is fun. Be aware it is not compatible with the metal Thomas trains and wooden tracks that are ""Brio-compatible."" It's a whole different series made by a different licensee. Once assembled, it's fun.But if you can engage your five or six year old in the putting together, the learning how to translate the diagrams into progressive steps toward assembly, then you will have learned a lot together."
3,Not what I expected!,"I love everything that is connected with Laura Ingalls Wilder, and was looking forward to this video. However, it was just filled with reflections and short flashbacks. I would prefer to see a movie that actually developed one of these flashbacks rather than this. I was also hoping to give the Ingalls bug to my daughter. This video doesn't allow you to watch any particular character long enough for that. I probably would have bought this eventually but only after I purchased the other available videos."
5,Little House on the Prairie,A Christmas they never forgot is my second favorite Little House on the Prairie second only to the premire movie.... A real joy to watch over and over again... The Craftsman is a joy to experience to notice over and over again...
3,A nice Shelf Filler,"This book isn't going to change your life but it's an interesting and easy read. The kind of book you can pick up and read again and again. It's funny. I liked it. A good book to give to an questioning teenager. Can cows walk down stairs is a shelf filler, but it's interesting."
5,Lots of Good Insights,"I really enjoyed listening to this CD. Hearing what different teachers had to say about the topics was really great.I liked the fact that we were learning something from everyone. This is a great CD, and contains lots of wisdom and useful information.Very easy to understand for a beginner."
5,Inspirational,I have listened to A Passion of Life many times over the years. I find it amazingly inspirational and soothing.
1,WORTHLESS!,An amalgam of snippet voices from famous and not so famous people giving one and two liners of sage advice. Disorganized and uninteresting. The worst audiopurchase I have ever made.
1,"Not Simple, Not Helpful","Simple? This is actually layman's attack on the old Solesmes method in order to advance, well, not much at all. He asserts the proposition that chant cannot be sight read by groups but rather that everyone must hang on every note of the director and mimic him. He further says that chant has no rhythm of its own. My goodness: it's a wonder anyone sings it at all! Indeed, he doesn't come anywhere close to describing how to sing a single one. He discusses some particular chants but never mentions where they fit in liturgy. He is fixated on the old St. Gall neumes to the exclusive of every advance since then -- and then wraps it all up in the garb of the Cardine school. It is really a radically unhelpful volume, and I'm keeping my rhetoric really in check here. Indeed, I feel bad for anyone who buys this book in the hope of singing chant."
5,May not get you singing but ...,"What excited me about this book when I first saw it was that it explains the old neumes - the signs over the text that bear no resemblance to our contemporary staff oriented notation. However, the greater value of this volume is the careful notes on performance that are provided for the chants. These notes are otherwise available only if you have a superb chant instructor - something many of us do not have access to. Even if you have no intestest in singing Gregorian chant, these notes teach you to listen well to chant.This is a very slim volume but it contains a large does of clear and accurate information regarding Gregorian chant."
4,An Easy Reader,"This book is very easy to read cover-to-cover. It is entertaining, and easy to understand. A couple of things got annoying. There are 4-5 pages of ""How to pack a cooler"" which will leave you wondering ""why did i just read that?"" and many many references about ""Volume 2"". Much of the information that i wanted from this book is apparently going to be published in volume 2. I will buy that one when it comes out."
3,For complete begginers,"The book is easy and fun to read. But I could not find any valuable information for someone who has already a minimum of offroading experience. Plus, the author constantly refers to his ""volume II"" for in depth coverage of important subjects. So if you are looking for serious reading, avoid this book."
3,Volume 2 should be good,If volume 2 ever comes out it will more than likely be a good book. Volume 1 comes up short. Volume 1 is 2 wheel drive.
4,Fighting Lady,"Action on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific during World War Two. Ever wondered what it would be like coming back to your floating, rather small, island, with half your airplane missing?. Sheer guts abound in this account of life aboard, and aloft from, a typical American fleet carrier. The heroism of the deck crew in throwing caution to the wind to extricate a pilot from his damaged machine, coupled with the sheer courage of pilots approaching a small deck at high speed in the middle of a rather large ocean, is always going to offer something worthwhile watching. For modellers of WW11 US Navy airplanes this is going to be worthwhile too. Enjoy."
2,Fighting Lady,"It should be clearly told to the buyer that this is a mere ""DOCUMENTARY"" not A MOVIE.... ROBERT TAYLOR STILL SOUNDS GREAT..."
5,Saw it once,"Once is enough, gave it to my father how was in the Navy, he liked it more so it is his now."
2,poor presentation,"although the movie had original war footage, it was presented and narrated very poorly. don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Nostalgic,"I remember as a kid in the 60's, receiving ""The Fighing Lady"" toy for Christmas. That started a life-long love of aircraft carriers. I know most people aren't old enough to remember Robert Taylor, but listening to his narration brought back a lot of memories. I would recommend this to anyone who is a naval history buff, or who would like to learn more about aircraft carries in WWII."
5,Great Addition To Any WW2 Library.,"Most of the footage in this documentary is original, I have not seen it in places like ""War In The Pacific"" or ""The World At War"". It is a great narrated look at live and operations in an aircraft carrier. The Great Wing Camera footage alone justifies the purchase."
5,Time Machine,"It's a truly wonderful trip into the time when the destiny of the world was being decided. These are some of the young men who fought for our right to live free. These are the men of ""the greatest generation"" as young men just then becoming great. This is the real thing - 16mm movie film clips taken on the spot. It's not a recreation or imagined story or modern movie about what happened then. It is the actual men, the actual machines and the actual happenings - as it happened while it was happening. And, although the color is faded and sometimes not true, although the narration may seem a little hokey or biased and, although if it was made with a consumer video camera today it would be technically a lot better - this movie IS 1943 and so is everything about it. Strap into the time machine and go aboard the carrier for a little while and see what these heroes were doing - as they were doing it. It's a wonderful experience."
3,For the WW fanatic,My husband enjoyed this. Me...not so much. The film is sort of blurry. Interesting from historical perspective. It portrays an aircraft carrier that must have been the latest at the time.
5,A movie theater 'short'.,I liked going to the old movie theaters where they would run 'shorts' before the feature.A true nostalgia piece and must have for the historical minded.A fine example of the long ago era of the movie house.
2,boring,This was presented as a war movie with Robert Taylor.It was a documentry and not a very good one.Unless you like documentries I would not give a thumbs up.
4,Been there,"Read the book, seen the movie and lived it for real. 'Nuff said! Needs to be updated though."
2,war drama,"this is a very good war movie of the american carrier, but disappointed in the print as it is poor clarity at the start, the color is very deep with a lot of pink showing. the sound is down in parts, but the narration id very good by Robert taylor, well directored and the score by Newman is good. I can only give this movie 2 star. it as a lovely cover annd a good story to it. however I shall look for a better copy if available in the future"
3,The Fighting Lady,"As others have written, this is a great color movie from WWII of CV-10 U.S.S. Yorktown. However, the DVD is disappointing because it is generally off-color, mostly with a distinct yellow tint. Compared to the VHS tape of this same movie that I bought at the Yorktown's museum at Patriot Point, the color is significantly worse and the detail is no better. Further, the VHS tape has a nice addendum that tells more of the story. The DVD has the Good Times disclaimer that it's from an old movie, but I'm not sure why it should be of lesser quality than a VHS tape purchased in the last few years."
3,This isn't an WWII action film but rather a WWII documentary narated by Robert Taylor,"I was somewhat surprised that this DVD turned out to be a narrated WWII documentary on WWII Aircraft Carriers focused on one they named ""The Fighting Lady"" instead of a Robert Taylor action film. A lot of the actual WWII footage is in color which was a plus.In addition, I did learn about carriers from that period as well as battle tactics. So although I was disappointed in it not being an action film, there were some good takeaways. I would recommend it to any WWII enthusiast interested in the technical aspects of WII US Aircraft Carriers as a patriotic documentary."
3,A good documentary for the folks back home,"One needs to keep in mind that this film was made in 1944 for the folks back home, so it conveys how life was on a carrier - in a general way. I was a little disappointed in picture quality - most of the scenes were captured on 16mm film. It's fairly interesting for a couple of viewings, but it's not going to be a permanent part of my collection."
2,"Sturdier launch rods are important, but this product is not the best.","Heavier model rockets and multi-stagers definitely could use the added support of a 3/16 inch diameter launch rod. However, this two-piece rod may not be the ideal solution.First, there is the high cost. A 36"" music wire rod of 3/16"" diameter costs less than $3.00 at the local hardware store.OK, the seeming convenience of a take-apart rod might make storage and transportation easier, but there are drawbacks to this Maxi-Rod in particular. The attach junction might not be perfectly plumb; any run-out between the two pieces translates to a noticeable bump at the joint. A model rocket's launch lug can snag on that edge. I have seen D-powered rockets tear the top rod segment out at take-off.The only solution is to file and sand any uneveness flush. You wouldn't have this extra hassle with a single-piece music wire.Take a pass on this product."
5,Smooth shifts,"I'm using this in a ZF S5-42 manual transmission (Ford truck, 7.3 IDI). Works great, smooth shifts, no problems. Have used it in every climate from 10 below to 120 desert heat, and the trans shifts great. This is one of the ZF approved fluids for this transmission."
3,It could have been a contender!,"This book could have filled an important niche in the FDTD literature by providing a short, readable introduction to this important computational technique. The book is almost crippled by typographical errors, particularly in the code listings at the end of each chapter. I came upon this book after having read several other books and written a number of FDTD codes from scratch, so I was able to catch most of the errors in the code listings and get them working without too much trouble. It's not clear to me whether or not a neophyte (the presumed target of this book) would be able to catch these errors as easily as I did. A tenacious reader might be able to catch most of them, given enough time and effort. With the elimination of these errors (hopefully there will be a corrected second edition), I would easily give this book a 5 star rating."
1,lousy,"i think this was giving more hype than needed and i brought this disc thinking i was in for a real treat, but sadly it was wack"
2,Beautiful but disappointing,"I was one of the first purchasers of this camera. I was excited by the small size and prospect of 4mp resolution. I also liked the slide=away lens cover which I felt would be highly protective and the metal body.It is a lovely camera but has had one flaw that makes it less than ideal for me.The problem is the focus, indoors in low light. It's fine for outdoor snaps but most of the pictures I take are indoors. Often the light is low because I am in a meeting room.In this case, the camera cannot autofocus well and, as there is no manual focus to override it, the problem is impossible to fix.I returned the camera for service, thinking perhaps it was a manufacturing defect but, sadly, it did not improve.I am now looking for another camera to replace it.It's a pity because it is a sweet, compact thing that's easy to carry. It would be a great choice for someone who is mostly interested in outdoor pictures."
1,Loses its shine after a while,"I originally loved this camera.... small, light, good battery life, hi-res photos to work with. However, after using it for the last year, and taking over 2,100 photos with it (the camera keeps track) I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with it.Unless you're outdoors in VERY bright sunlight, or using the flash, forget about taking decent photos. I've held the camera solidly against a wall to take indoor photos without flash and all you get is a streaky mess. You can't control the apeture setting, and hence EVERY photo comes out blurry unless you are in bright, direct light.I spend a good 3-4 minutes with EVERY photo that DOES come out O.K. (not blurry) touching it up in photoshop. For whatever reason, the CCD is just not getting enough photons to take good, crisp, bright photos.Too bad, too, because in most other ways its a great camera."
4,best deal best pic best price,Some negative comments in here have no merit because they came from people who do not know about electronic or computer. There was a comment that the pics didn't show up nice on the monitor is just plain ignorant. Get a better monitor!Here is my review:Pros:very high quality images (PCwold agrees)Very study builtTiny & beautifulTakes two different media cardslowest price & best valueCons:short battery lifeKey features are hidden in multi-step menu (such as video)limited features (because it's small :)Buy this if you are not a pro or advanced shooter. This is the best deal out there ! Pics quality is up there at 97 percentile!
1,Keeps erasing mulitmedia cards!,"I bought this camera and the second time I used it, took some pictures and turned it off. When I turned it back on the memory card was empty! (And this was the 16MB card that came w/the camera.) Off to the store I went and bought another card, and one by another maker thinking I'd received a bad card. My husband took the camera on a 4 day business trip and took some pictures and they were indeed retained on the card for all four days. Before he headed home(now the fifth day) he turned the camera on and once again the pictures were gone!!!"
5,Gorgeous and informitive,"I bought the book mainly to see the work of photographer Stephen Johnson, and his work truly delivered. These pictures are a must study for landscape photographers. His photographs capture a simple beauty and are a heartfelt display of the region. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the work of photographer Robert Dawson, and by the amount of information contained within the pages of ""The Great Central Valley"". If you enjoy photography or are interested in California history, you will highly enjoy this book."
3,"Historical, not contemporary, material","The book contains mostly historical material -- photos and text. I was looking for a book about contemporary Central Valley. A one-page graph shows dollar-value of products and the percentage of U.S. production. One photo, of the planting of asparagus in a dust-storm, shows mostly dust."
1,I agree with the don't get this book group,"This is a regular paperback to be read somewhere other than in front of the piano, so why bother. To have to hold this little paperback with one hand and try to practice with the other is not worth the trouble. It is much easier to just get a beginner book with a binding condusive to page turning and teach yourself. The shipping time was also not worth it - 2 or 3 months if I remember correctly??"
4,Simple,"A pamphlet disguised as a book. However, it is an effective pamphlet for what it accomplishes."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This is not an instructional book at all. It can be summarized very briefly. Play chords with the left hand, and melodies on the right. DUH! The author doesn't care how you do it, just do it! Just don't contort your hands! This is more of a motivational book but with nothing to support it, unless you count the author's numerous marketing links to his own products."
3,Play Piano in a Flash,"So far, the approach seems logical and easy to follow. I would have to say, though, the word ""Flash"" is wildly overstated. For a newbie to the keyboard it does not come quickly. Houston's approach is MUCH better than others I've tried, however. I would definitely recommend buying the book."
2,Not for people who have had lessons!,"I gave it two stars because at the very least it was easy and entertaining to read. I took lessons for 2 years when I was a kid and this book didn't teach me anything. My husband has never had lessons and didn't learn a thing from this book either. Scott Houston totally glossed over the part about learning how to read music and then went into a discussion on theory of chords. Then he spent two or three chapters discussing how easy it is to play the blues. Then he ended it with a motivational ""speech"" about his philosophy of playing non-classical piano."
1,Lots of fluff,"This book is just full of fluff IMO. If you have ever seen Scott on TV, he talks 95% of the time in a motivational way and 5% of instruction. This book might be 99% motivational text and 1% instruction. If you are new at piano, as I am, I'd like to know how I do I play chords that overlap the melody line or vice versa. I'd also like to know good fingering technique but more specifically, how do I practice playing with both hands at once and without looking? I know it is practice, but how? What are some good techniques to getting to that point? Sure I understand his technique of lead sheets with chord symbols above the melody line, but I have no clue how to practice playing both at once. This books provides no insight on these matters and find myself looking at other books that may help me in these areas. If you new to piano, I assume you must master these same issues that I have of getting started. This book does not help."
3,Okay ideas but content is thin and disappointing,"Bought this book after seeing Scott on PBS fund raiser. Had recently taken Patrick Hardman's 1-day class ""Play Instant Piano"" and was exploring other books on the topic. Scott's book and video are okay as introductions to the approach, but his content (songs and techniques) is a big disappointment: more pep talk than content, more encouragement than here's-how-you-do-it. The Dummies piano book by Blake Neely proved far more useful to me, as has also Neely's book on How to Play Piano from a Fake Book. Measured against Neely and Hardman, Scott's marketing skills are superior but unfortunately he does not deliver what these other people do: Really help you play easily and smoothly."
2,I wasn't unduly impressed.....,"Basically the book contains a single premise... that one can play the piano using simple chords with the left hand and the melody with the right. I had gained this knowledge from watching the author on a TV cable channel and was looking for further insights...I read the book very quickly in a single sitting, there are not that many pages, and many of those consisted of tips like modulating the chords to get a different presentation.What would have been nice would have been chord charts but I had to buy another book for those and a Goggle search on the web found the tricky ones not in that book.But, like another poster, I found little of substance beyond the initial premise. To me it looked like a book cobbled together to pad it out."
2,Same as Randy Milano's book.,"I seen his infomercial on PBS and decided to give this book a try. Much to my dismay the only useful information in it was the chord learning system in Milano's book I had bought years earlier. The rest is, besides the usual ""you can do it"" stuff is just basic notes on a scale that you can find anywhere on the internet. Pass."
3,I just finished reading this.,"It basically tells you to play chords with your left hand, the melody with your right, and then ignore everything else. It says to buy fake books instead of normal sheet music.It stresses that is the correct way to play pop songs and is not intended for playing classical music. It actually mocks classical music a little. It then goes in to some detail on how to improvise a bit to have fun with it. The rest of the book is a big pep talk.This is a very thin book, and the parts that matter can be read in just a couple hours. Instead of buying it, just go BN, pick up a Starbucks, find this book, read it on a chair, and then put it back. It's worth reading but maybe not worth buying. You can certainly do worse with your $13, but you can probably do better."
2,Play piano in a flash,"Easier said than done. More like a low voltage flicker than a flash. With some musical background and familiarity with a keyboard the program probably could work fairly well, but with no previous keyboard knowledge it is extremely difficult and would require many, many dedicated hours to even begin to play a piano as indicated in the book."
2,"SORRY, NOT VERY IMPRESSED",The good part is that I went and found a better book: How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons by Ward Cannel.
4,A great tool to start learning piano,"To begin with, I had zero piano experience before purchasing Scotts book and ""3-steps..."" DVD and in just 2 weeks i could play 4 songs including Elton John, Bob Dylan and the theme from ""Cheers"". Now, understand that these products are just tools you use to get started. It takes a real passion and desire to play to make them effective, but if you stick to the basics (learn the chords, learn the melody, put them together) you WILL start playing quickly.I found that the DVD had more actual instruction, where the book seemed more motivational, but hey, what's wrong with motivation if it gets the job done.Long story short, I would recommend Scotts program (book and DVD) to anybody starting out.PS... my DVD had full pause, fwd & rwd capabilities with chapters and menus. if yours didn't, its either your player or you have a bootleg copy."
5,This Play Piano in a Flash song book has everything,"This Scott Houston Play Piano in a Flash song book has everything in it for songs and I am very pleased with it. The print is a great size and is easy to follow, for a beginner this means a lot."
2,"Don't waste $ on this kind of ""Flash"" books","I learn every musical instruments (Guitar, Sax, Piano, Flute, Violin.... you name it)all by my self from the book and by watching people playing them. There is nothing can be play in a FLASH especially if you are the FIRST TIME musical instrment learner who doesn't know any other instrments. You should get a book of the Musical Theroy before you try to learn any instrument. Trust me, it will save you at least 50% of the times."
5,PIANO YAMAHA,"GREAT hit! My 10- year old loves to use it as an awesome alternative to his dear electronic games. And something to show off to his friends when they are here. He learned on his own couple of songs he likes: ""clocks"" and he plays something that I like for me. Worth the money!"
3,Sweet but too short.,"This book is helpful and concise. I don't have a lot of spare time to learn a new instrument and this book does save time. I was a bit disappointed that almost half the book is chord charts rather than (sheet)music. Since the book is not spiral bound, I am afraid to cut out he chord charts, as I fear the binding would fail. This makes the chord charts virtually useless. Additionally, it would have been nice if the author had included some practice music longer than eight bars. It made me feel like he is overly concerned that I also buy his fake book, rather than learn the piano. His teaching approach makes this book fun, easy, and effective. 3.5 stars ... could have easily been 5 with more ""meat."""
2,Not For Everyone,"He makes it look so easy, doesn't he? And yes, you can learn simple pieces in simple keys with the method, as long as you purchase some of his overpriced books and disks, but don't think that the book alone will do the trick.To get the results I wanted, I ended up buying a different method, but I don't know if I'm allowed to mention it here."
2,Very limited,"Well, the most I can say is that it will teach you a few tricks for playing chords along with a simple melody line, like found in fake books. Scott's method is adaptable to only a limited style and tempo of playing. There is a companion DVD of this book of the same title. Both the book and the DVD are overpriced for what they contain, in my opinion. A much better choice would be ""How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons"", also available from Amazon."
2,"half book hyping you up, then dissapoints with poor content","He doesnt have a system or anything. All he say is to buy a sheet music of your favorite song and play it. Only interesting part are the few pages of cool techniques of ""faking"" the chords, which are rather advanced. I think he could have done better naming this book, ""how to play a fakebook"", and develop on those techniques not just explaining them on few lines.He wants the beginner to start playing the music sheet. But you'll just get frustrated. This is for inters, but then why buy a book for only few useful pages."
5,chrome handle covers...Great!,I just wanted to dress up my 1998 F150 a little with chrome. The handle covers fit perfectly and were extremely easy to install. These were a little difficult to find (probably because my truck is 14 years old. But it runs fantastic and best of all...it's paid for!!!)
3,I find myself going back ot O'Reilly's DNS and Bind.,"I bought all of Craig's Linux Library books but NFS and Samba. They are all great books and easier to read than O'Reilly but I find myself using my O'Reilly DNS and Bind book over this one because Craig doesn't cover Bind 9 in detail such as rndc.He also dropped the ball on giving complete info on how to install and configure Bind 9.I hope the second edition is better. Until then, get O'Reilly's DNS book. You'll be glad you did."
4,Excellent choice for my Konica Minolta DIMAGE Z5,"I bought this case for my Konica Minolta DIMAGE Z5 camera a couple of years ago. It has served me well and has allowed me to carry my camera safely wherever I go. The DIMAGE Z5 is a bulky piece of equipment if you consider the latest ""svelte"" camera models doing the rounds on Amazon and other online retailers. This case is well stitched and is made of strong material that gives me the confidence that my camera is safe inside it. The build quality of this case is impressive for its price. The zipper is made of good strong parts not like the cheap ones in lower priced cases from other brands. Overall, I am happy with this purchase and would be glad to recommend it to someone."
1,dont but this case,"i bought this case from amazon, all was good with the shipping and handling now for the case itslef: its so small, it barley hold my z2 camera, with luck you can put in also some 4 pack of aa or an extra sd card etc, no manuals or anything like it. the padding itself is nothing, if by chance it will fall, it will prob wont do any good.im returning this product to amazon and instead i recommend buying the m-rock rocky mountain."
3,you pay for what you get.,Not a bad bag for the cost.It could be a little bigger.put together very good.could use more padding.
5,Lots of fun,"What fun! This book had me laughing out loud one chapter, then got serious in another. You could sum it up as coming of age all over again. Near the end it got heavier to deal with but a quick read and the dialogue is hysterical at times.If you liked this book, check out these similar ones--Tom Perrotta's Joe CollegeJoe College: A NovelNick Hornby's High FidelityHigh Fidelity: A Novel"
2,Does this guy have Tourette's about illicit sex and drugs?,"It takes a white to get going--and then doesn't. This is the third book I've read of Tropper's and while there is a degree of sex and drugs in his other books, this one is only about teenage sex and pot (despite any claims to the contrary). It's quite egregious. I'm not a prude but there's only so much you can take and then it's just a bad joke--pointless, embarrassing and boring. I couldn't even finish the thing."
5,LOL,"This is the first Jonathan Tropper book I have read, and it certainly won't be the last. I laughed out loud for most of the book due to Joe's quick wit and one liners, and by the end of the book I was in tears. Great author, great book. Can't wait to read Tropper's other works."
2,memories,"Who doesn't have a boatload of memories from their high school days? There's the hot, older woman you always desired. The high school sweetheart and first love. The buddies you ran with and the obnoxious bully. This author covers all this and more. At first, I was pulled into the story and tripped down my own memory lane. After a bit, things began to sound a tad bit sophmoric and juvenile. It was easy to predict the plot and the humorous tone of the writing just didn't carry well. The ending was okay but left me wanting resolution with the bully.It's not that the guy can't write. He's got some chops and tosses in the occasional insight. I think that if he would let go of high school, there's a nice book, waiting to be written. There's several titles available but after this one, I won't risk my money."
5,Can't rave enough about this book!,"This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a very long time. It's laugh outloud funny, cry outloud poignant and well-written besides. Jonathan Tropper can be goofy, but he's also dead-on insightful. (About the women in Joe's hometown: ""Cleavage, like the good china, was reserved for special occastions, and even then was displayed sparingly."") It only took the first two paragraphs of this book to grab me, and then, as they say, I could not put it down. Overlook the fact that it's a hardcover (it's much cheaper than most anyhow) and take this one to the beach. I am a bookseller and I can't remember ever being as entertained as I was by The Book of Joe."
1,Melodramatic,"I didn't read the reviews until after I read the book, since I wanted to make up my own mind. I think Publishers Weekly hit it on the head in their review in which the reviewer called the book a sophomore effort that relied too heavily on canned lines and easy melodrama. If this kind of book sounds like something you'd be interested in, do yourself a favor and get it from the library."
2,Pack-Up Your Adjectives,"I guess sometimes this is what we have to show for allowing poppy little english grammar ditties to be so catchy. I can see Mr. Tropper as the kind of writer motivated by two things: Schoolhouse Rock and vocab-building page-a-day calendars. The writing here was laughable at times, overly flowing and several syllables longer than needed. The vocabulary used was over the top for what was required, and all the more jarring in that the author tends to use (or wants to use) a seemingly accessible, pop-culture-riddled, casualness to the story-telling. The story itself is ok, though nothing exceptional here. For a better, albeit surreal, look at the ""voyage-to-the-hometown-of-renowned-author"" genre, try Jonathan Carroll's *The Land of Laughs*."
5,This book was Soooooo Good!!!,"Predictable? Maybe. But all in all - This book was absolutely, totally enjoyable! Joe was a hoot! and deserved every bad thing that happened to him. He also deserved every good thing that happened to him!!! Loved his story, loved his friends - loved his nephew. Finished the book a while ago and I still worry about Wayne! I wrote a little ditty about Wayne - - ""Wayne's gonna die and I'm gonna cry on that sad and gloomy day. Wayne's gonna die and I'm gonna cry and there's nothing more to say."" How many books have you read where you get so involved with a character, you write a little ditty about them???"
1,Not so good,"(...) Its a second rate novel that is trite and follows a formula that has been done before (and done better.) How many stereotypes can the author fit in one book - friend's mother who is the object of his lust, former school mate turned bad cop, gay friend with AIDS. Please."
2,Good start....very dull ending,Usually you can tell if a book is going to keep your interest right away but not with this book...this one started out promising but really fizzled by the end. The characters all turned into saints...The plot turned lifetime for women. The joe character was totally not realistic...falling off a cliff.. getting beaten up all the time but not sustaining major injuries...all the gay characters must die for some reason..couldn't they just have had regular lives as most gay people do??/ Wow was this a waste of time....
4,More to it than its cover,"The Book of Joe by Jonathan Tropper is quite good. When I finished it, I knew I would try others by him. How can you have a coming of age story when most of the main characters are in their 30s? Yet that is what you have.Coming of age, a transformation, a maturing; yes that was it. The characters start out somewhat two-dimensionally but morph into fully fleshed out characters. There are some aspects of the plot, foreshadowing, that are predictable. But even in those moments they aren't entirely predictable containing one or more twists that you couldn't have anticipated.I had to know what would happen. Two thirds of the way through the book, there seemed no good ending. Yet the ending was perfect in its quasi-ambivalence. I enjoyed the interplay of generations. And there were true epiphanal moments, often achieved by looking through the eyes of someone else. How often do we miss those moments ourselves?I strongly recommend this book."
1,This one was a miss for me....,"My first Jonathan Tropper experience was with And This Is Where I Leave You and I absolutely loved it. However, this one was a miss for me; I did not enjoy it at all. If I read this one first, I would have never tried to read another one of his books."
5,The Book of Joe,Purchased this book for my grandson Joe. the author Jonathan Tropper is a fantastic writer. Will order more of his.

BY FAR .........THESE LAME A$$ RAPPERS(NOT M.C.'S) TODAY TAKE AWAY THE HYPE BEAT AND YOU GOTS NUTTIN'.........JUST BECAUSE U BRAINLESS KIDS ARE BUYING $HIT LIKE 50 CENT AND GAME DOSEN'T MAKE THERE $HIT HOT........HELL MILLI VANILLI SOLD MILLIONS OF RECORDS TOO......THINK BEFORE YOU OPEN YA LIP JUST MAYBE SOMETHING INTELLIGENT WILL ESCAPE FOR A CHANGE........YA DIGG
3,"Not bad, but not that good","I was mad at the references she kept making to what she's done, I feel like forget what you did back then what are you doing now. The best songs on the album are ""Ride wit me"" and ""Bkly (Live That)"" and ""Where Home is"", this album could have done without the talking at the beginning of the songs (annoying). I think I like Lyte as an actress better now, she has a re-occurring role on ""Half & Half"" which is on UPN."
4,scale,"This item arrived quickly and in good shape. it is a very nice scale, but very hard to program. it shows a different weight every time you step on the scale regardless of how long it has been inbetween. a few seconds or a few hours."
5,Best Scale I've found,Since Pure Weight Loss went belly up I wanted a scale that was as accurate as theirs. What a find this turned out to be. Theirs sold for $ 325.00 without all the hydration and BMI measurments (bells and whistle that this one has). My hubby and I are really happy with this one. It is accurate. The programming for advanced features takes a little time. You need to read and follow the instructions for this.Also recommend putting those felt feet (Moving felt) on legs as a protection to your floors. I love this scale!!!
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this scale for my elderly father. However, this scale was difficult to use and poor quality. I returned it for a refund."
1,Not accurate,This scale looks very nice but I can put the same thing on the scale 4 times and get a different number every time. I will definitely be sending this scale back to amazon for a refund as its not accurate and in my weight loss journey I definitely need accuracy.
2,Disappointingly frothy!,"I'm not a great fan of Chesney, her books are generally too incredible and move far too fast for my taste. 'His Lordship's Pleasure' is particularly guilty of this. Though only a 200 page regency it moves swiftly through a complex and yet completely meaningless plot and so wastes precious time that could be spent developing the somewhat two dimensional characters. If you want an enjoyable romance however and do not ask for believability or an immersing read then you may well still enjoy this as it has some charm. It is nothing like a Georgette Heyer however (which the publisher claims) and frankly the comparison is an insult to Heyer. A mildly enjoyable adventure."
5,a tp fan's must have,"This book is for anyone who has ever listened to the music of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. This book is written in a Q & A format, and you get a close up look behind what was going through Tom's head when he wrote/recorded any one of your favorite songs. Mr. Petty is probably one of the most under-rated and overlooked musical geniuses of our time. He is solid and has been for nearly 30 years. This is a great gift for any rock and roll music lover. Find out about the Tom Petty-Elvis Presley connection and much, much more! The must have book for 2005. Expertly written by Paul Zollo. One great read. Get it today!"
3,Good insight into Petty...Better if you are a musician,"I have long been a fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers but have never gone beyond just listening to the music. This book was a pretty interesting read and provided alot of background about the band and how they came to be and to thrive in the music world. The last part of the book can be a bit of a bore if you are not a musician as it discusses at length, chords, verses, bridges, etc. which to me (a non-musician) was boring as hell. I would have preferred to hear more about what inspired the songs and some of the background about the lyrics. The section about the Travelling Wilburys was alot more personal and less about the actual music and for me that was a much more interesting read.All in all it's a good book about a great band."
5,Very enjoyable read !!!,"I have always been a big fan of Tom Petty's music. This book follows the course of Petty's carrer and his evolution as a songwriter and musician using Petty's own words. The author (who acts more as an interviewer) has a knack for asking the questions that I wanted answered as well. I came away with the impression that Petty is a very sincere artist who, above all else, cares about the music. A fun and fascinating trip through a great career. Highly recommended."
5,A must read for Tom Petty fans,"For fans of Tom Petty and his music, this is the ultimate read. For me personally, Tom Petty is no less than a God in the world of rock and roll music. For those of us who enjoy Petty's music, and desire to know more about this exceptionally talented, but publicity shy man, this book has it all. Zollo asks all the right questions and the ""conversational"" style seems to work well. It gives Petty fans a glimpse into the mind of this humble, sensitive, and highly intelligent man, who has more integrity, and honesty than one is used to seeing in the celebrity world these days. A satisfying and entertaining read that any Petty fan should not pass up."
5,fascinating conversations,This book is wonderful. It is addictive for any Tom Petty fan but is equally interesting and great reading for anyone who likes to read. Wonderful pictures are also placed throughout the book. Highly recomended!
4,Worth the effort,"A long read but worth it. A fascinating insight into the creative process of one of the RnR greats. My only disappointment is, much like the adage ""you should never meet your heroes"", TP loses that good-ole boy mixed with West Coast laid-back image and comes across as a bit of a hard-ass control freak. But how else do you produce so many great albums?"
5,Yoga the exercise for life,I love the DVD as much as I enjoy Adrienne's classes at her studio Namaste. It is great for when you vacation/travel so you can keep up with your practice. It is a tough but exhilarating workout and well worth it!
4,pretty good workout,"This is a good workout as far as power yoga is concerned. It will work all of your muscles and definitely provides some challenge (I previously did cardio and weights on a weekly basis). My only complaint is the poses seem somewhat rushed and there isn't much of a calming effect with the workout because of it. Bryan Kest's power yoga DVD (my favorite) has challenging moves, yet still promotes calmness and fluidity. This DVD does have slightly more varied moves than Kest's, but Reed seems to sacrifice the calm and fluidity that should come with these moves. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend this DVD if you are looking for a good workout, but Reed's brisk voice seemed to put me off a little. Wasn't too crazy about the music, but you couldn't really hear it anyway."
2,Unsatisfying,"I bought this DVD based on the raving reviews here and I was very disappointed. It was fast paced, and while I had no problem keeping up, I felt like I wasn't getting a good enough workout. I am used to a more rigorous Ashtanga flow and to me this was a lame imitation. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially those who like a challenging yoga workout."
5,exactly what i wanted and got.,Needed to attach my Wiebetech mobile u320 RAID server to a newer motherboard and it works like a charm. Don't forget to get the latest updates from Adaptec
5,The XP 310,"This gun rocks! I won it and since then whenever I use it in water fights I totally drench my opponents. Great water capacity and four nozels with 1x, 5x, 10x, and 20x the water of the XP 70. I have heard that it is low quality but I haven't had any problems with it. It is too heavy for little kids. I gave it a one for being educational because it is not supposed to be educational. If you want to get a water gun get this one."
3,Not a smart buy,"XP 310? Sounds like a real powerful gun. The sad news is that it's not. The settings are useless and nearly equilivent, (4 settings: illegimate, weak, weaker, and pathetic). Its a little bulky for its power and can't take much punishment. Parents, don't get this for your kids. The gun is also a poor choice for a veteran. The main problem is that every thing is so AVERAGE. Its weaker than a CPS (any model) and big enough that you cannot carry any other weapons except sidearms. Pick an older water gun to be your main weapon (if you can find them). My recomandations are the XP 75, XP 125, XP 150, or speedloader 1500. I gave it 3 stars for educational value because it's a puzzlement to figure out why Larami put four different nozzles on it. You don't have time to change nozzles when it makes so little difference."
3,okay for the price,"Doesn't clean all the powder residue out, however using in tandem with a wire brush first, then wrapping a cleaning patch around the Tornado Brush to clean up left over works quite well."
2,Tornado kind of works,I purchased this item with the only hope that it would help remove bullet lube from the chamber. Unfortunately it does no better removing bullet lube than a boresnake. I may have to bite the bullet and purchase aWilson 1911 45 CAL CHAMBER CLEANING TOOL (42445).
3,lcloudt,"I haven't had a chance to ride it yet, but here is what I noticed right off. It says it is a women's bike. I am 5'5.5"", and it is a little small for me. Also the bike in the picture is blue and the one I received is red/silver. It reminds me more of a boy's bike."
4,Schwinn 24 in Boy's Mnt Bike,"Beautiful bike! My son loved it. I would have given it 5 stars except we had to replace all the tire valve stems before we could properly inflate the tires and the handle bar stem is really not height adjustable, but for now the height is fine. I guess when my son grows we'll have to buy a larger bike. A good quality 24 inch boys bike at a decent price is very hard to find and this one fits the bill."
4,Nice Boys Bike,"This is a very sharp looking well made bicycle for the money. It goes together fairly easily -- all you need is a screwdriver, Allen head and open end wrenches along with a tire pump. I spent just over an hour uncrating it and putting it together. (The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the handle bar height is not adjustable.)"
3,manufacture mistake,"Before ordering this bike I called the manufacture to see if it came with a quick release on both wheels. They assured me it did. However, the bike I got only has quick release on the front wheel. I called back the manufacture, and they informed me that their ""bill of materials"" was wrong - there is only one quick release. After complaining, they said they would send me a new set of wheels (both quick release). What they sent me only had a quick release on the rear wheel. This is quite frustrating. The original wheels are silver while the replacement set is black. Using the quick release wheel from each set, the bike has now one silver and one black wheel.Otherwise, the bike appears to be a decent build for the price and is fine for my son's purposes."
4,Good Bike & Components campared to Bike shops,Pros- fairly lightweight bike for the money- bike comes mostly assembled- good thumb and finger gear shifters- not too difficult to assemble if you know bikes- bike is better than $300 bikes at bicycle shops that had handle bar twist shifter- 8 year old son likes it a lot and gives him a better taste for what a real mt bike will be like- bike was packaged well in a heavy bike box and shipped quickly- 24 inch wheels and nice size frame with adjustable seat to handle growth--should last my son a 2-3 yearsCons- no holes in the frame for water bottle holder- you have to know bikes a bit to put it together (directions are not that great)- had to adjust brakes and gears a bit to get it running smoothly- headset is not adjustable and headset is kind of cheap with a single bolt
4,"Not just ""for girls""!","I'm no liitle girl, rather a 57 year old male -a physician and surgeon,and I was very much impressed by this gem when it aired recently on Sundance. I was hoping to download its signature song here, ""Je ne partirai pas ce soir"" (unsuccessfully) when I came across the first and only review. It helps to know French, I suppose, but it is a fine film indeed and I enjoyed it immensely ... despite my age and sex."
5,Great Lunch Box,"This lunch box is deceively large. The ""garage"" comes with the perfect size plastic container for pasta, salads, etc. I throw mine in the washer when it starts to look gross and it cleans nicely and hasn't fallen apart. I only wish they came in different colors."
4,Great double stroller,"I reall enjoy this stroller. I have a 13month old a 3 month old. It is big and bulky, but it is a double stroller so I didn't expect anything different. I have trouble getting the carseat in and out of the rear seat, so I usually put it in the front."
5,Nice Piece of Equipment,"We purchased the Duoglider to haul the two kids around the mall and grocery store - it was easy to extract from the box, and we found it much easier to use than expected - just remember its like a truck when it comes turning in tight isles and where the merchant has stacked Holiday junk they want you to see and purchase.Great product so far, works well with 18 month old and 2 month old still in infant seat.Cheers"
4,Good stroller with hard to use storage,"I've had this stroller for over 3 years now, and it is still going strong. It is very durable. We take this on trails in the woods as well as through the mall. It is impossible to steer with one hand when there are two kids in it. Might be wise to invest in a bluetooth headset if you plan on using the phone while pushing this :) My major gripe and the reason I gave it only 4 stars is the big storage compartment under the seats. It is a great size, but nearly impossible to use if you've got the back seat fully reclined. You either have to unsnap the mesh on the side (which only gives you partial access to storage), or you have to cram all your stuff into the storage via the gap between the front and back seats. Other than that, it's been a really great piece of baby gear."
4,A Double Stroller That Pleases Most,"You can't please everyone because there is no stroller that meets every need. So far, for our first four months with our twins, we've been happy. We like how it coordinates with our other Graco items and that our Snugride car seats snap right in with ease. The stroller itself maneuvers easily. It has gotten a bit banged up like in the plastic tray areas, but we've gotten used to any heaviness. It opens and shuts with one touch and so far has been stable and sturdy with our twins in their car seats."
5,Great Stroller,"I have a special needs 2 & 1/2 year old who needs to be in a stroller for longs walks or trips to the mall/store. I've also just had a baby. I needed a double stroller to take them both out and after research and price checks, I chose this one. There is plenty of room for my 2 & 1/2 year old in the front and the car seat by Graco fits into the back great. When the new baby is ready, there will be tons of room for him in the back too. It rides nicely and is easy to push and turn. Great product!"
4,Overall great but tray does not drop as advertised,"Overall I am quite happy with this stroller. It is light compared to other twin strollers I have owned and is easy to maneuver. It is easy to open but needs both hands to fold it. At first, I found it difficult to close it but with some practice (10-15 times), I was able to do it easily. It is a classic Graco sturdy product.There are 2 reasons I did not give it 5 stars:1. The bottom tray does not drop as shown in the pictures.2. I would have liked this stroller to roll even when folded. It would make it easy to lug it for shorter distances (like at the airport or from car trunk to the curb etc.) where you don't want to go through the hassle of opening it and closing it for short distances."
4,Quality vs. Functionality,"This model is more posh than some of their others, with very nice canopies for both seats and a large storage area, however it is not as functional as the one that I have at our other home, as this one has only one adult cup holder and when you put the upper canopy back, it covers that space making it impossible to use. When you push it away to reveal the cupholder and storage, it covers the infant area so much that the baby gets upset if he's not asleep.I also am not crazy about the hard plastic wheels versus the rubber that I have on other models, but the stroller is great quality and easy to setup/fold down with a reasonable weight so it's manageable."
4,The product is good,"My angels one is 27 months and one is 9 months are having fun with this new Stroller. It served my purpose well. I found little difficulty while closing and opening this Stroller other than that, its fine."
2,used it twice,should have gotten a jogging stroller instead. this thing is huge. i would run into everything. save your money and get a joggind stroller
5,Shipment,I ordered this stroller on a Sunday and received it before 10 am on Tuesday. I have not opened the box since this is a gift for my grandson and his wife for my 2 great-grandsons.
4,Graco DuoGlider LX,Great deal for the money. I researched this and the Quatro since I have a graco infant seat so I wanted to stick with the same brand. I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 5 month old. It works great for shopping at the mall and rides to the post office.Pro's:*Narrow so it fits through doors and aisles well*I didn't think it was too heavy*Affordable*Durable*Lots of room underneathCon's:*Canopy in the rear covers cup holder when pulled all the way back*Basket underneath doesn't fold down*Rear seat only has 2 positions Up and Down*I have a hard time unfolding it...not one handed*The snack trays have to be snapped on and offOverall works great for what I need it for. If you have twins I wouldn't recommend if they are older because the rear doens't have a snack tray/cup holder and the front seat is short (wouldn't work for napping.)
4,would recommend,"Bought this stroller a few weeks ago and am very pleased with it. It maneuvers very easily and has a lot of space for daiper bag, etc. underneath. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of five is because it's kind of a pain to fold, you have to push the front canopy all the way down first before it will fold properly. Once it does fold, it folds up pretty nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space considering it is a double stroller. It would also be nice if the front tray folded up to make it easier for the child to get in. Overall though this stroller is definately worth the money and the two complaints really aren't that bad, I really just put them in there for people like myself who are buying this online and can't take an in person look at the item before buying it."
4,Good stroller,"For the money the stroller has served its' purpose. It is definitely not the best one out there, but for a second stroller - it is perfect. It is difficult to keep clean and heavy and bulky."
4,Great product.......but....,"Great product, does what its suppose to do but I wish it had a rear swivel tire too for easy mobility"
4,Great Stoller,"This is a great stroller, lots of basket room too. I love the rain guards and lots of leg room. Does not turn the best but no double strollers do. It's fits two car seats and I would definitely recommend!"
4,Great value for price,"I bought this for my two granchildren, a nine months old and two & half years old. We are very happy with it. Feel it is a very good value for the price. Folds easily, has lots of storage space below the seats,very sturdy and has sufficient coverage for shade. The only drawback we found was it was a little harder to stear if an older child is in the front seat."
4,great low cost woodworking tool,I use this for all cuts of stock up to 2x4's - works great with a bearsaw - one of the thin blade Japanese style saws. being plastic it will get chewed up after some time of use - however for 5 bucks its well worth it.
4,great gift for new carpeter,Great gift for your new carpeter who doesn't have all the tools yet. This makes angles easy and light work.
2,slots too narrow,"the slots to guide the saw is too narrow, i will have to bring this to a hardware store to look for a saw that is thin enough to use with this thing!"
4,Exactly the miter box I need,This suits my novice carpenter needs. Holding up well under light use for cutting wood trim pieces. I'm happy with my choice.
4,A great little miter box if used correctly,"I ordered it specifically for use with a Japanese-style pull saw to cut some small 1/2"" molding a milled to hold glass in a china cabinet doors and am finding it very accurate and easy to use. However, with its plastic construction and very thin kerf slots, I would not recommend it for long-term heavy use with a wider kerf saw."
4,Miter box is totally okay.,"It's a miter box, it does it's job, it's not defective. I can't get too giddy over a miter box."
1,Sounds like a rip-off to me.,Just the fact that mainly and Saturday are misspelled makes this seem like a bootleg CDR that some individual is trying to sell via Amazon. It would be nice if Amazon could confirm ir this is a legitimate item.
4,Tons of information but a little over most people's head...,Full of very good information and very well written. I have been in the medical field for 30+ years and I found this book needed my full attention and concentration. Not an easy read but you get a lot from it once you get through it. Interesting.
4,"works fine, good price","Seems to work fine. Don't have enough TVs to use all four outs, but I have tried each bank and they all work. I am old and weary, but I could not see any signal degradation on my 60-incher."
5,Excellent for the purpose,This product is built with quality. It does the job exactly as expected. It is easy to set up and use. I would recommend it to anyone needing this type of product. I am using it from my satellite tv box to connect to my TV and a video capture card in my PC with excellent results.
3,Food for thought...,"I know it is a wonderful book because I own an original. I was able to aquire the entire trilogy from England, in first printing for about 80.00. Look around before you buy. Affordably priced may not be the best price..."
2,Buy their first CD (like the exorcist...),"I saw murder by death in 2002 live and was blown away by their excellence. since then i have not been impressed. i saw them preform songs off this CD in august and hope to god they dont continue in the direction they are going. they have lost their originality and the lead singer must have watched ""walk the line"" too many times b/c he is trying to be folky and sound like johnny cash. the cello player sarah is still amazing and about all that this band has going for them unless they go back to their roots that produced their first album ""like the excorcist..."". they need to be more insrumental like they used to be and less 1960's country. lyrics such as ""13 years have passed since that day"" sung by their lead singer show his lack of originality; on the other hand if what they are going for is fake folk then they are on the right track. on a positive note they are still great live preformers no matter how much i want the past re-occur."
2,"A repeat of other, more thorough instruction...","At only 87 pages, Giovanni Civardi's ""Drawing Human Anatomy"" is TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE of the subject covered over 50 years ago in ""Atlas Of Human Anatomy For The Artist"" by Stephen Rogers Peck, and since Peck's now classic text covers anatomy in 257 pages, it is difficult to pronounce Civardi's peremptory treatment of anatomy as a bargain and give it a many-star rating. It is not bad instruction or anything like that. What is there, is GOOD. It's just that when better books rate five stars, bargain books like this really aren't that much of a bargain. In art instruction, less is seldom ""better"". Some will give such a book a very high rating, perhaps not knowing what else is on the market."
5,perfect addition to my dehydrator,This was a perfect addition to my dehydrator. Indistinguishable from the 4 trays that came with it originally. Good buy.
4,added dehydrating,Worked great with my dehydrator- bonus of getting 2 more trays worth of dried fruits and veggies. I even think adding a couple trays helped the drying time rather than slowed it down. I am even considering adding a few more!
4,"Overall Great Case, but...","This is exactly what I was looking for, this case will provide great protection and allow me to carry my camera safely.Pros:- Very compact, much smaller than other similar bags I have used.- Canon T2i fits perfectly inside, very glad I went with this size rather than the Zoom 3.- Good padding inside.- It is comfortable and doesn't seem to stand out too much.Cons:- Noisy.-- Right when I took this out of the box I realized that would be a problem, the bag has five metals zippers that make significant noise anytime the bag is moved even just a little; because I will be using this bag primarily for backpacking and hiking this would get annoying real quick. I ended up clipping the metal ""handle"" portion of the zippers off and created a small loop (figure-8 follow through) custom handle using an Air Force boot shoelace (really durable and thin) and that fixed the noise issue.- The top flap is a little awkward to open, still new to the case so I might just have to get used to it."
2,Too big,"I was looking for a small bag to carry my new Panasonic DMC-FZ35. I'm not a professional, don't have a lot of accessories, just wanted to keep my camera safe. The camera in the photo of the listing appears to fit nicely in the bag, but in reality my camera was swimming in it. There was a full 2 inches to spare on the side of the camera. I went to a local camera shop and found a Tamrac Adventure 3, which is smaller, (still bigger than I'd like, but it's the best I can find) and I am returning this one. I have no doubt this is a good bag, but just be aware that it is much bigger than it looks in the photo."
2,Poor Quality,"I like this tape series, but the DVD scans are VERY POOR quality. They are grainy and almost blurred. The quality of the VHS tapes are much better. There is no reason for this.Save your money. Buy the tapes if you want this series. We can't support people who put out a poor quality product to save money on decent DVD scanning."
5,THE GREATEST STORIES TOLD BY A MASTERFUL STORYTELLER!,"One of the greatest legends of cinema brings four of the greatest stories to life in ""Charlton Heston presents The Bible,"" a powerful, soul-stirring epic! Heston reads from the stories of Genesis, Exodus, and the Four Gospels with great theatricality, telling them as they may have been told decades before they were written down. While his performances may be a little over the top, they fit this form of production perfectly.Together with a mesmerizing orchestral soundtrack by Leonard Rosenman, powerful images, and visits to the places where these events may have actually happened, ""Charlton Heston presents The Bible"" belongs in everyone's collection of Biblical films and documentaries!Film/DVD Grade: A"
5,The Bible comes to life through his words,"Charlton Heston brings the words of the Bible to life through the natural inflections of his voice. Passages I've read have a deeper meaning as I hear the words spoken with eloquence: anger as he spoke of Jesus turning over the money changers tables, and compassion as he tells the story of Mary. He walks where Jesus walked, and one gets a feel not just for the stories, but also for the land in which they took place. Makes me want to go and see them for myself. Well done."
1,They're Bankrupt,"Cygnion is out of business folks. For good reason. I have a full system with 10 phones. Lots of problems - noise problems like clicking and crackling, and range is really short, about 30-40 feet. Avoid."
2,Lack Of Feature Makes me move on...,I bought this from Office Depot when it first came out. The biggest problem was the display for Caller ID doesn't show the Name. Its no convenient since I have $90 Sony and Panasonic cordless phones that have NAME and NUMBER on the handset... I called Cygnion and they blamed the phone company. My patience wore thin and I returned it. Bought the 2.4 gig Panasonic and it does all that I need....
1,Avoid At All Cost,"This is the biggest mistake I made in 2001. CyberGenie is a product that had a great promotions department behind it, but no engineers to back them up. With Cygnion out of business, CG has become nothing more than a cult group in Yahoo! clubs. And many of the members there are trying to sell to the others. It's quite a shame...great idea with a broad market appeal. Maybe Seimens can really make it happen."
1,Basic concept problem,"What are things people looking for in any phone systems? I would think it is 'Clearity', but can I find that in this phone system?My rating of this system will show my answer for above question. Additionally, where is the option for choosing either voice recognition or just a key pad input? I find voice recognition most irritating feature of this phone when working in fast paced environment. Do you want to know how long it will take a person to transfer a call?"
2,"Good Idea, Poor Execution and Quality",Do I need to say more? Handsets last six months to a year. Speech engine has it's fair share of problems with any kind of background noise.The quality just isn't there. I further understand that the company is out of business. Doesn't really matter much because they never answered the phone and the website was never available.
3,Somewhere in the middle,"I bought the CyberGenie thinking it was the answer to all my telephone prayers. It does have a lot of wonderful features, nearly everything I'd want. I had a hard time getting 2 lines working with an external fax and didn't get any help from tech support. Tech support isn't very supportive. My main complaint is the handsets. I wish there was a variety to choose from. I wrote to Cygnion about that and they never acknowledged my suggestion. I too had trouble with the range, but got a USB Extention and moved the base away from my computer and nearer the ceiling and it works pretty well now, though no where near 900 feet. I have a 2000 sq. ft. bakery / cafe and it works all around the bakery. The handsets aren't really loud enough when it's noisy here. I wish they offered a desk phone option, speaker phone option, and just a louder ring option. It's working pretty well, but I have yet to find the perfect answer."
2,Poor Range,"On the outside, this looked like a great product. The published range was up to 900 feet; however, when used in fairly friendly conditions, [inside a wood frame home] the max useable range was more like 80 feet - what a dissappointment. When trying to work with the technical assistance, they had only minimal suggestions and finally said ""tough luck"". I don't think they know what they are doing. I will wait for further developments and perhaps things will improve."
2,Cygnion files for bankrupcy.,Do you really want to order a product that has gotten very mixed reviews from a company that just went bankrupt?summary: Good idea. Poor execution. BANKRUPT COMPANY
1,"Good idea, bad product","My cat typically loves laser pointers and will chase them for as long as I'm willing to play. However, with the Bada Beam, all he can do is sit there and look at it. The Bada Beam's light spins in circles on the floor so fast that I find it hard to believe that any cat could actually keep up with it.Multipet had a good idea, but failed on the execution."
2,GOOD BAD IDEAS,"I agree. A GOOD idea poorly thought out. YOu would have to mount it on a pole or hang it from the celing to get the desired effect. Rex is laser CRAZY and he is not into this toy.I hope they are working on a new design, maybe the mirror should rotate ?PS. We played with it some more and found if I set it on top of the very high chest it works ok and Rex will be interested SO am bumping it up a star."
5,Great!,"I have a very active kitten, 10 mos, and an older fat cat, 8 years, and both of them love it! I was desperate to find a toy that would keep the kitten entertained and burn off excess energy so she'd stop tormenting the older cat. But to my surprise, both cats love to play with this, sometimes together.The base is stationary while a laser light is reflected off a mirror and you can position the mirror to either reflect on to the floor on on the wall. The one downfall is that the pattern of the light is very monotonous and sometimes my cats get a little tired of the motion. When that happens, I usually just pick up the unit and make my own light pattern.The unit is excellent for turning on and leaving unattended. It automatically shuts off after about 15 minutes...and it takes quite a while for the batteries to wear down.So, if your cat likes laser toys, they should enjoy this toy."
1,A toy no cat will play with...,"I have to agree 100% with the first review. I just got this, and my cats are more interested in the box it came in than the laser beam this thing spits out. (I guess they're like children in that way!) The beam has only two settings - one that is emitted directly about 1 foot ahead of the device on the floor, the other about horizontal from it so that it will appear low on your walls or furniture. Basically, it's just like a revolving police light on a squad car; it simply spins a dot around in a monotonous circle over and over. My cats just looked at it in puzzlement instead of chasing it like I'd hoped. Then they looked at me like, 'Woman, why did you buy this crazy thing?' To get them to take an interest in it, I have to actually pick up the device and shake it around to make a random enough pattern for them to chase. And even then, they'd rather lie around. There's $19.99 I'll never see again...!"
1,Bada BAD!,"I bought this for my cat a few months ago, because he just loves playing with a laser pointer. The whole concept of this toy was great but they should've expanded their ideas a bit more. For the size of the toy you would think that it would point further out than it does. I'm not sure about others but most cats I know like to run back and forth a room chasing the laser, maybe even jump up the wall. As opposed to with the Bada Beam that just goes in a circle, reversing its direction every once in awhile. My cat never avoids the laser pointer, when he sees that red light he jumps right up! But with the Bada Beam, he will just sit and stare at it. The whole point is so that you don't have to hold it and let the cats go crazy! NOPE! It's one thing for me to be disappointed, but it's clear that my cat was more disappointed."
1,DOA Ba-Da-Beam,"The Ba-Da-Beam arrived DOA. I cut it out of the packaging, inserted the included batteries and adjusted the mirror. The light came on, but absolutely nothing else happened. I read the directions on the package, which were vague at best. They implied that the light would come on when the mirror was adjusted to one of two positions. I moved the mirror around, but the only thing that happened was that the light went out. I returned the Ba-Da-Beam and decided to buy the Frolicat BOLT auto laser toy instead."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"My little dog LOVES to chase a lazer! I thought this would be a way for her to get the fun and exercise she wants without wearing out our wrists! Not so. #1, it projects onto the walls, not the floor. Even setting it at an angle on a shelf, it really doesn't work for the floor. It is also very difficult to get it to stay angled on a shelf due to the rounded bottom/side. #2 it moves VERY fast. Really, too fast for my dog to follow. #3 it is pretty cheap plastic and after just a few uses, it quit working.I don't know if a cat would play with it, but skip it for your dog."
1,Not so great,I wish I would have read these reviews before plunking down the money for this. It's light goes around too fast for my cat and kitten to even try to keep up with. I tried to place it at several levels and it didn't work so well. My biggest concern is that the laser light can sometimes shine across my cats' faces. It would seem unsafe to have the light shine in their eyes.I will be returning it asap.
1,"good idea, bad execution","100% in agreement with Brian's assesment. The idea is great, execution sucks. My cats just look at it with puzzlement in their eyes.Here's hoping version 2.0 will be better:)"
2,Not worth your money,I bought this toy for two of my cats that love to play with lasers. I thought by buying this toy it would provide them with entertainment when I am not home. The laser moves too quickly which results in my cats losing interest in the toy. The toy does have two settings but it means you can have the laser appear on the floor or wall. Overall it is poorly designed toy and not worth your money.
3,"""Too fast for cats""","Good idea, but way too fast for cats. My cats lost interest fast. First one shipped did not work and was sent another free of charge."
2,Not what I thought,"I had actually bought this product at a local pet store in the city I live in for my two cats. I got it out of the package and put in some batteries, and it started out at the laser pointer moving very slowly made one inch per 3 mins. On the packaging it does say it will start out slow, I was thinking for like a minute of less, I understand some products need warming up. Well after like 30 mins of it moving slow it finally started going fast, and my male cat was chasing it, but it was going in circles, and after 30 sec of playing and chasing and going in circles he didn't want to do it anymore cuz he was getting dizzy. My female wanted nothing to do with it, but she is a lazy cat anyway. My male loves laser lights and will play with one all day but not when it takes 30 mins for it to got fast and it going in circles the whole time. It would be a good product if it jumped around and did zig zags and went in other directions, but just going in circles the whole not a good idea."
1,Junk,"I bought this at a local pet store for my cat. She loves laser pointers and I thought that this would keep her entertained when I'm busy. The instructions were pretty lacking on how to exactly get the device working. It turns out that the toy was broken from the start. The toy seemed cheap so this wasn't a huge surprise. A decent idea for a cat toy, but the build quality is atrocious."
1,Waste of money,"Like almost everyone has said in the reviews, their animals might play with the beam for a minute or two then never play with it again. I have five laser-crazy animals. The cats were more interested in the device (it makes a small whirring noise) and none chased the laser. One of the two dogs appeared interested, but quickly became confused and just stood in the middle of the circle looking at me quizzically. Maybe a really simple-minded pet will like this, but mine aren't interested. I tried putting the device on the floor, a shelf, the coffee table, and other locations looking for a way to get the critters to take interest. For the most part, the movement is too fast and too repetitive.Recommendations for improvement match others here - rotate the mirror (randomly), make the mirror fully adjustable instead of just two settings, and slow down the movement so pets can track it more easily."
1,Boring...,"Initial my cat liked it. But all it does is go in a circle. Round and round and round. And my cat got bored and now does not care for it at all. So I gave away to a freind with cats, maybe they will like?"
2,too eas,"My cat is extremely active and needs to be played with constantly to keep him out of trouble. He is also very athletic. This toy seemed like a good idea but he bores of it easily. It is too easy and predictable. He greatly prefers the randomness of a regular laser pointer. You can increase the difficulty by holding it and moving it around, but that defeats the purpose"
3,BORING,"A toy that can operate on its own is a great concept, however this one falls a little short in the entertainment department. The laser beam that is emitted goes too fast for ""pouncing"" and remains in the same boring, orbiting pattern, with a brief, periodic stop. If the microchip could be modified to produce a varied, slower laser beam, it would be a great toy. As it stands, my cats are attracted to it for only a short time, then they walk away without attempting to ""catch"" the light."
2,Bummer of a cat laser,"My cats love lasers but we're rarely around to play these days. I thought maybe this would be fun for the four of them to play a bit even when we're not around (set it and go if you know what I mean). It seems to have two settings and the lid is more in the way other than anything else. They will glance over when it is on, but little else."
3,Fun toy that could be tweaked,"I wasn't deterred by the ""moves too fast"" reviews because when I use the laser light I have with my cat, I move it quickly and she follows. I somehow thought that the top would swivel a bit and was wrong about that, however. So the big drawback to this toy is just that the circles it makes get old for my cat after a while. If you put the light up on the wall it's interesting to her but she won't play with it and if you put it on the ground it has very limited circles that it can make so it doesn't have the appeal of a normal laser chase game.It still seems to really entertain her, though. She'll get up close and watch it move around so even if she isn't playing, she's enjoying it."
2,Does Not Keep My Cats Attention,The concept is great. We adopted an outdoor cat and thought this would be a great way to keep her occupied however she quickly learned where the dot was coming from thereby became bored with the toy. Maybe other cats would do this but something to think about before you purchase.
3,laser toy,A couple of the cats will play with it a little when I put it on. They like it better if I use a hand held one.
2,"JUNK! It just goes up and down, only 2 points, cat quickly lost interest.","JUNK! It just goes up and down, only 2 points, cat quickly lost interest. IT doenst move around to keep her engaged, just back and forth."
1,UCK,"Not even worth the money, go ahead and spend a few more dollars for a good one.The Three unhappy Kittys"
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my cat. It is the dumbist concept yet!! What cat can keep up with a laser beem that goes in circles and so fast? I think they should take this thing apart and start over again!! I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. Don't waste your money....
1,Too fast for pet play,"I was excited to get this toy since my cat gets bored all the time. I put in the included batteries and turned it on. To my surprise, my normally evil kitty shied away! That's not what the problem is though. After a while the noise that it made, so annoying, wasn't such an issue except that it distracted the cat from the laser. So wait, maybe it is an issue. The other problem I have is that the beam goes super fast in a circle while stopping in random spots. Those random stops were so fast that even I didn't have time to locate the beam. My cat didn't have time to even try this toy as it really would be better suited for a party for everyone to stare at. That would probably be pretty dull anyway. You can hold the toy and play but it's too fast and doesn't work well that way either. You can't really aim it. I would not recommend this cat toy before finding someone who has one to try it out first."
2,"Great idea, bad design",I recently purchased this item but am returning it. Cons: doesn't have a switch to turn off/on or to vary the timing of the beam. Not worth it.
2,Fun for a dumb cat,"I have a kitten I can't keep up with and thought this would be a great idea. Wrong, he figured it out and lost interest in the first day. He will play with it for a few minutes but then looks to see where the beam is coming from, figures it out and walks away. A whole 2 minutes of fun."
2,NO,"The cps 2700 was a big disappointment, especially after its predecessor, the cps 2000 and 2500. The 2700's water supply is very good, but it's all down hill from there. Besides the funky coloring, the 2700 has a weak, easily broken stick pump rather than the attached pump of the 3200, Monsters, 2500, etc, and the pump is at a weird angle too. The nozzles, 2x, 5x and 10x are a step down from the older 2500's 5x, 10x and 20x, and the range is pitiful. Even the smaller 1700 has a good many feet over the 2700. Also, the nozzles are encased in some decorational purple flower thing that makes changing the nozzles difficult. If you're thinking about buying a 2700, I'd recommend going for the smaller 1700, or spending the extra few bucks for the 3200 or Monster."
4,Good Plot. Great Charachters. ...and very HOT!,"This was my first JoAnn Ross read, and I loved it! She kept me interested right to the end. And theres lots of steam, so if your anything like me, you'll love it. I can't wait to read more from this great author."
2,Ash goes thru a difficult transition period in 1981,"After Martin Turner (bass, vocals, production) left in 1980, he was briefly replaced in 1981 by the incomparable John Wetton (bass, vocals) of King Crimson & UK fame. I love John's voice, but unfortunately he does not shine here. Also, production quality is weak, and song-writing is somewhat uninspired. Must have been a real difficult transition period for the extremely talented Wishbone Ash crew. Wetton left before this album was taken on tour. The previous album (Just Testing, 1980) was much better. Don't waste your money here unless you are a die-hard Ash collector."
5,Great!,I was surprised by how fast I received this item in the mail. It works great and I love to work out to it!
5,my fav i use this video more then any other,Its fun and good music. great workout makes you smile and by the end i believe what he says that you shined today :). my kids even try doing the video with me to. in fact i used this video today earlier.
1,Blast off,"I was so excited when I received the tape ...then NOTHING and I mean NOTHING but static was on the VCR tape. I looked for a phone # to call--- NONE.I wanted to return it but the policy was it must be UNOPENED. really! How would I have known this was not good if I didn't open it. Problem was I bought this from an indipendant source not Richard Simmons Site. BIG,BIG rip off."
5,Great Workout,I had a copy of this that got damaged by my vcr so I was happy to find this available. I love it on days that I only have time (or energy) for a quick 20 minute workout. It is an easy routine to follow and the songs are original and very motivating. As usual Richard is full of energy and encouraging. I would reccommend this to anyone at any fitness level.
5,More fun....,"If you like to dance while you work out this will do it. I did not like it as much as the earlier ones; nonetheless, it still had value. Things went to quickly for me. It seems that the producers wanted to update the style and they lost me in the translation. It was fine the way it was."
5,BLAST OFF! by Richard Simmons,The tape was brand new.A very reasonable price and the service was quick!They said 6-21 days for shipping I had it in 4...Awesome
1,I CANNOT WATCH HIM WHILE TRYING TO WORK OUT,"He's a little too jumpy for me. I know working out is supposed to be a happy time, but Richard is a little too happy for me."
5,The essential art book-easy to follow and well illustrated!,"I have had my highschool art students use Design Basics in conjunction with my highschool introductory art courses for over ten years. It is a staple in my students' art theory reading. The book focuses on the elements and principles of design and organizes it's chapters as such. All information is correlated with artwork examples that run throughout the ages of art, from the prehistoric to the modern day. Many colour illustrations make for artistic ""eye candy""."
4,Basically good,"Nothing tremendously fancy, but covers large amount of material in a reasonably interesting way. Used as part of an Art Appreciation course."
2,Hyper-glorified and shallow,"If you're tempted to buy this hugely expensive book (for an over-sized, unwieldy paperback printed on medium-quality paper), think again.Let me complement the book description for you: Each concept is VERY superficially presented in a full two- or four-page spread illustrated with pictures of works of art that are NOT examined in an enlightening way. The book is basically a long list of design principles so shallowly presented that it's just that: a list.If a competent teacher were to transform this book into a slide show and orally explore each principle, it would probably make good material for three or four classes."
4,good,"It is a used book. although have some stains, but it still usable.Fine experience. It is a good book to read.Thanks."
3,Design Book,"This book was posted as ""New"" but it did not look new. The cover is rubbed and has some bends. The content feels dated. I bought this book to help me with my design/drawing class. I don't know if I want to keep it. Too much black and white."
5,Really great!!!,"I purchased a lot of Haba toys, even more of the marble run toys.All their products are super high quality, and super fun for my2 and a half year old son. I purchased this one a few months agoand my son absolutely loves it, and plays with it all the time, allhis friends, and mommies of his friends love it too. Everyone wants toget one after they see their kids wrapped up with it for long periods oftime. I love toys that are fun and make kids smart, and that's what thistoy is and does. Kids have to use strategy to figure out where to put thered and blue pieces to make the marbles go where they want them to,not to mention my son uses his little cars on it as well. It's a really goodsized toy, I like toys that are bigger and hardy. I'm also happy that it's madein Europe and I don't have to worry about possible lead."
2,Boring!,"After reviews I read of this toy, I was sorely disappointed, especailly after the appx $60 price tag. We all played with it for about 1/2 hour on Christmas morning and then got completely bored. The concept seems great -- I always like toys that seem educational, adaptable, and high-quality. The quality is great -- very well-made. But after you find one or two ways for the marble to bounce down to the bottom, you're pretty much done. For WAY more fun with the same kind of concept, I recommend getting a marble race game with tubes and chutes that can be built and re-built with much more variety. Oh, well."
5,Live Shot by Charles Jaco,"""Live Shot"" by Charles Jaco is an absolutely addicting book. Just when I thought I would ""just finish this chapter"", I couldn't stop. I had to go on. The behind the scenes look at the relations and problems between the United States and Cuba is so real, you'll think you're in Havana. The scenario Jaco creates with Fidel Castro's ailing health is captivating. One double cross after the next, every mysterious death, will hook you into this international thriller.Great job Charles!"
3,Only for young elementary children,"I bought this for my son in 4th grade hoping he would find it very useful. However when he tried to look up the word ""reflect"" so he could see how to spell it, the word was not in this dictionary. For children in 1st or 2nd grade, this dictionary might be fine, but children in 3rd grade or higher will need a dictionery with more than 50,000 words. My search continues..."
3,it's ok...,"This dictionary is ok but I think I will have to purchase another one. The creators seem to have forgotten what words beginning readers/spellers learn. many common words that kindergarteners, first graders and second graders use are missing; especially compound words-though there is a list in the back of compound words without definitions. Often times root words are included but words that include the root word are not: ""add"" is defined but ""addition"" is not. The descriptions are simple for young readers to comprehend but extra text boxes detract from them. The book also seems have a ton of lists in the back. everything from types of clothing, colors, compound words, transportation, amounts, opposites, foods. all without any definitions. I will say it has a nice intro on how to use a dictionary and how to look up words.All in all this is a good dictionary. It just isn't good enough to be my child's only dictionary."
4,What does____mean?,Purchased for grandson who frequently ask what words meant. It is a nice dictionary for children.
2,Not that bad...Yet not that Great,"I read her other book Surviving Mr. Right and I loved it.....However, Loose Lips failed to hold my interest. I am an avid reader and no one appreciates a good book more that I do. I just felt like there could have been more to this book."
3,"Not all I expected, but still enjoyable...","Initially, after watching this movie I fell in love with the music. However, I was quite disappointed that a few songs I had fallen in love with were not on the soundtrack. All in all, this is a decent soundtrack, but honestly, I almost wish I had saved the money for something better. This CD helped me discover Anna Nalick's ""Breathe,"" a very beautiful song and Aqualung's ""Brighter Than Sunshine"" so for that... 3 stars..."
3,something's missing!,"I love the movie!!!! i can watch every day and still laughing!! i just wanted to hear Ashton singing ""I'll be there for you"". so sad. but the other songs are very good. to remember the movie and laugh again."
4,A-L-L Soundtrack,"I purchased this soundtrack as a result from watching the movie, over & over again. If you like the movie you'll love the soundtrack."
2,kinda bland,"This is a mediocre soundtrack. I should have expected that, since it was a very mainstream-appeal movie. But it's definitely got some bright spots."
3,Bon Jovi???,Why is Bon Jovi's song not on the soundtrack!!????? Ashton sings a song from him and Bon Jovi is brought up so many times in the movie that I would think the song would be on there. What a disappointment!
3,Where is it?,Why is Bon Jovi Not on this soundtrack???They only mention Bon Jovi like 100 times during the flick and Kutcher even sings one of his songs. What is the deal??
2,don't buy it,"why on earth would they have this book written in two languages? No where in the product description did I see that this book is half german/ half english, which is ridiculous when you are forced to search for the english words on the page, not to mention the font is quite difficult to read which makes it even worse. The content is quite nice as the other reviews suggest but half the book is essentially a waste of paper. There's a pretty simple solution to make this better, MAKE TWO SEPARATE books with singular languages."
2,Mouse & Twink - 'Out Of The Pink Into The Blues' (HTD Records),"More or less, a cheesy compilation that my guess is that this CD was NOT released with Twink's approval. Too many lame-sounding covers. Jimi Hendrix's ""Red House"", J.J.Cale's ""Youngblood"", Santana's ""Oye Come Va"", Big Joe Turner's ""Kansas City"", the Stone's ""Midnight Rambler"" among others. Really nice cover, though. Unless you're like a total Twink / Pink Fairies / Pretty Things completist, you just might want to avoid this disc altogether."
3,Atlantic SPSCUR47 Satellite Speaker Stands,"Pros: very economical (good price), easy to assemble, good looking, sturdy.Cons: The base plate for holding a speaker is too small. I have Infinity satellite speakers which are very little. However, I have to put a hook at the speaker so it won't slide out from the base plate."
5,Almost perfect,"I already had one pair of these that I bought from a local store. Unfortunately, they did not still have them available when I went looking for a second pair. Luckily I found them here. The only thing I was a little disappointed at was that the color wasn't quite right. The silver was too bright and the black was too dark. Other than that it was great."
5,great stands,"for the price and quality, these stands are perfect. The onlyflaw which is not really a flaw at all are the assembly instructions.I would advise you to put the wires through the stand first and thenproceed.."
5,good item,The PRICE was a good value and I would recommend them . The speaker shelf is good for small speaker.
3,"Okay, but not awesome.","I bought these for the Polk Audio 6750 satellite speaker set. They mostly work together, but the bracket on the stand doesn't sit flush with the back of the speakers. This is not a stand flaw, I just thought I'd mention it since it seems to be a popular combination. You can still secure the speaker, but it's not a perfect fit.My biggest complaint about this speaker stand set is the brace that allows you to adjust the height. A WORD OF CAUTION - do not twist them too tightly! I wanted to make sure the speakers weren't going to crash to the floor, so I tightened them as much as I could. There's no end point to how far you can twist them, as I discovered. One of the plastic braces cracked. I didn't return the set though, as I only really needed one stand. When I adjusted the second one, I proceeded much more slowly and was able to avoid breakage."
1,Don't work with Onkyo speakers,"Sad to say that they don't work with Onkyo speakers. If they could be rigged to attach to the back of the satellite speaker (where there is a hole) it would be fine. But, they expect you to perch the speaker atop the stand. No can do, as the speaker has a crescent shape, and does not have an anchor hole. So, I shipped them back. Just a heads-up, as you'll end up paying the freight to return them like I did. Hope this helps."
5,Great Speaker Stands,"I think these stands are great. Very stable and good looking. Getting the speaker wire through the column and then connecting to the speakers is kinda tricky and tedious but once it's done, it's done. I was able to use one of two screws that came with the stands to securely mount the speaker to the stand. If you don't have a screw hole in the back of your speaker for mounting, you can use some of the included sticky material. Very impressed with the stands."
1,Difficult and Deceptive,"The color in the picture matches my TV bezel and TV stand PERFECTLY. However, the item that actually ships is black, with a rough matte finish. If I had known this, I would have saved $6 and ordered the one that says black in the description. There cannot be much of a noticeable or appreciable difference.Additionally, they were extremely difficult to attach to the speakers. This appears to be common. The attachment options are anything but standard. Be prepared to go to the hardware store and try to develop a makeshift option.Additionally, the feet are very large, and awkward to position."
1,Adjusting knobs are too easily stripped.,These speaker stands look really nice and are easy to put together. However you have to be very careful using the stands because one broke with less pressure than I would have used screwing in a light-bulb. I would advise anyone to buy a more sturdy pair of stands.
1,Would be better if they worked!!!!,The speaker stands are very nice BUT even though the stands description specified that they will work with ANY Samsung speaker system THEY did not. I had to jerry-rig the whole thing which did not make me none to happy!!!
1,Not worth it,"the poles arent straight , the pole screws into base which one wouldnt go in and when it did it went in crooked, and the other went in no problems but is tilted a little making both stands look way crooked and embarrassing when people see it!"
5,fits the spot,"Bought these for new sound system in small room , They work well as fit decor and space. No problems. Good price"
4,SPEAKER STANDS,SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. HAD TO FIGURE HOW TO MOUNT SPEAKERS ONTO STANDS ; GOT IT DONE BY REMOVING TOP PLATE
3,I like the ones that weren't broken,"The order arrived from Ritz Cameras in a timely manner. The package was tightly wrapped (I had two sets of stands on the same order-two boxes). One base in one of the boxes was broken in half. Hard to believe since it is a cast metal. I am currently jockying with Ritz Customer Service for a refund and they have been quick to return my emails. I'll update this if there is a problem. As for the stands, I am very pleased with the quality and design. I have mounted Polk Audio RM6750's to them. My wife's finds the stands unobtrusive as well."
5,great sound on a solid base,what a difference putting my speakers on these stands - now I have true surround sound! They're easy to put together and are very stable - worth every dime.
2,"Best Price,good quality but suitable for speakers with flat base/rear",I was impressed with the quality and ease of assembly but unfortunately it did not suit my speakers(POLK TL1600).My speakers has a curved rear and the base had three small rubber pods.This product is suitable for speakers with a flat base and flat rear face.
3,"Good for smaller speakers, not for larger speakers","I was going to use these to mount Polk Monitor 40 speakers. The speakers are way too big for these to support them. The plate to support a speaker is too small, and could only hold smaller monitor speakers. The ""kit"" includes double sided tape to adhere a speaker to the stand if it wont fit. I dont feel comfortable using that, and I dont want to drill into my speaker cabinet. I am going to keep these and see if I can modify them somehow to get them to work. The other issue is the collar that makes them adjustable. It seems pretty cheap, and doesn't seem to really lock the height that well. If you need a speaker stand that is very secure, maybe look elsewhere, unless using a small satellite speaker."
4,Tehy work fine,"While the stands aren't the same color as on Amazon, they are easy to assemble, and seem pretty sturdy and well made. Excellent stands for the price."
1,Poor Quality!,I have have other similar stands before and these are junk!! One of the stands fell apart while I was assembling it! Stay far away from these stands. I learned my lesson (again) - buy on quality not on price!!!
3,Cheap but decent for price,"I bought a set of 4 of these for my home theater system and overall they are decent. Unfortunately one of them came completely broken and was thus unusable. Another one of the four was slightly broken, but I was able to adapt it to fit my system. I ended up having to put the 4th satellite speaker on a bookshelf because of the broken stand. For 30 bucks its worth it, but don't think you are getting a superior quality of product. Also the mounting brackets were pretty poor quality but this also might be because I was trying to mount Mirage nanoset speakers which are slightly atypical in shape. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend these stands but they will get the job done."
5,Perfect Stands for my Sony Speakers,"I just received my Atlantic speaker stands this afternoon. Looks and works great with my Sony BDV-E570 surround speakers. Everything arrived in perfect condition. The instructions were very easy to follow. Thanks to some other reviews, I made sure not to overtighten the adjustment knob for the stand's extension or risk cracking it and took the time to screw the poles to the stands carefully to avoid stripping the treads. The small set of screws fit the screw hole in the back of the speakers perfectly. The speakers fit well with the L shape bracket, but because I wanted a near ""perfect"" fit, I used a hacksaw and shorten the bracket by a 1/4"". The fit, finish, looks and overall quality of this stand is well worth the price. Before buying I checked on-line and visited the big box stores and these were the best for my speakers; especially how the mounting bracket is designed. Very happy with my purchase."
3,Broken Base,"This product is OK, BUT... One of the bases for it arrived broken in such a way as to be useless. It appears I have to send the whole thing back to get the ONE part I need, which is very annoying. I'm not sure if it was broken from the manufacturer or in shipment from Amazon.Overall the product seems pretty durable, it looks nice and it assembles easily. So, for the price it's not a bad deal."
3,Will not fir Klipsch Quintet,I bought these stands for my klipsch Quintet speakers. Quintet speakers have a curvy bottom so they are not right choice for QUINTET.Apart from that stands look good.
3,"Well constructed, but....","I bought these for my Energy Take Classic speaker system, based on some positive reviews from some other reviews on this site. The speaker stands are solidly built, blend nice with the room decor, and easy to put together. However, I found them to be a bit too restrictive to hold my Energy satellite speakers. I had to mount them upside down so that I could use the threaded insert on the back of the speakers for attachment to the speaker stands, because the bracket used by the Atlantic speaker stands doesn't come up high enough to attach to the threaded insert with the speakers right-side-up. It works this way, just not the best or as polished of a setup as I would like. It would be a much better product if the bracket used to attach the speaker was some sort of clamp that attached to the sides of the speakers that could be tighted to keep the speaker stable on the stand. Still, not bad for the money."
4,Does the Job,Exactly what I was expecting when I received them. Setup was a breeze. Very functional for my rear speakers (small speakers from the klipsch HD 500 set). Minus 1 star because the stands made my speakers appear to be leaning forward on the stand. Had to bend the back bracket to make them appear straight. I would recommend for the price for a quick easy solution.
2,(Unusual) Bad experience,"It seems that the average experience with these stands is that they work just fine. However, in the interest of fairness: we had a different experience. We tried two sets (unable to replace the second set because the product is out of stock), and both sets were defective. You see, the support pole attaches to the base with a screw-thread design (the base is threaded to allow the pole to screw on). On 1 stand of each set, the threading was inadequate to support the weight of the pole. Rather than stand straight up, the support pole would lean over/wobble when you moved it. It would rest at about 70 degrees from horizontal (looked messed up). I didn't take the time to attach speakers to either set."
5,great product,i just set up a pair of these for my energy rc micro speakers ..for the rears..anyway... the reviews were right on target with these... 5 stars all the way ... hold my under 2 lb speakers great..adjust up & down perfect... just ordered 2 more pairs off amazon for my buddy with the same speakers... great product.. look nice in the black... very pleased.. thanks amazon...
3,Pretty good for the price !,"I would have given this 4 stars, but one of the stands does not sit tight to the base and I had to use plastic cover in the grove while i fit it to make it tight, & be careful with the height adjustor knob in the middle and don't rotate it too tight as I am not able to release it now for the same stand which does not fit to the base properly.Might be,I just got one stand where the grooving wasn't good, so would say its a decent product for the price you pay if you wont be adjusting heights & playing with it everyday after its been fitted !! ;)Almost forgot! Mine are BOSE acoustimass 6 speakers and fits pretty good onto these stands."
3,Ok for the price,"I bought these stands to hold Energy Take Classic 5.1 speakers, which are small, but still too large to be screwed onto these stands. I used the included double sided tape, which works. One of the stands is sort of crooked, but not too noticeable. Overall these are good for the price paid, but could have been better."
3,Acceptable quality--great price,"As others have noted, price can't be beat. Of two pairs I bought, one had serious thread tapping problem for the speaker bracket plate and one gave me a heart flutter screwing the pole into the base plate--their thread cuts could be a bit cleaner. The finish on the metal poles seems ""fragile."" Fortunately, I don't intend to handle them much. At full extension, they seemed plenty sturdy to handle my 3-4 pound speakers. They don't look bad, they're functional, and inexpensive--good enough. Recommended; just be careful when screwing things together."
4,SIMPLICITY,"These speaker stands fit the bill. They are priced right, good quality, and stable on carpet. No reason to pay 2x or 3x at the superstores."
3,Good Enough,"Sturdy stand... nice look, adjustable height and very easy to install. It is very good for its price.I have them for about 4 months now and I don't have any complaints."
2,50% Good,"I ordered these because they were cheap. So, it is not surprising that one pole that screws into the base, one of the stands, was incorrect. The base was tapped for a larger hole that the pole was threaded for.The other one works just fine."
2,Poor Construction,"These stands were a joke to put together. The main tubes wouldn't thread in properly. The threaded hole was too large and the tube would move side to side once in place,(wouldn't tighten). The adjustable tube also wouldn't tighten down without side to side movement. And the compression collar had to be glued on to keep it from spinning freely. Other than that its Super. If you don't mind repairing your new stands right out of the box then snap em up."
4,"Looks good, well made, mounting may not be optimal for some speakers","They look good and are well made. The mounting may not be optimal for some speakers. I am using them with Logitech Z-5450 rear surround speakers. They are wireless with permanently-attacher power cords, so I can't feed the cord through the stem of the stands. The mounting options are also not appropriate, but the base of the speaker sits fairly nicely on the stand's bracket, so I just hold it to it with tie-wraps."
4,Great for the money,"I bought these to compliment a Sony 2.1 Dream System. The Dream System was awful but these speaker stands fit it well. The only problem you might experience is that proprietary speaker wires from Sony, Bose or others have large connections that will not fit thru the stands...way too large, but if you have screw in speaker mounts it works well and also with larger speakers. I ended up using industrial strength velcro with my Phillips speakers as the speaker had no mounting screws....very flexible if you will be creative and customize. Sturdy and ajustable...Happy with the results. Saved good Bucks on this."
2,These are not SILVER!!,These stands are not silver in color. They have a dull gray color.The picture is misleading indeed!
2,Cheap,Cheap but you get what you paid for I guess...The black part on the bottom is not of the highest quality...but nonetheless I am keeping this product as it does the job...
5,Very nice stands,The stands are fine. I mounted some Cambridge Soundworks surround speakers on the stands with no problems. The stands are stable and adjust to different listening heights quickly.I have changed this post and rating. The shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order.
5,"I love these speakers, very powerful",Still have these speakers after a very long time and love them.I enjoy a special sound effect and how powerful they are for such a small size.Will order mroe from this company.
2,Speaker stand broken when received,One speaker stand was broken upon receipt. Tried to return only the broken speaker stand for a replacement. Found Ritz on-line customer service difficult to work with - would not answer specific questions with specific answers - only sent pre-formatted responses. Ritz finally directed me to return entire shipment for refund/replacement. After further emails they said just keep the stands and refunded my payment. I will not purchanse from Ritz on-line again. The unbroken stand works fine.
3,godd price for above average sound,One cannot complain too much at this price however next time I think i would look for better product
2,NO SPEAKERS INCLUDED,"It should say that in big, bold letters in the description of this thing, since the picture shows speakers attached!"
5,Very good.,"They are easy to assemble. Although the specs say that the stand can hold speakers weighing 2 pounds, they hold my speakers which may be around 4lbs. Only thing is they are not black but light gray. But hey, as long as they are functionally good, you can bear with the gray look"
4,Atlantic sat speaker stands,"Had to modify a bit with a bracket on the back of speakers to hold in place, the tape that comes with these units failed often. A small bracket placed on back through wire loop took care of the problem. These stands look fantastic so you can't go wrong if you want something nuvo and inconspicuous."
4,Very Nice Stands For A Nice Price,I normaly do not do reviews but I just wanted to say that I am very happy with the stands and how they how they look . They worked great for me and I will be buying another set for my front speakers
4,Excellent Price,"Compared to the big box stores, such as Best Buy, who want to charge you over $100 for speaker stands, these are a steal. They were easy to setup, and it took a little fanagling with my Sony speakers, but everythign was setup in no time flat. The nice part it is if I get new speakers that need to be attached anouther besides a screw from the back, I have other options. I know some people are concerned about the sturdiness, and having them on top of carpetting, my cats haven't knocked them down yet!"
4,Bang for the buck :-),"We still ordered these stands knowing our speakers didn't have the screw holes needed to securely mount, but this was nothing a black zip-tie couldn't handle. Lightweight, sturdy and extremely simple to assemble. Hubby couldn't be any happier. He especially loved the hidden wire option. I have a 4 yr.old who repeatedly bumps into it (purposely) and these stands give no sign of tipping over. Our rear speakers are small and measure about 2 3/4 in. across on the bottom and they sit perfectly on the platform. Also our speakers are only 5 in. tall and it was still able to conceal the slotted bracket so it still looks sharp. We literally shopped everywhere possible for speaker stands and these by far were best priced and nice looking. Minus one star just because it would have been nice if they provided an option for 'small, no screw speakers'. Still definitely recommend though if your willing to work with it a little."
5,Great Speaker Stands at a great price!,"Overall 4.5 stars. As always, great packaging from Amazon. The speaker stands look great and were super easy to install. I really like the adjustable height option and now has added some life to my whole entertainment system. I bought these for the new system Onkyo Ht-s 3300, which look great by the way, however the bolts supplied were never used since the only way and most convenient way was to use the double sided tape. Although the double sided tape provided a very nice suction to the stand, to be completely perfect would be to have some sort of screw for the Onkyo speakers specifically. Overall, I highly recommend these stands to anyone!"
4,Will do what you need it too.,Super easy to put together. Wish the double sided tape (the route I decited to take)was a little bit better. Looks great in the living room.
3,Solid but not stable,"This product is solid and well built. Looks pretty nice too. However, these stands tip easily. The base is not wide enough to withstand any sideways force. As I was assembling the towers, my 1 year old son was able to push the tower over while sitting, using just his hand. Adding a speaker to the tower would make it less stable by shifting the center of gravity up. It is a good product if you are placing it in a spot where you have no fears of it being knocked over."
3,Not built for Klipsch speakers,"These stands are well made and look great.The only problem with the stands is the companies name plate was put on with bad adhesive, straight out of the box all 4 were pealing off. Unfortunately they are not for Klipsch as advertised. They are made for a flat botton speakers."
3,Not universal.,"These are great, heavy-duty stands that are easy to put together. However, they are not universal. I tried them with the Martin Logan MLT-2 speaker set, and this set of stands was not compatible. The MLT-2 uses a keyhole design, and the bracket on the stands does not go up high enough to mount the speakers. Unfortunately, this required me to use the included adhesive strips, as well as to use several strips of tape to hold the speakers in place.While nice quality stands, they are not truly ""universal."" I can't help but think how easy it would have been to have just included a longer bracket, for alternative speaker setups."
4,Decent Stands,"These stands are pretty sturdy and hold 5-6 pound speakers very well. The bottoms have a good weight and are stable on tile floor. Only thing was we had to create our own ""wire brackets"" to hold the speakers (due to top-mounting, commercial Bose speakers). Based on the included hardware it looks like these stands would be able mount a lot of different types without the extra fabrication. The stands are very pleasant to look at (got black to match the furniture) and you can't beat the price."
5,Good for the money,perfect for the price.SturdyHides the cablesBrackets are ok but not perfect if you have speakers with hole mount some mods need to be performedHeat shrink at the end of the cables make it look nice no color cables to come out of the back.
4,Good Stands,"I got these not too long ago for my Infinity rear satellite speakers and they're fine. Not a whole to say about speaker stands..Pros:Easy to set up, nice wire concealing, sturdy and heavyCons:The feet are a bit larger than I would think necessary and prohibit them from being placed in tight spots"
4,they are good but not for the logitech 5500z,"i bought a pair of them , they are decent , but be aware, they are not compatible with the logitech 5500z make sure they are copatible with your set of speakers."
4,Great item for a great price,These speaker stands and sleek and fairly easy to put together. The base is heavy enough that the stand remains sturdy. I am very happy with this purchase.
3,What happened to the price?,I bought a pair of these a month ago for $23 plus free shipping and now they are $38 plus free shipping. Why the price hike?
1,Cheap price and construction,"I should have gone with my gut feeling when I bought these stands, when I received them one was already broken (and properly labeled as broken...) I got a return that they sent out again to try to fool someone else. Stay away from these stands. Don't be fooled by the price or you may end up the fool."
4,Very nice looking and stable design,"I really like these stands. They look nice, have good weight at the bottom to keep things stable, and you can hide the cord inside the pole. The only reason I gave 4 stars was that the plates the speakers sit on is pretty small, and for unconventional or larger speaker enclosures, like the JBL Control series, they don't fit well. I had to modify the bracket slightly, but now everything is great. The adjustable height feature is very nice."
4,Great speaker stands for home theatre set up,"I would have given these stands 5 stars if they would have fit my Energy Take Classic speakers a little better. I suppose it's not the stand's fault. Like another review stated, you have to install your speaker upside down. No biggie. Sounds fine.* Fast assembly - about 10 min's per stand (incl. speaker/wire)* Stable on my hardwood floors - solid, moderately heavy base* Easily holds small surround sound speakers* Easily routes and hides speaker wire* Fully adjustable* Shipped in 3 business days via FedEx* 2 Stands are included in the box"
3,Just Okay,"This product is nice with the exception of the telescoping rod locking mechanism. It is made from cheap plastic. Unfortunatley, one of them was not a good fit and would not tighten on the rod. It ultimately broke while trying to make it work. Fortunately, I'm a handy guy and was able to acheive my objective."
4,Good for the price,Pros - Easy to assemble and great for the price.Cons - They have a little trouble securing my sony rear speakers in place. They are loose and wobbly from the design.
4,Nice Speaker Stands,Just got these and they take some assembling but takes less than 10 mins. If your speaker has a slot for a screw in the back you can screw it to the stand. They provide sticky tape to secure the speaker as well.I liked them so much I was going to get another set but I noticed the price has gone up $7 from a week. I don't know why Amazon did that.
2,Measure first!!!,"Overall, the product is fine. However, I am unable to use them because they did not fit my surround speakers. The hole for the screws to attach to the stand were too high for the brace. It would be helpful if the dimensions included the dimensions of the brace that attaches to the speaker. I am using a standard Polk RM10 surround sound 5/1 speaker set, and the hole for the screw is 5 1/2 "" from the base. The maximum height for the brace is about 4""."
3,Ok for the price,"These stands are solidly designed but the mounting options leave a lot to be desired. They expect you to drill into your speakers to mount them solidly, A bit of juryrigging can give you an ok result where things won't rattle around, but they really should have included a couple more options."
5,$30 something shipped? - Unreal price!,"What a bargain. Very well built and sturdy speaker stands. Out of all the options, this is the best deal. Don't hesitate!And yes, this is for a set!"
3,"Nice stands, but didn't fit my speakers","The stands were easy to assemble, however, our back speakers ended up being too heavy for the stands, so they were not suitable for us and had to return them."
2,returned. faulty threads,These were a bit of a hassle to assemble and the threads between the base and the stand stripped. No hassle return but overall a hassle. Will spend a bit more for the next set of stands.
2,Stripped threads!,"When I got this product and set it up I tried carefully screwing the stand on to the base. I managed to cross the threads on both stands while assembleing. That said, I was able to jam the stand into place and am using the stands for my surround sound system. Also, The way you are supposed to attach your speakers to the stand is a little ad hoc. I will use the double sticky tape provided, but am using a rubber band to hold my speakers in place for now. Overall this stand is functional, but not elegant. The threads stripping on the base was particularly disturbing to me."
4,"Good price, could be easier to set up",Good speaker stands for the price. Especially considering the cost of something similar at most stores. Make sure you put the speaker wire through the top. Going through the bottom it gets stuck on the inner tube. Seems a little harder to connect the speaker wire to the speakers than it should be but it only needs to be done once so it isn't a big deal.
4,Economy stands don't look cheap,"Speaker stands are only expected to do a few things.1. Hold the speaker at variable heights securely: this is done quite well if you are talking about a typical home theater satellite speaker. If you have a 5lb speaker buy a product designed for it. I have a question though: why did they not put the pole in the middle of the triangular base? Instead it is to the side, I have very thin carpet so it isn't much of an issue, but with longer carpet this stand is going to lean toward the heavier side.2. Look good: These stands have a simple design that looks good. The speaker wires are routed out of sight. Ironically the one thing wrong is that their own logo is inadequately glued to the stands. I bought two sets of stands and all the stands in both boxes had this problem. I just simply threw all the logos away, I like the stands better without.3. Be affordable: I couldn't find a comparable product in the same low price range."
4,Great set of speaker stands,I love these speaker stands. They are pretty heavy and fit my Yamaha speakers great. The screw to connect the stand to the speakers is a little long but not too bad. Great buy for the price.
4,Great Stands,"Sturdy construction, great price, and all the screws you need for whatever brand speaker you have."
4,Purchased for use with Onkyo HTS5300B rear speakers,"I purchased these stands after reading reviews from other users and because of their relatively low price. The stands were easy to assemble but like other users have stated, I have to use the double-sided tape option for my speakers. Overall I am pleased with the stands. I would give the stands 5 stars if I could have used the bracket option."
4,"Generally a very good value, but...","These speaker stands would have been perfect for the very affordable price but I couldn't quite allow them that rating due to the very delicate threading in the base part...be very careful when tightening these pieces because the flimsy threads are very fine and fit loosely and I'm convinced would be very easy to cross-thread and strip out. The lock ring is loose-fitting also and wants to come undone with any minor contact at all such as adjusting the height. The careless design in just this one area is puzzling to me however, since the stands otherwise are very well laid-out and functional.Don't get me wrong though...these little speaker stands are very much worth the money. Other than the above, they fit together well and--once they are adjusted and in place--look very nice, are sturdy and end up doing their job quite satisfactorily.I'd give a five-star rating were it not for the above-mentioned."
5,Good Product/Great Price,"These are a good, basic stand for a small speaker. The price was the lowest I found anywhere and I hit a free shipping promo that saves some money since this product is heavy.Setup was fairly easy, look at the diagram for no hassle installation."
4,"They work, what else is there?","I like em. They are nice enough to be in the decor' of the condo. They are small enough they blend in, in the corners of the room.. Easy to assemble, easy to attach to any speakers. I had to drill my speakers(Yamaha) but other than that, works great.. They don't tip, but I don't have them high up.. about 48in. and I have concrete floors.I gave it 4 stars because it took a week for amazon to ship after I ordered, but only 2 days to arrive once shipped. It was free, so I can't complain too much."
5,Works perfect with my Sony DAV-X1 Virtual Surround System,"This product gets 5 stars because it's only about $200 cheaper (that was before the increase to over $100 by Amazon - I paid only $33 with free shipping) than Sony's stands. The stands are sturdy and hold my Sony sattelite speakers securely. The stands themselves blend in nicely with my piano black Samsung 56"" HDTV. Pretty easy to secure the speakers to the stands as Atlantic provides two screw sizes and washers to attach your speakers to the stand.The only flaw I saw was that one of the padding on the base was falling off. I had to flatten out the padding and restick. A minor nuisance that I can live with given the price of these attractive stands."
2,These dont work with...,..old Aiwa HTiB speakers! they are leaning against the L shaped brackets and its very easy for them to fall over! cant seem any way to use the screws the back of the speakers!! so no good!
3,Nice and sturdy Speaker Stands. But......,"I bought the black stands. The stands themselves were easy to assemble and are very sturdy. However, the reason I gave them 3 stars and not 5 is that the speakers I had did not have the proper holes/hooks/hinges (Whatever you want to call them). So they did not sit properly on the stand. The stand was not very verstile so you may have issues with different types of speakers. In my case, I had to improvise to get them to stay on. I own a Samsug HTZ-310 speaker series."
5,Satellite Speaker Stands,"Great value-same quality as stands costing 3 times as much, very sturdy with heavy metal base, would recomend to anyone looking for a great set of stands at a low price (well worth the cost)"
5,Nice pair of stands..,"I got these for my logitec z5500 satellite speakers. Although its not perfect fit for it, they gave us an option of mounting the speaker through sticky tape. Works great so for."
3,fi,"Only way to attach the Onkyo speakers was with the double back foam tape that was provided. To me, this was a little shy of satisfactory. Other than that, they look good, are unobtrusive and have good height adjustment."
2,Atlantic Speaker Stands to not work with Onyko or Energy Speakers,"They are a good idea and attractive enough but there is no mounting holes to work with older Onkyo satellite speakers nor newer Energy 5.1 speakers except for serious double stick tape which I have on order. Since the platfrom is small, I fear small bumps to the speaker will rip them from the double stick tape. I will see shortly."
5,"Well designed, practical, and inexpensive","I would have to agree with the other positive reviews. I just installed these stands. They are solid and can easily support a typical bookshelf speaker. The only minor note is that they come with several mechanisms to attach the speaker to the stand, but these do not include what is probably a common solution, adapting to a wall hanging mount on the back of the speaker. This is a keyhole cutout. All it requires to attach this speaker to the stand is a screw and bolt, ideally a wing-nut type bolt. Seems like most other options were supplied, but this was not. No problem, however, as I found what I needed in the garage. For the price, this is an excellent product."
5,Great speaker stands at a great price!,"Really nice speaker stands for a fraction of the price of others. I highly recommend theses to anyone. Adjustable height, several speaker mounting options, solid construction."
1,Worst Stands to Date,I bought these for the Energy Take Classic speaker system and they in no way hold the speaker securely. I tried to clip the wire arm that holds them because they are about an inch and a half too long and the result is an insecure stand that resorts to using double sided tape. DON'T BUY THESE!!
3,Great for Square Speakers,"Product works but isn't great for rounded speakers. They are not very secure, but does the job. Not worth the shipping to return, but wouldn't buy again for round speakers."
5,Excellent stands,"Heavy duty, hold my heavy surround speakers without issue. Brackets did not work for my speakers, but I simply centered the weight on the stand and attached via a velcro pad that covers the entire top plat and that holds my heavy speakers fine. The cord goes through the stand and directly through the floor to the basement and to my receiver. No wires, and great sound. Thanks!"
3,They are Ok,"Probably just the type of speaker I have but they don't sit flush in the mounts and are actually tilted up a little bit due to the design, other than that they do what they are supposed to do and the adjustable height is clutch in getting your sound dialed in."
2,"Look nice in the box, but then...","Had high hopes for these -- reviewers liked them, and they looked handsome out of the box. But the enjoyment thinned out quickly. I bought two pairs. In the first, I couldn't tighten one pole's height adjustment, and found a plastic friction fit inside the height knob had cracked. The other pole of the pair slanted slightly off the vertical, which made the stand look cheap. In the second pair, one pole could not be tightened in the base -- it spun around; the threads didn't engage.These might be pretty good value if you're lucky enough to get a quality pair; I threw the dice and lost twice."
4,Wish I could Rate 4.5 Stars...Almost Perfect,"These are fantastic speaker stands, I purchased a pair for my front Speakers and loved them, the only gripe is the adjustments to get your speaker to sit in the frame at the top is not the best design and does not allow my speakers to sit completely flush with the frame, however that did not stop me from ordering a 2nd pair yesterday for my surround speakers. I bought the first pair for around $30 and when I went back to get another pair they had gone up in price significantly so I waited until they dropped to $27 before buying them again."
3,"They work, disappointed about the mounting","These speaker stands do what they are supposed to, the only issue I have is that the mounting is pretty much ""figure it out yourself"" style. It comes with some sticky tape and a few machine screws that are supposed to be some sort of ""standard."" The instructions say that you can use wood screws but the stands don't come with any.Overall, I got the speakers mounted but I'm not happy with how I had to do it."
3,Good price but bad choice if wanting to use banana plugs and 12 gauge wire,They do the job but with the definitive technology speakers I'm unable to use banana plugs because the bracket is too close. Also using 12 gauge wire is not recommended since there is not enough clearance. 14 gauge would work better.
4,Good,Serves the purpose perfectly.more meant for smaller satellite speakers. Mine is a little bigger and hopefully the screws at the bottom will hold it.looks good. height adjustment is perfect
3,nonsensical mounting hardware,"I don't understand rave reviews of these, from people who presumably have actually mounted speakers to them. Yes, they are fairly stable and adjustable, but what about that mounting hardware? There are at least a dozen other ways it could have been designed, all better than what you get. As a consequence, it is very difficult to mount most satellite speakers to them, and since that is what these are usually used for...Most mounting options, if used, would make the mounting link weak, risking damage to the speakers. Also, mounting screws for wood are absent. Barely adequate, in my view."
5,Awesome Stands That Won't Cost a Fortune,"I have my Logitech Z5500 front satellite speakers mounted on these stands and they look killer. The speaker wire can be hidden within the extendable rod. They won't hold a huge speaker, but most satellites should be adaptable. Included hardware was sufficient for me to mount my satellites. Everyone that sees my setup asks where did I get the speaker stands."
4,Good product for the price.,"Bought these stands for my new Samsung home theater system rear speakers. The design is good, it's very sturdy and well built. The only fault (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stairs) is because it wasn't totally compatible with the Samsung speakers. The speakers are rounded at the bottom so they don't fit snugly with the stand. Nonetheless, the bolts are enough to hold everything together."
4,Satellite speaker stands,The Atlantic speaker stands provided me with exactly what I was looking for they are very solid and heavy enough so as to not get knocked over easy and simple to put together I would give them a A for price and B+ for product.
5,"Easy, to put together, PERRRFECT","These look great. They are sturdy. Easy to mount my Bose satellites.Awesome. Get them,compliment most any space.Very Nice.Hide cords easily."
5,Speaker Stands Work Well,"These stands are sturdy, it was easy to thread the speaker wire through the stand. The stands adjust easily, I've had them for several years without any issues."
4,Worth the price.,"Pros:Heavy stable base, solid construction.Well designed, adjustable speaker mounts.Speaker cords are hidden in the stand.Plenty of spare parts.Easy assembly.PRICE!Cons:""Atlantic"" logos were misaligned in the stamped base. No biggee, I removed them.My surround speakers do not have a square base (Polk Audio RM705) and the mounting screw is on the bottom. They still mounted easily to the base."
3,Very Nice,"For the price these are great speaker stands. Fairly easy to set up, good looking and adaptable to various speaker types. My speakers (small surround sound in a box rear satellites) didn't actually fit any of the options to secure to the stands, but I was easily able to come up with a solution because of all the options and extra hardware. I'd give these an A-, only because they could have been a little easier to assemble."
2,Buyer Beware!!,"I ordered these because I needed a speaker stand for my front two speakers. When they came in the mail, and I opened the package, I was very disappointed. The left stand was welded on crooked. Also, the stickers of the brand do not stick all the way on. I now have my speakers set up, after about an hour of assembly, and they don't look right, especially the left one. It is obviously crooked by the way the speaker is uneven. I am very upset. I would return it, but I threw away the box. Looks like when I buy speaker stands in the future, it's going to be somewhere in my neighborhood, instead of Amazon."
2,they work but are not perfectly straight,THe main problem i have with these stands are the fact that the mounting plates the speakers sit on are not welded level! I had to use the foam tape in the box to build up the sides that were low to try and level the speakers out.
5,Quality stands,These stands are exactly what we were looking at in an electronics store for half the price. Works great with the speaker system we picked up at Fry's.
3,"They are OK, i guess.","I ordered the Titanium stands and received the black stands. I dont really mind what color they are, but i wish they could have gotten the order right. One of the stands assembled pretty good, but the other one did not screw in correctly. The threads on the base are not machined right. I cannot screw the speaker post into the base without it floppin from side to side. My rear spakers are small Sony speakers so i am not too worried about them tipping over.For the price these are just OK. I plan on keeping them because they do work for my needs. I do not think i would recommend these stands. You get what you pay for."
3,easy setup and great looking,This product takes 10 minutes to setup 4. It is super easy. Very easy on the eyes. It makes the room look like you have a sound system. I used my simple SONY HTIB.The product is stong on the bottom so it's not going to tilt over. The extension part is a bit weak. I have it fully extended as I guess most people would like them. The product because to lose strength and stand a bit off centered. It leans to a side. I wouldn't return them! Just keep in mind that they are a great value and look great. Just has a clumsy feel to it. I tighten them every week when i see them leaning too much.
4,works well,"I have my Sony surround speakers on it and the fit and installation was fairly easy. It is true as other reviewers have written that if the media one is playing does not have surround sound on it nothing will come out of the surround speakers.I changed the configuration of the speakers in my Sony receiver to all front, so even if I am playing media with no surround sound I still hear the audio from the surround speakers."
3,I'ts ok at the price.,I'ts a bit difficult to secure the speaker to the stand properly.I have Polk Audio Speakers.The stand itsself is great.
4,VERY PLEASED,"For the price this was a very good deal. I,ve seen other reviews that said it was hard to assemble. If you have any itelligence you can figure this out without instructions. Every thing fit well with my system and I didn't have to drill holes or anything. It is just your basic stand and pretty well balanced."
4,"Great price, good product","These stands are very affordable, and that was what caught my eye. However they are surprisingly attractive, and well built (for the price). I'm definitely happy with them and will probably buy two more.The only down side was the lack of good documentation for setup, and the bracket to support the speakers is cheap and didn't really fit my speakers. I found a way to make it work though, and anyone with a little ingenuity can do the same."
5,Cube speaker stand,This is better than Bose stand in my opinon because it has a support plate where speaker can sit.
4,great stand,"just bought for my logitech speakers. Very easy to install but unfortunately not all type of satellite speakers are easy to fit with. For my logitech, I just use double-side tapes and tied with cable ties. Adjustments are easy. the surface (if you touch it) is not really smooth. But, overall, it's good enough for me."
3,Returned due to limited mounting options for Energy Take Classic,I bought these for my new Energy Take Classic speakers. The three options for mounting speakers did not work with them. L-shaped clip is too short to mount the speakers with. I don't like the bottom mounting option with tape since the speakers would be taped off center and will fall off the stands. I returned them and bought a Sanus HTB3. The Sanus ones are not as attractive looking and are shorter but did offer a lot more mounting options than the Atlantic stands. Sanus stands tend to have more mounting options including Quickmount for mounting through the key hole...
5,Could not ask for better!,I recently purchased one the sets and I really do like it! There are many options that it gives you to attach the speakers! I found the instructions to be easy and great! I purchased the Logitech Z-5450 Digital 5.1 Speaker System and used the adhesive Tape that was provided. (Tip: If you have the same pair it just best to remove the mounts that are provided.) They give you several options and are compatable! I was going to use wall mounts provided with my speaker system but why mess up my walls! So I just purchased another pair! 50 bucks for 4 stands! That is not a bad deal for the crazy amount of money that people ask for in the first place!
3,"Just ""ok""...","The cast iron is easily scratched. I purchased 4 (2 pair) and all but 1 came out of the box with dings and scratches...the boxes themselves do not look to have suffered from shipping, so I can only imagine that the damage was done in packaging, etc. at the factory.Assembly is easy, included instructions are clearly written.They will certainly do the job as intended."
4,Great buy,"These stands are great. They look good and the bases are heavy enough that they are very sturdy. The one problem was that the screws to mount the back of the speakers were too long so i had to spend 50 cents at the hardware store for new ones.I don't know why you would spend hundreds of dollars for speaker stands, these are awesome."
5,Nice deal!,"After looking through overpriced speaker stands I was happy to find these reasonably priced ones! Maybe a bit more unstable than others because of the base design but unless you have kids that are going to be attempting to push them over it's a non issue. I like having 2 mounting options (I went for the adhesive method which has been great) and also the speaker wire is hidden as it runs through the stand as it should. Great product, would definately buy again."
4,Good product! Atlantic Speaker Stands,"For the money, a great product. First set came broken, but exchange was easy and fairly quick (only 1 email questioning where the replacement set was!)Assembly was easy, construction seems sturdy. Stands are attactive and fit well with my Bose 3-2-1's using the double sticky tape provided. (The bracket really was ugly with my speakers, so I opted for the tape).You can't beat the quality of product for the price."
3,didn't fit well,"Speaker stands are ok, and fairly solid. The only problem i had is that my speakers are a little tall for the bracket provided. I have onkyo speakers that are about 10-12 inches high, but narrow. They have a metal insert in the back for the bolt from the speaker stand to attach to. The bracket that the bolt goes into doesn't extend far enough up to reach the insert, and was of no use. I had to drill holes in the bottom of the speaker and put two small screws in to attach them to the stand. Some two sided tape was provided, but i didn't feel it was strong enough, especially since some of it was no longer sticky. They look fine, but wish the brackets were longer - I don't like drilling holes in my speakers."
4,Works for me.,"Easy to assemble and they seem sturdy and stable enough. The top, vertical bracket is made of heavy rod/wire stock and is just a little bit obstinate to work with. We got two sets for the two pairs of satellite speakers."
5,Easy installation and looks good.,Installation is really easy...don't even need to read the instruction. They look good and does the job of holding up my small satellite speakers. Like that the wires are hidden.
4,Adequate,"These speakers stands are sturdy, easy to assemble and are quite stable. I bought them for use with small speakers in a Samsung home theater system. The stands adjust height easily and adapt easily to a wide variety of speakers. Styling leaves a little to be desired but the functionality is great."
5,Sturdy Great product,I was a bit skeptical with these stands. I figured they would be toppled over by a roaming/running/jumping cat chase but after a year and a half these have stood up to the test. I like the minimal profile and the wire channel worked well for my needs. My speakers are about the size in the product photo and the stands sit on carpet.
3,stands,"My samsung surroundsound speakers didn't fit on the stands, trying to string the speaker wire down the tube was a chore and the the upright poles don't even stand up straight, more like at an angle.I guess you get what you pay for"
5,Great product,This pair of speaker stands does not cost too much and still are sturdy and look good in my living room. I am using these to mount the rear speakers for my Sony home theatre system. I am glad I made this purchase.
3,Not very solid,"When fully extended the pole cannot be tightened enough to stay straight. I have very small surround speakers, so it's workable, but if you have large speakers I believe they would tip over. Would not buy again."
4,good product,"Given the fact that the stands are super cheap, I have no complaints whatsoever. They were completely compatible with my Denon satelite speakers and look great in my living room. The construction is solid and I am not worried about my dog knocking them over accidently. Overall, a great product at this price point."
5,great stands,Had no problem using these for my front speakers. The infinity speakers installed with no problems. The kit came with a few different ways to attached the speakers.
3,Poor construction,"The stands are functional, but the poles that screw into the bases are constructed incorrectly. One pole fit and screwed in fine. The other was threaded smaller than the hole, so it would simply slide in or screw down, but never tighten (acted like it was stripped). If I had paid more for these stands I would have gone through the trouble of returning them. I put some tape over the threads in an attempt to gain tightness, but the end result is not a tight fit and the pole is fine so long as you don't touch it. You may want to consider purchasing a more expensive set as I neglected to do, because of inadequate funds."
4,Speaker Stands,"These speaker stands I found elsewhere on the internet for $79+. To be frank, they aren't worth that much. But, they are well worth the twenty something price I paid at Amazon. Great product. Very well made and, good looking."
3,The speaker stand want work for certian Onkyo speaker system,"I was impress with the quality of the stands. They are sturdy and heavy, however the speaker stand would never support my Onkyo speakers. These speakers are surround sound and very long. The bracket want even come close to fitting on the back of these speakers.The instruction stated drill holes in your speakers. I had to read that twice, drill holes in speakers? A true music lover would never do that, lol.No complains about the speedy delivery or the quality of the product just doesn't fit my speaker system."
3,It's alright,"The back hook wasn't long enough to reach the keyhole of my speakers, so I had to be creative. It seems to have worked out though."
4,Nice stands,These stands look nice and are good quality. My speakers are rounded on the bottom so they might tilt a little sometimes but overall these are great stands for the price.
3,Speaker stands,They worked for my speakers but the speakers did not connect to the stands really well. Could have been a bit better but all in all I am happy.
4,Good Speaker stands,These stands are as expected and should do the job needed. Heavy enough and not too offensive looking when placed in the room for good speaker arrangement. Only issue experienced is the speaker mounting bolts are a skosh too long. Had to add a non-supplied washer to avoid bottoming out. A shorter screw would have accomplished the same thing.
5,Atlantic speaker stands,I bought these stands for my Bose double cube speakers. They are easy to assemble and the Bose speakers mounted to the stands easily. Great stands for the price.
4,Speaker stands,"Stands were just as described, were shipped fast. Look just like the ones we paid 3x as much for, several years ago. Very pleased with purchased."
3,"Well crafted, but with some limitations","I have read the largely positive reviews here and I agree with everyone that these speaker stands are well made and a bargain at the price here on Amazon. I bought these speaker stands to use with Polk RM6750 speakers and they worked OK, but not great. The two issues I had were:1. The bolts provided to attach the speaker to the stand were threaded poorly and did not work. It wasn't the speaker because I bought new bolts at Home Depot that worked fine.2. The second issue was that the gap in the bracket was incompatible with the 14 gauge speaker wire that I used. I was able to bend the bracket to get it to work, but just barely. This would not be an issue if you use 16 gauge or smaller speaker wire. I don't think you could make it work with 12 gauge or larger wire.They look nice and are easy to adjust. They are good stands for the price. Now that they are set up and the issues are in the past, I like them more."
5,great speaker stands!!!!,"i bought these stands for my onkyo 5100 system and they have worked great , easy to adjust the height, not the most discreet but they are durable and easy to put together, the speaker wire goes through the stand's base up to the top, u can either secure the speaker to the stand by screwing it to the bottom of the speaker or with the back brace provided"
5,Great value,I bought these speaker stands a couple of months ago and I really like them. Good quality and I like how small they are.
3,Not good for ONKYO 6300 satellites,The thread of the speaker where the screw needs to go in order to lock it in place is higher than the support. Therefore it can not lock the speaker without another tweak.
5,Good value,Good value and a versatile way to quickly set up a surround sound system without mounting speakers on ceilings and walls.
4,looks great but not good with my speakers,"These stands are very nice looking. The way all the pieces were laid out was very well done. But they don't support my samsung (ht-c5500) rear speakers. It does come with a bunch of ways to hold the speaker on the stand but the speakers I have has little feet on the bottom stand on the edge of the speaker stand. :( Right now, the speakers are sitting on it lop sided. I might sell the stand locally."
5,Great stands for cheap,"The speaker stands were easy to use. If you do need to bolt on your speaker as we did, you do have to purchase the porper size screw. Otherwise, very easy to put together, cheaper than other brands, and looks great."
3,Decent pair of stands for the price,Bought for Onkyo surround speakers.The Good -Solid construction (metal)Run the speaker wiring inside the standHeight adjustableThe Bad -The speaker mount (I used the adhesive tape that came with it) is not suitablefor all types of speakersWorth the money I paid for them.
4,Very happy with the practicality and price!!!,"Great speaker stands for the price! I was very impressed at how easy they assembled right out of the box.They also adapted well to my oversized Onkyo speakers, even though I had to mount them upside down to get the clamp to hold the speaker to the stand.I have lack of experience buying speaker stands but they were all that I expected and more.Two minor complaints was minor imperfections in the base under the powdercoat but they aren't noticeable unless you are looking very closely. The other issue was I wasn't able to get one of my speaker wires thru the stand but that may just require some finesse to correct the issue.Overall very good speaker stands; inobtrusive, easy to assemble, very cost effective.Only Cons: not very elegant, difficult to feed wire thru stand (if you are worried about hiding the wires)."
3,Decent Stands,These stands are well built but attaching your speaker is annoying. It kind of sort of holds them in place. They do the job well enough though and since they are not moved after initial setup it is fine. Decent Stands for a Decent price.
5,Best Buy,"Bought these stands after much research, was looking for a good stand at a fair price. These serve the purpose. Great stand , great price."
4,Good enough,"The stands do what they are meant to do, but are not the most stable of stands. It's still a good buy if you are looking for someone cheap that fits most stereo speakers."
4,Good Stands...great price,"Good quality at much lower price than many of the other stands out there.They were very easy to put together, with very clear instructions. It would have been nice if they offered a few more options for mounting, though.As an earlier poster said, I wasn't too keen on the idea of putting double sided tape on my small satellites, so I made a Home Depot trip for some wing nuts. They really should have included this additional hardware in the package, even if it meant a small increase in the price."
2,speakers Stands,I thought when the information stated grey it was a light grey not a dark grey.Also they look like steal poles! but I guess you get what you paid for...
3,Good Stands but one problem,These are good stands and have a clean look but one of the poles stripped in the base. A piece of tin foil worked as a quick fix.
2,Parales de baja calidad,"Compre estos parales para unas cornetas de mi home theather onkyo, esteticamente son bonitas, pero el para donde enrosca en la base no aprieta bien y queda un poco flojo."
3,Don't Use the Adhesive Strips Instead of Screws,"These are decent speaker stands, but don't be fooled into using the supplied adhesive strips instead of screws. When I tried the adhesive strips for a small set of speakers, the speakers came loose after a few minutes and fell on the floor, damaging one of them."
3,Wire Bracket is Too Short,"The product is well made, but they skimped on the wire bracket (C) height. I have a set of Infinity Speakers and these stands are not suited for them unless you wish to screw holes in the bottom of the speakers or use the double-backed tape. It is unfortunate that the idiots that designed the wire bracket (C) did not have enough brains to increase the height to at least 6"". It is only 4"" and will not work if your screw hole is higher than that The only way that these included wire brackets (C) will work is if you turn the speakers upside down and use a spacer, but who wants their speakers upside down anyway. I am going to have to make my own bracket or try to find a substitute in order to use the stands."
4,Klipsch quintet speakers,Cons - I had to tie my Klipsch speakers with a metal wire because apparently the holes of the speakers are not standard.Pros - The stands are sturdy and the height is adjustable.Go for it. It's a great buy and the price is very reasonable. I'm getting me another pair.
5,Great stands,These are some very sturdy stands. Heavy metal bases. I had no problems attaching my Bose 161 speakers to them.
5,Worked perfectly,"I have an Onkyo HT-S7200 7.1 surround speaker package. I purchased two packs of these Atlantic speaker stands. Easy to put together, and has a variety of options for mounting. Due to the large speaker size of the surround speakers, I had to use the double sided tape option. I'm surprised how well they hold the speakers in place. Very pleased and would highly recommend these to anyone not looking to break the bank on speaker stands."
5,Sturdy and Easy to Assemble!,"These stands are a great, inexpensive way to mount your speakers. They were super simple to assemble and are incredibly sturdy. The base is nice and solid and they never even come close to being tippy. The only thing was that the screws that came in the box didn't fit my Yamaha speakers, so I still need to get smaller ones - no biggie, though - they only cost about $.99.Great, solid product for an even greater price. Completely worth it!"
4,Pretty good...,"My Onkyo speakers did not sit locked well on the stand. I had to use my speaker wires to tie a knot on the back of the speaker stand so the speakers do not fall off. This is the only issue, other than that, the stands look good and stay standing firmly to the ground."
5,Quality,"Solid balance (very heavy base), excellent height options, easy to assemble, and classy looks.The speakers I am using only have keyhole hangers, which these stands do not accommodate, however, I was able to very securely mount the speakers using wood screws and the speaker stand's plate.Very high quality for the price."
3,"These do the job, but not all that well...","I bought 4 of these as an alternative to wall-mounting my speaker system. I have to say Iike them better than the wall mounts I had before, but the craftsmanship is not exactly exemplary. I have one stand that I simply cannot get to stand up straight. For the price, these units are acceptable, but I admit I expected more from them when I placed this order."
2,one works the other doesn't,"My fault is, the bottom of the speakers are round. But when putting the rod into the base of the stand it just turns and turns, one works the other doesn't. Both are rather shaky. Choose not to use the item."
4,Speaker stands,These are nice little stands. Much more sturdy than I expected. My speakers are Klipsch Quintet series and weigh about 6 lbs. These stands hold them with no problem but I had to rig them up because none of the adaptors work for them. For the price though I cannot complain. It would have cost twice as much to get the proper stands.
2,Not a fan of these...,These catch vent debris very well. The problem we had was that they blocked air flow a lot and made our AC work harder. We took them out...just not energy efficient in our opinion.
4,I guess they work?,"Mine have been in the vents for months now and I expected them to be dirty or something. Maybe my vents aren't especially dirty. I think they work because I can't see how anything would get through them, they are a tight weave."
3,Not sure if they work,"My wife bought these because the rental house we lived in was very dusty. We used expensive register vents too, but ultimately the solution was to move out of the rental house. My wife said these filters helped with her allergies...so I guess they work."
3,Filters ok,"I am sure these work well. Problem is they don't let the heat in the rooms you have the filters in so the rooms are so much colder. They work, you just have to be hot or cold."
2,Not sure if they work,"My vents were bigger than the filters so I had to use two of them, side by side. I did not notice a difference in the amount of dust and other particles in my room. The filters also blocks some of the air from the AC/heater which affects the temperature in my room."
4,Makes a good filter/cover for vents on my computer tower,"I just got a new computer tower and discovered that the top of the tower had a large vent section. Great for allowing air circulation to keep the computer cool but not so great in that it allows a lot of dust to get into the tower to muck things up. I got a package of these filters and have taped two together and taped them to the tower, covering the vent. They are keeping the dust out without obstructing airflow into the tower. I expect this package will last me quite some time since there are 12 filters. Although it doesn't say anything on the wrapper about washing and reusing these, I don't think it would be a problem to do so."
3,"Good product, but expensive.","These are nice items if you live in a dusty area, but a little costly for their value.I would look for them in a local store."
1,Utter nonsense.,"Rampaging feminism that bears no resemblance to any kind of reality, let alone this one. This novel puts forward literally no new ideas, and as it tries to do so succeeds at nothing but laugh-inducing ignorance. So perhaps my one-star rating is a tad too harsh, as there is quite a bit of unintentional fun to be had at Carter's expense. Read only if you enjoy self-mutilation and rather like the taste of bile rising in the back of your throat."
4,pampers baby wipes,The larger box of wipes are good because you dont run out as quickly. I would have gave it 5 stars but the only problem i have with these wipes are there a little on the thin side.
1,malisimoo,"Es con la unica cosa que he tenido problema, las compre hace un mes y no me han llegado, llame por telefono a target y me dijeronq ue mandara un e-mail, lo mande y me dijeron que no hablaban espanol, el chiste es que mis toallitas nunka llegaron y pague por ellas.."
2,Too Thin,These wipes were much thinner than I expected/remembered. I had to use at least 3 at a time. I won't buy these again.
