1,A complete disappointment,"It's tough to give this otherwise-just-mediocre book 1 star, but here's why: Storace's distaste for the modern Greek people is really obvious. She's a skilled writer, but the experiences she describes are unexciting and her ""insights"" on Greeks border on offensive. She obviously got nothing positive from the country where she spent a year. Too bad for her."
4,Living Mythology,"This book is an interesting juxtaposition of travelogue and mythology. As a child, Storace was fascinated with the stories and characters of Greek mythology. This led to a life-long fascination with Greece and Greeks, not only of the ancient culture, but as they are today. In this book, Storace takes us on a journey to her Greece, a land that is inseparable from its mythic past. She narrates to us stories of people she met in Greece, repeating the stories they told her, all the while relating the stories to the ancient tales from Greek mythology. As a travel journal, the book is a little heavy on allusions and symbolism and a little light on realistic imagery. But direct descriptions of events is not what this book is about-instead it is the personal story of how Storace finds meaning in Greek culture through her own integration of history, mythology and observation of contemporary society."
4,Capturing the Greek Heart,"Having just had a holiday in Greece, I found a kinship with Ms. Storace, even though my knowledge of the language and the history was not as in depth. Her sentences would turn into paragraphs, and sometimes I would have to re-read them to capture the thought. On the other hand, you just have to be a female traveling without a male escort, to relate to the flattering, yet agressive romantic notions of the Greek male. When I would explain that I was married, Greek men would reply:"" So? No big deal."" She was very accurate when she would write of these things! Reading the book made me want to travel back to Greece. I thought she captured the Greek heart well."
4,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed this book although there were times when I felt that the author was overwhelming me with a large amount of historical facts in each chapter. Sometimes I felt as if I had picked up a history book rather than a travel memoir. Unlike others, I didn't at all feel that she was condescending towards the Greeks...I think she was genuinly enamoured of the culture and country and was doing her best to explain why, in spite of all the internal problems prevalent in Greek society, she feels such an attraction for the place. I know I came away from the book with a new and deeper understanding of modern Greece and I look forward to seeing more prose by Patricia in the future."
2,"Cold, Unfinished Prose","I am only half way through the book, but I find Ms. Storace's writing stilted and her thoughts often seem to be unfinished. She has little imagination and conjurs no images of this place for me. I have yet to find any of her encounters, or descriptions of them, to be even mildly amusing and she seems obsessed with the Nation's religious zeal. What about the food? Where is the scenery? What about the people and family life? None of these things are explored beyond the most superficial glance.Very disappointing."
2,Spoiling the ship,"Ms. Storace's writing is vivid, frequently excellent. Her opportunity to spend a significant length of time in Greece is to be envied. Her extensive travels reflect a serious attempt to look at the landscape. The recurring theme of the dream-book is imaginative and very useful in linking an episodic book. Unfortunately, she condescends towards the Greeks, and sees them as dysfunctional -- largely because they aren't American. This imperialist attitude is more common to British writers, and always a little galling. Perhaps taking her lead from Rebecca West, Ms. Storace sees every event, object, or person in relation to herself. For example, it may be true, as she suggests, that every man in Greece lusted after her, but it's extremely improbable and of no interest to the reader. Less of this self-centeredness and more of landscape (which she handles so much better than people) would have made this a classic."
2,Poetic? Hardly. Judgmental and shrill.,"This is a tedious, pretentious book. It purports to describe a year in Greece (really, a year? it seems like ten) but succeeds only in revealing the shortcomings -literary and otherwise- of its protagonist. It fails as a narrative (too disjointed, too self-absorbed), and this despite a few good turns of phrase and a handful of intriguing insights. The main culprit is Ms. Storace's grating personality, which leaves the reader uninvolved in her exploits- this is one of the coldest, most cynical travel books I have ever read. Greece deserves better."
1,"Believe half of what you see, and none of what Storace wrote","What an intriguing name, and what a huge disappointment this book actually was! Having lived in Greece for over 10 years, I would not presume to know how ""the Greeks"" think or live - and she has the audacity to think she understands this country and its people after ""living"" less than a year in Athens? Her trite comments based on surface meetings, conclusions drawn from heresay, negative views of ""little"" non-Americans, and incorrect specifics on the history of Greece make this the most absurd book I have ever read. Shame on Patricia Storace, Shame! I would be very interested to know who funded her stay and this book!!"
1,A TERRIBLE BOOK,"Storace's book is a vivid illustration of how even a richly educated individual can be vastly ignorant. She completely misses the mark on the true benevolence behind much of Greek hospitality, and her pitiable retellings of the overtures of Greek men reveal nothing but her own egotism. Despite a solid understanding of Greek language and history, Storace has extremely limited understanding of Greeks themselves, in large part because her own ethnocentrism -- which reveals itself repeatedly in the book -- prevents her from regarding Greeks as equal to Americans. To read her ridiculous ""observations"" regarding Greeks (All Greeks look alike, Greeks don't smile) is to know the real meaning of The Ugly American.Her year in Athens was clearly too brief a period for her to understand Greeks.If you want to know Greeks, spend time with Greeks. Or visit Greece. Do not read this book."
2,Not as crazy about this books as others,"I was rather disappointed and underwhelmed by this book. Patricia Storadge writes more about her daily interaction with Greeks than about Greek life or culture, but her tone is often snide and condescending. There may be truths in her observations and even valid criticisms, yet I was disturbed by her attitude. The best part of the book was her description of the Benakis family history. A much more affectionate and refreshing look at Greek culture and life is a book published in Greece called ""The Unwritten Places,"" by Tim Salmon, an Englishman who lived and traveled with the Vlachs shepherds in the Pindos Mountains. Also Corelli's Mandolin, which, though a novel, really captures Greek culture with humor, love and enchantment"
3,Exquisitly insightful vignettes of modern Greece.,"Patricia Storace writes accurately and beautifully about life in modern Greece. Arranged in chronological order, the author amuses and engages us with her itinerary, insights, and, at times, wonderful historical research. A section on the Benaki family is especially satisfying and very little known I think. At the start of the book, I was awed by the depth of her understanding; by the end I found myself disappointed that the promise of those first hundred pages seemed to fall flat, weighed down as the author goes on and on recording what begin to feel like irrelevant details of her travels in long meandering sentences."
2,Nice if you don't have an oval tub,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old because she hates when I turn the water off in the tub when it's full. We have an oval tub and when she pushes the button, the toy falls over (it needs a flat surface). Also, it is very hard for her to push the button to make it shower. She had to press with both hands while I held the shower head up. I wished I knew that before I bought it. So, after one use, it's in the closet. A plastic toy watering pail from the dollar store worked just as good."
2,Wish it would have been done right...,"I know I shouldn't argue over an inexpensive title like this, but considering that this offers only 5 of the band's videos (Wildest Dreams, Other Side of Life, Running of Love, I Know You're Out There, and No More Lies), it dashes this fan's hopes that we will ever see a true, proper Video Collection by one of the greatest bands of all time. Most hardcore fans know that there are rare music videos for the songs Blue World and Sitting at the Wheel, and an even rarer, mostly unseen 1991 video for Say It With Love which is really sweet and SHOULD be included on this disc. All 5 of these videos are readily available on either the LEGEND OF A BAND DVD or the official Fan Club VHS that's been out for years. Someone missed the boat. What we really need is a full set of all the available videos, even at full price, which I have a good feeling Moody Blues fans would be willing to pay. This is a wasted effort..."
3,20th Century Masters - Too Small,"These 20th Century Master Colllections of a few videos aren't bad; they are just too short for the money. This one has five videos from 1986 and 1987 that are very good, but why only five? Personally, I will wait until a DVD video collection of more is released before I buy this. Another dissapointment is that there is no audio enhancement such as DTS or Dolby Digital."
2,not so great,This is not at all what I expected. Someone else may love it but I would rather not have a dvd that is a lot of videos. It seemed very chopped up and disconnected.
4,The Moody Blues video collection,"A very enjoyable, if too short, compilation of Moody Blues music videos.The first two, 'Your Wildest Dreams' and 'I Know You're Out There Somewhere', which offer a juxtaposition of the band's early days (young actors are playing their parts) and their present reality (1986/88), were the only ones scripted by the Moodies themselves, and 'Your Wildest Dreams' was nominated 'Video of the year' by Billboard magazine in 1986.'The Other Side Of Life' presents a disturbing view of a surreal, nightmarish underworld, and effectively supports a brilliant song.'No More Lies' combines clever animation with shots of the band members.'Running Out Of Love' is an upbeat, exciting and very sexy clip from an actual concert.I hope more Moody Blues videos make it to the DVD format in the future."
5,Excellent resource for principals!,"I am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the Milwaukee Public Schools system. We will use Wheatley's book as the primary resource for our professional growth at our MPS Middle School Principals Collaborative institute August 9-11, 1999. We are not just concerned with reform; we seek renewal as well. Wheatley provides the basis. She notes that Einstein said that a problem cannot be solved from the same consciousness that created it. The entire book is a marvelous exploration of this philosophy!"
2,Interesting premise. . .,"This is a useful read, but at times I found the linkages between physical and social sciences required me to suspend disbelief."
5,Leadership and the New Science,Compares how modern scientific theories like chaos and quantum physics relate to how business can be run instead the Newtonian model used now which breaks down everything into parts with a hierarchical paradigm.
5,Not a how-to book!,"It has been said that when a school of thought goes unchallenged, when we simply accept it as ""the way things are"", then we no longer hold the thought, it holds us.That is the value of this book: To present the science that has dominated Western thinking for three centuries and its effects on our world-view. The book then presents new discoveries in science that have replaced old thinking, then challenges us to revisit our world-view in light of the New Science. It is not prescriptive, nor should it be. It is about escaping the trappings of something you probably never challenge, then exploring the possibilities going forward."
2,"if you can, avoid reading this book. Just waste your time","KU MBA program is required to read this book for one of their course. It is really very disappointed after I read this book. No good logic in the book, no strong example to support the author's idea. Really waste of time."
5,Outstanding,"A friend lent me this book some years ago and I immediately bought a copy. It is not a cheap book, but if I had a dollar for every time a visitor got lost in it, it would have been paid for many times over."
4,Straightforward explanation. Simple examples.,"This book is good for those who just start developing COM objects for ASP. I think the way the writer starts from a simple example and escalates to a more complex issue is commendable. The scripts detailed in this book are functional and ready-to-use in nature. Kudos to Buczek for that. It sure did save me a lot of time.I don't use the CD at all. But looking at the the scripts gave me an idea where to start. Though I won't recommend this book for advanced COM developers, this book sure is worth the money for beginners."
4,Tested most of the components,"If you're putting web solutions into production and need quick, working code with minimal discussion, this is a great book. Many immediately useful routines and objects that can be incorporated into any IIS production environment. Perfect for people who have some understanding of SQL Server, ASP, VB, and object-oriented programming. If you don't, you may have trouble finding the right tweaks for your system, because explanations are minimal (some of us appreciate that)."
4,Pursenalities,"This is a very good book. I have made four of the purses and they are beautiful. I will make two or three others. Although I know how to knit, I am new to felting. The ""knitting basics"" section is quite good and easy to understand. The abbreviations list is also very helpful. However, some of the pattern instructions could be a little clearer. For example: The flap instructions for the Spring Fling Bag found on page 19 begin with ""with RS facing . . ."" I know RS means right side but should you pick the stitches up with the front of the bag facing you, or the back? This affects the ""ridge"" on the top of the flap. I still don't know the answer to this and have made two of these bags. Would also appreciate listing some substitute yarns --- especially the fantasy/decorative yarns.Pursenalities: 20 Great Knitted And Felted Bags"
2,Was expecting more.,"I wish the yarns used were more accessible to those not fortunate enough to have a yarn shop in the area and have to depend on the chain stores like Michael's that have a very limited selection or mail order which can be pricy. I know substitutions can be made but the yarns have to be researched and I guess the projects haven't inspired the effort, bar one or two. But the instructions are well writted and the pics are clear. I guess it's just a matter of taste."
2,I was disappointed.,"I read the reviews before I bought this book and I was really excited waiting for it to arrive. After I received it I wasn't real impressed. It's OK, but not as good as I thought it would be. I looked through it several times thinking I must have missed something, but it was still just barely OK. I might try some of the patterns at some point, but I can find better patterns on the internet and they are free. It didn't make much of an impression and it seemed like a lot of the same purses over and over again, maybe just in different colors. A disappointment."
1,Can't find novelty yarns include in this book,"The problem with Eva's novelty yarns:Gray Flannel purse, for an example, calls for 1 ball of One Line Nobile how much is one ball?Moreover, I have gone to two yarn stores and both the owners have never heard of One Line Nobile; I tried finding it on-line no luck. If Eva wants to use novelty yarns in her purses she should have yarns that can be easily found or explain what can be substituted. In addition how much yarn is needed one ball is not enough information.Most of her purses are using size 15 needles but the circular needles length can be 16"" to 29"". These purses can be very expensive to make.Moreover, I found the purses instruction difficult to follow.A lot of the purses are weird looking or just out of date. I found only two purses I want to make.Save your money and don't buy this book."
2,"Interesting build-up leads nowhere, real fast.","This book apparently won the Akutagawa Award, Japan's highest literary honour. How the judges deemed fit to place her in the company of such writers as Tanizaki Junichiro and Kawabata Yasunari is beyond me. The stories start off interestingly enough but the style of writing soon dulls the impact. Whether this is the fault of the writer or the translater I'm not sure but it is certainly distracting. The reader will find themselves being trailed behind some wonderfully imaginative stories, only to be abruptly dumped with a half page ending. I was left with the impression the the author had built up these grandiose fairy tales and was at a loss as to how she was going the come up with an ending. Very unsatisfying."
2,No space to practice,"This book was quite disappointing. While I like that it gives the little cues for how to make the letters, there is only a short space to practice and then on to something else. The practice lines are much too narrow for my 1st grade son as well, so am having to do it all on different paper, no need for this book! I like the Scott Foresman/Pearson D'Nealian workbook much better for first grade."
2,Microsoft Fluff,I would have to say that the author is strongly biased in favor of microsoft products. I think his overemphasis on using templates to create forms that can only be used by MS Internet Explorer was a major disappointment...
2,Intranet & Web Databases for Dummies (For Dummies),This book is good if you are using MS Access if not you are out of luck. Something on the cover or somewhere in the above description should have stated that this book is ACCESS focused. If I would have know this I would have purchased a different book.
1,"And if you don't understand this, you're a Zen-weenie","I've read quite a bit of Zen literature, including translations of the original sutras, koans, etc. but I'm most disappointed in this tape. The tape, and I assume the book, has the quality of a harangue, with the reader constantly admonishing the listener. Much of the tape has the form, . . .""and if you don't understand this, you will never understand anything about Zen."" After a while, it grows tiring. Buddha didn't phrase his lectures as cryptic, snide criticisms of his audiences capacity for enlightenment, and that's how this tape comes across. In contrast, listen to ""The Teachings of Zen: Master Dogen"" for a deep and empathic description of Zen philosophy."
2,It's cool,I so like his other cds better then this one i would get the other ones before you get this one.
3,Ok BuT mArShAlL mAtHeRs Lp Is BeTtER!,"I found Game Over because on Marshall Mathers LP in Stan they talk about how stan likes the underground stuff Eminem did with ""SCAM"" and I got curious and was looking for all the underground songs eventually I found this and I ordered it and it was ok but it would have been better if we had been more informed about it though. The Lyrics are tight though!"
3,Lettin' Go,"I think that this cd will not have to much success because of eminem's drop I don't think he made all his effort although it is still a good cd. I recomend you buy this cd if you really like eminem's lyrics because the beat isn't better than the other eminem cd's, I also think that the other artist's in the new cd sang better that eminem."
4,BLAZIN'!,THIS CD IS HOT TO DEATH. NUMEROUS UNDERGROUND ARTISTS ARE FEATURED ON THIS COMPILATION. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS WHEN COCOA BROVAS RIPPED THE MIKE TYSON'S PUNCH OUT BEAT BOTH REGGAE AND RHYME STYLE. THE MASTA ACE SONG IS SURE TO BE A BANGER. HOTTEST UNDERGROUND CD IN THE LONGEST! AND THAT'S NO LIE.!
1,dont bother!,"i would not recommend anyone to get anything from this white idiot, the thing that annoys me most about him is that he is a perfectly normal kid who whants to be BLACK, by acting crazy, i say daks like theese shouldn't even be allowed in any record companys. By the way im 14 not 12."
3,GAME OVER by Eminem,THIS IS NOT AN EMINEM CD. I heard his voice only once. But this is a good cd in general and is worth buying. My favorite song is hellbound. It has other cool songs too. Unfortunately lots of tracks are skits so its a pain to skip though them all the time. I think this cd is woth buying.
3,"FOR ALL YOU STUPID PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT EMINEM!!!","Ok... this is not Eminem... it has no affliation with Eminem; he is only 50 seconds of one song. This is Yosumi Reocords. This CD is awesome. I just bought Game Over and Game Over II. This is definitely the better of the two. But Game Over II is awesome too. The mix of video game and rap is the best. The best songs are from games that you can't recognize. Everyone says that Spread It Out and Super Brooklyn are the best songs, but that is only because they don't know what the other songs are from. Do not pay attention to any other reviews; this game is hyper."
4,m&m's lyrical candy !,"In the featured work of eminem he brings all the genius and explicite work that we have all come to love. The great thing about Game Over is the way he stays connected to his strong opinion which has become a rare trait in today's young rising stars. He brings it strong with this work and I strongly suggest the purchase to go along with the other two eminem releases that have struck gold. Although a powerful album, I see it only as 4 stars because the fact that the other two releases (marshall mathers lp and the slim shady lp) have such a strong impact on the industry, you can't compare."
5,I love Eminem,"This CD is great.. of course, like all his other cds. I'd recommend buying it if you're an Eminem fan and u know what to expect. Ok :)"
4,Good for introducing young children to mythology,"I do have to agree that the myths and stories told in this book have been sterilized, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for young children. I purchased this book for my young son. The illustrations are very nice and the stories, though condensed quite a bit, stay pretty true to the history."
4,Yeah Baby!,"Zip up your go-go boots and glue on them false eyelashes! Once you put this on, you will be instantly transported to those go-go days in the ever so wild and wacky mid sixties.Some of the hilites are:""House of Bamboo' - Andy Williams-mambo classic with a tropics twist.""The Beat Goes On""-Buddy Rich-wow can't say enough about this Sonny and Cher classic redux with a jazzy vegas swing!""Blow-Up a Go-Go""-have no idea who it's buy, but you will want to plaster yourself with body pain, jump in a go-go cage and say ""sock it to me"".""I'm a Man""-Spencer Davis Group, have no clue why exactly this is here but , yeah it works.There are many other swingin' go-go tunes as well as some psychedelic sounds with a touch of funk on this CD.Should you ever have a party that seems a bit flat...slide this baby in and turn on that black light!!"
1,a grownup needs to do this. not durable,"Very flimsy. A grownup needs to do this, or your kid has to be over 5. Painting, gluing, fixing is a pain. It broke off only minutes after we put it on. Solar panel is terrible. It only works if you have bright sunlight shining on it."
5,Destined for Oprah's Book Club and in every Christian's Home,"At first sight of the cover, I was immediately drawn in by the obviously helpless and defenseless black boy and I was doubly reminded of Richard Wright's Black Boy and of the disturbing images of Psychology 101 case studies. As only a true page-turner can, I found myself spellbound as the book evokes self-analysis and social commentary. A true and sometimes haunting story which mirrors the surface and the underbelly of the 'good ole days' and the new millenium. Sipp's story compels the pastor as well at the flock to remember that we as christians have embarked on a life-long struggle to be Christ-like I found the book has left me spiritually uplifted and thirsting for another sip of Sipp!"
5,"How to Rebuild Your Nissan/Datsun OHC Engine: Covers L-Series Engines 4-Cylinder 1968-1978, 6-Cylinder 1970-1984","Tom Monroe has given us a great deal of information on the L-series engines in this volume. Arranged in a logical and user-friendly manner, the text covers the rebuilding of these engines completely. The manual is based on rebuilding the 4 cylinder L-series, but the author has managed to include all necessary information on the L-6 in a lucid and easy to use manner. This manual, along with the ""How to Modify"" manual by Frank Honsowetz, is an absolutely essential addition to the Datsun Z car library."
3,An Interesting & Boring Video!,"Yes, parts are interesting, but parts are kind of boring. The first video ""The Investigation Begins"" focuses on the tehnology, process and planning of the investigation. The investigation becomes the story, not the Titanic. HOWEVER, it does show their attempt to raise a piece of the Titanic (which can now be viewed in exhibitions). This part is really cool!The second video ""Anatomy of a Disaster"" starts with a bang. The first 30-60 minutes are great. But, it seems to drag on until its end - leaving the thought of ""Will we have to watch this again?"""
3,Moving,"I thought that this book was moving--at least Miriam's story was. However, the instigator of the story is Julianna and her story is not delved into. I got the impression that this book was written shortly after September 11th, because of the acknowledgements page. It seems to fit, anyway--but it is a nice universal message--what would you do if you could have a ""do over""?Miriam's story spans over 60 years, and the story is moved along by a box of items found in her estate sale. Have kleenex nearby, as some of the emotions are so raw, you cannot help but be touched by them. This is the story not only of her life, but also her journey with God.I would recommend this book, and I will have to find more books that she has written."
5,An all-time favorite!,Ribbon of Years is an all-time favorite of mine! Such compelling characters and a story that really delivers! Ms. Hatcher at her best!
4,Historical Fiction - A great brain vacation!,"I disagree with the last review. This was a very good book. I suppose it depends on your reading purpose. I read for mostly for pure enjoyment. I did enjoy this book. I finished it in a lovely Sunday afternoon & it was great vacation for my brain.If you are looking for War and Peace then stopping here would dissapoint you. However, if you are looking for a story that takes you back in time to the WWII era, and a story that makes you want to finish the book. Then this is a great afternoon journey to take."
4,It was okay,The plastic bar made it hard for me to put on because it would bend and my peircing was still fairly new. Also the bar is short which mad it even harder.
3,Great,"This was a great piano book. It has a lot of good songs by the Carpenters in there. My only regret is that the songs aren't in the correct key that the Carpenters actually played them in. If you are looking for a book like that, get Love Songs."
1,Put on some music while playing the original Twister,"I bought this for my 9yr old cousin and sat back and played MC while she and my aunt tried to play the game. The directions are very confusing and neither my cousin nor my aunt enjoyed trying to follow along. A man and a woman shout out directions and if the woman says something it's a direction for the right foot (or arm) and if the man says something it's for the left foot (or arm). Confusion abounds, the game is going back."
2,Too Silly for Me,"I posponed my CNA due to this book and instead went ahead with my Cisco CCNA test. I am now (after 2 months)trying to decide if I want to suffer through this book or just buy something else. I just can not read a technical book with all of these distractions. It might even be funny if you weren't trying to prepare for a test! This is the hardest book to read I have ever come across...no kidding! lm mcse,ccna,a+"
3,too basic... too slow... too many pages...,"I'm having difficulty reading this book. It appears that the target audience is grade schoolers or persons who are completely new to the field... If the book had been cut down to about 300-400 pages, it might be excellent... at 800+ pages, it's just eating up reading time that I can't spare..."
1,THIS BOOK IS THE WORST - FLUFF IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT,"I'm not an avocate of burning books, but this book is the best candidate I have ever seen. I read the reviews and even though many of them said that it was filled with fluff, I thought I'd go with the overall rating on this book plus some recommendations I received. Well, this book is the WORST COMPUTER CERTIFICATION BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN. IF YOU READ THIS REVIEW, AND STILL BUY THIS BOOK, DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED! I almost never write reviews like this, but after getting burned by buying this book, I couldn't in good conscience not write this review. This book is my most disappointing purchase of the year. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!"
3,"A good book on Netware 5, but alot of fluf","The writer gets the book off to a bad start presenting the reader with a case scenario called ACME corporation. I stopped reading this book for almost a month at this point. Do yourself a favor and skip the fluf about ACME corp, (this ACME corp thing is too long and too confusing). All else is great. One of the better books out there about Novell Netware 5.0. Covers material very well, but way too much ACME corp scenario. I give it 3 stars."
3,300 Pages too long,"Author tends to repeat himself and would do much better by sticking to the facts. A reasonable enough book though which should get you through the exam - along with ""Real World"" practice."
5,"An excellent introduction to NetWare 5, despite the fluff","The reviewers who trashed this book are overreacting to a few (relatively minor) flaws in an otherwise excellent text. It's true that some of the material is extraneous, especially the section describing the fictitious ""ACME"" organization (i.e., ""A Cure for Mother Earth"" -- did Clarke really need to be so cute?). However, the bottom line is that this book will teach a CNA wannabe everything that he/she needs to know about NetWare 5. If you don't like the fluff, you can ignore it (like I did) and still learn what you need to know."
1,Negative 500 Stars,This is the most inane certification guide ever written. This book led me to temporarily dismiss the goal of becoming a CNA. Each page is a nauseating immersion into the fuddled mind of the worlds most irritating and idiotic technical clown. The text is brimming with insipid non-technical oriented prose that leads one so slowly down the antic strewn road to certification that time eventually stands still. Reading this book is an excercise in torture. I have never been so angry with a book in all my life. You are better off not being certified than having to read this book to get there.
1,Poorly Written Book,"This book should not be the primary text used for a Systems Engineering course, yet it was. I read several reviews that stated this book had errors. Indeed the author must not have proof read his text. It is poorly written with so many spelling and grammar errors you have to wonder how accurate the information in the text is. Additionally I have noticed that the author has half-facts or contradictory statements. If you are forced to purchase this book for a class, sorry to hear about that. If you have an option to not buy this book, don't."
4,A Pretty Good Discman from Sony,"I recently bought this, and I think its pretty good but not worth $120. The skip-protection and controls/remote are great, however there are several problems. First, the included carrying looks great - but it makes it a big hassle to change CD's. Also, the headphones included cant use the bass features of the discman well, and hurt after wearing them for a while (usually the sound is great though). So if I were you, I would go all out with the 815 or 915 or spend less money on another discman."
5,Great portable cd player,"I just bought this portable cd player a couple weeks ago and i love it. It has not skipped once, even with shock protection off! I even ran with it. It has good bass, and the battery life is better than any other brand out there. 32 hours. It is very thin and light, and the remote control is extremely handy. THe street style headphones sound ok too. I recommend buying a set of NiMh (nickel metal hydride) You will never have to buy batteries for it again! All you do is plug it in to charge it when your batteries get low, which takes a long time with Nimh batteries. I still dont understand how turning G-protection on makes any difference in the level of skip protection but oh well. It never skips anyway. You should buy this player(or the more expensive model! ) lol"
1,Piece of [junk],i had this cd player for about three months before the whole thing broke. It had nothing wrong until the computer board malfunctioned...So i can tell you do not buy this the money is rediculuos for [what] you get.
2,"Good player, but way too costly to replace batteries",This has been a decent player for me. But after about 6 months of playing my batteries no longer take a charge. I was told that 6 months is the approximate life span of these batteries. I needed to order replacements from Sony service. The result: $... for TWO batteries. That is 25% of the cost of a brand new one. Absolutely RIDICULOUS!
2,Too basic for adults,I could find nothing that provided more than a very basic insight into writing transitions.
2,Lack of examples,"Initially, I was impressed by the book's table of content (TOC). But, despite the exciting TOC, I found this book has not much to ""say."" For example, in the chapter of INDICATE CAUSE AND EFFECT, It provides one example of how to use the introductory adverb ""therefore"" in a sentence. Have you ever contructed a sentence like this: ""Therefore, . . ."" If you had, then this book is not right for you. I wouldn't consider it a book, it looked like a note. Beside, the content of it started at page 17 and ended at 53, so it contained only 37 pages, not 56 page as stated in the description section on Amazon.com."
3,Tiny - about one (short) chapter's worth of information,"You only get about 4"" x 3.5"" of text on every page. Only 33 pages have text, and those are filled with white space.There is enough content for a magazine article, or a *short* chapter in a textbook.It reminds me of the pocket-sized Dell books you used to find at the check-out in grocery stores for $1 with crosswords, puzzles and word-finders."
4,"Good reference book, a little dated","This book is good if you are just getting into the extreme metal scene and want a little info on some bands to see if you would like to buy some of their material. If you are looking for an in-depth write up on your favorite band though, look elsewhere. There are some omissions of some bands that should have been included, and some basic info on very influencial bands that should have been expounded upon. There is also alot of info on very popular bands that should not have been in here(Metallica). Also, since it was written in 2000 there are some good new bands that have not been mentioned. Now while that is not the authors fault, just be warned your favorite new band might not be in here."
4,GOOD WESTERN!!!!!,"Good Tim McCoy western. The Echo Bridge DVD has fine print quality, although it is short the original running time."
4,A Dandy of a Single,"Obviously the title track is great, and here it exists with a shorter intro. The ""We Used To be Friends"" mix isn't bad, but nothing tops the original. The standout track, is the reworked ""Everyday Is A Holiday,"" as this song was made for speeding tickets. What a driving guitar masterpiece with a chorus that begs to be sung along with. The single is worth it alone for song 3."
5,Don&#65533;t understand the Bad Reviews,"This book was/is great. Very well written, concise, maps well to the exam objectives... The exam watches and two minute drills are right on. However, experience is a key. I have to laugh at those who expect a study guide to do it all for them. I've spent a lot of time, money and practice in order to study for and pass these exams. They are difficult, and study guides are written for assistance, and this one gives it. By the way, in response to the reader below, I've used Syngress books to pass my CCNA exam, as well as the ACRC and CIT exams. Sure, there are some typos, but I've never seen a technical book that's perfect. Trust me, this book will provide valuable assistance. Thank you, and good luck."
1,Exam info missing.,Where's the beef? Only one or two questions from this book were on the CIT exam. Not a study guide for the exam. Helps you memorize troublshooting techniques.
3,This book's title should be changed.,"If you want to learn about network troubleshooting, this is a great book. However if you want to use this book as your preparation tool for CIT exam, forget it. You won't pass the exam even if the exam is open book. I suggest that the author should change the book's title."
3,Couldn't pass the exam with this book.,"I passed the ACRC using the Lammle Sybex book and the Laura Chappel ACRC book. This was the only CIT book out at the time, so I thought I'd use it for the CIT exam. I failed. Many typos in practice questions and the CD is useless. However, the authors seems to be pretty bright and know real world info you can use in a production enviornment. Look for a different book to pass the CIT exam. I think there are other Cisco books out related to the CIT exam. Check those out."
2,Don't use this as your only study material for the exam!,"I took my CIT 4.0 Exam after reading and taking notes extensively on this book, I also ran the practice test included on the CDROM a multiple times, I went into the exam confident I would blow it away after 10 questions, none of which had been adaquately covered in this book, I began to worry.I ended up passong (barely) but not because of anything I had gleaned from this book, if not for Todd Lammele's excellent CCNA prep guide and my hands on experience I would have failed miserably.I strayed from Lammele's book on this one b/c it was out of stock, I will never make that mistake again. This book is 800 pages of general info without any really good instruction, as for the practice tests, I've taken Cisco Sales Certification exams that are harder!"
2,"Should be one star, but...","Has some info you can use in the day-to-day grind. However, nothing on the exam is in this book! Jezz, call it something else, but not a Study Guide for the CIT exam. Better written then their CCNA book, but same conclusion: You can't pass an exam from this damn company!"
2,More a brain dump than a study guide!,"There is an awful lot of information in the book but it is extremely poorly organised, with very few examples or diagrams. I've spent a great deal of time trying to extract and reorganise the important information from the huge monolithic textual descriptions used in the book.Also a great deal of the information in the book was new to me, but I passed the CD test first time without reading the book. The CD questions and end of chapter questions go into about one quarter of the depth of the information presented in the book.However, the two-minute drills are a good idea."
1,"ZERO STARS given, but it is not one of the choices","What a waste of $50. This was my first Syngress book purchase, and simply I was horribly disappointed. The book does not help at all with the CIT test and is poorly written. If this book is indicative of the Syngress CCNP books, this will be my first and LAST PURCHASE in the series."
1,Book is useless,I have passed two of the CCNP tests. The first I did with a Syngress book and said I would never buy one again. There were parts on the test that were never covered in the book. The second test I used Cisco Press and the book was MUCH better. I would recommend using a Cisco Press book before another Syngress. I have read this book and found out what it was lacking when I went to take the test. Stay away from Syngress books!
1,Don't buy this book!,"I have taken three Cisco exams so far and two of them were with Syngress books and one was with a Cisco Press book. I thought I learned my lesson when the first book was bad but I didn't. I learned it again wit this book. The Syngress books do NOT cover all the sections on the exam, not the way the Cisco Press book did. This book also had me reviewing material that was not even remotely on the test. I will NEVER but a Syngress study tool again."
4,"Turning Japanese, I Think I'm Turning Japanese (I Really Think So!)","Bought two of these from a large local retailer (Fry's Electronics) in the Bay Area.Both had Japanese language firmware in them. Had to flash with v2.21 off the website to restore English setup interface.After that, they work great."
3,Lovejoy becomes involved with older women.,"This book seems to be even more frenetic than some of the previous. I found it a bit confusing, and some issues never did get resolved. We still get lots of good antique information, and we learned the ins and outs of auctions for fakes, but a lot of plot strands were dropped on the way. It seems like Gash is trying to make Lovejoy even scruffier and even more scattered, and the book loses by this. I still like this series though, and will continue to read until the end. If nothing else there are usually enough surprises at the end to keep me going with the next installment."
3,Here we go again--redux,"In reviewing Every Last Cent, I noted that any author who does sequel after sequel must guard against making his character a cliche. Rex Stout managed to churn out Nero Wolf novels year after year and still kept his major character entertaining. The reason was his plotting. His character never became more important than the plot. In The Grace in Older Women, Gash falls into the same trap he encountered in Every Last Cent, cliches wrapped around a weak plot.However, I'm a die-hard Gash fan. Anything he writes, I buy. So, it's cliche riddled. I like the cliches!"
2,Plot twists that go nowhere,After reading several of Gash's novels this was one I could definitely put down. It started strong but ran too convoluted until the last few chapters when everything came to a quick solution. Not one of his better works.
5,Great Illustrations!!!!!!!!!,I absolutely love this dictionary!!!! It has the best illustrations which makes it fun to flip thru. I highly recommend this reference book.
1,Be Warned! THis is NOT a Visual Dictionary!,"My star-rating is not a comment on the book as a dictionary; it's probably pretty competent in that respect. But this is NOT a visual dictionary. It is a mix between a visual and a normal dictionary- more like a normal dictionary with color pictures.i ordered this in time for my friend's b-day and he has always wanted a visual dictionary. But guess what? this is a plain old dictionary with occasional pictures! oh dear oh dear. while trying to decided between the choices on amazon, i clicked between this one, the Macmillan, the DK Visual Dictionary and in my own little way decided this one sounded best. I thought it would be a Visual dictionary because it was cross-listed with all the above ones- well, it is not. So be careful while buying please, and if any amazon folks read this, please be more clear in how you advertise the book."
5,Great Gift!,"I purchased this dictionary as a gift for someone who admired my son's copy. The recipient loved it! The illustrations are amazing and a nice addition to the basic ""definitions""."
3,Nice but not bright,"This bulb comes very close to the color of a 60w incandescent bulb and it is about the right size. So far, so good. The downside is that it is not as bright as a 60w incandescent. I am sure I will find some use for it around the house, but not in the bathroom. (Maybe if we had a two light fixture it would work.)"
4,I am either to dumb or not enlightened enough to understand most of this.,"Peaceful, relaxing reading of Master Dogen's writings by Gary Snyder. Maybe if I listen to it another 10-20 times I will start to make some sense of most of the inner meanings! What is it with rivers and mountains, anyway?"
4,"Very good book, but many typos","Using this book as my primary study source, I passed CCNA with 967/1000. It's a terrific book - well organized, has all the information that was on CCNA and more. I would have given this book a 5, but there were many minor errors in it (which you can easily catch once you know your stuff very well). I'd recommend this book to anyone with at least basic networking knowledge, who'd like to pass CCNA, or would just like to learn more about Cisco hardware & IOS syntax, TCP/IP & IPX, routing, LAN/WAN hardware, etc."
4,You need this book,This book is very in-depth. It is a good book to read to get familiar with the information that is on the test. Warning...do not take this test lightly. I was a CNE and MCSE before I took this test the first time. I felt that the MCSE tests were a walk in the park compared to this test. I used another book to prepare for the first test and failed with a 784. I bought this book read it in 2 days studied for 3 more and passed the test. Although I found a few mistakes in the book it was a very valuable reference. Just make sure you have at least one more reference.
1,Buyer Beware,"Anyone looking to purchase a cookbook with recipes associated with traditional Jewish Eastern European cuisine will be disappointed with this book. I found the book title grossly misleading. Others may not care, but in my opinion a book that is associated with Jewish Grandmothers should be kosher. I am not sure if I was more offended by the brisket sandwich made with rye bread, swiss cheese and mayonnaise or a sandwich called the Jewish Hero with turkey and cheese. There are some traditional recipes in this collection, just be aware that many of the recipes in this book are not kosher."
3,A book for dummies should not have bugs,"The book that claims: ""Confused by syntax issues on constants, arrays, or variables? Looking for fast solutions to writing reusable object-oriented code? "".....however on page 115 on Arrays, the proper definition should be ""int Myarray[7]...and not ""Myarray[6]..."" It took this dummy and the compiler and another text to figure this out. A book that claims to be a reference for dummies should be bug-in-syntax free. Also their web site should have an errata section. Should I depend on this quick reference ?"
1,What an atrocious CD!,"Whatever you do don't waste your money on this disc. It is soooo tiring and monotonous that after you listen to it you may want to break it into many small pieces. This is absolutely the worst CD that Global Underground has put out. Believe me, I have almost all of them. There's really nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. There might be three decent songs on the whole two discs, the rest are horribly, terribly repetitive. It's dark and boring in the beginning, dark and boring in the middle, and dark and boring at the end. There's almost nothing but tribal drum after tribal drum after tribal drum until you go insane and want cut your ears off with a plastic butter knife! You don't need the hospital bills, really. If you want your ""dance"" music to put you into a drool inducing stupor this is the disc for you. If not, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. Zero out of five stars!"
1,Not the one,"I was really looking forward to this cd like most global uderground cd's, and i am sorry to say that this was not worth the wait. CD one was ok. I mean I could listen to it and not know that it was on. CD2 well lets just say that it will become a frisbee. I look forward to hearing more from Steve in the future but this cd just was not the one."
5,Very Diggable,"As with most good albums, whether it be rock, house, trance whatever, it took me a few litens to this album to warm up to it but it has become one of my favotites in my collection. Very drum and percussion oriented, Lawler is a deep bassy breath of fresh sound. Nice track 'Voices', originally a Police song (Voices Inside My Head) is crisp but at the same time tribal with it's thick beat. In fact the whole album is bassy, groovy, and slick. I've purchased three of the NuBreed releases (Howells and Pappa the other two) and this is the best release so far, by a wide margin. Think about it, this is the album he needed to break onto the gobal underground scene with, he knew he needed to impress those two fat boys runnin' the underground. I think he more than impressed them. You'll dig it if you're into a sort of tribal sound with thick molassassy beats. Give it a go."
4,Wood Block Water Color Prints,"Stewart J. Teaze was my grandfather. He was a WWI pilot, and earned his wings on the JN-4 in Texas. He later resided in Japan, where he represented the interests of an American Oil Company... my father and aunt were born in Japan, and attended The American School In Japan.Interestingly, when WWII broke out, my grandfather was interned in Japan. He eventually was released thru The Philippines, which was neutral at the time. My understanding is that my grandfather received some better treatment, than he otherwise would have been given, due to his knowledge of Jacoulet prints, and the internment commander's interest in Jacoulet.I've got two of these beautiful prints hung in a shady corner of my room, out of the way of the sun's rays."
4,Good companion book,"This book focuses on the issue of Private Property, a concept that rarely recieves attention, even in pro-capitalist literature. That is the book's strength, a solid summary on the negatives of public ownership and the liberty that flows from private property. ""Where private property is nonexistent, selfishness has free reign.""If there is a negative, it is that the book jumps around a bit. There are other books that I think do as good of a job (if not better stylistically) of addressing the failures of socialism (Re: Heaven on Earth by Muravchik) and there are other books that provide a positive prescription for world poverty via private property (Mystery of Capital by DeSoto). This book straddles those two, overlaps them, and thus is a fine companion piece."
3,12 bucks is too much for 6 song cd,"This is a pretty good cd but it is not worth paying full price of a cd for only 6 songs. The band is alright and shows signs of improvement and I think they might make a name of themselves if they work more on putting more onto a cd. The song ""On the Waterfront"" is pretty swank and is almost worth buying this cd simply for this song. So don't go out in a rush to buy this cd, you know. If you've ever got an extra 20 bucks or so and you don't know what to do with it, this cd would be a good choice. And for any TRUE swinger out there this should be on your priority list to buy."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this game for half the original price and had I known how bad it was I wouldn't have even paid that amount. The graphics are absolutely terrible, I have seen some Nintendo games with better graphics. And just plain and simple this is the worst RPG that I have ever played."
1,I just don't like it...,"Ok, it's Christmas morning. Everything is going really cool. I just got a playstation 2, and this cool looking game to go with it. I pop in the game. I am met with something that looks like a horrible Diablo rip-off. Maybe I just don't like it because I hat Diablo, but I played this game for 2 minutes before turning it off. After that, I promptly went to my local Blockbuster to rent some MUCH better games like Dynasty Warriors 2, Orphen, and Armored Core 2. I know that these are just my personal feeling on the game, but I felt that I may as well share them. Also the graphics weren't particulary revolutionary or anything..."
2,"Good story, bad gameplay.","I got a PS2 the day it came out. There was a lot of games but I had to leave quickly so I just grabbed the most interesting looking box. I found ""Summoner"" and I thought, woah, this game is gonna be amazing! I popped it in, and let a rip. Before I knew it I was bored out of mind! This game is no way up to the PS2s standards and it gets kind of repetitive. I like the story and the sub-quests, but I just couldn't get into it. Bottom line, I should've got SSX."
1,I can not believe that this game was this bad.....,Summoner is NOT worth the money that you will spend on this game. It's graphics are not good as they could be with this new system. I have a few of the other new games and so far they both are better than summoner. Ever Grace is ALOT better. It has a better story line and it is alot more fun to play. Just thought that I would let everyone know before they waste their money.
3,lotsa hype but not lotsa fun,I was impressed with how smoothly the 3 dimensional areas flowed on to the screen and how many sub quests were available. Howeverthe game kind of fights for you normaly and you can set the chains on automatic so it will completely fight for you which takes all the fun out of the game.
4,This game is....strange,"I cant dont know how to describe this game. It definitley is not a pretty game, but then that maybe more style than lack of good art, giving the game a more serious type of feel. The story is very interesting and every person you meet has something to say. People sometimes think final fantasy or other rpgs are a bit too linear or scripted, well this game is the opposite of that. I spend a lot of time wandering around and trying to figure out what exactly im supposed to do. The figthing is interesting, if you do chain attacks you cant get damaged by the enemy. I wouldnt give this game 5 stars , but 3 seems to little for a game that i have played 3 times longer than Onimusha(i loved that game but it was so short) and still have what im guessing is half of it to go."
4,Great but flawed,"This game is great for those who like rpg`s, although I should warn you that it is very different from final fantasy.If you`ve ever played Vagrant Story, you`ll have a much better idea of how it plays.The battles occur in real-time,you`ll find none of that turn-based stuff here.This helps keep it very exciting, as you constantly fight against monsters.On the downside, if you are new to rpg`s, you`d better give this one a miss, as at times, it is incredibly hard.But if you are looking for something different than final fantasy, give this one a go."
4,Summoner,"Summoner is a truely great game. It has a massive stoyline and the environments are awesome. There are a couple problems, however. For one, the story does take a while to really get going. You must be forgiving. There is a graphics problem that you will surely notice as well. Standing from afar you may not see, say a building, but as you walk closer it will appear. It also takes a while to get around, and learn your surrondings. Summoner is a very solid game, and if you have the patience and can forgive some rushed mistakes, this game is a great choice."
2,Kinda slow & .....,"I just can't beleive the game doesn't let the characters talk, it's all reading and very (1 at a time) slow fighting scenes. Is this game always in the tutorial mode? Because I can't seem to get out of it...... The game seems like it has possibilities, but it just doesn't do it for me. Am I doing something wrong in the setup? I don't think so..... and If I am, LMK because this game might as well be the Parasite Eve of PS2.... I was disappointed when the characters weren't capable of talking. That takes away the emotion....."
1,Very Disappointing,"This was one of the first games that I had purchased for the PS2. I really love role playing games, and this just didn't meet my expectations. The graphics are more like PS, or even compariable to Super Nintendo. Wouldn't even consider to buy this if I had known what it was like before hand."
1,the fighting was good!!....No WAy,All I have to say was that it was the worst game i ever played.It blowed!!When you fight you have to wait like 5 seconds before he even hits the guy.The graphics are terrible.The man character looks dead!If I was you I wouldn't buy this horrible and annoying game
1,"Summoner has poor graphics, poor audio, poor playability.","Summoner is bad. Just bad. There is no way around this. The graphics are fuzzy and unimpressive. Compared with Ultima IX on a PC with V2 1000 (ancient 3D graphics card!), the poeple are just plain badly rendered. And the plot and dialogue are limited to scrolling text! I demand audio dialogue in games of this generation. Finally, the play is simplistic. The ""chaining"" combat system works fine, but is uninteresting after a few moments. This is the truth : Crusaders of Might and Magic, a PS1 title I bought used ..., is superior in every way."
1,This game ...,"Thank God I rented this game first. When I put the game in and saw the graphics, I figured I must have rented from the Playstation1 rack, but that was not the case. The graphics just ... that bad.Also, the way that you fight on this game is ridiculous. Point at the attacker and push X, wait, push X, wait. You really have no control over it.For those of you thinking about buying this game, don't.People that give this game a good review are trying to trick you into buying this game. ..."
2,For Final Fantasy Fans Only,"I am a fan of RPG's and similar games for all systems, including the Resident Evil series and the Legend of Zelda series. I've also played the Final Fantasy games, and one thing is clear. You must enjoy the Final Fantasy format to appreciate Summoner. If you don't, you'll probably want to stay away and wait for Code Veronica and other games that will be out in the future. The combat mode (called chain attack) is nothing more than timing. You have no real control over combat situations beyond selecting a spell or move and then watching the game execute it if you time it right. Then, when your turn is up, you stand idly by and take whatever damage your current enemy dishes out. (Much like Final Fantasy) In addition, the information that the characters must get from villagers, etc. comes in annoying, long and largely useless scroll formatting. If Final Fantasy bored you after just a bit (as it did me), skip Summoner."
4,Great RPG story,I loved this game. Initially the graphics disappointed me but the game is heavy on mood and story and that is what makes a good RPG. RPGs are meant to have a certain length to them and this one delivers in spades. By the end you really feel as if you have taken an epic journey. It makes me wonder how much better games will be down the road when the technology catches up with the storylines and produces games that are as visually attractive as they are imaginative. This one is very imaginative but the graphics are primitive by todays gaming standards. That has generally been a problem with all RPGs. They take so much longer to produce than an FPS or adventure game that the graphics are never as good.If you don't mind the graphics and like a true RPG this is your game!
4,This game keeps you interested,"After reading through some of the reviews of this game it looks like some people disliked the fact that it has a large number of mini-quest that you can complete. Personaly I think that this is what make Summoner a good game. I think that the longer it takes to complete a game the better. This game allows you to take your time and try to complete every mini-quest or to just concentrate on the main quest, which will still take you a while to complete. I usually get bored with role playing games after a few hours of play because they don't keep you involved in the game. In my opinion summoners many quest and overall style of game play help keep the game exciting even after hours of playing. The game does have a few bugs but nothing to big in my opinion. Overall I think this is a great game for those looking for a little more action than the average RPG."
2,Not too good,"The graphics on this game were very disapointing and the gameplay is not too great either. Only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because there is a storyline, something many games are lacking now-a-days. I would not have bought this game if I had taken a closer look at the graphics."
4,Story or Gameplay?,"Summoner is a game that you will either love or hate within the first 6 hours or so. It really depends on what you look for in an RPG. If you need a good battle system and flashy graphics, you won't find that here, but you can expect to find some of the best and biggest level design around. The places you explore are beautiful and interesting but not graphically stunning. You will fight some well designed monsters and bosses, but don't expect to be stunned by their flashy looks. In fact, the entire game looks drab and dark. The music is some ambient filler, with the exception of one or two asian themed songs. What really pushes the game forward is the story. Once again, it depends on what you are into. There are four races and two of them are involved in this game. You will hear complicated histories similar to Roman mythology. If you can't read a novel, you can't play this game. I enjoy novels and mythology, and I enjoyed this game."
4,"Good Game, some flaws, but nothing terrible","Ok I have been playing RPGs ever since the good old days of comadore 64. and since then I have seen some horrible games, most of them were ON the comadore 64. But sommoner is a pretty good game. The graphix are good, and the sound is good too, but the story gets a little boring after playing for a bout 3 hours, Then it picks back up then goes down again it's like that throught the whole game! But the Oly BIG problem I got is that you are fighting for Hours and Hours at a time and that gets a little old. I mean people complain about random battels how there are too many. well this game has more battles then most other RPGs out there. so over all this game is worth the money. but I wouldnt suggest it for some one who is a DIE HARD RPGer like myself."
4,"Okay, sort of pointless","It's a pretty good game with great archetecture. Other visuals are sort of blocky. The game play is addicting, but can be repetitive.The best part is in the credits, if you press the x button, it goes into a hilarious scene where the characters are playing an RPG, including a monster outside the door asking for cheetos and a mountain dew. I would recommend it to haardcore RPG gamers, but to others it may be bore."
2,Nice Try,"I purchased this game with the expectations of something new. I was terribly surprised when I loaded SUMMONER and although it had some impressive graphics much of the gameplay was as simple as POKEMON Silver Version that I purchased for my 7 year olds' Game Boy.The problems start with the horizons and move right into your first RPG conversation which is all in text. You would think that for a game of this generation that many of the characters would at least talk to you, even if your response was text scripted. The fight scenes are distant and not that exciting once you've mastered the chain moves.I did like the story board and once in town the game was playable but, only until you have gotten your 50th or 60th quest (far too many). I gave this game two stars because I am not a true RPG fan but was hoping this one would win me over...It didn't."
2,Summoner,I think the game is a entertaining idea. I am very disappointed in the fact that I think the game has a bug and can not be switched to solo play. This is very important because you can not complete the quest.
4,This game isn&#65533;t a quarter as bad as everyone says,"The summoner is a good game with horrible graphics and a cool battle system.Graphics:5/10. The graphics are pretty ... [bad] but people forget that this IS a RPG. The graphics aren't exactly going to be devil may cry.Sound:5/10. There's extremely little voice acting and everything else is just average.Control:8/10. Nice, easy controls.Story:6/10: An average story. Nothing special nothing bad.Cinames:4/10: Suuuurrrreeeee.....replay:5/10. I suppose.Characters:4/10. The main character (joseph) Looks like he just got kicked out of the holocaustOverall fun:8/10. despite all the horrible things I said about it, the summoner has a new, original battleing system and a simple leveling up system."
2,Look's like they rushed this one,"I'll make this short and sweet. Combat is not much fun,random encounters are verry repititious.there is an annoying little pop when a healing spell is used (sound Glitch),takes too long to load which is done about every 5 mins. But the A.I. works well, the towns are verry big and have many areas to explore if you are a seasond RPGer Make sure to rent this one before you buy itso you are not let down or wait for another RPG prefferably not one that was rushed."
4,"Good Graphics, Storyline, etc. Above Average RPG","An above average rpg, nothing of Final Fantasy or Lufia fame, but definitely worth the hard earned money. Graphics are good, camera angles occasionally are annoying, but then again what game doesn't have that problem. Storyline is occasionally hard to follow, but very interesting and it sucks you in. This game is hard to pull away from. Buy it if you are an RPG fan, not if you are an occasional, fairweather fan."
2,Summoner,Not very good. Sort of vacant in places. Graphics are blocky. Dont judge a game by its cover. :)
1,I would rather play pac-man,"I gave this game my very best attention span I could muster, and I am pretty easily entertained. I thought the story line was very good and there were some original ideas. However the play was so slow -- this game is not for impatient people who like to move quickly around. The graphics were like PS1. I would caution you to rent this before you buy it."
2,you like this game u half to play onimusha,I think that the graphics on this game are poor but it has a good plot. and you cant even control when you hit and when u block! so I thought that this game was ok and then i played onimusha and i have nothing but good things to write about that so if u like this game u half to play onimusha!
4,summoner,"it was a good game overall i was a little disapointed in the play.. to many cut fight sceens during your walk from city to city...the characters were good but i felt the graphics could of been a little more in depth,especially for the p.s.2 system...it will be interesting to see the second game in the series..hopefully they can make the play more detailed and clear up some of the graphics.."
2,"Enjoyable game in the beginning, load times kill it.","This was one of the first games I had for PS2. In the beginning it was fun and I really didn't mind the now tedious load times. But after running back and forth from city to city and going between zones in the castle, I couldn't bear to play the game any more. The game needs to load: 1) when entering battle (from the world map), 2) when leaving a city and going to the world map, 3) when entering a city from the world map, and 4) sometimes in the cities and dungeons between zones. As I said, in the beginning it doesn't really bother you, but when you're looking for a certain person and can't remember which city they're in or which zone of the castle they're in, it gets frustrating watching the game load constantly."
2,Problems with CD,I have this system for about 2 years. Initially it was great. Now left speaker does not work with CD's. It's still OK for radio and cassette. I sent e.mail to Sony and they offered refurbished system for 93$ (brand new costs max.99$) or repair for 110$.It looks like a usual problem with this system (see other reviews). Next time I'll buy Sharp or Panasonic or Philips.
2,Is this a Sony player ?,"KK (Dallas, TX)The left speaker doesn't work when I play cd's, but it works just fine when the radio or a tape is playing.....doesn't make sense ! Makes me so mad !!!"
3,Boombox,The Sony Portable CD/Cassette/Radio Boombox is just the right size for my classroom. The only component that is not to my liking is the knob on the left that searches for the correct song. You must wait for the cd to be read and then carefully watch for the number as you dial it up or down. It works better if using the remote that is included.
4,COULD USE MORE VOLUME ... BUT,"I still rate it 4 stars because of the quality of the sound, the reliability of the cassette decks and the low price. Sony has been making this same product for several years with no changes, so that means it's great, right?"
3,What ever happened to sony,"remember in the old days, when sony made high quality products for a good price. Well they don't anymore. This is good quality, rather bulky, but the price is to high, when similar products cost $10 to $20 less! i reccomend a different brand"
4,Decent boombox,"I liked this after seeing so many tacky looking stereos when shopping. This looked somewhat simple. I have had it for over 2 years and use it almost nightly (the radio or CD player) to put my son to sleep. My only complaint is tht the radio has to be tuned on the CD seek/scan buttons. You can't hold them down to go quickly, so changing stations can be time consuming and annoying. They should be on the dials (one controls volume, the other to your radio presets). Overall, I'd recommend this stereo for something inexpensive, reliable and reasonable looking."
3,Allright,I have bought Sony radios in the past and they were great on sound. This unit; big as it is; is not that good sounding! It sounds tinny because of the thin plastic speaker enclosers. I should have bought the xplod. I am happy with everything but the sound.
5,great item at an affordable price,Everything works great with this boombox nothing wrong and the sound with bass works great. Plays great quality with cd's and I love using the remote I could just push the power button and my favorite radio station is automatic.
3,Sent It Back,"The boombox arrived in a timely manner. The packing was somewhat shoddy. It was far to big to put into the area of my home I had designated for it. It would not fit in any area of my home.The company, Etronics, had an easy return policy and I received my CC account credit in a reasonable time.I would do business with this company again."
4,Still happy,I have had this unit for quite a while I think I got it when it was on sale. I still use it in the bedroom listening to cd's putting me to sleep at night.Great deal. The controller is another story if you make a controller with all the same size buttons with no distiguishable pattern make it illuminate so you can see it at night. I have memorized many controllers by use but this one I still have to turn on a light to find the right button.
2,The Dummy Series,These books (the __________ for Dummies) are very thin on real material that can really help. They tend to cover items and information that you can glean from using the product by yourself after just a short period of time.
3,where's the internet stuff?,A good book for new users but not much about the Net. Isnt't the i in iMac stand for the Internet?
4,Excellent for experienced Mac users and neophytes.,"As a writer/designer, I've work on Macs every day for years, but just bought an iMac. This book is as helpful to me as it is to a friend with little computer experience. If you buy the iMac, buy this book."
4,"perfect for beginners, though I'm not","This book is perfect for those people who know absolutely nothing about computers, or macs anyway. If the first computer somebody buys is an iMac, (which, by the way, would be wise) this is the book to get. It's got everything from how to turn the machine on, to turning it off, and EVERYTHING that you will do in between. And it's laid out so simply. If you've owned a mac before, and just bought an iMac, don't buy this book. It truly is a book for ""dummies"", or beginners."
3,The iMac for dummies,"The book is very funny and does get you started. If you want to use it for a quick reference after you have read it, the jokes get in the way. Doesn't cover OS9 hardly at all. That was my main problem. I have OS9 and this book is probably great for OS8 and older. Would not recommend for OS9."
5,A work and a half!!!!,"I bought this book for my 71 year old Mother for whom we just bought an iMac. It was my first encounter with David Pogue. I sort of ho-hummed as I picked the book up with a highlighter in one hand. I didn't put it down until I finished it. It not only helped me with my own G-3, but you should se my Mom!It is funny and easy to follow & I promise you will search out all of Mr. Pogue's other works. Enjoy!! Siralewker@aol.com"
2,Such a disappointment,"I bought this toy for my newborn son. It looked so cute and substantial online. Well, the dragon itself is only two inches tall, and is somewhat chincy - made with polyester. The egg is really most of the toy, and the dragon sits inside of it. I was quite disappointed, and don't even know if I will bother giving it to my babe. I would send it back, but after shipping, it isn't worth my time."
1,Not for the serious craps player,"This book reads more like a letter to Penthouse magazine, and a poorly written one at that. It's full of Tina's ""life story"", of marginal interest when one is trying to gain insights into the game of craps.Some of the craps information she presents, such as counting until the eleven has not appeared for 20 rolls then placing increasing bets until it wins, are not very practical, and don't even work very well.There are dozens of other books on craps that are better, and have a lot more useful content than these 80 or so pages."
1,This book rips off James David Barber,"This is a terrible book. Hargrove rips off famous Duke scholar James David Barber and tries to use ideas Barber had introduced years previously as his own.Fortunately, not many people has purchased this book. You can save some money but not doing the same"
5,The Essiantial Physics of Medical Imaging Review,"This is a very nice book for and introductory survey to medical imaging. I highly recommend this book for biomedical engineers interested in imaging, medical students, or any other applicable field."
4,Great balance between physics and medicine.,"As a future radiology resident, I bought this edition (older now) to skim through and see how I liked it. Three chapters in, I think this book has a great balance between the physics of medical imaging, while stating its message to a future clinician. It has enough depth to explain chemical and physical properties of imaging for any of those interested. It might be too in depth for radiology training (e.g. I highly doubt a majority of my future work will involve the content of this book), however for a future clinician wanting an in-depth description of how medical imaging is done, this book is perfect."
5,exellent,couldn't expect a better book in terms of condition and price. Every page is so neat and the hard cover is truly a genuine one.thanks amazon
5,"Excellent, but watch focus on table models, few floor models","An excellent reference with great bibliography -but one warning - it focuses strongly on ""table"" model phonographs - has few pictures of upright floor cabinets. However it led me to buy a number of additional references to identify British machines."
5,All the essential elements of the Myth,"Not only is this book a wonderful read, for students of comparitive mythology it is an invaluable extraction of the key elements of one of the greatest epics of all time.What Buck does is filter out the religious sections, an insurmountable barrier to any but the most dedicated students of theology, and focus in on the narrative.The reslut is the bridge that brings this critically important Eastern perspective on the Epic to western lovers of such works as the Iliad.Do not miss adding this to your library."
5,A Classic Well Done,Buck does a remarkable job with this classic of Indian literature. It's the best version I've seen.
1,Factually incorrect.,"I wanted to read a copy of the Ramayana for a long time now, even though I was already told and was familiar with many of the stories from my parents. I am a Hindu, and was looking forward to read this.However, I had to stop on page 16 or so. It provided descriptions of Rama being born with forty teeth, green skin, hair and eyes. It also told Bharata of being born with red skin, hair and eyes. Nowhere in the world except for this book will you find descriptions like these. If you want the true essence and factually certainty of the Ramayana, pick up another translation."
2,Amateurish,I am sure the story of Rama is a beautiful one that is full of rich historical context. Unfortunately this book does not really capture it. One can really sense the author struggling with the translation as some passages sound like they were written by a child. I did find some parts of the book very quotable and for that reason I gave it two stars.
4,Great stuff...,Take a saxaphone.....add a Scott Hamilton....stir it all up and you have a wonderful desert of music!
4,"Dark and suspenseful, but interesting and exciting","This book was not amazingly well-written, nor was it by any means light and happy, as I like a book to be, more or less. However, it brought out some very good ideas and theories about extraterestrial Earth domination. It actually was a satisfying book, to me, because of its prequel status, and the fact that it just told more about the series, which I have read. I would have probably rated it three-stars if it was a book by itself, due to a sad ending."
4,"perhaps a little out-of-date, but still well-woven sci-fi for middle-grade boys","I read the book _City of Lead and Gold_ and its sequels as a kid, and now I want to go back read them again. I really enjoyed this prequel. There's a lot of suspense and some though-provoking issues, not just in the sci-fi elements to the story (about the multi-stage invasion of earth by aliens), but also in the human relationships. Some young readers might find the book frightening, and others might find it insufficiently up-to-date (no mention of the internet or cell phones, for example). However, my son (a precocious 8 1/2) really, really liked _When the Tripods Came_, too. He even thanked me for giving it to him!"
4,A Great Book,"I HAVE JUST READ ""WHEN THE TRIPODS CAME"" AND I THINK THAT IT IS JUST A WONDERFUL BOOK. IT REALLY MAKES ME WANT TO READ ALL OF THE OTHER BOOKS THAT ARE IN THE TRIPODS TRILOGY. I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE. IT WAS WELL WRITTEN AND IT BROUGHT SUCH CLEAR PICTURES TO MIND! IF YOU HAVEN'T READ IT, THEN YOU BETTER GET YOURSELF TO THE NEAREST LIBRARY AND CHECK IT OUT! :)"
3,when the tripods came,When the tripods came is about two friends who wake up to seeing a big ship with three legs. A tripod. This is the beginning of the invasion. After shooting it down more and more invasions occur. Brainwashing even starts happening through a tv show called The Trippies. As more invade these two friends and their family find that Switzerland is the only non-invaded country. What happens in Switz erland. Find out for your self...
4,GREAT EXLPLANTATIONS!,"I thought this book was well written. Perhaps not as well as the rest of the series, but it holds many good answers to the series that the rest do not answer. Very good description on how the world was taken over. Very interesting on how un-capped humans came to live in the White Mountains. I do have one suggestion: Read the first three books before reading this one. I think the magic in the series is NOT knowing how the Tripods and Masters took over the earth. This book was written as a prequal, a book made to explain things that were left out in the other books. If you read this one first, I do think the rest of the series: The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire, will not hold as much magic and imagination if you had read it last. Very good, very thorough, but meant to be the last read."
3,Asterix and Obelix sans Romans in India,"You just have to like Asterix and Obelix! These guys could conquer the world in their sleep, but as long as their village is safe, there is no need to!In Asterix and the Magic Carpet, an Indian fakir seeks out their bard, Cacofonix, to return with him to to the Ganges and jump start the monsoon season. They agree, and the adventures begin.I didn't realize how much I enjoy the banter and interactions of the Gauls and the Romans. This is what defines the daily lives of Asterix and company, and is absent from this book. Asterix and Obelix with no Romans to harass? Say it ain't so!"
3,One of Uderzo's better solo efforts.,"Albert Uderzo, Asterix and the Magic Carpet (Dargaud, 1987)This is one of the three Asterix books I know I've already read during this marathon, but can't find any evidence I ever actually reviewed. Oops. In any case, a fakir has heard of Cacofonix's newfound ability to make rain fall with his singing, and heads off to the indomitable Gaulish village to seek his assistance. Along with Asterix and Obelix, Cacofonix accompanies the fair, Whatsisnehm, to India, passing a number of sites of their earlier exploits along the way. This is one to read after you've read the previous books in the series, otherwise there are a number of panels that won't make any sense. In any case, it's a pretty good entry in the series (and ""pretty good"" got more and more rare as Uderzo continued on, which makes this one something special). ***"
1,vhs,"had to pay extra for VHS? of all things and yet some significant parts were cut out!! (the ""humperware"" lady). Oh well don't buy porn classic or otherwise"
4,Good read,"I was required to get this book for class, it's actually a good read and does well for breaking things down for those of us who have never had accounting before."
4,My daughter loves this. I wish it was less expensive.,"My 8-month-old daughter loves this lovey in the candy pink color. She has a few other styles of security blankets, but never attached to them. She loves to rub this one on her cheek. It is very soft. Don't let the idea of fleece sway you away because it is the most plush fleece I've ever touched. My only complaint is the price. I guess you get what you pay for, right?! :)"
2,Disappointing,"This book purports to account for USRA and derivative equipment, and does a decent job of that. It is, however, completely joyless to read. The author complains time after time about poor and conflicting recordkeeping on the part of the builders and railroads about where the equipment actually went. Enough already-- a single disclaimer in the foreword or introduction (amply provided) would have sufficed! The author also takes a strong advocacy position in favor of the USRA designs, and completely dismisses the objections of the railroads. This may be justifiable in most cases, but what about the cases where the design really was flawed? And why must the reader be subjected to the author's defensive handwringing on this point so many times?Bottom line-- if you absolutely need a reference work on USRA equipment (but primarily in an accounting sense, and much less so in a technical sense), then buy the book. But don't expect to enjoy it."
4,Pretty Good,"This book concerns itself with the USRA-designed steam locomotives built in 1918-1920 (though not with the copies of those designs built from 1920 onwards). There is a brief introduction explaining why the USRA was necessary as well. The author devotes a chapter to each wheel arrangement, setting forth the existing designs that might have served as precedents and adding without elaboration the railroads' comments on the engines' performance.The style is rather dry and academic but at the same time there is more material on this subject here than in any other single book. Apparently accurate data is hard to come by, but it would have been nice to see production broken out by builder and type as well as allocation. The absence of this data is the book's most serious fault.The book includes a large number of interesting photographs. All in all, not perfect but a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in this era."
5,Funny & entertaining for all ages...,"As usual, Asterix books are funny and entertaining. Although I am 66 years old, I am still an avid reader of Asterix books. I read them along with my grand kids."
3,loose power connector,Despite the loose power connector to the main drive everything works great. Don't try to touch the power cord or connector after power is on otherwise it will be disconnected from the computer.A bit hot too.
2,Good Hard Drive,Very ugly design. Takes up a lot of room. The image on Amazon looks a lot better than it really is.As a backup drive is fine. Just find a place that you can hide it. I give it two stars because it does its job. But I would not get one of these again until they change their design.Alvaro
5,Excellent,"Looked around for a long time, had to go with what smartdisk, this is my third unit, I leave them on sometimes, never had a problem, never get too hot. Would not drop the unit and then complain like the other review, always a bad move."
5,"Lightweight, Fast, Reliable, and Quiet!","I love this drive. So far it has been great for temporary storage for creating my DVDs from my video camera and video conversion adapter (for my old Beta movies!). FireWire is the only way to go. And they are right about it being quiet. I only wish this drive would get its power from the computer rather than from a separate AC plugin (like the 100GB version does). Oh well, I still love it!"
1,"Old tech hardware, way outdated. way way outdated.","I should have read the specks closer and I would not have picked this piece of equipmnt. It is far too large and heavy for 250 GB. It does not work well w/ Mac. The accompanying software causes a crash each time its utilization is attempted. The product arrived w/out the required power cord. ( It took two weeks for that to arrive). I have the same company's lighter 80GB extrnl hard drive withwhich I'm pleased. Not a bad company, just a bad product."
5,great external hard drive,very user friendly. bought this to be able to save all my data in case of reformatting purposes. also to store extra music and what-not to not bogg down my laptop. works super fast and easy! great buy.
1,acidic foods leaves pit marks in the peice,I used this for veggies and dip. I guess the dip was acidic. It left little pit marks in the dip server.
3,"Great videos, good value, but not for fans.....","Videos by Tears for fears are great. This DVD is OK for people who like a bit of TFF but who are not interested in paying more than 10 $ for a few of the great songs and videos. Forget about extras at this price. 20th Century collection is for a collector of about every kind of music without being a big fan. With this serie of DVDs, you can get a few cheap priced DVDs with a short, but good content.Unfortunatly, videos on this DVD are not the best. A lot of content is missing. If you want a bit more, buy the official ""Tears Roll Down"" greatest hits videos. You will get twice as many videos. Sound quality is the same on both DVDs, same recording as on the CD.I gave *** because of the good value. The content is very short."
3,Are they for real?,"I guess this is for the real casual Tears For Fears fan. None of the videos from their album ""The Hurting"" are here at all. You get the major singles from ""Songs From The Big Chair,"" and one video from their 1989 album. It's very unsatisfying if you have seen all of their videos. I for one think the videos for ""Change"" and ""Pale Shelter"" are awesome. So if you just casually want to watch a few TFF videos and relive the 80's this might be for you but if you are a die hard fan you might be disapointed."
1,This DVD could have been so much more...............,"Wonderful DVD technology brings old videos to a new high-quality video format. And this DVD includes ONLY FIVE VIDEOS? Granted they are good videos, but wait a minute......... What about Mad World, Pale Shelter? What about Break It Down Again (my personal favorite), Cold, Elemental? What about Raoul and the Kings of Spain, Falling Down, God's Mistake? I was so excited when I saw the new DVD in a store, and then when I read the track listing on the back, my heart sank. What a waste! I should mention that's it's worth buying this DVD just for these five videos, but my heart is broken because the others were left out."
2,TOO SHORT,"I realize that this is a very inexpensive DVD, but I would be willing to pay much more for a COMPLETE video collection. Until that day comes (if ever), I'll just continue to watch videos for Pale Shelter and Mad World on VH-1 Classic..."
4,Classic Tears for Fears,"I miss the good ole' music videos. Glad they put this best of music videos out. This was truly the best of Tears for Fears. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't like ALL the videos but I liked most of them. The song ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" was a great song but the music video is just strange and doesn't fit with the song!! The rest of the dvd is pretty good. The songs are still classic to me!!"
4,Spin City is GREAT,"I love this show, and Michael J. Fox is just so entertaining to watch. I have the first three seasons of this show now, and eagerly awaiting Season 4... any word?"
5,Spin City,Awesome. Season three is probably the strongest of all of them. My wife has become a spin city fan from watching this season with me.
2,Offers nothing new to the genre,This is another generic book about generation gaps and Asian-American women. The book is also constrained by the fact that it's a memoir because there are too many names and irrelevant information. The prose is too flowery and the shift between the two narratives is confusing. There are far more superior and original storytelling in Samantha Lan Chang and Ha Jin's stories.
2,"Irritating narrative, badly written book","The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the ""I"", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her ""great destiny"" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative."
1,confusion abound,"The switch between who is telling the story was NOT clearly defined, and therefore confusing and hard to read. I myself is also a first generation immigrant and have also experienced the ""split"" personality"" of doing the ""Chinese thing"" veresus ""becoming westernized"". Besdies, I found some of Pang-Mei's statements about her choices for future mate extremely harsh-maybe a westerner, but he MUST know China, or a Chinese man who is westernized....take a chill pill, Pang-Mei! And get over it!!!! Embrace the best of both worlds and disgard the rest and don't look back! Not a good book. There are many others who are much better in storytelling than Miss Chang. Try Ha-Jin......"
4,Book Review,"""Bound Feet & Western Dress"" is about the life of a Chinese woman, Yu-i, and how she struggles to follow Western culture and modernise herself while still adhering to the Chinese custom of respect and submission. Yu-i was born ""in changing times"" in China, so she made it her personal goal to be the first female in her family to break the cultural norms like foot-binding and women not being allowed to have an education. It covers many events, from Chinese foot binding and weddings, to the first divorce of China and how Chinese women are expected to wholly defer to their family's and husband's expectations. It is wonderful how the author blended historic and modern events into one story, and showed how difficult it is for one person to make such a leap between the times. Many of the events and issues in the book paved the way for today's modern society. This book would definately appeal to readers interested in history or different cultures."
4,Bound Feet And Western Dress,"Bound Feet And Western Dress is a book that discusses the differences between the Chinese and the American culture. The main character, Yu-i is a Chinese woman who the reader follows through her life journey. Yu-i is forced to marry someone who she has never met and has no feelings for. Their marrige is an unhappy one and eventually ends, making the first Chinese divorce. After her marrige, Yu-i tries to become modern, but is still forced to cooperate with the obligations of her ex-husbands family. The novel is sucessful in displaying the Chinese culture in an interesting way. The book, however, is somewhat confusing due to its constant switching of time periods."
5,"The past and the present, east and west, in parallel.","Bound Feet & Western Dress is engaging and mesmerizing, as Chang tells the story in two voices, hers and her great-aunt Yu-i's. In switching between voices, the author is in turns heartbreaking and amusing. She manages to show that while footbinding may be a practice of the past, we in the present -- we who believe we are above such cruel practices -- have our own ways of binding and constricting ourselves. Yu-i spanned cultures and decades. By examining this woman's long life, her great-niece Pang-Mei finds lessons she can apply to her own future as a woman and as a writer"
5,plucking petals one by one,"i love this album so much. i just bought it the other day, used for fear that it would not live up to my expectations and i would regret paying full price, but i would gladly pay full price for this album. its pure genius. and so nice to see a girl getting rock so right. of course you have jenny lewis of rilo kiley as well who, in my opinion, can do no wrong. i think it is about time we see some more of this. sure i love conor oberst and tim kasher and think they are geniuses, but seeing women take over is a big relief! way to go girls! its a great album. words cannot describe, the last song on the album, is one to be treasured."
3,"Mirah, I Think It Is Like this ANNOYING !","This cd is O.K. By no means do I think it is a great cd. I tried to listen to it with my headphones, one song is nice and pleasant, then the next one just is loud and very annoying. Don't get me wrong their are some very good songs here, but you can only take so much filler. At times her voice is so annoying almost to the point of being unlistenable. I can't see how it could be listened to from start to finish, I couldn't do it. Beware of all the great reviews, like I said it is ok with a few really good songs"
1,If you are thinking of the 710 then please read,"When I purchased my 710 it was a new product and I paid double what the current price is. It sat nearly idle for almost a year and frankly hasn't been used daily like a real home office. Okay, so no bumps or scraps, no heavy use, and one day I start getting nothing but error messages, paper jam, document jam, cartridge jam. The software was removed from the PC and reinstalled several times, and I had a professional come to my home, whom by the way works for HP and diagnosed a mechanical problem, not a driver conflict. Believe it or not, the unit is at the San Diego HP office where these were built and they can't even figure out whats wrong. On a machine barely two years old with only limited use? Choose another HP product if you must, these have inherent flaws as was revealed to me by an anonymous HP employee."
2,I want to be a satisfied customer!,"August 28th, 2000 I called HP and upon hearing all of the wonderful news about the all ""NEW"" HP Pavillion, 6730 with an HP Office Jet, model 710, I could hardly resist buying it! I was told over the phone that I would receive EVERYTHING that I would need in order to hook it up and be ""computing"" in minutes, in addition I was told that I would have free 24/7 tech. support WRONG!!!I received a USED computer...some...I did not receive EVERYTHING that I needed..My office jet remains [messed] up and if that isn't enough..."
2,Not Good for Photos,"The thing is slow and noisy, but OK for general black printing.Since it is not a flat bed scanner, it runs the photos or documents past the scanner. If there is any dust at all on the scanner glass, stripes in the scan result. There are always stripes. Also. the little serrated wheels in the document feed scratch photos. It only has 600 x 300 color resolution, so photo printing is very disappointing. The optional photo cartridge gives slightly better quality photos, but has dull colors. Don't buy this if you want to scan or print photos."
4,With this and the Transcenders you too can pass!,"I was very skeptical when I first purchased this book. It's got Microsoft's name on the spine, which through past experience has shown to mean insufficent information or even abundance of errors. I was plesantly surprised to find the information not only sufficient, but also well written and mildly entertaining. Now you won't curl up with a cup of coffee and enjoy this book like a novel, but it certainly won't strain you brain with each chapter. As with all Technical Certifications, hands on usage is the best possible way to learn, I recommend installing SQL Server and working through all the examples. The only draw back to this book is the set of example questions, they lack the teeth that the test will truly have. So if you have the cash, go get the Transcenders.Good Luck!"
2,A Typical MS Press Book,"While one would think that buying a book from Microsoft Press is like getting the knowledge from the source, it is disappointing to find that the book is riddled with errors and shallow discussion of the most serious issues. If all you care about is passing the MS exam, this book may be enough. But, if you are trying to really learn MS Data Warehousing, then try another book. There are many better books on the market that provide deeper and much more useful examples and discussions."
4,"Hand Raisin', Booty Shaking Praisin'","Sweetbread is artfully layered with thoughtful, soulful praise that raises the listener to a higher place in mind and spirit. An artful mix of instrumentation and vocals that is promised to lead you on what is almost a spiritual journey of America's history.This is not a release to be easily ignored."
2,"sadly, no charts","I think there are many good fairly fine-gauge sweaters in this book that I would knit, with a few exceptions (there isn't anything in this book thicker than worsted, so no quick knits here.) Many of them are highly textured, but sadly, there are no charts. And since I'm a _very_ visual person, it just makes it that much harder to get the get-up and do one of these timeless designs. I'm working on my own charts so I'll actually know what I'm doing where on the cover sweater, but... I feel like I shouldn't have to.There are thirteen designs, and nine of them are highly textured, meaning to me, that I can't just put it down, go back later, look at it, and figure out where in the pattern I am. That, on more than a few sweaters, the design has no waist shaping, but it looks flattering on the models, showing curves nicely and disguising drop-shoulders. I don't go about with a clothespin in the middle of my back, and neither should the models. Gah."
4,Feminine designs,The value of this book is the beautiful stitches Ms. Mccauley has selected for her designs. Many readers will need to utilize the design 'sloppers' included to alter the insructions for a wider size range.
5,"If you have kintted your first sweater and want to move up, this book is it.","This book is great for someone who wants to try something a little more challinging but is familiar and comfortable with the basics. Some of the projects are a little more challenging but they all are beautifully fitted and well designed. In order for me to invest in a book, I have to be convinced that the designs in it will stand that test of time and changes in fashion. This book meets all criterias to become a classic."
1,Save your money,"The patterns are boring, unoriginal and uninspiring. The extra information is OK but, except for the exercises, it is covered better and more fully in other books. As I leafed through this book I found myself thinking, ""Yuck!, Yuck!, Yuck!"" Most of the patterns are in cotton which isn't as pleasurable to knit as wool. Furthermore, cotton handknits often don't look as good as wool. I wish I hadn't bought this book. I gave it to the library. Elizabeth Zimmerman's books are far, far better."
4,Good value.,"I would rate this product higher, if the soles lasted longer. The main use for these are actually for work boots. They are put through some extreme work environment conditions. One of them is on the highway, walking on asphalt. I suppose this is why the soles don't last as long as I would hope they would. Another is chemicals in the winter, such as brine, salt, calcium, & beet juice. Of course any of those chemicals are hard on all clothing products.For comfort I rate these top notch. Being this purchase was about my sixth pair of the 452's, I'm hesitant to even try anything else because there is literally no break in. Well, maybe a tad bit on the first day.No doubt in another 11 months or so, I will be purchasing another pair."
2,Almost Good,"Pros: fit, traction, foot comfort, flexibility, stability, light weight.Cons: Ankle slicing seam that I thought was just a break-in issue, but it's not. Socks look like a crime scene clean up rag. I could wear three pair of socks, but then I couldn't get my foot in the boot. Always liked Danner boots, but all my others were made in the U.S.A."
5,Great Shoe,I have to replace my shoes every 3 months. This Danner is the best style I have found for my particular problems. Service from Amazon is very good and the price for this style is $20 less than any other sight I checked.
5,Awesome,"Great pair of boots. They are true to size with ample room in the toe box. They are comfy right out the box, I am waiting for some snow in NY so that I can see how well they keep my feet warm."
4,Better than I expected,The girls are very funny in a Lucille Ball way. Good bit parts by Tia Carrera and Tom Arnold. Much better than your average teen comedy.
5,Brilliant,"What an ingenious and engaging book this is, and what a brilliant writer. Mr. Barth has had many imitators in his long career and very few real peers. I loved this book and have urged it on my friends. I hope we have many more Barth novels to look forward to."
1,"Going Soon, I Hope","The first 20 pages of Coming Soon was all I could tolerate. The author's use of obscure slang and 'clever' devices such as the 'book-within-a-book,' notes from the fictitious author and memos from his fictitious mentor combined to make a work of fiction so rambling and intensely annoying that I could not force myself to continue. If you love a good story, as I do, then you will probably find youself wondering, as I did, if the author will ever get to one. Coming Soon is a work likely to make many readers wonder ""Why am I not a published author?"" I recommend that you read ANYTHING by Larry McMurtry instead."
1,sad,"The least talented of the experimental or metafictional or postmodern fiction writers, Barth has delivered of himself another bloated and tiresome book. His tin ear has never been more sadly evident. On his very best day, he will never come close to Donald Barthelme on his very worst."
1,Would be nice if you could get the race you wanted,"It would be really nice if they could put out sets in single ethnicities. I do not like my child having multi-cult propaganda shoved down her throat via her TOYS! She wants to play with dolls that look like her - this is only natural. Too bad, cute set and I would have bought it."
2,Just an OK book,"First, it's a little outdated (2005).It is a good collection of many various topics, each chapter having it's own topic, author, and tone.It is a good sampling of spatial analysis techniques and areas of study.It has lots of good color pictures and flow charts.However, this book is dry, overly wordy and was not a good read. Some of the chapters were definitely better than others, which makes sense because of the different authors."
4,Introduction to India,"With this book the author declared her affections for India. It is done in a very unobtrusive, pleasant way. All a bit too general, but still moving. Maybe the better choice for foreigners."
1,Fluffy,"Lacking in depth and daring, this book is entirely unexceptional. Elsewhere one of the readers of Snakes and Ladders cites A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry, now that is a wonderful novel. It delivers more information, more emotion, more understanding than this little book of magazine-like essays. I was very disappointed in Snakes and Ladders, thought it a waste of time and money. Read a Fine Balance, it's glorious."
4,my son enjoyed this book,My son received this book as a gift when he was 10. He doesn't take to books real well but he really enjoyed this one. He rereads it often. I would recommend it for any child who strives to be funny.
1,DON'T LET YOUR KIDS READ THIS!,"The trend of celebrities penning books for children reaches its nadir with this one. There is nothing funny or interesting or the least bit intriguing about this book. I thought as an adult, maybe I'm out of the loop. Let me show it to some kids. So I did. And they hated it!Jay Leno can't make adults laugh, let alone children. The book is also in bad taste. Some of the jokes here woujld be offensive to children with their innuendo. What in the world were they thinking when they published this?I wish I could give it zero stars!"
3,Be Aware That This Is A Joke Book,I didn't realize this was a joke book and bought it for an adult that claims he is the funniest man in the world. I didn't do my homework and thought this was Mr Leno's autobiography. I returned it promptly.
4,"lots of info, but focused on newborn adoption","I read great reviews on this book, that's what aided in my decision to buy it. I felt that the book had lots of great info., but it was focused on adopting newborns."
3,Nothing new here.,"Richard Mintzer, Yes, You Can Adopt Carroll and Graf, 2003)Another book that wants to be a one-stop shop for everything adoption-related. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's been done, and better (Falker's The Ultimate Insider's Guide to Adoption still ranks as the top of the heap). Mintzer's strength here is in including a good number of snippets of interviews with families, giving a personal face to the experiences he talks about in the book. Once again, as with most adoption books, only half of this will apply to you, depending on whether you're doing domestic or international adoption, so you might want to give this one a look-over at the library before shelling out the dough. ***"
2,"""Best of"" - yeah right","Some fine stuff here for sure, but calling this ""best of"" is ridiculous. Far too many great/classic Tom Scott tunes missing. I hope he doesn't start following a ""Yes"" strategy, ie coming out with 800 ""best of"" albums......"
4,Was looking for 1970/80s Tom Scott music,"This album is ok, but I was trying to re-experience some music I heard of his from the late 70's early 80's and was disappointed it was not on this CD. Can't seem to find that old of his music anywhere :("
5,My favorite CD of all time...,"This is, simply put, my favorite CD of all my music, and I have a lot. I have a bachelors degree in music and though my education was in classical music I find this music transcends all but the most sublime music in the classical world. I, like the reviewer Leja, just ran across this music by chance when it was given to me by a co-worker because he thought I'd enjoy it. Well, that was in about 1986 and for the last 23 years I have listened to this CD at least once per week if not more. It is evocative of certain places to which I like to travel and I wouldn't leave home without it on a vacation. I have lent out so many copies that I am on Amazon now to buy another so I can have a personal copy again."
5,Classic Vollenweider,This is classic Andreas Vollenweider and it is just as timeless as it was 25 years ago. Ephereal and enchanting!
3,Just okay,"I bought this old one of his because I don't like what he is doing now. The CD is very short, even though they give a large number of songs, some songs are around one minute. Most of my CDs are twice this long."
3,Close to ho-hum...,"...and certainly sophomoric, I must admit that this book is still a better read than the usual supercilious pedantry of the Earnest Aspiring ProgBoy Writer. The best part: Broof decks Squire. God knows Fishy had it coming; don't you agree?"
3,Cobbled together news articles shed little light,"I have to agree with most of the reviews here; mostly personality and business problems, little on the construction of what is some of the most complex music of the 20th century.The book is best when Welch talks about the early years of the band; how they started, where they came from. After the Yes Album, a lot of the book seems concerned with chart numbers, gold and platinum sales, accounting discrepencies, and first-class trips to Bermuda. A lot of this material reads as if Welch had just boilerplated his original articles into book form with little or no editing.Paul Stump does better with less, and we get a strong picture of the music. Not here. Funny vegetarian stories and Trevor Rabin's musical awards."
3,MOUNTAINS COME OUT OF THE SKY AND THEY STAND THERE,"My favorite progressive rock band from the 1970s as money grubbing spoiled rock stars? Yes? No! The author certainly loves the band but reveals them as quite human after all, blowing the lid off the Yes mystique of cosmic peace and mind altering exploration, as they scramble to keep pace with changing public musical tastes and advancing middle age. Even after reading ""Close To The Edge, The Story of Yes"", the band members remain as strangers coming across as mere participants in the great machine called Yes, and as less than mature men who blame all their troubles on everyone but themselves. The author's narrative rolls along serving Yes information, however tedious to the unadorned, in an enjoyable way until the end when he suddenly dropa out of sight allowing the concluding chapter to serve as a promotion for the band's new album. One wonders if the band's participation for the book was dependent on that promotion."
1,One Star,"This video is too scary for young children. Raggedy Ann is about adventure and a pretend world, helping others and fantasy, but this video depicts mean and deceptive personalities threatening the good characters - not characteristic of the original Raggedy Ann stories. When young children hide and don't want to watch it, that's indicative of the quality."
3,Good Workout for your lighter days,I like this workout. But the cardio section is too short in the beginners version so i rewind and do it twice. The advanced is adequate in length. Not enough ab work or leg work. Arms are done with no weights. Its a nice workout for your lighter days and the aerobics will make you break a sweat.
5,Jane Fonda New Workout,THis video was received in good condition and I would definitely order from the this seller again.
4,Best workout tape I have ever bought!,"This is the best workout tape I have ever bought. I read all the reviews on amazon and I was curious what everyone one was talking about, now I know. This video is encouraging, it really make you push yourself. I really hate cardio workouts with steps that go on forever. However this cardio is fast upbeat and a challenge. The toning segments, despite being over a decade old are still a challenge. I recommend this video if you really need that extra push to get your exercise routine going. This tape features two workouts it is worth the investment."
4,Original,"This video is really challanging, and you must be quite fit in order to complete it. However it is worth the money, and I would recommend it to the advanced exerciser. This video is unique as one of the choreographers actually sings a little song in the warm up. This appears quite annoying at first, but suprisingly I have come to like it. There is a beginners and advanced workout. Quite truthfully the beginners workout is quite advanced! Both workouts have a warm up, waist exercises, arm exercises, aerobics (which is longer in the advanced section), followed by toning for the legs, abdominals and buttocks. There is a short cool down. This video is clearly very original, and this is what I like best about it. It may be quite dated but it is really fun to do! I would recommend this video for anyone who enjoys high impact aerobics."
4,This thing SUCKS!,"Very nice vaccuum, great features, and it'll suck the chrome of a trailer hitch. The extended hose is a nice option - it'll stretch a good 20 feet or more. The handle-mounted on-off switch is very convenient. Only downside that i can figure is cleaning the non-bag canister can be messy and dusty - but what vaccuum really overcomes this anyway?"
2,Too dirty,"I bought this because it was highest rated by Good Housekeeping.I should have went to Walmart and bought something cheaper. I have had problems with it clogging up with normal use. It is very messy to empty. The filter while effective when vacuuming, emptying it sends all the dust back into the air and it still looks dirty. It does pick up good but has to be emptied very frequently or it loses suction. I have to empty after every room and I don't live in large house. I am looking to replace this expensive mistake."
3,Lifetime belt lasted one week,"I bought this vacuum a couple weeks ago and took it back for a refund. The third time I used it it started making an awful noise. After I checked it out, I found that quite a few of the ""teeth"" on the lifetime belt were missing. I decided that I would keep the vaccuum because it really does do a great job of cleaning the carpet. However, when I went to get a new belt for it, I couldn't find one. I looked in the owner's manual and they don't list a belt replacement. Just said to go to an authorized dealer and have it repaired. I live 100 miles from the closest dealer and decided that it just wasn't worth it. With the exception of the broked lifetime belt, it is a great vacuum. I was amazed how much dirt it picked up after I vacuumed with my Bissel and then went back and vaccuumed with the Savvy. So, great vacuum. poor lifetime belt."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I ordered this vacuum because it was highest recommended by the Good Housekeeping Institute. Although expensive, I figured it was worth the investment. What a disappointment! It is extremely heavy to manouvre on carpets, although it picks-up well on them. It is hopeless at picking-up on hard-wood floors... I have reverted to a dustpan and brush! The second time I used this vacuum, the holder that supports the extension wands broke off, which meant it could no longer store the tools. Although Hoover supplied a replacement part, this did not fit and had to be modified by my husband. Overall verdict? Save your money and buy cheaper!"
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.......a waste of money","Every 5 or 6 months since it was bought, the motor that drove the brushes broke down. After the second time, it was in the dirty alley ready to join the other trash. It is too heavy, too hard to use. No belt, new technology that doesnt work effectively at all. It doesnt clean worth a damn. Ive turned to a 50 dollar eureka, works great. I would not recommend this unit to my worst enemy. It is that terrible!!"
2,Don't buy it. Too much time spent fixing it.,"I bought this thing as an upgrade...to one advertised as beltless, hence no belt to break. 6 months later, I had to replace the belt that didn't exist and had a hard time finding it, since Hoover didn't have one for the machine without it. 5 months later I replaced it again. Now 1.5 months later, the vacuum motor is toast. I can't find that online, very easily, and never heard a complaint about those Dyson machines, so we're upgrading again."
5,No problems here...,"I bought this vacuum a year ago and it works just as great now as it did the day I bought it. I've never had any problems with it and I love the fact that I can use it with a bag or without. I'm kind of baffled by all the negative reviews that this vac received, as I use mine nearly everyday and it still works perfectly. I paid 199.00 for mine and I think it's been worth every penny."
3,Savvy Vacuum- this is a very heavy machine!,"The vacuum is much, much heavier than I anticipated. It is very difficult, basically impossible, to use on our carpeting and much too heavy for my wife to use, ever. The machine has super pick up power, but is too heavy and combersome to really be effectively used by older people and by many women. The attachments are super."
3,Culture Shock,"I was disappointed in the book, because I thought the title was misleading. I expected more of an in depth analysis between Malaysian culture and the west. This is written as a travel guide. It is very informative if someone should go and live in Malaysia, but it should have been presented in that way."
4,Pretty good products,"The bracket fit the slots so I could install my shelf, but there is quite a bit of looseness compared to the other brackets I had bought about 10 years ago, but will do the job."
4,Very good system,I've been using this shelving system for about 8 years and I'm very happy with it. I originally purchased most of my pieces at a chain home improvement store. I needed to get some additional shelf brackets to expand the system and was only able to find them online. I've been using the system as a lumber rack and it's worked very well. The only thing that prevents me from giving 5 stars is that the brackets aren't as thick as they used to be. I measured a sampling of my old and new brackets with calipers and the old brackets are 30%+ thicker than the new. The load rating is the same and the new brackets are still very sturdy. (The old and new brackets have the same model number and UPC code.)
4,John Sterling Fast Mount Systems,"I had originally purchased the JS Fast Mount supports and rails at a chain home improvement center. The durability, ""heft"" and flexibility were selling points for me as I used the system in my outbuilding wood shop. Amazon was great to be able to find the additional supports I needed, the HI center discontinued selling this brand and the ones they did have did not have near the durability. While I had not realized that there were varied sizes, the 11"" bracket fit my shelves without any modifications. JS got the order and delivered in very short time without the need for overnights or more expensive shipping. Bottom line, very pleased and thankful to have been able to find them."
3,Novice bonsai tools,"Great for a beginner but require some work to maintain with no corrosion or rust, ie. use a fibertex pad will greatly help keep clean."
5,A nice commentary about dealing with cancer in children.,Dr. Lazarus gives a good commentary on how medicine is more than just administering RX to patients. It goes so much furthur than that. Dr. Lazarus shares some heartwarming stories about his road in the pediatric oncology world. It also reveals why a doctor would choose this specialization. I for one am glad he did.
3,A mixed bag,"I purchased this book based on the author's reputation. I have mixed feelings about the book.Yes, there are some technical inaccuracies. However, none (so far) are fatal and most seem to been due to oversights in the editing process.Each of the chapters starts with an ""In-depth"" section that reviews the chapter's contents. While I hesitate to describe much of the material as ""in depth""; this section of each chapter does a reasonably good job of overviewing the material. More than wading, but not deep either. More like waist deep.The rest of each chapter provides step by step instructions to tasks related to the chapters material. Most of these ""solutions"" provide a step by step instuction to complete some task.This book is not meant to be a MCSE test prep tool. For a beginning to intermediate level network administrator or for a recent NT 4 to Windows 2000 convertee, there is a lot of useful ""get the job done"" information."
1,Much Better Win2K Admin Books Available,"It really looks like the authors took the help screens available in Windows 2000 and simply reorganized the material. Very little analysis or depth is provided. While not bad, it is very weak in comparision with other available books. If you are going to spend the money on a valuable resource, then look at some other alternatives. For a basic admin overview, get ""Windows 2000 Administration for Dummies."" My clear recommendation for the best immediate to advanced reference is ""The Ultimate Windows 2000 System Administrator's Guide."" The Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit is also a good but expensive alternative. DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS BOOK ... look at the superior alternatives."
4,Better then trying to wade through the NT 2000 ResKit,Love the layout. Made it easy to find what I was looking for.I also have the Microsoft Press 2000 ResKit... found the black book a lot easier to use...
1,Too Simple,"I returned it the day I got it. While thumbing through it, I found that most of the book is simply stepping you through config. screens/menus without explanations of the options that need to be set. The registry sections seemed fairly robust but almost all of the keys I saw were ones configurable using group policy. Sorry, won't be on my bookshelf."
5,Unfinished Life,"This movie really touched on so many important issues, i.e. loss of a loved one, forgiveness, loyalty, friendship and family. Each individual had their issues and everyone came together with their pain and sorrow in the beautiful but harsh landscape of Wyoming to forgive, forget and grow together. It reminded me of the Western movies of the 50s which I grew up with where justice is served plain and simple, no place for the faint of heart."
4,Very good movie.,"Rating is 3.65 because of commendable cast effort which was commandeered by Redford (movie is 83.9% Redford) and because the feature dramatically imparted significant life themes of self-reflection, the common denominator of human error and redemption through forgiveness (to include self-forgiveness). Depite a few implausibilities and what smacked of The Horse Whisperer rehash scenes (which were however on-key in light of the plot and of equal digestive quality), the feature came across as very believable, accurately portrayed the small-town flavor of a big sky State, lent warmth and credence to the struggling human spirit and imparted a lesson worth taking to heart."
4,This was a gift,Bought this for my husband. He really liked the move and the service provided was spot on. What more can I say
5,J.LO Wow again....Semi,Pretty good movie. Story was funny as hell and I like the acting. Wasn't her best film but it was good enough.
5,Yup,"This is a great movie that was very difficilt to find and still be affordable. As an older movie that's been on TV dozens of times, yet certainly not lately, it's a great addition for my movie collection."
3,Disappointed,This is NOT a 1.85:1 aspect movie as stated. It is a 2.40.... Very disappointed because I don't like widescreen anddon't have a newer TV to accommodate this style well.
4,Enjoyed the movie,"Great movie, strong actors good story line....bart the bear is awesome in this movie his handlers treat him well love watching him"
4,Deserves More Praise,"I thoroughly enjoyed this creation. A believable story told by outstanding actors.And guys, if you think this is just a chick flick, watch and see how Redford takes care of the bad guy."
5,An Unfinished Life,"I loved this movie.It was a great story,and entertaining.I like movies that make you feel good, and this was one of the best I had seen in a while. They really need to make more like this one."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I picked it up only because it was filmed in and around the small town where I grew up: Ashcroft, B.C., Canada. (Sorry, people, but that's not really Wyoming.) It was actually a pleasant, thoughtful little film with some fine acting. Too bad the studio didn't try to market it when it was released in theatres."
5,An Unfinished Life,"Great movie. This is not an action picture. The dialog, acting and story line are excellent. Beautiful scenery. A well told story of an unfinished life, a broken life on hold."
5,Robert Redford channeling John Wayne,"Really nice story about family and forgiveness. Lopez is great as the desperate mom looking for sanctuary for herself and her daughter in the last place she wants to go, and Redford and Freeman make terrific buddies. The scene in the cafe where the drunks harass Manheim and Redford steps in is really powerful, it's like he's channeling John Wayne, only stronger and more silent. Also gotta love the way Lopez's ex is handled, too. Cowboys were, cowboys are, cowboys will be...cowboys. Even if they do ride a bicycle."
2,Made for TV kind of movie,"One would expect a lot from the film that is casting stars like: Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Lopez. Alas, this film follows every possible formula that there can be in Hollywood. Rugged handsome rancher (Redford), hollier than thou ranchhand (Freeman) and floozy mom with pre-teen daughter (Lopez) have one thing in common: their lives were transformed by the death of young Griffin who was Lopez's husband, young Griff's father and son of the Redford's character. All characters have difficult time adjusting to each other since everyone's mere existance is a constant reminder of what could have been if the young Griffin was not killed in the car accident. But the plot is so predictive that this film falls into category of the made for TV movies. Quite a disappointment."
4,Really good dramatic film,"This film was a really great drama with a really strong cast. I am not usually impressed with J.Lo as an actress but she did a fine job here. The relationships are really strong in the story, well-defined, something for all ages. There are male friendships, female friendships....tension.....forgiveness....Camryn Manheim from Private Practice is also a great actress with a great character story here. I really enjoyed it and the beautiful landscapes as well."
3,An Unfinished Life: 3.5 stars,"Abused by her boyfriend, Jean Gilkyson (Jennifer Lopez) and her daughter Griff (newcomer Becca Gardner) runs away to her estranged father-in-law Einar (Robert Redford). Because of a grudge, Einar doesn't give Jean the time of day. Within time, they learn to forgive each other and live happily ever after."
4,Better second time around,"I think I tried to watch this movie before,but never quite got hooked. If you watch past the first 5 minutes it's really worth it. I like the theme of second chances and person can be more than what they initially seem to be. I highly recommend this movie."
5,touching...riveting...moving...excellent,"This film has everything you'd never expect in such a simple story....exceptional acting, perfect casting, great location shots, a touching storyline....what else needs to be said?When you combine the acting skills of Redford & Freeman in a realistic, gritty story...you end up with this elegant film!This director really knows how to move an audience...and he does another fine job of it here. His other films include ""The Cider House Rules""...which is another 5 star film.This film is a winner!"
1,Standardized Tear Jerker - Feel good movie,"Let the attacks begin!Tear Herkers: easiest movies to make. And in Hollywood and they know it. Just get a puppy and squish him in the middle of the road. I call em squished puppy movies. If you don't have an idea make a squished puppy movie.Bwwwwa! Tears!Movies like this are the equivalent of a bad video game. The keep you occupied for 2 hours but afterwords nothing in your life has changed. You might as well take two hours off your life. It's just a lost void. Take heroin for the same effect.And J-Lo? An animal movie from a corporation (J-Lo is a corporation) that sells furs from animals skinned alive? J-Lo is all about money and will do anything for it. Look it up on the internet. She will even ""try"" to act!"
4,Outstanding movie,"I am not a Jennifer Lopez fan, but in this film she is excellent and this movie is very good!"
4,Very good,"I needed a movie to watch on the plane. I downloaded this movie to my iPad and watched it during the flight.A very good movie, would definitely suggest it."
1,Total Skanks,"I ordered this for my 16-year-old daughter (I'm her Dad), but when someone brought concerns to me about it, I screened it before giving it to her, and I was disgusted with these women and this disk. I never gave it to her, but ended up throwing it out and eating the cost."
2,Not Enough of the Dolls,"I'm a big fan of the dolls but this was not at all what i wanted..... I liked the songs that it had but you really can't call this a concert..... I'm looking foward to the day the lable releases the live stadium dvd that has songs performed by ""ALL THE DOLLS"" the true fans know each one of the dolls has great songs......"
2,So so,"Maybe this group should have waited awhile before producing a live concert DVD. The production values on this one were really amateur. Very small club, no pizazz or good lighting. Kind of like watching a show at your neighborhood bar. I expected more and wouldn't buy another of their DVD's."
1,Don't order this!,"Although it says medium here, what you will receive is clearly labelled as small. When you return the incorrect item, you are charged a 10% restocking fee, and not refunded your ""expedited"" shipping (6 business days is not what I'd call expedited) even though the Leather Tree sent the wrong item. Don't do buisness with them."
5,Helpful Book for Blending Families,"I might not have a Ph.D or specialize in anything other than being the best parent I can possibly be to my two children, as well as to my significant others three children, however I can tell you, this book is an excellent read.Although tailored to the step or blended family, any parent would find much of the information useful.Understanding birth order can seriously change how you parent, having a more positive impact on your children involved in the blending family. The whole saying ""Everyone has a place in this world"", will never ring more true, until you have taken the time to read Kevin Leman's books.I have read over 20 other books geared towards step families, step mothers, blended families and this is the book I reach for constantly. It has made the biggest impact on our family, in an extremely positive way.I highly recommend this book or any book by Kevin Leman for any blended family."
5,Great for Homeowner,"Although I would not recommend this tool box for a professional shop, it is a nice product for the average homeowner handyman. I've had mine for almost a year and have been very pleased. The drawers work well and it has plenty of space for all of my wrenches, sockets, pliers, etc. The bottom drawer is deep enough to store my cordless drill set. If you want something that will hold up with constant use in a professional shop then you will need to spend 2 or 3 times more money. But if you're just an average handyman around your home reaching for your pliers or sockets once a week, then this is a great tool chest for the price."
3,Good movie for the time.,"I may be little biased about this movie as it was filmed at my high school in Madison, WI during the Spring of 1979. I was a freshman and and classes basically were all skipped during filming. They had the trailers out front, and would wet down the streets with huge water trucks. Some of my friends were used as extras and one friends house was used for Lance Kerwin's house.The movie is good overall, really telling the story of the times when everybody was drinking and smoking too much, even our star athletes. It's worth a look."
5,Excellent Alternative,"Works great, holds a charge just as long as the original and at half the price an excellent alternative.............=D"
5,I think I'm addicted.,"I have recently returned to nutritional yeast. I ate it once in a while as a kid (hippy parents - more or less), but I rediscovered it again. I love it on popcorn, in soup, on salads (in addition to dressing). I'ts better too if you add salt to whatever you're eating it with. The food co-op I work at sells a locally made vegan nacho cheese made with potatoes, carrots, cashews, jalapenos and nutritional yeast. It's awesome!Don't expect it to taste like a protein shake 'caus it's not a protein shake. Don't mix it with milk! EVER! Or water, or fruity shakes... That's ridiculous. Mix it with salty food.Not everyone's going to like it, but many will probably get hooked."
5,LOVE it.,"I love nutritional yeast on salads, in my salsa, in ""cheese,"" in pasta sauce, sprinkled on garlic toast, in anything salty or spicy. MMmmm!"
2,Just this brand I think,"I've had a couple different brands of Nutritional Yeast, and this one isn't that great. The flavor is off, and it tastes disgusting...would never buy this brand again. I do like some of Now Foods other products but their nutritional yeast isn't good."
3,"Not my cup of tea, but good for my vegan friend","A vegan friend recommended this to me, saying it's highly nutritious and yummy. I didn't enjoy it much so I gave it to her in the end and she loves the stuff.So if you like this kinda stuff and are vegan it may be a good product for you."
5,Not like parmesan cheese - AT ALL,"I bought these flakes for a vegan recipe, since they are supposed to be a good substitute for parmesan cheese. Um, not so much. NOW products are wonderful. However, if you're trying to play nice with the vegans, this may be a little too ""out there"" for those who fondly remember paremesan cheese.The container was much larger than I realized, which is a good thing if you're really into Nutritional Yeast Flakes. For me though, what the heck am I going to do with this stuff?!"
1,AWFUL!!!!,"I've tried mixing w/ milk, water, & a berry smoothie, but they are so disgusting, I can't bring myself to get it down. My gag reflex kicks in just thinking about it. Container is huge."
5,Cats love it!,"I bought these because I read that some cats like it. Three of my four cats do like it. I wanted to get something to sprinkle on their raw food and grain-free canned food to entice them to eat it, and this stuff does the trick. The ones that like it, can't seem to get enough of it. They do sometimes lick it off the food and then not eat the food! But usually it gets them started and they will eat at least some of their healthy food."
5,Summary,I can't get this stuff at my home town grocery and this keeps me from having to drive out of town.
3,"Not cheddar, but not bad","I got these to make cheesy things based on a cookbook that I bought. The results were not what I expected. It's not cheesy, but it's close. Since I have discovered that I am lactose intolerant, I will just have to learn to like the taste."
2,La Princesa Dora es muy loud,My daughter loves the magic wand (she's a princess of course) but the stupid wand will not stay on the book and I don't see the educational value of the constant (brnnng brnng) sound. Would not purchase again.
4,Great follow-up,"""Nie Wierzcie Elektrykom"" is a great follow up to the band's debut release. It demonstarte's their raw energy and great creativity before being subject to major label dylemas. The styles vary from song to song and the humor is constant. It's a nice window to see what was happening in Poland at the time of when the songs on this album were written. You can not take it too seriously, if you do you'll be disappointed."
5,An incredible surprise,"Read this book while backpacking in New Zealand. I was choosing from a hostel shelf, and was torn between some classic novel, and this. I took a chance and I'm so glad I did.This is one of the weirdest and best books I have read in a long time. It's plot may be about talking dogs, but it is really about the incredible nature of the human condition. It explores the passion it takes to be sucessful and creative and exposes the tipping point where that falls into insanity and madness.Warning: It is incredibly hard to convince others to read this book, due to the bizarre plot synopsis, so, once you discover and enjoy it, it will likely stay your little secret.Enjoy!"
4,"Refreshing originality, story is told plainly and obviously","What a refreshing way to look at an old theme! It was so plainly told and easy to comprehend I found myself halfway through without noticing. It was powerful enough that i caught myself pondering about it at odd moments but it didn't go for the obvious play on emotions like many novels do today. No crippled children, no widowed lovers, just a plain, touching story about animals we take for granted and what one man's obsession wrought. How horrible it would be to play God."
2,Disappointing,"Like so many others, I ""bit"" the promotional brouhahaabout this book. As a lover of humans, dogs and New York, I expecteda lot more depth, and a lot more tying of loose ends. The ending was horrible, and the events leading up to it were never clearly resolved. It's almost as though Ms. Bakis got tired of writing, and wanted to finish quickly. Unfortunately, the glowing recommendations, and the disappointing reality make it difficult for me to hold great faith in other reviews. I guess I'll have to return to my old standby: The New York Times, and particularly Michiko Kakutani."
4,"Great creativity, so-so execution","A terrific concept (even in the eyes of this cat lover). The dogs are wonderfully original and the idea is a great update of the Frankenstein story.The writing is a little more inconsistent but still plenty impressive for a first novel. I, for one, didn't care for the opera at all but it takes all kinds of readers.In summary, a good read which I'm glad I found at the library. I'll recommend it to my friends who have a good imagination and the patience to read the book for the details that make it rich."
2,BIZARRE,"This book begins with a good premise, however a good premise not well executed leaves much to be desired. The main character is not at all well developed and deserving of absolutely no sympathy. The plot meanders and eventually trails off into bits and pieces with an extremely unsatisfying ending. I did, however, think the author deserved two stars for her clear writing style. Perhaps one should approach a debut novel with a little less originality."
3,Good but it could've been longer,"I won't agree with it being in the ""horror"" genre, considering there's nothing scary about the book. I would consider it more a ""sci-fi"" then anything. Only thing I suggest is read it because you're interested, regardless on what genre it is.I'm not going to say what the book's about, considering you can read that with other reviews, but mention what I feel about the book. I thought the book was interesting. The only thing I wished Kirsten Bakis would've done was make it a little longer and got deeper into some of the characters' lives; IE, maybe get deeper in the relationship between Cleo and Ludwig.I wouldn't mind reading a sequel to this book."
2,Idea: 5 stars; Implementation: 2 stars,"I agree with the many reviewers who were captivated by the author's creative idea. I wish the writing and the plot lived up to it. Perhaps if the basic premise weren't so intriguing, there would be less disappointment. But, I still read the whole thing. Optimism dies hard."
2,Don't waste your time...,"While the idea of dogs acting, feeling, thinking like humans is intriguing and certainly different, the level of writing in the book is unbearable. I have to say though, as a writer myself, it gave me hope. If this awful stuff can get published and get such unbelievable reviews, there's hope for all of us out there. We read it in my book group and the decision was unanimous -- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,the work of an amateur,"I bought this book for the sake of the audacity of the concept. I (foolishly) thought that an idea this ridiculous must have something really exciting to redeem it in order to make it publishable, but simply stated, this is awful.Our suspension of disbelief wears off under the burden of implausibility never mitigated by any skillful artifice of the author, and soon there is just no getting past the perfectly dreadful prose. I found myself editing nearly every sentence, trying to shape those leaden and so often misaligned words into something a little more bearable. The plot(?) is just as amateurish as the prose, and the denouement is worse. No real need to go on about this monstrosity; I hated nearly everything about this in the end, and I found myself incredulous and angry that it had even been published."
3,My guess is that writers are a pompous lot,"Of course I haven't prejudiced my review in any way by actually READING this book, but I just had to note that the character ""Augustus Rank"" would, in my old neighborhood, be referred to by the more insightful name of ""Big Stink."""
2,"Great premise, very poor execution...","The idea of writing a novel about a race of soldier dogs perfected by a mad scientist should be enough for a decent science-fiction book... But in this title, the story comes together in a very poor manner... It is told from several points of view, and they all do not come together nicely at all... For instance, the man to whom the leader of the rebellion (Mops Hacker) is given a sa puppy, is chosen by Mops previous master because 'she had a strange fondness for Jedediah, whom she had several times caught in secret acts of kindness;' It turns out later that this Jedediah is a brute that is constantly beating Mops... Like these, the book is plagued with inconsistencies in its characters, and this reflects in the overall quality of this novel..."
2,ARF,Just the cover art and GREAT idea gave it 2 stars up front. And anything added to that would have been icing on the doggie biscuit... but the complete lack of doggie/person understanding that anyone who has ever enjoyed the company of ANY animal knows about is simply not there. Not in the least. Humans and animals communicate SO MUCH better than the fake dialogue here. And the sumptuous halls and limos and helicopters and panting (get it?) reporters just added to the lie. Such a fertile idea gone bad. BAD DOG!!
5,A triumph,"It has been a long time since I have read a novel as fascinating and as moving as this. I cried my way through the last fifty pages, and thinking of some of the passages would make me start crying anew hours later. The difficulty of being neither human nor beast is given a fresh and poignant treatment. The characters are brought to life so believably that, as I read, I felt as though I had actually met Ludwig, the monster dog, and when I put the book down, I truly missed him. I recommend this book without reservations"
5,wow... fantasy at it's best,"If i had an ambition to write a book, this is the kind of book i would love to write.Are there more books like this one??"
2,An intriguing premise leads to disappointment,"I bought this book after I heard it described on NPR; I thought any first novel with a title that good was worth a look. Unfortunately, the execution fails to live up to the premise. The writing is often thin, as in the frequent fictional excerpts from newspapers and magazine or journal entries in which the author's tentative voice never adapts to the tone of the purported source. The plot, which proceeds briskly, never really goes anywhere -- there are hints of sinister secrets that are simply left hanging, foreshadowing of malevolent intentions that either never surface or are frustrated too easily. The novel ends up feeling like a story that gets by on an eye-catching premise and nothing more.As a footnote, the premise never really adds up anyway. Why would anyone think that walking, talking, intelligent dogs would be the perfect super-soldier? Why not robots? Or gorillas? Or chimpanzees? Or, or, or... robots?"
2,Distinctively unoriginal,"It is unfortunate that this book has received such wide publicity. There are too many good books out there and too little time to read them all. Hailed as original and inventive, it is a pale copycat of much finer works. For those seeking originality, read Patrick Suskind's Perfume, or anything by Philip K. Dick. But please do not waste your time on this predictable, ill-written drivel. Cujo is turning over in his grave."
1,Monster Dogs tries so hard but accomplishes so little,"Like a movie whose trailer is much more satisfying than the actual film, Monster Dogs entices with the superb cover art and interesting premise but leaves the reader disappointed. In a futile attempt at providing enlightening commentary on such aspects of the human condition as celebrity, belonging, and friendship, Monster Dogs ultimately can't get out of its own way. In her efforts to be profound the author ignores any attempt at telling an interesting story. One example is the scattering of dream sequences throughout the story which serve only to be cryptic abstract excursions that reveal nothing of value or interset about the narrator. In the beginning, Monster Dogs promising to be a fun and enjoyable read, but in the end fails miserably to deliver."
2,It's a dog,"I really wanted to like this book. A wonderfully creative concept serves as the story's skeleton, but the author's writing and plotting failed to bring the creation to life for me. Her prose style is occasionally luminous, but not often enough so to make up for gaping plot holes, a lackluster pace, and a weak-willed protagonist. Ultimately an unsatisfying read made all the more disappointing by the squandered potential of its high concept and an obviously talented writer unable to quite fit all the pieces together in this debut novel."
3,"Strong Start, Poor Finish","I really got into this book. It is a strongly conceived story and rolls along like the odd concoction of ""writings"" that it is. Unfortunately, the sections from Cleo Pira's p.o.v. are weakest and as she has the last fourth of the book all to herself, it really falls apart. I almost got the feeling that Bakis' ran out of ideas, or that she just polished off the end because she'd already sold the book on its first part. Very disappointing. The ending is so stupidly hallucinatory and lacking in finality that I had to come back to it later and reread the ending just to make sure I didn't dream it. However, I was right. It was awful. And yet... I ripped through the beginning. Interesting example of first time novel writing."
2,Concept with enormous potential thwarted by amateur writing & lack of forethoughtf,"I was intrigued by the idea but it was so poorly written that I was frustrated, almost angry, that the author failed to deliver. The book felt like an under-worked high school creative writing project."
3,A great read! Pity about the ending,"This is a book which I thought had stacks of potential, delivered for the most part and then ended in an anti-climax. Although not a traditional novel, the writing style was very fluid and was an easy read from cover to cover. The main strength of the novel is how it manages to make something so incredible actually believable. But the ending seemed to suggest that the author didn't know how to end it. All in all, a good read"
3,Great idea; needs more work,"Overall, I enjoyed _Lives_. I read the book over this weekend and decided that despite its flaws, it's a keeper. As a historian/folklorist who specializes in German culture, I was attracted by the idea of Prussian dogs with their own culture, customs, etc. Kudos to Bakis for such an excellent idea! Her story starts strong but then sort of fizzles out at the end. I really wish Bakis had developed the relationship between Cleo and Ludwig more, as it seems to be the heart of the story. If she had spent more time rewriting, Bakis could have made _Lives_ into an epic and explored all the nuances that make a great story. The idea deserves more depth. But I'm keeping the book, and will re-read it, to enjoy the idea of talking dogs in uniform, and to remind myself that good ideas in writing need more time and development."
3,It's like those poker-playing dog pictures,"The book dissappointed me so I came here to see what others thought. Some folks made the good point that a popular or first book could be a lot worse, and I can agree with that - it was good enough to finish, with some flipped pages (like the dog opera libretto - arf).And I agree with some others that there's a lot of woodenness and plot problems. Exactly how did the dogs acquire such urban, educated, cultivated tastes and abilities from their rural Prussian emigre villiage in Canada? Doghouse and Garden subscriptions?No matter. The monster dogs are like the poker-playing dogs of velour painting fame: abiding, interesting, anthropomorphic what-if-ish characters that probably say something deep about us. However like the accelerated lifespans of the dogs in the book - they get old quickly."
2,You can judge a book by its cover.,"Great descriptions of clothing. Sort of an interesting meditation on the cult of celebrity, but doesn't ever really take hold of one's imagination. Flat characters. Banal dialogue. Disappointing."
2,How Disappointing,"Taken in by the hype, got the book, read it, sagged with irritated disappointment. Terrific premise, title, cover art, and a natural hook for all doggie people, but, apart from an occasional sniff or switch of the ears, these aren't dogs--one wonders if the author has spent any time with any dog at all--and this isn't very good writing. Indeed, Bakis writes the absolutely worst dialogue I've read in a published work by a major house; she has her heroine, Cleo, dining with the dogs, at which time they bore themselves with inane, contrived, wooden, conversation. On at least three separate such instances, I wanted to fling Lives across the room. Almost unbearable. Skip this book. Spend your book dollars on Philip Roth's masterful American Pastoral"
3,Takes itself too seriously,"Obsurd premises. How ineffective it would be to have an army of dogs who must hobble on hind legs and use canes? If you are going to create a servant class why would you make them as smart, or smarter than you?"
2,"Arf, arf - a true dog","This was one of the most astonishing publishing errors of 1997. Not only are the characters in this book hardly differentiated from each other but it blatantly shows the author is ignorant of science, the makings of theater, true musical composition and lyric writing. It just infuriated me! The business with the opera was a scream to anyone who works as a theater professional. No one would have produced that dog of a show and no one should have published this ""wholly original"" woofer."
1,Perfectly Awful,"Grossly underdeveloped characters. Ridiculously unresearched scientific ramifications necessary to make the dog-to-near-human transformations even remotely plausible. Never fully realizes the dark, hallucinogenic mood that was apparently being sought after. A story with promise collapses upon itself almost immediately.Don't waste your money or time."
5,Pasta Pot,"Love this pasta pot. Big enough for whole ears of corn as well as pasta. The pot is not too long to fit on one burner, the handles are comfortable to hold, lit fits nicely."
5,Rachael Ray Oval Pasta Pot,I really love this pot. I am so glad I bought it. It is very good quality.
4,good pasta cooker,"It's nice to be able to put all the spaghetti in at once. Dumping the cooked spaghetti is a bit tricky, as the mouth of the pan is wide, perhaps wider than your colander. In my case, it's fine, and no spaghetti is lost when draining."
4,Susan from Naples FL,"This is a great Pasta & sauce pot as well as a stew pot. I love it. A friend recommended it, and I am so glade I bought one."
4,Convenient,"I was motivated to purchase this pot because of the oval shape and convenience for cooking long pasta. I have an oval burner on my stove so size of pot was good fit. I believe the water takes longer to boil due to open spout on cover. Can not always view the cooking process due to condensation building up on cover. I thought that the open spout would be convenient for draining liquid but I think that I will still end up taking the cover off for most draining purposes. All in all not a bad pot. Not too heavy which is a plus for me. Do like the shape. I think it will work well for cooking corn on the cob which I unfortunately, being a New Englander will have to long wait for! Corn will not be ready until August!! :("
5,Excellant,I love my pot. Unable to find it anywhere else for the price. Love to cook in it. Pasta turns out perfect.
4,8 qt anodized past pot,I purchased this pot for roasting meat and vegetables. Only drawback was the orange handle. I had to lower the oven rack for it to fit in oven.
1,Stinks REALLY,I got the whole racheal ray pan set and added on the oval pans. Every time and every pan I wash them they all smells like DIRTY FEET (like my husbankds work boots I am sure a lot of us has smelt these when your husband comes home)Well all I can say is it is nasty nasty nasty.I have contacted racheal ray also and have not received a reply back. I would not tell anyone to get these pans untill they fix this MAJOR problem.Also the cooking is very very uneven in these oval pans.I dont rate the pans well at all.
4,My Daughters Birthday Gift,"My daughter did like the Pasta Pot, however, she thought for the money it should have been more versatile, ie. able to bake with it in the oven. She has a family of 5. Would she purchase it again probably not! Purchased at Amazon."
4,4.5 stars - I use for way more than pasta!,"I've had this pot for several months and I love it. And I rarely cook spaghetti! The oval shape makes it possible to position the pot so I can have two large pots fit on the back of the stove. Very helpful when I'm cooking several things and don't want the kids to be able to reach the hot pans.I use this pot when I am making soup and chili that cook on low for hours at a time. Cleans up nicely - Even forgotten chili has wiped out easily!Before ordering this we picked up the orange enamel version from Target. That pot seemed poorly made. The enamel was chipping off the rim of every pot on the shelf. I was a little nervous about ordering this one but I'm really glad I did. I use it often and it looks brand new.Like some other reviewers have said, the lid does fog up (my other RR pots do, too)."
4,great pan,excellent pot for pasta. Heats up fast has even cooking. I would recommend this. I like all of the pots and pans in this line. Love the orange color also
5,Franklin Plants a Tree,"As a paraprofessional in a public school system, I would highly recommend this book for any young child. This story represents an excellent teaching example to children about the importance of responsibility and their role in accepting responsibility. It also demonstrates how children can benefit from each other's friendship. With spring almost here, I feel every child would benefit having this book. These Franklin books, published by Scholastic, in my opinion, are an excellent educational resource for all young children."
3,Too little focus on science,"The book is enjoyable but the descriptions of Neumann's contributions to science are too brief.In the beginning chapter there is almost full page explaining the origin of the surnames of John's parents, or the meaning of the word "" Gymnasium "" in different countries and I would have liked to have a similar level of detail about John's work and breakthroughs.Despite being light on equations, the book is still interesting and accessible.3,5 stars."
4,"Fantastic translation, but meek reading","Mitchell's translation takes on the complexities of Rilke and somehow manages to render them elegantly, effectively and without sacrificing clarity. But his reading! He sounds like a Disney mouse trebling and whimpering through his own fantastic translation, which is a disappointment, given how powerful it is. Still, this is a great asset; I recommend highly. It is amazing to listen to the words as spoke from as close to the poet as one can reach, and once you get past the weak performance, the poetry is ringing."
2,Disappointing,"The horse doesn't stay hooked on to the carriage too well. It always comes apart. It's a pain. It's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing. It's cute to look at, but my daughter lost interest in it quickly."
4,Great Toy full of hours of entertainment,I got this toy for may daughter's 3rd birthday! I have to say that it has provided hours of fun and she loved to brush the hourses mane. The dolls that go in the carriage fit nicely and is very durable as she like to beat on it a little. I would recommend this for people with little girls who love to play princess anytime.
2,Rises to the level of the authors interviewed,"If you are looking for insights on writing or even on the impact of the giants on modern mystery writers, don't buy this book. Unless you want to know how Sara gardens or how brilliant Jonathan's children are, or how forgetful Tony is, there's not much to be had here.Maybe my expectations were wrong. I've been re-reading the masters of American noir: Hammett and Chandler to name two. I expected the authors to be more aware of that tradition, and for Kaminsky to spend more time exploring the authors' place in the mystery genre. My mistake."
2,amateur hour,"Considering its potential, this book is almost a total dud. Kaminsky would be right at home in one of those magazines where they grill stars on their favorite color. And while some of the photos are intriguing, many of them are out of focus or poorly-framed."
4,A Last Visit with Tom,"If you enjoyed Tom through the years as I did, you will certainly enjoy this video. A last visit with an old friend, and his favorite pastime."
3,NICE ALBUM SHORT ON SONGS ONLY 9 ARE INCLUDED.,"THIS CONCERT COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD.BUT WITH ONLY 9 SONGS,IT IS A RIPOFF.ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE CONCERT IS INCLUDED.WHY?.. THE SONG SELECTION IS GOOD.WOULD HAVE COULD HAVE MIGHT HAVE,IF NOT SO SHORT ON SONGS.AS LONG AS CUSTOMERS PURCHASE ALBUMS,WITH AS LITTLE AS FIVE TO TWELVE SONGS,THE RECORD PRODUCERS WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS.THIS WAY YOU BUY PART ONE TWO OR THREE,PAY 3 TIMES AS MUCH FOR MATERIAL THAT COULD BE RELEASED ON ONE ALBUM.A BUY OR HOLD IS UP TO YOU ."
4,Beauty on a Backstreet,"Yes, this is a repackaging of the shows from Germany, but what a treasure!Especially exciting for me was the band. Eddie Zane (drummer) worked with Foghat. Stephen Dees (bass) was a protege of Daryl's for awhile--Daryl produced an album for him. But, for me the treat here is Todd Sharp on guitar. This guitar genius was all of 19 or so at the time of these shows. He went on to play for Bob Welch and Christine McVie (both formerly of Fleetwood Mac), Rod Stewart and then Delbert McClinton. He also worked with Mick Fleetwood.The whole period feel to the shows is great, but just watching the interaction of the band is awesome, particularly on ""Johnny Gore"". I saw this band many times and to see this show brings back lots of fun memories."
3,Good Show. Needs More Music!,"Nice performance from Daryl and John in their shows where they still played some ""Abandoned Luncheonette"" (Yes there are more songs than ""She's Gone"")and the ""War Babies"" albums.There are different packages of this DVD out, so check the song list before buying. You might end up getting duplicates."
3,Not everything included was shipped,"A real disappointment. The carrying pouch and the organizer/memory keeper were not included. I went with the gift boxed camera because this was all-inclusive. The camera is a great buy, but lets not advertise a camera ""bundle"" unless one can deliver. This consumer didn't receive what was decribed."
4,The best insight on the world of Highlander,"I have had a chance to read this book. I have enjoyed it tremendously. It is a good insight on the world of Highlander. The pictures are great. The chronology of the episodes let you follow the story as you watch the shows. The characters are well explain. The interviews with the actors of the show are well done and presented, they let you know the person behind the character. All in all I have enjoyed a lot the book and would recommend it to somebody else.Enjoy!"
3,Excellent in delving into the mystery of behind-the-scenes,"Though the behind-the-scenes reporting is in-depth and *extremely* informative in respect to special effects, costuming, sword- and fight-choreography, the discussions with the actors and the powers that be (particularly the latter) seem to focus on the last season, and the defense of an episode arc which a number of fans considered to be a violation of the spirit of the show.Also, key actors from the earlier seasons *were* missing, most notably Alexandra Vandernoot (Tessa Noel) and Philip Akin (Charlie DeSalvo), both of whom played important roles. I would hope to see in the future a *more* complete guide than this one."
4,READ THE EPISODE SUMMARIES FIRST!,This book gives incredible insights as to how the series is filmed - but it would be worthwhile to read the episode summaries first to know what the behind-the-scenes people are referring to!
2,Sad Summer....,"Well, what can I say. We know that Donna Summer is the 'Greatest Hits' diva on cd's in the last decade. This dvd is a poor try to achieve the same with her videoclip career. Only five (yes, it's a complete dvd single) clips are collected here and nothing more. It's a must have for Donna fans because there is nothing more to find on dvd than the 'Live And More Encore!' concert. That's the only reason. I know fans like me are waiting for a complete videoclip collection on dvd like 'Endless Summer' with the clips we're still missing everywhere like 'The Woman In Me' etc. Of course with clips 'Melody Of Love' and 'I Will Go With You' included. That would be the perfect collection! This is only a give-away, nothing special. Further it still sad not to have any visual stuff from Donna's supreme disco days. She did quite some wonderful performances and tv shows so there must be something left in the vaults to make a dvd which would do Donna Summer justice. This is a sad summer indeed..."
1,Warning!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!I bought it expecting about 20 of Summers Best. What I got was 5 TV-Videos of which only 1 qualified - ""This time I know its for real"".I can understand the situation of ""The Industry"", but in this case, they ask for it. Paying 26$ handling and toll....This is a rip off - no more no less!Buy something else and be sure to check the titles - I didnt!Hans Christensen"
2,Average&doesn't do her Justice,"Donna Summer's is one of the Best Vocalist ever to me&also very Prolific. sad thing is this Compilation doesn't highlight Her He day 70's run.""She works hard for the Money"" is the best&Only clip here that stands out.the other ones just don't cut it years later.hopefully one day She will get a better Career DVD/Video Retrospective."
2,Donna Summer,Very dissapointed...nothing but her OLD songs n when put the DVD in to play got a cup of cof n got back its about over....too much of the old stuff for sure..would not purchase this item again....
2,Incomplete cash in compilation,"Donna Summer is a musical legend who has transcended trends and whose career has outlasted many of her contempories. This is a short dvd compilation of some of her 'arguably' better videos from the 80's, but its so sad that an artist of her stature has yet to receive the full dvd career retrospective treatment encompassing her groundbreaking 70's work (yes there are clips availble) ALL her 80's and 90's music videos and more. In 1994 a vhs collection of videos (also incomplete) entitled Endless Summer was released and at least it was a half hearted attempt to capture some of her video work on one collection. This is only for the non fans who want a cheap collection of 5 videos."
3,"cute love story, badly written ""hip"" language","at the persistent request of my friend, i dutifully followed her orders and read Eyeliner of the Gods. It was a quick, funny, and interesting read. The only thing that really annoyed me and made reading the book a torture was Maxwell's constant use of vernacular, idiomatic, ""hip"" language. ""Pooh, dawg, etc"" were just not my taste. It was a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to sound like a teenager, but otherwise the book was decently written.if all you want is a summary, then here it is. January James is a teenage girl (who's full of either overused cliched phrases or never heard before idioms) who goes to Egypt on a school field trip. She's faced with troubles as she's forced to be with a snobby girl named Chloe and a strict chaperone. Though, luckily she meets a boy named Seth, but then finds out everybody thinks he's the reincarnated Eygptian god Set. What will happen next? dun, dun, dun."
5,Real World GoLive clarifies this overwhelming program,"After buying and struggling with Microsoft FrontPage on and offfor months, I finally gave up and (at a graphic designer's suggestion)bought GoLive and this book. With no web experience at all, using only the Real World GoLive 4 book, in one month I had a (now award winning) site built with hundreds of pages and thousands of images........GoLive is confusing and intimidating at first, but sitting down and reading this book made the logic, power and speed of this program easy. I recommend both highly. William Moree. moree@moreephoto.com. Boston, MA. END"
5,Bravo Jeff & Glenn,"This book has quickly become indispensible. I've been building sites with GoLive for several years, and like every really deep program (Photoshop for example) GoLive is full of hidden features, mysteries, and more than the occasional frustration. Real World GoLive 4.0 has answered questions that have plagued me from day one. It is an easy to use reference work, not simply thorough but clear.These guys write well about a difficult subject. Their humor helps, but their well distilled and well organized knowledge helps even more. Bravo!"
3,JUST OK,"It's a thousand-fold improvement on both the GoLive manual and online help. But it has many lapses of its own. Although the authors have tried to clarify some of GoLive's user-unfriendly procedures, in some cases they muddle things up more. They even had to clarify some of their own explanations on their Web site.Speaking of which: the Web site promises much but delivers little. And forget about ongoing support: the site now supports only their latest book, REAL WORLD ADOBE GOLIVE 5.My advice is to buy whichever book covers your version of GoLive, but expect to cross-reference everything with GoLive's own online help files...."
2,Manual not Instruction book,"I give this book one star for thouroughness and one star for good writing. However it needs more more graphics (deduct 1 star), more digestable chapters (- 1), and a complete step-by-step project that encompases the use of the most commonly used tools (- 1).This book is too overwhelming and assumes the user understands and has used all the tools or has experience creating web sites.I have designed several sites but I have never built them. I am looking for another book that will help me get to a working point where I can then expand my knowledge. I will consult this book only when I am well versed in the basics of GoLive."
5,Great Book,"Of all the books I've seen on Adobe GoLive so far this one is the best. It is very well written. It is thorough and goes to what I think are considerable lengths (they cover regular expressions - that's cool), so it should serve as a great beginners tutorial to get people like me up and running quickly and it is a great reference as well. It is easy to understand. A great smattering of humor is used throughout (at least one of the authors I think may be a Peter Sellers fan).One bonus is the authors are very active and approachable in the forums and mailing lists dealing with Adobe GoLive and they have a web site devoted to the book and the program with updates, news, helpful hints and tons of resources."
5,Refreshing thought on young adulthood,"I loved the book and thought it was so well written. It gave an inside view into children's thinking that was so true. I am 75 years of age but it made me remember what it was like to be a child. Anyone, especially of the female persuasion, will enjoy this book."
1,Kawasaki jetski,"Do not buy this game. If you have windows 2000 or windows NT this game will not work on it. It will only work on windows 95 or 98. I learned this the hard way. So to put it bluntly I will never by another Encore game, do to the fact that they don't tell you this huge detail and you would think a game would be made to work on future systems, since computers change and upgrade so quickly."
2,Life In Prison,"The memoirs of a young man who was found guilty of robbing a liquor store and was sentenced to 20 years in prison while his partner-in-crime was given probation. For such a book, it is not all that intense or gritty, but does give a good impression of prison life at the time that the books was written in. The impression one gets, although probably misleading, is that of a decent guy who was treated rather harshly by the legal system. Not really impressive, but worth an afternoon maybe."
2,"OK, nothing special","This video is OK as exercise instruction goes. As softcore erotica, it's a bit lacking. The image quality is poor, very grainy. And there was only one guy who excited me. The video is divided into sections based on muscle groups (abs, triceps, chest, shoulders) but each section features only one model. Since I wasn't enthused about most of the men, it was a grind to watch each very long section (except the shoulder portion).The lower body video is better in my opinion. Better looking models, and all models are featured in each section. And the picture quality is better."
5,THE MAGICAL WORLD OF AQUA,"If you are looking for something fun and amusing to read about, check out this book. It has many colorful surprises like a pull-out poster to put on your wall. If you like Aqua, this is the book for you."
4,Poor reprinting of an excellent resource,"I agree with the previous reviewer - Smith & Hall is an excellent resource, but Wimbledon's reprint of it has some embarrassing mistakes. Not only are several pages (54, 57, 59, 182, 202, 419, 825) missing and replaced with copies of other pages, and pages 774 and 775 are reversed, but the cover was bound upside down on my edition. However, the cover is a minor error, and the missing pages can be viewed at http://www.grexlat.com/biblio/smith/index.htm, so it's not a total loss. I'm only deducting one star for the printing problems."
2,limited substance,"Most of the ads seem a bit ""huckster-ish"". Although, some words and phrases are refreshing and inspirational"
2,Missing CD,Havent read much yet but the cd that was supposed to be there was not. I would've liked to use it. That's one of the reasons I purchased this book.
3,"Repeat, repeat, repeat.","Clifford the big red dog has become a big franchise. The repetitiveness of the series soon becomes boring to adults. Basic plot: Clifford gets in trouble, but he's such a good dog, it always works out in the end. BUT, the kids in my library like them. They check them out over and over and the lessons that are taught and the good fun makes them good, but not great books."
3,Average recommendation,This is an OK book for people looking for ideas but there were not many very creative ideas. I would rate its usefulness as average.
5,excellent package,the book was packaged very well & met my expectations. it was in excellent condition. very satisfaied with my prder.
5,Great to share with kids!,This book was great! I shared the stories with some of my students. It is so nice to hear the nice things people do.
3,Maybe I'm being nit-picky...,"There were quite a few issues with this book for me. There were grammatical and punctuation errors and even mistakes on who's who! In one scene, Danny and Flack are interchanged, causing serious confusion for those less familiar with the characters. The storyline isn't bad, but the errors make it a difficult read."
1,BORING,I couldn't get past the first 20 pages! It does not capture the characters and the writing is not very sophisticated.
2,most boring of all the CSI books...so far,*Dead of Winter* was the most boring CSI book for me...so far. I have enjoyed reading the other books (CSI and CSI:Miami). This is the first that I've read of CSI:NY and just did not enjoy it at all. Maybe it was just the topics involved: an author suspected of killing a fellow tenant and a witness in protective custody killed.
3,LFO,This is a fairly good book for LFO fans. The pictures are beautiful but some of the facts about band members are incorrect. LFO fans will enjoy it though. And the book is tiny so you can carry it with you at all times!
1,Another Boot Legged poor qualityThis,BOOT Legged:This is not an official licensed Hopalong Cassidy DVD release. The official and highest of quality Hoppy DVD's call 800-711-4677.
1,Ouch,"I can't believe anyone would give this a decent review. It's awful. All Music Guide calls it ""confused and unsuccessful,"" TheatreMania Guide to Musical Theatre Recordings dubs this ""Not Recommended"" and says ""this recording is an out-and-out failure,"" and Musicals101 chimes in with ""painfully miscast"" and adds ""pretentious trash."" They're right. Hard to believe that this was the only CD of South Pacific available at one time.At this point you can pick this ""gem"" up for less than $3!"
5,great every day use,I love the shampure scent. this is a really nice conditioner that I have used often over the years.I really enjoy it!recommend!
3,"Ordered conditioner, got shampoo...","I can completely understand the obsession with the Shampure products. The scent is high end and intoxicating. Although I'd ordered the CONDITIONER, I actually received the SHAMPOO. I'm laid back about things like this. Since I'd never used an Aveda product, I decided to go ahead and give it a try. Shampoo is very clean--and low-sudsing. It rinses really well without residue or buildup. I love the scent so much, I've used a dollop here and there as a body wash. It works great and the smell is divine. I'm going to order again--but from a different supplier. Just because you get a lower price, doesn't always mean you're getting what you ordered. However--I'll be a regular Aveda user now. Its definitely a FIVE STAR PRODUCT, but i gave it three due to the mishap. Hopefully next time I'll actually get the conditioner, LOL!"
1,My hair really got damaged by this product,"This is not really good product. I would recommend people to buy Shiseido product.This product let me feel it is full of chemical stuff and destroy my hair. I used it for a semester, and my hair became worse and worse."
1,"Fast Food Epictetus. Sorry, it does not work!","I had mixed emotions while reading this book. As far as the content is concerned, I found Epictetus (or at least what is left of him) what I was hoping for, especially after reading ""Letters from a Stoic"" by Seneca. But unfortunately something did not click with this book. I have to admit that the so called ""New Interpretation"" by the author has left an overall sense of confusion in me. I personally did not enjoy the translation, interpretation and presentation of the content. While reading this book I almost felt like eating at a fast food of philosophy where great content is thrown down your throat in small bites, just to appeal to a wider audience, maybe in a rush!?!I do not believe this book is worth recommending to anyone. I personally would have preferred to have her comments/interpretations during or after the original content to help readers get closer to Epictetus' words."
2,A Loose Translation of Epictetus,"This is a very loose translation of Epictetus. The use of phrases such as ""strike it rich"" do not so much give a contemporary feel as jar the reader. The writing itself is graceless and leaves the impression of a light weight attempt to to meet a feel-good agenda rather than an honest translation. If this was Epictetus's legacy he would have been forgotten 2000 years ago."
3,Short and sweet wisom. Almost too short and sweet.,This book was recommemed by a specialist in treating people with attendtion deficit disorder (ADD). The pieces of wisdom are good bits of wisdom but I feel it would have been better if the author could have elaborated. The pieces of wisdom are only one two pages. Some only a paragraph or two. Perhaps given examples or some type of historical context as Robert Greene id in 48 principles of power.
1,Stoics: The people who don't care...,I read some part of the book in the university library. It is really interesting one. It can serve as a manual for people who do not care about life and what is going on but the reality is absolutely different...I don't advice you spending money on this book...
5,pleased with purchase,Having already owning a copy of this book I recently purchased another one because the original was lost. I enjoy reading the philosophy of Epictetis.
5,Great Book,"Wonderful book with ageless wisdom. With all the current blather, it is great to find a book with timeless thoughts."
3,Condition Great - Delivery Slow,The condition of both books were great. Delivery of the books from two different sources was longer then expected. Just glad to get 'em.
1,Not a worthwhile purchase...look elsewhere,"The words of Epictetus are sound advice and valuable to any seeker of knowledge. However, Sharon Lebell manages to make his words sound like fridge magnet philosophies more than reasoned tracts. In the brevity and condensation much is lost. Of the 113 pages (not 144 as stated) many are only third of a page (or less) 'soundbites'. It is more of a pamphlet than a book and not worth the cover price. Lebell adds nothing to the words of Epictetus and manages somehow to make his philosophies less potent. Fortunately, if she is truly a student of Stoic philosophy, my review shouldn't bother her in the least. For a fantastic look at the Stoic philosophy and it's modern application I suggestA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy."
2,Historical Document or Self Help?,"I bought this book for a Roman History class, thinking I was buying a primary source document, in a translation true to Epictetus's writing. However, I quickly realized that this wasn't so. In a side by side comparison with a translation by W.J.Oates, Professor of Classics at Princeton U. in 1957, there are numerous additional passages, and some very different meanings, with several words of wisdom that are not to be found in Professor Oates translation. Whether these were found later, I can't testify to, but this translation would make a fine, politically correct, self help book, but as a piece of historical writing, it doesn't pass the historian's litmus test."
3,Under Epictetus adumbration the author produces a manual,"Its concise, practical, pertinent, a book that contains ideas of Epictetus that the author has put foward to us. But Epictetus is ""persona muta"". Which of the ideas are entirely his? Which are Lebell's ?"
5,Good Ideas Presented,"I appreciate the review, ""Even Watered Down Epictetus Is A Treat."" This version is perhaps watered down by academic standards, even errant in its conception. I like the book immensely, however, precisely because it is geared for contemporary audiences. I like the writing style and the risks Lebell takes in interpretation. She's no fundamentalist. The words are alive for our time, not for the sake of preserving academic sawdust."
4,Does what ya need it to,"These fit DVD's perfectly and at a good price, only nit is that all of mine were wrinkled which made them less appealing for resale, but still a good deal and the average consumer probably won't notice the wrinkles"
4,Great Play yard,I just bought this play yard and I love it the bassinet feature is a life saver since I am brestfeeding and my 3 month old daughter sleeps in our room. The baby loves the vibrating and the music too.All in alll this is a great investment. I am lookong forward to seeing how well it travels.
3,Not at all like the picture!!!!!!,"I just recieved my Eddie Bauer pack-n-play and this was not it! This is happenening with the Eddie Bauer Mercer as well. I called the manufacturer and they told my that the Musical Deluxe has taken there place. I received the Musical Deluxe which is primarily gray and the changing station is positioned in the middle. Eddie Bauer no longer makes them on the side. If purchasing through Amazon or Babies R US via web you will also recieve the grey Musical Deluxe. It seems to be of good quality and I'm debating to keep it or exchange it all together but, I want everyone to be aware."
2,baby gift ruined,"i think it was nice but it came in a box that was already opened taped back up with an entire roll of tape. then come to find out, the thing was broken, probably returned from another person. my friend had to return it to a store and they didnt even have it anymore... so, why did i have to pay for shipping?? i cant really rate this as a product because i wouldnt know, but the service (especially for a baby shower gift!) was sub-par."
1,Low Quality product,"I was looking for a product that would protect my daughter's Razr as well as give it a little sparkle. This product was really thin and flimsy, of low quality, and unattractive. My suggestions is to pass on this one."
3,never read it. skimmed it but it was not what i thought it was going to be.,I heard this woman speak at UCLA ~ LA Times Book fair and boughta used copy but was disappointed. It didn't live up in my mind to whatshe had said it was and what i could get out of it. Just my two cents.
5,A couldn't-put-it-down book of criticism!,"I guess it is well known that Smiley is a witty, intelligent, and congenial writer but this book nevertheless surprised me. I didn't want it to end! I found myself hoarding the pages of the penultimate essay the same way I do with the closing chapters of a novel I am enjoying. I will now have to re-read to figure out how she accomplished this (can it be simply a matter of voice?), but in the meantime want to recommend it to all comers. Just delightful."
4,The definitive book on odds-line making,"Mark Cramer, The Odds on Your Side (Cynthia Publishing, 1990)Widely regarded as the definitive book on setting an odds line in your Thoroughbred handicapping, and for good reason. Cramer, who's authored a number of excellent handicapping tomes, spends a couple of hundred pages on the concept of value and how to achieve it. His greatest strength is his simple asserion, backed up with a number of examples, that there is no mechanical formula to be used; it's different for every race. He illustrates handicapping as art, rather than the handicapping-as-science approach used by many other books. Definitely a work that belongs in the bookshelf of every horseplayer, casual or serious. **** 1/2"
5,The best chain ever,"I ride my bike all seasons in Montreal. In winter you can use whatever lube you want, the slush, salt, grim will eat through your chain in record time. This is the only chain I tried that survived more than a year on my bike (and I tried many). Now all my 1/8 bikes ride on those and I love them"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"My twin 1 year olds can't keep their hands off this book. I imagine I read it to them at least 5 times a day...and in between they 'read' it by themsleves many times. They love the bright colors and want to know what every animal is called. Their favorite page is the 'noisy' animals page, because there we get to make all sorts of fun sounds! I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting to get a good book for their baby to learn about animals and what they look like. Lots and lots of fun! And as other readers have said, it's a REALLY durable book. Our ""Goodnight Moon"" board book has long had it's cover ripped off and pages chewed to mush. But our ""My First Animals"" board book still looks practically new despite the 'mileage' the twins have put on it. My only regret is that I didn't get the entire series when I bought this one. I plan on correcting that mistake soon!"
3,Too Small,"The pictures were nice, but they were crowded onto small pages. My 11 month old loves his book on colors because the objects jump out on the pages. The way this book was arranged is boring. I'd like to see a dolphin swimming in the ocean, not cut out and pasted next to a land animal that has nothing to do with him. I think it would be slightly more interesting to an older kid who knows animals already, but overall I was disappointed."
2,"Not appropriate for a ""First"" Book","The pictures are very nice. However, there are too many on each page. Unless a child has had a lot of exposure to many different kinds of animals, it is difficult to distinguish them. I just found it too busy. It is not for young toddlers."
4,"Nice book, but labelling is kind of stupid","This is a nice, high quality board book, and the pictures are really nice and clear. The problem is that some of the labels they use and some of the pictures they use are not really appropriate for a toddler.For example:They show a picture of a maned wolf and just label it ""wolf"" - well if you're not familiar with what a maned wolf looks like - it looks like a big, tall, skinny red fox. It doesn't look at all like a typical timber wolf.On one page they show an inaccurate illustration of an alligator and on the next a crocodile. I think this is really confusing for a young toddler.They have all these obscure bird, insect and fish species that I'VE never even heard of or seen before. Why does a young toddler need to know this? They should be learning the basics! (Like why are they teaching the ""postman caterpillar""? They are from Central America and are totally obscure. My daughter will likely never see one or ever have to identify one.)"
3,Decent animal book with some obscure animals,"I thought this book was ok. It's not my daughter's favorite. She loves the ""First Words"" book, but that is also a large book and the animal book is really small (at least the one we bought). I didn't mind that some of the animals were drawings. I didn't think that feature was obvious or ruined the book by any means (as some suggest). I did however think there were quite a few obscure animals that didn't seem developmentally appropriate for my daughter's age 1. But perhaps when she is older she will be more interested in a sea slug or a bush baby ;)"
4,Simenon vs. Japrisot,"The inevitable comparison when confronting a French mystery would have to be with Simenon and his Maigret series. In which sense, Japrisot's The 10:30 from Marseille is less a master inspector's point-of-view mystery than an ensemble presentation. Victim and witness get as much attention as the protagonist detective, and we learn more about his superiors and subordinates as well. The result is a psychological potpourri as interesting as the whodunit, though Japrisot also gives the reader a more intricate puzzle to solve than anything I've come across in Simenon. If not for the too neat scramble at the end to tie up every loose end--some of which did not need tying up--I would have given this book five stars.I Think, Therefore Who Am I?"
1,This scale is a piece of garbage!,"I bought this scale to do small kitchen measurements. It is supposed to weigh things up to 4.4 pounds. No matter how much weight I put on it, I couldn't get it to register a weight over 1.5 pounds! I tried weighing something that I knew was exactly 1 pound and I got a different answer 9 out of 10 times. It looks great, but it does not work."
2,Inaccurate,"If you really need to know how much something weighs, this is not the scale for you. Every time I tap it, it shows a different number."
3,good....,"The book was referred to me by another system administrator, who used it on his large corporate network with ease. this book does provide a great starting point, covers many of the details, and can be used just by itself to setup zenworks"
5,valuable & intriguing,"My husband gave me this book when I was starting training for a new job. It has become one of my favorites. I really enjoy the photography in the book and reading the interviews. I liked reading the interviews with the woman and comparing it to her husband's interview. The categories kept the topics fresh, and the country stats helped keep a perspective and context for each family. My feeling was that women everywhere have lots more in common that we might guess, and that women do in fact make the world go round."
3,Great concept - mirror too small,The product works as advertised. It is easy to install and does not interfere in any way with the handle bar grip. However the mirror is too small and anything farther than 20 feet looks like a speck on the mirror. The mirror is attached to the mount with a ball swivel so that it can be adjusted easily. That mounting does not stand up to hot weather very well. Mine loosend up after a few days and will not stay adjusted.
1,Junk,The mirror lasted 4 days before it fell off the bike. The plastic ball-joint became loose the 1st time I used it. I tightened up the joint before each ride after that. On the 4th ride after instalattion the mirror fell off as I was riding down the road. I should have known that it was cheap for a reason.
3,ok for the money,Has been useful but make sure you tighten the screw that holds the mirror as it can come apart and get lost.
3,Tiny but pretty,"Clear Rose de France stones are way smaller than I had anticipated but very pretty. The gold setting, however, shows that these earrings are quality jewelry. A classic style for a petite woman."
2,tiny earrings,"Sadly, There was not sufficient warning that the earrings were so small. They hardly show on a person with long dark hair.The quality didn't look as nice as in the photo on line. I will not buy jewelry on line again."
3,Disappointed That Stones Do Not Have Deep Purple Color,"I have a deep purple amethyst pear shaped pendant and wanted earrings to match. I knew that another customer was not satisfied with the color, but I decided to buy them anyway. They are very nice earrings and I was happy with every aspect of the earrings except for the color of the stones. The color of the stones on the earrings that I received looked more like the picture of these earrings in white gold14k White Gold Amethyst Pear and Square Dangle Earringsthen the picture shown for this item. I am disappointed that Amazon has not updated the picture or the description of ""royal purple amethyst"" and ""rich purple amethyst"" since the product does not have these qualities. If you don't mind a lighter color amethyst, then I recommend, but if you want a deep purple color as the picture shows, you may be disappointed as I was."
2,Disappointing,Product doesn't match the picture and they are very light weight and small. They do not sparkle and lack a quality appearance. The smoky quartz color is very dull in appearance and the gold setting makes them look very ordinary. Small earrings can look so much nicer than this one.
3,Not Worth $69.99,"These earrings are lovely, but I don't feel that, considering their size and the amount of gold, they are worth the price charged. Still, I'm keeping them. (BTW, I'm not Philip, I'm his wife!)"
4,Pretty!,"The color of these is a very watery pale green and I like them a lot. You can't really tell that they are green when you are wearing them unless the light hits them just so. They are much paler than the photo, but it is a nicely matched hint of green rather than a fake looking, over-done green.These are well mounted, and all the stones have a nice cut, very sparkly, plenty of movement and easily catch the light. The earrings are not too heavy or drag down your earlobe or tip over at a weird angle on your ear. They dangle at a nice distance below your ear, not too long... very classic look.I have metal allergies and these earring did not break me out one bit when I wore them.I will be replacing the back - it seems kind of wimpy to me and I like a more secure feeling back.I would give them 5 stars if they had just a tiny touch deeper green and had a better back. But that is a personal preference and does not reflect on the quality of the product. They are a good value for this price."
2,Too small...,"...These earrings are very beautiful, but too small for an adult--they are child-size. I returned them for this reason. (Amazon: you should consider posting an actual-size photo for all jewelry.)"
2,"Small, small, small","WOW, I must have gotten different earings than everyone else! These are TINY. I was expecting the pear to be completely below the lobe and they are NOT! I don't have large ears either.Color is beautiful, construction quality is great, but I was expecting something more substantial!"
4,Not very green,"Love the earrings! They aren't very green at all. They look almost crystal, but they are beautiful. I have long hair, so they are big and bright enough to be seen with all my hair. Very pretty."
3,Not green at all,"These are very pretty earrings, but they aren't green at all. I thought I had been sent the wrong pair when I opened the box. They are also smaller than I had expected."
1,What a Dissapointment,"Although I picked them out, my husband gave these to me as a Christmas gift. They were so small they could hardly be seen in the package. They will be returned immediately."
2,"light color earrings, more grayish than green",The earrings color was not green. It was an indefinable color; really light not green or clear. The earrings size was acceptable.I returned the earrings because I couldn't match with anything.
2,Extreme color variation per earring,"I really liked the photo of these earrings online, so I made my husband happy by ordering my own birthday present. Upon receipt, I was very disappointed that one earring is a dark amethyst and the other earring is much, much lighter. I almost kept them because of the lovely style and excellent craftsmanship, but I sent them back for a refund. Now, unfortunately, my husband feels that he has to go shopping for a present for me!"
3,green amethyst earring review,"The earring are not the same color as shown, barely green tinged. Otherwise nice style and cut. Wish they were more green"
3,Pretty,"But note the description: ""Gem type"" is what the marketers want to call it. ""Material"" is what it is made of."
4,Keeping Them,"Reviews before my purchase stated ""smaller than expected"" and ""not as green as expected"" - VERY TRUE. My jeweler stated he would not price them lower than $60., but agreed they are worth more. I'm VERY CONTENT with the purchase, but not overly excited about it."
2,green amethyst,It was nice for the price; but not enough color. Darker in picture. Not sure I am keeping it.
1,Disappointing.,"Usually things that I purchase from Amazon are perfect; just what I expect; unfortunately, I had to return the amethyst earrings because they looked nothing like their picture; rather than being a bold purple color, they were very, very light colored and simply not what I expected."
1,"Pics are OK, but very politically charged","This was my first Blue Ray and 3-D movie I purchased. I shut off the audio after about 5 minutes due to the political content. Sorry I bought it. I think a lot more folks provide a better review. I just wanted to let Amazon know that I felt deceived as I love the Grand Canyon, but I do not like to be lectured."
1,Another deceiving label not matching the content.,"From the label I was sure I would be getting a 3D version of the Grand Canyon IMAX movie, which I watched several times; what I got to find out instead is the shortage of water, did not get any of the amazing shots I was expecting having seen the original Grand Canion on IMAX, and the technical quality of the 3D is not spectacular.The title and cover image were clearly intended to deceive. Check each 3D DVD you buy to make sure it doesn't have, in small print, a subtitle that says stg different from the title."
2,Inaccurate Product Description,"In the product description says that the languages ''are English, French and Spanish but actually received this DVD ONLY in English and French languages, but NOT Spanish language as indicated in the description. The 3D image is good."
3,Nice 3D demo; too much propaganda.,"I enjoyed the 3D scenery and action shots, especially rafting and kayaking the rapids. However, I was really annoyed and tired quickly of the narrated script that droned on and on about water shortages and other conservationist activism. It's a shame that demos of 3D DVDs must kowtow to this type of propaganda.Update: Although IMAX documentaries present strikingly realistic demos of the 3D video format, their commentary drones on and on pushing the conservationist political agenda; it's way, way overdone. Therefore, especially after reading other reviews of IMAX 3D products I have not yet purchased, I will not buy any more of them."
1,Annoying and bizarre,"I was really disappointed with this. There were a few scenes that had some 3D ""WOW"" factor, but the narration, editing, narrative were all amateurishly put together. I hate to insult the filmmakers, but it just didn't hold together well. It had these horribly done animations, and the narration skips between Redford and another guy, it's very weird.And, while I expected with Redford narrating it would probably be 'environmentally preachy,' I must say it really was over the top (and I'm a Sierra Club member!) -- still, I guess can't complain about that. But be warned: it's preachy. :)And boring, did I mention boring?This subject matter demands better filmmaking."
2,Terrible Story Mediocre 3D,"The 3D isn't all bad, but if you are looking for some 3D material for the sake of 3D Blu-ray this is not it. Yes there is 3D and some short shots look decent, but all in all the 3D is poor and the story is even worse. I watched half the disc and couldn't make it through... put it on eBay and got it out of here. I am an environmentalist, but the doom and gloom and preachy story about water conservation was just over the top and incredibly lame. IMAX could have at least made the visuals good, but they failed on this as well. Don't buy."
1,Robert Redford & Daughter,"If you want to watch a story about Robert Redford and his daughter in the Grand Canyon, get this DVD. If want to see the Grand Canyon, either go there or try another DVD!"
2,Disappointed.....,"Was anxious to see this DVD in 3-D and it was fair at best. I seen that Robert Redford narrated part of it and thought it would be better, especially with him tied to it. Nice scenery but expected a lot more. Probably will not watch it again."
4,Very good picture quality,"I got this disc for demo purposes. The scenic shots of the canyon are awesome. They also do some really cool shots of people rafting down the rive. Especially some first person pov on a raft which get hits with water. Really impressive in 3D. They also do some nice overlays of older photos of the canyon which they slowly reveal the current day reality of the same location. Kind of like a slow dissolve of the older photo. The director also provide some great shots from a helicopter which are amazing. Truly a great disc. My only grip, and it is small, the graphics in the opening sequence is a bit cheesy. Also when they do a PIP with people in interviews the digital frame they put around people is distracting. Otherwise definitely worth the money."
2,"Blue Ray Yes, 3D No","This is a great title, however it states it's a #D title, it contains NO 3d fottage, it's all 2D, false advertising."
1,3D Grand Canyon,"Save your money, there is not much 3d in the documentary. If you want history, then get it, but not for 3d."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This is not a beautiful look of the Grand Canyon as it is marketed. It is a overly politicized and pushy film from none other than the leftist Robert Kennedy Jr. It is full of unwarranted blame of Americans and massive propagandized misinformation wrapped in a sugary coat.
1,Realy bad 3D,"I will not spend hrs to write why you shouldn't buy this film. Just take my word, i returned the film after watching 15 minutes. This is an old converted film. relay bad quality and bad 3D. Cant be much worse."
3,Political Opportunity,"I bought this movie just to test out the new 3D TV. I like nature shows, so this was a plus. Overall the 3D effects are pretty good, but the political rhetoric gets a little old."
1,No 3D.,"If you willing to watch the 3D, don't buy this movie, there's no 3D emotion, only 2D......it's a good movie if you are intersting about the water, but there's absolutely no 3D."
1,Global Warming Propaganda,I can't believe I paid real money to see this AL Gore Global Warming propaganda......Even a tribute to the Kennedys therein...I destroyed it before I sent it to the landfill.............
2,"Great 3D, obnoxious message","The 3D effects are great but the story is distracting and a bit annoying. Ok, we get it, you believe global warming is causing the rivers to dry up. I bought this to see some 3D effects, not to listen to an environmental activist message. Save your money and buy a big name movie if you want to really enjoy watching something in 3D."
3,Not bad for $10,"After reviewing many reviews - many negative ones regarding ""preachy"" story - I wasn't sure what to expect. Yes, this movie is more about ""message"" - conserve water - than featuring 3D graphics, so if you don't like the environmental doom-and-gloom, this probably is not meant for you. If you're looking for great 3D graphics, I'm afraid it won't meet your expectations either. However, for $10 in experiencing Blu-ray 3D, I think it's not bad - you do get to experience some 3D graphics, scenery is pretty decent, and while story is preachy, the message is pretty important."
2,Just an environmental advertisement,I was looking for much more water fun and there were a few shots but for the most part this was an environmental ad.
3,ok 3d effects,I liked the scenery in this movie and the bubble 3d effects in the opening credits.. but the movie turns into a water concervation story that just goes dry . But the Grand canyon views do speak for them selves.
4,"Great 3D Presentation, but short","This is a very good, but short presentation about the Grand Canyon and some of the long range problems with the Colorado River. Photography is just great and it makes one want to take a raft ride down the Grand Canyon. I just wish the movie was longer and we would get to see more of the canyon.Other review comments by global warming deniers are just part of their attempt to put their head in the sand. This movie presents a level headed and fact-based story that needs to be seen and heard."
2,grand canyon,"Found it too be very boring,despite it being viewed in 3d.The fact that their was no action,probably would suite viewers more interested in nature.Not worth the time"
4,Beautiful Views and Great Soundtrack,"The views of the Grand Canyon are amazing. The movie is best viewed with a great sound system, turned way up. The music, by Dave Matthews Band, is a great fit to the movie."
2,Stylistically straight out of the '70s,"Stylistically straight out of the '70s. Awkward pointless interviews, twangy EZ listening score, and unintelligent environmentalist cliches. Par for the course as a boomer-porn IMAX film, and decidedly worse than early masterpieces in the format like ""Beavers."""
5,Grand Canyon in high definition,"Picture quality: Visually stunningAnother, short subject documentary, winner by MacGillivray FreemanWhite water rafting in the Colorado River accompanied by the music of the Dave Matthews Band (DTS HD Master Audio 5.1).Lots of breathtaking aerials of the Grand Canyon. Beautiful shots inside the canyon. A definite home theater reference Blu-ray disc."
2,"Decent 3D, but lame overall",It's ok. Some of the shots are quite impressive in 3d. However the movie is very short and not particularly well made.
2,DON'T BUY IT!!!,"It doesn't worth the money. For the same price you can buy anything much better than that! I was expecting much more about the 3d effects. Also, if you want to see the Grand Canyon, it's not for you! As I said, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,title and description misleading,This was a anti American environmental wacko propaganda film not about a 3d adventure. The film bashed electrical providers but I bet they are the first ones to callwhen the power goes out.
2,Bad 3D effects,"I am writing to inform everyone thinking of purchasing this DVD to be aware that there are some 3D effects that do not work properly. Most of the picture is set back too deeply that it strains the eyes to watch. Some scenes, primarily in the beginning, have bubbles that move about the screen, but as they get closer they separate into a split image that hurts the eyes allot to watch. We cannot even watch the intro because of this. The movie is great except for the depth level being too much. If you have a television that will allow you to adjust the depth level you might be alright, but the DVD options do not offer this ability to adjust. Good movie, bad 3D. Very unexpected from IMAX."
5,Awesome 3D,All I can say is WOW on the 3D effect.... okay so for a few seconds the guy in the blue shirt is blurry but otherwise the rest of the documentary was nothing short ofAWESOME!And the Music .... forget about it..... GREAT BUY IT and get you one for your 3D TV
5,Very excellent 3D quality. A fun and informative movie.,I love this movie because it is for all age levels. In 3D all kindsof activity fun to watch.
3,Good scenic adventure,"Movie has great scenes & great 3D effects but I had issues with playing this movie all the way through, kept stopping, also played on 3 other players, same thing except 1 player could not play at all, couldn't reconize file. Other than that the movie was pretty good."
2,Tree Huggers Delight,If you can get by the commentary the scenery is nice. But don't expect a lot of shots of the canyon mainly focuses on the river.
2,I'd have to say skip this one...,"There's lots of artificial 3d scenes in this blu-ray, where they take a 2d scene and computer process it into 3d. A few good genuine 3d scenes, like point of view on the rapids, but I'm repulsed by the obvious artificial 3d shots, once I notice them I can't un-notice them! And many scenes are 2d. It's also a limited film about water conservation, hopefully we will get a true 3d treatment for the Grand Canyon some day. I watched this once, where as I watch Imax Under the Sea 3d once a week. I also recommend 'The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3d' instead, it's 100 times better and cheap also."
1,Average 3D but narrative is typical brainwashed Liberal PC,"This movie has some lovely panoramic scenes in 3D. It is not in the least bit entertaining and is best watched with the audio turned off. It should have been narrated by Al Bore. You get the impression that the producers believe that all humans need to die off so the world can heal itself.Some lovely 3D photography, but narated by mindless environmental whack jobs. Dialog has little basis in current scientific fact!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
3,Excellent photography,"Breathtaking photography and music paired with video. Robert Redford and Kennedy-clan preaching the 'green' Gospel that the river is running dry,took-away two stars."
3,"Well...OK, easy to get used to","Setup: Samsung 50"" 720P 3D; 3D blueray player, Samsung glasses. FIRST 3d DVD FOR ME. 3D GLASSES OVER NORMAL GLASSES.Special 3D effects spectacular. Little bubbles, etc. Would have liked more of these.Overall more blurry than 2D version, with regular nice surprises of 3D pictures.When stopped on 3D images, spectacular.Easy to get used to, but overall more blurry than a 2D movie.Mike"
1,Political,"If your into Political Statements then this is for you, as for myself I bought this because I thought it was all about the Grand Canyon scenery. While most of the documentary did have scenery of the Grand Canyon it was the Political Commentary that turned me off."
3,BEAUTIFUL FOOTAGE! NOTHING BUT GREEN TALK!,"The footage in this blu-ray is GREAT. Some parts are extremely impressive in 3D. It's the best 3D content that I've viewed so far. However, the environmentalist message gets old before it even starts. The commentary was disappointing and an utter pain to listen to. I don't know why they couldn't have produced a film that just displays the beauty of the Grand Canyon and its surroundings without having to inject a ""beat you over the head"" environmentalist message into it. People don't spend money on a 3D setup and a 3D blu-ray to sit though the blu-ray and listen about the supposed bleakness of the Colorado River's future.The scenery makes it worth sitting through though. In fact, you could just turn on some fitting music and mute the blu-ray's audio, which would do away with the sickening commentary altogether. Overall, I recommend buying this just to view the incredible 3D footage."
1,We're all doomed !!!,"I was expecting a 3D trip down the Grand Canyon.Considering the tirle ""...River at risk"" I expected a bit of preaching, but this is non-stop. If we're not destroying all rivers, it's the rocks, if it's not that it's the ozone, if it's not that it's...... endless whining.There's more footage of the people whining about the river than there is of the canyon. Even then the speech is hard to distinguish over the background sound while the 3D effect is good in places it is mostly quite ordinary.If you want to feel like YOU are wholly and personally responsible for the entire planet buy this title, if you want to see the Grand Canyon, give it a wide bearth.Very disappointing."
2,Try with other movies,"Yo compre este documental esperando ver algo espectacular , sin embargo como fue originalmente filmada en dos dimensiones no se ve muy bien.le incorporan y sobreponen a la filmacion original unos efectos digitales en 3d pero no encajan muy bien dentro del film.No recomiendo comprar este documental si lo que quiere es verlo en 3d, si le gusta en 2d es un buen film, pero no vale la pena pagar mas por que venga en 3d."
1,Boring propaganda,"We saw this at our local Science Center Imax Theatre. We have seen many wonderful 3-D movies there. This was average 3-D footage and the content was boring and nothing but environmental preaching. I was upset that we had gone there for a fun outing and I walked out feeling like I was ""taken"". Since I don't live in the area that was filmed, I have no idea whether there is any substance to the producers' claims, but I don't like walking in to something like this without knowing it. We haven't been to another Imax film there since this experience. It was draqgy (like so many Redford films). There are so many other wonderful 3D or Blue Ray movies out there (with wonderful scenes of nature), I would certainly not recommend this one."
5,Brazilian jazz at its best!,"I first bought this album in 1983, when I was about to graduate from college, and I still have never tired of it! The songs are life-affirming and uplifting. I just can't help but feel good whenever I listen to them. I particularly like the title song, ""Come With Me,"" but I also love ""Sementes, Graines & Seeds,"" which is my favorite, and the Latin-infused ""Sangria"". Tania is immensely talented on the piano; the chords are beautiful. Her vocals are out of sight also. Tania Maria is truly in a class by herself. This is one of my all-time favorite recordings. Listening to it makes you feel good to be alive. I defy anyone to listen to it without wanting to jump up and start moving! It's that good! Tania Maria -- the girl is baaaad!"
4,Book Title = Book Contents,"Basic rook endings, rook and pawn endings (pawns on one side of the board), rook and pawn endings (pawns on both sides of the board), and double rook endings: a very focused 160 pages! Material ranges from the classic Lucena/Philidor positions, to much more complex practical rook endings. I think The Survival Guide can be profitably used both by novices for a concise introduction to rook endings and stronger players (including masters) as a comprehensive review and reinforcement. I also feel that GM Emms presents the material in an interesting, informative and well-organized manner, and maintains his emphasis on practical rook endings. Agreeing that there are other rook endings books, I still believe that you are much more likely to read, enjoy and finish The Survival Guide than most other books."
3,A worthwhile compilation,"No 60 minute compilation is going to do more than scrape the surface of a career that lasted so long and involved so many different media,but this 1991 collection of clips is well worth buying if you want to remind yourself,or discover,just how good a comedian Bob Hope,in his prime,really was.In scenes and sketches featuring such co-stars as Bing Crosby,Jack Benny,Frank Sinatra,Lucille Ball,Marilyn Maxwell,Jimmy Durante and Natalie Wood,Hope's great skill as a performer of well-written comic lines is there for all to admire.The selection of clips is stronger on the TV shows than it is on the best of the early movie years,but there are still enough glimpses of the wonderful talent - before the reliance on the cue-cards wore it down - to whet the appetite for a full-length feature."
4,OH yeah!,"Edgar and Johnny Winter seem to have put all of their best songs on this CD! If you want to hear these awesome artists and get a taste, this is the right CD to buy. I especially love tobacco road (if I remember right they both participated in that one) a 17 minute long blues session. Good variety of the many sounds of rock and roll, and Edgar takes the challenge of putting his voice in a match with a guitar. Must listen, this stuff really ROCKS! Also, keep playin' that rock n roll (Edgar Winter's White Trash) tells the story of how Edgar got his big chance while Johnny was already famous, and it shows his passion for Rock n Roll. I love the guitar lines, and best of all the blaring trumpets. And in anything else you listen to that is Edgar's songs, you will definitely get to hear a man who REALLY knows how to wail on that saxophone!"
2,"First Impressed, but Now Searching for Better","What's GOOD: Canon MultiPASS has the perfect design, is an awesome space saver, paper has never jammed, faxing is reliable, and is basically easy to use. What's BAD: Printing is very slow, copying is very slow, I spent about 3 hours on the phone with Canon Tech Support when first installed to work out some software bugs, now about six months later, for some reason when I click the print button it does not want to print. Sometimes I have to click the print button to print a basic MS Word document a dozen times before it decides to print."
3,Book okay,This book is okay. I had to read it for a university children's literature class. It is simply enough for a 3rd or 4th grader to read. I personally didn't like the book but I bought it for a dollar or two used so it wasn't that bad for the money.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"It is not too often that you would run across two women called Iseult.That, however, is what Tristan does. This is further complicated by thefact that both want him, and because of political obligations he canrealistically never have either.He does want to whack stuff with swords, as well, so none of this ends up happily."
1,not much video,you only get 5 songs worth of video and one is not even from the concert. this could have been released as a cd with additional footage. but instead you get to pay 20 dollars. overpriced...... did tull approve of this one? great cd though
3,It's just okay.,Disappointed with this book. Too much dialogue and not enough action. Russia seemed like a dreary place when this was written.
5,Who But He?,"Dostoevsky is my favorite author. This epic tale has inspired me. It has casts aside doubts that have labored my soul, and my faith. The author can capture the essence of a person's soul like no one I've heard, seen, or read. If everyone read, and took heart in his messages, how grand it would be."
5,Don't do it to yourself,"This is without question one of the greatest novels ever written. Do not atempt to argue against this book. Some critics paint Dostoevsky in braod strokes i.e he is too ""over the top"" and only has momentary flashes of brilliance. This is the kind of drivvel that gives fools internet rage. Thats when you have to jump out the cuts and lay that crikkety-clack-smack down on fools. READ THIS BOOK FOR YOUR OWN EDUCATION. I would recomend more Dostoevsky to anyone. One might also want to check out Pushkin, and Dumas."
5,A little known fact,"Like Melville, Dostoyevski is one of the few novelists that have held up for me as I have moved into my mature years. Partly it's because of the mature themes that he himself treats: the battle between good and evil in the human heart, the meaning of life, the problem of being a thinking individual in an unthinking society, and also because Dostoyevski is just a great storyteller. Dostoyevski is a writer of universal themes that continue to resonate today.By the way, neuroscientists now suspect now that Dostoyevski had a type of temporal lobe epilepsy--the pleasant kind that results in ecstatic visions--not other unpleasant sorts such as the type that produces uncontrollable rage. This might explain some of Dostoyevski's writings, and the implications of this are still being researched. It will be especially interesting to see what scholars come up with in regard to his most famous work, The Brothers Karamazov."
5,the best translation,"I'm not going to comment on the novel itself - I don't think anyone just casually stumbles on a book so famous, you already know something about what you're getting into. But I have to say this translation is the best I've read. I started with the Signet edition and switched to this one about 1/3 of the way through, and the improvement was obvious. A friend was reading the Oxford edition at the same time as me, and I preferred this one to the Oxford too. I found this translation to be very lively, with natural and believable storytelling. It also had a lot of little sylistic oddities that the Signet translation didn't - I assume they tried to ""polish"" Dostoevsky's writing style at the expense of his interesting voice. So if you want to read Karamazov but don't know what version to buy, get this one."
3,Make sure to check different translations,"I read all the hype about Pevear's translation and decided to see for myself, reading large sections of the book and comparing sentence for sentence. Honestly, I liked the old Garnett translation better. The Pevear gets the style and tone a lot better, reads smoother, but on sections with deep emotional or religious signifigance seemed to miss the point, choosing phrasings and word substitutions that are confusing and hard to relate to. The style you can always reconstruct, but to read this book and not get a clear picture of the deep spiritual despair of some of the characters would be too bad."
2,"read for philosophy, not dostoevsky's best story-telling","some profound philosophical scenes here, especially for those obsessed with anti-christianity and anti-totalitarianism. dostoevsky pours his thinking into his last work. all the elements from his previous works are there, but alas! he goes too far...the characters come off stiff, or in some cases unbelievable. sermon after sermon, especially as the all-too-obvious ending approaches. it doesn't have the suspense of crime and punishment. it doesn't have the satire of demons. dostoevsky wrote it during the most comfortable period of his life. his self-assurance led him to proselytize, rather than entertain. this one's for academics and hard-core fans. hard to beat this translation, by the way--constance garnett's sucks."
3,An Effort to Read,"Because so many people I admire say that The Brothers is the best book they ever read, I was determined to read it. I only read a few classics each year and I am not real familiar with Russian Lit. I tried this book six times and quit reading it each time. When I read somewhere that Marilyn Monroe said it was her favorite book, I determined I had to read it. I stuck to it on the seventh try. I wondered how Alosha could just be so good. He never seemed tempted. I was mystified by the anger in this family. After about two-thirds of the book, the fog lifted. I became engrossed in it. I was glad that I stuck it out. Would I read it again? No. I like books that make me work, but this was too much."
5,"The best novel written, EVER!","Besides the Holy Bible, no other book has influenced my life more than The Brothers Karamazov."
3,overrated,"Moderately overrated. Screams of pseudo-philosophy, and it is questionable whether it is worth the amount of time it takes to read it. If you liked Crime and Punishment (or didn't), it will have little bearing on whether you like this book, as the two books have rather different flavors. You might enjoy Brothers Karamazov if you're are a philosophical type, or if you read it in a context in which you can discuss the novel's competing ideologies with others. It's too heavy for ""beach reading,"" and lacks the two dimensionality of other ""great"" literature, which can be enjoyed on a simple plane, for the story itself, and on a deeper level. For a more satisfying experience with Russian literature, try Tolstoy."
3,Cut to the chase..,"1. Ivan is the only character who is worth reading. The rest of them are either completely insane, or squishy nothings (Alyosha).2. Aside from a handful of GREAT chapters, there is soooooo much nonsense filler. It's not a perfect work of art a la Tolstoy.3. Read Garnett. Don't be sucked into the Pevear/Volokhonsky marketing machine."
3,Maybe I read a bad edition...,I expected more from this book after seeing and hearing so much praise about it. It seemed more like a soap opera than one of the greatest 19th century novels. Seeing other people say there is a huge difference between translated versions I only hope that the people who put 4 and 5 stars read one that was way better translated than my version. I read one from the 1950's and was translated by Princess Alexandra Kropotkin.
1,Doomed to Failure,"Weak and confused narrative extinguishes the vital assortment of characters that are marginally 'Russian' in this excessive work. I would suggest reading ""Crime and Punishment"" for a more magnificent creating of writing."
2,severely abridged edition,"I wish it had been made clear upfront that this is a severely abridged edition of this novel. In other words, most of the words are not here. Not what I expected or wanted."
3,too much filler.,"okay, i realize that many very smart people consider this to be the best novel ever written, and i once (at the impressionable age of 24) also thought it a great book, but here's my beef: the 2nd half is almost entirely redundant. mr. dostoevsky was serializing this, & to milk it for all the money he could, he simply uses the cheap device of repeating the 1st half of the novel throughout the 2nd half. tedious courtroom testimony goes on and on. instead of hundreds of pages of courtroom testimony (which like i said simply repeats what happened in the 1st half of the book), a decently edited book would have covered the trial in 30 pages, tops. to me, a great book does not have padding. this book has reams of it. I recently reread this after some 21 years, and found that my young starry-eyed hero worship of Dostoevsky did not hold up with time. What i had thought of as one of my favorite books was a great disappointment upon a 2nd reading. too long, too unedited."
1,translators blow!,"Of course I'm not rating Dostoevsky. Who am I to rate Dostoevsky? He's a genius, we'll leave it at that.On to the translators who, as you may have gotten from the title, I abhor. Their work refutes the maxim ""two heads are better than one."" No... no, I'm not necessarily correct in that claim; they may actually be better working together, but even their combined strength is worth far less than most other individual translations I've seen.I recomend the Constance Garnett translation."
5,Brothers Karamazov,"I think this is one of the greatest novels ever written. I always heard great things about it through college, then when I finally read it, I was not disapointed whatsoever. This is just my second time through, but I remember it all as if I had only read it yesterday. The characters leave a deep impression, and the meaning and narrative of the story grip you from page one."
4,A very serious read,"This is a book I always intended to read and finally had time to do it justice during an 8 week trip to China. Its a harrowing tale and Dostoyevsky puts the reader right in among the twisted, ignorant and uneducated souls of this Russian nineteenth century nightmare of greed, lust and jealousy."
4,Good as new,"As vehicles get newer the more plastic is used, so having access to thes replacement parts is great. This fit perfectly and have no issues with it."
4,Huge fan or not?,"This was a great fight, but it really depends if you are a fight science fan or not. All of the undercards are entertaining so if you are a fan of UFC, do not hesitate!"
1,Sucked,I got disc 2 that's it so I never got to see the main card it was a complete and udder ripe off and I can't get my money back it sucks
2,Blasé,"I was not surprised to see Oprah's name on the cover of this book as it has all the Oprah ingredients: absentee fathers, poverty, alcoholism, sweet kids with bitter bruises, trite presentation of religion. Not a bad book, not a good book either."
2,"Heavy-handed symbols, mediocre plot but lovely narration","The narrator of this book is a charming young girl. She has a distinctive ""voice"" that made me very aware that this book was set in the South. In spite of this, I thought the book was fairly mediocre.The whole ""wings, flying"" symbolism/theme, etc is pretty over the top. I like that the mother named both her daughters after birds so they could fly above it all, but mentions of wings, flying, angels, etc are laid out VERY heavily. It seemed very glaring...at least one a page or so. It was so frequent and jarring that it distracted me from the narration.This book features a terribly abusive, messed up situation. Made it sort of tough to read at times. That being said, I was glad for the happy ending, and the novel did have some beautiful descriptions."
2,Ellen Foster Beats Bird's Butt,"Did anyone else find it hard to believe that after 240 pages of Mama being mean-as-hell and bad-to-the-bone that *one conversation* with Miss Zora (a woman Glory Marie hated and distrusted) suddenly turns her into a repentful, teary Mommy? Another thing got on my nerves: The overblown bird imagery that runs rampant throughout the book (two particularly painful examples: blackbird stealing her voice?--come on! and the final words of the novel : ""They flew."" Ugh!!!!)"
2,O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D,"no, the book did not SUCK. but it was terribly derivative, employing the images and steretypes we've all encountered a million times before: dysfunctional families, abused children, spineless women who collapse without their men, unhealthy love affairs, the south.... and what novel about the paradox of bleakness and hope (violin music swells), forgiveness and redemption, would be complete without that random wise old black woman who comes along and saves the day? i'm surprised oprah did the movie (which i, thankfully, passed on) -- if her role was at all faithful to the book, she was nothing more than an insulting stereotype writ large and reiterated for the nth time. and that whole blackbird snatching the voice away thing? possibly the most ham-handed metaphor i've ever read in a published piece of writing. i'm glad i borrowed the book from the library, and didn't buy it. overall, a pulpy, marginally entertaining read with a deceptively classy art-house cover."
3,...took a while to take off,Emotions. Emotions. Emotions.The author jam-packed this book with emotion -- and little storyline.
2,Before Women Had Wings by Connie May Fowler,"Fowler, Connie May. ""Before Women Had Wings"". This story in the beginning was interesting because Bird has parents that constantly fight and cuss at each other and at their children as if it were a normal thing that all families do. Bird's parents come from different cultures. Her mom is Christian but on the other hand her dad is a Baptist. So Bird wants to be a Christian but her mom tells her that she has to be like her dad and Pheobe, Bird's sister has to be like her mom, a Christian. I'd recommend this to people who has this problem in their household and not recommend this to people who don't because it's just something people wouldn't want to think about.ZAHRA @ DHS"
4,A novel full of pain,"Other reviewers do a good job of summing up what the book is about, so I won't try to do that. But I will point out that it is almost unremittingly harsh and violent. The book and the main character do, as the title suggest, soar beyond that, but this material can be hard to read. For those for whom this hits too close to home, every insult and slap will sting. For those who don't already have this kind of violence in their lives, you may not wish to bring it in. It's definitely something to consider before you jump in."
5,falling in love again,"I purchased the Canon BJC-8200 several months ago and i fell in love with it. Often you buy a product and it does not live up to the manufacturers claims. This printer does. The picture quality even at maximum elargement is , in a word, fantastic. I have a mid-range non professional digital camera and the printer produced outstanding professional looking copies. I took some pictures of a friends wedding and sent the pictures to them, they were thrilled with the prints. They could not believe this quality from a home printer. I believe at any price you wont find a better product. The separate Ink cartridges, a must for anyone. It flat out saves money. The ease of use, incredible. I am no pro, but you would never believe that if you saw the prints from this product. Look no further, buy this, you will be happy with it."
4,interesting read,"This is a great book for general information. It's nice to have a little tidbit to read every morning, kind of like those daily calenders where you rip off the top page for the next day's advice. The title is very true to the work so if you are looking for a how too, or a spell book this is not for you. It is a good reference however for the background into wicca."
3,neat-but kinda dissapointing,its neat to be able to get up and look up waht happened that day in the past but i thought it was going to be more withcraft and less folklore
1,OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!@#$!@#,mine brok afer 2 dayz of use. i cant aford a reel pet so i thought dis wold be good. i need a friend. thumbs down.
2,definitely not for the faint of heart...,"Although the first chapter is simply written, the rest of the book is not. It doesn't explain the information it presents in an understandable way. Yes, there are problems at the end of the chapters to help facilitate understanding. But there are no answers to the questions! So you cannot check yourself on how you do on the problems.If you want to learn about SDT, read ""Detection Theory: A User's Guide"" by Macmillan and Creelman instead. Much easier to understand. Problems at the end of the chapters. AND answers to them!"
5,wonderful classics,"We've seen the movies, but the books - I don't think I ever read them. They are terrific, Chandler deserves his reputation as being the top of the line, the Cadillac of mystery writers. I can't put this book down. It's wonderful to read about how California was back in the '30s."
1,Bogus Lava Lamp,Heat Coil in bottom already broken. Forty watt bulb does nothing... Not happy with product.
1,bbrrrrr is best,Unless you collect junk in form of movies save your money.This flick done so pooooorly even I was surprized. You will be familiar with reality you avoid in your own contry.
1,not good!,"Only one good song - the cats meowing to silent night!! the rest is very amatuerish (spelled right??). the singing is terrible, and the music is not much better."
1,Beware -- none of the works included are complete,"The product description says ""A collection of Steinbeck's work."" It fails to say ""excerpts from Steinbeck novels."" In other words it does any of his complete novels -- just parts selected."
1,Never have so many trees died for so little reason,"I owe Mr Clarke a debt of gratitude. It is thanks to his writing style that I am an MCSE and not a CNA or CNE. The book is thick, which is appropriate--anyone who could get through this thing must needs be pretty thick himself. The jokes and cartoons are annoying without being in the least bit diverting. NetWare itself is hardly the most exciting OS on the market, but this is ridiculous! Don't waste your money."
2,"Save trees and readers, please.","All knowledge this book offers is well hidden behind all those jokes and ""zen"" things. It's a good book for people who want to train how to distinguish between useful and useless information.Very low information/page ratio."
1,Confusing,"This book takes all the fun from learning. It inserts ""dummies"" type humor through out that is distracting. The book is very hard to follow and it constantly refers to other chapters in the book without a link. It also refers to web sites rather than a more detailed explanation.If I didn't have to buy this book for a college class, I wouldn't have bought it at all."
2,It *could've* been a good book...but it's not.,"There are two types of CNE students in this world: Those that love this book and those that loathe it. I was severely disappointed to find that, although the cover of the book tells you that the official Novell courses are inside, they're not in any specific order! I don't know about the rest of you, but I take one test at a time...and that's how I'd like to study for them. There's an index at the back that tells you which pages to read to follow Novell's cirriculum for a specific course, but it's 10 pages here, 5 pages there, 2 or 3 pages here, 30 pages there...on and on and the the material may span 1000 pages or more. I don't understand the thinking when putting this book together. I bought it at another store and returned it. My time is too valuable than to subject myself to this."
4,More than complete,"I found this book to be very helpful. I wanted to take all exams that were current in the IntraNetWare 4.11 track, even though I had previous exams to use for CNE credit. With this book, and the Core Technologies book from the same author, I tested all exams and passed them well above Instructor level in exactly 30 days. I read and used the test index in the back of the book to study. The cartoons, zen, and puzzles all served to ease up the cramming when I wanted. When I was not interested in these items, I simply skipped them. Although there were a number of spelling errors, the content is still solid! I was so impressed that I even backordered the IntraNetWare 5.0 book, which is upcoming! Mr. Clarke, keep 'em coming!!!"
4,very nice,I just put this new comforter on my bed and it fits wonderfully (Queen) I can't wait to climb in under it tonight !! It is very soft and looks like it will keep us nice and comfy and warm.
3,Not nearly as nice as I expected,I purchased this based on another review and the information in the listing... that it was a winter down weight. I found it to be the same weight as my summer one but 4 x's the price. I found one at sams club that was 3 x's as thick for $60.
2,"Buggy software, lousy support","This is a great player in and of itself, but God help you if you have problems with it. For reasons no one at Samsung can identify, my laptop no longer recognizes my MP3 player. I spent an hour on tech support with Samsung, and the end result was the tech throwing his hands up in exasperation, mailing me a new driver disk, and telling me to try that. I received the disk and tried to reinstall the drivers, but the computer still does not recognize the device. I tried installing the player on two other machines and had the same problem.A follow-up call to Samsung resulted with the basic response that I should just buy a new player.If you like truly awful support, I highly recommend Samsung's products. :)"
2,I thought it was exactly what I wanted,"I had the same problem others have - I upgraded to RealOne without realizing that it wouldn't support the player. When I uninstalled RealOne and tried to put RealJukebox back, it won't install properly, so I can't change the music on my machine. Very frustrating. If someone has a solution, let me know."
2,Beware XP user!!,"I bought this product last year and was very happy with it. Sure the Real Jukebox software was clumsy and the USB transfer rate is slow, but anyone can overcome that. What you can't overcome is using this product after upgrading your OS to XP. I reloaded the Jukebox software that came with the unit and couldn't get the thing to read out the song list or re-format to change out the songs. After upgrading to RealOne, I discovered there is no support for the Samsung Yepp Hip-Hop 64. Now I have to listing to the same 20 songs over and over and over again."
4,Samsung Yepp really is Hip-Hop!,"I purchased the Samsung Yepp 64MB player for my 15 year old daughter in December. She had very little problems following instructions and downloading her favorite songs. She is a runner and enjoys listening to music. It has been excellant! We did purchase a different head set, but other than that, I would highly recommend it to anyone! The best part for me was Amazons great price."
1,No XP Drivers,I bought this as an X-mas gift for family. Found out that there were no XP drivers available. Customer service told my bro that they had no intention of developing any.
4,Cable Problem,"The player is great.......I bought this because I wanted good quality music and a compact player. There was only one thing wrong, the cable it came with was defective. My computer did not recognize the cable from the mp3 player. I switched the usb port and the scanner still worked, i installed the usb port manualy, it useually does it by itself, then i even downloaded help files from samsungs help page, finaly i talked to someone on tech support and he said it was just a rare problem, a defective cable. This is very rare, the guy at tech suport was amazed about how much I knew about mp3 players, and said I should be working there..So if you have any questions just email me at MytTy@aol.com And remember keep your invoice in a safe spot if something does go wrong, you can send it back easily to replace it."
1,Samsung should stick to toasters,"Received this item as a Christmas gift. When I tried to install it (on a current, clean Compaq running Windows Me)I ran into the biggest driver problems I have EVER seen setting up ANY hardware. I followed not only the information that came with the Yepp (which when it comes to set-up leaves a lot to be desired) but also the supposed ""fixes"" for driver problems that are on the Samsung Yepp web page.No luck.Then called the Yepp 800 number for support three times, which resulted in three different people giving me three completely different sets of directions (""it's your Windows, uh...no, it's your hard drive...uh, no, it's the set up CD...). When one of these so-called ""engineers"" told me ""well, we get at least 8 phone calls a day with this problem"" I knew I was dealing with a product that was NOT finalized when it was thrown out onto the market. Bottom line: the Yepp was returned to the store. Want a user friendly Digital Audio player? Look elsewhere!"
3,"High Quality Sound, Small, Really Slow Data Transfer","The Yepp Hip-Hop is everything you read. Small, light, great sound quality (especially if you buy better headphones, the ones that come with it I dislike), and best MP3 price/performance/memory ratio to date IMHO (Aug, 17, 2001).But I have to add that the data transfer rate for this is not good, even though it uses USB, transfering 64MB to the player takes waaaaaaaay to long. This isn't a reason not to buy it, but you'll have to schedule your life around this fact."
2,"Disappointing, insufficient coverage of XP pro, irrelevant","Don't waste your money on this one unless you never used any version of windows at all. While simple topics are given extensive and repetitive coverage, many advanced items are sketchy, if addressed at all. Many pages are devoted to such irrelevant subjects as how to start with scripting and HTML. At the same time it gives less than 1 page (yes, less than one!)to a subject like IIS. Overall, very poor coverage of admin tools and very few examples of best practices. Recently I had a chance to look through Windows XP inside out. I wish I bought that one instead.."
4,Learing Windows XP,This book covers the basics and advanced inner workings of Windows XP. I bought this book to help me with:1. Password and Multiuser Environments2. Home Networking and Peer to Peer Setup3. Customizing windows for users4. Windows Network Sharing Setup5. Login Help with Passwords and User EnvirnmentsThis book will help you get around Windows XP and set it up the way you want.
3,Agree with the other reviewers,"While I like the book style, it does not get into many of the details of XP. It is very much just a high-level overview meant for the newbie. Some technical mistakes. I would not recommend to a friend."
4,Things that don't belong.,"Chapter 15 Windows XP Professional Networking and Network Design Primer does not belong in this book. Why? Because this book has the word ""Mastering"" in the title and if you need a Network Primer you are ways off from becoming an XP Master. Seriously the content of this chapter is very good for the TCP/IP Study Guides or Networking Essentials Books, but not in this book. Seems like the author had the chapter written and already on hand for those other books, and just decided to throw it in."
4,He who will be angry for anything will be angry for nothing,"John Osborne's play, upon which this movie is based, ushered in a whole slew of ""angry young men"" plays - all about young Bristishers who spit vitriol at post-War England and all it stood for. Richard Burton has the role of the angry Jimmy Porter, a university-educated man who would rather sell candy in an open market, play jazz trumpet at night, and, most of all, abuse his wife. His performance is stunning (it got him noticed here in the States), but he is just so full of anger at seemingly everything that it's hard to focus sympathy on him. With Britain losing its powerful place in the world after all the sacrifices made during two world wars, such frustrated indignation might appear justifiable, but so much of it seems like raging against the wind: it doesn't seem connected to the humanness of the emotion - it's too detached. The movie, like the play, has some great dialogue, however, and it's very well photographed."
5,That's Acting,There are great performances by many great actors. but Burton's portrayal of Jimmy Porter is in a class by itself----even with a stellar supporting cast Burton is impossible to catch and even the audience needs to hang on to keep up with the pace. One of the most memorable screen performances in the history of cinema.
2,A Lot of Anger,"I though a classic would naturally be great, but this simply isn't. The story is contrived and implausible, and the acting is so overwrought you wonder if the director was on the set. Richard Burton's sudden mood shifts are so jarringly abrupt, that it's like a switch was thrown on the script. Do not bother with this. It's a nice touch of gritty England, but also gritty writing, directing, and action, as in clogging up the works."
4,Gary Raymond,"The standout for me was this underrated handsome Brit who later wound up on ""Rat Patrol"" as Sgt. Moffitt. He plays Porter's pal who bears the anger and trumpet outbursts.Nice period piece. Always good to watch Claire Bloom,, too."
1,"Another cutesy, light-weight, pop-psychology, feel good book","I put this book on the top of my list of books that needn't be read. A four page pamphlet would have been a more appropriate forum.In fact, four lines would do it:1. Simplify--you don't need everything you've accumulated, including material goods, attitudes, beliefs, and relationships.2. Learn to enjoy the process, and quit focusing on the ultimate goal.3. Humor is a basic food group: make sure you have some every day.4. At the end of each day you should be able to say ""this was a day well lived."""
5,Essential Reference,"Don't let the ""2002"" in the title mislead you. This book is a valuable reference for Access 2003. If you are serious about the VBA programming, especially in Microsoft's Access, this book is essential. I have worked with the authors' and Access 97 and their Access 2000 versions and would have gone to their Access 2003 to version if it had been published. I agree with the publisher's choice to stick with the 2002 version because of the relative few changes to Access. Just last week, I referred to the textbook to see how to identify a control on a subform.A second book I would recommend for VBA programmers is ""Excel 2003: Power Programming with VBA"" by John Walkenbach. Although this book focuses on VBA with Excel, the models and the presentation help develop a much richer understanding of VBA."
2,The mini reproduction catalog,"My copy of this 1923 reproduction catalog was a mini-reproduction and not much fun to read. If you're like me, you're buying this thing because you're obsessed by history and the way things were and you enjoy studying the itty-bitty print and fine details.If you want to learn more about Sears and read the ad copy in their old catalogs, I'd hold out for the 1908 (full size repro) or the 1927 (full size). This diminuitive reproduction is so very hard to read that it takes all the joy out of the process.Rose Thorntonauthor, The Houses That Sears Built"
4,OK.,"Would be nice if it were full-sized, but it's still interesting. I didn't think the size spoiled the format."
2,This is a - What's New in Vegan Processed Foods- Magazine,"I have been receiving this publication for a year now and will not be renewing.If you interested in Highly processed vegan foods, then this is the magazine for you.It's a what's new and on the market now, type magazine.... There is little, to no information onwhole foods and healthy living, and very little in the way of recipes, except those offered by ads, promoting their processed products. Very dissapointed."
2,Disappointed in the content,"It's perhaps my fault that I thought this would offer more of recipes and lifestyle tips. I feel like this magazine is all over the place without knowing where it wants to go. I won't renew my subscription. While Urban Farming isn't ""vegetarian"", to me it offers more sustainable tips for the lifestyle that I'm trying to live."
5,Best Magazine Out There,"This is my all time favorite magazine! Loads of vegan information that everyone should read and everyone can benefit from. I truely respect what VegNews does with the magazine and website. Awesome colors, articles, recipes and info. Thank you VegNews!"
1,Disappointing,"I've been a subscriber for years, but then it's changed, it's less interesting, too political and heavy on soy, on their website they remove negative comments and their choice to let Piraro drawn and write his racist messages and to do the same with Rory Freedman and her trashy style and silly opinions.....made me decide to unsubscribe."
4,Not for Me,"This was a gift, my neice said she likes it and thats whats important. Not much else to say. thanks"
1,[...] Blow in cards,This is a really good magazine with Solid editorialon the world of Veggieness.[...]Take a look at the larger picture if you don'tbelieve me.The magazine currently has blow-in cards witha $20 subscription price WITH a pint of ice creame.
2,Several children who read it were unimpressed,"Having read some of Stephen Lankton's professional texts, I had high hopes for this book. However, the book did not live up to my expectations. I read it to several children and they felt that there was not much substance to the book. (The kids actually put their comments in much more direct English)The book uses metaphorical language as well as direct insturction to help children who have specific fears (phobias.) In the story, a more experienced child, Knowsis, helps another child, Terry deal with her fears of the circus. Knowsis teaches Terry to access feelings of confidence and contentment. He then shows her how to experience these feelings when she is in a frightening situation.The theory behind this book is good. However it just does not translate well in this book format. Into The Great Forest is a better picture book for helping children with fears."
4,Unknown gem,"One of my favourites as a child. This book is all about survival. Relatively short, easy reading. Wish it was available for kindle!"
3,The Truth Behind the Medical Industry,This book is a great way to understand why we have a problem today in the health industry. Sue does a great job at breaking down the facts and giving us indisputable conclusions.
4,Sturdy as can be,I've thrown some pretty heavy items on my garage shelves and these brackets don't even come close to breaking a sweat. Buy with confidence.
4,The film did not deserve a soundtrack this good!,"Fat bass, Fender Rhodes and wordless vocals ? Another stone classic from David Holmes!The vibe has a definite 70s cop film soundtrack feel to it, think Lalo Schifrin and Goblin. Those who were into his DJ projects or the greasy funk snippets on Out of Sight soundtrack are in for a treat.This is not ""upbeat jazzy"" score, rather, it's a hot slab of gritty, greasy, trashy, cinematic funk. Delicious!"
3,it's ok,"bought this to replace my 94 year old mother's other, worn out commode. unfortunately, it came missing the deflector insert and bucket. I had to use the one from the old commode. AND, when I assembled the legs onto the frame, it was a little wobbly. Mom also said it pinches her legs sometimes between the seat and frame. Had to ""pad"" it to keep it from pinching."
5,TMS does it again and again - many thanks!,"A simple must for all professional developers - I've had the book three days and cannot put it down although I've had to as my head will surely explode - it's already started to expand (and my daily rate with it too!).The best chapters are for me (so far) are:On Error GoTo Hell, Taking Care of Business, Minutiae, VB's Guide to Dating (a Y2K MUST read), Starting with the Bases Loaded, Databases are for Dorks, Accessibility in VB.Nicely written and researched and written by some very well informed people.Thanks again."
2,"Decent book, but lots of 'too specific' information.","This book has a few good chapters in it ""On Error GoToHell"" - on errors, ""Minutiae"" on compiler options andother usually overlooked Visual Basic optimizations, ""Well, at Least it compiled OK!"" on testing, ""Starting With Bases Loaded"" on base code, ""Mixing Languages with Visual Studio"" and ""Didn't I Write That Function Last WeeK?"" on code reuse. I didn't read the chapters on IIS, databases and CE (if I wanted a book about these subjects, I would buy one). The most surprising chapters dealt with enterprise development and ""How to Find, Recruit, and Retain Great Developers"" which were just plain out of scope. TMS authors' should write about VB6 in a VB6 book. Those chapters should be elsewhere - maybe a management book. I also did not like the Accessibility in Visual Basic chapter which dealt with making your programs for disabled people. Also, the dating and programming with variant chapters were frivolous and not ""advanced"" at all."
2,Way too verbose. Not enough code.,"This book seems to be a lot about nothing. Don't get me wrong, some of the chapters were ok, like the On Error GOTO Hell, and the appendix on coding conventions. But, if you're looking for someting to teach you how to do something in VB, forget it."
1,worst book I have ever read,"There are unrelated and unorganized chapters written by different authors. The book is actually about ""software development"". The authors express their experience. Also titles are so funny some examples :""Here Be Dragons"",""Dancing in Step"",""Using Smoke and mirors"" etc.I am sorry that I bought this book."
1,VB ramblings,"One of the few books I've bought that I'll probably not refer back to again. This book needed a strong editor to turn competent programmers into good writers. The book rambled aimlessly, not really giving a hint as to where they were going or why one piece of info related to another. I know we all need our 15 minutes of fame, but each chapter's autobiographical data was a little over the top."
2,Deals with concepts more than using features of VB6,"This book is good reading if you don't think you are getting a 'technical reference' to aid you in using the advanced features of VB6. There are so many witty comments in this book, it seems it would be sitting on a coffee table rather than next to your workstation. These are the writings of self-praising individuals who refer to ""we at TMS"" more times than one can count. This book is definately not for those who are seeking books that explain how things work at a deeper level in VB6, and discussions on advanced features are not very well expanded. It is far too dificult to muddle though the jibberish to find what you are looking for. The title shold be ""How TMS uses Visual Basic 6."""
2,Beyond advanced,More of a 'Special Topics' book. Don't expect to run through an introductory book and right into this one. Though the first chapter has some useful suggestions for handling bugs.
1,A Waste of Time and Money,If your looking for technical information on the How's and Why's of VB6 this is not the book. This book is for those with to much time on their hands not someone who is looking for answers. The authors are to be commended for their corruption of significant technical information into useless pros. A good door stop!
1,Sorely disappointed,"The title of this book should be ""How TMS implements VB""If you're an Intermediate VB programmer who's looking to expand his/her skills, don't buy this book. I learnt this lesson the hard way.This book is not really an Advanced book. Its really a super-advanced book with many special and arcane topics. There is good technical info at times but it is few and far in between. The book rambles along aimlessly. There is little explanation as to how one topic relates to another.The authors are knowledgable in their fields but extremely conceited. They also try to be witty all the time. Gets tedious after a while. There are too few examples and too much prose."
5,Witness for the Prosec,I thought this was an excting movie and it has a surprise ending. Kept me in suspense the whole time watching it. I have watched it 3 times in case I missed something.
4,Witness review,"I remember when this movie came out many years ago it caused quite a stir. Great PR to get viewers to not reveal the surprise ending. A stellar cast, Charles Laughton, Marlena Deitrich, Elsa Lanchester(in a part created for the movie which is not in the play) and Tyrone Power. Billy Wilder directing. What's not to like? Plenty I'm afraid. The film just does not hold up, mostly because of the extensive scenery chewing by the cast. I'm surprised there was any scenery left for them to film in front of."
5,Witness For the Prosecution,"This is one of the all time greatest murder mystery movies I've ever seen. It has a phenomenal cast. I don't want to give anything away with details of the story, but suffice it to say this is a ""must-see"" for all murder mystery lovers, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"
5,Witness for the Prosecution,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all times. My brother and I were youngsters and luckily we were allowed to stay up late when the movie came on. We were mezmerized throughout. The ending blew us away, and we've talked about it for years. They just don't make movies like that anymore. I recommend it whole-heartedly!!!!"
4,PERFECT :-),"Well..almost. I just saw this movie a few days ago for the first time, but I've seen it several times since. The beginning of the film may seem a bit longer than it is...Not boring...The movie is really dominated by Charles Laughton and his outstanding performance. He ""spices"" up every scene he is in, with his funny comments. The leading lady is the one and only Marlene Dietrich. It has been said that this is her finest performance since ""The Blue Angel"" and I would say that it's not far from the truth.The ""action"" really starts when they all hit courtroom. A scene where many lies and ""truths"" come out.Anyway, I would say that Charles Laughton and Marlene Dietrich really holds the film to it's standards.Just see it for yourself...but remember that the truth may not be as simple as it seems."
5,WITNESS,GREAT PRICE GREAT MOVIE IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THE GOOD OLD MOVIES TO FALL BACK ON AND SHOW YOUR CHILDREN.
5,Witness for the prosecution,I would not hesitate to encourage all my friends who has a particular interest in court cases like I do.
5,The way films ought to be,"They don't make movies like this anymore. If you're looking for a mystery, you pretty much can't go wrong with Agatha Christie. You won't be disappointed or bored in any way."
3,Mostly For Go Historians,"I enjoyed this book for the historical trivia it contains as well as the authentic Japanese terms. However, as a pratical tool for Go Beginners, most Westerners will have trouble with this one. If you are familiar with Go, and of Dan level you will most likely enjoy the later problems (which are very complex).In all fairness, I think some reviewers have judged this book too harshly. Taking into account the time the book was first published and the lack of go material available then, this book does an adequate job in what it sets out to do: inform Westerners about Go. It is a pity that it is written more like a college essay than a book, and never really expresses the passion that Go players feel for this game."
1,This book is not useful as an introduction to the game,"The Game of Go by Arthur Smith is not a good choice for getting someone started in the game. The examples are of poor quality and confusing. Like the book by Lasker this is primarily of historic interest - it was written many years ago before good introductory books were available. Better to start with Go for Beginners by Iwamoto or the introductory series by Janice Kim. Also the beginning book by Cho Chikun. For teaching young children look at Milton Bradley's book (the go player, not the game company)."
3,"Good History, but too wide a range of skill","This book contains a good history of the game and is, in fact, historical as the first English book on Go. Although aimed at beginners this book misses its mark. The first few sections of the book describing the rules of the game are accurate enough, but the descriptions of ""Joseki"" and other elements are definitely not beginner oriented.Perhaps the worst part for beginners, and the best for Single digit kyu and dan level amateurs (intermediate to strong players) are the problems, which are said to have been taken from classical Japanese work. These cannot possibly be thought of as beginner problem and will likely challange most. Some variations in the answers show 10+ moves.The most interesting part of this book is its historical value. First printed in 1908, this book is no longer under copyright."
3,Great Gag Gift,I purchased this as a gag gift for a friend who like me is a big Godfather (Marlon Brando) fan. I haven't watched it nor I suspect the recipient will.
1,hmmm.....,"this movie was alright. too much of a blaxploitataion film, but otherwise ok. why didnt anyone catch him tho?"
4,Keeps hands busy!,"I bought this set to bring to church so my 8 yr would sit quietly and be busy. It has worked like a charm. He loves putting these pictures together. It is a quiet, still way to entertain him. Even my 14 yr old daughter enjoyed putting them together as well. I will say that the sticky mosaics by ""Orb"" are a little nicer than these by Lauri Toys - they just look better when you're done - more symetrical or something (that's the accountant in me coming out!). However, the fun in this is making the craft not really in looking at it afterward - so I say buy the least expensive one!"
3,"Good for security and replication info, but VERY redundant","To it's credit, this book was helpful to internalize the replication and security principles of AD. And understandably, some people would rather sit down with a book than read online documentation. But like 80% of the books out there, I've read most of Microsoft's white papers on the subject, and unfortunately, I didn't gain much more from this book. While it has many helpful facts, those facts are readily accessible from AD docs. The other problem I have is the fact that certain facts are repeated six, seven, even eight times. The first seven chapters could have been pared down to two. Granted, I'm sure it was a push to get the book done as quickly as possible to keep the info current, but I'm going searching for a better work."
2,Not enough substance,"I am finishing this book as I write this review, with only one more chapter left to read. My hope was that I could actually install Active Directory on Win 2000 Advanced Server RC2, and intelligently configure a Windows 2000 LAN. This book did NOT help me to realize this goal. Perhaps my expectations were out of line. If you are looking for hands-on examples and practical advice, as well as a conceptual framework for AD, you will NOT find that information here. You will find high-level discussions of many complex technologies, but no real detail on any of them. The conceptual information is barely acceptable, but may satisfy non-technical practitioners. Another reviewer commented on tiresome and redundant repetition of AD concepts, and I did find this to be the case. O'Reilly has an Active Directory title slated for release in January that looks much more promising, assum"
4,good project,"cute project for kids, came on time. have order thing from creativity for kids before and always a good gift"
2,Easy to use - but !!!,"This is easy to use with good instructions included. The three size choice of photo is excellent and the quality very good. Unfortunately this camera is very light and has no real ""feel"" to it. Also, both myself and my parents have had this camera for just over a year and both are now broken. In my opinion the build quality is not as good as it could be."
5,Great little camera,I've had this camera for a few months now and I'm very pleased with it. The quality of the pictures is good for such a low price. It's just a fun little camera to mess around with...so get it.
5,The Amazing do nothing Elmo,"This Elmo is wonderful, is does nothing, no singing, no dancing, no tickling and it is my grandson's favorite Elmo. He can hold it and snuggle with it and nap with it without fear of injury from hard internal parts. This is the way a child's cuddle toy needs to be made. Great construction, no fear of parts coming off and becoming choking hazards. I recommend this toy to all true Elmo fans."
5,Love it!!,"I bought this for my daughter's 14 month birthday. She immediately loved Cookie and Elmo (I bought the matching pair).They were softer and more beautiful than I expected and they have proven more durable than I'd hoped. She feeds them every time she eats but by some miracle they still look great.When they arrived, they were packed in polka dotted tissue paper and the eyes were carefully wrapped. It was fun to open such a treasure! These are definitely my daughter's favorite stuffed animals and she'll have them for years!"
2,"Elmo ""Reject""","I've ordered several Plush Elmo's over past few years, made by Sesame St and Gund. Gund's body material is more shaggy while Sesame St. is more velveteen-like material. Unfortunately, I really feel this particular Elmo should have been left in the reject pile and donated to charity, not sold to consumer. The left leg is totally twisted. It was a Christmas gift for a 13 mo old who adores Elmo, but also puts it in her mouth. I have noticed pieces of red material on the rug. This never happened with my other Elmo purchases. I was disappointed that they sent an inferior product."
3,Elmo toy,"I was somewhat disappointed with this toy. It may be a Gund, but was not as soft or as substantial as I thought it would be."
5,beyond deconstruction,"What a joy to read -- alternately funny, sad, intelligent, WICKED. In a way this novel is a classic deconstruction of Mary S's brilliant but youthful novel; but it is much more than that, since (I think) it takes on language itself as a topic. How it makes us even as we think we are using it and mastering it. I was also really turned on by the history elements, about race and class, and I actually cried a couple of times, WAY out of the ordinary for me reading a novel. Most contemporary best selling and mainstream novels are BORING and DONE TO DEATH. This is definately something different. CHIASMUS is doing things differently. I bought another of this authors books and was not disappointed."
2,Why not expand the novella?,"The novella is what makes the book worth buying, given that it is the only part of this collection where one does not feel the need to cry out, ""So what?"" The stories attempt to mimic the setting and feel of Sherwood Anderson's <Winesburg, Ohio>, but come off feeling like a cheap perfume imitation. The characters leave one feeling as if the author intended to create conversations among beings possessed with artificial intelligence, a Frankensteinian Monster gone wrong. The exigency for this collection seems forced, as a result of too much writing and not enough depth"
4,novella heaven,"My new age lit. prof. asked us to choose from three modern authors: I found this one, and boy was I surprised to learn that the novella is a form many people are not familiar with--Beth Lordan has helped revived that form for Fiction 3102. Two students in our class are now writing novellas after our week's study of ""Both Shall Row""."
3,The title says it all.,"Riker and Troi. The cover art for these two novels even feature them. The love story needs to be told and it has been.This story starts with the Enterprise being sent a troubled planet where there is no real way to solve the problem. The population is turning violent and the crew is stretched thin trying to put out the fires, both literally and figuratively.This is a wonderful character study of not just the regular cast but as well as new character including the security chief. In addition we get to explore Riker search for his father and struggle with the ailing relationship.I was disappointed in the clichés used in the end of the first part of the story. Riker finding his father at gunpoint and Crusher informing Picard that the cure for this planet is also the cause of the disaster it is facing. It gave me a false sense of expectations for the second part."
5,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed the book but it's the most blunt cliffhanger I've ever read. This book ends mid paragraph. Oh well, I guess I'm off to the kindle bookstore."
1,Illogical and unlikely behavior from characters just to make the plot work,"Together with ""A time to hate"", there are numerous Illogical and unlikely behavior from characters just to make the plot work. Namely, Beverly Crusher's attitude towards the EMH. In the previous two books ""A time to sow"" and ""A time to harvest"", the CMO didn't have that much of an animosity towards the EMH to call upon him during the crisis. I had to admit that the cause of the problem to the two races on the planet is very ingenious and clever. However, in the novel, there were just so many unlikely behavior from the characters just to make the plot work and to make the problem seem like a ever growing snow ball. I never got so mad at the characters and the author when reading a novel."
4,A good Book,"A good book. It starts off a little slow, like most ST books, but you get very invovled in the story. You will most likely immerse your mind in the plot. The best part of this book is that it goes in the next book A Time To Hate very well, it makes you want to read the second on."
3,"Good, entertaining, but not outstanding","A TIME TO LOVE is well written and a good read. I enjoyed it, but honestly I think it and A TIME TO HATE could have been one book. The funny thing in ""LOVE"" is that on page 100 Troi beams back to the Enterprise, but on page 101 she is clearly still on the surface of the planet with Picard. I found this goof hilarious but forgivable. All in all, ""LOVE,"" is worth reading."
5,Brilliant overlooked comedy,"I watched this again on DVD recently and was depressed that this brilliant and laugh-out-loud comedy was overlooked and was not renewed in Fall 2007. The casting, writing, directing are all spot-on. Even the pilot ep is good- which doesn't often happen. This series should have run at least 2 years. Buy or rent the DVD- you won't be sorry."
5,Most Wonderful Pop Music,"Finally, this 18 years old (!) record is available on CD! WHo cares, you might ask. Well ""No Sense Of Sin"" is not just any pop album of the eighties. It's one that really stands out, and continues to have its own magic even in the new millenium. Unfortunately, the ""Lotus Eaters"" didn't become pop stars at this time, despite their surprise hit-single ""The First Picture Of You"". Yet they aren't a ""single hit wonder"". The entire album is full of stunning pop songs with great melodies and wonderful vocal and instrumental arrangements. The mood of this album is clearly contemplative and unobtrusive throughout. If you like balladesque, smooth pop music, this record is about the best you can get."
1,Disgusting texture and flavor,"If cat food was recommended for humans to eat, this would be it. This, in no way, resembled a lobster spread, cream cheese, or any sort of fish-based dip."
5,DVD Widescreen Transfer Is Perfect,"I must elaborate more on the reviewer who said that the transfer to DVD looked like it had been dragged through a vat of mud. I had the movie on VHS tape and knew what to expect of it. The reviewer may have only noted the first 6-7 minutes of the movie which I would call a dream sequence with shades of different colors around the screen. Once this sequence is over, the movie is normal and the transfer to DVD which I rented was perfect. The movie was just as it is on my VHS tape but of better quality, of course."
4,Topkapi,"What do you get when you put Melina Mercouri, Peter Ustinov, Maximilian Schell, Robert Morley, Akim Tamiroff, et. al., together? An unlikely crew of sophistcated bumblers thrown together to pull off a heist that is both very dangerous, and very funny. The actual robbery scene, done in complete silence, without music or effects, is a heart stopper I have never seen duplicated in motion pictures. So, if an international cast and an exotic location is your cup of tea, give Topkapi a look."
5,rififi....,"A band of thieves, assembled by a deliciously intent Mercouri, attempts to steal a fabulous emerald-encrusted dagger from the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul. The utimate theft is depicted in a long sequence reminiscent of his earlier heist scene-but this time with considerably more levity. Dassin assembled a flawless cast of charming rogues and charlatans, including Peter Ustinov in an especially humorous performance that earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. If you are not a WT, then it is a very nice movie for you...."
4,A Delightful Adventure,"Ustinov is over the top, but won an academy award as best supporting actor for this little romp. The idea is based on the cliche of robbing a secure museum. Robert Morely steals the show, by the way. He's as good as Ustinov, and just as funny."
3,Classic Ustinov and great fun.,"For classic movie buffs, this Ustinov performance is a must see. For first time travelers to Istanbul, watch Topkapi first."
3,Ustinov Carries This Heist Flick,"Heist stories are usually appealing to me, and this one is, too, despite the fact the actual jewelry heist doesn't take place until the last 15 minutes out of two-hour movie! Today, this would probably be considered way too slow, compared to most modern crime movies.Nonetheless, I thought the story of it all was interesting enough to keep one's attention, Peter Ustinov won honors for his performance which, indeed, steals the spotlight from the two others stars of the film, Melina Mercouri and Maximllian Shell.There is decent photography in here and some good Greek music which plays throughout the film. It gives the movie a unique flavor, something akin to the zither played in ""The Third Man."""
4,"Good for kids, and for Mom","I have been very happy with this house, and so have the kids!The kids love:The very cool sounds. (The toilet even flushes, endlessly delighting the preschool set.)The gadgets. This thing is LOADED with accessories, enough for a lot of playtime.Mom loves:The sounds can be TURNED OFF. Big bonus in my book!!It folds up and fits nicely against the wall. Great for those with less than huge play areas.Enough stuff to accommodate two to three children playing at the same time.One caveat:Be prepared to purchase a small container for the extra pieces. They really do NOT fit inside the house (despite the claim)."
5,Overpriced,"What is up with Amazon? Is this a joke? I got this at Toys R Us for around $30 last year. I usually love amazon, but do not buy this from amazon unless you just need to blow some bucks."
4,Great Job!,"Amazon was amazing. I was looking at the Barbie doll house that sells for approximately 100.00 and was not impressed with the reviews that it received. I did not want to spend all that money and not be happy with the product. I was surfing the web and accidently came upon this playset. I thought this is the right product for my 7 yr old daughter. Just right for the money. I was surprised to find that they were discontinuing this model. I surfed Kmart, Walmart and Target some had it and some didn't. If the store had it they could not guarentee the shipping by Christmas. Not only did Amazon have it, but they told me exactly when I was going to receive it and I didn't have to pay extra for speedy shipping. Next year I am going to buy all my gifts for Christmas from Amazon."
3,Very Cute,My 2 daughters got this very cute doll house as a Christmas gift and they love it very much. The reason why I gave it a 3 stars was because the sound doesn't work and the washer and dryer also do not spin. Seeing as that was almost the whole reason why it was given to them I gave it 3 stars. But the lack of sound and spinning aside my girls still play with it all of the time. Like someone else posted you will need a little ziplock bag and a small storage box for the pieces that come with it. It is very cute though and I would still recomend it.
4,Happy grandma,"I purchased the Barbie house for my granddaughter who is 5 yrs old. Sheloves it and plays with it for hours. I like the way it is so compact,yet has a lot of play things with it. Good deal for the dollars."
4,Good House,I ordered this house for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It had a million pieces to put together but it is worth it. My infant son loves to push the doorbell and the toilet. Great Barbie house!
3,Price gouging!!!,"Bought this for $112, but it's going right back. In doing some other online shopping, I saw the exact same item on other sites for $30! This is ridiculous. As for the actual product, it's well worth thirty dollars and looks to be very cute from what I can tell from the outside of the box."
3,Random selection,"Kombi was one of the most important Polish ensembles of the 80s. They revolutionarized the pop new wave trend in our part of the world. One of their early albums was the first one I ever got on the vinyl - thus I am sentimental.Unfortunately, ""15 Lat"" is a mediocre selection of songs, not only nonrepresentative for their work, but also including songs that have never been popular, and omitting the really important ones. This is not just my subjective opinion - we all remember the top charts of the ""Radio III"" from the blessed 80s.Another complaint that I might make is that the songs have been thrown into a bag and the order they appear in on the CD seems to be random. A good collection must be appealing and thought over. This is not the case here."
2,"FUN at First, BORING at Last","Tamagotchi is a really neat toy. Everyone loves it at first. But when you start getting use to it, it gets boring. Most of the time it grows up to be the same character and even though you could connect with a friend, it's the same game or same present over and over again. I bought 2 of them and its sitting next to the dust right now. I recommend not buying more than 2. I think 1 is enough for most of people."
3,Arizona Ranch Owner Inherits English Country Estate...,"Upon her father's death, 23-year-old Nell discovers she has inherited a ruined British estate through her deceased mother's line. Thus, Nell decides to take a tour of Europe with a family friend and end the visit with a tour of the inheritance. Nell embarks on a journey of discovery and meets some interesting characters along the way, which include a formidable great-aunt, an over-diligent village policeman, an eccentric secretary/dress-maker, a dusty middle-aged solicitor and congenial archeologist. The story makes for a pleasant, feel-good read."
2,good or bad? the advert and photos HIDE the I/O and charging info,"""We sent a man to the moon, but we can't...""...can't make a MP3/WMA player that recharges by the USB port?(they exist, but currently sold by no-name offshore vendors)OMITTED by this advertisement and photo series is critical info needed by any buyer of average intelligence:1. It does NOT SHOW the USB interface,2. It does NOT mention whether it can be charged directly from the USB port.The technology and packaging look snazzy, but I will wait for full disclosure of spec from a manufacturer that doesn't hide needed information."
3,pretty good,"Pretty good condition, supposedly i'm reviewing a blue player ,but was really sent a black one. Besides from the difference in color, it has good sounds and some features and easy to store music on. The battery life is shorter than most players and would be reasonable to charge everyday.Overall its pretty unique"
1,Good ideas. Extremely short life. Customer service?,"The mobiBlu DAH-1500i MP3 player promises a lot, and delivers most of it during it's very short life.Do not buy this MP3 player, if:a. you want an MP3 player that will last more than six monthsb. you want technical supportc. you want warranty supportd. you want any support from the manufacturerThe one-man company mobiBluAmerica, went out of business. The Korean arm of mobiBlu also appears to have gone out of business."
5,VB Steps Up and Out,"Visual Basic finally gets treated with the respect it deserves in this thoughtful and well-written work. Drawing on the work of Gamma et. al., Stamatakis offers up VB examples of the more popular design patterns with lucid and clear explanations. The sample code provided is worth the price of the book alone. A must have for any serious VB developer."
2,"Not for the beginner in Patterns, overpriced, few patterns","This book is strong in working examples of patterns in VB, but the explanations are not good enough for a beginner to patterns. I will probably get the ""other"" VB patterns book by Griver & Gellis."
1,IT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS,"I LOVE CONCERT DVDS, BUT THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN, AND I BEEN A KOOL AND THE GANG FAN ALL MY LIFE. IT IS TOO OLD. I WASTED MY MONEY"
2,Kool and the Gang DVD,Sound was not crisp. It appeared that group was lip singing some songs. The concert did not reflect my memories of seeing them live.
4,I feel a bit cheated,"The first two books gave me such a rush, and I did not feel it continued in this one. Maybe it is because the love is already established, hence the sexual tension between the two MC's is a lil less, although... well, do not want to give too much of the book away.I felt like for the ending 50 pages of manuscript were cramped into 10. There were so many unanswered questions at the end of the book, one of them being one of the major plot points in the series...But, I do give the book 4 stars, because of the solid writing, even though the plot is a bit more wobbly than in the previous two books (which both are a solid 5 stars)If you love vampire mythos, and want to see a very unique take on the genre, read it. I can honestly say you won't regret reading the books. Also check out Blood Brothers, same writer. That book was even more mind boggling than this series."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I picked this up on a whim, without any knowledge of the previous two books, figuring it'd be an amusing but trashy vampire-sex novel. I was surprised and quite happy to find it had an interesting story backed by solid writing. There were certainly a few good twists, and I found the religious aspect interesting. There were good sex scenes but they weren't tedious or boring (think LKH). Really the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ending seemed rather rushed after a big build up.I would definitely recommend this to any vampire lover, or even a general fan of the horror genre, but if you're easily offended, especially when it comes to religion, stay away. I'm putting the first two books on hold right after I finish this review, and I hope the author will write another one to tie up all the loose ends. Really a great book."
1,for the vault,"This movie will not recive my repeat viewing. The plot is adultry at a high level CEO. with very little sublty. Ruth Chatterton did'nt impress in any movie she was in that I have seen, which are not many. Walter Huston was best in Yankee doodle Dandy. This movie did not deserve the Academy rating nominations in 1936, I looked in the book at the university library."
2,Soap City,"This is by no means the great film you might expect from all the applause. It's a soap opera of the most egregious type, and the suds are compounded by the leading lady, who should have chucked it in when talkies became the rage. If you like melodrama, this is for you. If you like one-dimensional characters, you'll love the movie. And if you enjoy crying in the theater, don't miss this film. Then you can tune in the CBS daytime lineup of soaps and be in heaven. This was agony to endure."
5,FORGOTTEN CLASSIC,"Loosely interpreted version of Sinclair Lewis' best novel (arguably) springs to life on the screen as a Hollywood classic, seldom seen or mentioned anymore. Huston plays Sam Dodsworth, a bought out American businessman with plenty of time, money, and a wife with whom he's been going through the motions for years. A trip to Europe finds Mrs. Dodsworth on the hunt, first with a young David Niven, later with a young Frenchman ( Kurt), whom she's going to marry after a quick divorce in Vienna. Sam reacquaints himself, quite by accident,to Edith ( Mary Astor), a widowed American living in Southern Europe. This duo falls in love, but when Kurt's mother refuses to have her young son married to an older Mrs. Dodsworth (Chatterton), the cagey wife postpones the divorce and agrees to meet Sam to sail back to America. What follows, you'll have to see for yourself. Take it from this reviewer, the final 3 minutes are worth the price of most movies."
2,Pffft!,"This book is a waste of good wood. It consists of quotes from the works of various kabbalists without any explanation as to why the author decided to include those quotes. But worse than that -- the publisher decided to put one quote to a page. This is fine with the long quotes but the short quotes waste paper. The only reason I rated this a two rather than a one is that I finished reading it -- which really wasn't much of a chore, even though I was intensely disappointed."
3,A good starter book about Kabbalah,"One of the better books I've read on Kabbalah. The author shares some insight into the study of the deaper meanings of the Bible. He puts it in such a way that makes this form of study less mysterious. Quite frankly, I don't understand why it is so secretive to begin with."
3,"Nice, Interesting, but...","If you happened to come across a mention of the Kabbalah while checking out some other New Age books, Matt's book is for you. Starting at the very begininng of Jewish Esoteric thought, Matt develops his ideas in a clean, concise fashion, which is something new for commentators on the Kabbalah. If, on the other hand, you are a serious student of Kabbalah or have a passing familiarity with Jewish esoterica, this book will soon reduce you to boredom."
4,THE ESSENTIAL KABBALAH; THE HEAR OF JEWISH MYSTICISM,"THIS WAS A WHOLE NEW TYPE OF READING FOR ME, AN TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO GRASP JEWISH READING. GLAD I GOT IT. AND I CAUGHT A NON BELIEVER READING IT WHICH MADE HIM RETHINK HIS THOUGHT ON GOD. SO I GOT TO PASS THE FAITH ON. THANK YOU"
5,worth to buy,"Firstly, this book is worthy to those who know nothing about kabbalah and is eager wants to engage kabbalah. Secondly, this book will correct the one who reads the Bible literally without interpret its deep esoteric meaning beyond those words. Thirdly, this book is one of the best kabbalistic books i have in my collection. And lastly, humbly to tell, I am a Gentile from SE Asia and kabbalah has changed my life more spiritually."
1,"Didnt like it, couldn't read it","I must be totally honest, wanted to know more about this topic and bought this book following the recommendations @Amazon... I couldn't read more than 30'... the language is unclear and confusing, text is not ordered and doesn't create interest to keep on reading, I left it after 30'... tried to jump between pages to find something that will get me reading but didnt find anything... from my point of view it was a waste of time and money."
2,nice book,"Thank you, wonderful book - i just wished it had more actual text. Overall it was a very nice read, with a lot of nice ideas"
5,Possibly the best New Age recording ever,"I was first introduced to this album through a new age/space music program called Musical Starstreams. There are only 3 pieces on this CD, but each are full-length compositions. Of all the tracks, the first piece is the best, entitled ""Heavensent"". The name is descriptive, because it has the ability to transport you to a musical heaven simply by listening. There are long piano sections, a beautiful harp section, and still other segments played by traditional Japanese instruments. This is a seminal work in the New Age genre, and every serious library should have a copy."
2,"Works OK, but no MacOS X support","I'm reasonably happy with how this printer performs in general, and it does the job as a quick and dirty copier.However, I was extremely disappointed that Canon apparently doesn't have the slightest intention of writing MacOS X native printer drivers for it. As a workaround, I print my documents to a PDF file and then run Acrobat in the Classic environment to print from there. MacOS X PDF support is excellent, so this works quite well.Nevertheless, given Canon's disgraceful lack of support, I doubt that I'll ever buy a Canon printer again."
3,"Great idea, short on delivery.","The versatility and light-weight, compact design of this machine made it practically irresistible to an iMac man like me. But after experiencing some communication problems between the printer and my computer, and then noticing that the product is absent from the catalogs of most Macintosh dealers, I was able to determine that the Canon 545 uses a conversion cable for USB compatibility. The Canon 555, on the other hand, comes with ""hard-wired"", built-in USB capability. Only slightly larger and a few dollars more than the 545, the 555 may be the better bet for most Mac users, at least in this price range."
5,Vintage Van Vogt,"I think one might take another look at these van Vogt short stories. I took the advice of an internet site on van Vogt and found these stories to be a fine vintage. They have the strange, hallucinatory power of his best work.Destination Universe (1952)Another strong collection from his best years. Notably:""Far Centaurus"" (1944) A vivid, almost hallucinatory tale of suspended animation on a starshipvoyage.""The Monster"" (1948) A fine tale of a far future Earth invaded by alienmonsters who evoke specters from the long departed human race.""Dormant"" (1948) The U.S. Navy unwittingly wakes up an alien monster.""The Enchanted Village"" (1950) An ironic Martian adventure of the first man on Mars.""The Search"" (1943) A mystery solved by effortless dream-logic. There isa hallucinatory quality to this tale which defies description.It also contains the stories: A Can of Paint, Defense, The Rulers, ""Dear Pen Pal"" and The Sound."
5,Excellent as the anime!,"Although the anime is a bit weird and so is the music, once you get to see and hear it, you get hooked! I loved the type of music because it's SO different from the normal ""j-pop"" songs in animes that makes it even better! It is a must buy for any fan, because you won't regret it. ^.~"
3,The Usual Ramsey Lewis,"I like Ramsey Lewis but no surprise in this CD. It seems that Ramsey includes a few big hits on a CD with other songs that go off the deep end. In my personal opinion, if it were not for ""Julia,"" ""Les Fleurs,"" and ""Goddess 2000,"" the CD would be a flop. But if you like Ramsey and his diversions, then this CD will not disappoint."
1,"For research only (I'd give it ""No Star"" if I could...)","I'm researching various productions of PIRATES, and you reallydon't want to see this one unless, like me, you have to. It has allthe signs of a bad BBC job--lip sych sound with the wrong audio ambience, over-the-hill juveniles without charm, and performers giving about 45% effort. END"
1,Unwatchable!,"I was tempted to throw tomatoes at my own television screen during this awful production of a great opera! The singing is mediocre, the acting is horrid, and the sets remind one of a bad high school production. My friends and I -- all of us long time fans of Gilbert and Sullivan's humor and style -- couldn't even finish watching this dreadful production. We also tried to watch this series's production of Ruddigore, but we found that to be just as bad. Run, don't walk, from this truly abyssmal series!"
2,Nothing Special,"If you like Gilbert & Sullivan and are also a fan of under-rehearsed lip-syncing, than this tame production could be for you. Fans of Peter Allen might be disappointed, however, as he doesn't really cut loose, and given the wholesale overacting of the rest of the cast (particularly Keith Michell) you might not notice if he did. I'm not a G&S fanatic, but this seems to be reasonably well sung by the chorus and ingénues. (Though that word is used advisedly as the actor playing Frederick looks pretty long in the tooth to be playing a twenty-one year old, rendering all the jokes about his and Ruth being mis-matched pretty pointless.)"
1,Worst Pirates I have ever seen-inc grade school productions,"I love Peter Allen. I already owned several versions of Pirates (including the fantastic version with Kevin Kline and Linda Ronstadt. This was awful. I could not finish watching. Remember, I love Peter Allen. If you do also, do yourself a favor ... don't buy this."
2,Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Michell,This operetta was pulled together. Medium quality. Better ones are out there. The most interesting part was how the setting was done.
1,Pirates of Penzance DVD; a PBS & BBC series,"The DVD came in a smashed case; the movie itself had annoying lines running throughout the movie. Also, it did not contain the famous marching pirates dance number (through the formal English garden). Very disappointing production!"
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!,This printer will cost you more in ink cartridges than it is worth. The cartridge ($50.00) that holds the ink tanks go out every few tanks of ink. Canon claims these will last for 20 tanks. Not true. I have bought 2 cartridges that have only lasted for 3 tanks each. The tech support is worthless.
2,Good for everything but color.,"I bought this printer under the impression it was good for printing pictures. Boy was I wrong!! B&W quality is fine, but color comes out horrible!!!"
2,ok but not worth the money,"i have had this printer for almost 3 years and have not been happy. The color is not very good at all, It is extremly loud, and shakes so bad it rocks my hole desk!! Not good at all if you want to print pictures unless they are really tiny( bad resolution) the cannon site is hard to find support and when you do there is no infomation that helps which means you have to call tech supprt and you know what fun that can be!! Which i did and after staying on hold for a hour they hung up on me!!Get an epson. comparable prices for better quality...that is what i did and am glad i did it!!"
2,It prints... but it could be better,"The main drawback of this printer is Canon's design for getting ink to the print head. Because the ink has to seep through a sponge to get to the print head, the amount of ink flow is limited. For instance, if you were to print something that had, say, heavy black in one area, it would print okay for the first few lines, but much more than that and it'll start leaving blank streaks across your paper where there wasn't enough ink to feed the print head... effectively ruining your print. Also, it seems that the print heads get dirty quickly, as I have to run the print head cleaning program about once every two weeks."
3,For newies only,"This book is arranged as a dictionary of lesbian sex topics. While it does have everything from A-Z, I personally believe this is for newies or those interested in the lesbian culture. For those of us that are already submerged into the culture and have been ""full members,"" this book simply does not offer anything additional for us to learn from."
1,Lesbianism For Dummies?,"This book is fairly useless, unless you have no idea what a lesbian is and you don't have the internet. More than anything, it's a very basic dictionary of (mostly vaguely) related lesbian terms. This is not a how-to guide, and it will probably not benefit anyone who is currently in a relationship. Not recommended."
1,"Updated, but not very good","It's good the author updated her book, which was pretty old ...( It came out before I was even legal!), but I don't think it's very good. So it's one of those A to Z books. Tells you about everything, but not how to do it."
5,A must-read for anyone interested in the topic,"I had resisted buying this book for some time because I felt that I was well acquainted with the subject matter already. I was, however, suprised at how much I learned from the Lesbian Sex Book. Every appropriate topic is covered in a concise, succinct manner and the writing is exceptionally clear and direct. I have recommended this book to my Lesbian friends and they have found it as useful and informative as I have."
2,Very Simplistic,This book was very disappointing. I found it to be very simplistic and dull. It only covers the basics. This would be a good guide for someone that has absolutly no idea what lesbianism is or how two women could be intimate. I feel as if the obvious was overstated and that readers would be better off looking else where if they are wanting a book with a little bit of flavor and variety.
3,I've read better,"This book is a great overview. It's abc-organization is strange, but it works. I knew more about lesbian sex as a teen than I learned from this book. There's no new info in it. There are definitely better books out there. For detail, instruction, humor, and straight-forward girl-on-girl talk, buy ""The Whole Lesbian Sex Book"" instead. If you like things a little naughtier, get the ""On Our Backs Guide to Sex"". Have fun!!!"
5,Good condition,This book was cheaper than what my schools bookstore was asking for and it's in just as good of a condition.
5,I like this book a LOT,Purchased this book for my Interpreter Training Program (ITP). This book helped me to pass my NIC-Generalist Written Test. Would definitely recommend this book!
4,Great Journey,"If someone is interested in the Deaf World, this is the book to start with. It's comprehensively written with deep insights into the Deaf World. There are many misconceptions about the Deaf and their Culture in our society, and this book tries to clear the confusion. It can get a little long winded, but I urge anyone to push through these few parts. The journey is worth every word. What surprised me most was the fact that there actually was a push to eradicate the Deaf Culture and Deaf people in general, and not so long ago. It's an eye-opening journey; a journey worth taking."
3,Deaf Culture,"This book is packed full of information. Can be a bit overwhelming and boring at times. Chapters are long. I feel much of what is said is very interesting and informative, but could have been said in a more concise manner."
3,Required for school,"Not a bad book, but if it weren't required for school, wouldn't have bought it. Although, not too bad of a read. :)"
3,North to Alaska,"North to Alaska in this pulp. A mystery ensues when FBI agent Bill Norton arrives in Ketchikan to track down his former boss who has disappeared into thin air. Accidental drownings, an heiress to a halibut trade, and a radio station owner's death all marinate to make this a fishy stew of a story. One has to remember this is a pulp, not a highly researched novel and in its favor, it has bones."
5,Very practical and helpful,"This book, while concentrating on landscape photography, can be used as an intro guide for all kinds of digital work. Easy to use format allows you to work through a project while introducing you to techniques you can then explore further on your own. I've recommended it to several people, including a couple of very experienced film photographers, and everyone has found it to be a good resource.Note that this book doesn't explain PhotoShop or other photo editing programs, though it incorporates them, but is organized by project or function that the photographer wants to accomplish. If you want a tutorial on photo-editing programs, this book will not meet this purpose. I do think the book is very accessible to beginners, and that it has something to offer to all digital photographers. I believe the clarity of the writing and the step by step format of the book make this possible."
4,Never played the Video game,I watched part of the Movie in a hotel and decide it was good enough to watch the whole movie so I bought it. Good action and story was not great but not as bad as some movies I have seen. And movies based on video ganes are usually bad. but I can live with this one. R rated which was good for me. I hate pg-13
5,Movie is awesome,This movie rocks!!!! and its in Blu-ray what else can you ask for. Recommend to anyone that likes action movies.
4,Good shoot'em up..,I already rented this on dvd and just had to buy it on BluRay..I really like action movies and shoot'em ups..
4,Great Escapist Film,"Considering its origins, the plot and texture of ""Hitman"" are well-formed and strong. Timothy Olyphant, Olga Kurylenko and Dougray Scott handle their respective roles perfectly, and the pace of the action is excellent. While an action-adventure film, it also examines personal issues of self-examination among the characters.My only question is, why does Amazon not list these actors in the header information for this video?"
4,For the gamers,"If you loved the game you'll enjoy the movie, it got all the great stuff from the game in it and many scenes feel like home. However if you didn't like the game or never even heard of the game, this movie is just another action movie with a vague plot.For me it was like visiting an old friend."
2,Nothing to see here..move on.,"Poor acting and stupid dialogue. This one was a real stinker. I laughed out loud when the cop told him ""Don't do anything stupid"" and then handcuffed him with his hands in front. Cliche after cliche. Must have been written for Jason Statham but I guess he was too busy to do the movie."
3,Much Better Than I Heard,"I had heard a lot of bad things and bad reviews about this movie. I was suprised when I watched it that it was as good as it was. I thought Timothy Olyphant did a good job and that the girl who played his love interest was also good and HOT. The guy that plays T-Bag on the TV show Prison Break was also good. I have never played this game but I thought the story was pretty solid. It kind of reminded me of The Bourne Identity as he is a trained super assassin from a place that churns them out and he has flash backs of good and bad things.Anyway, the action rocked and it was exciting and entertaining beginning to end. It was pretty good and fun to watch."
4,Good Action Movie,"I'm not familiar with the game, but the movie was a pretty good action flick. Didn't have any higher expectations and it filled the bill."
3,Hitman,"I thought it was a great movie I liked the story line and the action that came with it. The acting was at times a bit over played, enjoyed the unedited version. If someone want a great action movie and a good story line this is a good movie to watch."
1,Not even close,OK I'm a huge fan of the Hitman games and I thought hey it has a great story all the games have great scripts and great action but i was surely disappointed. I have major gripes with this movie not only does Timothy Olyphant not even closely resemble agent 47 but his acting pukes all over a great games serious and who ever wrote the script needs to be punched in the face none of the action would even closely resemble what agent 47 does in any of the games if you want your hitman fix from a source other then the games i strongly suggest the book (Hitman:enemy within) it a great book on its own even if you know nothing of the Hitman series of games it one hell of a read and if you love the games as i do you'll need the book trust me get the book not the movie
1,rip off of the Marvel's The Punisher.....Stupid,"This was a stupid movie. A rip off of the Punisher, Nothing else.No acting, no script, and no point."
1,Disappointing,"Disappointing thriller about a no-name hitman. Stars Timothy Olyphant who is so amazing in 'Deadwood', but can't cut it here. Maybe if it were Clive Owen or Jason Statham as the lead it would have helped. Turned it off about an hour into it."
1,it's cheaper to set your head on fire,"With the rental price at $2.99 and gas at $2.69 a gallon, if you simply opt for the gallon of gas, you can save yourself the horror of watching this crapfest."
2,HERE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE,ITS A GOOD MOVIE THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF THE FILM IS FOOTAGE FROM THE TV SHOW DARK ANGEL MAYBE A LOT OF YOU GUYS DONT REMEMBER BUT MAX (PLAYED BY JESSICA ABLA) WAS IN A PLACE JUST LIKE THIS AND THEY EVEN HAD THE BARCODE AT THE BACK OF THEIR HEAD .. I WOULDNT HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THEY JUST RESHOT EVERYTHING BUT THEY DIDN THEY USED THE SAME FOOTAGE DOWN TO THE SAME GIRL WHO WAS YOUNG MAX I JUST THINK IF YOU GOING TO SHOW SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE ELSE AT LEST REFILM IT AND OR GIVE CREDIT NO WHERE IN THE FILM DO I SEE THAT THEY GAVE CREDIT FOR USEING THE FOOTAGE.
4,love the game and like the movie,i love the game but not so much the movie. i do want to see a hitman 2 movie but more like the games story line.the problem with the movie it more then less like if your making a movie when your still in school to make movies. the things they need to change is tell who the guy is. i play the game so i knew who agent 47 was but the people around me look to me to give them inside info from them not knowing who he is. SO IF YOU PLAY THE GAME AND WATCHING THE MOVIE WITH SOMEONE WHO HASNT THEN THEY WILL ASK YOU A LOT OF THINGS.but if they do make another movie then they need to show more of who he is and make it realy close to the story line in the game but make it work for the movies.OVER ALLi would rent this movie even if you play the game.
1,"Good game, bad movie (unexpected!)","The character Codename 47 was suprisingly deep in the game (at least surprising regarding video games today), with extra points for lack of emotion and being cloned (unlike the movie). The love interest was a stupid addition and detracted from potential uniqueness of the movie, reducing it to formula.I played every one of the games, good and bad, and I can say for certain that I'm not a fanboi but that this movie completely missed the boat. Even worse than the Max Payne movie, which is surprising."
2,it was...meh,"This movie actually looked like a video game movie. You know how they usually have that sorta cheap, sorta cheesy look? This movie had that. I found the Hitman character totally uninteresting. The storyline was boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over."
1,worst action movie ever made.,"Yes, I know it's an action movie, not an Ingmar Bergman film. That being said, there was no way I could have known just how bad this movie was. This was ""Plan 9 from Outer space"" for action flicks. Timothy Olyphant's acting makes Keanu Reeves look like Anthony Hopkins and the writing is so bad that I couldn't decide which was worse, the embarrassingly terrible dialog or the cheesy and sophomoric 'action' scenes. It was as if a 14 year old boy wrote it for a remedial English class. And got an F. The only way I would watch this again is if I were stuck on a spaceship in deep space with two sarcastic robots."
1,Total primitive,"There are countless errors in the movie related to portraying the Russians. These errors are evident for everybody who knows Russian language and basics about Russian military. I'm not even talking about spoken Russian language in the movie, which could be OK for the English-speakers only. The uniforms, inscriptions, places, etc. are all wrong. Could one imagine an action movie with CIA agents where the letter ""C"" will be reversed like the Russian letter ""S"" on the backs of FSB agents? From mine point of view, the movie is a comedy rather than an action or a triller."
4,Never played the game....but loved the movie. My Mother loved it..nuff said.,"Good thing i bought the unrated version when it was 10.99. The movie is very good. Great scenery, good action and a beautiful girl. My mom liked the plot and the guy who played agent 47. Who is Timothy Olyphant?...she asked, never heard of him but his performance in this movie was great. We also liked the strange relationship with the Girl. I never played the game, but this is a very good movie. The unrated has more blood, particularly a missing arm and an ear. Enjoy it, it is worth it. Mom wants to know if there will be a sequel. We can only hope...."
5,Great for a used product,"I don't normally purchase items that are used, but I have to admit, in this case, a blu ray dvd coming from this company was in excellent shape. They take care of their products and got it to me in quick time."
3,Very meh,"This is nothing like the games in any form or fashion. I urge you not watch this movie as a fan of the games, but as a seeker of generic action. The sushi-poisoning, car-bombing 47 I know and love is too cool for all that athleticism and action. Also, he was made in a lab, never having been a child. But I digress... The movie was entertaining enough to finish, though I can't imagine ever watching it again. I suggest Dexter instead."
4,Light Action,"A decent film for light action, a bit gritty, not too polished. Enjoyed the version on disk more than on the tv."
4,Worth watching,"OK, so the plot is a little sparse and the acting is pretty poor, but it's made up for by great action. Overall, I found this movie entertaining enough. I think you definitely need to be familiar with the video game and the background story or you might be super confused. Either way, Timothy Olyphant is hot as a bald killer who is surprisingly human."
2,Hitman with footage from Dark Angel?,"Has anyone else noticed that Hitman has some of the exact footage of the flashback scenes of Dark Angel with Jessica Alba? Otherwise, this movie is watchable. Crappy but not the worst movie you'll ever see."
3,Better Than Expected,"5 stars? No. 3 stars are much more realistic. This movie wasn't half bad. There were some parts that were a bit cliche and flat, but the lead character was a strong one and the international supporting cast was decent. The background music fit and the foreign scenery was interesting too! Overall, I'd say this was worth renting for a Saturday afternoon of mindless, violent, action-movie fun. I wouldn't buy this for any more than $7 bucks, though...Enjoy. :)"
3,Almost saves itself,"What a crappy movie! No reedeming factors save Olyphant's character. Repetitive scenes, a joke of a story line and forgettable supporting actors. Rent it and forget it if you must, otherwise give this a miss."
3,hit man not quite Jason Bourne,"the plot is ok and the action is fine. Be sure to check out the alternate endings. Because the plot is sort of a Jason Bourne story, the comparison makes this not on the same level of intensity. In the end you just don't care about what happens to him compared to the Bourne stories."
5,Hitman,"Loved this movie. It had it all. Lots of action, great looking people and good acting. Timothy Olyphant is hot, hot, hot. Again, loved it."
5,"Well-done, mindless action.","I've played a few video games in my time, but never this one. I knew nothing about it going in, so I cannot speak to whether or not the movie is true to the storyline of the game. What I can tell you is that the movie was light on dialogue and heavy on the action. And I really liked it.Timothy Olyphant seemed relatively awkward cast as the lead, but the more I think about it, the more intentional that must have been. The movie's protagonist, Agent 47, was bred only to kill. Had he been more charismatic, it would have been less...for lack of a better term...believable. But that does not mean the movie lacks good action-movie one liners.I will freely admit that this movie carried little appeal beyond ""mindless shoot 'em up,"" but I like that type of movie, and Hitman was one of the better movies like that to come along recently."
4,Hit Man is a Hit,"I was unaware of the game Hit Man so I didn't watch the movie with expectations or baggage linked to the game. I really identified with Timothy Olyphant's character ""47"". His focused and unyielding pursuit of his target is heroic in technique and execution. 47's ability to acknowledge yet evade the seduction of female interest Nika Boronina, played by Olga Kurylenko, was a pleasant twist on the typical plot and aided in the development and understanding of the no compromise mind set of the character. His proactive and offensive use of automatic weapons is admirable while his political understanding of covert missions allows him to effectively interface with Interpol and Moscow CIA field agents to his advantage. If there ever was a Hollywood covert affairs field agent training model this would be it."
4,Good mindless fun,"Sometimes it helps to go in with low expectations. My wife and I are huge fans of Timothy Olyphant from Deadwood so we decided to give Hitman a chance even with the bad reviews. While it won't win any awards at this year's ""let's praise ourselves"" meetings, it's actually a pretty decent watch for a rental. Timothy O is a good actor and pulls off the role well. If you played the Hitman game, you will see a few nods to it in the movie. The plot is decent - it's not terribly tight but it is watchable. His female costar is an attractive Russian chick and you see her nude a few times - that only helps this type of movie.Even though there were reports of some of the violence being cut, it was still pretty bloody and the unrated edition includes even more fun! It holds up well over multiple viewings, which earns it 4 stars instead of 3."
4,I saw a definite difference in video quality between this and DVD,"We're slowly moving along to Blu Ray, replacing DVD's when the price is right and during one lightning deal the price was right for Hitman. I'm not going to waste your time about the story, or tell you that there were ""X"" number of sharper pixels, but merely to say I saw a difference (a good difference) in the video quality between this Blu Ray and the DVD (sometimes, with some movies, it's hard to say the difference justified the purchase, but in this case I would say it did)."
4,very good in spite of the fact that it is nonsensical in parts,very entertaining and visually impressive. some parts are nonsensical but do not detract from enjoyment of the movie as a whole. i would venture that the beginning and the middle are better than the end of the movie.
4,"It's a Hit, Man","The Good Things*Plenty of action and violence throughout. Some impressive fight scenes.*Good filming style; very solid.*Lots of cool gadgets and weapons.*Interesting group of characters. The main character is quite nifty.*Plotline is engaging.*Cool music.The Bad Things*Some of it does feel like you're watching a computer game.*Not for the squeamish (bloody violence and pervasive sex scenes).This is what you get if James Bond had less humor, more violence, and more grittiness. It is a very nifty action movie with cool fights and an exciting story (not to mention that it takes place in Russia). It's nothing too deep, but it entertains.The single-disc version has the movie, deleted scenes, and the gag reel. The two-disc version has all of that plus featurettes (all on disc one, though. Disc two only has the digital copy)."
4,"Good movie, alright special features","Plenty of people have reviewed the movie, so I'm going to focus of the special features. The deleted scenes and alternate ending leave plenty to be desired, the demos of the guns is really cool, except they dont do his huge sniper that he uses at the end. There is a pretty cool documentary about going from the game to the movie, and the gag reel is actually a lot better than I thought it would be. So overall, not bad. And as a fan of the game, I loved the movie!"
3,Entertaining movie,"Movie is well directed with fast-paced action sequences. The Blu-Ray version is average, I thought there would be more features in the two-disc set. The plot, well, it is based off a video game but in that context it is one of the better games-to-cinema movies produced. Acting is also average though Tim Olyphant tries his best with the script he is given."
4,Hitman,A real shoot em up. Not for the squeamish as there are plenty of blood highlights. Action packed and loaded. Not for kids.
3,mindless entertainment,"Suspended disbelief is required. Premise that a skinhead dressed in like a MIB and sporting a bar code tat on the back of his head slipping across borders while remaining anonymous is silly. Fun to watch but not to take to seriously.Fans of the Hong Kong gangster genre will recognize this as a knock off of John Woo & Chow Yun-fat plots. For instance there are elements of ""A Better Tomorrow"". The shootout scenes are derivative of Chow except Chow has grace and panache which is lacking here.Olyphant's dead pan delivery doesn't work well. It's like a 17 year old geek trying to sound like the Terminator."
4,Jason Bourne Clone Well... Sort Of,"This is a good movie for a video game adaptation, it really is not bad like many purists that play the game would make you believe. Timothy Olyphant is a very convincing Agent 47 and the action is really good very Jason Bourne in the ccombat sequences. Not having a name and having flash backs is also Bourneish. The whole ""I'm going to get the people that are trying to frame me"" is very Bourne Supremacy but even with all the similarities they did a very good job making this film stand alone as far as Agent 47 being Hitman and not Jason Bourne totally. Good film not a five but a very solid 4.25."
3,"Homage to the Games, but Not Much More","After playing through a couple of the hitman games, I expected the movie to be something of a hit gone wrong type of story. While Timothy isn't my favorite actor, I don't think he is a bad one. However, for the role of 47 someone who from the games seems to be a cold blooded contract killer, I thought Timothy and the writers gave too much emotion to him. The movie's theme is about 47 questioning the morality of killing, which for someone who was supposedly trained from birth to kill and excelled at it, I thought was a little cheesy. Said another way, I expected something closer to Jason Bourne but devoid of emotion."
3,Another game to movie ruined.,"Ruined shouldn't have been included in my title. It wasn't a bad movie. Definately better than most game to movie transistions. Probably one of the better. It's just I, like most, want to see it done right. I want to see it done with style and grace. It's been done with comics to movies. Why is it so hard for games to movies. The actions was great. Story...ho hum. I would rent before I buy."
3,pretty average action movie,"even though i never played the game i decided to rent the movie cause it looked good. it was pretty average. the shootings were really cool and bloodier than i expected but the movie made no sense in a way. if you like action movies with a lot of guns and dont mind blood then check this out, its worth a watch but not one to add to the collection."
2,Hitman,I love Timothy Olyphant but this was one of the worse movies ever..I would not recommend buying it..Waste of money..
2,So Much Potential,"This COULD HAVE been a good movie. You have a decent game series which is plot driven, a great leading actor, a hot chick, guns, but somehow it all went terribly wrong. With the exception of maybe two good scenes in the movie the plot is boring and moves so slow its hard to watch.Olyphant is a good actor, but the problem with this movie is the writing. If they had even taken the plots from some of the popular games, that would have been good but the movie moves to slow and choppy to be salvaged. Its just plain bad."
3,it's ok,"The quality of the DVD is ok, considering its incredible low price. However, I couldn't play the DVD with any of the player-softwares in my PC at first(probably because the copy protect's too strict).So I had no choice but searched more powerful players on the internet, and made it K-lite finally, which cost me a great sum of time."
1,Digital Copy not working,"This review is about the feature not the film itself. I specifically bought this version because of the digital copy. Unfortunately I had to find out that this digital copy has an expiry date of March 10th, 2008. All attempts to copy it into iTunes failed, on OS X as well as Windows XP and Windows 7. I think they should either update the digital copy or specifically mention that this digital copy does not work anymore. Very disappointing."
4,A Real Spooky City!,"I had this book when it came out in '94 when I was 15 and it really freaked me out! Another review doubted the validity of the tales...but I actually attended clases at the Pittsburgh Playhouse and know quite a few people that experienced these real life stories first hand! That place is definatly haunted! Another tale about a flower shoppe I know to be real... a friend of mine knows the owners and she too has felt strange things! I felt the book really told the each story vividly and kept the creepiness like a warm body with personal experience quotes from interviewees and, at least for a Pittsburgher, the locations were too close to home!"
2,Mystery in McKees Rocks,"Guess what---the story about McKees Rocks involved my house. The author turned out to be a rather lousy writer, and got several details wrong. But with God as my witness, the story is substantially true. Can't say if the others in the book are true, but there was definitely SOMETHING going on wierd in my house for a while. All is quiet now---March 2005."
2,Lacking in depth,"These could be interesting stories if they were more fleshed out. Most of the stories are only 2-4 pages and simply contain a paranormal story told by one person with no supporting facts, evidence, back-up accounts, etc. Each story reads like a paper done for a high school assignment where the task was to interview a person you know about a paranormal experience and write a short paper."
1,HOAX IN PITTSBURGH,"This book is just a pure hoax, using people's stupidity to make them believe in anything! None of those stories are true (I personally visited and investigated 90% of those places and I haven't noticed the slightest ""paranormal"" thing). If you want to waste your money then buy this book."
4,A Seasonal Secret,"It was a great, easy read. I enjoyed it because it was seasonal and a quick escape from all the holiday happenings."
3,Tortoise and the hare,"3 1/2Instrumentation was starting to fall into place, though MP still had an album or so to go until the consistently great percussion would truly align with all that vibraphone goodness. While a few songs stumble in the ongoing process of rectifying that equation, FTVOG remains almost completely listenable and often compelling."
5,movie music of your life,I had been looking for a cd that was instrumental with a little singing that i could listen to then go to sleep to and the mercury program was what i was looking for. I was introduced to the cd by my guitar teacher he told that this was the wierdest thing he had heard. So i had to listen to it and it is the cd of 2000. One thing i like about how the music seems to flow into one big song and the vocals aren't screamed they are melodic and go with it very well. If you like easy listening music and movie background music i suggest the purchase of the this cd.
3,Doesn't like ice or frozen fruit!,"We bought this to make smoothies. If you don't use ice or frozen fruit, it works great! We even used crushed ice and it still stalled the blender. Didn't like frozen fruit, it got stuck and you'd have to open the lid and stir it. Got too frustrating so we returned it. Still looking for a replacement that doesn't cost $500!"
2,Not worth the money,"I received this blender last year for Christmas. It has not even been a year yet and it has already quit working. I agree with the previous review, it stalls if you use too much ice (regular or crushed) and does not work with frozen fruit. I was mixing a smoothing with both ice and frozen fruit and it just quit working. I'm so disappointed. I guess you don't always get the best value with higher priced items. I'll stick to Oyster, which I received when I got married 22 yrs ago and is STILL going strong!"
1,not favorable,This pool arrived with a hole in it. It is easily torn and very hard to keep clean. I do NOT recommend it.
4,A great value,The pool sets up easily and drains easily. It is also a breeze to clean. I purchased an inflatable pool last year and it was a complete waste of money. I ended up tossing it at the end of the summer. I can see keeping this pool for many years. My one suggestion- make sure it is on very level ground or the sides will collapse a bit. Overall a great value.
2,Too Easy,"I found these videos to be my least favorite. I started my exercise routine with her about 2 years ago and she helped me to achieve a 25 pound weight loss. I thought that I would get these to bump up my exercise routine and do something different, but I was really disappointed. The Walkblaster incline step does not really add anything to the workout, maybe if it went higher it might do some good. The videos just don't get your heart pumping like her others do..I love her other videos, but I wouldn't waste my money on these..."
1,This is only the DVD,I called Amazon after reading these reviews. Even though the step is pictured it is NOT in the package only a DVD. I think this page is confusing for customer's. The reviews and pictures imply you are getting the whole set but you are not. I canceled my order.
5,Fantastic Drawing Room Drama,"I'm surprised this film isn't currently in print because to me it's indispensible. Where to begin. If Oscars were given for ensembles the cast of ""Separate Tables"" would go to the front of the line. You can't debate the Oscars awarded David Niven and Wendy Hiller but the revelation to my mind is Rita Hayworth. It may be a case of diminished expectations but Hayworth punches holes in her glamour queen persona. The script has a keen understanding for the impulses of the human heart, it's loneliness and fears alike. Despite the film's stage origins Director Delbert Mann keeps the film from feeling stagy. Undisputed classic."
2,Where is the sound?,"I love this wonderful movie. ""Separate Tables"" is a very, very good movie, the acting in it is superb. But I am very displeased with the sound. On my DVD the sound is awful.Bert-Owe Ivland"
4,"""Big things come in small packages""","Excellent drama set in a seaside hotel which acts as a cruicible and window onto the human conflicts and frailties which lay beneath the surface of everday human lives. The movie excells in it's realism and depicition of integral human traits of love, jelousy, vanity and evil. Emotions and flaws which are as vivid and alive not only in wars, revolutions and mass upheavals, but also in the intertwining lives of all of us, including the inhabitants of this seemingly tranquil boarding house. Highly recommended. One of Burt Lancaster's best films."
2,Old stuff,Rita was too old already and the plot of the film is not very convincing anymore... Boring boring... Some good actors for sure but the plot is very naive for a modern audience...
1,Blahhh,"It's inconceivable the David Niven could receive any award for his overstated facials and rapidfire deliveries.This film remains rooted, buried, in its stageplay, and makes little attempt to explore cinemacraft other than a few unimaginative camera angles.Not even Pepper our dog nor Kodo our cat would sit through this disaster. We all missed the final shots that drew some raves."
5,A Great Adaptation of the Play!,"All the stars are at their absolute best in this adaptation of Terrence Rattigan's 1950's play. David Niven greatly deserved that Best Actor Oscar for playing a military man with a dark past, Burt Lancaster was terrific as a man who wanted to get back with his divorcee, yet having a relationship with a younger woman. A terrific flick!"
4,Loved Them....While They Lasted,"These were my go-to shoes for a night on the town, but eventually, the heel fell off, and they began to look a little ragged quickly. I would purchase them again, though!"
2,Khoi Dallas Tx,"Nice watch , but having trouble when i pull out the arm to make it stop and it still running .I am not happy the way it happen .I would not recommended buying this."
4,Excellent value for the money!,This 'bargain' purchase at $49.95 is an excellent value! Need I say more?
4,Sobering Look At Divorce and Remarriage,"None of the characters in this insightful novel of divorce and remarriage are likable. (Even small Tess is a bit of a simp.) Robinson has created a story where every character is selfish, myopic, and unsympathetic. Yes, human.Yet through these flawed characters, Robinson paints a disturbing and very accurate picture of the ravages of divorce, remarriage, step children, blended families and in-laws. Through her adept prose we navigate amid the tangle of recrimination, fault finding, self justification, betrayal, malice, and irony: divorce in today's society.This is a sobering book. The ending is too pat, too unlikely; but it is the only false step in an otherwise absorbing novel."
5,peace of shakti,"Beautiful album.a handful of beauty indeed......John at the absolute height of his powers..never quite reaching such a peak of creativity again ,great though a lot of his works areSaw Shakti perform this music in the '70's and for me was one of the most stunning performances ever!A Handful of Beauty?......most certainly.......so grab yourself a handful now before this gem disappears into the vaults at SonyDerek Pritchard"
3,"Roger Whittaker ""Live in Berlin""","I only rated this 3 stars because the artist sings mostly inthe German language and did not understand it. There are a few songsin English, but very few for my taste. The description was not clearwhen I ordered otherwise I would not have ordered thisdvd. It is not a total loss because I love Roger Whittaker andeven in a foregin language, he sounds great....just like tounderstand what I am listening to. Otherwise, the show is goodand it is a very upbeat dvd, but best if you understand."
5,The Rescue Of A Forgotten Classic,"An amazing lost work of African-American cinema. Filled with surreal and sensuous imagery, and a haunting performance by the late Duane Jones (Night Of The Living Dead), this may not be a film for everyone, but for the adventurous it will reward your time and patience. By virtue of rescuing this film from the obscurity in which its lived for so long, this DVD would rate 5 stars. But on top of a superb restoration and transfer, you also get an informative and impassioned commentary track, a gallery of beautiful stills, and a well-written analysis/history of the film. Taken together, this is a triumph of no small magnitude."
3,Better in theory...,"While this movie is termed ""legendary"", Ganja and Hess is one of those movies that are better in the ideas they present rather than the actual film. Ganja and Hess has its profound moments; it has incredibly intense and sensual imagery as well as a beautiful soundtrack but the plot is very unclear. I honestly don't blame others for wanting to edit the film because the actual storyline is hard to find beneath the dream sequences and the symbolism.Ganja and Hess is thought-provoking, but flawed. That's all there really is to say about it. I do recommend watching Abel Ferrara's film The Addiction as a companion piece to Ganja and Hess, which explores some of the same ideas."
2,Had heard about this for years...,"and finally just saw it in TCM. It made me really glad I never bought it. While the film does have some interesting experimental scenes and an interesting plot, it ultimately ends up being confusing, choppy, and unable to hold one's sustained interest. I can appreciate what the director was trying to do as well as his vision, but there's such a thing as overkill when it comes to being ""artistic-strange."" This film has overkill to spare."
2,Maybe u have to be high 2 like this,"Its an interesting time-capsule from the 1970's. The actors don't have grills or tatoos. But it is hard to make sense of what is going on, so stay away from this turkey."
3,"Strong on basics, not enough on broadband","If you want to interconnect all your computers and printers this book explains all the basics you will need. But if you want DSL there is not enough - in fact there's really nothing. It also does not explain any details about phone line complexities if you want to link your home computers over your phone lines, e.g. how to also use a modem or phone line DSL over the same system."
1,absolute garbage and lack of knowledge by author,"The author has made so many misqueues, there is no way that they were accidental. Gigabyte Ethernet? That's one heck of an Ethernet signal! I wish I had one of those. Win98 or ME can't be servers? Even in a workgroup? Bah! Don't waste your time here folks. Move along, there is nothing to see here."
2,Disappointing Shaver,"I had high expectations for this product based on all the great reviews. After using this product for a month I can't understand how these reviews came about.Firstly, I am disappointed at the build quality of this product. The silver paintwork is already peeling off. I thought considering the cost of this product that it was made of metal. The silver panels along the side are silver painted plastic.Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face. The worst part of the shave being around the neck.The ""Powercomb"" technology does absolutely nothing.The cost of this product does not equate to quality and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product."
2,Ouch - this thing bites,"Good shave but be careful - it cut me twice. It has two foil heads and flat part between them that is supposed to cut long hairs. I twice got cut by this. Braun was great about sending my $$ back. I'm back to norelco. I think it shaves better than Norelco but if I want to cut myself, I'll use a blade."
3,doesn't live up to the reviews,I had a Braun 4775 and I thought it took a long time to get a smooth shave with it so after seeing several good reviews for the Braun 8975 I ordered it and tried it for a week. It doesn't shave as well as the Braun 4775. So I sent it back and got a refund.
5,Excellent,"I have tried several shavers over the years, but keeping going back to Braun. I tried the less expensive versions, but this version is well worth the cost."
3,Maybe I expected too much...,"To be honest, I expected a closer shave. I switched from a razor to the Braun, but a razor provides a much better shave. If you don't shave every day, you will have problems cutting the longer hairs. I also didn't expect to have to go over the same area of my face numerous times in order to get a decent shave. However, the shaver is well made and does have an excellent battery life."
2,Disappointed,"I've been shaving electric since 1936!I have a light beard. My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately. I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer. I bought a Braun 8975 recently so I could leave it at my vacation house. It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.After 2 months I'm disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......I get 5 shaves only before I have to recharge and I've discharged it completely twice already.Also, it does not cut any closer than my 5520 which incidentally gives me about two weeks of shaving before I must recharge it. I'm sorry I got the 8975. It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment. The case isn't very substantial either and it's very noisy."
4,review of braun razor,Braun has always made a quality razor and this one is another example of their quality products
1,Sucks!,"After 3 or 4 previous Braun models, this is the WORST model I've owned. The plastic is very cheap, the mechanical actions are not smooth or refined. I'm very disappointed... Gillette, you're ruining the brand!"
3,Braun 8975 Shaver - not as close as a blade,"This is a quality product and I use it from time to time; however, it just doesn't shave as close as a blade. I frequently find myself ""re-shaving"" with a blade after using this shaver. I'm not sure any electric shaver will shave as close as a blade as long as there is that foil between the blades and your face."
1,On my husband's behalf,"We have NEVER wrote a review but this shaver was so bad I wanted to hopefully save someone else some time and money & pain. He is not a person to complain or write reviews. So on his behalf here goes. Our daughter bought this Christmas of 2007. Not quite a year old. It has two major problems. Short and simple. For one, it yanks his hair out. He could always wax. Same pain but not an option for a man. Last but NOT least...it's very loud. He closes the bathroom door, turns the shower on and it's still loud. He is not new to electric shavers so yes he has tried to fix the problem. Not what you would expect for the money and less than a year old. Well, there is always this Christmas."
1,Worst Braun ever bought,"I have been using Braun razors from my teens.( I was raised in Germany and Braun was the best razor there.) About 10 years ago I bought a rotary blade razor from Norelco and was surprised how well and close the shave was! A year ago it was time to get a replacement. After doing all the ratings research on the web, I went back to Braun. What a mistake! Its ""new technology"" twitches the skin. Its shave is not as close as the Norelco was, the top easily dsengages. All in all, I am ready to junkt it!"
2,Average at best,This is my first Braun razor. It does an average job at best. I constantly need to use a bic razor to trim my neck where the Braun will not cut hair closely. I'll purchase a different less expensive brand next time.
5,Closest shave I've ever had from an electric,I've been using the 8975 for about 6 weeks now and I am very pleased with my purchase.This unit does offer a much closer shave against my face than my Norelco 3 head unit ever did. I shaved for 5 weeks before I ran the charge down to less than 25%.The negatives are slight.I've had a little problem with cutting around my adams apple. I use the trimmer for that now. Also the head doesn't collect too much stubble debris so you have to clean often or it will trickle out while you are shaving.I'm very satisfied with my purchase and this is a razor I'd recommend to anyone.
3,Braun electric shaver,"The shaver is fine and works as advertised. After using a razor blade for years, the electric shaver leaves something to be desired. It doesn't shave as close, but then, I suppose no electric shaver does."
4,"Excellent shave, although a little slow","For the past ten years, I used a Norelco rotary shaver. It finally died on me, and based on the good reviews here and in Consumer Reports, I went for this razor. Consistent with the reviews, it does provide an excellent shave in that my skin is very smooth afterwards. On the negative side though, it takes a lot long to get to that point than it did with my older rotary shaver. I have to run the shave over a given spot many times in many different directions. Also, they could have used some type of vibration damping (rubber over-mold) to lessen the vibrations in your hand. After a while, it tends to make the hand feel strange. All in all, it's still a great razor. It just takes 10 minutes as opposed to 5 minutes, and your hand vibrates a little. I do love the fact that it has Ni-MH batteries as opposed to Ni-Cd. Better for the environment and they won't die on you two years into the life of the razor"
3,Good but not great,It takes about a week to adjust to your skin. It is really good and shaves real close at most places on your face. The neck is the problem! I always find strand hair and have to shave with my Mach3 as well!
2,Would not recommend,I didn't even realize the book had completed. I was waiting for another chapter. Maybe about a round where the author had a chance to actually break eighty or maybe did break eigthy. At one point on side 4 I thought I was getting a repeat of side 3. Was not satisfied with this book.
1,Waste of time!,"Intriguing title fooled me into reading this one! I was not impressed with much of anything in this book. Although many of us can relate to the drive to achieve golf levels, this book doesn't offer much. Found the author to be irrelevant to my approach to the game. Too critical of teacher, course, most of everything except himself. As one PGA pro said: ""complain about everything except the one swinging the club."" This would make a much better title. Try Carl Paulson's book to see a magnificent player struggle with the game."
1,Useless !!!,"I feel cheated. The ""blurb"" I read about this audiobook suggested it would prescribe remedies for ""Breaking Eighty"". All this book does is depressingly stress that most people will NEVER break Eighty , no matter how much time, effort, money , blood ,sweat and tears they expend. It's totally useless...nothing more than a hacker's journey through hacking. ..Not one iota of relevance to the task at hand. Do NOT , under any circumstances , pay money for this...regardless of format.Also... The author's delivery is akin to those ghastly overwritten and adenoidal essays that infest NPR daily.Have I made myself clear ???"
4,"Good, but not excellent","I had expected more court-yard gardens (being in Spain) and more historical gardens. What we are presented are more modern gardens (mostly) at villas and mansions in the country. And they didn't always live upp to my expectations. If you compare to France, gardens in Spain doesn't seem to have that high standard in design. I thought there would have been enough for a book this size to rival the French but no. Although some photos are stunning, this will not be a favourit in my humble collection."
1,Checkerboard game,"This would have been a great toy, but it only came with one red set of checkers. Not much fun if you ask me!"
2,"Board is nice, checkers are cheaper than cheap.","The woodenesque board is perfect - no folds, lays flat. However the checkers themselves are very thin & cheap. I will look for better checkers to replace them."
2,Low Quality,"I definitely don't recommend this set. It's cheap in every respect: flimsy box, light weight pieces. They brag the that the board doesn't fold but this makes it harder to store. Pay more and get more."
3,"3 and 1/2 stars for game, 4 and 1/2 for seller","The game arrived quickly and it was intact. The checkerboard and pieces are in great shape. But the box is large, which makes it difficult to store in my closet. Also, it's flimsy. Already one corner of it was crushed in transit. Not really the fault of the seller. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."
1,Not What I Expected,"Expected a red/black board. Received a brown/black flimsy cardboard board with small, thin checkers. Not a good purchase even at yard sale price."
1,"Cheap, flimsy","I don't recommend this product unless you want to spend your money on a cheap, flimsy game. I gave it to my granddaughter as a Christmas present but then purchased another Checker game for her after Christmas that was nicer and sturdier with better made pieces."
4,Great for the price.,"The checkers set is great for the price. So when checker pieces are lost or one of the dogs chews up the corners, then I'm not out a ton of money and can buy another one!Keep in mind that the checkerboard does not fold in half..."
2,Not the best Animal Ark Book,"I have read quite a few Animal Ark books,but this one was different. The text was a bit awkward and Mandy and James spoke and thought differently then they usually do. I liked it a little,but only beacause I love horses and riding,(I own my own pony and know quite a bit about horses). I also think that two children could NOT tame a wild pony by themselves. It might give children insane notions that they can tame a wild horse by themself. If you read a lot of Animal Ark books or know about horses,you'll see why I only gave this book two stars."
3,One of the most interesting books I&#65533;ve Read.,"The story is about a family of vets, the Hope family, going on vacation with a friend named James. They are in Ireland and the kids Mandy and James are on the beach when they spot footprints , horse hoof prints . They follow the hoof prints until they find a herd and in the herd they spot a foal with a halter that's cutting deeply into her skin . They told Mandy's parents what they saw and they tried a couple times to get the halter off of the poor foal but they didn't succeed till they met a boy named Sean Malone . You'll have to read the rest of the story to see what happens to the weak little foal ."
5,wow what a great book!,this is a great book! you realy should read it! though i don't like sean he seamed to be taking mandy away from james. but overall this is a great book!i highly recomened it! i love the ponies!
2,Too Many New Words Distracting From the Plot,"6/30/03 Have listened to a young relative reading the book allowed..she picked it for the illustration on the jacket.I have seen the Animal Ark(one which is re many animals(I purchased it in fact a year ago for a neice doing research on Pandas).This book has so many seldom used words,so many uses of words as literary language(e.g. the ponies churning the sand)..."
4,James Herriot's Yorkshire,"This book was purchased for my cousin who happens to have a small ranch. They have horses, chickens, lambs, cats, dogs and wild geese and herons. My cousin is an avid reader but had never heard of The James Herriot's series.I read it many years ago and loved seeing where Herriot had worked and lived. A truly delightful reading."
4,Very good!,"This was purchased as a gift for someone who enjoys all of James Herriot's books. She was overwhelmed to receive Yorkshire in pictures, and has enjoyed the book very much."
3,Re-Print,"I had a copy of this book when it first was published. I loaned it to a friend who never returned it. Now, years later, I wanted another copy, which I subsequently received. However, I do not feel the quality of the book is as good as the first one. Binding seems cheaper, and paper quality seems diminished. Contents, however, are as I remember; and I am enjoying the beautiful photography and commentary by Mr. Herriot."
2,Entertaing,"Great book, it was a gift for my father, unfortunatly the pages started falling out it, if it came in a hard bound I would have preferred that better. That is why I gave it only 2 star, because of the quality of the binding."
1,Beware of bootlegs,"The true cd box set has a catalog number of VIZL-64. The one I purchased turned out to be from Alion, catalog number ALCA-8032/5. Some manufacturing flaws in the cd led me to do some looking into this.This box set, like much of Cowboy Bebop, has been out of print for some time now, and the existing box sets are somewhat of a collectors item, so beware of low priced items.The set I recieved has trouble being read by most of the cd and dvd drives I have, 'fortunately' one external drive can read them. I'd advise some digging around to be sure you're actually getting a box set from Victor Entertainment and not a bootleg if you are sensitive to such things.I've liked the music of Cowboy Bebop since I saw my first episode, and I saw this as a convenient way to get a fair portion of the soundtracks. The bootlegged versions of this product may not live up to your expectations of quality. Cowboy Bebop gets 5 stars. Bootlegs, well, can't go below 1, would if I could."
1,"it's past a month, haven't received yet","it's past a month, haven't received yeti left a message about it , haven't had answer about it"
5,3...2...1... let's jam,"Cowboy Bebop is simply one of the best television shows ever to grace the screen. The storyline is amazing, the art breathtaking, and the music ties it all together. I have seen the entire series and own 4 of 6 sessions on DVD, now I can experience the music and remember it all thanks to this box set. I can't help but smile as I remember Spike entering the church as I'm driving home in the rain listening to the guitar solo in the song ""rain"". I wouldn't recomend listening to the music before seeing the show, however, seeing as how you would be ruining a signifigant portion of the experience. If you have seen every session though, don't hesitate to pick up this amazing box set."
5,Can't stop dancing,"Music from cowboy bebop, what more can you ask for? All your favorites are on it, and the limited collectors box is pretty sweet, oh yeah it comes with a 60 page in Japanese of the character bios, which I lost years ago,"
2,"Bootleg copy, beware","This set comes in an old-style, hard-case 4-CD jewel box. The individual CDs (audio CDs) have the ""DVD Video"" logo on them, and while the whole thing appears to be a fairly high quality bootleg, it is non-the-less, a bootleg. I don't know if it was authorized, or if this is an outright abuse of copyright law, but I'd aim for the real thing if you can find it.Hopefully the original artist will re-issue the real thing...."
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,The version that I got is not the Japanese version!!! I thought the price of 40 bucks was too cheap and I was right. If you don't mind then just get it. If you want the orignal version make sure you check. As far as the music goes its great.
5,Bang.,"Wow! This is one of the best soundtracks ever made. Really The price tag my be a little high, but it's worth every penny! I'm a huge bebop fan and I have to say I tear up every time I hear Goodnight Julia / Space Lion. My girlfriend, who has never seen the show ( I'm working on it ) was just as amazed. I can't recomend this enough! Five stars isn't enough!"
5,Awsome music,Bought this set for my boyfriend for Christmas. Much better than I had ever imagined it would be. The creativity and style that comes thru is brilliant! Any music lover is sure to appreciate Yoko Kanno's music.
3,New versions not as good,"Some of the other reviewers are spot on. The thickness and durability of these file holders have decreased over the years and the new ones are marginal at best. If you take a box full of magazines down off the shelf without supporting it on the sides and bottom, it will come apart. Ok if you're storing magazines for very occasional use. Not so good for a working environment where the boxes are handled on a regular basis."
4,Simple product,This is pretty straight-forward product. Assembling the boxes was easy and it holds its shape. The faux wood look is a little cheesy and obviously cheap. I wish it were just a flat color. Price is great though.
2,I thought they were too flimsy...,I didn't care for these boxes as they do not stand up once they are filled with magazines. I expected a higher quality for the price.
3,Check the measurements,"I got these because they were a little cheaper than the blue Bankers Box magazine files*. It turns out they are also just a bit smaller. I have been filing papers, folders, and various magazines in the blue ones, and the folders don't fit in these. They are otherwise perfectly good. Check the size of the items you expect to file and compare to the product measurements. *Bankers Box Decorative Magazine Files, Cornflower Blue, Letter 6 Pack (6110101)"
4,The biggers size is better,"The bigger size is much more useful than the smaller size. I am sorting music books and they do not fit in the smaller size magazine holders by about 1/4 inch. The books fit just fine in the bigger ones. Note- These are not the strongest magazine holders, but they work for sorting and placing several next to each other on a shelf. After I had tried out both sizes, I ordered more of the bigger ones."
5,Great Product,"Very sturdy, easy to assemble, and does what it's supposed to do. I've even purchased an additional set after I ran out of room."
4,Bankers Box Magazine File,This is a good product if that is what you want. But it (12 items that could have been put into a large envelope)was shipped via UPS in three(3) large boxes? Please explain!
3,OK in an eclectic kind of way.,"First of all, I'll rate it for you: ""R"". They use the ""f"" word a lot. There's also about 30 seconds of partial frontal nudity ... which gets a PG-13 rating now-a-days ... during a love scene (though, they're not it love). For some reason, Blockbuster has this listed as ""Youth Restricted Product"". I guess that's their new term for ""R"". I dunno. It could be that they have phobias regarding adult conversation.The plot is OK. Each character has a weird nickname that distracts a little from what's going on. The writing is eclectic. The final scene seems to be written by another person altogether ... perhaps the screen writer was bi-polar ... but that just makes it fun, doesn't it?Anyway, this is a story about a woman who is afraid to make a commitment to a real relationship because it'll make her feel. But guess what happens...."
2,Should have included instructions for storage,I purchased this item for a Christmas gift for my husband. It was sent quickly and packaged well. It was in a container in a plastic bag. I stored it in my refrigerator and was shocked to see that it exploded. The plastic bag was full of black oily fish. I was very disappointed that directions were not enclosed on storage of this product. Customer service quickly refunded my purchase price but I was still stuck with a $14.00 delivery charge. Not too happy about that as I don't think it was my fault!
1,Chipped glasses and plates..BEWARE,"This dishwasher chips the top of a of glasses and dishes. I have had dishwashers before and have never had this problem. When you bring up the problem, they ask you if you know how to load a dishwasher! As everyone knows that you turn over the glasses when they are being loaded and they are in a row (so they can't tip over), the next excuse from Paykal is that the glasses are tipping over. If that was the case the glasses would be chipped on the sides not the lips! I have never had such a, ""I don't give a care attitude from any company. If you like problems, buy a Paykal!"
2,Not Ready For Prime Time,"I installed this camera several times following the instructions to the letter. Using the Camera Control, it will only rotate about 50 degrees instead of 180 degrees and only tilt about 35 degrees. It I click on the demo button it will rotate the full 180 degrees and vertical tilt of the full 60 degrees. In addition, the Home button works fine. I have read everything on Logitech's web site and found other people complaining too but no answers.I returned my camera for a full refund after the response from Logitech was ""If you determine that your device is no longer functioning correctly, the fastest form of exchange is through the point of purchase (POP). Most resellers will offer an exchange or refund option for a limited time. Please contact the POP for available exchange options.""They did not acknowledge that they have a problem, so I will look elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your time,"My three year old Intel camera has a much better picture than this thing, MUCH. Even if they included better software, like an activeX plugin so it could be controlled from a web page, or a webcam server package, anything!, I would still return it because of the poor image quallity. I didb't even try the face tracking as what use would it be it the picture quality was worse than my old camera. Construction is good with an 9"" extention pole and a long USB cable. Software install was buggy at best.Save your money for a real pan tilt or buy a higher res one for the same price."
4,Happy with it so far.,"I've had this webcam running for a few days now. I'm actually quite happy with it - I wanted a motorized webcam that I could remotely move via remote-PC management (I'll be setting it up as part of a HTPC on the parent's TV and I wanted to be able to remotely manage the frame centering while I'm in another city when we do our videochats). Sure, the motorized movements of the camera when controlled via the desktop aren't that smooth, but it was actually smoother than I expected. It also makes minimal noise when it moves which is nice. The photo quality is pretty good and is on par with the Quickcam 4000 that I also have. Price is a little steep, but couldn't wait for Logitech to put out another mail-in rebate. Well worth it if you need remote camera moving capability - the alternatives (ie. by Dlink) are >$200!"
1,horrible,"what seemed like a wonderful idea - new and advanced.. has turned out to be a thorn in my side - and left me with trying to find a new camera.the good side - is the picture quality is state of the art.that is all.after the first day - the face tracking stopped working.. and now the entire camera wont tilt upwards. for now, its sitting on books.a total waste of money. - i had the first Logitech series cam they had out.. and it worked like a champ - and still does.. however now its too obsolete to work with XP."
1,Great Idea - Crappy Attempt,"Well out of the two Orbits I bought, one last for about a month working perfectly, then it quit panning. The second I bought to see if it was a fluke didn't work right out of the box. I think this product is a little to complicated for what ever 3rd world country is assembling them. I say save your money and pass on this one."
1,Not for Mac,"It's supposed to be Mac compatible, but it doesn't work with most IM programs like iChat, MSN, etc. It only works with Yahoo! IM and only without sound and VERY LOW pisture quality."
4,good quality cam,"good quality cam, but not as user friendly as i'd have liked it to be. i used it for about 6 months before replacing it with something else. would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a higher quality cam without wanting to spend hundreds on it."
4,Great little cam,"It's easy to use, easy to set up, has decent enough picture quality, oh yeah, and it's a great price."
1,Plain doesn't work,"I cannot reccomend this camera at all. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I've been searching around the web to see if there were other people's reviews (to see if they have the same problems with it). The ""only"" problem with the camera is that the pan/tilt mechanism is completely broken. The camera won't move half the time and it's pretty much stuck all the way in the down position so it won't look at my face. I think I'm just going to go and replace it with a ""cheap"" $40 camera. This is a useless, $120 piece of garbage and Logitech should be ashamed."
1,Doesn't work on Windows 2003,Don't buy this if you using Windows 2003. The SUnMapLS_IP_EBP_16 error will kill you.
3,Doesn't Work On XP Computers,"If you run it on Win 2000 computers, its awesome. You can pan and tilt across a whole room manually or let the face tracking software track you during a video conference. The face tracking works very well as long as you don't have too noisy of a background in the room to confuse the camera. If we all ran Win 2000 machines, I'd rate the product a 4 star!Unfortunately, the product doesn't work well on my New Dell Windows XP machine and a few other people have reported a similar problem on XP machines. The range of the pan and tilt seems to mysteriously only be about 20 percent of full range. It looks like a softare problem. If Logitech fixes this bug, we're back to 4 star all around.To get a 5 star rating, Logitech would need to include some more useful software like motion detector software, and the ability to control your camera remotely via the web. As it is you can only control it locally at your PC."
3,"Nice camera, but doesn't work as well as I hoped on a MAC!","Awesome design and great for PC, but I hoped it would work better on a MAC! It is an outstanding webcam though!"
1,just wouldnt work with win xp,windows error claimed that this cameras logo wasnt certified by microsoft so to procede with install would jepordize system stability. then it kept asking for a driver that i had installed. so bottom line is it never would work. i tried it on an intel and amd machine both late models with win xp and niether worked. this is the second logitech camera i have had similar problems with and will probably not buy from them again.
4,Worth the Cash,It is by far the best... this cam is worth the money and geeks.com has it for a great deal!If you're considering buying a webcam - GET IT. It's WELL worth the extra cash...definitely
1,for mac users - stay away..,Bought this for a mac as it sated it was compatible and found that its not!..witht the more current versions of OS X. Logitech has not updated anything. Hows that for compatible!!
1,Just got my money back at Sam's Club,I read all the reviews and decided to gamble on the Orbit. I assumed I would have problems with it and I was right. I'm quite an expert adding equipment to computers but it took me about three hours to get my Dell XP to recognize it and it would go through it's demo motions just fine but little else. Then it lost it's vertical motion. It never had the face recognition ability. I tried everything I could think of but I could only get it to move horizontally. I followed the instructions to the letter and I tried their help center which leaves a lot to be desired. Finally I downloaded new drivers which took four hours (26500 modem speed) and nothing changed. It's now back at Sam's Club in the reject pile. I never had a webcam before and I decided today I don't think I need one. At least not until someone makes one similar to the Orbit that really works. I figured it was just too good to be true. Wake up Logitech!!!!
1,Scared me off!,"I bought the first Essentials disk and had very little trouble with it. I had an older JVC 32"" and using the disk helped a lot. Now, I live with a plasma and 2 LCDs, all HD. After reading these reviews, I think the settings I am using currently are just fine (I've done some minor tweaking). Thanks for the heads up folks!"
3,Save Money for a movie DVD...,"I bought this DVE when it first came out. Calibrated my Panny PT-53WX53 TV many times with this DVE (I used ""Monster Inc."" movie to calibrate my TV when I first bought the TV a month ago...). The calibrated result with this DVE? Very minimum difference noticed from a Monster Inc-calibrated TV. I meant ""minimum"" difference. If I had a chance, I would not buy this DVD and rather use that money to buy some decent movie DVD. My advice: Use Monster Inc DVD to calibrate your TV and save some money!"
3,Very hard to navigate,"It's easier to just grab a doggone video generator by the time you find what you're looking for. VERY confusing menu tree, and if you have any experience with color TV, your eyes and a TV show will do just fine. This is nothing but a stunning collection of fantastic test patterns that are nearly impossible to find, and it would probably even impress the customer to see all those cool things up on the screen.So after you finish setting up the TV to the DVD, go back to a regular TV program and adjust for a natural flesh tone, which is what you do in the first place.I adjusted the picture to suit my eyes, and it very closely matched the recommendations on the DVD. This is something I would create just because I know how gullible most people are.Buy this if you like to play with DVD's. Use a generator if you're trying to make any money setting up TV's."
3,Not for the novice,"I didn't want to pay the $200 - $300 most places want to calibrate my new LCD HD TV, so I purchased Digital Video Essentials. The product allows you to calibrate both the audio and video portions of your home theater system. The video portion is divided into basic and advanced calibration. The basics are just that: brightness, contrast, sharpness, and RGB color tuning. Anything beyond that requires you to be a total video expert, as their process is filled with unintelligible jargon that only a video engineer would understand. I never got to the audio portion."
3,Somewhat technical,This item is very detailed but very technical. I think the average person will find it somewhat frustrating to use.
2,Difficult to navigate,"I had a hard time finding the test signals I was looking for, and I wish it gave better instructions on how to adjust your TV settings to improve the viewing experience."
4,Skip to the end,"The Menus and intros were slow and a waste of time. Just skip to the reference material and get it done quickly and accurately. If they included a half page insert for instructions, half the DVD could be deleted. The results are good but that menu is a pain."
5,Excellent lesson plan for videophiles!,"I found the program to be both interesting and informative. The host gives background info for each video display setting, then tells you what the reference screen should look like when properly set. Each video display slide scale only has two options, UP or DOWN! Adjust each setting UP or DOWN until the reference screen matches his description. I think the host's abrupt stops may be throwing some people off.I thought my 32"" HDTV LCD picture was great before, but now it's definitely better."
2,Too confusing,This disc is very complete and has a lot of content if you can find it. The test patterns and sound test are great but the menu system is so crazy and hard to use that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I've used it a few times and the only way I can find everything is to watch every preview to get to the content and patterns you want.Again it's exellent if you can figure out the menu but there are better disc's on the market.
3,a good one for beginners,i used both DVE and Avia to calibrate my projector and eventually i have to say that Avia has better brightness + contrast procedure.in addition Avia has 10 to 100 IRE screens which are absolutely essential if you use calibration equipment.still DVE is not bad at all and allows to do a lot of calibrations.it has elaborated explanations how to use it (too long in my opinion).
2,Not for the average HDTV owner,"While the information is helpful, the instructions to complete the tests are poor. I figured out when to use the Blue filter but how about the green and red filter, where is the test for those? Too much technobabble, not enough step by step instructions for the average person."
2,Too much theory,"The basic adjustments are explained, but they are buried in a long winded explanation of video theory and history. If you just want to adjust your TV for optimum picture quality you have to navigate the menu system to get to a specific test. Also there are many advanced audio and video tests included on the disc, but no explanation of how to use them."
2,Hard to use...,"While there seems to be a ton of information on the disc it's like pulling teeth to figure out how to use it. Yes there is a basic calibration section which steps you through a few very basic settings, but to do anything beyond that seems difficult if not impossible without some special equipment. There seem to be no instructions as to how to use the multitude of test patterns at the end of the disc. While the beginning of the disc seems to cater to the average enthusiast looking to improve his/her system, it sometimes becomes both way overdone at times and at others you are left wondering exactly what to do. Navigation is terrible, no other word for it. Unless there are additional instructions as to how to utilize the bulk of the information on the disk, I think I would look for a different product for performing a calibration on my tv."
1,Instructions are a big guess,When the DVD tells you to compare one thing to another on the screen the instructor does not explain what that thing is. Uses terms that are not defined anyplace.I am not stupid and have kept up with most home stereo/5.1 and have my own in two separate rooms.Until they define the objects on the screen and what to do with them this DVD is not for most users.
2,Disappointed,"This one is dated; if you are new to Hi Def TV you will get some history lessons. However..I got to the point where I was supposed to test red buy looking at bars on my TV thru the red plastic. I could NOT see what the audio told me I would see, and finally I gave up. Bad eyes? Bad description?I have noticed that many of these fine-tuning video DVD's get poor reviews. Maybe this whole concept of describing video outcomes in print or in audio is a challenge beyond doing. I have joined the ranks of the disappointed."
2,To Complicated For Normal Person,"I'm pretty knowledgeable on HDTV but I have no clue how to calibrate the TV with the test patterns. Pretty much a waste of money for me. Great tool for a professional but if your not, don't bother."
3,happy with my purchase,"Amazon sent the item in a timely manner. as expressed everywhere, it is not an item to buy and learn how to use in five minutes, but I had expected that. It does have everything I need to take care of correcting my display."
2,needs work,this product is not user-friendly. i am not a dummy but it had me scratching my head several times trying to figure out what exactly a instruction meant.
5,DVE Manual,"If people would just search around on the internet...It took only a few minutes to find the link to the manual.Here is a link to a 69 page manual for DVE in PDF format.I have not read it all yet. But seems to give detailed descriptions of navigation (still not the smoothest) anddescriptions of how to use the test patterns.http://www.videoessentials.com/docs/DVE_Consumer_NTSC.pdfOne more link I found, explains a little simpler the ""basic"" adjustments. It's a review from Audioholics, but talks about and shows what the test patterns should look like after adjustment.http://www.audioholics.com/techtips/setup/avhardware/DigitalVideoEssentialsDVDr2.phpThere also is a page one... that talks about Audio"
2,Not as new as my equipment,The item was out of date and does not reflect the current state of television technology. There are no references to LED/LCD devices.
3,A little hard to understand,A little hard to use - somewhat confusing menus. But disc came in perfect condition and I'll have to learn how to use it appropriately.
2,Lackluster,"I have a basic home theater setup, and I did not find this disc helpful. It may have been too detailed for what I was trying to do."
3,Nice to have,"Also need an audio meter to use the audio setup--I think of myself as an audiophile, have an aperion audio 7.1 system, with a high end onkyo receiver.The onlyo does not have an automatic tuning system, so I need to configure the levels for the speakers manually.So I have used this DVD to set it upI liked the audio setup. I re-do the tuneup every few months.You can really feel the difference before/after. 5 stars here.--I've also used the video setup, to tune the colors of my HD TV, but often go back to the TVs own settings.The ""custom"" setting I create help only for some movies.But the TV's dynamic mode, seems best for a majorty of shows/movies. 4 stars here.---As other readers said, very,very difficult to navigate. I found the easiest way is to go back to main menu and then navigate. 2 stars here---Still a good DVD to have.--"
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy anything from Joe Kane Productions,The basic adjustments are explained but you have to sit through long winded explanations of video theory and history before it will give you a test pattern. It should just explain what setting you need to change and what to look for and then give you the test pattern. Just getting to the first test pattern takes approx 30 minutes of the narrator endlessly gabbing. There are advanced audio and video tests included on the disc but there are no explanations as to how to use them. I bought this way back in 2001 when it first came out and recently decided to pull it out to (finally) adjust my LCD TV - big mistake as most of the patterns and tests will only apply to a CRT anyway.
4,Video Essentials,"Product is fairly easy to use. Probably has a lot of stuff you won't use, but it's there if you need it. My LCD HDTV looked much better after following the tips in the video."
2,Good for CRT displays and nothing else.,I Basically couldn't use this with my Sony bravia xbr4 LCD because most of the test material is for CRT displays. What a huge waste of money!
3,"Good, but gets old","My son, almost age7, loved it for a week or two then got bored. He still goes back to it occasionally, but it doesn't hold his attention like some other games."
4,Very good,"The track has it's mix of old and new. My favorites?? Of course have to be Glenn Lewis's Fall again, Kelly Rowland and Train on a track, and Miracles by RES is good as well. Love the theme by Alan Silvestri, but it is TOO SHORT! Get this though!"
2,Not the best but a few goodies,"I recently saw the movie and i have to say that it is the most cliched movie i have ever seen. Producers of ""Pretty Woman"" should sue the producers of this movie.The soundtrack aint too good either but i do like a few songs though. ""Im coming out"" by Amerie is a bloody good song, very catchy. And I dont think that Jennifer Lopez would sing this song very good at all. She wouldnt be able to reach the high notes plus theres not enough music in the background of the song to wash out her horrrible vocals. You only have to listen to ""All I have"" to realise how bad her voice is. The other song I like is ""If your not the one"" by Daniel Bedingfield, this is a great song, and he has a great voice. Im glad that Jennifer Lopez didnt sing at all on this soundtrack."
3,Glenn Lewis and Norah Jones Shine!!!,"Pretty good music overall, but the sounds of Glenn Lewis (who makes a cameo appearance in the movie) and Norah Jones help this soundtrack to rise above being mediocre."
3,Too big and holes already,My fault for getting an extra large ; medium prob would have been plenty big. Comfty. Good grip for tiding; but tgd fingers are already wearing through after a few uses. U could find better
4,Nice Gloves,These gloves are nice. They're not as warm as I hoped but I like the way they fit and their ease of use.
3,"Riding gloves, cheaply made but good for hot seasons","Cheaply made but good for riding in the summer months are they are thin. Good grips, velco will last a long time. Still most depressing feature is that they are so thin and cheap. May not last as long as the velcro. Wouldn't pay more than $8.00 or else you're paying too much."
4,Very nice gloves,The gloves feel well constructed. They've got a great grippy texture on the palm. And they are reasonably warm in cold weather!
1,Didn't get item,"Purchased Item and didn't receive, were not polite in return e-mails. Daughter still hasn't received her Christmas present from Video Plus"
4,Really great and simple,"I like Metal Gear Solid, and this is a simple version of it (but as fun) It's challenging, as well as with a lot of stratergy. Fun, especially for the Christmas season."
3,"A bit dated, but interesting","Schweizer has certainly done extensive and compelling research into the murky world of economic espionage. He raises some red flags that should not be ignored. However this book stops near its publication date of the mid-1990s, and that makes its content ""dated"". Are we doing better today? If I have to read about it from another book by Schweizer, I will probably pass on it. I found the presentation more like a textbook than a ""page-turner"" -- instead of saying ""I could hardly put it down, I find myself recalling that I could hardly pick it up -- sometimes reading only a single page in a day.Still, if you are interested in the clinical history of our ""friends"" stealing us blind for technolgical information, and bid-jumping -- hey give it a shot!"
5,Excellent Book&#65533;Recommended Highly,"As an educator, I found this to be an excellent reference book on psychological and emotional abuse. The editors have organized and critiqued a nice assortment of contributions from some of the top people in the field of psychology and domestic abuse. As Dr. Maiuro points out in his introductory chapter ""Sticks and stones can break your bones, but names (as well as other forms of derogation and abuse) can also hurt you."" While some of the work is technical and appropriate for advanced students and professionals, it is clearly written and includes actual tests that are used to determine whether someone is psychologically abused. I highly recommend it."
2,OK wet hair comb,this comb is good for helping wet hair dry a little faster. it scratches the scalp a little though.Update - i broke a tine/tooth? of this comb fairly easily early on in it's life. Probably would not invest in the same comb again.
1,Breaks easily,I bought this comb less than three months ago and I already have to replace it. I use it to comb the conditioner through my hair in the shower (the big teeth) and within weeks a the little teeth started breaking off. Finally the entire thing just snapped in half.
3,"Gentle on hair, but fragile.","I'm on my third of these combs, because I haven't found anything else that works as well for both detangling and applying comb-through conditioning treatment. The plastic is smooth, with no sharp edges between the tines like you find on many inexpensive combs. As a result, my fine and dry hair doesn't break from using it.However, the finer tines on the comb do start to break rather quickly. I find I've usually lost about half the fine tines after about 6 months of owning the comb.Still, it's the best I've found, and at the price it's still worth it to just replace the comb when it has lost too many tines to be useful."
1,comb,This comb is not very sturdy. It is made of cheap plastic which I expect to break soon. Not meant for a girl with a full head of hair.
2,extremely fragile,"The comb is good in that it has wide tooth & fine tooth in one. Downside is it's extremely fragile as it's made of a glass like material. Two teeth have already broken off when it slipped into the sink. Had it been made of a stronger material (plastic) I would recommend, but b/c it's breaks easily not worth the investment."
5,The next chapter in Robotech,This is the second chapter in ROBOTCH (the american version anyways). Heres a list all the chapterschapter 1: Macross Sagachapter 2: The Robotech Masters (this is what this box set covers)chapter 2.5: robotech II; the sentinals (covers the time inbetween chapters 2 and 3)chapter 3: The new generationHopefully eventually they will put the 3rd chapter on DVD also. I believe they will eventually.
3,I wish it was cordless,"I really enjoy using this phone. It is really durable and the batteries seem to last forever, I just wish it was cordless."
3,It's Worth The Price,"I use to have the Bell Sonecore BE-100HT until I dropped it one two many times and pulled the cord out of the headset. Just got the BE200HT today. Seems to work just fine. I am happy with it. Minor cons. Display contrast is low and hard to read straight on. It seems to be made to read at a low viewing angle. The volume control range is limited. It can be adjusted to between loud and near loud. It just does not have the range from low to high that my previous BE100HT did. The ""belt clip"" on the back is still the cheap plastic design that broke on my last one. I expect it will not last long on this one either. The write up on Amazon at the time I posted this still mentions cordless/cell/2.5mm jacks. All wrong. The picture is correct though. It is basically a hands free headset that connects with the phone cord and needs 4 AAA batteries. It is worth the ...price though. I am happy with it."
3,my wife loves these,My wife loves these but I think she is hard on headsets.I bought 5 last time because eventually they will quit workingafter a few months of use.I don't think that's all that unreasonable.They have to endure a lot of punishment.
5,The best tea you will ever drink,I first tasted this wonderful black tea six years ago in Ireland and was amazed. No tea can compare with the rich flavor. Since then I have bought Barry's Gold Blend tea through a coffee importer--it is the only tea I drink. Now I see that it is available on Amazon--fabulous!
1,"Shop worn goods, almost out of date","Barry's Tea Gold Blend, 80-Tea Bag Boxes (Pack of 6)The retail size boxes (I.E. individual 80 bag boxes) were shop worn. Simi-crushed, worn on edges. The experation date was 01/08 (in October),Amazon immeadiatly gave a refund but in Florida Barry's tea is not to be found."
2,photo deceptive,"The photo is deceptive. The diamonds are microscopic, and the gold chain as thin as a strand of hair. The moon is depicted as hanging by one end with the angel ""sitting"" upright, but the chain is attached to both ends of the moon, making it look like a ""U"". I gave it as a gift to my daughter, but we will have to get a better chain before this one breaks."
4,Painted Faces is a beautiful portrait...,"I first saw this movie at a film festival some years ago. Jackie Chan came personally to share some of his favorite films. I so enjoyed this movie that I have never forgotten its impact on me. Knowing that the story is based on the true-life experiences of Jackie and his friends as children under the care and discipline of the Chinese Opera makes it even more exciting to watch. The movie is full of acrobatics, make-up, and wonder. It's an intimate portrait of the life of these children and the world they lived, worked, and grew up in."
4,story of the seven little fortunes,"This film has a depth of character and humility that is all too often not found in todays movies. The performances are endearing all around. Even though Sammo Hung's character is a severe taskmaster, you cannot help feeling for him by the end of the film. And the children are a delight from the start. The martial arts sequences are masterfully executed. Moreover, the non-combbative focus of the choreography makes it a great choice for those who may be turned off by more hard core action. A good date film, although perhaps a step below Jackie Chan's Canton and Lady Rose in that department."
2,Painted Faces,So it tells you the story of how these boys grew up and how they eventually became kung fu stars. Movie was slow and seems like there wasn't enough lighting. Definately not worth the money you pay for the movie!
5,Scorpions...but different.,"This is a wonderful DVD! A wonderful blend of Scorpions music mixed with symphony! If you are a fan of their heavier stuff, this may not be the DVD for you, but if you are a huge fan of the band, then this is a must have for your collection! Enjoy!!"
2,A bit of a yawn,"Maybe I'm just not much of a fan of orchestras performing rock pieces, but I thought that this DVD was a disappointment, both in the song selections and in the way that the classic tunes were recomposed with the orchestral backing. The DVD quality was much better than the Wacken Open Air 2006 live concert DVD with respect to the cameras not jumping scenes every few seconds, but I thought that the songs came across as rather boring."
5,Bolling rocks! Rampal too!,This is really first rate composition and performance by Bolling and Rampal. Very happy and definitely puts a perk in one's step!
2,Finger Prints of the Gods,"It is an interesting book, however, it can be difficult to follow and get a clear understanding of what the author is attempting to say. It can be very dry in a lot of places as well, not something that just captures you and wants you to continue reading."
1,Suckers,"About 6000 years ago there was explosion of knowledge across the globe. Erich VanDaniken claims it could have come from aliens in ""chariots of the gods"". Now, we have Graham Hancock who says this knowledge must have been 'given to the world by a lost civilation', of wich he knows nothing about and rarely writes about. Whom this ""3rd party"" civilization is, was, or how it happened isnt mentioned either. A real suckers book."
1,Needs more evidence,"I am shocked by the number of positive reviews of this book. People in this country must have extremly little background in science if they believe the thesis of this book. If anyone had done research on any of Hancock's claims, they would know that he makes entirely illogical and unscientific arguments. Future readers- don't waste your time with this pretend science."
1,Good Story,"Not an academic work, to be sure, yet full of explanations. A combination of Paddington the Bear Abroad, Astrology and Who Shot JFK? In other words, it is a book whose central figure has lots of exciting travels, becomes obsessed with measurements, and eventually lapses into paranoiac disillusionment. Which just goes to show that talking bears from Lima, interested in the necessity of star movements, but in severe need of professional medical help, do not make good witnesses, but are nevertheless quite funny."
5,Great book,"Definitely one of the most thought provoking books I've read. I always felt like I wasn' t from around these parts, now I just need to figure out how to get back home."
4,ITS GOT ME DOING MY OWN RESEARCH TO VERIFY FOOTNOTES,"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FOWARD? THIS IS A WONDEFUL BOOK THAT GRABBED AND HELD MY ATTENTION MANY A PLANE FLIGHT AND LATE NIGHT. THE SUBJECT WAS SO INTERESTING, THAT I FORCED MYSELF TO STAY WITH IT THRU A CONFUSING, ILL DEFINED JOURNEY. IF I HAD KNOWN WHERE THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO TAKE ME, I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE WITH LESS STRESS. NONE THE LESS, I AM BUYING 1/2 DOZEN COPIES FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, AND I WILL ATTACH MY OWN FOWARD. WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT OF TIME AND $. AT WORST I HAVE GATHER ENOUGH COCKTAIL TALK ON THE SUBJECTS TO KEEP ME IN DEMAND FOR... DAYS AT LEAST. JIM"
5,Spellbinding,This book represents the best interpretation on the subject. Von Daniken's hypothesis simply does not do the material justice. Hancock has done it
3,"Interesting, but.....","Starts off well with a fascinating discussion of maps, but I found things went downhill fast. Eventually I got so bogged down in the somewhat tedious presentation of the admitted wealth of information that I found myself skipping larger and larger chunks just to get to the actual theories. So an interesting thesis, but marred by rather poor writing technique"
5,Brain candy,This is an outstanding read. Hancock takes you into a world of history and science that most are never exposed to. His conclusions can be debated but his approach to revealing fascinating historical facts leaves the reader wanting more. Very few writers could make some of his areas of discussion as intriguing as he does. It's a must read for the intellectually curious.
2,Prove it...,"This is a very interesting book...the theories are fascinating. However, they are, in my opinion, based on bad science. I find it hard to believe that this Antedeluvian civilation vanished without a trace...I understand that the ""flash frozen"" prehistoric animals that are so prominent in this book were, in fact, not ""flash frozen"". They were, as it turns out, contained in glaciers, etc. not unlike many other ancient species. My most serious criticism, however, is with the shifting crust theory. Having done my research, the shifting crust, or earth crustal displacement, sounds very much like apocalyptic theory that, as is usually the case, cannot be proved or disproved. I don't know...maybe the Aztecs had it right and we're living on borrowed time...personally, I'm not selling my mutual funds!"
3,Hmm... where is the REAL evidence?,"Well i just finished the book and i think he had his up's and downs in theories both old and relatively new. I think he's jumping a little to fast to conclusions and racking orthodox scholars and Egyptologists a little too often.. Although i thought that some theories were interesting. He has said that it's his spiritual journey, so i don't know if he's considering a new religion or if he's going to bring forth more evidence to further support his theories. A good read but poor in certain facts. He's right about one thing, too allow other scientific branches access to the monuments around the world, and to search for other types of evidence.."
1,Half way I got bored.,"This book is not for the average reader. It goes into to much details that is seems to repeat it self. The begining was ok but when it goes into the pyramids of Egypt it just boring. I read other books from hancock and thinking that it was going to be a as good , but nottt!"
5,Fingerprints of the Gods,"Very thought provoking, and interesting hard to put down. really makes you wonder, are / were the only creatures of GODS Creation?"
4,Excellent read but a very one sided view,"A very interesting series of hypotheses presented in a very clear manner expounding the possibility of an ancient pre Egyptian civilization being responsible for the pyramids etc, the implication of which is to completely amend earth history as we currently perceive it. Striking in its attack upon conventional Egyptologists blinkered approach to the evidence when it suits them, but throughout you want to hear the contra view also."
1,Read This First,"I wish I had read ""The Wild Side of Geoarchaeology Page"", a web site maintained by Paul V. Heinrich, before buying this book. Like many reviewers, I was impressed by the ""evidence"" quoted in the book and the detailed references. But sadly Hancock's research seems to break down when those references are critically investigated. Finally, I am puzzled by the comments about the quality of the writing. I found it plodding, burdened by whimsical speculation and pointless introspection. Many times I wondered what the manuscript looked like before the editors went to work."
5,Will make you wonder.,"I can't begin to tell you how much fun this book is for someone like me who's fascinated by ancient civilizations. I've read it several times now, and have bought probably five copies for friends. It's very readable and brings ancient history to life brilliantly. I have read everything I can get my hands on about Atlantis and other ancient/legendary civilizations, but this one is so all-inclusive, it was a real joy to find. The book is fascinating, well-documented, and presents theories as theories without jumping to unanticipated and unfounded conclusions. Hancock's theories about Atlantis were surprising and thought-provoking. It's a big book, but if you have a love for ancient history, you will think of every page as a wonderful treat."
2,Guess work!,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. That being said, I found the authors traveling around the world and speculating on old fables to be quite annoying. The author does very little to back up his speculations with any documentation or fact. Maybe I'm old school, but I can do without guess work. Give me some fact."
4,"Well-based, Detailed, but Slightly Repetetive","This book is one of the most facinating I have ever read. It's well researched, with no lack of evidence, and an engaging writing style. Hancock rarely or never comes to any conclusion which he does not admit leaves room for doubt, so that the reader can carefully consider every point and disagree with some without ruining the whole read. The one complaint I have with this book is that far to much time is spent restating previous points and re-examining eveidence. That still leaves about 400 pages of strong evidence, enough to convince most open-minded sceptics. All in all, this book is a ebtertaining and thought-provoking, though about 100 pages of it could be safely omitted."
2,Hancock Visits the Temple of His Mind,"Hancock's book contains intriguing detail, but I just have to wonder about some of his assertions. The pyramids at Giza are certainly magnificent examples of ancient architecture. But, is the brilliance in their execution an example of extraterrestrial intervention in human events? Hancock provides numerous mathematical relationships to support his theories, but the question is: did the ancient Egyptians think as Hancock does? And, does the evidence which Hancock cites truly prove that ET visited ancient Egypt? Books such as this one serve as an important lesson to inquiring, intelligent minds: Belief can be the deciding factor in the ""truth"" one manages to see--a condition to which we are all susceptible."
2,"Great opening, slow middle","Fingerprints of the GodsAs usual, Hancock wonderfully introduces the general reader to different ancient subcultures; however, his reliance primarily on works by local alternative historians many of whose views have been clearly refuted by other scientists while ignoring almost anything that refutes his own thesis undercuts his credibility."
3,Lost me in the final chapters,"An interesting look at our civilization's past history. I read most of this book with an open mind until I reached the final chapters. I then became sceptical when Hancock started accepting clues from British Columbia (Canada's druggie capital) Atlantis kooks. Hancock then totally blew his credibility when he tried to pass off Antarctic fossils, which are millions of years old, as being only a few thousand years old. Hancock has written an interesting and well researched book, but he eventually blows it by his association with known whackos and his deliberate attempts to deceive us."
5,Unbiased Articulation,"I consider this a masterpiece of well documented information for every antropoligical student and those interested in learning more on originals and cultures. I find that the author presents his research with an unbiased approach. He articulates very well the different views of cultures from their way of though to influence in worldview in an unbiased way. Also he outlines the various issues and lets the reader decide. This book has greatly helped pull together the various puzzling findings from personal study and learning. Great book for everyone, specially to those who love cultures, history and languages."
2,Some questions that history readers formulate on their own,"Hancock surely makes some interesting questions, not answered by mainstream archeology. On the other hand, he seems to have had an idea and made all facts fit it, disregarding other input or other interpretations.Also, he has used a number of fiction writers tricks to make those ideas come through (like finding a ""badie"" - in this case, archeologists to- get sympathy for his ideas).Anyway, he does point to some unexplained archeology misterys, which haven't been well explained, so it may be worth reading for those not particularly keen on dry history reading. On the whole though, it is the kind of book that that just makes its author wealthier."
5,Opening many possibilities to the past.,"I read Fingerprints of the Gods two years ago and I was spellbound. It is a book that I hope to read again when time permits. It changed the way I look at much of the past and the way ""conventional historians"" approach it."
4,A book for people with an open mind.Brilliant reasearch,"I found this book difficult to put down,it is so very well put together and offers the reader their own opinion to be made on information given.I would reccomend this book for anybody who perhaps has an underlying knowledge of Egypt and ""ancient civilisations"".You could fell a bit ""in at the deepend"",if not."
4,Good fun,"Hancock views himself as an amateur historian and archaeologist. Although his conclusions are far-fetched, his techniques and his reasoning are not ungrounded. If you have a lot of spare time and are looking for something thought provoking, get this book."
5,Time to OPEN YOUR EYES,It's hard to swallow for most. But EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT ANCIENT HISTORY IS A LIE.Grahm Hancock only touches the surface of what is starting to be known about the Ancients.The Great Pyramid was not designed by the Egyptians.Several great minds in the past 100 or so years have stated it.Now great minds like Hancock are proving it.Pick up a copy of 'Secret of the Great Pyramid' by Sollog from 1995.He and Hancock are the foremost great minds proving we've all been lied to about our 'history'.OPEN YOUR EYESThis book will help you.
1,Great work of Literature....,"I think when the previous reviewer said this book was a great work of literature, he hit it dead on. It is a great Literary work, considering his theory changes from one book to the next and at will to suit his purpose. He claims to be an amateur and yet I will admit the theory is interesting yet the facts he chose to prove it are as unfounded as the mysteries he chose to disprove. There is no rock solid undisputable evidence to prove to me there was technological marvels on Antarctica or that the remnants are still two miles below the surface."
3,Sporadically interesting...,"The book has some really neat stuff in it, but it really drones on too long about extraneous subjects in between. Had trouble keeping my attention."
1,Not bad for a joke book,"Please remember that Hancock is first and foremost a journalist. His scholarly credentials on ancient archaeology are highly questionable and his theories have been laughed out of academic circles.There is absolutely no evidence to support his assumptions, and enough has been written to refute Hancock that I won't try here except to say that this book is sure to appeal to those who want to believe and who are unfamiliar with the facts of anthropology and archaeology. The idea that ancient man had any help -- much less access to higher technology -- flies in the face of every dig in the Middle East and mocks the thousands of hard-working archaeologists engaged in legitimate work.Keep this one in the Joke Book stack because it doesn't deserve any better."
1,Utter Nonsense,"When will the gullible learn? I laughed my head off when the so-called Pyramid on Mars turned out to be nothing but a bunch of amorphous rock. Hancock is a latter-day von Danicken, albeit lacking in originality. Were the book in the fantasy section, I would give it another star for it's amusement value, however, passing off this psuedo-science garbage as serious and seeing how popular the book has been is disturbing. I fear, as Lovecraft pointed out, that we are entering a new dark age of ignorance.Any serious minded scholar of Ancient Egypt should check out Leherner's book 'The Complete Pyramid."""
1,"Read for a laugh, and from it learn to think critically!","Garbage! I'm embarrassed I didn't more carefully investigate this book before wasting my money.Oh please, give me a break- a 2,000 mile shift of Antartica in a 11,000 year time period, isn't that like a geologic femtosecond? It must have caused some catastrophically enormous earth quakes. Why it is a miracle the earth didn't just blow up! Well, I'm no geologist (and neither was Albert Einstein, and by the way- what an appauling appeal to authority), but I do know there is a vast body of research literature (serious and peer-reviewed) about plate tectonics and paleoclimatology that could have, and should have been cited if this absurd hypothesis is to be taken seriously."
1,soap opera for uneducated reader looking for cheap sensation,"Any better knowing reader can recognize after a chapter or two, that this book is written by an author who is in a business of writing books, not of scientific research. Facts presented are selected to support author's theory, not to provide objective picture of the covered subject. Waste of money, unless you like to say WOW."
3,"5 stars for Epictetus, 2 stars for this book","First off, I think the world of Epictetus. The Enchiridion is an amazing work, laying out the groundwork for Stoic Philosophy. However, when compared to theEnchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions), this book isn't worth the extra money when compared to the Dover Thrift Edition. In fact, it's a lesser version. There are no extra background notes, no explanations or miniature biographies, and no footnotes.Save a few dollars and buy theEnchiridion (Dover Thrift Editions)instead. It's a far superior book."
3,CHRISTIAN FINANCIAL ADVICE,"I see that the other reviews of this book don't like the fact that it is Bible based. Then they shouldn't be reading a Bible based book! Larry Burkett was a very knowlegeable Christian that believes in the fact that Christians that live their lives following Biblical teachings are better off financially and emotionally. By todays non-christian standards, Larry's methods and standards may seem outdated and archaic however by Christian standards they are true and valueable in todays world.I have not read this book but am very familiar with Larry Burkett's teaching and writings as well as his radio show. For this reason I gave this book a 3 but when I have actually read it I am sure it will be a 5 star book like his other writings."
5,YAY!!!!!!!,"When I first saw the roxas plushie, I WANTED it! It was just so cute from the pictures. I waited 5 days from the day I ordered it (was too impatient), and recieved it! It's just what I wanted! haha :). There was no stains or anything, it had the perfect condition. I recommend this for kingdom hearts lovers :P."
5,The BIBLE for tube testers,This is simply the definitive book on tube testers. Easy to read but detailed. There is no other book published its equal.
5,Great Travel Tales,"If you've ever longed to travel, but somehow have never gotten around to it, this is a great book to read. I have traveled, but this book made me yearn to see all those places I missed at a time that is now gone forever. John Mason""s insight, his compassion and his sense of humor permeate the pages of this marvelous book. He makes you laugh, cry and see the world as he sees it. Good stuff!"
3,Fair performance,was a good alternative for the price but not a very powerful pump. Still it was a good bargain. Fair performance
1,Deceptive advertising,"This was not as it was represented. It was a partial set of hardware. No lumber, no slide, no door, no screws. Not a good deal. I would not reccommend it to anyone"
1,not happy,I have a problem with the fact that it is never mentioned that this is a kit. If I would have known this I would not have ordered it.
5,Tried juicer at a cooking school,Got to use this juicer at a cooking class to juice limes for salsa. Loved it and everyone in the class wanted one. I thought I was being frugal buying the yellow lemon juicer and would use it for limes and lemons. It works but you don't get the full lime juice using a lemon juicer due to size difference. Thus I have both juicers now. Fantastic - You get every drop of juice!
3,Just buy the bigger one,"There is nothing wrong with the way this is designed or made; it's just that it's unnecessary, because you can squeeze limes with one of the bigger ones made for lemons or even oranges. I actually think it's easier to use one that's a little bigger; this one is actually borderline too small for some limes."
1,Didn't last through 2 limes,Metal near the hinge failed as I was squeezing the second of 2 limes. Returning for a refund.
1,melagrotta,Bought this as a Christmas gift. Was impressed with the product until its first use. The lime proved tougher than the pot metal. The product broke in two. Of course the first use was AFTER the 30 day return date so now we are stuck with a broken lime squeezer.
4,Great tool!,"Rec'd this and the lemon squeezer, both function perfectly and so much easier than sqeezing them on the old fashions cone shaped squeezer."
2,If you like eating aluminum and acid together buy it!,"Save you money folks!This is the second Amco Enameled version we have purchased. They both have chipped after a few uses and the aluminum is exposed. Bad when you consider ingesting aluminum combined with citrus acid!I can think of better ways to poison myself, thank you very much!Go for stainless steel or plastic."
1,Good for an Occasional Squeezer!,"We have the orange, lemon, and lime squeezers. Ease of squeeze diminishes as size increases and fruit becomes firmer. An older, drier orange would be almost impossible for Hulk Hogan to get a drop out of. A small, juicy lime would be a whiz for an arthritic grandma.Our objections are, the enamel peels off where the juice contacts it most strongly and repeatedly, so that bits of paint fall in your food preparations; the acid in the juice attacks the bare aluminum and causes pitting; waxy coatings from the fruit which build up on the inside surfaces of the juicers attract dirt and mildew and are virtually impossible to remove; and finally, the pin that holds the pieces together is steel and rusts.Although these juicers get the juice out, we're now looking for an all stainless steel model with long enough handles so it doesn't take a lot of strength to juice a lemon, and doesn't shed paint and collect crud that can't be removed."
2,"good design works, but bad enamel doesn't stand up for long","I've had both the yellow lemon squeezer and the green lime squeezer for nearly a year -- and now both of them are loosing their enamel. We use them a lot -- and I expected more.Also, they don't give up the natural oils of the rinds in the dishwasher, and end up having to be washed by hand periodically. The small bowl shape is a real mess to try and clean. I'm going with stainless steel next time."
2,Doesn't Hold a MAC,"Big drag. Amazon says it holds 15.4"". Reviews on other sites (for less money, but I trust amazon) says it'll hold a 15.4"". Nope, not even close. My other iBook 14.1"" barely makes the cut. Too bad 'cuz it seems like exactly the material I want (tougher than neoprene). Description should be more concise as it was recommended by Amazon for the $2500 15.4"" MacBook Pro I bought from them, too."
4,Laptop case....,"I was very happy that my laptop fit, it looked like it would be too small at first. It did a very good job of protecting my Dell with 15.4"" monitor on a road trip. It was not bulky and actually allowed me to store it in either my suitcase (no, I did not have to check my luggage or I would never suggest carrying it this way) or my carry-all, which is not much more than a tote-bag.Two things that were drawbacks:1. It came delivered, although very promptly, in a huge box with ALOT of packing material. I don't live in the best neighborhood, so sending me things in the mail packed like that don't go over too well with whomever might be watching. It was bigger than the box my actual computer arrived in!2. There is no handle or way to carry other than holding the whole thing. This is ok if you have a bag, but sometimes just moving it from here to there, you want a little handle to make it easier.All in all I would recommend it, and actual, one of my friends just bought one for her laptop."
3,Title Confusion and Misleading Reviews,"In 1997 a sci-fi movie titled ""Hybrid"" and directed by Fred Olen Ray was released. In 2000 a documentary titled ""Hybrid"" about Milford Beeghly (an Iowa farmer and early developer of hybrid seed corn) and directed by Monteith McCollum was released. The customer reviews for Hybrid seem to be about the sci-fi movie, but the product details suggest the documentary is the actual item."
4,Wilton Armetale Acanthus tray,"I bought tray so I would have two, having bought the first one several years ago. This one arrived looking just like the first, but is MUCH lighter. Probably makes no difference, just surprised!"
1,DISAPPOINTED - The video halfway through is very jumpy and a lot of white noise.,"I have looked for this movie for some time, and after finally finding it was very disappointed with the quality of the tape. I guess because of the time I have had it, I am unable to return it. It is a shame as the movie is quite good."
3,A good outline for those with a physics background,"Atomic Physics is a fun, small book that covers most of the bare bones of atomic theory, and most of the important experiments, without ever getting too deep into the subject. It would be a frustrating read for anyone without a few semester of quantum mechanics and at least one semester of electromagnetism under their belt. The author outlines how these theories are important in atomic physics, but doesn't go into details on either. It's a good review of atomic physics topics, though, and shorter than the really thorough textbooks. Recommended for physics students studying atomic theory, or experimentalists looking to brush up on their atomic theory. But it's not detailed enough for a serious treatment of the subject, and assumes too much knowledge to be useful to non-scientists."
4,Hundred Days Review,"Elam's struggle to bounce back after his best friend's death is understandable for everyone but his father. He feels like he needs more time to adjust, yet his father decides to make the drastic move of to a small mining town a few hours away from home. It is here that Elam finds solace in both nature and solitude, and meets a new yet unlikely friend. Maybe the move, although heart-breaking at first, wasn't such a bad idea after all. Elam's new life provides a sense of rebirth in a barren desert. A Hundred Days from Home is a story of hope - a quick read and only slightly predictable."
5,Great book from a new author,"Elam is a loner. Since the death of best friend in a river accident, Elam prefers to spend his time in the mountain wilderness. Elam's father doesn't think the solitude is good for his son. He decides to move the family to Arizona, hoping Elam will make new friends and come out of his self-imposed loneliness. But Elam doesn't fit in with the locals his father wants as his friends. Instead, he meets Refúgio, a boy his father doesn't approve of because of his nationality. Will Elam be forced to give up his first real friendship since Brett's death because of his father's prejudice?"
5,Informative with great photography!,This book gives lots of information about the biology and ecology of America's wild horses. There are many interesting facts for horse lovers. The photography is stunning. A beautiful book.
2,"Storage rack, yes. Handy gourmet sliding, not so much.","Design is poor - out of the box, it looked like it could fall apart at any touch, let alone if I actually slid the racks in-and-out. I modified the frame with some tape and string, and now it's decently stable. Going forward, I will still be careful when putting stuff in or taking stuff out of these racks."
2,"increased storage, difficult to use",I was disappointed by this product. The baskets are a good size and well built but the metal piece used to hold them together and allow the baskets to move is not really strong enough to do a great job. It all works and I am happy to have it at a great price but I should have paid more for a better one.
2,Not very steady,"The bottom part is good but the top one is not very steady when you put cleaning bottles there and try to slide it.I did have to come with an ""idea"" to make it steady, but it should be redesigned."
2,Not worth it,"Very flimsy. The drawers aren't held in by anything other than sitting atop the rack, so they often fall off if you pull even a little harder than intended, making even more of a mess than it would be had you not used this to organize in the first place. Bottom line... don't waste your money on this product."
2,Not worth the money,"Very flimsy. Bought it to organize under the kitchen sink, but find it easier to not use this product. Doesn't hold much anyways."
3,Satisfied,This rack isn't very big and probably can't hold much weight but it does fit in one of my smaller cabinets. There aren't any rollers and the baskets just sit on the rack itself. All in all it will help me reach what I need in the back of the cabinet.
2,Poor design,"Poor design and not the best assembly.The shelves do not sit or slide very well at all.The frame in which they sit is loose at the top - so tries to come apart, making the top shelf even less well executed."
3,It's okay but not that great,"I bought this to sit under my bathroom sink and help organize all my make up and hair products. It works just fine I guess but one thing I was unaware of when I purchased it was that the baskets are not actually attached to the frame. If you lift it or move it they will fall off. This should not be an issue if it is just sitting in the cupboard but I just found it very odd. It doesn't seem to be as flimsy once stuff is on it.It was also a little smaller than I imagined even though Amazon did provide accurate measurements. It fits easily in between the sink plumbing and the side with room to spare, I guess I expected it to be wider and fit more snugly. It also doesn't reach all the way back but that is fine for me as I have stuff to store behind it.I paid $12.99 for it and honestly I don't think if I saw it in a store I would have be willing to pay more than $10."
4,Storage rack,Great little rack for the price. Holds a lot of items for storage under the sink in the kitchen.
3,good but,Good tomatoes but the shipping costs make them too expensive I found San Marzano in the local Shop Rite Supermarket at half the price
3,Only half a product!,"VocabuLearn is my favorite vocabulary building program, but I was really disapointed that they didn't take better qulity assuranse checks. I recieved the Arabic CDs with a Hebrew book. When I recieved a replacement the same thing happened. I hope that they resolve the issue. I really wanted to start learning and love their system"
4,Interesting,Been an interesting read. everyone has a view on everything and it is always nice to review another's view.
3,Mixed Feelings,"I did a review for the second book as well so I'll just add some different stuff here. I am very open minded (and open hearted which I think is more important) and found an underlying theme in the four books I read that did not feel right to me. You can read the material and just sense how it makes you feel. Some of the reviews make it sound like if you don't read it or if you find any issue with the material then you're a limited person. That's not the case at all! Just because something is channelled ""from the other side of the veil"" doesn't mean it's totally kosher. We exist on the other side of the veil too and we are all surrounded by beings all the time. It's up to us to determine what we want to integrate into this lifetime and what we don't. Trust your intuition with any material you read or listen to, your higher self knows what's what."
5,Kryon-The End Times,This book is a must for all metaphysical students and any one who is looking to grow spiritually and to help heal the earth. My friend lent me the second copy she purchased; as she is constantly lending her first copy to one of her friends and decided she needed another one. I started reading it the evening I took it home and couldn't put it down. The knowledge is enlightening and the Love that comes through is overwhelming. Before I give it back I am purchasing my own copy to keep and to reread.
5,Percy Mayfield,"This is probably the only Documentary available for the great R&B; singer song writer Percy Mayfield. It includes a live club performance from 1981 and footage shot at his home in December 1982.He talks about his life and music and sings some of his famous compositions.A 1952 auto accident left him seriously injured, including a facial disfigurement. This limited his performing for sometime However, this did not stop his songwriting.In 1961 he wrote ""Hit the Road Jack"" which became a hit for Ray Charles.When Mayfield died of a heart attack in 1984, the day before his 64th birthday, he had fallen into obscurity.This Video is a rare opportunity to see into the life of a truly great artist."
3,"Got it for my toddler, but Donald is not the best option","I've been slowly collecting all the videos in this series, but this one is definitely the worse of them all. My toddler still loves watching it, but Donald tends to have lots of anger issues and there's one cartoon in here where he really goes crazy with his behavior. I'm a huge fan of Disney cartoons, and my toddler loves them all - but I'm rating this 3 stars because it's the worse in the series and I think people who are concerned with content will like to know that Donald gets very angry several times in here (he breaks furniture, and throws things out the window, bites stuff, etc...)"
3,A book with a wealth of detail and numerous typo errors,"This book is really quite attractive, with a stunning dustcover and a highly promising topic. The Grande Armee of 1813 as Scott Bowden clearly shows, was a makeshift army and Grande was a semantic concept. There is a very detailed breakdown of the units of the 1813 Grande Armee in an extended appendix and the text reads quite well. What throws me off is the numerous typo errors in the text (there are a lot of them!) and although I am not in a position to comment on the accuracy of the breakdown of the units, I am uncertain as to whether careless editing may have also crept into the appendix, hence the ambivalent rating."
5,A Great Fun Album,"after being in ireland buying all bjork cd's you can't get in canada, i found the time's promo cd. free! it was so cool, lots of cool stuff. the songs are fabulous, but the best would have to be the computer stuff. videos, wallpapers, snippets from her book. an amazing cd!"
5,A Real Eye Opener,Well supported by fact and Examples. Just wish I had read it years earler as I could have saved many $. I just couldn't put it down. Now I wouldn't be without it.
4,Exceptional book,"This is a very valuable book for any investor. Despite most economists' attempts to complicate matters, Dent gives the reader an invaluable insight into how profoundly simple economic prediction can be. Fundamentally, he shows how it all boils down to demographics. I'd challenge any economist to prove him wrong."
3,The Concubine,"Good story. I love anything that has to do with Tudor England. I am especially interested in Anne Boelyn. This is not THE BEST story about her; however, it is still a good read and I recommend."
4,"Good Product, took forever to arrive!!","Good Product, took forever to arrive!! But when it did it was in good condition. The book was a good read, I am glad that I made the purchase!!"
5,Poor Anne Boleyn!,"""The Concubine"" is a vividly detailed novel about the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn, who became King Henry VIII's second and most notorious wife. The book generally portrays Anne as a victim and Henry as a villain who set his sights on Anne when she was 16 years old and eventually tired of her, casting her aside to make way for Jane Seymour. This is an interesting spin on Anne Boleyn's story because it pulls in numerous other characters who aren't mentioned in great detail in other books about this time period, including Anne's stepmother and female servant. Anyone who is as obsessed with Tudor history as I am will love this book!"
3,"Charming Book, not a good biography","This is a charming story. Great reading for a lazy Sunday afternoon, although not a very good biography. This is a fictious story, based loosely on facts and evidence, not to be mistaken for a biography. Although it is a very nice read. It skips years quite quickly, and I would only recommend it for someone who is already familiar with this period of time, so that you can follow what is going on."
1,Boring,Worst book written bya human being!Very schizophrenic!If you wish to waste your timego right ahead and read it.
1,The Qur'an,I was disappointed with this book because the cover and book were put together backwards! I didn't have the time to send it back for an exchange because my son was in need of it now. He will have to read it from back to front now...very disappointing to say the least!
4,Cinevox Edition,"This is the Cinevox edition that was previously available only from the more expensive Japanese King edition. The sound quality here is just as good as the Japanese CD so there's no need to fork over more of your hard earned money.This is the soundtrack to the spy flick starring Tony Musante that shows Goblin's incredible versatility to adapt to a particular genre and breathe new life into it. Don't expect a ""Profondo Rosso"" or a ""Suspiria"" type of soundtrack here. This is a very solid soundtrack that mixes elements of progressive rock and new age that produces very satisfying results.A worthwhile addition to your Goblin library."
5,An Exceptional Historical Accounting,"Galligan's self-imposed cause and effect guidelines coupled with his apparent devotion to research leave little to one's imagination in reading this superbly organized accounting of COLAHAN's history. From an immense pool of historical sources he has carefully and methodically gleaned far more than the origin, purpose and destiny of a single FLETCHER Class Destroyer; he has included well rationalized motivation behind world events that effected COLAHAN's responsibilities. One need not be a historical enthusiast to acknowledge and admire this exceptional book."
3,The Sphinx - a mystery of mysteries.,"OK there are things going on with the Sphinx. Things that are unexplained. This book opens the door to the thought process related to the dating of the Sphinx and the stellar alignment of it. I found it a general good read. Slow in some parts, and Graham hancock spent a bit of time going over and over on some basic points. But after reading the book, you should find yourself in agreement that the actual age of the Sphinx is much older than what is conventially established. If you are looking for the details of the hidden passages and other such cult inforation, then this book would disappoint you. It spends much of it's content on the dating of this object."
5,wonderful read,i love books about such things. graham is a killer dood and i love his works. hes fine just fine
4,Exciting and thought-provoking,"The author's arguments, though a little out there, made logical steps using alternative views and acurate information. You might not agree with the conclusions of the author, but it will get you thinking about your own convictions regarding this subject."
2,Graham could have done this book in just a few chapters.,"Sorry, but this book is incredibly repetitive....complaints about Hawass and his lack of ""understanding woo-woo"" in finding hidden rooms/buried treasure/buried religious rituals, complaints about calculations of the stars...chapter after chapter saying the same thing, particularly about Edgar Cayce's prophecy about the Sphinx.(Spoiler) 10,500 B.C. was the ""start"" date of this civilization, according to the author.Save your bucks....it's not worth the effort to plow through, and the photos are very old, nothing up-to-date."
1,"The new ""Chariot of the Gods?""","After a couple of decades it appears that two new hucksters have appeared to claim Erick Von Daniken's mantle as the top purveyors of nonsense dressed up as serious intellectual inquiry into the past. All in the name of making a buck on the ignorant, of course.This book is so laughably ridiculous that its amazing to me that anyone takes it seriously. Of course, the authors base their entire case on their readers NOT knowing much of anything about their subject matter. If they did then they'd see this stuff for the tripe it is.If you want to read a good book on early Egypt go get Toby Wilkinson's ""Early Dynastic Egypt"" or something by Mark Lehner.This book is just garbage with a distinctly New Age odor to it."
5,Mathematical-Religious-Astronomy,"I have nothing but praise for Graham and Robert on this masterpiece of unorthodox history. Whether they are right or wrong in their hypothesis, this book certainly brings up enough solid data to at least get the reader questioning what we now `know' as history.I subscribe to the reason that is put forward in regards to why the pyramids were built. But more so, I am fascinated by how the conclusion was made. Bringing mathematics, religion and astronomy all together, pouring over the ancient myths and texts - it was a journey of discovery that you should all be a part of. Do you remember the road to the Duat?"
4,Getting closer to the truth...,"Interesting reading material. Yet the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle is still missing. Personally speaking, I believe it can be found and will. However I don't believe its in written text. I believe it will come via the subconscious mind if the body is correctly placed in an energy field within the sphynx. I am a clairvoyant from Durban S. Africa."
5,RIVETTING READING TO THE LAST PAGE,"I READ THIS BOOK ENTITITLED KEEPER OF GENISIS..... IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME......IT MAKES US HUMANS RETHINK OUR SO-CALLED HISTORY AND EVERYTHING WE'VE BELIEVED IN.........IT DEALS WITH A WORLD AS ADVANCED IF NOT MORE THAN OURS,A WORLD WHERE EVRYTHING AND ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE......THE GIZA PLATEAU IS A GLOBAL MONUMENT NOT AN EGYPTIAN MONUMENT AND SHOULD BE OPEN TO EVERYONE AFTER THE TRETH ABOUT MANKIND............GRAHAM HANCOCK AND ROBERT BAUVAL COME CLOSEST TO REVEALING THIS TRUTH AS THE BOOK IS EXCITING READING TILL THE VERY LARGE PAGE.................."
4,A book that needs to be read,A well written book . This book shows the connection with astronomy and how far back Egypt really goes. An absolute must read!
4,Pretty good,"The Message of the Sphinx was a great book that opened my mind. BUT SKIP SECTION 3! The author uses double and triple meanings of words, then states that the Egyptians were saying something significant by that. However, the other sections were intriguing and well thought out. Hancock made me believe that Egypt was a legacy, and anyone who reads this book will likely consider that fact. And by the way, I never found out what the message of the Sphinx was."
4,Secrets and choices,"In a culture that prizes family and breeding, the most important legacy is the bloodline, or the family tree. Sometimes something startling comes to light when a person like Caroline starts to probe the past, and we are reminded that those dry, half-forgotten names in the family Bible were once breathing, passionate humans making choices and mistakes, just like ourselves.This book tells the story of Caroline and her secrets and dilemmas, and yes, the subject of abortion is one of the issues. But Dr. Moser lets her characters hold the opinions and make the decisions on this heated topic. Both pro and con are here, but each character's choice is based on what he or she believes in and values. The narrative will wrap you in warm Southern surroundings, and the secrets will keep you enthralled, both in guessing what they are and in wondering how they can be resolved.It might leave you wishing you had a Great-Aunt Kathleen of your own."
1,Don't buy this! What a ripoff!,The ad says 30 min. long.The DVD box says 30 min. Run time.The dvd had 3 1/2 mins. of footage which repeated again for atotal runtime of 7 minutes!
5,Dexter Game,"This game is superb. It has great gameplay and follows the excellent story of Dexter's Laboratory. This game has almost completely changed my life! I can't stop thinking about it! If you are a Dexter fan, and I know you are, then buy this game. Without it, your life has no meaning!"
2,Love The Show...Hate The Game,"For all of you hardcore Dexter fans like me,you'll find this game as a major KICK IN THE HEAD! It is an utterly terrible, painstakingly horrible, sheerly awful game. It might as well of been a 7 year olds defective science project.WORTHLESS,WORTHLESS,WORTHLESS!Please just stick to the show,you will thank me later.It is the most terrible last minute excuse for a game EVER! Good idea gone horribly wrong!"
1,Worse printer ever produced,"I have this printer for about 3 months and it just never stop giving problems. It was noisey and always saying no paper, called the technician and they replaced it. same problem. the technician said that was a problem with these printers. So I upgraded to a wirelessMFC-8870DW. that did not solve the problem.If you look at it, its the same printer with a wireless card.They took it back for repairs and gave me a refurbished 8460 as a loaner, and guess what same problem.SO TAKE MY ADVICE, DO NOT PURCHASE BROTHER PRINTERS."
1,Poor quality printer,"I purchased this printer on June 22, 2007. One year later -- just after the warranty expired, the printer started making loud snapping sounds, like plastic being broken. At that same time, the printer started jamming and stopped printing. (I see that other people writing reviews have had the exact same experience.)While the printer worked for the first year, it constantly crumpled the corners of envelopes, creating a very unprofessional appearance. This, too, appears to be a common problem with this printer.I had an earlier version of this printer that lasted well for a number of years. However, in this model, the manufacturer appears to have cut corners and created a product that, in my opinion, is junk. Given the quick failure, I may end up suing the manufacturer to get my money back.I'll be replacing the computer today with something more reliable. Don't buy this printer."
5,Great SOHO printer,"We have used this all in one for the past 18 months at our preschool. It serves as both the fax machine and network printer for our staff. Occasionally it also serves as our backup copy machine when our primary copy machine breaks. In 18 months we have over 45,000 printouts and it still works like a champ. We use both Windows and Apples; set up was easy. We have not had any issues with it at all. I would definitely buy this again if I needed to. Very dependable."
5,Work like a Charm,"I purchased this printer after I had 2 inkjets to go belly-up on me. I was tired of the inkjet short longevity with the volume that we print at my house. I began looking around for a replacement MFC that was lasar. I also called the repair store that had worked on my previous 2 printers. The repair man recommended this printer. He was right on the money. This one prints great, has great speed, and was a breeze to set up. To get a BW laser MFC at this price for the what you get is an awesome deal."
3,"Not bad, not great.","Featurewise, it's a nice printer, network attached and can scan directly to network shares / email addresses using presets (without a computer plugged into it). On the bad side, I purchased three of these, and had issues the first week. The first one developed a clicking sound in the feed (though it works without errors), and the second one started generating a spurious error message and refused to print, indicating that the toner was exhausted (even with a new cartridge). The solution to this was a reset procedure not covered by the user's manual, and required a call to Brother (which had pretty decent support). I've had other Brother fax machines before, and they are usually pretty bulletproof."
1,Curling pages and will not pick up paper,"I absolutely hate this printer. I set it up and it worked fine. I have had it for 6 months. About once every 2 or 3 weeks this machine suddenly reads ""No Paper"" though there is paper in it and it is not jammed. There is a plastic clicking sound about 6 times in a row then the red light. If I power it down, then back up, stick my hand in the tray and scream curse words it might start working eventually. So far the shaking the printer, turning it off, sticking my hand in the tray and clicking things around while screaming expletives has worked, but yesterday it stopped working and none of this seems to help.Not enough of a problem for you? It curls the pages as I print them so that any document more than 4 pages long gets jammed if you do not pull the pages out and babysit it.Grossly overpriced for such a crappy mess. I'm uninstalling this and putting my HP printer back. BROTHER SUCKS!"
4,Drop Shorted,I really like the product however this item was drop shipped from TECH For Less LLC out of Colorado Springs Colorado. The problem I have is that they shorted me out of the Installation Disc for PC and the toner cartidge. After 2 attempts I have not heard back from them. Im hoping Amazon will help me procure the missing items out of this refurbished package.
4,Great Home Office Multi Function Machine,I love this machine. Works great networked with both my PC's and my Mac. Printed 50 copies of a document in the same amount of time that my inkjet would have taken to print 3. Crisp text. Came with a starter cartridge that I've been using for 2 months now. Only flaw - it crinkles envelopes a little when printing them.
2,DO NOT BOTHER,"I assume other printers/copiers must do their jobs better than this one. The quality of the output is fine but I have constantly had to clean the drum (done easily, admittedly). The two worst features are its inability to print envelopes--at least five creases per envelope on every try--and the print/copy output comes out very curled and winds up on the floor. This printer appears unable to copy/print more than ten pages without pushing it into a messy pile or all the way onto the floor. And did I mention the high degree of curling of the output (I did, but I will do it again). As a small business I will not buy a Brother printer-assuming they all share these faults (admittedly could be wrong). I will search another company's product line."
2,Basic instructional book at best.,"Very basic book that MAY be helpful to a home haunter, but if you serious about producing a haunted attraction, this book will be of little help to you. The book's drawings are simplistic and the description of props is somewhat vague, however, there are some basic technics that can utilized to create certain effects. The book's discussion of the finances of a haunted attraction is very limited and unimaginative. The use of actors to replace mechanical activation of effects is prominent in this book which leads me to believe that the authors financial skills are lacking( Labor cost & insurance are monumental hurdles in any haunted attraction). In general I would reccommend that you save your money on this one, the internet provides most of information in the book ""free for the asking""."
1,Laugh til you cry,"If you're looking for some cheap laughs, read this book. The other reviews have done well, but note: For Side-splitting vein-popping hysteria, get this book!Especially if you get the tape, you can tap into its insane goodness at any time of the day: during breakfast, driving to work, with a glass of port after dinner, or during your usual sessions of ritual merkaba meditations, whippings and chants.To believe this book you gotta believe a vast and intricate web of insane theories, spanning from aliens building the pyramids, atlantis, time-travelling....you see where we're heading.Although maybe not as funny as authors like Spike Milligan, this book still rates highly as a highly amusing piece of trash. New-age mumbo-jumbo, Phooey! You're not thinking outside the box, you're just thinking in Frissel's box, and you LIKE it!A great laugh, nix more than that."
1,This book proves that a person can write in a streightjacket,"I ordered this book after it was recommended by a band whose opinion I highly respect (Tool). Boy...this changed my opinion of not only the band but the gullibility of our society. The author points out a hodgepodge of wacky different conspiracy theories such as cattle mutilations, Flying Saucers under the earth, multiple dimensions, among many others. At which time he takes it upon himself to weave a complicated theory on how all the theories are connected. But of course any scientific proof is conveniently left out. The odds of any conspiracy being correct is very small, for this book to be correct ALL the conspiracy theories have to be correct. The Heaven's Gate Cult members would think this book is wacky. The bad news is that this book is a complete waste, the good news is that it might have been writen by the Church of the Subgenius making it a one big joke, in which case it is BRILLIANT!"
3,grammer,"I have counted two typos already, and I am only on page 14. Hard to take a book seriously that has typos and uses wikipedia for sources."
1,Beware,I don't like to say negative things but I bought this because of the positive reviews. I'm not saying don't buy it because obviously some people liked it. Think twice about it.
1,Error,I am not rating this because it is not what I though it was and am sending it back.Well it won't allow me to enter without a rating so 1 star.
1,Instructional Material?,"If you wan't a little entertainment from Lee, who is a master of his style this DVD is OK.Guitar Lesson; No!The licks are never sufficiantly slowed down to grab them and Lee looks like he wishes he was somewhere else.The guy interviewing him appears to be more of a fan than a host of the show.Printed instructional material consists of one page of the so called ""Blues Scale""Save your money on this one!"
5,WV Writers among the Finest,"This is a book well-worth the time it takes to read it, which is something that cannot be said of many books on the market today. Full of vibrantly-penned short stories and poems -- the kind that Jesse Stuart wrote and that become classics -- each holds the reader's interest from start to finish by grabbing his/her mind and heart and weaving it into the tale. Not being a native West Virginian, I'm free to say that Mountaineers take this writing business seriously, and as a result, aspiring writers can look to stories like the ones in this book as good examples of How to Write. If you're partial to downhome stories or smalltown life in coalmining regions or other stories along that line, buy ""Backcountry..."" you won't be disappointed."
1,Haven't I seen this information somewhere else?,"Ummm... yeah. There's nothing new here, particularly for those who are seriously trying to launch a new book or publication. This is nothing more than a re-package of tried and tested sales techniques that anyone with half a brain will already know.Sorry, folks, I was expecting much more than this for my hard-earned dollar."
3,Good book,"Nice history, but not quite enough history on some of the unique trends and technical differences in 20th century oboes."
1,Hate Hate Hate this cookware,"It's heavy, it mars the counters in your cupboards, it can't be cleaned in your dishwasher unless you want it to discolor. Also discolors in the presence of acidic foods, like tomatoes. If you ever scorch something, it can be very difficult to clean adequately. The pieces with the black handles can only go in an oven up to 350 degrees, so no browning foods in your broiler using the skillet. Did I say how heavy it is? It's heavy."
2,Not your Mom's Magnalite,"I ordered this pot to replace one that is about 25 years old and the handle broke. Although the pots are ""supposed"" to be the same size, my original USA made Magnalite looks like the big heavier brother to this new made in China Magnalite. Haven't used it yet but the dishes will be more limited as the new one has right at 1"" less depth and is not nearly as heavy as the old one. We'll see. Don't order this if you are expecting it to equal a vintage Magnalite pot."
5,Use it all the time!!!,I bought this pot for my mom as a gift. She bought me one for Christmas and I absolutely LOVE it. I have cooked spaghetti and a medium roast along with other meals using this pot. Definitley my most used pot. :)
1,not what we expected,"This was supposed to replace a 65 year old version. Although it looked the same, it turned out to be much heavier, and the sidewalls were much higher than what we knew as the classic fry pan. Thus it did not serve as an adequate replacement."
3,Quality difference between old and new,"OK - disclaimer . . . ""SuperMommy"" is a most-sarcastic nickname, as much as it's something I aspire to. Now . . .I DID NOT buy this set. Unless I am mis-reading the reviews, it seems the 5-star ratings are from people who already own a hand-me-down set made when the quality was higher; and the low ratings are from people who bought new versions. As with many other brands, the manufacturing race to low price means lower quality than we're used to, even with brands that used to be the gold standard.I would like all reviewers to be absolutely clear about whether they are rating an early version gotten elsewhere, or the most recent turn-out currently up for purchase via Amazon. That may explain the huge discrepancy between 5-star and 1-star ratings."
3,Slightly different walk down a familiar path...,"The Flower Kings have redefined fecundity to the point where taking a couple of years off might be a good thing for everyone. Paradox Hotel is a decent enough album with plenty, and I mean PLENTY to enjoy, however quantity runs a serious risk of overshadowing quality, as was the case with Flower Power. The strength of Paradox Hotel lies in the lyrics which never fail to capture my imagination and draw pictures in my head as I listen, and the music carries them along nicely enough. There is one track I find particularly engaging, Bavarian Skies. It's provocative and adventurous, something I expect in a good prog album. That aside, though, it feels like they're walking down the same path with just a different pair of shoes (and they're the only ones who would really notice the difference.) Even first class noodling is still noodling. It's time for another classic like Back in the World of Adventures or Space Revolver."
5,TFK did it again!,"As is the case with all Flower Kings discs that I've gotten (all but one as of now), the first time I heard this, it sounded like a jumbled bunch of nonsense.However, as if by magic, the next time I heard this, it sounded like something totally different and extremely melodic and brilliant.Each consecutive listen has made me more and more familiar with the melodies and the hooks that I've come to love from these guys.There are Yes, Genesis and Gentle Giant sounds throughout.If there's one thing that may be a bit of a negative, its what I consider to be an overuse of the Yes sound, both with the vocals on some songs, and Stolt's Steve Howe ish guitar work on some songs.After all is said and done, I Highly rcommended this, just like all the other FK offerings."
1,BEWARE!,Although this power adapter is advertised to be used with UA-767 apparently there are several variations of models with this number andthe UA-767V that I bought is battery operated only so I had to send the adapter back. CHECK MODEL SPECIFICATION CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY AN ADAPTER-- even if it says 'people who bought this also purchased...' or'buy these together'.
3,Dumb and Dumber!,Pretty consistent with the title. Funny if you are under the influence but dumb otherwise! Had never seen it before though.
1,No end,"I love this movie and have watched it many times. The problem here is that the movie stopped at 1:47:00, which means it was many minutes before the end of the actual movie. My son was watching it for the first time and he could not watch the end. What's the deal with putting a movie and cutting the end???"
5,can't do without this book,"This is the most essential book for the watercolorist. It will save the purchaser its price many times over. It also is indispensible in its ability to apply the phenomenonal research on paints and pigments to your works. There is enough to deal with in this fickle medium without having to figure out why paints behave how they do, why they misbehave, why they combine the way they do. Buying a plaint with poor quality ingredients can bite you back! But you can also save a lot of money because sometimes a lesser brand performs as well or better than the top-priced brands. That is where you can save money. The research is phenomenal, and its potential for lessening frustration and improving results is great. Buy this book."
2,Discoloration,I love Magnalite pots but my recent purchase of set has disappointed me. After first use of pots....the inside of pots turned black...I am so aggravated. My other sets have never discolorated to this extent. I tried reaching manufacture..no response.
4,"It was a gift, so . . .","I ordered this item for a Christmas gift, but being familiar with Magnalite and its quality, I'm sure it will be fine."
1,You get what you pay for,"A set of cookware for less than $500 is going to be a mistake. Like this stuff. People love these things, but I'm wondering if it's because they've not cooked with high-quality cookware. A good saute pan will cost almost $200. How in the world do you get an entire set for less without it being nothing but cheap metal that causes boilovers and has poor heat control and conduction?This was the worst cookware I ever used in my life. Fortunately I didn't spend my own money on it. It was given to me against my wishes, and I was cursed with using it until I could afford better. After throwing the stuff in the dumpster, I never looked back."
1,NOT the original Magnalite,This is a rip off of the original Magnalite cookware set. The original was made in regon and not China. The set was a terrible product that qwent black within a few weeks of using the product. strongly recomend NOT buyign the made in China set!
4,Supreme nostalgia!,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this vintage television footage, I was saddened to not have been given the opportunity to see these performances within their original context, i.e. an introduction by Ed Sullivan, Dick Clark, et al, to place the filmed segments into some kind of historical context. Hence, the less than five stars rating.That being said, it was wonderful to finally see and hear the original group with decent sounding vocal tracks. There has always been plenty of Diana Ross' solo material available on video but not the Supremes. The producer managed to get most of their top hits into this collection. If the sales go well for this program, perhaps we can look forward to a more comprehensive DVD in the future.In the meantime, if you like Diana, Mary, Florence (and later Cindy), you gotta have this DVD."
