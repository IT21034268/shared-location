1,A senseless childish unenjoyable book,I hope I like the other Goodkind books I've purchased. This one is a poor children's story.
5,Really Very Good,This is really a very good read. The quick pace keeps you engaged and the imagination generated is delightful. It is also surprisingly balanced by excellent character develment. I'm looking forward to reading the next one in the series.
4,Good Read,Goodkind really starts this series off in a great way. I have read the whole series and recently decided to re-read and Wizard's First Rule is my favorite of them all. Even if you never read the whole series this is good as a stand alone book.
5,Great book,"Excellent read!!! Didn't want to put it down, lots of surprises and twists!!! cant wait to start the second book tonight"
1,"Unnecessarily, inaapropriately graphic","After the first 200 pages or so, I was thoroughly enjoying this book. The characters were excellent, the plot exciting, and the adventure underway.With Richards' first use of the sword of truth, the graphic description was a little more than I prefer, but not enough to keep me from continuing.The description of the ""ceremony"" with Darken Rahl and a young boy, however, was WAY too much. With pedophilic references, followed by the torture, execution and canabalization of the boy, the author went too far me. I understand the authors intent to make the villain as evil as possible, but come on.....Anyway the book wsa instantly cast from my Kindle, never to return.Despite downloading and reading the free sample (first 3 or 4 chapters) there was nothing to indicate this type of graphic and disturbing content would follow."
1,"Poorly written, predictable, on of the worst I've ever read","I'll be brief as other people have said the same things. The book was very predictable. Not simply like much fantasy is, but worse. I had figured out far too much too soon. e.g. it was obvious that michael had been involved in George Cypher's murder, and that he was alligned with D'Hara. Diologue between characters lacked the fine tuning that I expect from an author. Much of the dialogue was juvenille. On the positive side, the next book does appear to be tighter."
2,stupid and childish,"This book got a lot of hype but I still cant figure out why. The plot seems to have been stolen from many previous works and the writing is just childish and bad. Don't waste your time trying to get into this series, find something better."
2,Could not get into this book,"Thought would be great, had really hard time getting into this book. Actually stopped reading this about 60% thru. Couldn't take it"
4,Wizard's First Rule,A little slow at the beginning but filled with lots of twists and turns. Especially liked the instances where you didn't see what was coming next - I won't ruin it for you by telling specifics!
1,Horrible book!,"Wizards First Rule was a horrible mess of a book. There was absolutely no charactur development, and I could really care less what hapened to them. Dont start this series because they are all aweful. Read books by J.R.R Tolkien, George R.R.Martin because those are much better written then The Sword of Truth series."
1,Horrible writing,"It has an interesting and inventive story but is executed poorly. The writing is so bad it makes me want to throw it into a fire. The only thing that keeps me going is the story. It is a shame that the editors didn't have enough guts to get the author to rewrite or bring someone else in to co-author. Case in point: When Richard is going to Zedd's house we are told that the ""old mans house was to far to reach before dark and the trail too treacherous to travel at night."" But when they leave the house 100 pages later, ""It was an easy trail, almost a road."" If this is not the same trail, then why not take it in the first place? This is a slight example of a regular occurrence. Don't start this book unless you want to know first hand what bad writing is."
1,Worst dialogue EVER.,"It really was painful to read.The plot was fine, despite being incredibly typical. The dialogue, however, was childish to the point of being absurd. Read any of the exchanges between the two main characters out loud and you'll see what I mean. Many passages where characters conversed in this book were so unrealistic they were unintentionally funny...NOT recommended"
5,Loved the series,"Enjoyed this series and love the new show legend of the seeker, it's what got me reading. Of course the books are way better than the show."
1,This book underwhelmed me,"I found reading this book. very tiresome. It was like their was 300 pages of story stretched out over 800 pages. The Characters were unconvincing and one dimensional. I predicted most of the plot twists, and i'm the kinda guy who never sees anything coming. The main antagonist was uninteresting and not really developed fully. Overall this book was a giant waste of time."
3,Thief!,"**Spoiler WARNING!**I admit, I mostly enjoyed this book. It was entertaining, decently written, and the pacing was fine.HOWEVER. Terry Goodkind does not have an original bone in his body. The entire book, in fact ALL of his ideas, are stolen from other sources.I'll give one example. A young man, living on a farm, meets a mysterious older man who takes him away and teaches him the ways of magic, while helping him find his magic sword, and confront the evil lord who turns out to be his father. Star wars, anyone?"
5,God Send,"This book is a god send to veteran readers of fantasy searching for a new and inventive series.I embarked upon this epic journey (now six books long and still growing)after reading all the current installments of Robert Jordan's seris,The Wheel Of Time and like Robert Jordan,Terry Goodkind offers a tale of massive scope while being a much easier world to enter.It starts simply;an uncomplicated young woodsguide,Richard Cypher living in quiet Westland with his grandfather is ambling through the forest-a favorite hobby-and is yet to discover that he is a very important man indeed.Although Goodkind makes use of this classic fantasy opener-young boy from country dicovers he is the man who will save the world,or not-where he takes this simple begining is far from unoriginal and his intricatly created world of magic is quite insightful.If you havent read this book yet,you have a wonderful lesson still to discover:Wizards First Rule."
4,Wizard's First Rule,I must say that this is one of the better fantisy books that i have read. The only reason that I this book did not receive the fifth star is because Goodkind showed a lack of imagination by stealing the basic plot from The Lord of The Rings. Lets take someone who just wants to be left alone and make them the hero of the story. Richard -> Bilbo Show what happens to someone if the magic is not used correctly. Samaul -> Smegal AKA Golum For gods sake Goodkind even made Samaul look and speak like Smegal.
3,Interesting and fun to read,"This is a fun series...getting a bit long and I think an attempt to rival Robert Jordan's equally lengthy series. Nontheless, the stories are a great break from the drudgery of life. jordan can create a world full of great imagination and a captivating plot.The characters are somewhat one-dimensional and at times the love story with Kahlan ventures into melodrama. I dont mind a good love story, but it gets a bit much sometimes.This is not really an epic, nor is it a classic, but it is one of the better fantasy series out there. Goodkind should really end it sometime though."
5,AMAZING,"All i can say is ..... WOW. with simple prace Terry Goodkind weaves a tale of romance, magic,and wonder. He includes, of course , an excellent bad-guy and keeps you on the edge with constant adventure, mystery and heartache. I love the way he writes and, having read many different epic fantasy series, i conclude that Goodkind is definately up there with Feist, Eddings and Jordan."
5,THIS IS GREAT!!!!!!!!,"If had the money I would produce the animation of these stories in their unabridged from just as these tapes are. I have just finished the 2nd in the series and have ordered the third. THESE ARE GREAT, exciting, well woven and masterfully written stories that need to be exposed to the world. I only wish I had the money to produce these stories in animated form, but i must be content in the fact that I can only buy these unabridged stories and enjoy them."
3,"Definitely not a ""must read"" but not an ""ignore me"" either.","This book is decent, but I certainly don't care enough for these characters or this world to continue on with the series. The story line is not terribly engrossing, but it is good. I liked these people, but they are not as dynamic as I would have liked. However, I don't dismiss this book as being horrible. I think you need to read it for yourself, but I also think it will wet your appetite for something a bit deeper."
5,Best book ever,"I never was really into fantasy, but when I started to read Goodkind's books I was hooked. The story grabs you and brings you along on the ride. It goes from adventure to romance. The characters become so real. You will never put the book down."
2,Had to stop reading it.,"The style of writing Goodkind employs allowed me to make quick progress through what I consider to be an interesting plot. However, I ended up throwing the book away because it is simply too gruesome, brutal and cruel. This book is very explicit, and what it doesn't spell out for you, your mind will, leaving you to shudder later as the images resurface. It's a shame, had it not embraced and dwelled on such terrible images I would have really enjoyed it."
1,Wooden and badly written,"Reading the reviews of this book leaves me mystified. Don't you people have any exposure to decent fantasy literature? Anyone who has ever read Tolkein would find this stuff pathetic and wooden, with characters that are one dimensional and plots that play like bad melodrama. There is so much good stuff out there, old and new--Ursula Le Guin, George R. R. Martin, Elizabeth Haydon, even Rowling, who writes for kids, writes with vastly more depth than this. Ickk. It's like pouring refined sugar in your brain."
1,Terry's First Rule - Readers are stupid.,"This book will appeal to readers who enjoy tediously-detailed expositions of sophomoric philosophy, weak and one-dimensional protagonists, and a novel written in the ""tell - excessively - don't show"" style. The action and outdoor scenes are unrealistic - I get the feeling that TG hasn't spent a night in the woods, is a virgin, and certainly hasn't been in any sort of scrum. It baffles me that this series has achieved such popularity, but also gives me hope - after all, if this drivel can sell, then all I need to do to make a fortune as a fantasy writer is catch a few monkeys and chain them to a keyboard for a month.Heck, this book is worse than ""Against the Giants"" by Ru Emerson, and that's saying something.I won't be reading the rest of the series, thank you very much...and I very much enjoyed both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged...those books were well-written (don't agree with all of the philosophy, but they work as novels)."
1,why???just...why???,"This is a horrible, god-awful book. I have no idea how it gets all these good reviews. I was only able to force myself through the first 1/3 of the book before tossing it aside in disgust. It was just bad. Everything about it was bad. Hated Richard. Hated Kahlan. All the characters were paper thin. The writing itself was ghastly...I could go on, but its just not worth my time and effort. Read George R.R. Martin if you want excellent, realistic fantasy."
3,traditional yet adequate fantasy reading,"This is certainly not the best fantasy novel I've read but it was entertaining. The draw of the story is the romance between the 2 main charcters which for unusual circumstances can't be in love. There is little consistency or ryhme/reason to the magic, a so-so plot, and few truly likeable characters. What it does have though is the great romance, wonderful action descriptions when richard uses the sword, and a very fresh sexual massicistic relation. Its a long novel and I will not read the remainder of the series but I do not rue the reading."
3,"Love, dragons and pain","The writing style of this book may not be amazing but I still felt like I was able to see the world that Terry Goodkind had envisioned. No this is not the best literary work out there, but I still feel like this book deserves a fair chance. The story is absolutely nothing like the show Legend of the Seeker, which I did like. The show follows a completely different story path than the book, but I feel like compared to the show I did like the book better.Yes, Richard seems like the unrealistic uber perfect two demential character, but there is a lot going on under the surface that makes this book so good. I do think that Richard and Kahlan's relationship is unrealistic, but in the end it works. Overall I would give this book 3.5 stars."
4,Fun & quirky!,"I really enjoyed this book and I was looking forward to reading the series - something like ten more? Well, my advice is to read this book but do yourself a favor and bypass the rest. After reading such a delightful book, I wonder how Terry G. could have gone so wrong with the subsequent books. Stop here."
4,Wizard's First Rule,"I am only half way through the first book of this series and am extrememly satisfied with the readablility of the book. It has kept me fully engaged, sometimes very hard to break away. I am planning to read the rest of the series."
2,Passable - But hasn't it been done before and better?,"Terry Goodkind really tried on this one....but it seems he fell extremely short. This book is the epitome of Fantasy 'been done before, should work again.' It is your typical hero, evil villian, 'oh, gee, if I don't save the world we'll all die'. <yawn> Besides that fact that the story line is tired, has anyone here read The Sword of Shannara by Terry Brooks? This Gookind drivel seems to be a sad, sorry re-write of the aforementioned book, which was written in the 1970's. Let's see, which came first? Gee....a wonder?"
4,Terry Goodkind is amazing!!!!,"One of my father's friends recommended the book to me, but at thetime I was busy reading Sci-fi. A month later, I saw it in the school Library, and was totally amazed. I thought that such works could only be produced by Tolkien, but I guess I was wrong. Two days after finishing the book, I bought Stone of Tears, then bought Wizards First Rule, then soon after, Blood of the Fold, (love the title). I then waited and waited until Temple of the Winds came out in paperback. I was lucky, I had just finished reading Blood when I saw that Temple of the Winds was out, I quickly bought it, and had it read by the end of the next day! If it wasn't the weekend, I know I would have missed school to read it!! Goodkind is the best new author I've read!"
5,Engrossing,Rarely do I find a book that keeps my interest going. This one does. One characteristic of Goodkind's writing is that you really empathize with the characters. I really felt the joy and anguish that Richard and Kahlan went through. Most books written only cover the surface of events and do not go to this level of emotion. I finished the first book within 3 days and immediately went out and bought the next 2 in the series. Well done!
2,Potential but Poor,"While this novel has all the right elements for a great fantasy story, it fails to follow through. The characters are weak, dialogue is terrible, and the ""deux ex machina"" rules and ruins the novel. While readable, it is neither enthralling nor a masterpiece. The author either tried to do too much or simply didn't do enough, however certain ideas and situations were interesting; resulting in a book with incredible potential but which fails completely to build a sustaining, intigruing, and original fantasy."
5,You either gonna love him or hate him.,"Well, for me its the former rather than the latter. Ive read almost every fantasy series I can get my hands on, including The Wheel of Time, the Mallorean, the Belgariad, the Elenium, the Tamuli, Most of Terry Brooks stuff, and of course, most of Tolkiens books as well. I have to say, Goodkind is my favorite fantasy artist. There are many paralells with Jordans work especially, but Goodkind does something that Jordan does not: Actually makes his characters DO something. They dont just sit in the same place for three books, the action is very fast-paced. I cared about the characters, and always wanted to see what happened next. I guess Ill put it this way. The Temple of the Winds (the fourth book in the series) is the only book Ive bought in Hardcover in the last two years. If a slightly higher level of violence and sex dont offend you, read this book. I think you'll enjoy yorself."
5,Equally Great,"Lovers of Jordan will throughly enjoy this novel. The similarities are sometimes obvious, but are hardly dissappointing. The characters are enchanting and the detail throughout the entire novel will keep you begging for more as you rush to buy Stone of Tears (next in the series)!"
5,best book i've read in a long time...,"There aren't many books that got me hooked the way Wizard's First Rule did. One of the top five books I've ever read, its an easy read but very detailed and enjoyable."
5,This book is really intence and has great fantisy storyline.,"This is a great book for all you fantisy lovers out there. I loved this book because every time you think one thing is going to happen another problem comes up. I also love this book because it is filled with magic, wierd creatures, and a forbiden love. So if you love those things I think this wiould be a great book for you to read."
1,Frighteningly Bad,"I'm not sure which is worse: this pathetic excuse for a novel, or the college English professor who wants to make it part of his school's curriculum. Rarely have I had the misfortune of stumbling upon such a poorly written, hopelessly unoriginal and strikingly un-interesting fantasy novel. Readers who like this novel should try Terry Brooks, too. Neither he nor Goodkind has any handle on how to write a decent novel.Thank goodness I don't have to go to that English professor's college. Yikes."
5,A great book that kept me on the edge of my seat,"I thought this was an excelent book. It is the type of book that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I just coudn't put it down. It has been a long time since I have read a bood this good. I look forward to reading his other books. I am right now in the middle of ""Stone of Tears"", which is also a great book from this author"
1,One extreme or the other,"I personally thought this book was awful. Even by skimming over large parts of it, I couldn't finish it. There seem to be two extremes in terms of the reviewers of this book. There are those that loved it and those that loathed it. It seems to depend on what type of reader you are. If you are new to fantasy, its entirely possible you'll enjoy this novel. If you're a regular reader, you'll find it extremely annoying. Its a hack job with no depth to it. If you don't care about continuity or character development, you may enjoy it anyway."
1,The audio version cuts WAY too much out of the story,"I took audio version out of the library, and it was enough to get me to buy the book, but alone it was awful. There were gaps in the story which left the characters' motivations extremely unclear. Read the novel, but forget the tape"
2,Poorly Written,"The first time I tried to read this book, I got to the third chapter and just couldn't take anymore.A few months later, I was hungering for a good fantasy book and tried again, figuring that so many people couldn't be wrong about a series...could they?Alas, they could. Every page I kept telling myself, ""It's got to get better! It's got to get better!"" The characters were two dimensional, the situations were unimpressive, and the dialog was like something from a dime-store novel. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't suspend my disbelief, and I couldn't care about the characters.I finally gave up around chapter 10 or 11. Maybe someday I'll try again, but I wouldn't count on it.If you aren't looking for good literature, but just a wild ride, then perhaps this is a decent book. If, on the other hand, you want something you can be proud of having read, look elsewhere. It's not the worst book I've ever read (hence two stars, instead of one), but it comes close."
2,deus ex machina used liberally,"The ideas are interesting, the writing is passable, but the plotting, oh God the plotting!Someone has got to talk to the author and tell him that it's bad practice to depend on plot gimmics like deus ex machina in practically every single chapter.No matter what happens in the book, no matter what mountain the hero has to climb, some as yet unknown feature of this world appears to save the day, usually manifesting as some hidden magical talent that the hero posseses that he (or anyone else) never knew he possesed and that he somehow masters instantly to save himself and the rest of the world.Sorry, I can't recommend this book. If you want to read good fantasy, read Guy Gavriel Kay or Orson Scott Card."
1,Terrible writing and poor taste,"This book has sections that are downright pornographic, and in the worst way. (Kids -- no excitement, just trash). I've thrown away only a handful of books in my lifetime, but this was one of them."
3,Okay,"This book was a bit too much of the typical fantasy novel with the all powerful bad guy and the band of merry men who have to find a way to stop him. Despite it's 800 or so pages, I finished it very quickly, not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was so simple that I didn't have to think about what I was reading. That isn't too say it didn't have any redeeming qualities. It was entertaining enough for me to want to finish it, but was definately along the lines of easy summer reading."
2,Painful read,I'd had enough after the first hundred pages. Just couldn't believe in the world or care about the characters. Luckily I've found several other much better series to read.
1,My 4-year-old could write better,"I stuck with the book till I couldn't any longer...at which point it became the first book I have ever thrown across the room. The plot was interesting, the characters were interesting, but the writing was so horribly done I could not stomach it anymore."
1,long and badly written,"This book (and series) has a lot in common with Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Like Jordan, Goodkind has a very detailed context worked out for his plot, and a very elaborate and detailed plot worked out as well. But Goodkind magnifies Jordan's principal fault: bilgewater prose. In Jordan's case, the poor writing is at least ignorable. But Goodkind's prose is so awful that it calls constant attention to itself. One minor, but indicative, index of a fantasy author's skill is the ability to come up with good proper nouns: names of people and places. The sheer awkwardness and silliness of Goodkind's invented names is a clear mark of his tin ear for language."
2,"""The chicken that was not a chicken...""","Terry Goodkind knows how to write a page-turner. I'll give him that. But not much more. If you're reading this review, you've heard it before: Goodkind is a horrible writer. I wouldn't say horrible; but certainly a bad writer. Even then, I don't mind bad writers. I read bad writing all the time. What I refuse to read, however, is work from writers who refuse to let a story tell itself, and instead force the story through a philosophical mold in their head to the detriment of the reader's enjoyment. But I won't go into the details about that. What I will say, though, is that life is too short to read thousand-page novels where the author, with an apparently perfectly straight face, writes about a ""chicken that was not a chicken."" It's not the absurdity of it. I love absurdities. It's the colossal amount of cheek he must have to write this garbage. To sum it up, Goodkind is a freak. And this book is a freak's book."
2,Not GOOD enough,"I saw the tv show first and was eager to read the book (The more Sword of Truth the better, right?). I found the book mostly interesting, but became disappointed when Mr. Goodkind started turning the story into erotic fantasy. There was also far too much emphasis on the bad guys and the terrible things they did to people. I find it insulting when people say that Terry Goodkind is as good as Tolkien. Tolkien didn't need to feed people's guilty pleasures to write a world famous and beloved epic; why did Mr. Goodkind? I'm very disappointed because there IS a lot of the ""good stuff"" in Mr. Goodkind's ideas. He could have made a masterpiece, but he didn't. :("
2,Worse Condition than Expected,"I knew when I ordered this item that I would not be getting a pristine, new copy. I frequently order used books. But this book came in the mail in worse condition than I expected. The first 100 pages or so are so stiff that I'm afraid to open them for fear of completely breaking the spine. The plastic, library-like dust jacket is, frankly, kind of gross. I would not order from this retailer again."
3,"Good story and pacing, but could use some better editing.","Ok, so, by the end of the book I was really tired of Terry Goodkind's endless OCD need to circle around his paragraphs. He'd start out a paragraph and basically end it, or the second paragraph below, just repeating the same sentence almost word for word. Despite that I still enjoyed the book enough to decide to continue on with the series.Richard started off as a blank slate to me, generic hero material, but really grew on me after half way into the book. Kahlan was mostly the same way. The stand out characters were Zedd and Darken Rahl. Zedd was a blast to read about and Darken was one of the better villains I've read. So in that respect it was worth the read and I hope he gets his writing kinks out in the next books of the series. And, of course, being a Ayn Rand fan, I'm interested in seeing how he uses her philosophy in the books to come."
5,BEST SERIES EVER.,"The book is so good they even made a TV series on it called ""legeng of the seeker"". This is the kind of series you will read 2 or 3 or 27 times. I like it so much I actually buy it FOR OTHER PEOPLE just so I can then talk about it with them. This book was actually the first book I ever read without being forced and i've been reading ever since. No lie!"
5,The best book I have ever read!!!!!,"Terry Goodkind has created the most excellent and intriguing book I have ever read! Whether you love or hate this book, I guarentee that you will be pulling your hair out in some parts with anxiety over what will happen to the characters. The personalities Goodkind develops for them make you care about what happens to them. There is surely a character that everyone will take to heart. Especially Zedd. I find it impossible to believe that anyone would hate Zedd! He's hilarious! The plot is well thought out, the characters are heartwarming.....if you like fantasy, this book is a MUST HAVE!! And if you read it and didn't like it, all I can say is, ""What be the matter with your eyes?"""
3,Should Goodkind be hanged or heralded?,"Okay, okay, he copies. Who doesn't! Life goes on, books come and go. These stories are meant to pass the time. Richard and Kahlen (while certainly sappy) embark on an interesting tale. Maybe Rand al'Thor will drop in (I don't think Goodkind would go that far), but in any case, this story is not completely unoriginal, if you consider some of the gruesome happenings (mentioned over and over and over again). In the end, it's a page-turner, IF you are willing to forgive Terry for his crime of being similar to other fantasy writers."
5,WONDERFULLY INTRIGUING!!! ONE OF THE BEST!!!,"People who rated this book lower than 5 ( mabye even 6 or 7), I can honestly say that you have no taste. though he may not be as good as Tolkien, he is certinly close. we're all entitled to our opinions, but how could you this wonderful book 1!?!?!?! It's not as bad as that. not only were the characters well developed The plot was one of the best i've read in a long time. The only thing I can say bad about this book is that Goodkind spent too much time on Denna"
3,Best book I ever read? Come on!,"For all those people out there who are saying that this series is ""the best ever"". Either you haven't read very many books, or you don't know what *good* writing is.Read some of the *good* authors out there: Robert Jordan, L.E. Modessitt Jr., Lois McMaster Bujold, Mercedes Lackey, Anne McCaffery, Tanya Huff etc. etc.This book is FLUFF - kind of like a trashy romance novel, or a good, ""First Fantasy"" novel for teenagers.But folks, there's a lot of better authors out there!"
2,Uneven adolescent adventure,"Goodkind's engaging tale of moderately interesting characters is seriously marred by a lack of rules about the world he has created. Most often the struggles resemble an afterschool adolescent magical card battle in which the play of an enchanted sword card is countered with ""Well I have a magic locket which changes your sword into..."" but the original player responds ""But I have a secret power that turns your locket into just its opposite."" Since anything is possible, the reader is eventually overwhelmed by the sense that Goodkind is just making up the rules as he goes along."
3,Good book,"I read this book years ago before I read Jordan's books. It is still fun to listen to, but wow did he copy all of Jordan's ideas?"
4,Wizards sleeve,"This book may not have a unique premise for like other reviewers have mentioned this is classic fantasy. An unlikely hero against all odds trying to defeat an evil entity. This book is very readable since people have questioned how its terrible writing or that its just plain bad but its not. The first chapter is the hardest to get through and once you get through that, you will not stop. Its a page turner and the entire series is not only about conquering evil its about a love that cannot possibly be allowed. The entire series is a struggle, torture, blood, gore, and war. It has everything you could want in a series with very believable and real characters."
2,Defininately not George R. R. Martin...,"** spoiler alert ** For shame! I read this book after having seen Legend of the Seeker which is based on the series of novels, and I can say I think I liked the tv series better.The main character is such a Mary Sue! He gets the crap beaten out of him, has magical anger issues, and becomes an unwilling (willing!) slave in a BDSM hookup with a Mord-Sith, yet by the end he's all peachy keen.Really?It must be the partitioned brain of a Seeker.Ugh, what horrible character writing.Kudos, for keeping me entertained, but that's it."
3,"Great story, weak writing","I haven't read any of the other books in this series, yet. I plan on doing so. This was a great story. The characters were a little cookie-cutter, but nonetheless enjoyable. The writing was obviously from someone who hadn't written a novel before. It made it hard to really get into the book, but all-in-all, it's pretty good for a first try!I haven't read the Wheel of Time series, but am starting the first book real soon. I can compare this to George R. R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series, however. Fire/Ice is much more well written with much more unique and interesting characters. However, I like that Wizard's First Rule wraps up the story whereas the Fire/Ice books just keep going and continue to unravel plot lines instead of tying them up.Definitely good fantasy and I hope that the writing improves over the series."
4,Glad I didn't read the reviews before I bought it,"Wizard's First Rule was the first book I read by Terry Goodkind. I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I bought it because I loved it. I found myself totally lost in the story. The book has lots of action which kept my attention and enough suspense to keep me turning the pages. I do agree with some of the criticisms. I just don't think the flaws were as bad as some of the reviewers make them out to be - certainly not enough to keep it from being a good read. My 4 stars are for the action and the suspense. However, I will keep the criticisms in mind because I'm relatively new to this genre and if there is better stuff out there then I certainly want to read it too."
1,Please stab me in the face with a soldering iron,"Terrible book: 820 pages of crying, rape,childish forbidden love,pyrophobia, ""You the biggest/meanest/smartest/most beautiful/etc person Ive ever seen"" , ""You are a very rare/special person Richard"". Oh and the worst thing is ""The Wizard's First Rule: People are stupid"". Come onnnnnnnnn."
1,One star for my masochism,"This and the other books are terrible. Sure, the story has decent pace and is engaging enough at first, like a typical mindless TV sitcom or drama series. A lot of people like them and I can't figure out why. Formulaic, cliched, contrived, etc. Nothing really original, but that wouldn't be so bad if it was done well.I only gave it 1 star because I tortured myself through 3 of these books I think. I left them in utter disgust as I did the wheel of Time series. One crisis always begets a solution, which creates another problem, and thus, another problem creating solution. Frying pan, fire, frying pan, fire, ad infinitum..."
2,Mediocre writing,"I tried. I really tried to get through the weak writing and concentrate on the story. But all the time I could only think ""I could have written this junk."" The story was okay, but the writing was mediocre...at best."
2,Goodkind's apparent writing strategy,"Maybe if I fill my novel with enough gratuitous violence, readers will not notice my lack of talent.Wizard's First Rule: people are stupid. Evidently, Mr. Goodkind feels the same way about his audience.For many years, I tried writing science-fiction and fantasy. Because I know it is not easy to create a good story, I usually give published authors a wide latitude. Especially on a first novel. Unfortunately, I have trouble forgiving Goodkind. I have the second novel, but I am not eager to read it."
3,A fantasy that will leave you wanting more,"""Wizard's First Rule"", while daunting to readers with tiny text and complex themes, is a novel no fantasy lover can go without. Once a simple woods guide, we see the main character flourish and to storyline thicken with turns and twists and desires unknown to us until the last second. The fast-paced beginning gives way to a journey made for the movies. I give it 5 stars and a heart-felt ""Hazah!"""
5,=^_^=,"The sword of truth novels are by far the best fantasy books i have ever read. i just finished the Faith of the Fallen, and i love it even more! Great books!!"
5,One of the Best Fantasy Series Ever!,"You guys that downed this book must not be paying attention very good. Goodkind explains the concept of magic very well by using the additive and subtractive concepts. Neither kind of magic is good or bad like the one guy stated in his review, its just that the subtractive magic is mostly used by the evil characters. But if you read the next books you learn more about the magic and then understand it. Goodkind did a very good job on keeping you wanting to read more and more. He made you actually care for the characters and what happened next. If you read this one and enjoyed it, you will want to read the others."
1,too predictable,"I read this book awhile ago and a friend recently asked to borrow it from me. I gave it to her. I got through the first book barely and a couple chapters into the secound book I just gave up. This book was so predictable, and not in the ""wow I want this to happen"" way. The main characters were way overdone and not at all interesting. I just couldn't find anything I enjoyed about the book when it was done."
3,The book was good but many typos.,"Don't get me wrong, the book itself is very good and well written,I'm just sorry I didn't pirate this book. At least that way I would have ways of correcting the many typos I found in this Kindle edition. With DRM there's no way of correcting bad spelling, grammar, punctuation, omitted periods, commas, etc., or whatever the editors missed. I wish there was a way to get my $3.99 back. If I want a book filled with typos and other errors I'll just write one myself. I'm not sure I'll be buying anymore DRM books. Sorry."
3,"Slow start, but worth sticking through it","The book starts ok, has some VERY rough spots in the middle, and really improves at the end. I'm no prude, but the ""sado-erotic"" scenes are WAY overdone and drag on way too long (and I don't agree with the review that they are ""integral to the story."")They make you feel like the author Goodkind is playing out some strange forbidden fantasy of his own, and you feel that the book becomes more trash than good fiction for a while.It does, however, get a lot better, and you want to keep reading. Certain characters and story lines are particularly interesting and unique. Definitely stick with it until the next book, which is greatly improved."
4,Good First Book - Terrible Series,"I really enjoyed this book when I read it over 5 years ago. However, each book that comes after gets progressively worse and worse. The last 2 books were barely readable.I give 4 stars to the book, but zero stars for the author. Terry Goodkind as a person has proven time and again through interviews that he could care less about his readers and fans.Still, I can't fault the first book for the author being a complete jerk."
2,Pretty bad,"I started reading this book when my brother highly recommended it. The first thing that struck me was how junvenile the writing style was. It read like it was written by an eleventh grader. Now, to be honest, I had just finished reading the fire and ice series by George R.R. Martin, and his writing style is awesome. As I continued reading, the storyline was so basic and predictable it was silly. About half way through I had to just put the book down, I couldn't waste any more time. If you are 15 and this is your first novel you may like it."
3,"Heavy on ideology, light on plot","I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, but only barely.If you're looking for a rollicking swords and sorcery adventure, this isn't it. If you're looking for elegant prose and complex characters, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a primer on Objectivist philosophy that would make Ayn Rand herself proud dressed in the guise of a mediocre fantasy tale, then you've found your book.The entire book is marred by Goodkind's stubborn insistence on shoving his personal philosophy to the forefront rather than using it as a backdrop against which to tell his stories. Anyone in a position of authority is evil, all the villains are vegetarians, and the only vaguely LGBT characters are all sadomasochistic parodies. All that aside, there is fun to be had reading this book, especially during the all-too-brief action sequences which are the only ones that remain relatively free of sermons on the virtue of ambitious self-advancement and the evil of social obligation."
4,"Good, but Brutal","I picked this up on Amazon during their Kindle Summer promotion for a great price, $2.99. I've been meaning to read these for quite a while now anyway, so this was a bonus.I enjoyed this quite a bit. But I'm having a hard time saying I loved it. The main reason is the author was just so darn brutal to the main characters. There were torture scenes that just drug on and on. Maybe I'm just too squeamish for something like that, but it really detracted from my overall enjoyment.I did think the writing was top notch, and Goodkind did a great job of world-building. By the end I was pretty engulfed in the universe he created. I particularly enjoyed his magic system. So if you don't mind some nasty torture scenes, then pick it up. Me, I'm debating on whether or not I'll read the rest in the series."
1,"You're a very special person, Mr. Cypher","I've cleaned out shelves in many a library and bookstore, mostly science fiction, but my fair share of fantasy. Why does this book irritate me so? Because to read such escapism, you have to have some plausible shred of hope -- however slight -- that you could be the hero. This book lays it on so heavily that the protagonist is ""a very special person"" that it makes me feel like I'm drowning in high fructose corn syrup!It's the antithesis of Joseph Campbell's hero of a thousand faces. What is Cypher's primary virtue? Perserverence, tenacity, maybe love? Nope. Genetics. The moral of the story: don't go into the woods on an epic quest, unless you were born it. Give me Tolkien any day, where the hobbits asked themselves ""why me?"" because they were ordinary mortals playing a part is big things.I guess that's why I find this book so offensive. It devalues the heroic struggle of ordinary people in turbulent times. And that isn't fantasy; it's how history is written."
5,Mr. Goodkind is Very Good and extremely Kind!,"Now I can't say I have alot to compare this novel to, but none the less, this is by far the best book i've ever read. Immediately upon completion, I went out and got part II. I'm hooked, Terry Goodkind, atleast for myself, hit the nail right on the head. If your a fantasy buff, you love this title."
4,Good but bears very similar to other exceptional fantasy,"I enjoyed GoodKind's ""Wizard's First Rule.""But Iwas shocked at the similarities between this book (among others inthis series) and Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. At times, Goodkind's style seems to mimic Jordan's so closely that I knew what the next chapter would hold.I am disappointed...Goodkind's books are a close second behind Jordan's amazing fantasy."
2,Something about it . . .,"I can't decide if I continued reading this book because I had no others handy (read it at the in laws), or because I was caught up in something about it. The writing leaves something to be desired, and the characters really annoyed me for the most part--I didn't care one whit whether they lived or died. Yet the action and the pace were pretty good--engrossing on some level. The torture scenes with the S&M mistress were awfully exploitive, but upsetting nonetheless. However, my one underlying thought while I read this book was ""Dear God I hope the story ends because there is no way on earth I could read 3 more books of drivel like this!"" Luckily, it does end, so you could read the first book and never pick up Goodkind again."
3,Mark Twain would roll over in his grave.,"Mark Twain as we all know, was a good story teller, and yes you can be a good story teller without gory details. I found that there were very morbid parts of this book that were quite unnecessary to tell a story. Sad comment on much of our society today, instead of food for thought the media gives us moral terrorism through shocking perversions. A good story teller can tell a story that needs no shock value. Mark Twain would roll over in his grave if he read this book. The book is mostly good just needs a bar of soap put in it's mouth. Or as in the book, moltin hot burning lead."
2,Sub-Tolkein-esque sequel generator,"I've had this book lying around for a while now, and only brought myself to read it recently. Perhaps I've a little premonition in me somewhere, 'cos it turned out that I was right to be wary. From the start I found the principal characters irritating, and this was not helped by the sheer predictability of the storyline. Well-written it may be, but Tolkein-esque is almost too gentle a word for the plot.I won't go into all the ""spot the Tolkein reference"" passages, but if I were Gollum, I would be phoning my lawyers. There were several nice ideas scattered about through the book, but I found myself constantly put-off by the whinging of the principals, and their interminable agonising over their actions. All this, coupled with an ending that just seemed to materialise out of the need for a trilogy, means that I won't be following this one up, I'm afraid."
2,Wow. Even more overrated than Jordan.,"This book made me angry. Fifty pages in, I thought it might be good; three hundred pages in, I realized he doesn't write all that well; five hundred pages in, I realized there was no nuance nor shading to any of the principle characters, and that they were boring; six hundred pages in, I realized I was reading a sequence of disjointed scenes and passages that had no bearing on anything; eight hundred and twenty pages in I relaized what a sucker I was for wasting all this time.I think if a lot of the people below read books other than of the fantasy genre (and not Tom Clancy or John Grisham), they'd see there's not much to this guy."
1,This story could have been told in 10 pages,"After finishing the last (dutch translated) Feist, a (former??) good friend of mine advised me to read this book. An outstanding book, he guarenteed me. How wrong he was indeed. The characters are flat, the story has been told dozens of times before. If this had been a short, conan like, story, it would heave been okay, not more, perhaps even less. I finish what I start and this is the sole reason why I finished the book. PLease terry pick up your former profession, whatever it was. I do have to admit that the Sid morth part was pretty kinky."
5,Terrific!,"Terry Goodkind writes an awsome story that involves: great characters, great storyline, and lots more! Richard Cypher (Rahl) and Kahlan Amnell (The mother confessor) set out to stop the D'Haran Ruler Darken Rahl. This book had me on the edge of ym seat the whole time! It is beautifully written and Terry Goodkind has my praise. Read this one and then continue on with the rest of the series!"
5,Best series I've read,"My wife reads those 300 page large print christian romance garbage novels, but I persuaded her to try this one and she is hooked. I started by reading the fourth book in the series, but when I was about half way through it I just went and bought all the rest of them because Goodkinds writng is so good. I read them all straight through and am looking forward to reading them again."
4,excellent,"the best thing in this book is the grounwork it lays for the second and third books.in this book i finally get the sense of magic as not a great force that it's fun to have, but as a fearsome and terrifying force that misuse of it, can cause horrific catastrophe.in this book we learn the first rule of wizards and then we see it's manifestation in the action that the heroes take.we see clearly that every action has a consquence which the heroes must be aware of.the only bothering thing in this book is richard's overly perceptive mind, and his overly confident manner, like when he tricks the mud people into avoding marriage.in all the book is a great read, and good thinking book as well, which is more than the usual fantasy books which are mainly action and motives.one of the best of it's kind."
1,Awful,"Along with blatant ripoffs from Jordan, this is one of the most cheesy and badly written fantasies I have ever read. The plot line is ridiculous, the dialogue corny and unrealistic, and the characters are completely unlikeable. This series is truly one of the most overrated that I have ever come into contact with, and I would suggest to everyone not to waste their time on this pointless drivel."
2,"I disliked the book in most ways, but it did have some good.","When i first picked up this book, i was fairly excited - the plot line looked good, and the writing style exciting, but the more I read, the less i liked it. It took me more than 200 pages to get to the point where I didn't want to throw it down and walk away from it. The writing style was not smooth, there were sudden changes in the character that came out of nowhere with no character delvelopement, and, at times, the writing seemed amost childish. The plot did turn out quite well, and I am willing to give the author a break because it is one of his first books. The potential that the book had is the reason that I have gone on and read his other books. He has improved in his writing with them. I only wish that he had spent more time making this book worth the read."
2,"Poor character development, unbelievable interactions","I found Richard Cypher's character unbelievable. The fact that he was written to have lived his life (up until the story) as a level headed, easy-going and likeable man makes it difficult to swallow such a profound change in personality taking place in such a short time. Also the interaction between characters shows errors of pace. Realistic adult interactions show that friendship and love develop over time. It seemed Richard and Kahlan were melting each other's hearts within several hours of meeting. This is the type of development and interaction that I would expect to see in a young readers' book. The storyline is actually decent, although his style is a little distracting; it does not flow smoothly."
1,Mindnumbingly boring,"This book drags on forever. I kept hoping things would pick up, but they never did. Good for sitting on the beach if you need a nap...use it as a pillow. The storyline is juvenile. I would have enjoyed it in high-school, but don't today."
1,"Not My Kind of Fantasy, Should be Horror Instead","I read the first book Wizard's First Rule and was enjoying it until I got to the part where a child was put in a hole to his neck and uspeakable things done to the child by the final page of his story (the child's), approximately 32 pages later. This is not what I call fantasy it is and was at the time I read it too too much like the awful reality of what happens to missing children and truly believe that this author's work belongs in the Horror section not the Fantasy section of all booksellers. I attempted to advise officials in this industry who did not care and were more concerned over profits vs. children. He has the right to write this but it belongs Horror. - Sandra"
1,"Boring, trite, repetitive, simplistic",Oh dear. Having just finished the Robyn Hobb Liveship seeries I looked for another series to start reading. This time I wanted to go with something that was largely published so I didn't have to wait between installments. Now I won't have to. This book and the second in the series were complete shockers.Save your money.Rob
4,So far really good book,"Bought the whole series after I started watching the TV show ""Legend of the Seeker"". So far so good."
5,Better than you think,"I thought this was a good book. It's easy to read, has easy to like characters and the plot is not to difficult to discern. Read it for yourself, develop your own opinion, and you may find that you like the book better than you thought you would."
1,Sword of Truth series book 1 audiobook,"The product is great. The delivery of this retailer was poor at best. Two weeks late and arrived crushed in a girl scout cookie box. Not the best advertisement for a resale. Oh well, what to expect..."
4,very good book!,exciting and interesting storyline--I'm hooked!! The characters are very real and believable. I enjoyed this book very much and have started reading the second one.
3,Don't Forget the Prequel,"I had a hard time getting into this. It took me awhile to get everyone straight and to figure out what was going on. Once I did, I enjoyed it very much. The rough start could have been helped if I had read the prequel BEFORE I read this one. But alas, I failed to do that and didn't pick up the prequel until I had closed the curtain on book #1. There is a formula that books in this genre follow, this one was no different, but I enjoyed the journey to the same old story/plot/ending. I will try book two of this series as well."
2,ugh,"i wanted to try this series TWICE, but each time, i just couldnt get past the part in the book where Richard gets the sword and can only use it with hate, or hate is one of the ways to use the sword. I'm sorry, but there's just something wrong when a good character needs to use hate in order to bring about justice. doesn't anyone else see that?twice i couldnt get past that part of the story to see if the rest was good. up to that point, the story was quite good, and grabbed my attention. it was well written. but comon, get rid of hate man!"
1,Hated It - Disturbing and Grotesque,"I was so hoping for something a little better than the Robert Jordan I had been reading lately, and bought this based on the Amazon.com reviews. This book seemed to get off to a good start but then just fell apart. The plotline seemed contrived and thin, and to top it all off, near the end of the book things take a violent and disgusting twist..."
1,This book is way offensive...,"I'm a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi novels, with some of my favorites like the Shannara series. But this book is simply too graphically offensive for my tastes. At one point in the book the author goes into great detail describing how the villain murders a child, smashes his brains, cuts off his genitals and eats them! I'm sorry but that's a bit too much."
1,not worth reading,"Alright, I didn't read the english edition but thegerman. There it is published in two parts. I readthe first one and didn't like it very much. Since I normally read a book til the end, I thougt of reading the second part, I started reading and just gave up on the third page. I don't mind a book that isn't very original, as long as it is well written, and this one isn't."
4,"Pretty good, very copycat","I liked the story--the characters are rich and the plot rather involved, but it's very like SW or something Eddings wrote.The kid gets a magic sword...sounds like Garion. The ol' wizard turns out to be related to the kid....""Luke, I am your father""Good vs. Evil...Easy to write about. Hard to write originally about. Everything seems like other books."
2,Characters cliched just like the world,"Yes, the world of WFR is heavily cliched, but so are thecharacters. What makes Richard any different from FrodoBaggins, Rand Al'Thor, or Garion besises a few trappings Goodkind layed on him? What distinguishes Kahlan from any other mysterious heroine? What keeps Chase from blending into Aragorn or Lan? What is the difference between Zedd and Gandalf or Belgarth? Sure, Goodkind can tell the stories of OTHER charcters clothed in new names, but he can't throw in any of his own."
2,Might have been a good book 20 years ago,"I usually don't comment on books I didn't like, but Iwas expecting something more than I got out of _Wizard'sFirst Rule_. It's just an adventure story, warmed-over Tolkien--period. No subtext, no human-feeling themes, no panache. Twenty years ago when _everyone_ wasn't writing pure high fantasy, it might have fit in--but we've gone beyond that now, and Goodkind is lagging. He may make money, but I doubt anyone takes him as seriously as they would Stephen Donaldson or William Gibson. When it comes down to it, this book was just plain empty."
2,Writing &amp; Plotline poor,"I give this book a 3. It's not the worst I've seen, butit's worse than most. The writing just doesn't grab me.It's too hacklike and I can't actually SEE anything he describes. Also, the plot is WAAAAY too derivative. It's just a matter of good vs evil, with no special twists thrown in. It's not really intelligent. It's just boring, mostly."
1,Still waiting for the good part,"After turning away from Jordan's WOT (3 books read), I've looked for another 'good' sequel. Reading the first 100 pages of Wizard's 1st Rule was a pain. Goodkind's writing is unimaginative, bad written and single minded. He needs about 250 pages to shift from one plot to 'another'. His fantasy leads to good laughs ... do you know the difference between a 'long-tailed gar' and a 'short-tailed gar'? The short-tailed counts his blood-flies ... argh ... often you think he's joking - but Richard can always count on his 'sausage', 'spice soup' and 'rightfull anger filling him with wrath' :( Don't waste your time with this book!"
1,Originality????,"If I can see the ending 500 pages away as I could withthis book, there's really no point in reading it. Better toget drunk...it kills less braincells. Really, these kinds of books are filled with stupidity and childish morality. If it's not original, why not just go and read all the other works the author copied from? 99% of the time the author who copies as much as Goodkind doesn't translate the copied device/character/etc. with as much power as the original had. When I learned Darth Vader was Luke's father, it was shocking ...when I found Darken Rahl was Richard's, I laughed."
1,Unreadable,"I admit, I picked up my copy of WFR as ""something to read between Jordan books."" I was hoping to find at least a little bit of good reading in the meantime. Maybe I had Robert Jordan on the brain when I began reading because I was simply appaled by the sophmoric writing here. As a story-teller, Goodkind is passable. But as a writer, he is poor. Awful would be a better description, but I'm trying to be nice. Goodkind does not describe the events, he reports them. ""He walked over to the table. He picked up the knife. It was a sharp knife. He walked over to the window, and looked out. It was dark."" Writing like has no flow, no sweep. I find a choppy writing style unreadable. Here is the same group of sentences, but better. ""Walking over to the table, he picked up the razor-shapr knife and peered out of the window into the darkness."" It's difficult to comment on Goodkind's plot and characterization when he presents it so poorly. Therefor, I give this book an F-."
1,Pages and pages of nothing!,"If you want to read great fantasy or if you just want to impress your friends by reading a book the size of a chihuahua, don't read this one. Read ""The Wheel of Time"" instead. Terry Goodkind obviously did"
5,The Kickoff of the adventure of Richard and Kahlan,This is a great story line that continues through 13-14 books. You won't be disappointed.The desparate act of a desparate man and woment to save their world
3,"good story, awful voice","I bought this for my husband b/c he enjoyed listening to the Harry Potter's so much. Jim Dale is an awesome narrator. But, Jim Bond is terrible. It's hard to just focus on the story b/c his narrating is so bland. He puts no emotion into the story and no life into the characters. If not for him this audio cd would get 5 stars."
3,"Entertaining, though mind numbing","I don't read a lot of fantasy (I read primarily SF), but almost everything in this book was familiar. I enjoyed reading it, but I have some complaints. First complaint: This is so similiar to Robert Jordan that one of them ought to be embarrassed (I didn't check copyright dates). The real complaint is out of nowhere, never before mentioned plot twists at the end of a novel. Several things in this book reminded me of Star Trek, where they make up an imaginary problem and an imaginary solution with no previous material to substantiate it or lead you to believe that it might be possible. A storyteller gets to make his own rules, but once you make them you have to follow them. Nothing could be less enjoyable than some of the solutions that were used. I felt cheated by them."
3,Enjoyable Read,"Wizards First Rule was an easy, enjoyable read; the type of novel to peruse in front of a fire on a cold day. Each character played a specific, defined role and, in some aspects, read like a script. The real star of the novel was the plotline. Still, it was a fun read and I would recommend the book."
4,"Excellent character setup , non-stop reading till the end","First off I cannot give a full review for I am not done reading the whole series, but up until this point I am quite inpressed with the reading.I think the characters and story line are wonderful.Sometimes Goodkind wonders a bit far and creates to much.I am currently working on finishing the third novel in the series and I cannot put the books down. If I can say one thing it would be that the books hold my interest with all the different plots going on all over the world new and old. a truly magnificent adventure that I would have never have thought to begin."
2,Not bad but certainly not a masterpiece,"The book is not a bad debut but certainly not the masterpiece I had expected. Some of the players fall into the story from nowhere and out of it and right back in again. Furthermore the writer tried to impress us with the fact that his hero is human by making him cry at the end of almost each chapter and if he is not crying than the female hero is. Like I said, not a back book but the story is not as logical and sound as we would expect from a masterpiece and making the hero human by just making him cry is a shortcoming. Nevertheless I bought the sequel just to see if he is improving because the talent is there."
3,Worth it in the long run,"This was a rough one. When he wrote Book One in this series, Terry Goodkind obviously hadn't figured out how to write yet. It's painful. It really is. I found him describing all the wrong things in detail, and leaving out the important information...for instance, I know what color hair and eyes the characters have, but what do they LOOK like? Very formulaic, rather immature, right-out-of-a-writing-class style.But it gets significantly better as both the book and the series continue. Dialogue becomes more believable. Characters become more interesting. Plot lines *definitely* improve. Although I couldn't shake the feeling that the series was written for someone younger than me (an idea not supported by the sometimes-mature content), I also couldn't put it down. Go figure."
4,Unique themes - Great adult escapism,"You can alwasy tell a unique book when you get very strong and differing opinions. I've read quite a bit of fantasy books starting with my first novel, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" at age 9 and totalling well over 400 books in the genre. I have had to occasionally force myself to finish books or been unable to get through bad ones. I found that I could not put Terry Goodkind's down. I read the first 5 books in 2 weeks (at a heavy cost of sleep and spousal nagging). The unique modern themes including some adult topics and modern political parallels were fun and engaging. While I wouldn't give these to my 10 year old, but I would highly recommend them to an adult that enjoys a good bit of fantasy escapism."
2,"It's not awful, but it's not worth it","I am currently reading this book and would recommend to anyone considering its purchase to look for something more worthwhile. Although it is not an awful book, in that in can be read and you wouldn't throw it in the trash after the first few chapters, I will most certainly not buy any of the sequels. If you are looking for the same old conventional small party quest type fantasy with dialogue that makes you cringe in vicarious shame by all means read it. However, if you desire much better work for true intellectuals who love fantasy try George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series."
2,"Started off good, but what's with this whole S&M thing?","I really liked this book at the start, but then Goodkind's plot ventured into that whole dominance-submission-mistress-slave thing, and I wondered what the hell was going on! I finished this book, but was highly disappointed with what I considered to be a totally inappropriate plot-twist. It was just weird!"
3,"Likable world, very average characters","I was pretty hyped up about reading this book. After reading the Jordan books several times, I think they ruined other fantasy stories for me.The main character, Richard, can pull some answers to problems out of nowhere with maybe a hair of evidence but couldn't figure out who his betrayer was? Obvious from the start of the book. Even with the explanation of what the ""wizard's first rule"" is, people as good at figuring out difficult problems as he should have got this as if it was written in Zed's wizard's sand.I will pick up book two, but I hear it has some big Jordanesque ideas in it.Overall, it kept my attention and it did have closure if you only want to read one of the books. The banter of the characters was not very realistic in more than a few conversations, but it was bareable."
4,fabulous!!,"I loved the book on cd. I dont have alot of time to read but I do have a 22 minute drive to work everyday. The book was great, although it reminded me a little of a couple of other stories. The detail by the author was great and he always left you with a sense of wonder at what was coming next. Great ending and wonderful characters. I can't wait for the next book... I already ordered book 2 on cd."
3,It's Okay,It's an okay fantasy book. It feels like the author has various issues with anger and control and he used fiction to work it out. With a little kink added in.
1,I'd give it a zero if I could.,"This book (and entire series) is a trashy redux of Tolkien that deserves the worst punishment available.All of the characters are flat and dull, the good guys are ENTIRELY good (like angelic,) and all of the bad guys are ENTIRELY bad (like hugely demonic.)There is no real experimentation in any sense throughout this book our the series, believe me, I read it twice. There's the beat up, wheezing idea of the swordsmaster. How original.I suggest something better, like the Dark Tower series by Steven King or China Mieville's Bas-Lag books.Don't read this trash, for the love of god."
4,"Sometimes to gain ground, you need to slow down...","I read this book several years ago. I loved the bittersweet development of Richard and Kahlan. Zedd, at times seemed more as the crazy old uncle than a wise wizard. Though, if you get into this series you should not be the faint of heart. The following books delve into some pretty graphic violent scenes."
2,CLICHE AND CHILDISH,"I have read fantasy since I was seven years old (starting with C.S. Lewis and Tolkien), and this book was on the 2nd grade reading level. The authors writing style was simplistic and redundant, and 90 percent of the images in the book were hackneyed and trite. The Bone Woman and multiflavored Gars were the worst. The only original part of the book concerned the Mord-Sith and the still somewhat cheesy training by pain. If you want a serious good book do not look here."
5,A wonderful surprise!,"I just happened to stumble on this book and didn't really know what to expect. But now that I've read it... wow!This is the most action packed book I've read in ages. I can't believe it hasn't been made into the next Lord of the Rings-- it would make a GREAT movie trilogy!! There's so much going on, and the author does a really great job with his main characters and welcoming you into this new magical world. Interesting people, scary creatures, horrible ""bad guys""-- it was a wonderful surprise to have stumbled across this. I just ordered the entire series! I had no idea its been out for so long. I can't wait to read the rest!!!"
3,the sword of truth series,"is plagerism not illegal anymore? another thing goodkind ""borrowed"" from jordon was writing a few good books and turning them into a ten thousand page cash cow. although i contributed gladly, it pissed me off!"
2,Better than a root canal,"I bought the first three books of this series, due to a recommendation of a friend. Big mistake. Enough people have already described the story already, so I won't bother. The basic idea was good, but the writing is extremely sophomoric to the point of amateurish. The characters are one dimensional and the dialog is childish. The villain's name is Darken Rahl, because Darth Vader was already taken. What little action here was rather predictable, as was the ""surprise"" ending. While I did enjoy the S & M part of the book, I still cannot recommend this to anyone."
2,"boring, slow going, poor writing style","There are a lot of self published books that are far better written than this thing. Very slow going, the hero is presented as some sort of imbecile, the characters aren't engaging. Don't waste your time."
3,Terry Goodkind is almost there...,"This review is designed for someone who hasn't yet read Wizard's First Rule. The book is well written as far as dialogue and grammar. The imagery is a little too graphic, as far as torture and sexual misconduct. The world is too small: The main characters do not spend any amount of time in any one place, nor do they ever accomplish anything significant until the end, which I thought was baloney. However, the basic elements of fantasy are indeed present, with magic, a powerful sword, sexual tension between main characters, wizards, good vs. evil, etc. The book did not leave me feeling better for having read it, however. At least not like Hickman/Weis, Jordan, Brooks, Tolkien, Salvatore, and others did. These are my favorite authors."
1,Goodkind got one thing right.,"Why is this book championed as 'quality' fantasy?Why are there so many five-star reviews on this page?Why are most of those reviews incomprehensible?Why do worthy authors languish in obscurity while a derivitive, stunningly bad hack such as this sells as much as he does?Why do people feel the need to claim this wandering drivel is superior to Tolkien?Easy. Goodkind wrote it himself:PEOPLE ARE STUPID.'Nuff said."
1,Cliche to the utmost extreme,"I'm feeling lazy, and don't like to write a lengthy review, but I've read all the 1 star reviews here and I agree completely with all of them. This book is cliche to the utmost extreme. You can't enjoy it unless you haven't read or seen LOTR. It's so obvious what's going to happen, and there is what, 10 books in this series? Yikes, talk about a complete waste of time. I can already tell you, the hero in this story is going to succeed, he is going to defeat Darken Rahl... so, eh... why keep reading? The story is cliche, Darken Rahl is as good as dead."
4,Engaging story,"Wizards First Rule is an engaging story that hold your interest throughout. The characters are well developed with all the frailties of humans. The heroes stand their ground with truth and honesty, yet humble without arrogance. The ""evil ones"" are vicious, without conscience that leave the reader cheering at their demise. The only complaint is that their is a bit too much repetition in some areas, specifically the chapters regarding the Mord-Syth. It tends to drag out causing the reader to lose interest. Overall I highly recommend this book if you like fantacy, wizards, and magic."
5,Read it. Read it now. If I could recommend any book this would be one of the first ones I would recommend.,"1) Rating: 5 out of 5 stars2) Genre: Fantasy3) Synopsis: After a living, a life without magic Richard is thrown into a magical world where he is given magical responsibilities. Not only does he have new responsibilities but it is up to him to save the world from an evil magician.4) Feelings: I love this book and series. Richard is an awesome character and the romantic tension between Richard and Kahlan is wonderful. This book has everything you could want. Magic, Dragons, Wizards, Witches, and Love.5) Final recommendation: Read it. Read it now. If I could recommend any book this would be one of the first ones I would recommend.Ryan James BurtHusband, Father, and Writer[...]"
5,Finely crafted writing,"The Wizard's First Rule is an excellent book that created a very believable alternate world with a relucant hero who uses strong character traits to win the respect of all with whom he works or battles. He is exceptionally believable in his behavior and holds to his values, making him an exceptional character. The story has some great twists and turns that are totally unexpected. The ending is exceptionally satisfiying, to the point I have gone back a reread it a few times just to relive the satisfaction.This was my first experience with this author, but certainly not my last. He is on my list up there with Orson Scott Card for writing the most believable fantsy with well-crafted characters."
5,Best book I've read in a while...,I loved this book! The action and story line was non-stop...It was hard to ever put the book down. No non-essential details or rambling story lines it was all stuff i wanted to know. Enjoy! I only hope the other 10 in the series are the same.
5,The Wizard's First Rule,"Though this book has been out for a few years now, I have nearly to the end of this book. I am listening to it in audio format. Like the person I just read who reviewed this book I had a hard time getting through the torture scenes and if I could have talked to the author I would have asked if he couldnt cut some of that out. I thought it might have been too much. Other than that I still give this a 5 star review. The audio version is as good as any I have listened to. I have the rest of the series on my list to listen to so I will continue to review the rest as I finish them."
2,If you find pleasure in pain this one's for you,"I was drained at the end of this book and disappointed. The events, creatures, and characters throughout the story are very difficult to imagine in your head, which does not make anyone enjoy the flow. There was too much packed into this story which made me want to skip pages.I loved certain storylines in the book like the whole Rachel saga, and the description of the Confessor getting her ""extra power"" was very strong in my mind. I love the dragon character. But the torture part towards the end of the novel was totally ridiculous and it literally made me sick where I couldn't sleep that night. The most disappointing aspect was that with such a thick book, there was no feeling of a big epic story. The underlying plot of the novel is not out of the ordinary. The end gets very predictable and I had known who the ""villian"" was right at the start of the book.Basically this is a story kids would enjoy but it is told in a grossly masochistic adult way."
5,Great fantasy series,I loved this book from the first page and couldn't put it down and it is long. Some of the later books are not that great but I can't give up on Richard and Kahlan so I keep buying them. I think the first three or four were my favorites so far.
1,Real fantasy lovers BEWARE,"Don't waste your money on Goodkind. A terrible writer who taints the fantasy genre with insipid, juvenile writing and even more insipid characters. How did this person get published? I've read fantasy novels for 20+ years and have never read a fantasy novel that I had trouble finishing, until Goodkind. I returned the books I bought and will never buy another one from this author ever again. I recommend George R.R. Martin or Robin Hobb, or just about anyone else besides Terry Goodkind."
1,does it count if I couldn't finish it?,"Who can read this DRIVEL? Poorly written, with an almost juvenile writing style. Boring. Predictable. The interactions between the Kahlen and Richard, laughable. They have known each other for, um, one day, and already she has ""a secret smile just for him!"" Ugh. I kept reading parts of it out loud to my family and LAUGHING! I had to quit after about 100 pages. I am surprised I managed to get that far and shocked that this is a bestseller. Compares in my mind to the Eragon books by Christopher Paolini, except his are written by a teen, and for a pre-teen and teen audience. Still can't stand them, though. I would skip this book without hesitation."
2,Dookie,"The only reason I give it a 2 is that I am trapped on an oil rig in Mexico and there were no other books on board. I found that if you skip through about 40% of the book you can escape the monotony, repitition and weak plot."
4,short and sweet,"I will make this short and sweet, I really enjoyed the book, yes the characters can be predictable, but the storie was very good, the charactures likable, and I was very much taken with the book. I would recomend it to anyone that enjoys a good fantasy book."
4,Really Worth Reading To The End,"There were places in the story, relating to torture, I had to fast forward because I really didn't want the details. Afterwards, even though I still don't believe the detail was necessary, I recognized and appreciated the reason the author included it. Therefore, don't give up on the book if you come to a part you don't like. I don't think I lost anything by skipping large sections and thoroughly enjoyed the overall story. And Dick Hill was fantastic as usual."
5,A great book..,"This is an once-you-begin-you-cant-stop book..And moreover,at last,an ADULT fantasy book..I have no problem with violence in fiction,but it always seemed to me that most of the fantasy series I was reading were ""masking"" violence under almost victorian narrations.Well this book doesnt.Goodkind doesnt hesitate to rub in your face the remnants of ones hacked body ..And I like it.And moreover,it was one of the few books ever that gave me one night full of nightmares,after reading the chapters with the Mord Sith .The characters are very well developed,and the reader can truly feel they are real.Not caricatures.Though sometimes it gets a bit soapopera-ish (all that stuff about teaching Kahlan about true friendship,companionship etc..)An excellent sample of how first-rate fantasy should be written."
4,Wizard's First Rule,"I am not a huge science fiction/fantasy fan so I was not sure if I would enjoy this book...as it turns out I was pleasantly suprised. The book was very easy to read and the characters realistic. I found myself ""sneaking"" in pages everywhere I could just to find out what would happen next. Can't wait to get my hands on book 2 of the series!"
5,Exquisite!,"What can I say? The book grabbed me and pulled me into the world and minds of the characters. There was never a dull moment!The funny thing is, I didn't even buy the book for myself! I bought it for a friend, but once I got home, I was curious so I read the first paragraph. Then another. Before I knew it, I was out buying the sequel. As for the friend, oh well.I wasn't about to part with my book. Anyway, evey good fantasy reader should go out and get this book. And as for skeptics, you read it too. You'll be another sucessful convert. I promise."
2,Yet another poorly edited e-Book,"An enjoyable book, but the formatting, typesetting and yes even spellchecking that as a customer we're ""paying"" the publishers to value add is awful. Far too many what I assume are OCR errors have got through the latter 3rd of the book, constantly pulling me out of the story to try and work out what was really meant. I'd live with the same issues that I assume exist in the latter books of the series for $2.99 each, but at the asking price between $7 and $9, it's just not worth it. Amazon please attempt to hold publishers accountable for their laziness with eBook releases."
3,"An easy read, though a bit heavy with the cliches","After watching the Legend of the Seeker TV series, I thought I'd try the first book in the Sword of Truth series to see how it compared.Overall, I liked the book better, particularly with regard to character development. However, a number of the scenes in the book dragged a bit, and several situations felt forced and out of place. The book is also reasonably full of cliches--the ending, in particular felt awkward and disappointing.I understand that the author considers himself to be an Objectivist, so I was hoping to see more of that philosophy expressed in the book than in the TV show, which had none as far as I could tell. Unfortunately, although there are a few paragraphs in that direction, the rest of book has a nearly opposite perspective--not just the magic and mysticism, but at a much deeper level. Some might think that's a good thing; for me, it was disappointing."
2,Juvenile Babble,"Annoyingly archetypal characters. Even more annoying lectures on morality filling half the pages. Really, one lecture being repeated over-and-over. I got very good at skipping paragraphs to fast-forward to parts where something was happening. Especially in the later books. If you think the parts where something happened were worth forwarding to, you are mistaken. Could not wait to finish the series so the misery would end. Book 'TiVo' + the fact that I already had the whole series on loan from a friend is the only reason I finished the series. So I guess that deserves two stars. Could be worse."
2,"It's alright, but there are better books on the market....","It took me a long time to get into reading this book. Once I did I found I liked the story line, but Goodkind's writing style is the worst I've seen in years. I've known children who can write better than that. This book is VERY predictable and parts of it have been 'lifted' from other books. Can we say plagarizm?? Richard's time spent with the Mord-Sith was too drawn out and overly brutal...and hints of some BDSM fantasies Goodkind must have. If you have nothing else to read and feel like wading through all 800+ pages then take a crack at it, but there are MUCH better books out there"
5,Wizard's First Rule is a must-read!!!!!!!!!,"In Wizard's First Rule, the hero, Richard, is traveling throughout new land for him. He has a women of great power and beauty, a wizard and friend, and a warden with him on the trip. They are trying to stop their world from total destruction by someone who is close to one of the travelers. Along the way, they meet many different people and creatures.This book has all of the elements of an epic fantasy.It is truly remarkable!! Must Read!!"
3,I'm afraid I'm going to offend a lot of people with this,"Well, this is the first book in the series, and I actually enjoyed it. The style was a little off, and it certainly could have been better, but I still liked it.It introduces a whole new world, with new characters and themes. I liked many of the ideas, and the plot twists kept me reading.Now, the real problem for me was the sequels. I read on, eagerly awaiting further information on Richard, wielder of the sword of truth, and Kahlan, the Mother Confesser and Zedd and so on. I've read the whole series, though I can't figure out why. So no one can say I didn't give it a fair chance.And my conclusion was.... Stop after the first book. They just get worse from there. Granted, that's only my feeling, so don't let me stop you, but I feel it very strongly.The second book was a little worse than the first, and the third a little worse than the second.So, while I liked this book, (liked it, not loved it) my advice is to stop with the one."
2,This book was better the first time when it was called...,"This book mindlessly reuses every fantasy cliche invented. This wouldn't necessarily be bad if it was done well. However, I had to stop reading after a couple hundred pages, it got so mindnumbingly tedious. Go read Tolkien again instead."
3,Wizards First Rule: Don't copy.,"Terry Goodkind's Wizards First Rule is a really good book. However, the deeper you get into The Sword of Truth series you will quickly find yourself (in my oppinion) in a rewritten world of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. As if Terry Goodkind took the Wheel of Time series' outline and just wrote his version of the story. My overall oppinion is just read the Wheel of Time and don't waste your time on these books."
2,Not the worst I've read,"The worst is probably the other books in this series. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is for the interesting creatures and magics that are revealed. In the other books all of that isnt exciting anymore and all we're left with is too perfect characters and horrible dialogue. Also, the level of sex in this book makes it almost a fantasy porn. yuck"
2,Astro Diagnosis a guide to Healing,"This book has no inter-active contents. If that matters to you, then you might want to think about whether or not you want to purchase it. I have the book in hard copy but can no longer read it due to eye problems. I really would like for it to have an inter-active contents. However, I find no fault with the content. It is wonderful. i only gave it two stars because the nature of the contents means a lot to me."
3,"ok, nothing special. Did not fit exact even tho it clearly says for my car.","these things are a dime a dozen. We've had several of them over the years and different cars, and they always seem to do the job for the most part. This one was no better or worse than any other one I've ever had. I was a little disappointed to see that even tho it specifies a factory fit match for my exact model and year vehicle, it actually doesn't fit on one of the wheel wells. I suppose that's what happens when you buy after-market accessories, so I'll just deal with it. Other than that, it seems to be made of decent thickness material, and I expect it will hold up to the usual cargo."
4,"Good product, decent prince","I though the price was a bit high on this product, but considering that it's about the only thing going out there, I guess it was ok. The product works fine. I think it's easier to use than the old ""Wood Preen"". Rather than joining the ""cover it with plastic over and over again"" generation, I'll continue to wax and buff every now and then."
3,Non-Euclidean Geometry,"I am an engineer by education, and it has been many years since my college days. I bought this book to refresh my mind about mathematics and the specifics of non-Euclidean geometry. It is not an easy read, but it does help if one is interested in the subject.Introductory Non-Euclidean Geometry"
3,It'll do,"This is a reasonable purchase.It has dual controls, which is essential for two people sharing a bed.The color is pleasant, but the fabric is a bit lighter in density than I expected. It does not seem to be sturdy enough to hold up for years and years, but it might.I like that it has automatic shut off so if we forget to turn it off, it is not on all day."
1,"If you choose the cheap paperback, it is the lousy printing","This is a great book, but as someone pointed out, this listing also has the Snowball publishing edition. ( The brown cover ).The snowball edition is of poor quality and very difficult to read, but it is only 13.00.I believe if you choose the 1999- paperback, which is 50.00 or so, then you get the Cohen translation.Just be warned.Otherwise it is Newton, what more can you say."
2,Worst Print,"What kind of print is this, you cannot read anything. I didn't like the layout of the book either, I guess I had a wrong impression about what the book is like. Very detailed and weird layout. I think if the print was a good nice one, it would be lot bigger and more expensive. But to make it cheap they made the print - non readable. Would not recommend buying this book."
2,"It might be an important work, but it ain't no fun to read","I read this book prior to taking test my school offered to ""pass-out"" of Calculus I and II. I assumed that this would be the best source since Newton is said to have invented Calculus in this book. I never saw it. I spent three weeks trying to cram this book, and I did not come close to passing the standardized exam. The test didn't resemble this book at all.If you need to learn Calculus or Physics, stick with a recently written book. If you need to learn some archaic way of expressing simple ideas, then this is the book for you.I'm now a second year medical student and I still don't know why I had to learn all that math. Nor do I know why I ever bothered to read this book. It turns out Physics and Calculus are really really simple things, but not if taught by Newton."
5,"Four Ladies, Please","These four singers were never gals but all accomplished, polished performers. They made some wonderful records, among them notable hits, but there were so many wonderful lady singers in the '50s taking the top of the musical mountain alongside Doris Day, Patti Page, Rosemary Clooney, Joni James, Peggy Lee and Teresa Brewer was tough. But there's a lot of great records by other ladies out there--you'll truly enjoy this recording."
5,One of my Favorites Teas!,"I've tried Revolution tea before, but this one came as a surprise. It's very well balanced in terms of green tea and additional flavor. I find so many teas now are overpowering with fruit, berries and other flavors. In some teas, one can't even tell if there is any green tea in it at all.This tea is perfect in flavor, smell and brewing set-up. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Tea!,"My wife and I first experienced this fine tea while on our Honeymoon a few years ago at South Lake Tahoe. We asked the restaurant for the box and proceeded to contact ""Revolution Tea"" for our own personal supply.Ever since we have maintained a sufficient quantity for my wifes enjoyment. Although this tea is not inexpensive, we appreciate the excellent tea selections and the awesome packaging. You get what you pay for!Thank you ""Revolution Tea"" for going the extra mile with your product.Bruce Hayward"
5,Love it!,It was everything I expected! All of Frank's greatest hits on one cd and then some. I love this cd!
5,Dementia CAREGIVERS: complete this workbook.,"Having experienced ""The Great Escape"" in 1996 after my 87-year old father with Alzheimer's disappeared from the nursing home, this book covers everything, including steps to take when your loved one is missing. I urge every enforcement agency to use copies of this book in training; especially, how to approach and talk with a person with dementia. Family caregivers need to complete this workbook and hope they never have to use it. Completing it does provide a wonderful detailed history of our loved ones."
5,"A ""morphological"" journey through the world of Dali","To fully understand the motives behind the works of Salvador Dali, it is imperative to read this book- go directly to the source! I have never come in (indirect, albeit) contact with someone so uniquely intriguing and incredibly amazing. Dali writes about childhood memories, philosophies on wealth, contact with the world and how he views the continually shifting events taking place around him. For anyone who looks over Dali's masterpieces as incomprehensible or obtuse, please take a look at this book- Dali appears to defend his motives, making it easier for viewers to analyze his works. However, once you think you have a foothold in the world of Dali, he pulls the rug right out from under you and denounces the practice of analyzation! A delightful journey-- well worth the time!!"
5,Very Interesting,"I found this story very interesting and more so as my maternal grand father, a lawyer in Delhi, India, was associated with this case."
2,Poorly written and/or translated,The subject of this book is appealing but it is so poorly written and/or translated that I'm having a hard time finishing it. There has to be a better account of this woman's lives. There are defiantly better books about reincarnation.
1,DANGER DO NOT BUY,This product GIVE YOU THE SYMPTOMS YOU ARE TRYING TO CURE. All homeopathic products give you the exact problems in hope it will cure your problem. EXAMPLE: This is how they work! I took Hylands's #7 to stop Skin Eruptions & Colds and it gave me one. DANGEROUS PRODUCTS.
5,Wonderful Charles Perrault,"This is a complete collection of the fairy tales collected by Charles Perrault, the heart and soul of European fairy tales. Beautiful illustrations, easy to read text, highly recommended. These are original versions, without the Disney ""variations."""
4,A KEEPSAKE FOR A YOUNG READER'S LIBRARY,"Who can resist a fairy tale? This beautifully rendered edition includes such timeless classics as ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" ""Cinderella"" and ""Sleeping Beauty.""All eleven of Perault's tales are enchantingly illustrated in ripe watercolors - never has Red Riding Hood's grandmother's cottage looked so venerably aged or forbidding.A handsome volume to be treasured."
3,the complete tales...,"I find this book very well written to be appreciated by all ages. Each story contains a few pictures, and a concluding moral. Anyone who loves fairytales would find this book a pleasure to read..."
4,Charles Perrault and nameless women,"Charles Perrault has written many great fairy tales that we all know and love. Though Perrault's brilliance has made him popular through writing, he reinforces an oppressive, patriarchal ideology. The story of ""Bluebeard"" which is found in his collection, give women no moral. Perrault creates a man that wants complete control over his wives, and then creates a wife that believes in the old customs in doing everything her husband says. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Perrault gives this women who is tied down with marriage and the burden of a housewife no name. She is only referred to as ""she"" and ""her"" throughout the fairy tale.Perrault's stories are great for fairy tale lovers, but if you have any feelings towards giving women their own freedom, then maybe his fairy tales aren't for you."
3,"volume level inconsistent but better then resetting cable box, or HDmi setting","We have the Bose Cinaemate2 system, and our Dynex has only RCA, or Digital coaxial, while the Bose runs optical, or RCA jacks. The RCA connection would drop sound on some stations, meaning you have to reset either the HDMi setting, or shutting down the cable box, then turning back on...at least with this converter..we don't lose sound now..but we still do have a drop off in volume on some stations..so when you have been on one of those stations..watching a show..finding out the volume was louder then one thought, but only after you change channels, can be quiet alarming/wake's your butt up fast."
1,works sometimes,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Wiggle the wires and it may work. Push the cabinet back into place and it may not. Very frustrating. I am buying another of a different brand."
2,2.1 Stereo Audio Only,Please be aware that this device is a 2.1 Stereo sound only. I purchased this product in hopes of full conversion of Dolby Digital sound but I have discovered that it simply cannot do it. This defeats the purpose of digital inputs to begin with. Instead use simple RCA cables if you can. Otherwise look for a converter that will convert at least up to Dolby Digital 5.1
2,Sorry product. Cheap price for a cheap unit,"Unit worked when connected to cable box, but did not work when connected to blu-ray player or a television. This unit does not process all digital coaxial signals to optical."
3,Unique camera,"Not to sound redundant from the other reviews, I'll highlight my pros and cons:Pros:-TRUE 16:9 videos (848x480 pixel MOVs, not the cropped kind. Product description was wrong stating that it can capture only up to 640x480).-Lengthy 20min video captures if you have a 2GB SD card.-16:9 photos-28mm wideangle focal length-LEICA lens-Excellent outdoor photosCons:-Indoor video/photo is grainy-Video captures have less than stellar audio.-Cap Lens coverOverall: Despite is downfalls, its uniqueness compensate for it and sets it apart from many cameras."
2,Sound quality,The samples I hear on this screen are pretty poor. One would hope the CDs are far better.Anyone want to comment on that?
4,Oh....they're gonna Takeover!!!!!!!!,"Oh my goodness! This c.d is off the hook! The production the beats,not to mention the lyrics. So catchy,so orginial! These guys are really talented. I definatly see big things happening for this ""FAMM ENTERTAINMENT"" calabo...I'm glad to see these guys aren't talking about having a Big Benz or a candy red Bently...they're speaking on reality,what's real..Although,they are new on the set,I'm sure it wouldn't take long before we hear something else poppin' from these catz.God bless FAMM!AND THAT'S A STRONGGGGGGGGG 4!!!!"
4,this story was a story until Enron...,"When a limo driver gets sick in the forest and the only person who hears him moaning is his younger brother, can the younger brother still imitate his brother's voice? The answer is YES. A bunch of CEO's frame him of kidnapping an important oil person (who was a crook in himself). This is a book of exciting escapes, poisonous snakes, girls about age of the limo driver's younger brother, blowing hurricanes, and mean old CEO's.Trevor"
2,Low Quality,"I purchased on 9 months ago. First one was DOA (well, it partially worked, but wouldn't switch and the video was terrible.) The replacement worked great... That is until after 9 months, when it completely died (and it only has a 90 day warranty.) The lights light up (sometimes), but all I get out is busts of video ever few seconds.Other people's blurry video is likely the result of connecting both the compisite and S-VIdeo.While I really loved it while it was working, I'd never buy another Sima product again."
4,Technical Guide,Description of the fiberglass repair techniques in a good technical level. The book will guide the do-it-yourself boat owner to successful repairs.
4,Never be Lied to Again,"It is a basic psychology, however, it good to review some of the interacting methods that we might have used."
1,Wow this product really sucks!,"I was very interested in this product when I read the description. However, after receiving the product I was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar. If you have any sense of integrity, ignore this product. The author must me one of the biggest deceivers out there to put such effort in this product."
3,"It only works for the ""Guilty Liar""","The book is allright. It helps if the person who's lying to you feels guilty about it. Or perhaps if they are telling a white lie, and you want to get the truth. But, if the guy doesn't care that he's lying, this book won't help. It's all based on anxiety leaking through body language. Therefore, it also will identify a shy or self conscious person as a liar. Another problem: if the person is lying to himself AND you, it doesn't help either. Because the person REALLY BELIEVES what he is saying is true, even if it's not. This book identified an old girlfriend of mine as being sincere, even though she was lying, because she had fooled herself into believing what she was saying. Not altogether too useful for sorting through mixed / contradictory messages."
1,"may damage relationships & your reputation, often wont work","This book has numerous sample conversations in which ""the seeker of truth"" is advised to mislead, bend the truth, even lie.In the sample conversations, a particular question or statement is supposed to railroad your 'opponent' into 'confessing'.To think that the conversation will normally pan out as suggested is simplistic at best. There are many alternative ways for the other side to react - even if he is lying. So you are unlikely to get the truth.As well, if the other person has not lied, what you are encouraged to say in many of the suggestions ""to get to the truth"" easily and clearly shows you to be a liar and is likely to seriously damage your relationship and reputation."
2,Chock full of overgeneralizations.,This book uses a broad brush to paint many normal mannerisms that people have as clues to prove that they are deceitful. The book is much more helpful at providing clues to show when people are being thruthful. It is unfortunate that the author took the negative side to pump up sales.
2,Hoo hum,"Great title. Unfortunately, in spite of some of the other relatively rave reviews, I did not get that much out of this book. I found it ""okay"" but cannot say I read much that was surprising. If you have never read much in this area, it's a reasonable first start. If you have read a few related books, you probably won't learn much."
3,Spot a liar,"This book provides much information about the signs of a liar. However, impressive as the methods may be, it is not easy to apply them and I am not sure whether all the information the author provide, is accurate. Let's try and see."
2,I'm not sure I'd try this at home,This book contains a few useful gems. Section 6 on Psychological Profile was interesting as well as the discussion on human behavior and Part 8 on tricks people/organizations use to manipulate. The test of the book was crap. I can't imagine treating people the way Lieberman suggests. Maybe I could if I was never going to interact with them again. What lieberman seems to miss is that you can't try to manipulate people day-in and day-out without it harming you reputation with those people.
4,Awesome Techniques,This book was recommended to me by a kind guy at the US Citizen and Immigration Services. Was a little skeptical at first. Very good investment for helping understand human behavior.This book gave me so much insight into what to look for when interviewing and helps me to improve my own skills in communicating with others.I think this is must read for all who want to improve their ability to gather accurate information inorder to make solid managerial or organizational decisions.
1,Honest People Beware,"This book would more aptly be called ""How to Lie to People to Get Them to Tell You the Truth."" The author advocates being dishonest with those you think are lying to you in order to trick them into telling you the truth. And once you have uncovered a lie, the author gives you no advice on what to do next. They've lied, and now you've lied to get them to be honest with you--now what? What people need is not a book that gives them only remotely helpful tips for telling if people are being dishonest (intuition seems to be good enough for most of us) but a book that tells you what to do with the people in your life who are dishonest with you. Catching them in a lie isn't enough--you need to know how to act to prevent the harm that lies can cause--and this book in no way teaches you that. A much better book for someone who is interested in the whole issue of lying is Sisela Bok's ""Lying."""
1,It takes one to know one,"After reading this trash, I realized that it takes a good saleman to peddle and convice people that this method is sound. People believe in what they want and that is why Hitler susceeded. The methods and practices used by Mr. Lieberman does not take into account the many factors necessary to read a person's body language accurately."
1,This book IS the greatest lie,"Ow what a disapointment. I actualy believed this book would work before I ordered it... And what a great lie it ended up being. As the book suggests, it will take you 5 minutes or less to get the truth out of someone... It took me a little longer to get the truth out of this book. The truth is that this book is a great lie. How ironic, eh? Even if you were superman and could remember the few hundred techniques used in this book... you still wouldnt get anywere that common sense would not take you. A really great waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip it fast. In fact, leave this section in less than 5 seconds..."
1,This book is a club with an exploding handle.,"This book appeals to the credulous by encouraging the reader's belief that he or she can reliably detect and expose lies. Unfortunately, this belief is simply false. (See, for example, David Lykken's Tremor in the Blood.) Moreover, in hands naive or reckless enough to put the author's principles into practice, the results are certain to be more harmful than helpful. The book inspires a cynical outlook on one's relations with others and cynical means for exposing them. Following its principles will lead to one's being avoided if not despised by one's associates. It isn't worth it."
4,Fun and useful,"I have mixed emotions about this book. On one hand, it does cover a lot of signs that you are being lied to, and if you know about them you will pay attention and will be more likely to figure out the truth. On the other hand, some methods for finding out the truth are really disturbing because the author advocates using lies and manipulations for discovering the truth. However, I would still recommend reading it. You don't have to use every suggestion in it - use what feels right for you. I especially found the first part of the book useful - this is where the author lists all the signs of lying (and there are a LOT of them, I think that he probably covered them all). The second part lists the aforementioned ""strategies"". All in all, I found the book fun to read and very useful, and it is up to the reader to chose to use the book defensively or offensively."
2,Lie to Discover Lies?,"This book has received five stars from many reviewers; however, it cannot rate five stars in my opinion because the author encourages the reader to engage in lies to catch others lying. In one instance he recounts a story in which the boss is attempting to get a suspected embezzler to tell the truth. To do this the boss promises a great reward (the big office at the end of the hall) if the truth is told and bad circumstances if it isn't. The boss is telling the crook a lie to get the crook to come clean. The crook will be fired if he confesses. The author gives many examples of this type where the reader is encouraged to lie so the offender will tell the truth. But is this a morally correct position? I think not. This book encourages the very activity it condemns. And encourages it in a very big way. Most of the examples fall into the catagory of lying to catch the lier. Bad show overall."
4,"Good book, sometimes impractical.","Generally, this is a good and useful book. Several of the interrogation techniques and body-language clues are immediately applicable, even by complete amateursSome of the author's advice, however, is impractical and/or hypocritical in that in order to determine whether somebody is lying you, the book suggests that you fabricate an elaborate lie yourself, in which to snare your suspect. This renders the techniques unworkable if you anticipate any longer term interraction or relationship with the person you use it on, or their acquaintances, or if your opposition to lying is moral/ethical rather than simply self-interested.All in all, however, the book remains useful, and can be used to create some entertaining parlour games."
1,Different world,"I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation. I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual. As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend. maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience."
4,WARNING: This Review May Cause Fascination,"Upon hearing about this book, and it's title, I asked myself the question, ""This will insure I NEVER get lied to again?"" But upon reading it, I realized what it really meant, was that you could become a better liar than those who are lying to you. If you want to learn how to be a REALLY good liar, buy the book! However, if you want to learn how to lead people towards revealing themselves to you, without betraying your integrity, you will be completely satisfied at how successful Ross Jeffries' Speed Seduction can be for you. Right now, as I see it, that's a much better investment of your money...For me personally, I've had MUCH better success with my life, my relationships, and my finances, using ""Speed Seduction"". So check it out for your own reasons, and decide for yourself just how powerful and rewarding Speed Seduction is in your life. That's my opinion, but you're welcome to it! Be well. Take care. Do all things with DESIRE"
5,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK!,"I think this book is for anyone in a situation where family, friends and co-workers can cloud your judgement. It gives you that ""third eye"" perspective. You are able to go outside your normal feelings and clearly see what is really being said. And you WILL find out who your friends, family or lovers really are... don't wait another day! I am living proof this stuff works and I am far happier knowing, instead of wondering all the time... Good Luck!"
3,Truth 101 or an oversimplification of the obvious,"I believe this author has very little real life experiences...his assertions, if not empirically supported, smack of someone who has lived in academia for the better part of their life. To assert that how people see the world is often a reflection of how they see themselves, doesn't take into consideration many people often view things in a specific way because they have seen similar patterns in people&#65533;s behavior before...therefore, they&#65533;re seeing what's truly going on...not that they maintain, or own, the same traits or behavior!! A good rudimentary pamphlet on lying, but not comprehensive or insightful."
3,Best Seller?,"Could it be our love of truth that made this book a bestseller? We want to know the truth, but we don't want to lie to discover it. It's discouraging to me that lying is such an accepted practice in our culture. I was raised to be truthful, even if it hurt. I have since learned to say, ""I'd rather not say,"" if I do not want to tell everything I know.One part in particular would have been useful to me 5 years ago when the book first came out; namely, the section on ""Special Occasions"" referring to dealing with one's manager. For example, if it's a bright sunny day and your boss is trying to pressure you to sign an affidavid that swears it's pouring down rain, windy, with thunder, what should you say? The author recommends something like, ""You're smart and very successful; tell me what you would do if you were in my position now."" I don't know if it would have worked, but I would sure have tried it."
1,HT discriminate against honest people with disabilities,"All the symptoms David mentions can also explain medical conditions BEYOND THE PERSON'S CONTROL (about 15% of the population):1. anxiety2. distractibility/concentration problems:Some people concentrate BETTER when they are not looking the person in the eye or looking elsewhere!My recommendation to David, check out any book on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults. Or visit a libriary more often.-Miffed in Maryland"
2,"Good for lying, not for those who are lied to.","This book provides for some very obvious ways we can uncover deceit in others (i.e. lack of eye contact) and many more subtle ways which require years of practice to observe in other people. However, the clues provided here can be used to immediate effect in ones own repertoire of lying behavior. There is a disclaimer in the front of the book but, unfortunately, this book will benefit exactly those persons we are trying to uncover."
3,Hard to Reconcile the Pusposed Techniques Against Values,"I agree with the reader from Palo Alto. While this book is interesting and it provides some valid insights, its suggested techniques for getting to the truth employ lying. Not only that, but it coaches you to be a convincing liar. For me, this presents the morale dilema. Is it okay to lie when you think someone else is? What do you do if you use some of the techniques in this book that encourage you to accuse someone outright, and you are wrong? The book never addresses how to reconcile this and it leaves the reader to decide if it is okay to become what they are trying to avoid."
4,Not bad at all,"This is a pretty good book and an easy read. As a seventh grade teacher, I'm hoping to incorporate some of the tactics to help keep my little darlings honest."
3,Good but It Doesn't Give You SuperPowers,"The author does an excellent job of teaching you how to tell if someone is lying. Basically, liars work to defend themselves. The innocent, on the other hand, have no reason to even begin a defense. Furthermore, the book discusses ways you can find out the truth. These strategies are used in such a way that an indirect confession is nearly guaranteed. Full confessions are also a typical result of these tactics. The examples used are from romantic & working relationships, but many of the lessons can be applied throughout your daily interactions. It doesn't give you a sixth sense like I hoped. Unless you do more study, it can still be difficult to tell with exact precision whether or not someone is lying. You'll second guess yourself but read it and review it from time to time and you'll get better."
2,Hope a revised version is in the works...,"Given the complexity of the subject matter, this book was about 60 pages too long and another 250 too short.I'm kind of a, well let's just say it, expert on lying and interpersonal communication. Heck, just look at what I've been able to get across in just 2 sentences plus this one.In conclusion I think this book took a subject matter which is deserving of much more serious consideration - at least 200 more pages of such - and presented it in a fairly random and scattered fashion with ""real-life examples"" consisting of dialog that a That 70's Show fan would scoff at. Taking the other route, the author could have cut out at least 60 pages of fluff and Summaries which appear at the end of some sections and not others, and written a darn good pocket guide to deception-detecting.My 2-star rating means that I liked about 40% of what I read so I will check out this author's other books if I come across them."
2,This book seems to be limited in scope.,This book seems to be limited in scope. It doesn't seek to explain other possible explanations for the behaviors mentioned. This book could possibly lead someone to believe they were being lied to when they are actually being told the truth. U also believe there is a good possibility you will upset anyone you try to use the methods on.
1,Confusing Nervous with Dishonest,"This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book, taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and ""hypnotizing"" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself."
2,Lie and deceive your way to the truth!,"This book does what it claims to do: it helps you find out whether you're being lied to, and it teaches you how to find the truth. However, the book's major weakness is that the author recommends finding the truth by lying to others and manipulating them. For example, many of his techniques require the use of misleading questions. And manipulative? He teaches you how to HYPNOTIZE people so they'll do what you want! This irony ruins an otherwise effective presentation. This book cannot help you fight lying unless you yourself are a liar . . . in which case you have no reason to complain when people lie to you. Become more honest and you'll be amazed at how you seem to deal with fewer liars, for honest people gravitate to other honest people, and liars gravitate to liars."
5,Bonsai Wire for Bonsai or Other Plants,need some wire for plants that need good drainage? Try this brand and this vendor. GREAT job on this -- and it's ideal to what was needed. So glad I chose the correct wire.Fast shipping too.
3,Cute and Partially Durable,My dog is a 8 month old shepherd/retreiver mix. He had the elastic tail chewed off in seconds and I had to fish it out of his mouth. Since then he is only allowed to have it for brief periods under my watchful eye. He really loves it though and is very excited to see it come out of the toy box.
5,Adorable!,"My 5 year old daugther just loves it! She loves the pictures, and the idea that she is ""just like mommy"". I love it because I can show her that we have lots in common. We read the book every night before she goes to bed. I even got a 2nd copy for my 2nd daugther's book collection (she'll be born in August)."
5,A Wonderful FInd,"I came across this while searching for material on Carolyn Leigh after purchasing a CD by Julie Wilson singing the songs of Cy Coleman (Leigh's most notable collaborator). I had never heard of Sarah Zahn, but I took a chance, and I'm so glad I did. She's a fine singer and her love for this music comes across in every note. I confess, I didnt know much about Leigh before the Wilson CD, only that she'd written some Broadway shows. You will recognize some of the Coleman songs here, but there is so much more to Leigh than that. There are so many gems on here, it would take too long to list them. Suffice it to say, there isnt a dud on here. My only complaint is Zahn didnt sing Witchcraft and Come Summer (my favorite Leigh song) as solo pieces. I cant praise this CD enough. Its one of my all time favs. I wish Leigh were better known, she never received the success she deserved. I'd give this ten stars if I could....Fantastic."
5,"Sweet, innocent and fun!","My son loves busytown and this video. There are three good stories on this tape - all nonviolent, demonstrating good values, and telling interesting stories. There is a short saftey video ""Stop, Look and Listen!"" - about crossing the street (the tune is catchy). The characters are sweet. The families and neighbors are nice, good people. If only all busytowns were really like this!"
2,Disappointed Anime Fan,"Not the kind of anime I was expecting. It is from the creator of Astro Boy, so all the characters have the Astor Boyish look. Confusing, I fell asleep in the middle of the movie."
4,"Worth Watching, but not typical","The artwork is brillant and awe-inspiring, the music is whimsical and vibrant, and the question posed by the film is one that humanity genuinely faces.Overall the movie is a marvelous experience, but you need to detach yourself from certain expectations. For example, the design of the characters does not match the gravity of their setting, likewise you might find the music a bit anachronistic."
4,Interesting Anime...,"I originally rented this movie as an ""I just want to see an Anime movie"" rental. I must say that I was quite surprised at how this movie turned out to be. The backgrounds used in this movie are spectacular (to me, they looked almost like the CG movies found in the Final Fantasy VIII and IX games). The plot was very interesting as well; it made you wonder what was going to happen next. All in all, the merging of animation and computer-rendered backgrounds in this movie look great (they don't look ""cheesy"" at all). I really don't excessively buy DVDs, but I may just get this one. Also, if you like this movie, or are a fan of Anime, I suggest renting/buying Princess Mononoke (a very good movie as well)."
4,"Old Story, New Way to Tell It.","I read a lot of reviews of this movie and it's true, the story's tried and true. But, as a longtime anime fan, I didn't care about that. The way that Otomo and Rintaro told it (especially with the music and visuals) kept me interested the whole way through. The DVD is a great investment, because not only do you see the film, you see (in the pocket DVD that goes with it) just how DIFFICULT it was to put digital graphics, and pen and ink together. You get a greater appreciation for the film when you see how it's made. I know I did. So, it's a story that's been told before, but this is a new way to share it. I personally think it's worth the price alone."
1,It doesn't get any better....,"From the moment this movie starts, the viewer can expect to be in for a whollop of bad entertainment. The colors are stodgy and the characters look like they are on growth hormones with their beady eyes and hyper-long arms. But that is not even the worst part of it...Honest to God, between stiff acting, a grating soundtrack, and a lack of plot, this picture should be credited to Al Gore instead of Tezuka. The team have done him a great disservice. Ultimately, this picture is about as exciting as a flat roller coaster."
1,I can't tell which is worse: The animation or the story?,"I am going to make this review short. Three major reasons why I didn't like Metropolis:The Animation -- What is up with the fat heads, mustaches or other body features? Placed on a computer generated background, it either looks like an very very old Japanimation, or a really bad attempt to immitate American cartoons. I can't seem to tell which.The Story -- Lack of character developement, and with few action sequences in between a boring plot.The Music -- Where did they get the music they used for this movie? Are you sure I'm not watching an old American cartoon? I know that this anime was a remake of an old anime, but don't you think they could've at least updated the music a little? Awful!If this is the evolution of Anime, then I had better finish off my Dragonball Z collection while I still can and look for a new hobby."
2,good lord!!!!!!!,"basically this is a remake of Fritz Lang's silent film ""Metropolis"" form 1927. and it is afully done!!! if you want to see a true masterpeice seen the original, live action, silent, ""Metropolis"". trust me, it is much better. any movie done by Fritz Lang is better!! Blockbuster shoud destroy all memberships for those who rent this movie! the animation is good, yes, but other than that it is a horrible remake of a classic film masterpeice!"
1,Very very bad,"This is a perfect example of the worst in Japanese animation. I love good anime but this is not good anime.First of all the whole ad campaign was of this amazing ""future metropolis"" but what's amazing about it? It's not as amazing as the metropolis in several movies that came before it. For example The Fifth Element or Judge Dredd.Okay fine you say about how about as a movie? Well, it [stinks]. As almost all *bad* Japanese anime goes, it a series of images and issues the director thought would be *cool* without one thought about how they work together. The story is over moralizing, preachy and on top of that it's old stuff. This basic story has been seen tons of times before. The mix of styles does not work. The soundtrack, while maybe quality music, is horrid for the movie and hurts it tremendously. I would have walked out if I had not been treated to see it...."
1,"The Art, The Story...Horrible.","When I first saw the character design (which is much like fifties American cartoons) I thought, ""Uh...is this going to change in the second disc?"".I was just fooling myself of course.The backround art, is exceptional however. It really annoyed me. I would love to see the characters with that art quality.Some say the way the characters look is 'refreshing.'. I don't see it.As for the story, it's way overdone and has nothing special about it.The best thing about this movie was some of the music and the backround art.I would explain the story, but there are so many other reviewers doing so, and frankly, it's so forgettable, I can't tell you much.If you like the sound of the other reviews though, you should rent it. I think you'll either love or hate this anime.If you're looking for an anime that's good for children, I suggest to you Panda! Go Panda! or Kiki's Delivery Service.I think, though, you're probably here because of all the hype surronding this movie."
2,Tima's last scene,"It'd been a long time since I hadn't seen a 'one scene' capable of rescuing a whole anime movie. (I wished for a scene like this one all along Akira for instance, and ... nope, it never happened, not one scene saved it, it sucked until the very end.) Other anime don't need such scenes because they are entertaining or decidedly good; not quite the case with Metropolis.The design of the characters is quite dull, which contrasts distastefully with the (for the most part) great scenery of the picture. I'd say though that the major achievement of the designers was to portray the robot girl so beautifully, which was essential for the movie itself.On the whole, the plot seems week, as does the script; but we'll always have that last scene between Kenichi and Tima ... which would have been the only reason for a third star, but it does not pay off for a rather mild film."
1,The worst anime I've seen,"I truly do not understand how so many reviewers liked this film. The animation while technically brilliant, is simply asthetically distasteful because the author decided on a character style that went out in the 30's.The characters are laughably shallow and the plot was tired back in the 80's when it was popular.But I guess if you're the creator of Akira, you can polish up a turd and the masses will call it art."
1,Snooze Plot,Alright I was hopeful that this anime would turn out to be a superb materpiece! However i started the movie and fell asleeps fourty-five minutes into the picture.People raved how great the graphics were nbut i feel that CGI has no place in anime.This movie should recieve negative stars.
2,"Beautiful Imagery, Poor Story","Beautiful animation, this film is in a catagory all its own. The scenery and characters look great. There are some throw backs to Akira and Metropolis, but it is an amazing visual experience to watch this film. ...notice I said an amazing VISUAL experience. The plot is laughable at best. There are so many holes in the story you really have to ignore it and just enjoy the great animation."
4,Metro-too-polis,"This is a very intersting piece. Not the best art but it is anime! The music doesn't match the ""theme"" in some scenes so I gave a 4. So...Cool story, inapropriate music for the emotions."
4,Jonbenet and Saturation Bombing,"A strange mix of ""high"" and ""cutesy"" take this animated feature into uncharted territories. Childhood innocence hits a wall of cynicism and war in this breathtakingly beautiful, animated feature from Japan. This is not for everyone, but if you like Final Fantasy, Blade Runner or the Wizard of Oz, you may very well love this. I did."
5,Metropolis,"I think it was fantastic! I've enjoyed watching it immensely. I noticed he used characters from porevious movies of tezuka, like ham-egg, who was in ""emperor leo"" and Dr. Walrus. The back-ground (buildings, streets, etc.) were really detailed."
4,Balance and Contrast,"There seems to be an equal number of people who like this film to those who dont. Allow me to throw in my two cents... A lot of those who didnt like it expressed their distaste for the animation style and how it doesnt fit in with the digital backdrop. I actually liked the animation and found that the two styles complimented each other nicely. Similarly, I thought that the music also complimented the film well. The Ray Charles track at the films end was not odd to me at all, and in fact, was a very nice and very different approach--a total contrast to the nature of the scene. I do not know why people have problems with the plot though, as it didnt bother me at all. I felt the film provided a good message of identity and to a lesser extent, social classes."
3,It is kinda pretty,"This was a nice movie...but it didn't have much of a endingHowever, it is worth watching once... :)"
3,Not worth the hype,"Not all hype is good. I felt tricked by the good reviews for this movie. Sure it had huge production values, but so did ""Water World"". Maybe if you live in a world of only anime then the retro looking characters triggered some nostalgia, but not me. My most common issue with similarly over hyped anime is that the plot and characters aren't up to par. The slow pace isn't an issue, and used well it can be great. But this movie has cringe worthy moments. Might be best just to read the subtitles and imagine it's better than it is. It had it's moments and is worth a rental, so I won't give it 2 stars (but I'm very tempted to do so)."
4,"Quite different, quite good!","I just saw this. I'd almost say ""absolutely amazing"", but it's not quite. It's not 100%, but I'd give it A+ for sure.I like the background music, very unique and different and gives it a good feel. This is definitely NOT a children's movie.I'm not going to say much about the plot, so as not to spoil it so much.Very nice story line and although it seemed kind of short, plenty of time to get attached to the characters. Well, maybe a bit longer would've been better.I dunno if I'd buy it for $25 (I'm cheap. Very few movies are worth $25 to me), but this is a ""must see"" at some point. For sure worth renting it out at the video store."
5,"Intense, Emotional, Thrilling, Funny!","I have been dying to see this movie for so long (before I saw it I didn't know what I was going to see, I just like watching anime and that is what this is). I finally rented it and absolutely loved it. I found it to have the psychotic-ness of both ""Akira"" (the director and creator Katsuhiro Otomo, wrote the screenplay for ""Metropolis"") and the dark and emotional sense of ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"". Actually there was an uncanny resemblence of both movies in this one. The anarchist elements of ""Akira"" are featured throughout the movie and one of the main characters is a robot hater that is reminiscent of some of the characters in ""A.I.""! I enjoyed this movie thoroughly and will add this movie to my collection. Watch it if you have seen Akira and A.I. and try to find the scenes I'm talking about."
3,So-So Story...Fantastic Animation,"The story of Metropolis was a bit convoluted and needlessly complicated, it actually detracted a bit from the awesome animation. Another distraction was, and I hesitate to say, the subtitles. Usually, subtitles are better than voice-overs, but in the case of this movie, where your attention needs to be drawn to the animation, it was distracting to read the subtitles and try to look at what was happening. Often times, many key visual elements were missed because I had to read the story. At times the pacing was a bit slow, but the jazzy, up tempo music kept things moving. The story was merely mediocre, but the fantastic fusion of cgi and traditionaly anime animation more than made up for its shortcomings."
2,Boring,"I love animated films and I was looking forward to it when it was released, after some searching over here I got it, sat down and was never more bored.First off, the cityscapes are superb, but the ""Popeye"" type characters looked very out of place against the scenery. Not only were they very Pokemon colored they had very limited facial expressions and I could not get the feeling that the translation crew had left out loads !The ending would probably have been very moving if I had developed any feeling for any of the characters in the film. The personal character development is non existent and basically the film dragged out for me, and as I said , while the end of the film was pretty good I pretty much felt no sentiments for the characters, robotic or otherwise. Its a shame really as this had potential to be an excellent flick."
2,it's got nothing on fritz lang,"being a fan of the original metropolis, i decided to check this one out. i found it pretty disappointing, the reviewer who noted the incongruity of ""i can't stop loving you"" accompanying the finale describes only one moment out of this film of bad ideas. no new interpretations of what it is to be human, to be a member of society... simply the old standby: boy meets cute robot, then everything goes promptly to hell. do yourself a favor and check out the original silent metropolis. the reason this movie borrows so heavily is because it was ahead of its time."
3,disappointed,it was super friendly introduced to me by the dealer.. and was told that metropolis is the top selling anime in USA at this time round..... a bit disappointing i was.. after watching it.. that wasnt that much interesting and attactive sights i thuoght.. 2 of my japanese friends fell asleep while watching it.. metropolis hav quite an interesting idea abt robots and stuff like that.... juz the story wasnt that nice...
2,Visually exciting in spots; plot is non-existent,There are some great visual set pieces here and there in this film but what is this supposed to be about?? Not for adults.
2,Eh...,"A little over the top for me. Tries too hard to be inspirational and uses too many stories that don't really tie together. The whole book seems a little mis-matched for itself, in my opinion."
5,Fantastic!!,Great book. I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in getting more out of life!!
1,TERRIBLE BOOK.. MORE PADDING THAN A WONDERBRA,"No Opportunity Wasted!I think about the opportunities I wasted.. the opportunity to spend the time more constructively than I did when I was reading this book.I feel like I was ripped off by this book.. it's nothing but a money spinning journey of self indulgence for the author.. to think I gave this guy any of my cash.I put the book down before I finished.. I figured if I heard the phrase ""We'll get to that later"" again I would go mad. He spends most of the first few chapters saying that and and by the time you get halfway through the book all you've learnt is how great the author thinks he is.Forget about wasted opportunities.. you should be more concerned about wasted cash."
2,I have to agree with Sally Ann SA,"This is a great book for thrillseekers and risk takers. As a typical American women living a quality life, I felt that there was little in this for me. I would suggest the Power of Focus by Jack Canfield as a better alternative to focus and live your dreams."
2,Engaging what?,"I have yet to finish this book; however, for the portions I have already read, I am not impressed. To begin, his expanded usage of the English language is unnecessary for the simplicity of his context. He also frequently uses run on sentences that can be as long as 64 words! Also, ""his"" concepts are more or less variances others theory's. Not that he doesn't give credit where it is due, but where are his original thoughts? The first half of the book is lofty, very wordy and lacking clear definitions. Perhaps this may be a test to see if I can Engage in learning.As an FYI, I had to read this as it was an assigned reading for one of my Web Development college courses."
1,Don't waste the money!,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this candle. It is made of a very thin wax and the wick is fragile, hence the candle did not burn well. I had to throw it away after 6 hours of use as it was no longer usable! I enjoy a candle that is not overpowering yet subtly freshens my home with a delightful fragrance. The fragrance from this candle was non existent. I would NOT recommend these candles!"
4,modern regression with minitab macros,"Usually books on regression analysis deal with only linear regression. This text includes thorough coverage of the standard regression topics but also includes chapters on logistic regression, nonparametric regression, robust regression, ridge regression and nonlinear regression. Recent tools including the bootstrap are covered. Software for ridge regression is discussed and a Minitab macro is given in Appendix A. Software is also provided in the attached diskette with installation instructions in Appendix A.Ryan is an excellent writer who does not assume a high level of mathematical sophistication. He has also written an earlier text on statistical quality control ""Statistical Methods for Quality Improvement"" which came out in a second edition earlier this year."
2,Too much for too little,"I love Gucci Rush,but I was really shocked how high the price was for a sample.I found an ounce on ebay for 45.00.And the shipping was free.They were very quick to refund my money though."
3,Rex Stout Light,"The plot was enjoyable, with a conclusion that was not too obvious yet still fit. However, Robert Goldsborough's writing feels like ""Rex Stout Light."" His depictions of Archie and Wolfe, while fairly accurate, are one-note and shallow. For instance, this book harped on Wolfe's stubborn reluctance to work on a case, unless finanacially forced to do so. Although true of Nero Wolfe, there are so many more aspects and a depth to the character that Goldsborough excluded."
1,Death on Deadline,disappointed. a slap in the face to rex stout and nero wolfe fans. goldsborough chose to burden nero wolfe and the reader with his liberal political viewpoints in a number of places throughout this book. i believe rex stout would be disappointed and upset with goldsborough using to push his own political bias. Ty
4,Rarities for WWII military,"Spike and the Slickers recorded these during 1943 (when nothing was recorded for RCA Victor) and 1944. Most performances are less ""polished,"" as they were not intended for the general public and their studio time was donated. Several familiar titles are actually EARLIER versions. And some of the material (""As Time Goes By"")was never recorded anywhere else. But there are some down sides to the CD: Several tracks are NOT from V-disc (""Cocktails for Two,"" and ""Chloe"" are dubs from RCA Victor records). One of the V-Discs sides, ""You Can't Say No To A Soldier,"" does not appear. (No big loss -- this was a sappy ""straight"" patriotic song, and is available on another CD anyway.) Most odd is the appearance of ""Holiday for Strings"" -- which was never a V-Disc release (although it was considered at one time; perhaps the source archive for the CD mastering was ""test pressings?"") Sound quality ranges from pretty good to very scratchy. But they are an entertaining bit of history."
5,These are the songs!,Really like the fact that when my life has become very complicated I can listen to the songs of my youth and reframe life as simple and straightforward. Reminds me of what is really important.
5,Great start for learning some ceremonial songs,"My husband was leading a ceremonial circle for native inmates at a local state prison. He knows many songs but his hearing is bad so he asked for my help in putting together some song that the inmates could learn between ceremonial meetings. This collection, is similar to some of the songs we use in our ceremonies, but much slower and very easy to hear. The men are from several nations and do not all speak Lakota. I transcribed the words for the men and they have learned all the songs and are now able to learn others songs more easily since they have developed an ear for the Lakota language."
5,Madden Has Been Dethroned!!!!,"First of all, congratulate EA Sports for laying claim to the #1 console football game for so many years. Thankfully, however, their reign has ended. This ESPN NFL 2K4 by Sega is a superior gaming experience. You may not be able to set the price of a hot dog with 2K4, but you will be able to experience the most realistic gameplay ever offered in a football title. From the tutorial practice mode through the Franchise sim and onto the playing field, this game just feels more real than Madden. The graphics are outstanding and the playcalling is user-friendly. Highly, highly recommended. (BTW - I'd give Madden 2004 3.5 stars)."
4,espn football,"Espn Football is probably the best and the greatiest football game for Plastation2,But thats just my opinion ! But you can rate it what ever you want. Oh and some of you poeple might think im CRAZY by rating this game a five! from cass mckay to all readers of this note!"
2,Still Just the First Loser,"ESPN and Sega changed the name of the game, they changed the interface, they changed the coverboy. They, however, did not change the gameplay. This game lacks movements, realism, and the depth that Madden 2004 has. I just don't think that as many improvements were made from NFL 2K3 as should have been made. The game was ($$$) after a month of availablty. I wouldn't be surprised to see the same thing here. Sorry ESPN, maybe you should have teamed up with EA, a proven winner."
2,Worst Football Game,I hate this game. I cant stand it. If you want a football game get madden! This game is hard and not fun and the graphics arent so great. so dont get it now.
5,Best Football Game Ever!,"The First Time I played this I was at my cousin's house. It was so fun. Then on June 2, 2004 I was in a Blockbuster store and they had games to buy. This was one of them. I bought it and I played it. It was still fun."
3,Espn vs. madden,this game has no comparison to madden in so many ways if you've plaed then both you will understand what i am talking about.
2,Madden clearly superior,"i have been a diehard madden fan since as long as i can remember. i then heard about espn nfl football. i decided to go rent it after hearing some excellent reviews. one word. terrible. the only things that were better about it than madden were the more realistic tackles and the excellent comentating. other than that it sucked. when running, you run on a fixed line. for example you can only run at a certain amount of degrees while in madden the running lines are infinite. o ya and another thing the charge up moves are gay. that is so stupid. in real football you arent running and all of a sudden you think, ok time to charge up for a power juke!!! so anywho, madden is clearly better."
5,Excellent compilation!,"This book far exceeds both The Renderman Companiona and Texturing and Modeling: A procedural approach(Two very good books) in the presentation of massive amounts of information, as well as simplicity of presentation. While this book does sort of deal more with BMRT and PRMan(look at the authors, sheesh...) than the Interface, per se, it does a very nice job of presenting information specifically geared towards them. The inclusion of a section on mathmatics and physics is especially appealing for me, because I'm not yet out of high school. Anyway, if you aren't too much of a miser, buy this book.Oh, and since these reviews are not supposed to reveal cruical plot elements: There IS a self shading cloud shader!"
2,Not ready for prime time,"I'll echo what the lady said about the fact that this stupid thing is top-heavy and dangerous when the kiddos start crawling around, but it does the job--that is until the fan stops working a few months in--after the crappy 90-day warranty's run out, of course. It eats D batteries too (it takes four), but you'd better hope the fan doesn't bite it like it did on ours. The manufacturer won't replace it after 90 days and if the fan doesn't work, the whole thing stinks to high heaven.Haven't used any other diaper disposal units, but this one sucks!"
2,way too noisy,"You may be better off just buying a regular trash can that seals tightly. This ""diaper disposal system"" does an OK job of odor control, but opening and closing it makes a rather jarring noise every single time. It almost sounds as if the whole thing is breaking, really. Not a pleasant experience when trying to keep a baby calm."
1,As bad as the crap it's supposed to shield us from,"We got rid of this after desperately trying to like it for 6 months. The first 3 months, the diapers wouldn't fall down the chute because they were 'too light.' So we waited until the diapers got heavier. Then, even after diapers got heavy, we'd still find diapers that hadn't been pushed down by the hi-tech piece of plastic that was supposed to do the job.The filters are expensive, as are the 4 D batteries needed to run the filter. The filter never really filtered anything. I know, because I've replaced this with a hand cranked diaper champ, which still smells somewhat, but no worse than this product.I was so happy to finally bring this out to the dumpster. Total junk disguised as new technology."
1,the worst product ever,This product does not work. mechanism to take the diaper from top into the waste basket is terrible and does not work. A complete waste of money.
4,Cost effective,"THis diaper pail is great at containing odors and I love that I can use regular cheap garbage bags with it!! This is the third one i'm buying- 2 in kids rooms upstairs and one for downstairs.However, it's not the most user-friendly diaper pail out there. babysitter sometimes uses it incorrectly and diaper gets stuck. But, easy to fix."
4,"Great product, getting another one for our second child",We have been using this for two years now & decided to buy a second one for our new baby's room too. We've been very happy with it overall. The filter system works great & batteries last a long time in the unit.
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this in hopes of curing the problems I had with the diaper genie. With the diaper genie I hated the twisting of the bag and shoving of the diaper. This eliminated that by just dropping it into the the bag. However, the crimping system they talk about is very loud. It is worse than the noise created from the twisting of the diaper genie. It would be very startling to a infant. The other plus I thought it had was the filtration system. But I am taking it back because it is just way to loud for my liking. Also, you have to have 4 D Batteries to operate the fan. I am going to purchase the Graco Diaper Pail that has just been released. It has a lot of the same features. You can use regular garbage bags, and it also has a filter. It has a sensor for hands free diaper dispensing. Hopefully it is not as loud as the First Years one."
1,Don't BUY!,"This was the worst diaper pail, so far. It does not lock-in oder. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Did not last,"We purchased this diaper pail from Amazon. At first we loved it even though the lid was a bit top heavy. We just put it against the wall to compensate. The bad thing about this diaper pail is that the weight of the bag, once filled with diapers, caused the bag clamp to break. So now it does not prevent odors from escaping the pail. It is poorly designed and we are now searching for a replacement."
1,Stops working every two days!!,"I have had to replace the batteries several times on this unit and I've only had it for a few months. Last week I just replaced them again with brand new Energizer Max batteries ([...]), and they lasted two days. Yes, I said two days!! Who can afford [...] bucks every two days to maintain a [...] dollar unit? I think I'll have to live with a little stink, 'cause the cost stinks alot worse. Thanks for flushing my money down the toilet, The First Years!"
1,bad product,It has absolutely horrible design. It's complicated to install and to use. You are wasting money on replacement of batteries. All together it's an expensive and bad product.
1,HORRIBLE Product Design,"I just assembled this product. The plastic hinges nearly broke off during installation, it is very cheaply made. But that's not the worst part... the product is designed to make a really loud noise every time you close the lid. It is incredibly loud, sure to make your baby cry every time you close it. I laughed out loud when I realized that it was actually not defective but designed that way. It's almost as if the product designers put this thing together on April Fool's day as a practical joke."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have had this diaper pail for only 3 months and the lid actually broke. I want to also say that I was always very gentle with the lid, since everytime I opened or shut it, it sounded like it was going to break. It will not close shut now, which creates a problem because unless the lid is closed, the fan and filter do not work."
1,It stinks..... literally,"The diaper pail we had for my first daughter required special liners. They no longer make them, so we had to switch pails. This one is terrible. It smells so bad. I got really spoiled with the last one. And when you press the button I have to bend way over to see if it worked. THen I open it, and the diaper never goes down on its own. What's the point?? It's not noisy, it just doesn't work."
1,Great idea... BAD design!,"When we first got this product, we were ecstatic! It was easy to use and there was absolutely NO odor. Then, after only a couple of days of use, the batteries needed replacing (4 Size D batteries). We figured it was just a fluke, so we replaced them. After about 2 weeks, they were used up again. We tried replacing them one more time, but found the same problem occurred within 2 weeks or so. We decided the cost of buying batteries was far less than getting a different pail!"
1,the worst diaper pail ever,"this diaper pail is the most frustrating ever! Let's face it, i don't think odorless is possible but this is far from ""clean air"". I have to keep changing the battery and the diaper never goes down from the top compartment.I have been through 3 diapers hoping this would be the charm but is just dissappointing. A regular trash bin is much more effective for me - that's how bad it is. Please do not buy this product!"
2,Not sure what my $50 got me.,"While my husband doesn't think it controls the odor at all, I think it does...a little.Instead my complaints are in its design. It's small. The lid is a pain to operate. You definitely need two hands to operate, so don't bother picking up the baby until you are done disposing of the diaper. My babysitter constantly shuts it off because she thinks it's the button to open the lid.So, in short, it probably does keep the air a little less stinky, but the ergonomics of the product are poorer than poor."
1,Clean Air Diaper - WASTE OF MONEY,"My wife and I purchased one of Learning Curve diaper containers about 6 months ago. We have noticed this product doesn't work anymore. We purchased another set of batteries to see if that was the issue and it wasn't. Due to the lack of work on this unit, I had to remove this item from my daughters room. We have given up on this product due to it's defects and I will not purchase another product from Learning Curve again. We were very disappointed with the product. I will let other sites know if this issue until I succeed in having this product removed from the shelf. I feel it not right to have others experience what we did. There's to many products on the market for people to deal with this product. I apologize for the distasteful email, but I figure other should know."
4,Great Diaper Pail,"This is the 2nd Clean Air Diaper Disposal System that I've purchased. I purchased my first with the birth of my first son and loved it so much that I bought it again when we added our second. I always hate it when you walk into a baby's room and all you smell is diaper pail, but I have never had that issue with this one. It leaves my son's room smelling great, and I love that you can use regular garbage sacks with it. It's even easy enough to use that my 2 year old son can put his own diapers in!The only thing I don't love about it is that it is kind of loud when you open and close the lid. Other than that I love it!"
4,No problems here,"I like this diaper pail. I love that it uses regular trash bags; that is so convenient. It will keep almost a week's worth of dirty diapers from smelling up my baby's small room. There's no odor at all until you open the lid - ew! It definitely smells down in the pail when I change bag, but there's not a trace of bad smell in her room. The only thing I don't love about it is that the lid is really heavy and cumbersome when changing the bag and can make the pail fall over. It's not a huge problem though.Update 1/2011: We are still using this diaper pail after having it for 2 years. We still like it. We happened to have lost both of the interior parts -- the circular part that holds in the back, and that pyramid that pushes the diaper into the pail -- and I called the company to try to purchase replacements. They sent them to us immediately at no charge! I was shocked and very thankful!"
3,Not that bad,"I've read all the reviews and agree with some of them. I've had the pail for over 5 months now. The closing mechanism is loud when you shut it (esp. at 3am). The top is heavy making bag changing tricky (but I've learned how to handle it). There are no ordors! (only when I have to open it up to change out the bag) The fan is quite and really works for me. I would recommend this to friends, if ordor is their main concern. The fan and filters work so well. (it smells so bad when I have to change out the bag) A big plus for us is that it uses regular bags. Also, my husband didn't like having to shove a dirty diaper down a twist tube thing. It is cleaner to place the diaper in and simply close it down."
5,Love this pail!,"I see that this pail has received poor reviews. My family has had a very different experience! It is loud when it is closed, as the mechanism snaps shut to eliminate odors. My husband and I were a bit put off by the loudness at first, but we got over it when we realized we had a VERY low maintenance pail that had a near-silent internal fan that WORKS!!! There have never been diaper pail odor issues in our nursery/home. We love that we can use regular kitchen trash bags! We replace the carbon deodorizer filter at the recommended time. The fan inside the pail is VERY quiet and will not disturb slumber. Many people question whether it's working--if you listen VERY closely, you can hear it...and if you're not having stink issues, it's working! We love it."
1,disturbing,"This was a difficult book to read. While it's nice to read about a strong heroine, it's another to read about an unreasonable brat, which is what Cricket was. This woman was like a plague leaving destruction and mayhem in her wake. It was unrealistic that she could be the reason for her sister-in-law's tragedy and not only did she not face any consequences, but she did not learn a lesson and she continued on as before. I am happy that this wasn't the first book I read from JJ... it would have been my last."
3,Cricket,"Cricket's father prepared her for the life in the young republic of Texas. Cricket could take care of her self and had no use for men. Jarrett a Texas Ranger rescues Cricket from the Comanche Indians. Then the sparks fly. This is a fast moving book that involves a scheme that may involve Crickets' sisters. You will keep turning the pages of this book. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
4,A riveting story that grips from the first page.,"Creighton ""Cricket"" Stewart is the youngest of Rip Stewart's unusual daughters. He dreamed of having sons, sons whose futures he had planned. Each of his daughters is different and Cricket is his favorite, the child of his heart. She is rough-and tumble, can ride and shoot, fight and curse with the toughest man. Until she meets Jarrett Creed, a Texas Ranger with ties to the Comanche. I like the way the author made the heroine strong (at a time when women were treated as the gentler, weaker sex) yet believable. Creed is the perfect match for Cricket and gets her to see that, despite her rugged upbringing, she is forever and always, a woman. This story made me anxious to read the next in the series."
1,Boring,I was really bored by this book. I have read other of Joan's books and enjoyed them greatley but this one put me to sleep. (I LOVED Sloan's story.) I didnt understand the father charachter at all. Does he love his children???? It doesnt show in the book. I never really got in touch with Cricket at all. THere was so much historical detail written that she forgot to deeply involve us with the characters. I ended up putting down the book about half way through.
3,Doesn't fit the kid I bought it for,"I got this for my 3-year-old to go with the new bike she got for Christmas, but the helmet is too small for her. The elbow and knee pads fit fine, but I have to get her a different set ASAP. It's a good thing I have a younger daughter to hand it down to in brand-new condition. It's cute, and seems to be well-made, so the 1-year-old will be able to use it for at least a year or so."
2,Not so great.,"The helmet is okay, except for the strap to go under the chin. It does not have a seat for the chin or that area. So the strap which is nylon by the way, will be quite uncomfortable.The set only comes with one set of pads, not two sets as shown on the picture, which can either be used as elbow or knee pads. The pads also cannot fit securely on the elbow or knee and will slip around. the nylon straps also squeeze the limbs and leave impressions on your skin.Not recommended."
1,Safety? Almost.,"I purchased this helmet and elbow / kneepad for our granddaughter for her birthday. The helmet was ok, sort of. The suspension system was difficult to adjust and the chinstrap connector pinched her neck when it was engaged. A Velcro closure for the chinstrap would have been more appropriate. As for the elbow / kneepads, they had a hard plastic bubble type fixture that provided protection for those particular joints but they did not allow the pads to flex and bend because it was one piece and rigid. This item seemed to be made for and more appropriately used by her to play dress up with her doll babies that would never actually be riding. Definitely not designed for what it supposed to do. I would return the item but being her age she does not understand why grandpa would take her present away from her. I would definitely NOT recommend this product and will be buying her functional equipment locally."
3,Who do these knee pads fit?,"The helmet fits fine and seems to work well. My daughter loves the princess design. The protective pads on the other hand are very small and very uncomfortable for her. My daughter is petite and was 2 and 1/2 when we got the set, so I was not expecting things to be small."
3,Not too bad but it ain't Oakenfold,"I was under the impression the CD set is mixed by Paul Oakenfold when I bought it. It turns out it was done by someone else, even the mastering!!! I don't really know what is his involvement in this. The tracks are ok, so is the mixing. Sorry guys, I have to say it is NOT a must have item."
3,Great Quality,"I was impressed with the quality of this blu-ray DVD. The only problem is the only option is to play the movie, thats it. No chapters, scenes or settings at all."
3,Gamera,Good Movie but distracted by the Japanese dialogue and the English subtitles. Bought at an inexpensive price for a Blu Ray. Can't beat B-R with a stick.
4,two of the modern gameras look great here.,If you are a fan of the japanese giant monster flicks you'll love these two movies.And the effects are way above what this character had back in the 1960's to boot. THere are no extra features but I can live with that when I get TWO movies for a good price and they look great too! The blu ray is loads above the standard dvd release and that's another plus.
3,"Giant Flaming, Flying Turtle - Oh My","A reboot of the classic movies from the 1960s, the new Gamera films are lot's of fun. Once you get past the concept of a gigantic flying turtle (rocket propelled) that walks on 2 legs, the underlying stories aren't bad. Great special effects and good image quality on the blu-ray version. Worth buying for the price. Now if they would just release Gamera vs. Iris."
4,Dr. Gamera Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Fall Of Tokyo,"I love Japanese monster movies, you can put them on day or night and know your gonna see some city usually Tokyo under attack and these two films don't let you down, well done Mill Creek for the price this is a pretty good blu-ray."
4,Two-thirds of an amazing kaiju trilogy,"These films are the first two in a trilogy of amazing kaiju films reinventing the goofy, but wholly entertaining Gamera of the 1960s and 70s into a serious, action-packed drama spanning the course of three films.Video quality is superb on Gamera: Guardian of the Universe. While the quality is also very good on ""Advent of Legion"", dark scenes come out a bit grainy. Sound quality is fantastic on both.Unfortunately, this set drops a star for me due to a complete lack of extras. Would have been nice to have seen at least something from the special feature-packed Japanese releases. However, according to the producers of this new bluray disc, Mill Creek, the third film will include some extras, perhaps making up for the lack of them on this release."
4,A Great Blu-ray!,"Gamera's first BD release in the US is great. While not entirely perfect, as it's lacking any extras and other small flaws, the video is excellent and audio very good as well. My only complaint, as stated, are the lack of extras, and some of the onscreen Japanese text goes untranslated (all of the dialogue is subtitled, though). Given the extremely cheap price and quality I'd highly recommend this to all kaiju fans, and monster fans in general. These are two of the best Gamera films and the BD quality only makes them better."
3,So-so,"I'm a big fan of Grafton's but I didn't think ""N is for Noose"" was all that great. Actually, I found it kind of boring and didn't race through it as I usually do. I didn't care about the characters and missed the old ones. The ending was too far fetched. But most of all, I missed Kinsey's sarcastic wit! I imagine it must be hard to come up with fresh ideas after so many novels so I wish Grafton good luck!"
5,Grafton keeps getting better and better,"I don't understand how an author can still manage to conceive a story after thirteen novels, but Grafton has done it again. If anything, her writing style improves with age. Grafton has penned one of the most memorable/quotable lines I've ever read when describing the Sierra-Nevada mountain range as ""breathtaking by those who are easily winded."" I enjoyed N is for Noose as much if not more than A through M, and am eagerly anticipating O through Z."
4,like wearing an old pair of slippers,"Entering into the world of Kinsey Milhone at this point, is like going home. While it may not always fill you with what you need, it still satisfies. Sue Grafton has allowed her latest books to be a little ""darker"" than her earlier works, and as always, Kinsey is sharp, quick, and clever. No author can keep compete with the best of her works, but Sue Grafton manages to come close. While this book was not quite as absorbing as her ""k"" and ""l"" books, I still found it enjoyable."
2,Start with A,"If you want to enjoy a Kinsey Milhone mystery, read the early ones. I listened to this book on a long driving trip. If I hadn't been a captive audience with no radio or tape alternatives, I never would have made it to page 100. BOORRRINNG!! No plot, no mystery, repetitious dull details. My feeling is that Grafton's publisher insists she write 300 page books so that they can make more money off her. They can't charge as much for 200 pagers that would have the snap and sizzle of her early works. Come on Grafton! Give your readers a break and speak up to those twerps in New York. Half of them don't know what a mystery is."
3,A Wife's Closure,"Tom Newquist died from a heart attack. He had not taken care of himself but his wife wanted to know what had caused him so much concern the six months before he died. Kinsey's investigation wasn't turning up anything but she kept on probing. She found herself in great danger trying to find closure for Newquist's wife. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above the River"""
3,**Shocked**,"I had to read this book for a literature class and like most reading assignments, I was not looking forward to it. Once I got a couple pages into the book, I could not put it down. The crazy situations Kinsey gets herself into made it hard to stop flipping through the pages. The intense description Grafton uses on Kinsey's injuries turned my stomach. I was in total suspense up to the last page. I would recommend this book to any one! I truly enjoyed it, I hope you do to!"
3,"N is for ""Not the best way to start the series""","This was my first Grafton read, and it did not live up to the accolades for the series I've heard from devotees. Our protagonist isn't investigating a crime, she's trying to find out what was bothering a small-town Sheriff's investigator in the weeks before he died of a heart attack. Of course, crime comes looking for her, but the wind-up at the end left me wondering what the big deal was all about?Perhaps this is more like what PIs encounter in real life."
3,Slow Reading,"This book seemed slow, but unlike other slow books I kept on plugging through it. The part about her book that bothered me most was the fact that there was no way the reader could have figured the mystery out. There were really no hints. I think a good mystery should be fair to the reader. It should provide enough information and hints that the reader has a fair chance of solving the mystery."
2,Kinsey doesn't run much anymore!,I usually eagerly await the next letter of the alphabet. But no more. A major disappointment throughout. Kinsey always made me feel good but she's lost her bounce. The location seemed riddled with facts that jarred my memory of California and proved a distraction. The contrivances to get her out of town were just plain boring! The rest of the cast of characters didn't do anything to perk it up.
2,yawn...,this is the sort of mystery novel that requires absolutely no brains to solve. a complete waste of time. the plot is tired and Kinsey is simply annoying.
1,Tired and Perfunctory,"This is the 14th Kinsey Milhone book, and I've read them all with steadily decreasing delight. I just wish that in this outing Grafton had been able to remember that Kinsey is a California native..."
2,N is for No!,"I started to read this and I had to staple my eyes open to keep myself from not reading. the plot moved so slow that my only hope was that a great ending was my reward for passing this pacience killer. Bummer. The ending was short and ridiculous. One would have to back to and retrace through the book to try to understand the ending. It was the first book I had read by Kinsey, and probably the last."
1,A comic book of a novel,"Grafton's writing is dull, formulaic, and unrealistic. Her characters are from the one-dimensional, connect-the-dot trash heap. N is for Noose is further undermined by scenes drawn from a simpleton's vision of reality. For example, Kinsey is trapped in her motel room while a thug breaks in... and what happens? The guy pins her on the ground and then dislocates two of her fingers. What a brute! We could only hope a similar experience might befall Ms. Grafton and keep her away from the keyboard where she threatens to belt out more of her ""literature."" After all of the overblown discriptions are removed and a decent editor cuts a hundred pages, N is for Noose can be viewed as a short story that deserves a C- in high school composition. Please Sue, get a full-time job at UCSB and save everyone from your next ""novel."""
2,BORING!!!,"the alphabet books are some of my very favorite mysteries.....'m is for malice' is definitely my very favorite and the book with the most substance of them alllllll.......sue grafton used to come out with a new book every May...kinsey's birthday...and then with the 'L' book it was later in the year as was the case with the wonderful 'M' book but with the 'N' book, she totallllly blew it in more ways than one! not only was it almost a year over-due but it was a long short story...shallow characters....who cared about them? who cared about the story.....???? just a waste of paper, time and energy.....note to sue grafton: reread your fabulous ""M"" book and see what real writing is all about!!!! hopefullly the ""O"" book will succeed where ""N"" failed!!!!!"
1,Disappointed!,"After reading other authors in the genre, I decided to give Grafton a try with N is for Noose. The first 50 pages were tiresome... but I kept going. The next 50 pages were boring... kept reading, waiting for something to happen. Around page 135 I gave up... the entire book is consumed with uninteresting details that seem to lead nowhere. Closed the book and watched a Columbo movie... which was actually enjoyable after this tedious book. I'm not even interested to see how it ended."
3,Not one of her best,"I was excited when I found a paperback copy of this book at the library. What luck! Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the contents. This one was really predicatable and smacked of someone who has gone through the routine too many times. I fervently hope that this is not the case. Sue Grafton has too much potential to waste."
1,Yawn,"I picked up this book while I was traveling, hoping to find something nice and easy that would occupy me while the plane zoomed through the air towards home. Big bummer. I finished it only because I was stuck on the plane without anything else (I even read the in-flight magazine, yikes!).I can't beleive that this is a ""best selling"" mystery! Pallid, forgettable characters that even the author seems bored of. Cheesy scenes that felt like they were straight from a made for TV movie.And the ending! Please! Maybe Ms. Grafton should take a break for a while and get the juices flowing again."
2,The plot was uninteresting and the final scene absurd.,"I found myself very bored from before the middle of the book, but plugged along. Thus, the final scene was particularly infuriating as it made no sense, insult to injury. How did the mind-altering drug get in the brownies? If Brant put it there, how does one account for the plate he supposedly ate off? Would his mother have done this? Really the last chapter is a slap together, hodge-podge."
2,Too many meaningless words and descriptions.,"Having read all of the alphabet mysteries, I can say that this one was weak. So little happened. Sue Grafton has done so much better in others. I wonder if publishers are asking for more words!"
3,"Wonderful style, disappointing denouement","The latest Kinsey Millhone mystery is beautifully written. I am a writer myself, and Ms. Grafton's style is so smooth and sassy that it occasionally brings tears of envy to my eyes! That said, I thought that the plot of ""N"" needed pepping up somehow. It was obvious to me who the murderer was from the person's first scene. Most of all, I was astonished to realize that Kinsey is still chronicling her adventures from 1987!! I'd say the next few novels should bring her into the nineties. There's something about the mystery supposedly taking place 12 years ago that renders it a little less than exciting."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"No one in this book is very likable, not even the usually likable Kinsey. She wasn't very interested in the case, which made it hard for me to be interested. The small mountain town setting had all kinds of possibilities, none of which materialized. Rafer could had been explored more: for instance, how come a small town law enforcement official wears cashmere sweaters? I just didn't care about any of the characters, which spells disaster for a mystery (or any other kind of) story. It read like a book gone to press just to satisfy a deadline."
2,N is for Needed More,"I have been a Kinsey Millhone fan from the beginning. However, N is for Noose left so much unexplained. My main question when I closed the book was ""Who was Judy Gelson's lover and did that have anything to do with anything???"" I have lots of other questions but hesitate to reveal too much of the plot here. It was very confusing in some spots, where peripheral characters all of a sudden became major players. Not one of Ms. Grafton's best. However, I'll look forward to ""O is for Outlaw"" with enthusiasm, hoping it will be a more satisfying read."
1,N is for Not-Very-Good,"I have been a big Kinsey fan since the first ""A,"" But there was very little here to recommend. The only reason I finished it was because I took it on a long plane flight and didn't bring an alternative. No plot, boring characters, a tired-out narrator. I hope Grafton is back up to speed on ""O,"" or it will be ""O for Over and Out"" for this reader."
3,Great book but often is not En Espanol.,"We have tried 2 times to order this item, in Spanish and each time it arrives as the English paperback. It is not that I do not like the Grafton books, own them all, but I really wish there was a way to check and make sure the book is the Spanish Edition that I need."
3,"Good writing, loose plot","I really enjoyed Grafton's writing, but the story here meandered a bit too much for my liking. There was too much ""murky middle"" between the set-up and the resolution.I read an early book in this series years and years ago. I barely remember anything about it, so I can't compare ""N is for Noose"" it to the rest of the series. I'm glad to hear that other books are better, because I look forward to reading another Grafton novel."
4,Great fare but not the best,"I'd really give this 4 1/2 stars because it was still suspenseful despite some moments of slowness. I didn't really enjoy the catalyst for Kinsey's case, Selma - Grafton probably intended that since many of the townfolk felt the same. I prefer Kinsey when she works from Santa Teresa, but the townfolk of Nota Lake were at least interesting. And I had to chuckle when Kinsey fired up that iron - it may not have worked, but there's ingenuity at its best! Enjoyable, especially if you're going through the series like I am."
2,Not one of Grafton's better efforts.,"Unlike the preceding 13 novels in this series, Millhone is having a week of rather bad hair days in this one and it shows. It spite of her usually optimistic approach to life, Millone is pessimistic throughout. I would hope this isn't what the rest of the series is going to be like.Not a particularly good novel."
3,Not Grafton's best but still entertaining.,"I have read all of Ms. Grafton's books through N is for Noose. I agree with most of the readers that this was not her best work. However, Kinsey is so endearing to those of us who ""know"" her that the book was still enjoyable. I will continue to read this series and I am looking forward to ""O."""
5,Another fabulously entertaining case with Kinsey Millhone.,"N is for Noose is one of the best Grafton mysteries yet. The mystery Kinsey is hired to solve is a nice change of pace and Grafton makes it interesting from the first interview with the client. As usual, Grafton brings the characters to life in a way that enables you to visualize them down to their dental work. The story picks up momentum at breakneck speed in the last few chapters, whisking you to an action-packed, surprise ending. N is for Noose whets your appetite for the next irresistable Grafton work."
4,How can one NOT like Kinsey Millhone?,"I really, really like Sue Grafton's alter-ego, Kinsey Millhone. After all, how can you NOT like someone who has the courage to cut her own hair with cuticle scissors?Maybe this wasn't one of Grafton's most thrilling or intriguing mysteries, but it certainly affirms Kinsey's tenancity once she gets ""on"" a case, albeit a weak one with few clues.Anyone from the 60's will enjoy the climax...the criminal should have known that Kinsey is at her best when cornered, be it by humans or chemicals.I have one entire shelf dedicated to Kinsey....and I eagerly await each new release. Kinsey Millhone is someone I would like to know.Keep up the good work!"
3,Plodding Plotting Prevents PI from Piquing Previous Passion,"Ordinarily I love Sue Grafton and Kinsey Millhone. Kinsey is one of the best developed characters in mystery history. And yet, with her latest endeavor, Grafton presents a plot so bogged down in minutiae that the reader is hard-pressed to continue on to page 100 when something finally happens. I long for the excitement I came to expect from A is for Alibi. When I read that book, I gasped rather immediately and didn't exhale until the very last sentence. Now, THAT was writing!!"
2,N is for noose,"the book is really slow, or should i say s-l-o-w. it really lack the intensity of a mystery book. i like books with a grip n is for the birds.it had a few moments, but very boring."
2,Boring,"This is definitely not one of Grafton's best efforts. Usually I find it hard to put her books down. Through the first half of the book, I was finding it hard to pick it up. Hopefully 'O' will be better."
4,I LOVE ENDINGS LIKE THIS!,"Fast reading, quick paced, surprise ending! I'm glad that Sue kept old characters out of book, (not that I don't love Rosy and Henry and Dietz) but this worked without them...AND think how much fun we'll have finding out what they were all doing why she was covering this case!"
4,Kinsey fan,"I'm a fan of Kinsey Milhone and although this wasn't the best book in the series, I enjoyed it. Light reading with a puzzle to be solved, and Kinsey does just that. I recommend it for anyone who likes a mystery to read at bedtime, this is a good book as it's easy to read a chapter and put down until next time."
5,Oldie but goodie,"This was an old book on tape, but there were no problems with listening to it. I enjoyed it very much."
3,Good,Love Sue Grafton addicted to Kinsey always getting what she wants can't wait for the next book and the rest of the next books
3,Not the best of Kinsey Milhone,"I am a big fan of Kinsey, but N is not my favorite by far. I missed the familiarity of recurring characters and locations. Sue Grafton did not seem to portray Kinsey as her usual self assured character. Missing something."
2,"1st book read by Sue Grafton, a real disappointment!","I liked the sense of humor that the author projected in this story. I thought it was neat the way she mixed the mystery and the humor together. However I was very disappointed in the ending of this book. I have to agree with the reviewer from California May 27, 1999 that said ""the plot was uninteresting and the final scene absurd"". I couldn't believe that after investing so much time and effort in following all the clues set forth in this story, the author would end it so abruptly? Ms. Grafton owed the reader a better explaination of what happened. I feel that I ultimately understood the ending, but I resented having to go back and re-read it over and over to get it. The story moved very slowly and I felt there should have been a pay off at the end for exercising such patients, unfortunately there wasn't. I will try some of Ms. Grafton's earlier work, but this story was not up to the usual standards of what I like to read."
2,"A slow, disappointing read with a contrived ending.","I was very disappointed in this slow moving book. I am a big fan of Kinsey and was looking forward to reading of her latest adventure. It took FOREVER for the story to get moving. The characters were described in great and often tedious detail but somehow seemed one-dimensional. The premise was uninteresting, a woman's husband dies of a heart attack but was upset about something before he died...???!!! It took will power and curiosity to keep going. I kept thinking that it would get better, that I would be intrigued, that I was wrong about the person I suspected. Unfortunately when I got to the let's throw all the answers and action into one unbelievable chapter ending, I slammed the book closed in disgust. I hope that 'O' will make me want to bother with 'P'..."
3,I was disappointed in the next installment of Kinsey,Kinsey seems to have lost her spunk and sixth sense when she gets her fingers broken by someone trying to break into her apartment and places herself in harm's way when the killer had killed two people why not Kinsey. Plot was not fully developed and the solution was not fully explained. Not as good as M for Malice. If Kinsey keeps being a dumb detective she won't make it to Z. I will add a paperback edition to my library but not Grafton's best.
3,Kinsey solves the case but reveals little of herself.,"After sharing so many cases with Kinsey and crew, it becomes difficult to read about the case alone. I want more clues to her character - what motivates her actions. I would like to see Kinsey grow as a person, but that just doesn't seem to be happening. Yet, the writing is clean and eacy to ready and it is still a fun journey."
1,Without Judy Kaye to read it ... a real dud!!!,"I only listen to audio books and I have loved every single Sue Grafton book until ""N"" .. it was too long, rambled on ... and it didn't have Judy Kaye to read it .... JUDY KAYE 'IS' KINSEY. I don't know what happened to Judy Kaye but she needs to come back! She could have saved ""N"" ... Hope ""O"" has everything back like it's supposed to be!"
2,N is for Noosr,"I have read all the Grafton novel through N and I think ahe broke the rule of one too many. The story was very slow ans Kinsey didn,t seem too bright. It was not her kind of case and I don,t know why she took it. I will give O a try to see if Grafton can regain my favor."
2,No Spark,"The premise of this story was a good one, but the telling of it was lackluster. I was disappointed in M Is For Malice as well. I think I'll forgo O Is For Outlaw unless the reviews are very, very good."
2,Save your money,"This is the only really disappointing book in this series. Kinsey's so dumb she apparently never figures out who the two most likely suspects are, since she keeps blabbing to them, and the motive finally ascribed to one of them is vague in the extreme. In fact, very little of the plot is believable."
2,N is For Not Much,"Kinsey while striving perhaps to be more ""mature"" fails in the lack of sassiness, I have come to love. N does not possess these qualities. It seems to drag and does not contain much suspense."
1,wha???,"(audio version)That about sums up my reaction to most of this book. It was slow, overly descriptive (I fastforwarded through large sections without missing plot details...), and schizophrenic in plot. Like many other reviewers, I also was disappointed in the ending...the killer is just suddenly identified and then nothing explained, just stated. The ""plot"" was much too random to follow and Kinsey was presented as a complete idiot. This is the only Sue Grafton book I have read and I hope her others are better because this one was a waste of time."
3,A little bit of a let-down,"Like most of the readers, I was a little disappointed with ""N"". It was a tad bit boring until the rapid end. But it was all worth it to know that Robert Dietz is still in Kinsey's life. I for one think they're perfect for each other and hope they're still together in ""O""."
2,I waited so long and I was really disappointed.....,"I have been a fan of Kinsey Malone since I first started reading the series, but I have to say I was truly disappointed in this one. She completely forgot to mention much about her old neighbor...it was almost like he never existed! It really didn't hold your interest for that long. I sure hope if the next book is an O it will be a lot better that this one."
2,The most disappointing and ineffective tale of the Series!,"If you're truly a Kinsey Milhone fan, you would think N is for Noose was written by someone other than Sue Grafton. The story never left the ground and the ""pals"" we've all become so familiar with in the series were nearly nonexistent. The plot was trite, lacked imagination and never was a mystery from the inception. One hates to feel so cheated after enjoying our heroine and the series from A to N. Better luck next time, Sue. A better editor would never have let this one off the press."
2,Wished for more,"This book was not very good at all! It was very slow. I found myself skipping many of the descriptions of weather and scenery, and I don't think I missed anything. I was quite disappointed and can't figure out why it made the bestseller list. I expected more from this author. I don't know if I will read the next one."
3,Even Kinsey gets a dog of a case once in a while.,"I've read every one of Grafton's books (in sequence, even) and I have to agree with the consensus that this isn't one of her best. Why? The small town setting, where everyone's either a cop or a waitress seemed phoney. And I didn't see the point in her running home to Santa Teresa -- it seemed like a device to drag in her local cast of characters in for a couple of chapters, and they were pretty wooden old props in this volume, weren't they? I hope that this book is an aberration and that the next one will get back on the right track, but Grafton might be excused if it's becoming harder to breathe life into her characters -- it's happened to many a mystery writer."
2,This is definitely not one of her better books!,"I kept waiting and waiting for some action to occur in this one! I felt fairly cold, most of the time, as I read this one, because Grafton's descriptions went on and on about the cold, sleet, snow, etc. I did not figure out the murderer, until it was obvious, so, she did do a good job, keeping me in suspense about that. Although, I would not read this one again, I will of course read the next, and hope that the plot is a little more exciting!"
3,N is for Not the Best of the Bunch,"Let's face it. Kinsey's not the same without the all-purpose black dress, or at least a passing conversation with one of the following: Vera Lipton, Lonnie Kingman, Jonah Robb. She's at her best when lying her way through a charade she's concocted to get into someone's house or past someone's secretary. Here, it was like everyone else had her moves all figured out way, way before she did. Of course, that's how it is in a small town. You sneeze and everyone says ""God bless you."" I borrowed this from the library. Maybe, if the paperback is on discount, I'll go ahead and buy it just so I can someday say I've got the whole alphabet series. But that'd be the only reason. It was an OK read, but I probably wouldn't read it again, and next to K is for Killer, the one I'd least recommend to a new Sue Grafton fan. Sue is a fellow native Kentuckian, and I hate to speak evil of her, but I sure hope Kinsey gets her groove back in O:)"
2,Disappointed and unfulfilled by my weakened heroine,"Just finishing ""N"", I am unhappy that I had solved the crime long before Kinsey and was railing at her sloppy fact-checking and detective work. Usually I can count on Ms. Millhone to give me a boost for female-kind, but this time she left me embarrassed and sad. Maybe she needs a major career change, she seems unable to deal with the stress of her job as she gets older. Even though I hate to lose Kinsey, it might be time for Ms. Grafton to take time off or try writing another character for awhile to get fresh perspective. I'd hate to see her go the way of Robert B. Parker (who I love, but his last few years don't match up to his first few)."
2,Reading it was like trying to climb a greased pole!,"Sue Grafton has always delivered a good read, one that I can usually count on to keep me engrossed while traveling. Not ""N"" is for Noose, more like ""N"" was for numbing...oh well, I guess even a good author has to turn out a turkey every now and then! Get Kinsey out of her coma and back to her usual self - quick!"
2,Disappointing installment in an otherwise enjoyable series.,"I was very disappointed by this book. The villain was fairly obvious and the story seemed overly long. None of the new characters were well developed and we get no further insight into Kinsey. I was only mildly interested in the solution and the methods used to reach it were usually simplistic - if they lie to you the first time, they're obligated to tell the truth the second time, etc. Hopefully more thought will be put into the next installment, or we'll never reach 'Z'."
3,big sam's review for N is for NOOSE,I read N is for Noose by Sue Grafton. I thought it was an excellent book with a very good and exciting plot. I have read some of Sue Graftons other books and this one is the best so far. The book starts out with Kinsey coming to the town of Nota Lake. She gets there and gets hurt and injured and realizes that nobody in the town really likes her being there. She is atacked badly but she recovers quickly. I found it hard at the end when she was solving the mystery with all the complications and numbers and technical stuff but other than that it was great.
5,Great mysteries,Sue Grafton writes THE BEST mysteries! After reading one we went back to the beginning and got them all. Each one is really good. Hate to catch up.
5,Classic Kinsey,N for Noose is another classic Kinsey Millhone mystery from the author. It keeps you guessing to the last few pages as to Whodunnit and why.
3,Hard knocks for Kinsey,"Kinsey is investigating the death of a Sherriff's investigator Tom Newquist, whose widow believes he was under undue stress at the time of his passing. She wants to know who, what, and why.Kinsey gets some hard knocks along the way and maybe Mrs. Newquist would have been better off not knowing?"
2,I didn't get the ending,"I'm confused about the ending -- did the ex-con really attack Rafer's daughter? Was that the motive for Brandt's killings? Or, if the attack was made-up to get Kinsey to suspect Rafer, where's the motive? I've read most of the Millhone series, and I thought this one was a dud."
2,Wordy digressions distract from already weak plot line,"N is for Not Worth the Time it takes to Read. Starting with an implausible hiring premise, Sue Grafton fritters away the reader's patience with irrelevant set pieces like Rosie's birthday party, a Barbie doll collection, and endlessly repeated discussions of Kinsey's tastes in clothing and food. These efforts could better have been spent in making the plot more complex and more coherent."
3,"OK, but she's done better.","If I were not a committed reader of this series, and if the first page of the story had not hit home, and if I had not been stuck in a motel, I doubt I would have had the patience to wade through the slow first part of this book. But it gets better! And while I had some suspicions of who was responsible, I could not figure out a reasonable motive until it was revealed. Not the best mystery I've read this year, but far from the worst."
2,N is Not Grafton's Best,"I must agree with other reviewers that ""N is for Noose"" is well below par for Sue Grafton. I think Ms. Grafton is attempting to ""round out"" Kinsey - she attempted this in N by having Kinsey become frightened after an attack. Sure, show that Kinsey is human and gets scared like the rest of us but do not forsake the other elements of her character, especially her sarcastic wit, while doing so. As with the last few Grafton books, K is for Killer, L is for Lawless and now N is for Noose, I find that I neither care about the problems of the characters (M is for Malice was the exception to this) nor do I care about the resolution of the case. Perhaps Ms. Grafton should go back and read her earlier works to help herself devise more interesting plots for the remaining novels in the series. This reader strongly feels that unless the quality of plot strengthens significantly, I'll stop reading (and buying) Ms. Grafton's books long before she makes it to Z."
5,A DELIGHTFUL CHANGE!,"What delightful change, and a pleasantly remarkable book. Gerry Spence, the great trial lawyer, who has wowed us with his brilliance in the courtrooom and his rustic biting commentary on Larry King and the Geraldo Rivera televised shows gives us a book on parenting. It is humorous filled with tips for fathers and sons to spend quality time together. This legal giant shares his own brand of fatherhood and revisits the ""boy"" in himself.Enjoyable reading."
4,It's what they don't say that matters,"At first this album didn't really hit me, but then as I was listening to it again the other day, and I realized how good it really is. Although Tenderfoot is subtle and unsuspecting initially, it becomes obvious after a few listens that the magic is in what they DON'T say. I can't wait to see Without Gravity live!!"
4,This album is a lullaby for the heart and soul.,"If you like Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, Damien Rice and Rocco DeLuca (with or without the burden) then there is no reason why Tenderfoot shouldn't be in your mailbox waiting for you to open it up, import it on your itunes and be on your way to a blissfull melancholy state of mind before the sun goes down. These guys take the bare essentials and form excellent music out of it. No drum machines, no raps, nobody else writing there music. Pure sound. Dim the lights, burn some incense and turn this on for a feeling of solitude within the mind."
3,3.5 stars for a gorgeously lush album,"Beautiful Son is one of the most pure songs I've heard in awhile, and it nicely sets up the rest of the album. Amazing vocals wrapped around haunting music entranced in more than subtle melodies. You almost forget that there are lyrics to these songs.It's easy to get lost in the atmosphere of these songs. I sometimes might be a little too critical with my star ratings, but I just can't go around giving out 4 stars willy nilly, I mean, goodness, what would the children think?"
1,wrong stuff,"Item pictured was NOT the item I got. I wanted the older version, as pictured, but got the newer one. Very dissatisfied."
2,"Technically a Chillout CD - But in Reality, Incorrectly Named","A ""chillout"" CD (album) these days is really correctly identified as dance tracks with light beats to cool off (chill) after a night of heavy house or trance - true chillout songs can range from folktronica like EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL or DIDO to trance tracks with slower beats - this CD is really not in that genre.This CD is really in the relaxation/background/""muzak"" genre. And that's fine if that's what you want but it is not a proper ""chillout"" CD. For dance CD buyers looking for a real chillout CD to close out the evening - this is NOT that kind of CD and you will sorely be disappointed in this unoffensive background music CD.If you're programming music for a quiet store on a Sunday morning, this will offend no one and it is that kind of chillout CD but for those looking for a true chillout CD - this is the wrong one to get."
2,way too bulky,"(...) ... however, the picture is misleading, this thing is way too thick and bulky for a cd case. the binding is like 4 inches big of stiff cardboard, making it inconvenient to travel with or put anywhere, it would ahve gotten one star except that it was so cheap, myabe im overexaggerating on the importance of size but to me, thats an important part of any cd case"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"i am very satisfied with this product. After only a few days, I can feel an improvement in my joints and touch wood, no side effectsCH-Alpha - Joint & Cartilage Health - New Generation Formula (1 month supply)"
5,The Deepest Most Life Changing Book Ever,"I dont know what to say...I am in awe.This book is one of the best books I've ever read...no it's not, it's the BEST book I've ever read. That's all I can say because I'm so taken back by the contents of the magnificent book!"
3,Larger than you might think,Well made product. The Appetizer in Ice was a larger then I needed. But still a great product. Keep foods nice and chilled.
2,College must read,This was a required reading for grandson in college. Not what we enjoy reading on a regular basis at all.
2,"Grossly, Grossly Overwritten","My new favorite state is Colorado and I wanted to know more.The author is an extremely prolific writer, unfortunately watering down an extremely interesting subject. He basically brags somewhere in the Forward or Introduction that when he and friends come to an intersection, he'll go into the complete history of that location. I guess he's more in love with his style than we are. You'll find yourself skimming very soon into the book, wishing it wasn't written kind of in a novel style with too much information. It's a thick book. If the unnecessary filler stuff wasn't in it, it would read better. Too bad, Colorado is not boring by any stretch, but this book is."
2,"Boring, for scholars or students only!!","This may be an important work in it's field, but it is, sadly, quite boring. I began skimming it at about page 50 and finished it that way. I read a lot of history for pleasure and derived none from this book. I could only recommend it to scholars or students."
2,Dissapointing,I bought this out of curiosity and was dissapointed to find out its mainly catering to older viewers. This is for people who have absolutely no clue about Puerto Rico and are first time travelers. Not very helpful or exciting in my opinion.
1,waste of time and money,The video lasted about 40 mins. full of interviews with people on vacation (which i dont care about bob and judy from nj) and it named about 5 things to do in puerto rico. 2 of which even older people told me not to waste my time with.
3,The Ghost Of Trout Fishing In America,"Richard Brautigan's dark side is everywhere evident in this short novel about how marginalized he felt when a woman hanged herself while another was dying of cancer. This is not Brautigan's best, no matter what some of the other reviewers claim. It is best read as a companion piece to his daughter's memoir. Ianthe Brautigan wonders why her father committed suicide and explores a number of reasons. They are all here in the last book by Brautigan, written a couple of years before he shot himself. It's sad. America should take better care of its writers. There are hints, in this novel, of Brautigan at his best, and it makes you wish -- more than ever -- he was still in the land of the living, cranking out more Brautigan originals."
4,Eerie in the context of Brautigan's life,"This was the last book Richard Brautigan wrote before he committed suicide. Reading with that in mind, this book takes on an eeriness and relevance otherwise missing. It is written in the form of a travel journal, a real journal, with long periods of missing entries. But the crux of this book lies in the narrator's attempt to understand death. The house he currently rents was previously owned by a woman who killed herself there. The narrator also has a good friend who is losing her battle with cancer. It's as if Brautigan was wrestling with the idea of death. Whether his suicide means he figured it out, or failed to, is unknown. This book is a better look into his final years than a good story, but it's full of typical Brautigan humor and wonderful writing."
4,long time no see,"When was the last time that I read Brautigan's books or read about him. It was probably when Jan Kerouac's ""Trainsong"" was translated into Japanese almost ten years ago. Jack Kerouac's daughter described Brautigan's lecture in Amsterdam a year before he died. Jan Kerouac passed away too in mid-nineties.Now this Brautigan's posthumous book reminds me of an atmosphere of early eighties; not too much industrialization and 'do it ourselves.' But this book is not so simple. The narrator went to cemeteries everywhere. And every time he tried to talk about an ""unfortunate woman"" who hung herself, he got off the subject. Hatred for LA-style cities, the sound of a woman making love in Berkeley, a photograph of him and a chicken in Hawaii, etc. These episodes are funny but, on the other hand, somewhat depressing.Nostalgic, witty and a little sad. It's unmistakably a Brautigan."
3,"DECENT, BUT BUY THE EARLIER BRAUTIGAN BOOKS.","This is a quick read, so it's worth reading. I have enjoyed all his books. If you want to experience Richard at his best, read: TROUT FISHING IN AMERICA, REVENGE OF THE LAWN, DREAMING OF BABYLON.....just to name a few."
4,Nice read for Brautigan fans,"I enjoyed this short book from Brautigan. I believe it was his last work before his unfortunate demise. He has a unique style, wit and humor that sets him apart."
4,this is the only brautigan book i wouldnt give 5 stars to,"granted its still an amazing piece of literature it just didnt have me wrapped around like the rest.pick this book up, but dont let it be the first or second book of his you read."
3,Poor return policy,"Ordered wrong item, upon trying to return, it did not fall within return policy Though I recieved product quickly. Also, No response to feedback."
5,works well,The bulb keeps fungus and bacteria out of the water keeping it safe to breath the moisturized air.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!,"For those who have light bladder leakage, these long & light Poise pads are great!! I have to wear them 24/7, and they work so much better than other brands do. I never have to worry about them tearing like some brands do. I love how they are wrapped, which makes it so easy to carry along in my purse. And, thank you Amazon for automatically shipping these to me every three months, as I don't have to worry about the stores not carrying this particular item or being out of them. The regular delivery was a life saver when I had my surgery and couldn't get out."
2,Liners,Liners are great. They are the right size for those occasional mishaps. Great for taking care of the odor too.
1,They changed them!,"I too have used these for years. They are perfect. BUT they changed the product. I contacted the company about the fact that the sticky substance does not extend to the end of the pad anymore. They told me that I just had some defective product. BUT now I looked at the new packaging and they are just like the ones that were defective. Are they trying to save money?? by not extending the sticky part to the end of the pad. The pad now curls up at the front and back. NOT GOOD! I haven't found me a substitute, but am looking."
1,Why was it changed?,"I've used Poise Pantiliners for several years and found them quite adequate for light leakage. Unfortunately, they have been changed, coated with something that's supposed to make them more absorbant. Whatever this coating is, I am allergic to it and develop a painful rash when I use them. I've had to change products to something that does not work as well as the old Poise.I hope the manufacturer will get enough complaints to change back to the old formula!"
5,Truly excellent!!,"After seeing the movie, I got the soundtrack and fell in love with it even more than the film. The music is wonderful and has alot of different pieces that make up a solid whole. I have a good understanding of Argentine Tango history and have developed a passion for this music. I highly recommend it."
5,Imagining the Psalms,"A lovely edition of the Psalter, this is the text of the King James (Authorized) Version, with illuminated, ornate capitals for every psalm from medieval manuscripts, as well as some full-page illustrations, also from the same period. Until opening my copy of this book, I had not read KJV for many years; something about this combination of text and imagery adorns and beautifies the old language. A wonderful gift."
2,"Overwrought, overrated..","Jay Bennett worked with Wilco starting with their first masterpiece, Being There, and given that I was excited to hear what he would come up with on his own. Turns out, not much. Most of the songs are typical Beatles-inspired jangle and quite tuneful, but are bogged down by long-winded arrangements. These could be great pop songs, but Bennett and Burch seem to think that they should go on forever. It's also disappointing to hear such a poorly produced album, given Bennett's credentials as a ""Noted"" producer. Don't worry Wilco fans, Bennett's input and influence was overstated. Jeff Tweedy is the real deal."
3,"Please, No Part 2","I have to take exception with the reviews under mine. This CD, while somewhat entertaining, never reaches anywhere close to Wilco's recordings. It is clear that Jeff Tweedy brought originality to Wilco, not Jay Bennett. The Palace at 4 am seems to me like Bennett sitting at home wishing he could one-up Wilco by thinking he was Elvis Costello. (Bennett even attempts to re-record Wilco's song ""MyDarlin"" resulting in a song identical in form but nowhere as good as Wilco's) Seriously, the Costello influence is evident on every song even going as far as borrowing the hi-hat bit from ""New Lace Sleeves"" !! Bennett's voice is pretty bad and his music is blah blah pop with nothing special."
4,One of the best songs I've ever heard,"Love the album... All I'm going to say is that track 2, ""Talk To Me,"" is one of the finest songs I have heard in a long, long time. It is amazing."
2,A Letdown - or Unfairly the Victim of High Expectations?,I have great respect for Jay Bennett having seen Wilco many times and knowing his huge influence on the very positive direction the Wilco sound has grown. But this record really falls flat for me. I have tried putting it aside for a week a couple of times in the hope that the light will turn on if I let it rest for a while but it hasn't grown on me. It's just too studied and precious. The melodies are a bit tired and do not deserve the self-reverent production and cloying vocals. Drinking on Your Dime particularly annoys. A kitchen-sink of shop-worn melodies cobbled together with an annoying retro-mellotron.
3,"Please, No Part 2","I have to take exception with the reviews under mine. This CD, while somewhat entertaining, never reaches anywhere close to Wilco's recordings.

Seriously, the Costello influence is evident on every song even going as far as borrowing the cymbal bit from ""New Lace Sleeves"" !! Bennett's voice is pretty bad and his music is blah blah pop with nothing special."
4,Clarifying raven2017,"I could not submit a review without giving it a rating, so I randomly went with 4 stars.Jay Bennett did not simply ""have a hand"" in writing ""My Darlin'.'' Rather he WROTE the song. Our version (the one which appears on P4AM) is the original, and Summerteeth's is the cover, in spite of their flip-flopped order of release.As for ""Shakin' Sugar"" and ""Venus,"" we have always been very clear right from the start that these songs were Tweedy/Bennett collaborations (""check your fileshares"" suggests cloak-and-dagger antics). If ""Sugar"" sounds like Wilco's ""Alone,"" it shouldn't be surprising because the basic tracks are the same. WHY are they the same? Because Jay Bennett played EVERY instrument on the Wilco version. We simply added some more stuff to it and put it on our record.As to whether people like our record better or Wilco's records better, I do not really care. I make records because I enjoy it. I just wanted to clarify a mis-informed opinion.Thanks,Edward Burch"
4,This isn't Wilco...but that's good!,"I suppose it's natural for the breakup of a band (or one musician's removal as was the case with Jay Bennett being forced to leave Wilco) to cause fans to take sides and proclaim one side the victor. This happened when Uncle Tupelo broke up and people took sides either with Jay Farrar or Jeff Tweedy. Personally, I couldn't care. They are both stellar musicians and I've enjoyed their respective work over the past several years.This album by Jay Bennett is surprisingly good and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Son Volt/Jay Farrar, Wilco, Ryan Adams, or any other singer-songwriter who sings with passion. No, it's not Wilco, but for that I'm thankful. If he had left the band and tried only to repeat what Wilco was doing, he would be bashed left and right. Give the man some props for doing his own thing and enjoy it for what it is...Great music."
4,Drinking On Your Dime,"I purchased this disc mainly for the song ""Drinking On Your Dime"" which i heard in a movie which I do not recall the name of. Great melodies are all through the songs and was so happy that this did not turn out to be one of those cd's you buy for one song and it turns out that nothing else is worth listening too. The song mentioned however is worth the price of the disc, great tune."
2,"emphasis on ""party""","24 Hour Party People is basically about one man (a news reporter) who walks around Manchester England and explains the significance of the punk movement from the 70's with such groundbreaking artists as the Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order and several others. The problem is that everything is a big party scene and nothing else.You have a man cheating on his wife, the wife cheating on him, back alley parties in vans, admiring and getting inside scoops on certain bands, getting a general idea what the people around Manchester are like, and that about covers it.Unfortunately nothing ever particularly compelling or memorable occurs so a film like this is probably only worthwhile to those who are *heavily* interested in the early days of the punk movement. If you're expecting a satisfying drama or comedy, you might wanna look elsewhere. Only the short concert footage snippets are worth your time. Avoid."
3,Love It!,"The history of Factory Records and Hacienda in Manchester, UK, told through the life of TV Personality and music afficianado Tony Wilson from 1976-94. Very likable film, with due respect paid to the giants of the scene: Joy Division (especially Ian Cutis), New Order, and The Happy Mondays. The music running through the film is, of course, spectacular, and for those of us who missed the early days, the recreation of the club and concerts was spectacular."
3,"Good, But Not Great","I was actually pretty disappointed in this movie. I expected it to be more vibrant and exciting, but it just wasn't. The music is great, obviously, but it just isn't enough to make this movie excellant. It could have been lots better.Steve Coogan is better than the movie. His character(Tony Wilson) isn't all that interesting or likable, but Coogan does what he can with the role. The other actors are reasonably good too, so the movie isn't unbearable.There are brief flashes of genius in this movie and they should not be forgotten. This movie is very different and may appeal some viewers more than others. Those with an open and receptive mind will probably like at least some parts of this movie, however, people who are used to more Amercanised movie-making may not get this movie at all and hate it."
4,An excellent art-house film,"This is a fantastic film by British director Michael Winterbottom which explores the history of England's post-punk Factory Records through the hilarious perspective of its founder Tony Wilson. True, your enjoyment of the film will be greatly enhanced if you are/were a fan of Joy Division (the band that became New Order) or the Happy Mondays (the band that seemed to accidentally invent techno and the rave generation), but even for the unannointed, the film is painfully (and humorously) honest, filled with self-depricating wit, and a must-see for those eager to explore low-budget, Dogme 95-esque video-filmmaking. Winterbottom may not be as devoted to the craft and cinematic grammar of directing as he is to capturing the tone and emotion of the story, but this lopsidedness actually seems to enhance the film, which feels as if it was made during the anything-goes moment of post-punk and MTV."
2,"Enjoyed the music, but hated the movie.","After hearing such positive buzz about ""24 Hour Party People"" I decided to give the film a chance without knowing anything about it. Let me just tell you, I was bored to tears. I like 80s music, I grew up in the 80s so obviusly I love it, but this is a horrible film, and it's only redeaming quality is the good music, which by the way is shown only in very breif segements. Anyone that likes structure or a real story please avoid this film at all costs."
4,Good if you are familiar with the music.,"This film is very good if you are into Factory as a whole. If you are watching it just for one band, don't. You will find yourself disappointed."
2,Snore.,"Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like ""Groove"", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many."
5,"greatvl movie, smooth transaction",Great movie chronicaling the exciting life of Tony Wilson and Joy Division/New Order and The Happy Mondays Factory Records operation.
3,Great Movie; Make sure your version works in USA,Great movie but not for everyone.Make sure you get the version that works in USA.Mine did not and had to be returned.
1,Too liberal. Environmental-wacko,Would have loved it without the stupid environmental wacko crap. Very disappointed that the storyline was so bad. Will not recommended it to anyone.
4,Honeymoons can be fun & still have love,The dvd was very entertaining. The scenery was very nice but still authenic.The couple cared about each other and worked together.The mystery element kept your attention.
3,The Price & Me: A Royal Honeymoon,I did not get to watch this movie because I did not know there was a Experation date on it.
2,Missed the mark,"I am very glad to see clean, family friendly movies being made. This movie fits that description. Unfortunately, it was so boring and/or cheesy, that no one in my family wanted to see it. The story line was OK, but predictable; the villains were melodramatically over-villainous; the couple kissed or held hands every time they got together to remind us this was a fairy-tale romance; and some of the scenery was obviously low budget. There were parts that were definitely good, but they were overshadowed by the overall feel of the movie. It could have been quite a bit better."
4,Like the movie.,I thought this movie was pretty good! I just had one problem i could not play the DVD in my DVD Player. I ended up playing it in my computer. I wish i know how to fix that any Ideas?
2,Captain Vic,"Dissapointing, I loved the first with Julia Styles and Luke Mably but, none of the lead actors in this movie seem to be fitting into their characters. Zorin for one does not do, this actor has no idea where he fits in the picture, not even talking about Scott. If a series such as this is planned by the producers they should make sure that all the lead actors are available throughout to ensure proper continuity. Kam Heskin and Chris Geere does just not cut it. There seem to be a certain rythm in their playing the characters of Paige and Eddie that is absent. The acting of all the characters is very amateuristic and does not comply with the rythm and flow of the Prince and Me. If you have not seen the first Prince and Me maybe this one could go down as a good stand alone but, if you want it on your shelve for future viewing I would not recommend buying it. Sorry guys you just did not get it right a third time, Please don't try again. All but a romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned."
2,Series is getting Tired,"Unfortunately these days the First of series like Prince and Me was by far the best. The Second not as good but OK, the third nope.Itreally does not make sense and looked like it was thrown together and once again a new Female lead.Time to stop guys ."
2,A gift!,"I purchased this dvd for my Mother. I really didn't like it much at all, but she enjoyed it. The first one of the set (Prince & Me), was the only one that I thought was half way any good. My Mother enhjoyed them very much."
3,24 Bit Remaster?,"I remember the songs from the 80's, I remember the sound-quality and I was very excited to catch the remasters.It was a big surprise to me listening these pretty songs:only the cymbals sounds crispy,but no dynamics,no soundstage,only merging instruments.It could heve been a better master job in 2002:listen to it on portable cd-players or mini Hifi, use bass controls or loudness:otherwise its a shame on quality or high-end equipments.The music is great!A music fan from Budapest"
2,Oopps,"I was making a purchase of ONLY one song (Call me) and I guess I purchased the whole greatest hits, that's not what I intended to do, I guess I'll pay closer attention next time."
3,Pretty good music...,"I'm not a big fan of this type of music, but I must say that this album was not bad at all. I would suggest this cd if you are a fan of late 70's early 80's pop music."
5,Blondie,"If your a fan of Blondie don't pass this up, it's her greatest hits, keep in mind Blondie was around way before Madonna and Lady GaGa and I have been her fan for years."
5,Opalescent,"Extensive hits compilation of this group that made amazing songs in the most different kinds of style. Each one of their songs is pure pleasure. My favorite songs actually are all of them together, but especially Dreaming"", The Tide Is High"", Hanging On The Telephone"", Rapture"", Picture This"", Union City Blue"" and Island Of Lost Souls"". Very recommendable is also the corresponding live album Blondie Live""."
1,blondie review,Extremely disappointed! I bought this cd because I like Blondie and the cd was described as re-mastered. sound was not good. Dont buy this cd if you want quality . Wish I could return it.
4,Blondie's hits,"I really didn't get into Blondie when I was younger, but now that I'm older I can appreciate them. More than a few good songs."
5,Once I had a love and it still kick some ass' !,"It's counting 2002 and Blondie is still counting their hits!19 incredible Blondie hits over the past 25 years. Their latest UK #1 ""Maria"" is included on this compilation! Besides the US toppers like ""Call me"",""The Tide Is High"", ""Rapture"" and ""Heart of Glass"" this CD contains 15 other worldwide Blondie toppers, all re-mastered!Lay your hands on this brandnew Greatest Hits compilation, you won't regret it!! For the new ""Blondie lovers"": this CD will introduce you to the next Blondie studio album, to be released early next year !"
4,Slim Thugga the Boss,"If you Tru and down with Slim Thug, you'll love this mix. The audio is a little weak and distorted, true underground, but songs I can't get anywhere else. From SUC and Lil Flip dissin' to Boyz N Blue reppin', this mixtape if a must for Texans and fans of Texas rap."
1,Wiccan does hoodoo,"I bought this book, read this book, and returned this book.....It seems the author has a written some account of watered down hoodoo from a seemingly wiccan perspective. I couldnt take this author seriously for a minute. If its a hoodoo book you want, read Yronwode's book and take her class, its far better than this load of nonsense!"
1,no no no no no,"I agree whole heartedly with the last reviewer that wrote in about this author taking her work from the emperor of fluff himself, scott cunningham. This is NOT NOT NOT hoodoo. Her second book which Ive also reviewed is slightly better information wise if you are not looking for hoodoo specific materiel but this book is an all out tragedy. I think the nest advice I would offer is to stay away from any hoodoo book that Llewyllyn has published, if you want new age wiccan fluff, Llewyllyn is your publishing house, if you want hoodoo specific materiel then like other reviewers have said read Hyatt and Yronwode, and I would also add Zora Hurston."
3,not good for beginners. look somewhere else,"I bought this book, since i'm just now getting into hoodoo. Though i'm sadden by this. yes it does have decent information and the receipes are nice,but there are many things missing. Some things she explains why but others she doesn't. I still find her a good writer, but i will look somewhere else for more of a beginner book. i think maybe this one is more for someone who's already been reading and practicing for a while and has a deeper understanding on hoodoo. as I do not. Still a good read."
2,not root,"This book is not really root as practiced in the south. Dont get me wrong, there are some things presented here but this is really more of the authors perspective on rootwork. Its not the worst available on the market but it is deffinently new age and toned down from true root. There are many out there who will tell you that root is not uniform and that completely true, its hardly uniform anywhere, there are differences and sometimes complete opposites in how root is done. The differences are not really my issue with this book. The main reason Im not a fan of this book is the seemingly softening and watering down of hoodoo given here. Its almost as if the author is caught between wanting to write about root and writing about a new age version of root."
4,The power of Hoodoo,"""Sticks, Stones, Roots, and Bones"" is a fabulous insight into the workings of the magick of Hoodoo. This book guides you through the elements of War, Love, Fertility, and Prosperity as seen by the hoodooist, and offers practical information on making your own mojo's and washes.Hoodoo, not to be confused with Vodou (also spelled Voodoo and Vodoun) is a system of magick that was birthed out of folk magick practices, especially from those of the slaves brought from Africa, but became a collection of various folk magick practices and rootwork.I recommend this book for anyone who wishes to look into African American spirituality, Santeria, or Vodou. Just remember that she (the author) is only one opinion, and that there are various other books out there as well."
5,"Happy, informative book",This book was a pleasure to read. It's written in a style that you can't help but admire the writer and and feel that they wholheartedly believe in their subject and want to help you understand it too. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a better undersanding of HooDoo. It's not the usual airy-fairy crap that fills the shelves.
1,Nonsense,"I have to agree with those who wrote in saying that this is a work of nonsense. It is typical that Llywellyn would publish a book like this, and it smacks of the ""fluffy bunny"" style of most every other Llywellyn book. In keeping with the same tradition of Ray Malbrough's epic failure, ""Hoodoo Mysteries"" this book by Bird is just another waste of paper. If you are looking for books on the subject of Hoodoo and Rootwork, read Cat Yronwode's excellent book, Jim Haskin's work, and the Hyatt materials."
3,Need a different Publisher,"The book started out wonderful. Bird is a fantastic writer with a lot to offer. The problem I had with it was after the first few chapters it took a nose dive into the typical Llewellyn cutsie style. It is easy to tell the author was bound to a certian ""formula"" for the publisher.If she publishes another book at a different publishing house I would get it. If you love Llewellyn's stuff this is the book for you. If you want history, folklore and a real sense of the work only the first few chapters are for you. I do commend her on sourcing the organizations trying to save the Gullah/Geechie way of life. I just wish she had been free to continue her style through the whole book. To tell the truth it would be impossible to take a formula from the end of this book and tell it apart from any other author in the stable.I wish Bird the best of luck in this effort and hope she finds another publisher very soon so she is free to teach what she obviously knows."
1,Are these author's books for kids?,"I have read two books by Jean Plaidy, including this one and I find her dialog and general writing style for simpletons or for kids. It was very frustrating and highly disapointing."
5,VERY FUNNY,I LOVED watching the Flintstones and the Jetsons growing up and I think this is a GREAT movie that should show up on TV sometime (maybe Cartoon Network) :)
5,great kids movie,i really got the movie for my self more then the kids i love the flintstones and im collecting them
5,Jetson/Flintstones,"I was so excited to see this video! When my children where small I bought this movie from Avon and they watched it everyday 2 or 3 times a day to the point I could quote what was going to be said next...My children are grown with family's of there own, I bought this tape to surprise them when they bring their children over we can all set down and watch it. The grand kids love it, yet another generation of ""The Jetsons meet the Flintstones"" fans. Absolutely love this movie all over again."
5,"The Greatest Coming Together in the History or ""Prehistory"" of Family","Hanna-Barbera brought together their legendary families, the prehistoric family, the Flintstones and the futuristic family, the Jetsons in the full length feature ""The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones"" Elroy invents a time machine that sends his family to a Million years back in time to Bedrock, Home of Fred and Wilma Flintstone and Barney and Betty Rubble. Fred & Barney show George their prehistoric city, Wilma and Betty show Jane cooking brontosarus meat, Judy is out to hook up with a prehistoric boy and Astro has found Dino to chase. The time Machine accidently sends the opposite family to the opposite time, so until everyone gets back to the right time, the Jetsons experience ancient relics while the Flintstones experience advanced technology. It's delightful and fun coming together of Two legendary families from Hanna Barbera."
5,This is the best kids movie!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best kids movie. If you like the Flintstones and the Jetsons this is the best movie. The two famlies meet and they switch places. Buy this movie or else!!!
5,BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,this is a great show eney one how wants to help will love this show. this is the BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!
3,The magic,"I LOVE LOVE the show Extreme makeover home ed. I was a bit disappointed by the dvd. The episodes in it didn't convey the warmth or the heart that I usually feel when I watch the show. I was also sad that it didn't include one of my favorite episodes. The one where Lee Ann Womack sings ""I Hope You Dance."" I hope that the season 2 dvd is better."
3,scholarly graffiti,"This might be one of the only few written things out there trying to bring graffiti as a concept into the scholarly/ academic envrionment. I don't know that they proved anything, but it was a decent attempt. If you are looking for graff books with lots of color pictures, don't buy this book."
2,Another book about the same graffiti writers as in every other book,"Here again is another book I found repetitive, using the same few graffiti artist.Nothing new about this book either. Nice color photos, same O graffiti writers.I found this book boring.Nice cover, and color photos."
3,Good,"We got this for our 3-month-old boy. Very nice looking, easy to assemble, compact and easy to move around. However, when he starts kicking his legs, the anemic battery-operated motor stalls and stops. No A/C power supply adoptor."
4,great for our baby,"Our baby has reflux and colic...she hates the boppy swing we got her, but likes this glider, it just goes back and forth instead of in an arc (like the swing does) so I think she feels more secure in it, sometimes even falls asleep in it. We've really liked it. The mobile moves around (battery operated) also. We paid less than this for it though...around $50"
1,A huge disappointment...,"I was actually quite disappointed in this book, as I'm looking to get into doing my own juicing. But there were so few fruit/vegetable combinations (which is what I am looking for) and so many hard-to-find or expensive ingredients, that it really just was not helpful to me at all"
4,Pretty Good Starter,"This book is definately not 10 point material, but is nothing to sneeze at, never-the-less. Each chapter of the book was short, and simple, and you were expected to learn ""why"" something worked instead of just ""type this blindly"" (the teach yourself in XX days books use that method and I find it hard to LEARN anything from them) I really enjoyed the book and retained a lot of the information too! The biggest turnoff today for the book is that it covers jdk1.0.x thus some of the APIs are deprecated (this can be a good thing though, it will teach you how to use the API manuals to find out what replaced those deprecated APIs.. thus LEARNING) I too noticed many typos, but to look at the bright side, when I saw a typo it proved to me that I was actually LEARNING, and was able to point out errors made by the author themself.. in short, even the books shortcomings turned out to be vastly helpful!"
3,More Stand-Alone and Less General Programming,Ten-minute approach is good to teach the beginners new tricks. They may learn general data processing knowledge later on. It is more attractive with few simple lessons on Stand-Alone programms working with files. I wish to buy some copies of the next edition.
4,A good book if you want to learn Java Now!,"Java Now! is probably the quickest and most content-packedbook about the Java programming language.The book, which is divided into three sections, coversalmost all topics of Java programming from variables toloops to threads to animation to mouse and keyboard inputto interfaces and inheritance to abstract classes todialog-box operations and more.So, if you're a begginer and are looking for an easy way tolearn Java, this is the book for you. You can finish readingit quickly, due to its 10-minute lessons, and be on yourway to creating complex object-oriented programs withindays."
5,"This is the best book on ""Man-Made"" UFOs","Packed with illustrations, this is the best book on the unusual subject that many UFOs are part of a top-secret project that began during WWII. Vesco was an Italian aircraft engineer who knew what he was talking about. He claims that Foo Fighters were developed in Germany, as were ""discoid"" craft. These German scientists then were moved to New Mexico where they created the secret space program. This book will amaze the reader with many references and the history of Project Paperclip scientists and the genisis of ""flying saucers"" made on Earth by humans. I love this book!"
3,Hostage,"Decent price but the cost of shipping makes it almost prohibitive. It is so light and compact, it could have been put in a small envelope and sent for less than $1. Unfortunately there is no other source I could find."
4,do what they're supposed to,OEM pads fit well and do their job. can be cleaned with vinegar or even hot water and re-used once or twice.
3,a bit disappointing,Given the unique story lines which I like - the woman auto mechanic - this book should have been better. The character development was all to un-unique.
1,"Like new, great book on kyaking for women",This book is perfect for new kayakers. It has everything you need to know with good illustrations and kind advice and encouragement.
5,Excellent Resource,We're all out on the water. Excellent source of information with a target audience.
5,Head and shoulder above other books in this genre,"I've been reading a lot of books about love and relationships in connection with a book I'm working on, and this collections of essays was so superior to the others in the quality of the writing and the honesty and charm of the personal accounts (with a few notable exceptions, including Edward Hoagland's essay) that I made a special effort to post a comment here. This would be an excellent book to give a friend who has a perfectly wonderful marriage that he or she is thinking of walking out on, or to someone who's just experiencing a case of the marriage blahs."
2,Was my favorite until...,This game is great until you run into roster bugs. Make a change to your line-up and you run a 75% chance of losing a player and filling his spot with a duplicate of another. Very frustrating.
2,Cribbage for Experts,"I am a relative new beginner being taught by a 92-year old. It is so hard to remember all the rules but I am getting there. I thought this book would be more helpful but it sticks to one hand throughout much of the book. To be an expert I need more than different ways to score more than the same old hand. As I read the different ways to score, I was thinking I already learned that. Perhaps I am an expert already and don't know it. I did not learn anything new from this book."
3,good but beyond my attenton span,"It is really informational and worth having for those consumed by cribbage. It required too much attention for me to digest so I caution those who are not driven. Otherwise, an excellent product."
4,Very Wordy....,"The title says it all, ""For Experts"". If you just want to learn how to play, without all the technical terms, this book is not for you. There were 2 terms I was disappointed to have not seen. ""Skunk"" and ""A skunk is 2 wins"". I think every cribbage book should make that clear :)"
3,"Good When It Rocks, Bad When it Ballads","Def Leppard can still rock with the best bands, as their covers of Rock On, The Golden Age of Rock 'N Roll, and No Matter show. However, on the slower numbers Def simply can't cut it anymore; the vocals of Joe Elliot aren't nuanced enough to carry the load, and the slower songs end up sounding flat. All in all, this is an OK album, but not one that's going to stand the test of time. I'm already taking it out of my car's CD player in favor of something else."
2,Average Bar Band Material,"Def Leppard's original songs are already a much better tribute to these artists than this recording. They've already shown that they can masterfully blend all these influences into their own powerful sound. Most of the tracks here, even in their original state, are flat-out average. My brother in law's cover band does a version of ""No Matter What"", just as convincingly as it's covered here. To me, most of these selections just don't do anything to showcase Def Leppard's strengths. Where is the opportunity for ripping Vivian & Phil guitar solos? Where is Rick's great bass line in ""Rock On""? These are not Joe's lyrics and overall they lack his unique way of phrasing and singing them. I've listened to this disc over and over hunting for places where they shine. 20th Cen. Boy, Hell Raiser, Street Life and maybe He's Gonna Step are worth downloading. The rest should've landed on the editing room floor."
2,Half Empty,"I'll start by saying I am a fan of Def Leppard, but haven't much cared for them post-""Hysteria."" I wouldn't have even given this album a shot except for the fact there were so many good reviews. I hoped I'd be pleasantly surprised, but a cover of 70s glam by what is, theoretically at least, a metal band?Some of the track selections really intrigued me. For example, I really looked forward to a driving version of ""Rock On."" Unfortunately, what you get is a flat, anesthetized version of the song, sapped of all life. The band's attempts to cover Bowie and ELO also fall completely flat.Not all of the tracks are bad, ""Hangin' On the Telephone"" is a lot of fun, and ""No Matter What"" is a faithful, if uninventive cover. ""Waterloo Sunset"" is also an ok track.Overall I'd say pick and choose a few of the tunes you want and download them, but avoid the entire album. For me, this seems like yet another nail in DefLep's prematurely closed coffin. And that cover? Ugh...."
4,"Better than there last effort, X","Pretty good cd, best they've sounded so far in the 2000's. The real highlights are, Waterloo Sunset and A Little Bit of Love, it's worth the price of the cd just for those songs.Others that good are; No Matter What, Rock On, 20 Century Boy, and Hellraiser.I would have preferred some covers of songs that were more popular from the 70's, but it's their favorites from the past, not mine!"
5,Yeah! (2006),"For their follow up to 2005's ""Rock of Ages"" complation, Def Leppard decided to release a covers album ""Yeah"" to pay tribute to their influences. To the bands credit they stay away from most of the artists that they chose to covers biggest hits, when they could have easily choose songs that where better known. I only knew around four of the songs before I heard ""Yeah"". I find ""Yeah"" to be what a good covers album should be. The band turns to on to their influences and makes many of the songs into their own. Highlights include: No Matter What, 20th Century Boy, Hanging on the Telephone, and Hellraiser. Phil Collen's vocal on Stay with Me is awesome, it sounded so much like Rod Stewart. ""Yeah"" is a good album old and new fans of Def Leppard. There's a little something for everyone on ""Yeah""."
5,A Great Def Leppard CD,"If you grew up listening to Def Leppard or recetiently got into Def Leppard, an absolut must for all fans.All the songs are great."
5,Excellent Cd.:-),"SunnyMan, the next time instead writing you go to write book reviews for cacophonous music. Trash it you will be you.Slang was an optimal album, this is the demonstration that of music you do not understand nothing."
3,Covers collections: the new stopgap,"In the old days, when a band didn't quite know what to do next they'd quickly release either a live set or a best-of. Today you can add ""covers"" albums as a stall-for-time messure. We've already seen this from Guns n Pousers, Ramones, Slayer, Metallica, Ozzy (the less said of his the better!), Helloween and Rush (although their's was just an EP). Now from Leppard.Not that this is a bad album, mind you. Their takes of the Nerves/Blondie's ""hanging on the telephone"" and T Rex' ""20th Century boy"" are highlights. And hats off to them for putting a few forgotten hits back on the map- Sweet's ""hell raiser"". (They could have done withOUT the neo-techno version of David Essex' ""rock on"", though.) And this CD has the most enthusiasm they've had since the 80s. It's just too bad the didn't use this energy and enthusiam on new original material."
3,Good!,If you are a fan of Def Leppard you will enjoy this. If you grew up in the 70s you will like it even more with the old songs.
4,Excellent Release!,"This album is simply a wonderful surprise. A band that hit its heyday with Hysteria 9 years ago has done what few bands can do-record a very solid covers album.I read many reviews on Yeah! before I purchased it and those reviews were very much correct. The album is quite solid. Personally, I would have liked a couple more radio-known songs on it, but it is well worth the purchase.Having been an ELO fan since 1976, any band that can cover 10538 Overture and do just as good a job as Jeff Lynne and Co. is alright in my book! Now, if Def Lep would only cover The Move classic ""Do Ya""........"
5,Good CD,Def Leppard has always been a very good band with good music. This CD is no exception. All the songs are good. My 2 favorite songs are 20th Century Boy and Stay With Me which sounds just like the Faces version. Def Leppard always amazes me at what they can do.
5,If you wanna get rocked...,"then this is a great album to buy! Joe and the guys sound as good today as they did 20-some years ago and this cover album is a great example of that. Not only is the music great, but it's cool to see where the band came from -- who they were listening to (and probably still listen to) and who inspired them when they were getting started. Covers of Bowie, Rod Stewart and the Kinks (I think Waterloo Sunset is one of my favorite tracks) are attention-getting and very tastefully done. Another track in particular that stands out is Rock On. I was really surprised because I'd never cared much for that song, but Def's version thoroughly rocks -- especially live. They're on tour promoting YEAH! this summer and if you have the opportunity you should definitely catch them. The 4th of July show was perfectly spectacular."
2,Not Rockin,"Man, i was disappointed! Ive been a Lep fan for ages, i got all their cd's, and have to say this is their worst! This album should of been an addition to their new release! Then it would be okay, but for a new album? no way, this sucks, this aint def leppard."
2,is this the garbage that I have been waiting for ???,"What a huge disappointment, can't belive these are the same guyswho did HYSTERIA and PYROMANIA.YEAH!! Sucks more then SLANG!!!, I should have known that everyone can't be a U2 or a Depeche mode.I wish I could get my money back."
1,Big Business Ruins Everything,"I'm sure Def Leppard had to put out an album per their contract, so why not do an easy cover album? Hey, I know, if we want to save tons of money on licensing fees, we can pick mediocre songs that no one has ever heard of, and they will lap it up, like the slop it is. Come on, did anyone really like these songs the first time around? Why would they get better now? At least Rush did Crossroads. As bad as Rush's cover album was, this one is worse."
1,GRADE: F,"They should have done covers their entire career cause their own music is soooo bad. Well, so are these covers.. here exists a band that should have never gotten out of the gate. This is pathetic. Why was this released? Over-produced dreck and most likely a label requirement. Grade: F. F for ever existing. F for all the ""music"" they've insulted the public with. F for big hair and ripped jeans. F for their Behind The Music, as if anyone cares about this band, VH-1 broadcast. F for this release that should have been burried when this band was hatched decades ago. F.. F ... F.Terrible band."
3,The Leps give us a review of their soft-rocking influences,"Well, I guess I'd better preface this by saying I'm a fan of Def Leppard's more hard-rocking stuff like ""Pyromania"" and ""Retroactive"", and that's the crux of my mixed feelings about this album. It consists of their covers of 70's music that inspired them, and many of these covers are rather mediocre ones of rather mediocre 70's glam and pop-rockers - not bad, just nothing great. However, there are a number of great ones in here, too - particularly ""Don't Believe A Word"" (orig. by Thin Lizzy), ""10538 Overture"" (ELO), etc.. as well as some decent ones. Overall about a third pretty good, a third decent, and a third kind of boring."
5,Awesome!!,I am a Def Leppard fan from way back in the beginning so I always buy every CD that comes out and you will not be disappointed by this! I think it is their greatest CD yet! Most times I am disappointed when an artist covers someone else's music because it never sounds quite right - but the boys from Sheffield come through again! Even my 8 year old is in love with this CD!
4,It shouldn't be this good or fun - but it is,"No one would have expected a Def Leppard album in 2006 to be good enough to be on any list, let alone an album of covers by them, but here it is, 2006 and they've done a killer covers album - the best thing they've released in nearly 20 years. What makes it work best is that the covers are primarily songs that weren't hit singles, unlike most covers albums that rely on songs that everyone knows so well that instant comparisons are impossible to live down. Here, it's possible to just let the obvious fun the band had creating this album overtake you instead of mentally A/Bing theirs with the originals. Serious fun."
4,Similiar to Lord Of The Dance,Michael Flately is at his usual high level of entertaining for fans of Irish Dancing and Celtic Music. More of the same as far as type of music and costumers. Sets are an improvement from previous Flately productions. Love the music particularly.
5,un rock celtique superbe.,"J'adore la musique celtique et le rock, mais jusqu'à présent je ne trouvais pas de mélange des deux, qui soit harmonieux. Les sonorités étaient ou trop traditionnelles, ou trop rock. Là, c'est le top.A quand le prochain album ?"

1,Pain In The Butt!,"It's a pain in the butt to slip the thing on. It's great for when you're exercising, but it's just too much of a hassle to slip on and take off the device. The buttons aren't as easy to press either. It's better to have the Zune bare as it is."
2,E. Howard EH-23SA Stainless Steel Atomic Watch,"Nice watch, but HUGE. THe face is so large it looks like you're wearing a CLOCK on your wrist. Well made, nice features... but I returned it just due to the size of it."
2,Not Recomended,The watch stopped working after one year. I took it to a watch repair shop and they told me it was not worth fixing. Typical of Chinese made products.
2,Bad choice,The watch looks good but was not what I expected. The face is much too big and bulky looking and the watch strap is much too short for even a medium wrist. I had to pay shipping for receiving and shipping the product back. To this day I will only stick with Amazon directly sold products.
5,E Howard EH-23SA Watch,"This is my 2nd watch by E Howard. Problem with the last watch, failed to receive updates to time. Could not set manually."
1,This Watch is TechnoCrap,"What is TechnoCrap? It's technology that almost works, doesn't. Spread the word.I bought this watch and it ran fine for 8 months in Denver, near the WWVB transmitter in Ft. Collins. Then I went to California. When I attempted to set it to the new time zone, it went bonkers. It could not recieve WWVB, and the manual settings did not work. In fact, the watch did not work as the manual said it should. I thought I might replace the battery, but there is no way to get the back off. I'm an engineer,and this was very frustrating.I spent a week adding three hours and subtracting 22 minutes to figure out what time it was. As I was leaving to return to Denver, the crystal cracked. When I got home I threw it in the trash and ordered a LaCross WT-967, a model in a line of watches that I have used worldwide without difficulty for many years. Not quite as pretty, but they work."
4,"Seconds are dead on, check the minutes.","I love this watch but can only give it four stars. It receives the WWVB signal every two or three days in Maine, so the seconds are dead accurate, but it once lost seven minutes. I was able reset it and it has not gone off since. I find this extremely careful tracking of seconds along with careless loss of minutes somewhat endearing - it reminds me of some of my own misplaced priorities.The size and clarity of the display are also good for my tired aging eyes, like a kitchen clock with a strap. The watch it replaced had a plethora of little dials trying to tell me things I don't need to know and I had to find my best reading glasses and stare at it in good light just to tell the time.So this ""atomic"" watch is my favorite among a drawer full of time keepers, but I check the minutes every now and then."
3,I like this watch,"I like this watch. I had an earlier version and liked it well enough to purchase another. It is certainly good value. I appreciate the upgrade. It is easier to change time zones. It surprises me that atomic, aka radio-controlled watches are not more popular. It is nice to know that one has the accurate time."
2,It's not accurate and it has a wood case!,"Incredible. The watch is exactly one minute behind. A friend told me I was wrong when we compared time. I have an atomic clock and a comparison showed the watch is a minute behind. I checked on the Atom Time program on the computer and the watch is exactly a minute behind. To boot, the watch comes with a meaningless nice wood case to store it in. Why I would want to store a watch in a wood case instead of wearing it to tell time, the purpose for which I bought the watch, is beyond my understanding. And, if you are still thinking of buying the watch, the wrist band is just big enough to get around my wrist although I am medium build and only 5ft. 9in. At least the watch is consistent and so it is too big of a hassle to return the darn thing. Besides, hopefully it is one of a kind if the company quality control is any good - which is doubtful by my experience."
3,"great watch, failed to adjust this fall","really a great watch. I got it in June. I was disappointed when it failed to ""fall back"" this fall. I had to change the time zone to get the correct time. Then 3-4 days later, it did adjust, so I had to change the time zone again. Never did the antenna icon on the face disappear indicating loss of signal,,,so I don't don't what the problem was. Also, I downloaded the full manual from the website, but the manual was for a different watch."
3,Good dryer but annoying to use!!,"Just got two of these for our new house. Was sold by the retractable cord feature - which is fabulous! The real downside to these dryers is that there is no real 'on' button! You have to hold down a button on the dryer handle and keep it held down the entire time you are drying your hair! This is tough - especially for a lefty like me because the button doesn't sit in an ergonomic place for left handed people. If I had it to do over again, I'd deal with the twisting non-retractable cord and get one with a better on button. I know the older models were like that and I'd be inclined to check those out first."
5,J.T. Flynns Montana Mirage,"This is this a gripping story set in the aggressive beauty that is southwest Montana. A great read if you like a 'can't-put-em-down' mystery or if you want to know the difference between a coulee, swale, draw or drainage. Actually. . .that's STILL a mystery to me."
5,Paul's Best Live,"Hard to figure how this hasn't made it's way to DVD or better yet Blu-ray. A huge band of fantastic players easily handle the entire Paul Simon catalogue. The live version of ""Diamonds"" is worth the purchase price alone."
2,Where's the Bluray version???,"I rate this a 2 star, not because the video or concert is not good, but it's time to put this down to a Bluray version!! Concert in the Park is to me one of the best Paul Simon live performance. So come on, get the Bluray version out soon."
1,Very Poor Blower,Carry a back pack full of spare batteries if you use this for more than a minute. It starts off with a moderate air flow but almost immediately starts to wane. Very poor product.
3,"As A ""Graphic Novel"" Of A Classic Book It Falls Short","This 2007 release from Harper Collins was clearly an attempt to cash in on the ""graphic novel"" craze (that still goes on) by having Franois Rivière adapt, in French (this English edition is edited by Steve Gove) one of Christie's best Hercule Poirot stories to the format. But with a meagre 46 pages illustrated by Marc Piskic (very well done I might add) the story itself comes across as muddled and disjointed, especially if you are familiar with the original 1923 book. A curiosity at best for the art work."
5,a must-read for all treasure seekers,"This book exceeds all others on the background of the Spider Rock. Steve is able to draw you into the stories of the Spider Rock. If you're interested in diving deeper into the mystery and history of Spanish gold, look no further than this book. I found it to be a thorough guide to the treasure - complete with maps, photographs and clues into the secrets behind Spider Rock. Enjoy, truly a fascinating read."
3,Interesting set of mysteries need more investigation,I was intrigued by the supposed treasure maps and all the people who had been involved in looking for this treasure. A follow-up study involving professional archeologists might shed more light on the true meaning and sources of these maps.
4,good item,I was looking for a liitle theater for my sons to play with. the theater it self is fantastic. the fingerpuppets are terrible they don't stay on the finger and if you get them on it takes forever. Otherwise I love this protect. we had other habdpuppets and the boys love putting on shows
5,Dare I say I Liked It?,"I had never even heard of The Belle of 14th Street and found its concept pretty interesting. I find vaudeville very curious and I celebrate that Barbra tried this concept out. I suspect that vaudeville didn't have a great reputation and that it bombed because of that, but if you see talent involved and how good they are, that counts for a lot. I recommend it."
2,not enough Barbra,"I think that, when people see there's going to be a Barbra show, they expect to see and hear a LOT of Barbra. That's why I believe that this show is so disappointing in the first place. Since she was a pioneer of the type of TV musical special in which only the star performs (as opposed to the star and ""a whole host of musical guests,"") that's what we were looking for. This was such a departure from that format that it was a bit jarring.In the second place, it might have been saved had the entertainment been more ... entertaining. The music wasn't great, the comedy wasn't very funny, the drama wasn't poignant. Although the show might have been a faithful recreation of a real vaudeville show, I think it served more as an example of why vaudeville died."
1,JUST PLAIN AWFUL,"WHY BABS WOULD RELEASE THIS AS A SINGLE SINCE IT WAS IN HER RECENT BOX SET IS A SURPRISE BECAUSE ITS A GIGANTIC FLOP DESTINED TO THE .99 CENT BOX IN THE SUPERMARKET.IT REALLY IS DREADFUL UNLESS YOUR AN IDIOT WITH BAD TASTE.INSTEAD, GET MY NAME IS BABS, COLOR ME BABS, AND BABS IN CENTRAL PARK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED NON-STOP BY AN ORIGINAL AMERICAN GENIUS."
5,A Flintstone Christmas Collection,A movie for the family. Everyone of all ages can watch this. I LOVE the Flintstones especially the Christmas collection. Fred seems to mellow out and enjoys helping out Santa.
4,You get what you pay for.,"i bought this DVD for 4.99 and i was excited to get it. I grew up with this movie, so i was excited to learn i can get the DVD version for only 5 bucks. I received the right away but when i opened it up to watch it i saw something that concerned me. It looks like a burned CD, but come to my surprise it looks pretty decent. I would of given 5 stars, but the movie came in full screen and i have a wide screen TV which means it was cut off to only be in the center of the screen. I guess that's not the sellers fault I should of read the product description better."
5,My son loves it!,Thanks for the rapid response. My son got to enjoy over two weeks of anticipatory delight seeing his gifts wrapped under the tree and then the unparalled joy of actually enjoying it on Christmas and every day thereafter. Thank you!
5,Christmas Gift,I got this for my Uncle for Christmas last year and it was such a great idea for him Thank You!!!
2,So small it's a waste of money,"I was really let down by this product. My two year old uses it as a sitting bench...yes, it's that small! When she does try to play it she has to sit on her knees and crouch down. It is otherwise really well made and has surprisingly good sound...if it were double the size I would love it...as it is, it simply sits in the corner of the room unused."
3,Title not reflective of content,"The book had interesting tid-bits about Martina's emotional struggle to win in tennis and some details about her personal life. The reader is taken chronologically through her life from her defection to the US, to her rise on the circuit, and then her slow decline into history. The book was average, a little dry and boring at times. The author did a poor job at capturing and projecting Martina's greatness as a woman first and foremost and also as a tennis player."
5,Informatively covers inventions of everyday things,"Edward Tenne's Our Own Devicesr is superbly presented survey which is hard to easily categorize but nonetheless very highly recommended reading. Our Own Devices informatively covers inventions of everyday things that protect us, enhance performance, and help position us. From ergomatic chairs and recliners which moved from health resources to symbols of obesity to a keyboard which failed because professional pianists believed difficult passages needed to stay challenging, Our Own Devices draws some interesting parallels between advancements, achievement, and self-preservation."
3,Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest,"Episode 3(30 minutes long) of the Awesome Science DVD series will take your children on a visit to Arizona to check out the Petrified Forest and the Meteor Crater. As in the previous videos Noah explains the conflict between an old Earth and young Earth philosophy. He uses evidence from the Petrified Forest to support a young Earth view of creation and a world-wide flood. The video is a collection of footage, photos and art work with Noah speaking to you about what you are viewing.I think this video would make a good overview of the Meteor Crater and Petrified Forest before a visit or just to learn how they fit into a Biblical worldview. My children enjoyed watching it and learned more about the flood and creation.I received a free copy of this DVD from Master Books in order to write this review and have shared my honest opinion."
5,Love it...even tho my tissue roll keeps falling off,"I love it.. it was just what I was looking for, great weight too. I have 2 of them.. the fact that it can hold about 4 extra rolls of double tissue is great.. but you can't pull to hard.. every time I use it.. I snatch the entire roll off the holder."
3,Eh...it is okay,"I like the look of the holder and I like the storage of extra rolls. However, every single time you go to use the toilet paper it comes off the holder. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This is completely annoying so I end up just sitting the roll on the edge of the sink because I got tired of the roll flying off the this holder every time I pulled the paper. Had potential but just needs a redesign to keep the roll on the holder."
2,nice looking but did not last long,have had this about 7 months and the arm loosened up quickly (after just 2 months or so) causing the toilet paper to fall off and finally the arm snapped off and now it is just a toilet paper reserve. disappointing.
2,Don't bother,"Don't bother getting this video. It only shows you how to blow on a call. If you're a little kid this might be helpful. There is no information about setup location, wind direction, approaching your setup location, the general behavior of predators, when the best times are to call or the mating seasons. It's not even worth the 3 bucks I paid for it. It is just a big advertisement for Mr. Sceery to sell his hand held predator calls. I'm a professional predator hunter and this video is worthless."
3,City girl meets Montana cowboy,"Casey Marshall inherits a ranch. Before her physician-husband Dane Marshall was killed, he lent sixty thousand dollars to Ross Dalton to cover gambling debts when they happened to meet in Las Vegas. The collateral was one half of the Dalton family ranch in Montana....The local characters and townsfolk all add to the atmosphere of a closely knit community who really care about each other.This is Nichols' first effort. Well written with some interesting twists. I'm waiting to read more from her!"
3,Solid Roundup of House & Classic House Tracks,Nice but short CD of House & Classic House tracks. Nothing particularly outstanding or great - just a solid collection but no reason to pay more than list for tracks you could find almost of the same quality in any other house collection or any other BARGROOVES CD still in print.
1,Extremely Confusing For First Time Users,This book had me confused by the third page- it is definetely not a book that I would recommend to anybody with no knowledge of HTML to begin with.
5,Hope Samantha is releasing an album!,You are so right A Music Fan from USA. I love to listen to Christina Milian too. I hope both of them come out with a new album soon. Does anyone know if Samantha is coming out with a new album?
4,Not Bad!,"well i bought this single coz i like samantha,shes different.i think.tho her voice isnt that great compare to other singer.i bought the single becoz of the new version of 'im right here' feat damien marley.its rhytamic.wishing on star is slow number.kinda ok.but i think samantha need to come out with better uptodate songs for her new album.maybe add some rock..R&B rock?haha i dunno.hope she come out with a new album soon."
5,incredible!!!!,"for their sixth album, gentle giant left behind the moodiness of in a glass house and rocked this thing out. as strange as the songs are at times, they have such inertia that i recommend this (or free hand) as a good starting place to those who have not yet lived life to the fullest and consumed this wonderful band. fans of yes, genesis, ELP or king crimson should understand this complex universe spun by the mighty gentle giant."
3,Almost amazing,"Some amazing compositional stuff on here, but the whole thing feels too exercised for much to penetrate. GG were true progressive rock stars, challenging conventional time signatures and chord progressions in their sleep, and when trying, really reinventing what a traditional rock outfit can accomplish. The verses in So Sincere remind me of those incredibly eccentric melodic peaks the band seemed to articulate so fluidly, but despite a wealth of inventive spark throughout the relatively brief album, a whole does not outweigh these parts."
4,This watch met my expectaions.,"I like the style and accuracy of this watch. Everything is as advertised. It picked up the time signal quickly and has kept the time since then precisely. One minor ""complaint"": The thick leather band is a little hard to put on. It may break in and become more comfortable with continued wear."
3,Accurate but large,"This watch is as advertised, accurate. Very accurate. It looks good, but I was surprised by the unusually large face, which I don't remember described in the advertisement. It's really too large for my smallish wrist. Those with large wrists may find it more suitable. Handsome otherwise."
5,Finally replaced battery,Love this watch. Very care free (once its set) The battery ran out though and was a bit tricky to replace. The back does come off but its tough. There are no notches. I used a really sharp pocket knife to wedge in between the back bezel edge and used the lugs (things that holds the watch band) as leverage. After a bit of finesse and force was able to pop it off and get to the battery. It took a while to figure out as I was afraid to scratch it but figured it must come off some how and if I break it oh well.. it was useless to me with a dead battery anyways.. went for broke and it popped off nicely. Also bought a new watch band to boot :)
2,Extremely...,"Extremely accurate. After only 4 months, this watch became, with in a micro second, EXACTLY two hours off.... I'd give it one star except for the fact that is comes with the best, most comfortable band I have ever worn."
2,Cheap Watch,"Received the watch with it set to NY time. Difficulty resetting to MT Standard time. REsolved, attempted to synch with GMT, , the hands are off by 2 minutes and the seconds are exact. Cannot modify that feature. Watch is Thick and bulky, avoid the purchase. Deceiving,actually made in in CHINA, plastic watch."
2,Howard Watch battery,"I got this watch for my husband's birthday several years ago. He has wanted one for a while because he struggles with bad eyesight and resetting his other watches when the time changes in the spring and fall. This seemed to be the perfect choice. However, now that one of the 2 batteries (one for time one for date) has died and we need to replace battery, no one will work on it. I thought the price was great for a watch that doesnt need to be reset and that nice face on it. But if it was to be a disposable watch, I am not so happy about this item. Still trying to replace the batteries..."
4,watch,I just wanted to say that the watch was purchased as a gift and that the party getting it was completely satisfied with it.
1,This is a piece of crap. It does not work.,"This watch is a piece of crap. It took forever to receive the signal. Then still does not display the correct time. It is difficult to set. Anyone who says this thing is working is probably being paid to do so by the atomic watch people. I tried one of these several years ago, and that one did not work either. Never Again. This company is a fricking joke."
5,"Savory, but for special tastes","Proof positive there's life after Janis. This Big Brother collection of psychedelia-blues is by no means boilerplate. Produced by Nick Gravenites, Be a Brother is an eclectic roundup of tracks showcasing Gravenites and Sam Andrews' versatility.""Heartache People,"" a mesmerizing blues tune, highlights the album with a simple chord progression, a soothing electric violin and Nick vowing to stay away from anyone who will drag his spirits down. ""I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle,"" a country-dope ditty, could easily fit on a New Riders or Commander Cody LP. And for those who really miss JJ, there's ""Mr. Natural."" That's Janis making a cameo appearance with her trademark wail toward the very end of the song.The album is definitely a 4-star piece of work. The other star is for the album cover. Somehow, that hastily drawn gap-toothed fellow flashing the peace sign makes me smile."
5,Great idea,"I rented this book for a class I ended up dropping but the book was brand new when they rented it to me, and for only $25, great idea to do."
3,Like a Drunk in a Bar,"Parts of this book are very good, particularly when he analyzes the game in the manner of Bill James. However, he includes one, very long and very uninteresting chapter called ""Don't Blame the Yankees."" In it, he is completely out of control, like a drunk in a bar. Sure, his editor should have killed the chapter but Barra has to take the blame for ruining what could have been a pretty good book."
5,loved this workout,"I have several Firm, Jillian and Jackie Warner videos and rotate between them. I'm 46 and workout 6 times a week, so I'd say I'm intermediate to advanced. I ordered this from a recommendation of one of hte 10 best workout dvd's and wow, I agree! I found different exercises in here than I had ever seen/done before and I can tell it really worked my body, especially my legs. Although it could be done in individual 10 minute segments, I did all segments together and almost couldn't get through. There's a quick warmup in each, but not so slow that you really lose momentum between the sections. Some of the boot camp references were a little corny and her cueing isn't perfect - but once I've done it a few times I'm sure it will be no problem to follow along. The exercises changes enough to keep you from being bored but not so much that you can never catch up. I can't wait to get more of her tapes!"
5,Awesome Workout!!,This is the most intense 10 Minute Solutions workout I've tried. Jessica Smith is a great instructor and she tries to keep you motivated and focused during the workout. You will definitely work up a sweat! Highly recommend this one!
3,it's huge,"it's half again as large as my last temp. fork. and it takes 10-15 seconds to get the reading. my last fork took about 3. but it broke and they don't make it anymore. i had to learn that when the temp bar reached the very first bar for med-rare, that's when i needed to remove the meat. anything more and it was too done. but i guess every fork has it's learning curve. so far, i like it!"
5,Design is a masterpiece,"Design is hands down my favorite Gentle Giant song...and I have all the albums. Yes, it's as weird as it gets, but that's why I like GG...their weird."
4,"Uneven, disjointed, and catchy at the same time!","After the exceptional ""Free Hand"", Gentle Giant created their 4th concept album, (Three Friends, In a Glass House, and The Power and the Glory were the others)which didn't live up to the excellence of previous albums. Still, there are some great songs on here!"
3,I Can't Do What It,"I want to give this album a five for the music, but the remastering job was botched. It is official, on blazemonger.com/gg on the whatsnew section it says they're goign to replace it. But it's almost inexcusable to release an album like this. I ordered mine for 7.99 before I was told about this. however, i believe that it won't be bad because i think they're selling that cheap because they're going to be replaced soon, free of charge. at least i hope so.Any ways, this album features some of the band's most complex songs, and isn't my favorite album, but it is definitely really good and worth buying. Sorry for short review, but I can't think of much else to say about it."
2,Poor mix (WHERE'S THE GUITAR?!?!?!?!?!),"I just got this CD yesterday and am terribly disappointed. Whoever mixed this remaster screwed up in a huge way. Gary Green's guitar tracks are mostly missing from the album. Sure there's some there on Give it Back and Empty City, but most of the rest is entirely absent. The guitar solos are mostly there, but they are sometimes painfully loud and harsh.The CD also has a rather bland sound stereophonicly (or is it even in stereo?). The sound quality could also have benefitted from more treble / high end frequency response, but that's a complaint I've had about some of the other releases as well.You'd think that DRT would have better quality control. At the very least, someone with some knowledge of music should of at least listened to thing before distributing it."
3,BUH!!!!!!!!!,"Interview contains my favorite Gentle Giant song ever;thatsong is ""Design"". The whole structure of the song is unique andvery unpredictable.The vocal rounds on this song are GG's best;they're complex and very funny at the same time and do a verygood job interpreting the very sad lyrics. The percussion and thewierd sound effects in the middle of the song are hilarious, butmy favorite part is Derek Shulman's vocal entrance at the startof verse two. As for the rest, "" I lost my head"" is a perfectcombination of GG's medieval and melodic side and their hard rockside. The second half of the track was a sign of things to comefor GG. The title track is another great song, showing off theirwonderful sense of humour. The low point of the album, for me, is""Timing"", which has some very annoying vocals in it and some veryheadache inducing violin playing! INTERVIEW may not be GG's bestalbum, but it definitely has it's moments!"
5,Wonderful results!,"I've been using this iron for about 3 months i can tell that it make difference. Not only that my hair is straight, but it's also silky and shiny ( compared to the results after hair dryer). I have wavy ( not curly) hair and it takes me about 15-20 minutes to style my hair. And i have a lot of hair! I've recommended this iron to a friend of mine who has curly har and she couldn't be happier. Just make sure that you use iron protector before using it and you'll be amaized by results."
4,It really is worth the money!,"I purchased this flat iron because I'm tired of spending money to get my hair done at the salon on a regular basis. I was sketpical of buying it, but figured if it didn't work I could return it. I am African-American and I have very thick, curly, long, relaxed hair. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. My hair came out great! It was thicker and a little less straight than if my stylist did it, but MUCH MUCH better than when I'd done it in the past. It won't replace my stylist unfortunately, but it will make my visits less frequent!If you have ethnic hair this will definitely work for you. I think the only reason I'm not speaking more praises of the flat iron is because my hair is honestly some of the thickest and hardest to manage that you'll ever see. Even people at the salon say so! So, I'm sure you'll be more than satisfied!"
3,pretty good,"I replaced my one inch chi w/ this iron because my chi quit working after only 6 months (and I use the th ing maybe once a week...) So, after reading the reviews, I purchased the Sedu. It works ok - not as good as the chi and the tool doesn't feel as posh as the chi. Also, the plastic over the plates gets really hot so you can't really push down, you have to push down right under the plates and I feel that it would be easier to push on the plate area... I might purchase again, not sure."
5,Wonderful Product !!!!,"I read many reviews on this product and other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu. It took me a week to get the product and I anxiously tried it as soon as it arrived. I must say that the products is a dream come true. I am an African American woman and I have never been able to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when going to the salon. When I went back to work from the weekend, my coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked (because it was truly straight). I would recommend this to any woman. I have not been back to the salon in the last 2 months."
2,Works well but unfortunately IT WILL FAIL in less than a year!!!!,"My daughter has been very happy with this straightener, except that our second one in the last 10 months just broke. Just as others have written (SHANTEC gives the best description), the cord will break internally where it connects to the body. The green light will flicker, then it will only work if you hold it in a certain position--making it impossible to use -- and then it will fail completely. The manufacturer should be ashamed of this design which it surely knows about by now. So the bottom line is this: it's a great hair straightener for a little while, until it breaks, and you have to buy a new one. If you don't mind buying a new one frequently, then you should get this one. Otherwise, consider it a waste of money and buy something else."
5,get it! get it! get it!,"Soft, shiny, straight hair that last until you wash it again is what you get when you use this little beauty. still want the chi? think about this for a minute. with the chi, while great, you have run the iron over you hair a few timess to get it straight. with the Sedu--nope. twice max and maybe not even that."
3,It's OK,"I have naturally curly Type 4 hair that I semi-relax.I've used a chi, maxiglide(bought twice)and wigo. SEDU is was just OK. I just returned it.What I liked:1. Super light. MUCH lighter than Maxiglide2. Smoothly glides over hair3. Very fast heat up4. I liked the size of the plates. They were more of a square shape. Made for a fast straightening time.Cons:1. Didn't make my hair shiny like my $30 Tourmaline Wigo! (I'm still in shock)2. The outside gets super hot. I mean, REALLY hot!When I curl my hair I'll sometimes lightly hold the barrel for a sec or two.Not with this flat iron.I'm still on the hunt for my perfect flat iron. I want to look like i just stepped out of a salon :)"
3,Product ok... I think,"The product seems to work fine but I'm not sure the iron they gave me was new. The box looked vaguely repackaged and there was no paperwork/instructions of any kind -- not in the product box, not in the wrapping box (not even a packing slip). When I turn the iron to medium position or higher, the light blinks. I reported this to ""packaging"" but no one ever replied. Anyway... It works fine now, but I wouldn't be surprised it didn't last long."
1,Counterfeit. Beware!,"Counterfeit!! Bought Oct 15 and it stopped turning on on Jan 15, so at exactly 3 months old. Tried to contact the manufacturer for the warranty info but the item is missing the serial numbers needed. They informed me that it is a counterfeit item which they have been having a lot of issues with. After much prying and a lot of time, Amazon finally refunded. But buyer beware!!"
5,Great product!,Great product - works exactly as advertised and lasts for a while. It's also heating up quickly - so would highly recommend it.
2,Stops working after a bit,"I had one of these flat irons for a few years and it worked great. After about 3 years, it just stopped turning on for no reason. I got a new one and it lasted a year and ended up not turning on again for no reason what so ever one day. Just for the fact that I've had two of the same exact product just stop working in the same way, makes these flat irons too unreliable. Would recommend for someone who doesn't mind buying a brand new one every year."
2,Just buy a Chi.,"My hair is very wavy, dry, and a little course. I read the reviews and I thought this product was going to be right for me. It worked fine at first, but no better than a Chi you could buy at Ulta with a coupon. I was not impressed with the way it straightened. To top it all off, I only bought it in June and it completely stopped working mid March. Save your money and buy a Chi."
3,Just OK,"While I've read some great reviews online about this, and had recommendations from personal friends of how great this product is, I just rate it OK. I don't really feel that it works any better than the $30 straightener I previously had bought from Wal-Mart. It does get hot and I haven't had any technical problems with it, I just feel it doesn't take away the frizz as much as I think it should. My hair is frizzy, however I put product in to tame the frizz, and still no change.My suggestion would be to save your $100 and purchase something cheaper at your local store. Or, substantially increase your investment in a straightner and speak with your stylist about what they use."
1,Don't spend the money,"I bought this after buying into the many rave reviews and was rightfully disappointed. My hair was not ""softer, silkier, or smoother than ever!"". The plate edges are straight rather than beveled, and clamp rather than float, so it does not glide through your hair without catching the ends and DOES leave impression marks. The swivel cord is so rigid that my iron will only lay on it's side.I just can't imagine what the other reviewers were using before they bought this over-priced, average, hair appliance."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"My hair is naturally curly, but also professionally straightened with a cold smooth system. My stylist told me you get what you pay for when it comes to straightening irons, so I decided to order the Sedu. What a disappointment! It works no better than the straightening iron I bought at Sharper Image a couple years ago, which costs less than half the price of the Sedu. I've now had two stylists recommend the Chi and think I will try that. Don't waste your money on the Sedu!"
2,Unsafe,"In Quantum physics, when you send negative ions around the space you are in they can often cause there to be overpopulation of these negative ions compared to the positives in your body, this can cause a unbalance in how your body and mind functions. This device will eventually do just that."
1,Short term life,"This iron worked very well for about 4 months. Unexpectedly the cord stopped working and I was no longer able to use this flat iron. I have used Sedu in the past but this model was terrible, unless I just got a lemon."
1,Iron broke in two months,"This was a great hair straightener for two months. Then two months and four days after I bought it, it just stopped cold as I was straightening my hair. I used it twice a week at a 360 degree setting, and it had done a great job before it broke a little more than two months later. Save your money and buy another brand!"
2,NOT so Great,"After using this for about a week, I found that it was no better than a cheaper brand I was previously using. The iron gets super hot and there is no place to hold on to it without burning your hand. I don't know if they are all like this or if mine was defective. For the price, I was not impressed."
2,We bought several books in this series before I realized I just don't like them that much,"Can't fault the art, it's a great way to introduce kids to Monet.And the text... well, I can take it or leave it. It sounds trite to my ears, though, so I prefer to leave it.The really bad part about these books is that they're cheaply made. I've had them fall apart on me while other books that we've had longer and that we read more often are in great shape.You can't have a poor-quality board book, it just doesn't work.I can't in good conscience recommend these books to anybody because of that."
5,Un Excelente Método para,"aprender Inglés sin Maestro. Por eso se titula asi: Quien posea el libro, posee el inglés.Y es verdaderamente sencillo:Si le dedicas una hora al día, en menos de dos meses, ua hablarás y comprenderás !"
4,Enchanting music,EL Fonoun is a palestinan folk troop that uses traditional intruments harmonies. - it has a purity and sincerity that is lacking in modern music - there is something truly captivating about it - though a secular it has a spirtual quality.I only wish it were longer.
4,"I loved it , smart selections","i hope that the band issue another longer CD with more old palestinian songs , not marriage songs only. but I recommend this CD to all Middle eastern Song lovers."
4,A Nice Read,"This version of Robin Hood goes along pretty well with most of the traditional Robin Hood stories. One difference is that Robin, the Earl of Locksley and Huntington, actually squandered away his fortune and poached the King's deer for love of the hunt rather than out of necessity. His lands were then confiscated by King Henry and he was named outlaw for resisting arrest.For those who like strong women characters, this Maid Marian (who's real name is Matilda) can use a sword, quarter-staff, and shoot a bow as well as Robin. She also loves to hunt and likes being out in Nature.The only complaint I have is that some of the characters, Friar Tuck for instance, tend to be rather long winded. Other than that I enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone interested in Robin Hood."
2,Not Nearly The Best Of It's Type,"The canon matte photo paper produces much better looking photos, and usually costs less. The only positive I can say about this brand is that it is much easier to tell which side to print on than Canon."
1,"Don't buy, no matter what printer you have!","You'd think Kodak paper would work in a new Kodak copier! The Kodak copier itself is FANTASTIC with the better quality papers. But this plain photo paper always gets stuck in the printer. When you feel the page, it's all sticky. I called Kodak's customer service. He said, ""Feel the page. Is it sticky? Then that's the problem."" Yeah, right. I already knew that. He hinted that it was a bad batch. Maybe yes, maybe no. But it seems from Reviews that I'm not the first person to have this problem."
2,You get what you pay for,It's not thick enough like regular photo prints you would get from a store. I would recommend spending some more money and getting good paper if you really want quality photographs.
2,Glorified Cardstock. Ugh.,"I was expecting a paper that had a really *really* light satin finish, some sort of surfacing, anyway. All I got was a pack of overpriced cardstock. The only thing going for this paper is that the blacks really print out *black* and that it dries fast. I was expecting more, though, from a pack that calls itself photo paper."
3,Standard quality photo paper,Needed photo paper & ordered Kodak due to the trusted name. Felt like good regular photo paper. I especially appreciated the fact that I could get the MATTE finish.
4,PHOTO PAPER,"KODAK Photo Paper for Inkjet Prints/Gloss, 8.5in x 11in - 100 sheetsIDEAL PAPER FOR PERFECTING THE QUALITY OF YOUR PHOTO AND FOR PROVIDING COPIES OF YOUR PHOTOS TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS. QUALITY OF PHOTOS SHOULD BE MORE THAN ACCEPTABLE TO ADVANCED AMATEURS."
1,Not a good reference book,"As a first book on Verilog this is not a good book. I could not find any thing I was looking for in the index. There is only about a quarter of a page on memories and only a four line example. Most of the examples were poor and incomplete. This book is not for beginners. I found about four other books that were good references, such as A Verilog HDL Primer, Third Edition by J. Bhasker and Verilog HDL: Digital Design and Modeling by Joseph Cavanagh. Both books have good examples and explanations. If your just starting out buy these two books and not Verilog HDL by Samir Palnitkar."
1,Buy the 1st edition,"I looked at this book to learn Verilog 2001. This book is not it. The book doesn't cover the most basic constructs of Verilog 2001 such as always @(*) and the reduced verbosity of entity declarations. Also, the author does not cross-reference a feature with what standard supports it. This makes it worthless as a reference for both the new and old standard. If you want to learn Verilog 2001, wait for a better book. If you want to learn the old standard, buy his 1st edition."
1,Concentrates too much on behavioral code,"Like the other Verilog books I've read, this one seems to be a manual for those who wish to model rather than those who wish to synthesize actual circuits. The book concentrates too much on behavioral code and gate level design, neither of which are as important or as difficult as synthesizable code."
3,Warning about Verilog 2001,"The 2nd Edition of this book should be renamed, ""Verilog 2001 HDL"". Palnitkar added Verilog 2001 to this edition but neglected to mention the difference between Verilog and Verilog 2001 in his text. For example in his 2nd edition he says that arrays can be declared with any number of dimensions. But he fails to add that is only true for Verilog 2001. Many simulators and synthesis tools don't support all of verilog 2001 yet so you may have trouble getting the example code working in a real design."
2,Awful reference source,"I used this book to learn Verilog and if you read it from beginning to end, you might learn the gist of the language...but that's it. The book is virtually useless as any kind of reference source. The index is almost unusable (if you want to learn about the keywords ""fork"" or ""join"", for example, good luck. They aren't even listed in the index, along with just about everything else). Descriptions of how the language works are cryptic and overly brief, though the examples are sometimes helpful.I seldom write reviews of books, but this one has annoyed me so much that I felt compelled to do so.All in all, it's better than no book at all, but not much better."
2,"Good, but I think Moorby and Thomas is better","This is a popular book and it does the job well, but I think the Verilog text by Moorby and Thomas is better. These two authors were involved with the development of the language, one teaches at CMU. I'd rather learn the difficult parts of the language (timing, for example) from someone who knows whats going on at the lower levels and someone with teaching experience. I mention these facts because I think the difference shows in this text. The formatting, grammar, language is good but not polished. I really don't understand why the Moorby and Thomas book is not more popular, marketing I suppose."
4,A good intro to Verilog and a great Verilog PC simulator.,"This book provides good, methodical introduction to Verilog that is excellent for those familiar with programming languages. One of the best parts, though, is the great PC-based Verilog simulator included with the book (it's worth the price of the book by itself). The simulator allows you to try out small (and not-so-small) examples to really get a feel for the Verilog language."
5,verilog HDL,"Excellent beginning work for the new EE grad. Having already accepted a position in ASIC design, I read this book over the summer and was able to immediately write complex test plans for new designs. Next challenge: design.Still keep the book on the shelf for reference although others try to borrow it."
2,good book but not complete,"like any beginner else, i felt that this book is to broad and not specific. The examples are to simple and the problems are to severe compare with they're examples. i've send an email to mr.Samir about the rest answer that not complete from his book, but till now there is no answer."
3,Joe English 1987 Gospel Album.,"I first heard of Joe English (Band) through his excellent 1985 album, What You Need, that really is a top class Gospel rock recording.To be honest Back To Basics: English 101 does not have the same power of What You Need, however the further in to the CD I got the better it was.Track 8, Behold The Glory, regarding The Son Of God, is excellent, as is Track 9 This Must Be Love and the closer, How Sweet It Is, is an adaptation of the Motown classic.The sounds are very 1980s syntheziers, drum machines, guitars and clear vocals, the latter is just as well, as the printed lyrics are minute!"
4,Fish,"This fish seems so real that it scard both of my grandsons and they refused to play it. I recomend this toy for 5 years old or olderMy grandsons, at the time, we bought it for them was 2 and 3 yrs. old....Now the oldest one, just turned 5 and he likes the fish, now, a lot. Fun toy...but remember to not buy it for the very young tots."
2,save your money & use your drill/driver,"This tool works great if you drive the screw perfectly perpendicular to the sheetrock and hit the stud, otherwise it stinks.Tension is required in the fastener to engage the gears, so if you miss the stud, there is no screw removal with this tool. If you end up at an angle the screw pops off before it reaches the correct depth.Other than the belt clip, which is convienient, my cordless drill works just as good without the hitches."
3,A Book Before Its Time,"Upon reading 'Andros Before Our Time' by native Bahamian Earthel Moxey, I was both intrigued by the author's knowledge of Androsian folktales and at the same time somewhat disappointed in the way he chose to present them. His depictions of Andros as a wild island steeped in superstition and myth were extremely accurate, but the stories tended to get varitably choppy in random places. Still, I would recommend Moxey's book to anyone interested in the Bahamas, especially those interested in the mysterious and colorful Andros Island. It was indeed a very necessary book, and I hope the author continues to seek out as-of-yet unrecorded Bahamian folklore to record for future generations. As a college student majoring in writing, this book exceeded all of my expectations by providing me with ample amounts of writing fuel and inspiration on my current story subject, Andros Island."
4,Really nice black+white photos...,"I very much like the photos presented in this book. I am not familiar with the photographer or his work, my review is based solely on my impression from the photos in this particular book. I happen to enjoy changing cloud formations. I found it interesting that he included the man-made world for size comparison--it reminded me somewhat of Art Sinsabaugh's work. I kinda wish the book had more photos to it (it's on the slim side), but I do like the fact that each photo occupies an entire page."
3,Detailed Artwork for...?,"While this book was incredibly beautiful to look at, it's not going to be easy finding uses for this clip art. Since I usually use Dover books for collage, rubber stamping and art purposes this wasn't so great for me. The images are so VERY detailed that most of the engravings are dark and shades of gray. They are finished pieces of art in their own way (not good for collage or taking parts of the image out to combine with other things.)I would only recommend this book for people who are looking for inspiration for drawing water or ships. These detailed pen drawings are really beautiful, just way more detailed than most clip art books. It is possible that you could still use these images for collage on a large scale, but you can't shrink most of these images without making them black (too small of lines.) This over-sized book (9.5"" x 12"") has such large images, many pages only having 2 or 3 images on them."
3,Not what I hoped for.,I was looking for a book with more detailed drawings of old fleet ships. This is okay but doesn't meet my needs.
2,Did not come with mounting hardware,"Warning, this did not come with any mounting hardware. The picture shows screws, but it did not come with anything. After talking with InterDesign, they said it ""might"" come with ""nylon loops"" - we'll see if I am able to get those shipped to me. I bought this from a Third Party Vendor through Amazon (Life and Home) and it arrived at my house in filthy condition - I had to wash and scrub the dirt off. The rack is pretty and what I wanted, though."
5,Profound and Comprehensive,"Mr Fung Yu-Lan's writing is very comprehensive and profound. It gives a very good background knowledge on the Chinese Philosophy throughout the ages and what really shapes Chinese to behave, act and think they way they do in the current context. There is a lot of differences between Western Philosophy and that of Chinese per se. Good read but have to digest slowly. Not a book to be read at one go. Pause and think as you read. Mr Fung is perhaps, in my opinion, one very knowledgeable researcher and writer on this said topic. Bravo! Steven Lim (RSTN)."
1,Useless and Slanted.,"This book should have been titled "" The US Constitution - A socialist's viewpoint"" because thats what it actually contains.He rambles on about the 2000 presidential election, how Bush did not win the popular vote. Does this info belong in a book about the inner workings of the constitution? I don't think so.Mr Cooke also does not recognize our form of government as a Federal Republic. He refers to it in other terms.He completely neglects to mention that the main source of ideas for the US Constitution was Christian beliefs as interpreted by John Locke, an English Philosopher and Scholar, although he mentions John Locke in passing.Don't waste your money. Amazon has much better material on our country's great documents than this. Keep looking."
4,STANDARD CATALOG OF WORLD GOLD COINS,"GREAT BOOK, HOWEVER, COMPLETELY FORGOT TO MENTION ANY COINS FROM THE NETHERLANDS, IE: KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS-1815-DATE."
2,Standard Catalog Of World Gold Coins 5th Ed,The present 5th Edition mainly repeats the previous 4th Ed.Despite it claims the catalog contains almost no coins of 1500s.The whole country of Netherlands left out of the catalog.

3,Package,The package & the book is acceptable.But the mailing period is too long. It seems to take more than 1 month
5,Whipped Make-up,I love this make-up; I have and oily complexion that causes my mascara nad eye make-up to run; but the whipped make-up goes on smoothly and helps my complexion look very nice; and helps to keep my eye make-up from running.
4,Good but not his best,"Smoke Jensen takes 3,500 head of cattle up into Montana to sell to the neighbor of Clint Black, a man who would try anything to desuade or prevent anyone from doing something black does not want to happen. But trying to stop Jensen is like trying to stop an 18 ft. hole in Hoover Dam with a cotton swab."
5,Informative,"Students will get a lot out of this well written volume about a terrible disease that strikes far too many women. The language is clear and concise, the facts accurate, and the bibliography extensive and up to date. Adults who want more information than Nardo provides can look up one or more of the books he cites."
5,ken curtis at his best,"As a small child I could not sleep on friday nights because the next chapter of ""Don Daredevil"" would be showing the next day at the local picture show. As a confirmed ""front row kid"" I saw all the serials of the time and this one stands out in my memory as one of the best. I cannot say that this is good adult fare but it is one of the best of the genre."
4,Developmental Profile Overview,"An easy read... The information is quite familiar, if you have read other materials on health, safety, development, and nutrition issues for young children. The enclosed CD-ROM provides real and practical examples of classroom settings, setup, and activities--based on age."
3,"Decent, for the most part.","I use this book, along with The City Reader, in one of my classes. It provides a decent foundation with pieces by many of the classic urbanists and early planners, and that's important. However, many of the articles I find repeating each other in general theme, so when one is assigned multiple readings using this text the readings can feel tedious. Also, none of the articles (as far as I know) are complete versions of the author's original piece, making the selected portions feel weaker and often out of context. Hopefully a revised edition will find the editors including more of the original pieces. Overall, the book is a decent one if all you want is something to lay a basic foundation for urban planning. Anything more than that, and you may find it beneficial to find the original writings featured in the book. The City Reader is a better reader with many of the same authors, so I would recommend picking that up over this one."
1,TOTAL WASTE!!!,"This is probably the most useless book ever written, and fully establishes there is only ONE thing to do with a tornado tube, and you certainly don't need a book to tell you what it is. Some of the 'wacky' experiments in this book include:- Rolling the tube to see how far it goes- Dumping the water out of the tube (and timing yourself)- Putting a pencil in the tube (instant pencil holder - Wacky!)- Putting other little toys in the bottle (weird AND wacky!!!)- Putting it on paper as a paperweight!!!Well, I made the last one up, but I was fully expecting to see it somewhere when reading.The first half of the book doesn't talk about tornado tube experiments at all, but about various weather patterns. Nice, but if I want to learn about cold fronts I'll buy a weather book.Don't buy this book. Steve Spangler is so cool and I can't believe he released this ridiculous item."
3,"A bit outdated, but useful","This book needs to be updated, especially the information on sales and marketing. ""Housewives"" today probably make up considerably less market than bistros. It also advocates using multiflora rose as a fence, which was popular 20 years ago. Most areas are now trying to eradicate this uncontrollable, nasty weed. There is also little info on domestic ducks. The book does, however, provide some good info and is worth the $12."
2,Boring and Disappointing!,"Thin, aloof, pseudo-scholarly, and theoretical.With headings such as ""Pheasant Propagation"", and subheadings such as ""Sound Management Practices"", this book tries really hard to be the kind of book you might read in some college class. However, at barely 1/4"" thick it fits a very narrow focus. As an example, the last chapter (entitled ""Developing a Game Bird Preserve"") is barely 6 pages long!Much more useful for wildlife management professionals, than lay persons. Very little basic information. A ""2-star"" rating is being generous!"
1,"super seal pro 946 kit didn't work for me,","I pulled 30 inches of vacuum for 30 minutes on my Chevrolet s-10 pickup . I installed Cliplight's ss pro 946 kit per instructions. My s-10's ac blew ice cold at first (38 degrees) for like 3 weeks (same as last year) ,then I noticed the ac's not as cold. Now it's lucky to get to 70 degrees. It's obviously leaking. $85 wasted (3 cans 134a synthetic and ss pro kit).The ss pro 946 kit is supposed to seal any existing and new leaks.A lot of great reviews but I do not think I will use again as SS Pro did NOT fix my trucks problem.A heads up: the red and blue tamper proof caps are NOT included in the kit any longer.You get the 1.5 oz. can of sealer, installation hose/tap and label in the box."
4,Works well installed per directions.,Installed 3 weeks ago in car that had not had AC for 2 years. So far has stayed cool. I am pleased.Detailed directions somewhat confusing. Should give overview of general theory before details. Otherwise someone could get confused and put the sealant before charging the system. That would probably be a disaster.
4,Does the Job,"My AC stopped working because the freon level had leaked off. At first I simply added enough freon to bring up the pressure, but this soon (2 weeks) leaked off. I then purchased the Super Seal Pro Kit, added the freon to bring it up to normal pressure; added the contents of the kit and let the vehicle run for 20 minutes. Its been over a month and so far, no loss of freon. My only complaint: the instructions are whacky. The instructions seem to be written for a case in which there is total loss of vacuum. In my case, and I imagine, most cases this is not the case. Therefore you can ignore their long complicated procedure and just do as I did above."
1,Stop leak,"I make sure follow instruction from label such as after 5 minutes vacuum and pressure still holding 23 psi requirment , no air in system by vacuum and recharge the amount freon per Auto manufacture with the Leak Repair Kit. Result ""Clog up expansion valve "". Help Help."
3,Did not seal my leak,I had hoped that this product would have sealed whatever leak I have in my auto A/C but it did not work. I had cold air for about two weeks and cool air for about two more. I do not know the extent of my leak so I cannot totally fault this product.
3,Questionable,"Well, the content of the can were suppose to be vacumn packed and should have come out similar to how freon does when using a hose. That did not happen so we had to hand hold the can and let it drip for one-half hour to get as much of the contents in the ac as possible. So far, it appears it has sealed the leak somewhat but not enough time has passed to know for sure since leak is small and would talk at least 2-3 weeks to determine validity of product."
2,High Hopes Went Up In Smoke,"Cliplight Manufacturing 946KIT Super Seal Pro A/C Leak Repair KitI've had problems for a couple of years with my auto air conditioner (a 2000 Chrysler product) and believed the main problem to be with a leak in the dryer, which is a real pain in the a.. to change on my particular car. After using a couple of cheaper brands of sealants and recharging the refrigerant 2 or 3 times in the past to no avail, I decided to buy and try the Super Seal. I followed the detailed directions to the letter; and the air conditioner worked ok for about 1 1/2 weeks but then went kaput again. The previous attempts at sealing the system may have interfered with the efficacy of this product. My neighbor, who is a certified HVAC technician, told me has had good luck with this company's products in other refrigeration applications. In my opinion, it's worth spending the money on a can of this stuff and trying it before spending ""big money"" to get your auto air repaired."
5,Works!!,"I had given up all hope when I came across this product. When I recharged with it the first time, the coolness kind of went down in 2 weeks. I had a little left in the can so I used again (I know that's not recommended). Now its been 6 months and its 100 degrees here and my car is as cool as ever. Thumbs up!"
5,Works as advertised,"2000 Dodge Dakota leaking. Dealer estimated $1,000 for the repair. Followed directions to the letter and AC is working great. BTW - I did this 3 years ago... Hopefully you will experience good results as well. I live in Arkansas. Temps here exceeded 100 degrees multiple times this summer."
5,Cliplight Manufacturing 946KIT Super Seal Pro A/C Leak Repair Kit,"This product is fantastic!! When I noticed there was a leak on the lower-side port AC hose, and I installed this Super Seal Pro A/C leak repair kit can along with a couple cans of R134a Freon onto the lower side port on my 1997 Ford Expedition 4WD with a Rear AC system. I drove it around town for about two hours or so. Surprisingly, it sealed to leaks permanently, and I could feel a Cold AC coming out from all the vents. This is an excellent product for everyone to use and safe in every way."
1,Not Happy,"The instructions say to connect the can to the supplied hose, turn the can upside down and allow contents to empty into the car's AC system. Well the can ""emptied"" alright, but only into the attached hose, not fully into the car's AC system. So when I detached the hose from the car (because the can was ""empty""), you guessed it, this EXPENSIVE sealant went rushing out of the hose and onto my garage floor. Not happy."
1,Does not work!!!,"Used as instruction said to the letter, rub dishwashing solution where leak was, 30 mins later leak still there.Don't waste your money on this."
1,i must be one of the unlucky ones,"i used this exactly my 98 chev cavalier per instructions, just turned 100k. NO LUCK! what a waste of money for me. all but 2 reviews raved about it so i thought whats another 30 something bucks if it worked. i guess you take the gamble and you win or lose. loser here! i did read that you must use freon right after using this or the port will clog. wouldnt that figure??? the only thing this stuff stops is the low side port???"
1,"Bad design, won't charge battery","I've been trying and trying to get this to work, and it won't.Design-wise, it's awkward: the battery doesn't slip in easily, and there's a little catch on one end that makes it difficult to decide which end of the battery ought to go in first.Secondly - and more importantly - it won't charge my batteries!Well. I'm off to buy a different brand - maybe I'll see if I can get a *SONY* product that will work!"
1,BAD ELECTRIC CONTACTS... IT DOES NOT CHARGE MY BATTERY...,"From the first time I used this product it failed to charge my battery... I have to use a pair of small pieces of aluminium foil placed between the battery and the charger's contacts in order to make it work. However it may be dangerous and I prefer to buy a new battery-charger (not of the same brand, of course...)"
1,NEVER WORKED,This charger never worked at all. Luckily I found my old charger and didn't care any more.
4,2lost in....them,"i love sugababes,their voice is amazing.....i love everysong......hole in the head is a fun song,caught up in the middle is had a catchy beat,the vid is ok!!!but i have 2say that the most beautiful song in the album is TOO LOST IN YOU,that was the best Xmas song!!!!!!"
5,Simply Breathtaking!,"I've been a fan of Sugababes ever since their debut single 'Overload' came out here in the UK. Now, they've recently released what seems to be their BEST album yet! Here's my review of their third album, simly titled THREE:Well, the album starts of with the funky Hole In The Head, then followed by the utterly amazing Whatever Makes You Happy (sung entirely by Keisha). Caught In A Moment and Sometimes are amazingly stunning, and I think Heidi's voice is just breathtaking. Million Different Ways is my favorite track 'cos it just has this unique, funky upbeat tune. We Could Have It All sounds like a left-over from Angels With Dirty Faces but it's still great. I must say Situation's Heavy is the worst song, but it's still kinda good. Nasty Ghetto and Buster just blew my mind away when I first heard them.Well, what're you waiting for? BUY IT!"
3,Classic dysfunctional family movie,"While this movie was enjoyable, it was a little silly. I would recommend it but only to someone who can look at it for what it is a movie."
4,This movie is unbelievably real!,"I first started to watch this movie last June, and saw up to the middle of it numerous times after. I thought that the casting was great, Laura (Hillary Wolfe) is completely natural and believable. I could relate to the adolescence of this film. I was disappointed when I finally viewed the ending, however; I expected a great finish to what started out to be an awesome movie. I still recommend it to all teens who struggle with family. Don't miss it!!"
5,Realistic and very funny!,"For a while I could relate to this girl's problems and things eventually got better, but I realized how real the movie is. I know exactly how she feels! It's very funny and hard to remember all the characters, which I guess was the objective! The plot is interesting, the acting is good, the script is solid and funny, and nothing lacks around character development. Don't miss ""Big Girls Don't Cry...They Get Even!"""
5,"I love this movie, brings back so many memories :)",Big Girls don't cry came in the mail quicker then it said it would which is good everything is in good shape although i did get it brand new. everything is packaged nicely and it is a classic that i absolutely LOVE! If you are a 80's or 90's kid i recommend You get this movie. however My parents (born in 60's) even love it :)
1,"Written by an insider, with the skills of a hack","Sorry to be harsh, but this isn't a very good novel. It mostly suffers from two things 1. Clumsy characterization. The characters are barely sketched out and seem mostly there to dole out huge heaping lumps of amatuerish exposition. They do dumb things not out of human fraility but because the author needs to advance the plot. 2. The prose is purple and riddled with the most banal cliches like ""wiry little man"" and ""lyric psalms"" and describing sunshine on windows as the reflection of ""orange energy"". There are plenty of mawkish scenes, such as the scene of an IRA assasination being described as a place where children in their ""Sunday best"" cling to their parents who, boo-hoo, realize the Troubles, aye the Troubles are still with us.If you're looking for an ""insider"" view of the ATF, look elsewhere(...)"
5,jerry herman a sapronos delight,this score was purchased after bosum buddies from mame was sung in a local competition.the performance enlivened the audience. this success lead to discovering more music by jerry herman.this lead to a treasure trove of performance songs for 2009.some of these are wherever he aint from mack and mabel the best of time from la cage aux follies and i am what i am from the same show.there are many such songs.any singer preparing numbers now for the new year would be advised to buy it.it would be handy for singing teachers for their students.
2,Disappointment For What Was Not Included,"Very incomplete. There have been the lyrics of Cole Porter, Ira Gerswhin and Lorenz Hart that have included the lyrics to all the songs written for a show even those that were never used. Some songs had alternate lyrics as well. These seem to be the definitive edition of their works.Too bad this could have been as comprehensive of a study of one of the best Broadway composers. Sadly its incomplete escpecially lacking is his ealier works or his most recent works (Mrs Santa Clause and Miss Spectacular)Give it 2 stars for the songs that were included."
4,Makes it look easy,I bought this after borrowing it from the library. I have no experience with paint. This book made it less scary.
5,Get This Book!,"Not to be blasphemous, but this book is literally the ""Bible"" for fishing the Chesapeake Bay. It is fantastic. I have learned so much from it. My copy is dog-eared and marked up with notes that I can't even loan it to friends to read...not that I would risk doing that for fear they would keep it!"
2,Cal's Rolling in his grave over this one,"This is an awful book for two primary reasons: 1. It portrays Coolidge in the unfair, stereotypical light that people have done for decades. (thus it lacks any new thought) 2. The book, mechanically speaking, is also poor. It is difficult to read, dry, and gives the reader no incentive to continue reading. The only reason I gave Ferrell a second star is because he is smart enough to pick a good topic to write his book about."
5,This is a an extremely well written book.,"I first heard of this book in school when we did a extensive report on it. This is probable the best book I have ever read. And Homecoming the book that started this saga is eaqualy well written. Of corse this book Isn't for everyone, But if you like heartfelt books, and are willing to patiently read through it, this Tillerman Saga is for you."
2,"So-So, but not the best!","I've have read other books by this author that are a whole lot better. In the begginning, I thought that I would die before it got a plot. It is better, but with a little ajustments, it could be GREAT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,the story is deep sad and boring all at once,"Dicey has had a hard summer keeping her two brothers and one sister alive. She starts a new life with her grandmother near Chesapeake Bay, gets a job and starts school. Her essay she writes for school is some of the only info on her menally ill mother. The most poignant part of the story is the end and it takes a while to get going.overall a pretty good book."
4,Excellent Book!,"I thought that Dicey's Song! It is just the type of book I like, realistic fiction. I could NEVER put the book down. And I guarantee you won't be able to either! I liked it so much, one morning I got up at 6 am so I could finish it. I plan on reading the rest of Tillerman cycle because of Dicey's Song.I would recommend this to ever girl aged 12-14. Once again, it was excellent!"
4,Book2-Dicey's Song,"This was the first book I read in the Tillerman Cycle an when I finished I read the others right away.Dicey has finally found a home for herself and her brothers and sister. But now she has to start a new school year and help support her family. She finally starts to live a normal life, that is until Gram gets a letter from Boston about their sick mother. Will Dicey be able to start a new life and let go of the control she has over her family's life ?I recommend this book to anyone who liked Pictures of Hollis Woods."
4,Thought-provoking story fluid in beautiful prose.,"Cynthia Voight has created a thoughtful piece of literature, telling of Dicey, whose complexities far outweigh those of the average 13-year-old. She paints incredible pictures of the life of Dicey and her family with flowing, descriptive prose; the book would not be the same without it."
3,Bookcrazy,I Loved the book but I kept on getting very confuised at time and I have to go back and reread it. I think the writer could have told the story a bit more discriptive on some the parts.But other than that I Loved the story
5,Dicey's Song,"As I picked up this book I grew enthralled, watching Dicey, the main character, develop a more interesting personality. If Homecoming, the first book in this series was about the Tillerman family finding an identity, this book was about Dicey finding her identity. Throughout the plodding plot of this book, there are many twists and turns, but the amazing thing that Cynthia Voigt creates are the emotions. As I read this book I would be as annoyed at Gram or Sammy as Dicey, or as happy to see Mina, a friend. Another great aspect of this book, that I touched upon, were the characters. Aside from Dicey, this book is overflowing with characters so vivid you expect to see them sitting next to you. Overall, this was a splendid book, which anyone would enjoy."
4,Dicey's Song,"If you are ever looking for a great realistic fiction book I suggest reading Dicey's Song by Cynthia Voigt. It is about a girl named Dicey Tillerman, a 13 year old girl who had to move with her 4 other siblings to her Grandmothers house after her mom ""dissapeared"", causing her to start a new school and a new life that she does not like. In the course of the book Dicey learns many of the most important lessons in life, learning that she can't take care of everyone without taking care of herself, and learning to let go of something very important. I enjoyed the book because it was so realistic how it focused on this family, who is struggling with money and trying to live a happy, normal life."
2,"So,So, but a little Boring!!",I thought that the book was okay. It could have been a lot better book. It kinda lost my interest because it was so interested in Dicey's troubles. WHO REALLY CARES???
1,Boring and Hard to understand,"My class is reading this book and the assignment is to do a report. But, the book was so boring I couldn't understand it and it kept saying the same thing over and over. I can't keep reading that so, I lost interest. In the first 30 pages all it talks about is how she is doing while she's living with her grandmoter. I give it 1- star for not having a real plot and no real action that will make you want to know what happens next."
1,The author goes on and on about stupid little things,"I really hated this book because it was so boring and I really didn't like Dicey. I thought that the author of this book went on and on about stupid little things that made the book really boring. If there was a sequel to Diceys song I think that Maybeth will get really good at the piano, and Diceys boat will look nice. If there is a sequel I would not like to read it because it will probably be as boring as Diceys song. I hope I never have to read any other books by Cynthia Voigt."
1,This book had absolutley no point to it!,"When I read this book, I was totally bored at the pointlessness of it. The whole book was about this girl who just lives her life. Why would you want to read about this girl just going about her daily buisness? I don't know how anyone can enjoy it. I being a young adult,(the base for this book)thought it was also very unrelistic how they described Dicey."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"I had to read this book durring the summer and I suffered all through it. I hated it and the writing style was crummy...Ugggggggggggh. If you are going to by a book here, don't buy Dicey's Song. In the book, she doesn't even sing a song."
3,Dicey's Song,"This book is about a thirteen year-old girl named Dicey and her brothers James and Sammy and her sister May Beth. Their mother abandoned them when they were all going to the mall. Now they are going to live with their grandmother they have never even met before. She is making new friends at her new school and maturing to a woman. Everything is going perfect! May Beth is finally getting good grades. Then their mom is near death, she is dying in the hospital up north where they have grown up. They take a trip up there to go see how their mother is doing, but they make a wrong turn!!!!! Read the book to see what happens next. I thought this book was okay. There were some boring parts, but there were some real good parts that made up for the boring parts. I strongly recommend you read this."
3,Great book/not in great shape,"This 2nd book in the Tillerman series (Dicey's Song) continues the fascinating story of this band of interesting siblings. However, I was quite disappointed with the condition of this paperback book. The cover was beat up and the pages looked as if they'd gotten wet and then dried out into ripples -- I'm sure you've seen this happen! No pages missing, though!"
2,Kind of plain,"This book was not the best I've ever read. It could've been a lot better. The descriptions were kind of plain and not very vivid. Read this book if you like realism and real-life stories, but don't waste your time if you don't."
5,The book was about a girl's struggle to keep her sibs alive.,"I think Dicey's Song was an excelent book! Not many books hold my attention very well and this one I was glued to it 24-7 until I finished it. Homecoming was read to me and when it was done I was in suspense until I read this. What a great book! I praise Cynthia Voigt for how much time she spent writing it. I'm glad I had the honor to read this book and I hope everyone appreciates is as much as I did. If you think this is a good book read (if you already haven't) Homecoming. This book is the sequil to Homecoming. Other books by the author, Cynthia Voigt, Building Blocks and A Tree By A Leaf."
1,Shattered,The cabinet came shattered in box terrible packing .you would think they would pack glass in something other then peanuts!
5,FABULOUS Camera & Buy,"This is a fabulous camera! The item description does not do it justice by a long shot. This is my first digital camera and before purchsing it I went to the WalMart web site to check out their digitals. The had a 7.1 MP for $50 more so I came back to Amazon and placed the order.The camera has a nice large screen on the back for previewing, 20 MB of internal memory. This is large compared to others for a similar price.The pictures are superb quality. My grandson connected it to the TV for a slide show preview with special effects like an expensive video. I am very, very pleased with this camera!"
4,Samsung Digimax S800 8.1 MP Digital Camera,"I bought this camera to take on a Mexican vacation and could hardly take a bad picture, even at night. Our company travel agent even suggested I submit some to our newspaper's travel editor... A 10X zoom would be nice but it seemed to do well, even with the whale watching -- I couldn't see what I was taking due to the sun's glare but was pleasantly surprised by the pictures I got.I'm only a little peeved because I bought the camera as an Amazon gold box special and the price has gone down another $20 since I purchased it!"
4,good cam for little $$$,"i bought this camera looking for a better 1 than i had ... it works great , was priced good for the .. M/pixels , features , can be a little complicated for someone that has never used 1 , plz read the manual ..."
4,Kids love this book as a read aloud!,"I read this book to my class of first graders and they loved it. After reading the first chapter I thought they were a little bored and asked if they wanted me to continue. They answer was a unanimous ""YES!""Though not classic children's fiction, the children were able to understand a rather complicated story line (for a young reader series) and follow the character development with ease. This was a fun introduction to chapter books."
1,Horrendous,"Horrendous! Hideous! Unacceptable ! I dislike this book because of its lack of seriousness when dealing with the nobility and power of the dragon especially having the main characters kill the dragon, and especially knock knock jokes! I dont like it when the knight kills the dragon but at least both the dragon and the knight tried their best, but have a boy beat a dragon of all things with knock knock jokes? You cant even beat a human that way tell me how do you expect a couple of foolish knock-knock jokes to eliminate such a powerful and supreme beast, the writer should be ashamed of producing such nonsense."
2,Barthelme brother #3 wrote a book,"I'm told that Steve Barthelme is actually a brother to the much better known Fred and Don. I briefly read this book about 10 years ago (when I was in college and reading A LOT), so I don't remember it particularly well. But I think that's the point. It struck me as being competent but ultimately quite mundane. If you're a hard-core Barthelme completionist, I might get it. Otherwise I wouldn't bother."
4,Motorhead - 'Tear Ya Down: The Rarities' (Metal-Is) 4 3/4 stars,"A great 2-CD, total of twenty-five track compilation of never-before-heard VERSIONS of Motorhead songs. Includes some of the better known songs,but what's really nice is that 'Tear Ya Down...' also brings us several 'deep album cuts',that some of us may have not heard in awhile.Like ""Dirty Love"", ""Fast And Loose"", ""Treat Me Nice"", ""Fire Fire""...you get the idea. Don't think I even remotely remember this CD's final tune, ""Step Down"" off of 'Bomber'. Simply smashing British metal, the WAY it ought to be. Highly recommended."
4,May be Goodman's best studio LP,"This LP was where Steve really began to put it all together in the studio. Immaculately, often beautifully produced with an unusually strong mixture of old, forgotten standards and excellent originals. The second half of the album is a Goodman/folkie eye-opener and it's nice to see that the production has been remastered; it deserves it."
4,Not Steve's Best...But Still Better Than Most,"When my wife and I were dating way back in 1977, Steven Goodman came up to Northern Minnesota and played a gig at our college. It was Steve, a battered guitar, a microphone and a circle of 300 college kids. It was magic. Having seen Bob Dylan, The Boss, Lucy Kaplansky and a host of other singer-songerwriters over the past 30 years, that simple performance, in a dimly lit and little used hall on the campus, remains the most memorable concert I've attended. ""The 20th Century is Almost Over"" is Goodman at his finest; witty, musical and maniacal. ""My Old Man"" makes the tears flow. A worthy addition despite one or two sub-par efforts (""Two Lovers"" as an example)."
4,Good tires and good price,"Bought these for my grandson's little Suzuki LT50.With these tires he can get around perfectly now.These tires have a great price, but after adding onthe shipping, I have since found that I could havebought the same tires for less at a couple of otherweb sites.Still, I am pleased with what I got and they shouldlast long past my grandson fitting on his quad runner."
3,ok,"I've only been using this on and off for a year and it's already broken. The motor is a little weak and will catch some hairs and yank them out. The designs are hard to use because you have to hold it with one hand while trimming with the other. It does trim the hair to about 1/8"" but don't expect a smooth shave. All in all it worked fairly well, especially at the beginning."
1,Razor never worked,"This trimmer would've been perfect if it worked. After putting in the battery and trying several other batteries, I gave up hope and purchased a bikini trimmer at Wal Mart. Don't waster your money!"
1,Great idea...if it worked.,"I loved all the different sized head options. The templates are cute as well but I never got to use them. This is very poorly made. I have owned a number of hair trimmers/razors and this one broke the fastest. The plastic pieces are horribly low quality. Mine broke the second time I used it. The heads didn't snap on/off well. Buy a different trimmer, save your money."
5,Another Awesome CD by Jonny Lang,"I wanna say that this cd is awesome, it showcases yet another side of a gifted musician. i've been a fan of Jonny Lang's since day one. It's kinda cool growing up with an artist that's the same age as me 22. ""Lie to Me"" & ""Wander this World"" are awesome albums, but this shows he's in love now, and it also shows his love for his wife. Change is always good for an artist, it just shows how ecclectic or diverse you can be. i don't think he strayed to far from his roots in blues, i think he just added to it a little. my personal favorites are ""Red Light"",""Touch"",""Misery and Happiness"" which Steven Tyler appears on, ""Livin' for the City"" by Stevie Wonder it's an awesome live blues cover of this song, ""Dying to Live"" which Eminem does drum programming, i know that's a little different, ""Beautiful One"" well all in all this is a great CD to own, if you're a person in love then it's for you, if you're not in love it's still for you"
5,Album of the year,I've got all Jonny's albums and he continues to improve with every release. He seems to have changed directon with 'Long Time Coming' but this hasn't affected the class which he's shown in previous albums. I heard 'Red Light' as a promo prior to the release of the album and I think it's the best track closely followed by 'Save Yourself' and 'Beautiful One'.I just wish he would come to Scotland and play live.
2,Major Disappointment,"As a huge Jonny Lang fan I was incredibly disappointed by this album which took 5 years to release. Gone is Jonny's edge and grit, replaced by color by numbers, radio friendly garbage. Not to mention the melodies are unoriginal. If you want a good Jonny Lang CD pickup Wander This World or Lie to Me. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,An Amazing CD,This CD is so good. I love every song and listen to it non-stop. I recomend would recomend it to anyone. I love everything about his music. It is one of my favorite CD's of all time.
1,Jonny got rich and doesn't have the blues anymore,Jonny Lang at times sounds like PRINCE and most of the time is way over produced. What a disappointment! This cd sound like most of the other crap on pop radio. This is the first Jonny Lang cd that I am sorry I bought. I guess he got rich and doesn't have the blues anymore. I do recommend all other Jonny Lang cd's before this and I do think he is a great artist.
5,Long tome coming worth the wait,"All I can say is WOW. I have read a few reviews complaining about the departure from straighforward blues. However, when I buy a new CD, I listen to the whole thing as is if I were listening to an artist for the first time(usually in my car). I try not to bring any pre-concieved notions into the assessment.Jonny's new CD is great. I don't find anything to skip through, which is rare. Usually there are afew songs on a CD that I just have to skip. I highly recommend we support this young man's career. I just hope it doesn't take another three years for more Jonny."
2,I want jonny not stevie,"I DONT KNOW WHOS FAULT IT IS, THE RECORD CO. OR JONNY HIMSELF.IM COMPLETELY DISSAPOINTED.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR THAT GREAT BLUESYMUSIC FROM -LIE TO ME- IT WONT BE ON THIS OVER PRODUCED CD.THE BLUES WASNT GOOD ENOUGH I GUESS.LAST CD OF HIS I BUY WITH OUT LISTENING.GOODBYE JONNY!"
2,This is NOT the Jonny I know...,"I know Jonny Lang - I've seen him in concert, listened to Lie To Me and Wander This World constantly... this is NOT Jonny Lang. What a waste of money this CD is. I don't understand why Jonny moved off the formula that made him successful - drivin' blues and great guitar work. This CD has neither. On his first two albums, virtually very song was good - and there were 4 or more great tunes on each. I don't like anything on this latest effort. Take my word - if you are a blues fan - you will not like this."
2,"DISAPPOINTMENT -- Michael from Tacoma, WA","A big disappointment if you are looking for blues. I saw him live with Buddy Guy and expected more outstanding blues like Lie To Me. It's his right to change his style as an artist. I just wish I had known that before buying the CD and would not have gotten it. If you aren't expecting blues, give it a try and decide for yourself. Recommend Ronnie Earl ""I Feel Like Goin' On"" instead which I just got."
2,Long Time Coming,"Wow....this was a surprise. A lot of different styles can be found here, but most don't resemble the styles that got Jonny Lang to this point.""Living for the City"" is a great cover, and Jonny pulls it off great. ""Give Me Up Again"" borrows the verse melody from Van Morrison's ""Crazy Love"", then transitions into a Nickelback type arena rock verse. ""Red Light"" has kind of offbeat reggae feel...etc.I liked ""Lie to Me"". I still play ""Wander This World"". They say that the great players return their blues roots after going astray. I hope so."
1,Will the REAL Jonny please come back!,"Jonny boy you were amazing! Keyword there: were. Jonny's previous albums were hot and full of talent and knowledge of the blues. Then comes this album. Why the mainstream switch?? Where did that firey blues guitarist I once knew go? For being a completely mainstream pop album, it's good. But this is *not* Jonny Lang. You want some REAL Jonny, check out ""Lie To Me."" For this new album, there is only *one,* I repeat one, blues song which is the title track, ""Long time coming."" Coinscedence? I think not. PLEASE Jonny, I am happy for you in the fact that you're happily married, but you're music was much better off feelin' the blues, man! Don't make the same mistake on the next album!"
1,I Can't Believe It's Jonny Lang!!,"I've been a long time fan of Jonny Lang. Lie To Me, Wander This World, and Kid Jonny Lang & The big Band Smokin, were joys to listen to. He really could get down and nasty with the Blues. It seems that he has lost his way now. Long Time Coming is nothing like what I came to love and expect from such a great singer and guitar slinger as Jonny. What happened??"
2,Not quite long enough?,"I was so excited waiting for this CD and felt a huge letdown when I first played it. I have listened to it at least 50 times hoping that it would grow on me. Nope. I was feeling pretty bummed because I had purchased tickets for myself and some friends for his concert at the Orpheum in Madison. Having praised him so much, I thought the concert would embarrass me and my musical tastes. Wrong. The concert was excellent, including the new stuff. Jonny needs to take another look at his production team because they did him a grave injustice on this CD."
2,Disappointed,"Jonny Lang has a real feel for the blues, and his blues vocals are among the best you're likely to hear anywhere. Sadly, he's left the blues behind on this release. If I wanted Pop, I'd have bought some Michael Jackson. I hear a little of the old Jonny on the first number ""Give Me Up Again,"" along with some good guitar riffs and I really like ""Red Light"" for some unknown reason. :) His cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Livin In The City"" shows once again how strong this young man's vocals can be.All in all, though, three songs do not an album make . . . the rest of the recording is eminently forgettable. I hope he comes home some day."
1,McAlbum,"Disappointing. It's good to see artists branch out of their pigeonholes, but this is just flat-sounding and uninteresting music custom made for bad radio stations. Even as a plain rock 'n roll record it's poor and doesn't showcase Lang's strong voice or guitar skills. Lang's earlier records made me say ""wow,"" this one makes me say ""blah."""
1,Not long enough,"The former blues prodigy has gone pop. Save your money, buy Michael Bolton garbage instead. What were his handlers thinking? Trying to broaden his appeal by departing from the blues is not a good career move. The music industry already is full of mindless drivel, who needs another Justin Timberlake?"
1,Very Disappointed,"I am a huge Jonny Lang fan and bought this CD sight unseen because his others are great. But this is the most disappointed I've been with buying a CD at full price, in a long time. His singing reminds me of a poor cross with Joe Cocker and James Taylor. And there are no signs of the Blues Master that Jonny has shown previously. He won't last long with this music, as anybody can sing it. Don't buy this CD."
2,San Jose - You Didn't See Anything,"""I saw this change coming from 7 miles away..."" Oh, please. I doubt it.The release of ""Wander This World"" after the successful ""Lie to Me"" garnered very few complaints. There were some great rock and blues tracks - Still Raining, The Levee, Cherry Red Wine, as well as acoustic ballads - Breakin' Me, Walking Away.This new album is a severe departure to largely pop music. Don't tell Jonny's fans what to like. We know it when we hear it. 2 stars - at most."
1,Where did Jonny go?,"This album is crap, almost threw it out the window on the way home! I don't know where Jonny is going with his music, but it is definately in the WRONG direction! Get back to playin the BLUES Jonny!!"
5,THE BEST CD!!!!!,"this is the BEST CD! He's the best singer, and his music is simple but it's still really dramatic and really hooky. This is the best CD, and I listen to it everyday"
4,great cd,"This is yet another great CD from the man, Jonny Lang. I would have liked more rock instead of the slow stuff. Overall, great CD!"
5,different but very good,Ok all you guys obviously didnt even give this cd a chance! I thought it was weird the first time I listened to it. But the one song that really hit me was Red Light it was so moving because it was meaning so many different things. All the songs are awesome but that was was great. I agree that it is something different a little bit slower but its also talking about his wife and most of the songs are about love and he life and its very awesome so all you guys that gave it a low score need to listen to the cd a few more times!
1,We could have waited longer,"After being totally awed by Jonny's first 2 albums, Our expectations were quite higher for this one. Generally musicians raise the notch as they atain more experience. Perhaps it's just that it all sounds uninspired, or perhaps he has decided to completely change his style. The high points were the opening for track 11(Happiness & Misery) & the remake of (Livin' for the City)"
3,A decent album,Long time coming is of the average records from Jonny.Though the this album has some great songs but is a bit dissapointing as a whole.
3,It's very simple,"Like so many young blues players, Jonny apparently found the blues too limiting, so he expanded his sound. He wrote most of the songs. If you want the blues, even ""rockin' blues"" like his early stuff, this album is definitely not for you. A bit of blues influence, a bit of soul, a bit of R&B, orchestral arrangements... it's rock. And it's well done... if that's what you're looking for."
2,"Where's the Blues, Dude????","I really wanted to like this album -- and I've been waiting a long time for it. I loved Jonny's first two album, saw him in concert and think he's a great BLUES talent. Unfortunately, this is NOT a BLUES CD. It sounds like Jonny's been listening to too much 70's rock and roll. There's nothing new here -- and worst of all there's NO BLUES. Now, excuse me while I quickly put on some blues to wash away the stuff I just listened to."
2,Where'd Jonny go?,"I was very excited to hear Jonny was FINALLY releasing a new cd. But, this is not the Jonny Lang that had such a bold, raspy voiced, rockin' blues sound that we all loved to listen to. Plus, I have not seen anything about why it took him so long to release a new cd, and why the change in style. Inquiring minds want to know. Actually, I was waiting to hear this cd before deciding to go to the concert coming up soon. I have decided not to go. All musicians have a right to change. I just wish I could get into this change."
2,don't bother,"anyone who gives a low rating to this album because it isn't blues is missing the point, which is that with the exception of ""red light,"" the songwriting is mediocre at best. i don't mind lang venturing into rhythm and blues, but this isn't rhythm and blues...this is pure, silly pop, and he doesn't even redeem it with compelling guitar playing. the gutsy quality in lang's voice that shone forth on lie to me is also gone. he's not a singer, he's a shouter, and when he tries a more polished vocal style, it comes off an anemic. jonny be good, but this be bad."
2,Crying the Blues for the old Jonny Lang.,"What a shame...I saw Jonny Lang for the first time five years ago when he played at one of the outdoor concerts at the Seattle water front, and fell in love with his music. Went to see him again last night at the Paramount and couldn't be more dissapointed in his new stuff. Not since Stevie Ray Vaughn has there been such a great blues guitar player with a voice to match. Not even a hint of the blues in his new CD. This one was put out with NO meat...only the bread and the cheese which makes it very empty. Red Light is really the only song worth listening to more than once. Hoping this was just an experiment, and that the Jonny Lang we all fell in love with returns next time with the MEAT!"
2,"Admire the talent, but still not for me","Jonny Lang is an amazing talent. He's got great vocals, great tone and technique, and he's got soul. However, in spite of all that, the arrangements and the lyrics on ""Long Time Coming"" leave me flat and, frankly, bored. There are a lot of other people out there producing this same type of material and sound in just about every genre played on the radio these days. It's getting pretty homogenous out there and this album slips right into a state of mediocrity. So, for me, this effort simply doesn't work...which is too bad. I like Jonny Lang."
2,Not What I Was Expecting....,I have to admit that I'm disappointed with the change of style on this CD. I was looking forward to another album that had great guitar solos and lyrics that had a hint of the blues. This CD doen't come anywhere near those things. It is very 'sappy' and 'pop-ish'. I don't recommend buying this CD if you're hoping that it will be like the pervious ones.
2,Not SRV - AT ALL!,"Oh man did I get burned!I read a review of this album in People magazine where Jonny Lang was being compared to Stevie Ray Vaughan. This immediately grabbed my interest as I can think of nothing better than SRV. There was even mention of a Steven Tyler harmonica accompanyment. All of this added up to my immediate purchase of the album ""Long Time Coming"". Simply put, THIS IS NOT BLUES.I am still angry, not so much at Lang, but at the magazine review.Lang's album has clearly departed from the blues genre and delved straight into mainstream rock-pop. If you are looking for the second coming of SRV, this is not it.I was very impressed with Lang's early stuff (lie to me) and listening to this album, I did not hear much, if any growth in his lyrics or vocal ability. I guess he did set the bar pretty high for himself as a 16 year old phenom. Unless you really like Jonny's vocals, I would not reccommend this album. If you're looking for blues - run the other way!"
1,Aagh,"What a terrible turn for this previously great blues guy. Such a great voice, great guitar skills, But what poorly written, over-produced songs on this CD. Not a shred of the blues, no matter where you listen. Not even a cross-over attempt. I'm not sure what he was attempting, except to write his own songs, to much regret by this previously rabid ran. I haven't seen a meltdown like this since Tower of Power. Schade."
3,Oh dear!,"This slick production sounds like mush to my ears.I loved ""Lie To Me"", and ""Wander This World"", but the things I liked were Jonny's amazing throaty voice, strong songs, and his economical but eloquent guitar work, great tone and uncluttered simplicity. Here he retains his great voice and economical guitar work, but the songs are such a disapointment- instantly forgettable. The heavily processed sound hides the individual instruments in a sea of mediocrity which could be any one of a hundred wannabe artists. His tone sucks, or maybe you just can't hear it ,hidden in the mush. He certainly holds back.I understand that blues has a relatively small audience compared to pop/rock but he stood out as a major talent as a bluesman and it seems a shame not to hear him express more eloquent statements of the human condition than this rubbish.Long time coming? Maybe Jonny thought about this too much, and should have just shot from the hip."
2,dang jonny lang.,"he's got the best voice in the blues which is pretty amazing for a young, white guy. he can also throw down on guitar when he wants to. so i was hoping the new record would be along those lines -- raw, bluesy and passionate. forget about it. this album sounds more like michael bolton had a baby with r. kelly. it's very easy listening-ish but really, very hard for me to listen to."
2,"Oh no, no, no","This album is not my cup of tea in the least bit. I was utterly dissapointed when I popped it (fresh from the case) into my stereo and heard the ...stuff coming out of it. If youre a hardcore fan or someone who enjoys modern-streamline pop, go ahead and spend the money; if you're like me (who enjoyed his early, renowned blues work), go out and pick up some Stevie Ray Vaughn and stay far, far away from this mess."
2,Long time fan disappointed,"This album was a supreme disappointment to this long time fan. I used a song from ""Lie To Me"" as my wedding song (When I Come to You). I was pleasantly surprised at the diversity of ""Wander This World"" which was more rock than blues. Consistent on all the albums was his style as a guitar player which only got better and better.""Long Time Coming"" feels like record company manuvering gone awry. It doesn't have much blues save for a couple of songs, (both covers) - the title song and ""Dying to Live"" which was unfortunately ""popped up"" with synthetic drums courtesy of Eminem. I heard ""Red Light"", ""Give Me Up Again"" and ""Get What You Give"" in 2 JL concerts and loved them live, but the album versions feel artificial because the soulful guitar playing is noticably absent.I can understand a musician evolving, this is a step down, not nearly good R&B, but passable pop. The cover of ""Living for the City"" just sucks, plain and simple."
1,jonny slips away,"Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for ""Give me up again"", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD ""Crossroads Festival"". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues."
3,What happened?,"I purchased this cd hoping for the same level of enthusiam Jonny generated in ""Lie to Me"" and ""I Wander This World"" and am really diappointed. What happened? It's almost as if he longed to join the ranks of the boy bands. Everyone is entitled to try something new, but it's a shame to mess around with a winning sound. If you liked ""Lie to Me' and ""I Wander This World"", you might want to pass on this one."
1,not a blues cd,"Jonny Lang has definately sold out big time with this album. It's nothing like his earlier works, mainly because he doesn't play his guitar hardly at all, which was his signature thing. The album comes across as a John Mayer want-to-be, and a poor one at best. There are only two songs on the album that I would consider DECENT. And I am (was) a huge fan of his. Most of the songs are a bunch of worthless crap that sound the same - a desperate attempt to sneak into the mainstream. No elements of the blues on this album whatsoever. Has Jonny forgotten what made him famous to begin with? Don't waste your money on this - you could probably find someone who is willing to give you their copy for free."
5,Best album yet!,"This is personally my favorite of his albums! Touch, Red light and Dying to Live are so deep and beautiful! I hope everyone listens to it in spite of... less than perfect reviews, and loves it as much as I do!! Keep then coming Jon! It's beautiful!"
1,"""long time coming"" should have been postponed","The only thing blue-see about this CD is the mood I hadafter dropping $10. for it.Johnny, please send an apology and the $10 back for it.As soon as I put it in the player, a befuddled look appeared onmy face and I asked myself ""what the He** was this crap"" Johnny is trying to pass off as music. Johnny, maybe the backseat boys would like to reform and you can play lead!Really dissapointing after the previous releases.""Long time coming"" maybe should have waited a bit and remixedthe tracks with a blues feel."
5,Great album,"I think this album really showed that Jon was capable of so much more than bubble gum blues. It still kicks butt, but with a little more emotion and meaning behind it. Great album and if you;re a Lang lover you should have em all anyway!"
5,Great CD,Jonny Lang is an amazing blues guitarist and this CD delivers. I personnaly love his earlier stuff best but songs like Red Light on this CD keep me happy. Any lover of guitar or someone in love with or curious about the blues should gives this CD a shot!
5,LOVE IT,I love it! I love Jonny Lang have since he started at the ripe ol' age of 14! He's amazing....its about time for a new album and I love it! Must Have!
5,Johnny Lang has found himself,"Here on Johnny Lang's latest album we experience the contemporary sound of the blues. Where we found Johnny shifting between classic covers, takes on Eric Clapton solos and Stevie Ray Vaughn fire-breathing riffs in his previous albums we now meet someone who's found HIS sound. What's most impressive is how his voice has matured and emotion is felt from the 2nd track Red Light, on through Long Time Coming where he breaks out the steel string resonator and puts and pulls an urban tone out of a rural guitar. Great listening, keeping this one in my CD player for many-a-day."
5,New Directions are good!,"Well Jonny has definitely stepped a little out of his blues shoes but he still is phenomenal. I love this album--the soul and rock feel is awesome. The hooks are just great! This effort was a long time coming but in my opinion it was well worth it. He has matured in a new direction and it suits him well. His voice is very strong and he seems to be even more comfortable with his falsetto, which is extremely similar to Prince. I look forward to watching his career catch on fire in the months to come."
1,This CD sucks!,"Take all you know about Jonny Lang ~ the killer biting guitar licks, the strong vocals, the blues based CD's he's done in the past and throw it all away. Lang's attempt at performing sapping pop tunes will really go well with those who like the Patridge Family. What a MAJOR disappointment this CD is! I am really bummed I bought this CD and wish I had listened to it first as I would not take it if it were free. Jonny ~ go back to blues, you're a star there. This doesn't even rate! Some of the worst songs you'll ever hear, his vocals aren't up to par, and the music lends itself to an overproduced lack luster performance (and that's on the POSITIVE side!)."
2,American Idol wanna be,"Jonny Lang sounds more like an American Idol wanna be than the great blues singer that he was. I gave the CD two stars because Red Light is a good song. As for the rest of it, Jonny owes me $15"
2,Long Time Coming . Jonny Lang,This is buy far the worst CD I've bought. in a long time.His 1st CD was great. 2nd CD was ok. Johnny has went so far from his Blues roots with this CD.Why Cant artist figure out what works and leave the rest of this Crap alone.
5,Great Album,This is a great album. I love every song on it. I have listened to this album many times now and I never get tired of listening to it. I would highly recommend this album.
2,Jonny lost the blues,I was a little disappointed with the album and do not like the new type of music he is playing (more soul influence than blues). His last two albums were great but I do not blindly follow his stuff and think it is great...especially when it is not.
2,Lyrics are weak,I don't mind the change in sound on this album. I think the music is pretty good but the lyrics are weak. Bring back Bruce McCabe!
1,IT SUCKS,"If you liked Jonny Langs first 2 CDS dont assume you'll like this one.He leaves the Blues for a more produced and pop sound to try and reach a larger fan base. FOR MORE MONEY,MONEY ,MONEY.I dont like it, IT SUCKS!"
2,He should have stopped at the Red Light,"On an interview Lang said he almost did not record Red Light- he didn't think it really fit his style. Well- it's a good song, unlike the rest of this albumn unfortunately. In the interview he also said he was growing and exploring new directions and was happy. Well that's wonderful that he's happy but unfortunately his new direction really wastes his talents. Maybe he needs to get unhappy so he can play the blues he was meant to play."
2,Damn Disappointed,"Jonny what happened brother? Take stock, get some good material, and come back. We're waiting for you, don't let us down."
3,Unusual Jonny,This CD is not the worst I heard nor the best I have ever heard. Jonny is best suited to his fans playing and singing the blues. Which is not done on this CD. Jonny moved more into a mainstream rock rhythm with this CD. The songs aren't bad just not what you expect from Jonny Lang. I wouldn't throw this CD away like some others have claimed. But I would put it way down on my playlist. Not a CD that you want to play over and over again. Maybe a few times a month.
2,Sorry,"I had heard that this new Jonny Lang release was different--not so much blues and more rock, innovative. I love that artists are willing to reach out and experiment. However, I just can't get into this one. It has no appeal whatsoever....but I'll give the next one a try still as I am definitely a fan of Jonny's original sound !"
4,New sound still outstanding,"I loved Jonny's previous album so I was a bit surprised when I heard the different sounds on this disc. But I love it. It's rock with R&B edge and his vocals are better than ever. There's still enough of the amazing guitar he's so famous for to keep die hards happy. Excellent work, Mr. Lang!"
1,Disappointed,"I loved Jonny's first three albums and was really looking forward to this one. His blues guitar and singing were getting better and better and I thought this next album would be at least on a par with his others. But I didn't expect such a dramatic shift away from the Blues. I was very disappointed. This was overproduced and unimaginative. Go back to the Blues, Jonny. This type of music ain't your style. Leave it to the Manilows and Kenny G's of this world. Go back to the Blues, Jonny!"
1,Where's Jonny,"very disappointing after waiting all this time, there's nothing here special & the blues you may have been expecting is sadly missing. Save your bucks buy another of your favorite blues artists, hope Jonny shows up next time."
1,Syruppy-sweet fluff,"I will have to agree with the others here that were very disappointed with this release. This collection of meaningless Pop fluff has no heart and no soul. I bought this CD based entirely on my knowledge of his sound from ""Lie To Me"" and ""Wonder This World"". I'm not really sure that this CD was made by the same person! Light-weight ballads and weak attempts at R&B.One thing is for sure! This will not wind up in my Blues collection. I'm giving it to my daughters and they can listen to it along with the likes of Britney and Christina and Aaron Carter."
4,Long Time Coming,"I saw Jonny Lang in concert in August of 2000 and it was one of the best shows I have seen(Buddy Guy and Kenny Wayne Shepherd with BB KIng are two others). Jonny talked about having his new album out soon and I have been waiting patiently ever since. Three years later and it is finally in my hands.......... Was it worth the wait?Yes, definitely. Its nice that Jonny doesn't sound like every one else thats on the radio today.His own style is showing in the songs he has written for the cd.If you are looking for a straight up blues album this may not be the CD for you but if you enjoy good music that runs the gamut from blues to soul to rock then I would definitely recomend ""Long Time Coming"".Its a very solid album from one of the best guitar players out there."
1,Jonny Lang Long Time Coming,"Long Time Coming, a short time going. Jonny Lang has left the building, and with him went the best 'new' blues man with the 'oldest' blues voice around. This was a BIG disappoinment for me, I have always loved 'the boy's' music, now he is just your tipical soft rocker with no style,.YUK!I miss the old Jonny, Jonny come back to the blues for dedicated blues fans like me, you lost me....Moonlover"
1,Will someone please sing the Blues?,"Dont LIE TO ME Jonny you sold out for more money.I dont want to hear this crap!This formula stuff doesnt stick, you hear it a coupleof times and you dont want to play it any more.These pop song's are weak.Jonny you are very talented and I LOVE your live showswith all your passion and energy.PLEASE go back to the BLUES for us as well as for yourself."
2,Great Disappointment,I LOVE Jonny Lang. Couldn't wait to listen to this album. It was a complete disappointment. Love him for what I've heard in the past. this is nothing like it. Plan on seeing him in March at the Troubadour. Hope he plays his old stuff.....
1,Jonny's Gone Pop,"JL needed to print a warning label on this release that read ""WARNING: IF YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING JONNY LANG THE BLUESMAN, HE'S LEFT AND GONE POP."" If it had, I wouldn't have wasted my money. With the exception of his Stevie Wonder cover, I could have been listening to Justin Timberlake, the Carter Boys and a whole host of Teeny Bopper favorites. And this was the kid they let record a track on ""Blues Brothers 2000""?! Long time coming to this, huh? Maybe the title should have read ""Gone Commercial""."
1,Save your money,"I was a big fan of Jonny Lang - someone under 65 who sang the blues, and jammed at that! - until this album. Like a few recent reviewers have written, Whoa, Jonny should have waited another five years and cut an album that was true to sound that got him a record deal in the first place.Very disappointing effort. Hopefully, this is just a mistaken detour, and not a dead-end to Lang's otherwise promising talent."
1,"Long time coming, short time listening","In this year of 2003, the year Congress has declared ""the year of the blues"", Jonny Lang (one of recent years' torchbearers of the blues) has done a lousy job of honoring his musical roots with this album. I love his first two albums, but this one is a huge disappointment--hardly any blues influences at all. In the credits he thanks Hanson. For what? influencing his music? It sounds like they have. Most of the songs here are just pop fluff, and his guitar playing, which was so remarkable on his first album, takes a big backseat.I just hope that Kenny Wayne Shepherd doesn't jump on the pop sell-out bandwagon with HIS next album (if it ever comes out)."
1,Jonny where is all the blues songs you used to play,This is one of the worst cds i have ever heard by jonny lang. Where are all the back up singers? Where are all the blues songs he used to wright? THIS CD SUCKS!!!!! THAT WAS THE BIGGIST WAST OF MONEY IF YOU ARE SMART LIKE MANY OF US THAT HATE THIS CD YOU WILL NOT WAST YOUR MONEY
5,Great album...in it's own right!,"As a fan of Jonny Lang since his days with The Big Bang, I can unequivocably state that I love his new album. I loved Jonny and his ability to sing the blues, however I always felt that this was limiting this immensely talented soul. I felt he had more to say and his tag as a ""blues"" artist limited who he could say it to.This album finds Jonny exploring more of his R&B/Rock side with limited excursions into what I would call the blues. As a fan of his earlier songs such as Wander this World, Lie to Me, and Breakin' Me, people shouldn't find this as much of a surprise as his earlier albums, sans ""Smokin"", often contained these crossover songs. The thing that is different is this one reverses the ratio. More rock/R&B, less ""blues"". From the immediately likeable ""Red Light"" to the Prince influenced ""Beautiful One"", I can listen to this one from top to bottom without skipping any of them.If you are a fan of Storyville, Ian Moore, Joe Bonamassa, you'll love this album."
5,Walking a red light.......,"This is a rock and roll album. This is a fabulous rock and roll album. It's a wonderful walk through the red light....I love Jonny's voice...it sounds like he is stuggling at times to get the words out but it is just his throaty-ness and his wave. Every song has redeeming qualities whether it is sweet and soft or wild and rockin'.... I am so impressed, I can hardly stand myself......Jonny, I am going to keep you around......I have a feeling you know what you're doing........"
4,Making A Genre-Crossing Transition,"It has been a long time waiting for the original young man with a guitar to return to the music scene. He has shed his original blues skin, and created a genre-blending CD. With guitar in hand and the roughened vocals of a man who has lived life, Jonny Lang delivers a wonderful album filled with sing-along tunes about heartbreak and hard times.Jonny Lang fits perfectly into the molds created by the Michael McDonald and Justin Timberlake-types. His album has the pop-rock tracks that will surely hit heavy rotation on Top 40 radios, but he also features songs with the old soul/R&B feel of early Al Green and Stevie Wonder. With his strong vocals and co-writing skills, Jonny Lang puts his heart into every song and it shows by making the simplest lyrics sound profound. A Long Time Coming is not a blues album, but it is still worth a listen."
4,Worth the wait.......,"I, like many others, expected a more blues driven album, however I am pleasantly supprised. The album veers from Lang's prior musical path, but displays his talent and versitlity as a musician and songwriter. The album is pretty laid back for the most part and is very enjoyable. I recommend giving it a listen."
4,Great CD!,"I actually had never heard of Johnny Lang until my sister bought my dad this CD. Johnny is a great singer! I think ""Red Light"" is the best, and the lyrics are especially great, but they are all great songs. My dad listens to this CD constantly in the car and we both love it!"
2,"Way Too ""Justified""","Look, if I wanted to listen to Justin Timberlake I would've bought HIS album, and trust me, that won't happen! I can't tell you how excited I was to hear Jonny's new album. I rushed to buy it, only to hear the ""nails-down-the-chalkboard"" sound of really insipid, poppy, fluff. ""Long Time Coming"" has a total lack of substance, force, and the staying power that his first album had.I'm thinking someone should get rid of the guys who produced the crap out of these songs and let Jonny go back to doing what he does best, playing the kind of music that possesses you to make the same faces Jonny does when he's playing the guitar, and you're just listening! I only hope his next album has more of the no-fluff style that we've been enjoying with past albums, or at least less-fluff than this one."
2,the Cat Has Chops but this ain't it,"I was digging Johnny Lang's vibe when he first came out&then I could tell the Record Company's started messing up his Groove because His 2nd Album was Suffering from someone trying so hard to Cross Him over.this Set is more in that direction.Johnny Can groove on a Guitar but this doesn't seem like Him all the way.""Living for the City"" take was cool.but this Album feels like someone else was pulling the strings in the end."
3,Different but good,"This CD is very different compared to his first 3 releases. If you are expecting to find another Jonny ""bluesy /funk /R&B"" styled CD, this isnt it. However it is a differnt kind of good, in its own right. The songs are milder with a little more melodic soul that leaves you hanging on wanting Jonny to kick in and showcase the throaty, guitar talents that he is known for but it doesn't happen on here. If you can appreciate the CD for what it is (different & milder than the first 3) and remember that it's progressive side of Jonny's style, that you gonna like it."
1,keep waiting,"I've certainly been waiting for a new Jonny Lang album. I love his hard blues guitar style. Sadly, it is nowhere to be found on this album. Instead, a sappy collection of pop love songs, featuring Lang's voice rather than his guitar. Does he think people bought his albums for his voice?Not recommended for blues lovers. However, if you like soft R&B Pop, this one's for you."
4,lang,A wonderful cd by a great artist. Pure and simple; it's good music. I highly recommend this album.
1,Justin Timberlake could have done better,"This album is simply terrible. I cannot express my disappointment. 4 long years have passed and this is what we get. The problem is clearly that Jonny has decided to write the entire record himself, and as one can see, he is just simply a terrible song writer. Jonny, I will continue to listen to your previous albums and respect you to the fullest due to the fact that those records were fabulous, and i shall pretend like this CD never ever came out.P.S : Please PLEASE, let other people write the songs."
2,where has the guitar genius gone?,if you are looking for that amazing kid who played the guitar blues you've come to the wrong place - Jonny was never a great singer but he had the music working with him - 'school girl' my favorite is an excellant example - I know you have to grow but he should stick closer to what he is great at - this cd (even after listening to it several times): too much singing not enough guitar music
2,"Weak, weak, weak","I'm a huge Jonny Lang fan, but this one doesn't make the grade. After five years without a release, you'd think Jonny would have put together a dozen better songs than are on this disc. Maybe getting married and finding Jesus damaged his creative impulse, who knows. But these are just unmemorable bland songs that Jonny tries to pep up with some manufactured ""soulful"" singing. I listened to it three times in an evening and afterwards I couldn't name one song or hum one melody. Just boring."
2,Oh NO,Jonny JONNY JONNY where are the blues at brother?I was so looking forward to another great CD but instead I get your'e Justin Timberlake imitation. Don't waste your'e bucks on this CD!That said I still think you have the best voice of all the young guns and hope this is just a faze. Please put your'e effort into the blues.
3,Far from his best..,"I took the time to read the reviews before getting this new release from a truly gifted guitar player and the reviews are right.. he left the 'Lie To Me' sound behind and ventured down another path and result is only fair at best.. The good Lord knows that I wish I had Jonny's talent, but this CD will probably end up gathering dust.. If you truly want to hear a guitar great that has released something that was a long time coming and worth the wait.. try Jeff Healey - Get Me Some.. a totally different style and being an import - it'll cost you twice as much but I believe you will definately play it twice as often if not more.."
1,"Jonny, stick with what you can do!!!","Jonny Lang has incredible talent, however this last CD, shows absolutely none whatsoever. It sounds like a hybrid between the Backstreet Boys and John Mare. Please Jonny, before you release something that is a ""Long Time Coming"" think of the fans you are going to lose with this crap. I respect your old talent, but it will take a lot more change for me to become a fan again."
2,"Not Blues, Not Blues, Not At All Blues","Don't buy this CD if you want to hear Jonny Lang play the blues.This is pop, pure and simple. Yet he continues to be marketed in the blues genre. It's a pleasant enough recording, but given Jonny's ""stature"" I expected so much more after 5 years without a release. It is a disgrace to the blues, though, to have these types of recordings thrown into the category."
2,What happened?,"As others, I waited and waited for this CD to come out. I have every CD Jonny's ever made - even the ones where he's just featured such as when he plays ""Midnight Train"" with Buddy Guy on his CD. Needless to say, this CD disappoints. Other than the first song and maybe one other I have found myself jumping from track to track looking for a song that doesn't sound like 'N Sync or Prince. Jonny - come back to the blues!"
5,Two Types Of Jonny Lang Fans,"If you expect Jonny to never change from the 15 year old kid he was when he first started recording, then do not buy this cd. He is married and 21 now, I believe, and his music has matured along with him. This is an outstanding, eclectic cd. A liitle of everything, and Jonny's vocals have grown from his trademark growl to just an all-around outstanding voice that can hit anything. I love the songwritingon this cd and the songs as well. Like I said, if you want nothing but old Jonny Lang, then don't buy the new Jonny Lang, he recorded the other stuff over 5 years ago."
2,"A new direction, but not to my taste","Ordered this new album long in advance of the release, this on the assumption that it would be a further step in the blues-rock direction established through his first two major releases. I understand from some J. Lang interviews that the material here is more of his own original work, which I respect and admire in terms of artistic growth and courage, but just don't care for musically nearly as much as I did his earlier work. Saw Lang on his tour this summer and it was a stunning performance. Hope he does not lose too much of that audience with this new sound, or that he finds others who like it as much as I liked the old sound. Whatever, make a point of listening to the song samples before you buy, because if you're a big fan of the earlier work, this new album is definitely not more of the same."
2,To The Bargain Bin,"As some have said, if you like any of his early work then DO NOT buy this disc. He has gone from blues guitar phenom to R&B to a mishmash of style. I have no problem with change but the quality just isn't on this one. I bought it early without benefit of any reviews. I tried listening to it for several weeks but it never grabbed me at all- no soul or grit. I'll have to hear something better before buying Jonny disc again."
2,Jonny Lame,"Disappointing effort by comparison to his first release.I couldn't appreciate the Hip-Hop beats, especially on Edgar Winter's ""Dying to Live""."
4,goodbye blues,"i do miss the blues, i mean its good for what its supposed to be, but i am sure i am not his only fan who would love to see him sing the blues again, he has an incredible gift. this album lacks the same feeling, the same soul, that the previous ones had."
4,great cd...,"i really like this cd...he is very talented and this cd truelyshows it...my fav song on the cd is prolly red light...also for the person who mentioned the eminem drum programming on Dying To Live...the song was originally sung by Edgar Winter...and Eminem used the sample for the new TuPac & BIG song ""Runnin"", which samples the piano and chorus of the song...the drum pattern for Jonny's and TuPac's are the exact same...i happen to think its very cool."
1,Bummer,"I too ran out and bought this CD immediately. Jonny, you were born to sing the blues. I'm sure he'll look back on this mistake in the future and I'll buy some of his future releases. I waited a long time for this one, but the thing really sucks and isn't Jonny Lang. Oh well, we all make mistakes and I'm sure he'll make up for it with his blues talent."
1,Big Disappointment,"Jonny Lang's ""Lie To Me"" CD was excellent. This offering is at best, disappointing. The young man has far too much talent to put crap like this out. You would expect a CD like this from some shallow, individual with no soul looking for bucks. Jonny Lang - You need to go back to where you were coming from and alienate yourself from whoever talked you into to doing stuff like this!"
2,"Where's the Blues, Dude?????","I really wanted to like this album -- and I've been waiting a long time for it. I loved Jonny's first two album, saw him in concert and think he's a great BLUES talent. Unfortunately, this is NOT a BLUES CD. It sounds like Jonny's been listening to too much 70's rock and roll. There's nothing new here -- and worst of all there's NO BLUES. Now, excuse me while I quickly put on some blues to wash away the stuff I just listened to."
4,Common Guys,"Give the Jesus Loving Kid a break . To evolve you need to experiment and Go Forward . It's a great album form a great guitar player and singer . I quit expecting the Greatest Recording by any group a few years ago . It just a bad mental state to B in . Memory is all it takes . I appreciate what I get and look 4 the good side of Every recording I buy . Some miss the mark , like the Strokes , I had to give it away . This album is a Hanson meets Lang , and I really like Lang's work with Hanson . There , I said It . And yes , I was born in the 50's ..."
2,"...an' it's gonna be a long time gone, hopefully","John, at the behest of my daughter when she was first learning guitar (more then 10 years ago, really), I listened to your...product. And I said one word: BLAND. But when I saw you in the ""Blues Brothers 2000"" faux pas (to put it kindly), all I could think was maybe you were ""a good boy"" one year, and Santa Claus brought you a ""Les Paul knock-off."" Go back and learn your plumbing skills, dude, you have nothing to say."
4,Solid,"...but not exciting. I have seen Squeeze several times and a great concert with GT and the Fluffers and they were more fired up on those occasions than they are in this video. But even a mediocre performance is better than a show by most artists. Good set list, too."
1,Not good enough,This selfpaced training is one of the worst Microsoft has produced so far. The only one that i can think of that is worse is the selfpaced training kit for IEAK 4. If you have bought it and are preparing for the MCP test. I advice you to read the chapters in the Windows 2000 Srv RK on the subjects for the test. Also be sure to download some whitepapers from Microsoft. The book alone just don't prepare you good enough for the test.
1,The Paradox,"This book and the exam don't match up at all. Though this book is written in a fairly superficial way the test itself asked very obtuse questions. As such the test taker is left in a gap as to how to gain the knowledge to demonstrate mastery on the exam. I still don't know one achieves this goal??? and this is coming from someone who has an mcse + I, CCNP, and CCDP and has worked extensivly in the website deployments with w2k for about a year. So congratulations if you have passed the exam, and if you haven't I would wait till the texts and exams meet up sometime in the next couple months!!"
1,Great for starting out for the MCSE,I like this book because it helped alot in working with Windows 200. Not only getting you ready for the MCSE portion of the test. I recommend it to those who are getting ready to take the MCSE exams.
4,Fly on Thunderbird Fly.........,"RIP Kevin, I always thought you were a great rocker, and now you can join Randy and play the old songs. ""Cheese"" metal was always one of my weaknesses and you did it great. I missed a lot of good albums by you guys in the past 10 years or so, so it's sort of ironic I just picked up ""Alive and Well"", even though I know your not. At least the music will live on."
1,Worst QR album,"I LOVE QR. They were the band that brought me into Metal.For Live performances, the original lineup was nearly unbeatable...saw them in 1999 in Pueblo when they toured with Slaughter and Nugent.I loved their other albums in recent years.This one was utterly flat and uninspired. It lacked the energy and drive of previous works, almost formulaic.It hurts to write this, as Mr. Dubrow will never be able to make another album to make up for this one. He had a stellar career if you judge it by the quality of his work, regardless of how QR did or did not do in the charts.Rehab sounds like it was recorded by Musicians in need of rehab. of course, this was done after Mr. Cavazos and Sarzos left the band...so it's hard to figure out what part of the normal formula went wrong.Sorry folks, but this QR fan was sadly disappointed."
3,"Ignore this rating, 1000 CD set is a hell of a deal.","Ignore the rating. The ""details"" say this release consists of ""1000"" CDs. Amazon, please correct this obvious error."
1,Let the buyer beware,"The Free-Energy Device Handbook is less a handbook for the would be inventor and more a collection of various ideas, patents and whatever else the author could use to fill this 'book.' Inside you will find some theory, historical oddities and many re-printed magazine articles. There are a few designs for devices included but don't expect any kind of instructions, I didn't see any. The cost of return shipping requires keeping this book, it was cheep but why spend more? My advice is this: keep looking for better references and use your own ideas, there aren't any in here!"
2,The web rules!,"If you have web access, and who doesn't nowadays, this book will be old hat. Everything discussed in this book and more is available on the web, so, unless you want it for your collection it is not a ""must-have""."
3,It's more of a incomplete scrap book.,"This scrap book has a few inventions & details of the inventions and give a rough explanation of the inventions. If your an inventor &/are like my self, developing a form of contuing power, This book will teach you & warn you before you present your invention to the world. I cannot figure out why the guy used mercury in is genorator. Do me a favor people buy the book and mail me your theories. Thanks!"
1,Three simple words: Piece of trash!,Intelligent? This book is about as intelligent as 'The Celestine Prophecy' and shares the same literary quality
2,Amosan substitute-NOT,"I've used Amosan for 20+ years with great results. Vince does not work well at all in comparison. Yet when I search on the internet, Vince is the product that comes up. Just be aware, at least for me, Vince is not near as effective as Amosan."
5,Vince Mouth Care,This product is awesome!!! I have been using it since the 60's on the recommendation of my dentist. I've never had gum problems or root canals and I feel that it is because of using Vince on a regular basis.
3,Open package,"I love this product and it isn't really sold in stores anymore so I bought it online. I have brace and this helps maintain my mouth's health. BUT upon receiving it, I found that the product had no saftey seal which was very disappointing. It's too late to return it now."
5,Vince oral rinse,"This is incredible gum rinse. I remered it from my childhood. Fast shipping , thanks"
2,Poor Quality control,It did not last one day. Smear and line on new cartridge. The second one is working ok for now. Poor quality ..
1,LASER TONER CARTRIDGES,I PURCHASED TWO LASER TONER CARTRIDGES FOR A CANON PC745 COPIER. I HAD A PROBLEM WITH BOTH CARTRIDGES LEAVING A BLACK SMUG ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF COPIES. THE PRODUCT NUMBER FOR THESE CARTRIDGES WAS ST-E40 SHOWN AS REPLACE FOR THIS COPIER ON WEB SITE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE
1,WHAT A WASTE!,"After making about 60 good copies, the cartridge left an inch-wide gray streak down the middle of each copy. Just to make sure it was a problem with the new cartridge and not the copier, I inserted an old cartridge that had just a little ink left. The copies were fine. I reinserted the new cartridge, and sure enough, the wide streak returned. I contacted the seller - INK4WORK - and explained the problem. I received an email saying they would send a replacement. Three weeks have gone by and I have received nothing."
2,Not the deal you're looking for.,"Initially this seemed like a great deal. Unfortunately this cartridge didn't last half as long as other 3rd party cartridges I've used. It also started making an alarming clacking noise that had me looking through the copier with a flashlight. I thought my machine was broken! I'm going to go back to the other brand, if it works as well as I remember, I'll leave a positive review there."
4,This is a Deal!,"The price of this - under $20, is so much cheaper than anywhere else I can find. I was paying up to $80 for this reconditioned cartridge. So far it works just fine. I can tell I have to increase the darkness level already - so probably no as much 'ink' as the more expensive ones I have bought - but this one's less than $20! When this one dies - I'll go through Amazon and buy another."
1,Don't ever buy this!,"After I replace this cartridge to my copier, it keeps jamming the paper. I give up and buy another brand without any single problem! waste my money! dislike!!!"
1,Extraordinarily Poor Service,"When notified that one of the two cartridges ordered had broad stripes and the other poor contrast, grey blacks, Cartridge Warehouse responded promptly then went into shutdown dragging out my returns for months *NEVER* sending replacements. When pushed they then claimed that my return contained only one cartridge.For months I had to travel to Kinko's for copies, spent $9 to return their garbage product and had to engage Amazon for a refund. Thank you Amazon!I strongly recommend that you do not purchase from these people."
4,"Refilled Cartridge for Canon PC 160 from ""Inkers""","Fast ship by ""Inkers"". Packed very well. Installed in a breeze-it fit perfectly into my Canon PC 160. Just started using it (Dec 2010) and the copies look real nice.Too bad I cannot tell how long it will last and whether the copies will remain perfect but I have not owned this cartridge long enough to give it a real test.Let's hope it is a real winner! The service from ""Inkers"" was very good. I will review this again in about 4 or 5 months to let you know how it is performing."
5,Great watch for my son!,Watch came in good time and keeps even better time! Very happy with this purchase
2,Wish I had a Classic Custom 14 instead,"I received one of these a year ago for Xmas to replace an 18 yr old DLC7 (same as Cuisinart Custom 14). As everyone says, the features of this new model are great - much more convenient. HOWEVER... I now have to return it for warranty service because of NUMEROUS defects.There are cracks in both feed tubes, the lid, and one is starting on the bowl, all along stress points that didn't exist in the old model. Worse, the plastic coating over the soft touch buttons cracked and developed a large hole, so I've had to cover the buttons with tape to keep junk out of it. Since I have every confidence that these problems will return, be on the watch for a factory-reconditioned version for auction in the near future so I can get myself a Custom 14 :-)"
5,exceeding expcetations,It will do every thing i need it to do. though it was high in price but think it was well worth the what I paid for it.
2,buyer beware,"Cuisinart is supposed to be the top of the line. I got a 2014 14 cup processor and liked it until the tiny ""plastic"" part broke on the work bowl that engages the motor when clicked shut.To replace, you have to buy a whole new bowl for over $30. One would think a quality conscious company would not use so cheap a part. Look closely at it, because I'm sure it will break again in the future."
5,Great Food Processor,"With the dough mixing capability, you do not need a food mixer. This processor is a heavy duty all purpose device every working kitchen needs. The plastic parts are heavy duty and well designed with operator safety in mind and dish washer safe. I highly recommend buying the parts caddy to protect the sharp blades of the chopper and slicers. The only thing I would like to buy is a larger diameter veggie feeder top so I can slice larger tomatoes and onions."
2,julienne disc,"After purchasing the Power Prep Plus 14 cup I discovered they no longer make the 3x3 mm julienne disc, which is an accessory I desparately want. Cuisinsart told me I should buy a 12 cup model, after I just spent $300 on a 14 cup. If I had wanted a 12 cup model I would have bought that in the first place. They make julienne discs for both 12 and 20 cup but not the 14 cup. This is very frustrating."
5,Art History + License Bureau = Outstanding Debut Novel,"Wow! This book had much more substance than I'd imagined when I picked it up. April Henry delivers three areas of expertise - art history, WWII Germany, and working for the License Bureau for the state of Oregon. And somehow, she combines all three to make a very rich novel that made me want to read more of her books and learn more about the artist Vermeer. Any writer who can motivate a reader to look beyond their own words for more deserves an A+ in my book. This debut novel is OUTSTANDING!"
2,I've been manipulated!,"This book was an interesting trip into the world of cut throat (and I do mean cut throat) fine art. The facts about art, Vermeer (if true) and the Nazi art thefts are interesting and thought provoking. I'd rather learn about these things in this format than reading a dry text book. The downfall of this book is how manipulated I felt as a reader. I found myself reading a passage and thinking it was totally unnecessary. Then two pages later Claire (the main character) saves the day with something that was never talked about in the set up scene. Claire was also one of the least intellegent detectives I've ever encountered. If I walked into a ransacked appartment I'd call the police first thing! But hey thats me. The happy ending in which everybody (except Charlie) gets a reward also put me off. An adventurous read but I've had enough of Claire Montrose."
3,Not really a mystery,"Claire Montrose, has the very unique and intresting job of approving personalized license plates for the DMV in Oregon. Then one day, her Aunt dies and leaves everything to her. In the midst of a trailer full of junk, she finds a beautiful painting. On a whim, Claire decides to take a much needed vacation to New York City to find out if the painting is valuable. Once there, she meets two different men, both interested in her and her painting...I think Claire is a wonderful character, but I don't think this book deserves to be called a mystery book! When I read a mystery, I want lots of plot twists and more than one suspect to choose from. This simply read like regular fiction, no suspense at all. If you put that aside though, it's an ok read. Just don't expect a lot of suspense, as I did, or you will be disappointed."
4,Good Book,I rated this book at 4 stars because it was a little hard to follow at times and it took a few pages to connect the dots to determine what was going on. There was a lot of misdirection which helped to keep the interest and kept me turning the pages.
5,Great Author with Great Books,"I ordered and read all of her books - they are quick reads, enjoyable, and very entertaining."
1,An insipid mystery,"This has to be one of the worst ""mysteries"" I've ever read. The main character is stupid and, for someone who's supposed to be solving a mystery, very blind to the possibilities. It took forever for the mystery to begin, and once it did I had it solved almost immediately. If this book is intended for a 4th grader, it should be a success."
3,are most of us pigeons?,"At least the book is a quick read. Its papers are very short and are mostly meant to be thought provoking, as opposed to being scholarly papers submitted to peer reviewed journals.There was one amusing comparison in one paper. Between people browsing on the web and pigeons trained by Skinner. A light hearted but not entirely joking analogy that pokes fun at the shallowness of much web browsing. Such, the web now puts the world at your fingertips. But most users never aspire to any deep purpose, given the richness of access. Are most of us pigeons?"
3,I wanted to like it,"I've heard so many rave reviews of this book on message boards for parents who follow the Waldorf approach to early childhood. The illustrations are ok, cute pictures of small children participating in autumn activities. There is no story written here, only the one you create yourself while looking at the book with your children. The illustrations are ok, but I don't feel like they are so so wonderful as others have said. It is very short as well, so I'd have to say that it isn't worth the money. There are other autumn books that are more worth my time."
1,Sub-standard locking mechanism,This is a great looking fender which is let down by a rubbish lokcing mechnism and is terribly noisy on the road..I have spent over half an hr trying to adjust the fender to eliminate the sound to absolutely no avail. Also the grip keeps loosening..Do youself a fovor and avoid this one.
3,"Protects from rain great, but installations a pain, and easy to steal","This thing was a pain to install. I realized after I spent 15 minutes trying to get it on in the cold rain, that I should have just removed my quick-release seat post to get it on. But some people don't have that option. Threading the nylon through the sprocket hole in the freezing cold was infuriating. And when I finally did get it on, it would slip around, and not stay aligned with the wheel. Even after some tweaking, it wouldn't stay true for long. When it was true, it was great. You could adjust it to get really close to the wheel, and it would protect me very well from the spray. I really appreciated the adjustability of it. But they really need a better mounting system. Unfortunately it is MUCH easier to remove than install. All it takes is a little flip of the tension arm, and off it goes. Not good, if you plan on leaving it on overnight, outside, as I found! And like that, poof. He's gone."
1,Good in theory sucks in practice,The mount was easy enough but the fender could not hold its weight as soon as i hit a slight bump the fender hit the rear wheel and the plastic cracked.
1,Doesn't fit if you have a rear rack or certain types of brake set-up,"Warning: if you have a rear cargo rack or rear brake wires that meet behind your seat post, you will not be able to use this type of fender."
5,what's not to like!?,"Have used this for years until I melted mine in the dishwasher. I have no idea what that negative review is about- the slide latches securely and the tray can't fall out when inserted properly- or even improperly! The only way the tray could fall out is if the slide isn't put in at all. Anyway, I couldn't find this in any store so am buying another on-line. This pill organizer is the best! Fill an entire week at a time without opening 28 separate doors which eventually fall off anyway. Would buy it at 3 times the price."
1,Terrible design,"While the individual cubbies can be locked, the entire pill box can be slid open with no lock on the side. This is not safe and does not work as described. I don't understand why anyone would design anything like this."
4,Fuhrman Diet Presented in the Metric System,"This is Dr. Fuhrman's wonderfully successful diet; but it should be called a food lifestyle, since he teaches a new awareness in eating and what effects foods have on the human body. Just be aware that this particular version is printed in metric units... and it doesn't say so in the description."
1,go ahead and buy if..,You want 1). Runs in the poster. They obviously printed on a sucky printer.2). The graphics are terribly put together. It looks like a six year old sat on photoshop and put images off of google onto a 11x17 document and printed it out. I'm a graphics student and I could have made this a lot better its not put together well and its not made correctly. Don't waste your 8$
3,i love lucy framed poster,i bought this framed poster for my wife. she is a big lucy fan. the only problem i had with this is it was NOT framed in glass it was PLASTIC!!NOT SURE IF THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE DESCRIPTION. otherwise it was delivered in good time and well protected.
3,Too long.,"Mailer's genius does not shine in this novel. The story is loose and the characters are flat. For better Mailer, read The Executioner's Song."
3,Dark and Dreamlike,"My first experience with Norman Mailer's work. Wanted to read ""Naked and the Dead"" but unavailable. Settled for a ""quick"" work. Very dark book, but excellently written. Descriptive look into the psyche, but I often re-read passages to get the meaning. Has definitely whetted my appetite for more from this author and will try ""The Executioner's Song"" next."
3,Live-wire writing but ultimately tedious,"My first read of Mailer. The writing is vivid, descriptive and hard. The classic New York world of male lead surrounded by liquor, nightclubs, allusions of money is well described. Plot is interwoven but I couldn't wait to finish the book so that I could read something new!"
1,Pretentious ...,"The sensibility Mailer is so proud of conveying here is that of Rojack, a boring wife-murderer with all the usual pseudo-Hemingwayesque appurtenances. If you like books in which the women are all ..., the narrator is a good boxer (surprise!), and the prose is tediously macho hard-nosed drivel, this is the book for you. This is a thoroughly revolting and vulgar book written by our prime novelistic vulgarian who, in 1964, stooped so low as to namedrop the recently slain JFK right in the first sentence of this book. The novel is packed with references to people and things smelling bad, and its stench as a whole is such that after reading even a few paragraphs of it, you'll feel a need to shower."
3,Lurid and Not Mailer's Best by a Longshot!,"One gets the impression here that the famous author is ""showing off"" his knowledge of New York big shots, big money, big violence (including murder and rape), big hotels (the Waldorf), and having a scalding ego trip in the process. Also doing some big, unnecessary namedropping (like JFK- the biggest name at the time). Sure this book has its moments, though the unnecessary sadism trumps most of them! In fact, I'm usually a big admirer or this many faceted penmen. His collection ""Time of our Times"" is among the great single author anthologies out there (chosen by Mr. Mailer, no less!)..So even if this one's not a real dog, given the vast quality of much of his stuff, this one should be kept near the bottom of his, mostly outstanding, oevre!"
2,Not his best,"I couldn't believe this is the author of ""The Naked and the Dead"", ""Harlot's Ghost"", and ""The Executioner's Song""! I think for this book Mailer tried a little too hard to be ""cool"", ""stylistic"", whatever, and ended up looking like an unconvincing show-off. Not worth the trouble."
1,Mailer Bomb,"I know people who reread Proust every year. I know people whose favorite book is Finnegan's Wake. But I have never known anyone of any intelligence who has made it through a novel by Norman Mailer. This book is a good example of why that is. Although the prose is serviceable, it is pointlessly obfuscating. The characters are leaden and the ideas, such as they are, are puerile. Mailer is perfect for readers of very little brain who want to think they are intellectuals. His books are pornographic soap operas for high school sophomores."
2,Book about sayings of Jesus without Jesus,"As far as I can tell, Easwaran only mentions Jesus in this whole book once. You would think Meister Eckhart is the more important spiritual figure than Jesus Christ, although the book purports to be about the Beatitudes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. The book is well-written, but I find this kind of spiritual co-opting to be very misleading. I can't help but wonder if the ulterior purpose of an author such as this is not to diminish Jesus' stature by effectively turning him into just another mystic. I have no problem with spiritual books having nothing to do with religion. But I find it misleading to market the book as if it is a book about Christianity, right down to the picture of Mary adoring the baby Jesus on the book's cover."
2,Fairy Stories,"Wendell Berry writes well, and tells a good story. His characters are developed and fully believable. He has, however, a rose-colored view of the past. He ignores events that do not fit into that view. In short, he is very readable, if one suspends all knowledge of history. The book begins in 1888 and ends about one hundred years later. Reading Berry, one would think that Kentucky was never involved in the Civil War/War Between the States, or sent anyone to Cuba in the Spanish/American War, nor a single person to the Great War/WWI. When he finally recognizes the effects of WWII on one of the members of the community, his descriptions seem to better fit the first of those two world wars then the second.In short, it's great nostalgia, but lacks verisimilitude."
3,couldnt relate,"ok i joined a pure fiction book club.bad move.the person who choses the books (ive never met her)has to be the silliest woman in the blk community.these books cant be taken seriously.just plain silly. i cant relate to the characters in any of the books ive read.but i have to read them.several family members loves the clubs so-called literature selections.what ever happened to toni morrison,bernice mcfadden and others?have they even heard of them.i dont wanna spoil it for others.so i wont right a review.sum it up 3 silly women and 2 dumb men..."
3,Alright.,"This book was just so...so...average. the first three chapters are well-written,the middle was boring and made me yawn,and theend made me mad but could excite others,depending on what kindof person you are. oh and to let everyone know that Ashley andJaQuavis are TWO people. I want to see the 2 author's solo efforts because i think them together was just NOT good."
5,Dirty Money,"This is a great book, it start out slow, but once you get really into the book it awesome. If you have a thin bit of concern about how to live the tuff life this book is it, so take the time out to read the book. Where is the movie?"
5,A MUST READ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OMG I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE DAY I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN I HOPEE AND PRAY DERS A PART 2 TOO DIS BOOK IT WAS ON POINT FROM THA FIRST TOO LAST PAGEE....IT KEPT MEE ON THA END OF MA SIT WAITIN TOO SEE WHATS GONE HAPPEN...PLEASE READ THE BOOK =]
5,AMAZING,"omg omg omg! this book was amazing! couldnt stop reading it so i finished it in one night! anari lost everyone in her life, fell in love, doubted her love and went out on a hustle and killing spree! its just so much, i dont wanna spoil it! make the purchase, its VERY well worth it!"
2,Why?,"It's your regular urban fiction story. However A&J are always murdering their main characters. I don't understand why. I read the first few (really 3) chapters and read the end. I mean like 2 or 3 characters had died in the first chapter. So could you really blame me for reading ahead? The main character had a baby father, he died, then his side piece comes into the picture and becomes friends with the main character only to try and take her child. It's a really messy story. Page turner ..YES, but not in the good way. P.s to the authors ya'll need to stop killing your main characters."
3,book review,Great book hated the way it ended. Left you hanging. Wish author would have expanded on the way that she ended hopefully there will be another book
4,Great Storyline!Get Money Like Scarface!,"Dirty Money to me read like a movie on the big screen.You know how you always have to pay attention to the beginning of a movie to understand the middle & end? Well, that's exactly like how Dirty Money was. It started off slow with a girl name Anari talking about her life & losing her boyfriend then it speeds up when her son is kidnapped by someone she trusted.Then it gives you another twist of her changing her identity to ""Tony"" and taking after the character in Scarface.The ending will surely blow you away because it blew me away.Only thing, the synopsis had nothing to do with the book.But overall great book."
4,Consequences...,"Dirty Money is a quick and easy read. It shows what can be the outcome of Dirty Money and the game that goes with it. This story shows just how hate, lust,revenge and the love of money will destroy all. While the story held my attention, I was taken aback about the killing of a child...and the ending pyssed me off, so much so that I couldn't rate this book a five... Other than that the authors handled their business..."
1,Garbage In Garbage Out,"This book was picked by one of our club members, we had 1 month to complete the book and give a review. It took a couple hours to complete the book (I had to put it down several times due to brain freeze), I tossed it in the trash where it belonged."
3,Dirty Money,"This book was interesting, a good read but so predictable. I really didnt finish the last few chapters.. I can say it kept me looking for what I already knew what would happen. so Maybe there is a part two in the making.... Because I know Tiffany isnt getting away with what she did... Too many good people died in this book for that to happen... Where is Part Two at???"
2,It was okay,It was kinda stupid in the beginning but it got a littl better toward the end. This is my first timer reading them I hope their other titles are better.
4,Be careful of the friends you choose!,This was a very interesting book! Twists and turns beyond belief! This book was so real that you can imagine being there!!!Anari had her struggles as a young girl but hustler-made Maurice was her savior and her one true love. Anari had it all with Maurice including a son that he never got to know.Drama unfolds and Anari loses those close to her and revenge replaces a once-happy heart. She becomes part of the game and hits hard in it becoming a totally different person but baddest broad in heels. I love this book and hope to see a sequel.The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because I am big on grammar and spelling and her editor starting fallin off after chapter 13...~~~NO FLATTERY REVIEWS~~~
4,DAYUM DAYUM,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK..I HONESTLY HAD HOPE THAT HER BABY WAS STILL ALIVE AND MY HEART WAS SO BROKEN WHEN I FOUND OUT HE WASN'T..THIS IS A BOOK WHERE THE BAD GUY ACTUALLY WINS AND ALTHOUGH IT MADE ME UPSET ABOUT THAT I LOVED THE DIFFERENCE THAT IT BROUGHT OPPOSED TO THE REST OF THE BOOKS I'VE READ..I LOVED THIS IT AND I GIVE THEM THEIR PROPS ON IT..
2,Typical,It was ok I read it in one day .....Typical book though- black girl falls in love with a drug dealer and the rest is history
3,Not impressed.,"Ashley and JaQuavis are two of my favorite writers. I can honestly say that I didn't like this book at all. This book was very predictable, unlike their other books. Check out from the library instead of purchasing."
4,Great Read!,I love this book from beginning.... but i was alittle upset that you didn't knw until you buy Supreme Clientele that is a sequel ....
4,Die Hard A&J Fans,"I actually began reading Ashley & Jaquavis starting with ""The Cartel"" so I was instantly addicted. As soon as I realized that had other numerous other books, I quickly purchased and read them all. ""Dirty Money"" is their first book and I can honestly tell it was their first book, but still very entertaining nonetheless. To better enjoy this book. I would definitely recommend reading part 2 Supreme Clientele."
5,Must Read*****,"All I have to say is that this book is so full of action its not even funny. I let a friend read it and she didnt even go to sleep, she actually stayed up all night trying to finish it. Does anyone know if there is a sequel to this book?"
5,Dirty Money,"This book had my attention right from the beginning. Nothing happened too fast and there was excitement in every chapter. It reminds me of so much that I saw growing up in da 'hood. You must read ""Supreme Clientele"" afterward. It's even better as a part II. I look forward to the very end, if there will be one."
4,It was pretty good,I liked this book but i think the reason i mainly liked it is because i read supreme clientele FIRST which was kind of like a low key sequel to dirty money (i was unaware of that which is why i just read supreme clientele first) so even though dirty money ended one way supreme clientele will let you know the true outcome of this story dont sleep on this!!
5,DIRTY !!!!!,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK A TRUE PAGE TURNER !!! BUT SAD TO SAY I HATED THE WAY THE BOOK ENDED I HOPE ITS A SEQUEL............. IF NOT O WELL BUT A WONDERFUL BOOK OVER ALL... GREAT JOB GIRLS !!!!!!
4,Good Book. Bad Ending,"If you're familiar with A&J you know what to expect as far a the theme (romance+streets) and the TERRIBLE ENDING. This is honestly the ONE time where I reeeeeally wish they would've just let the novel have a ""happy ending"". Anyway, this book was soooooo good. You'll read it in no time!"
5,Damn,"The ending was very disappointing and rather unexpected but the story kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end so I guess it was an ok book, if you're into happy endings like me then don't expect it with one."
5,dirty money was a good title,"didnt know there was another part, until i started reading . would make it a lot easier to order if we know there was another part even if it was titled different. still enjoyed reading it."
4,loved it,Great book started off good was a page turner however didn't like the way the book ended but overall great book.
5,OK...I liked it!,"I must admit that when I first started reading this book, I wasn't feelin' it. But I kept reading and somewhere around the 4th or 5th chapter I fell in love with the story & couldn't put this book down! The storyline really had me on the edge of my seat and towards the end I couldn't read fast enough! That ending blew me away (& made me a little angry) but I just KNOW there will be a sequel and I can't wait to read it! Don't sleep on this novel..."
4,One of the Best,"Dirty Money was one of the best books I have ever read. I could'nt put it down. Anari was put through so much and I felt connected with her character. It was a page turner for real. The drama never stopped. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves to read. It's the best street novel out, hands down. The only thing i didnt like is how my favorite character died. But I'm not going to spoil the surprise. This book was good!"
1,Do not purchase Kindle edition,"There is no table of contents, index, index of first lines, or index of poets in the Kindle edition. In addition, the book is not indexed so you cannot search for a poet or poem by name. The print book is 1130+ pages long. It is unconscionable for Amazon to sell this item on Kindle. (I had carefully checked the ""look inside"" feature of the print book and it includes all the above features.) This borders on fraud. I had to spend fifteen minutes on the phone getting a refund--and the customer service tech assured me that there is NO way to be sure in advance that a book is indexed or has a table of contents. ( I am rating it one star because Amazon won't allow me to give it no stars.)"
3,no work of art,"I much prefer autobiographies to other biographies. Biographies tend to be clumsily assembled or stitched or thrown together and filled out with plodding prose. And so this biography. Well, at least you get some kind of overview of Leonard Cohen's life and here and there some fragments of Leonard Cohen's incisive wit. Two samples:Author: My publisher wants to know if this can be considered an authorized biography.L.C.: It can be considered a tolerated biography, benignly tolerated.Leonard Cohen is interviewing his famous actress girlfriend Rebecca De Mornay:Rebecca: The great advantage to having you interview me is that I won't have to field questions about Leonard Cohen.L.C.: Yes, let's talk about Leonard Cohen. What's he really like?Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
4,A wonderful talent!,Another great album from Hawksley Workman! I could just listen to his voice all day. It's one of those albums that grows on you the more you listen to it. He is definitely a favorite of mine!
3,For serious scholars only!,"This is a collection of lectures, given by John Dunn, a Professor of Political Theory at the University of Cambridge. In the first one he argues for the importance of a historical perspective in political thought. He also examines contractualism, socialism, racism, governments and states' interdependence, the European Union, the nation state and the heritage and future of the European political left. Professor Dunn provides a stimulating overview of current historical and political thought, which provides a thought-provoking starting point for students of political theory. Unfortunately, he writes in an almost impenetrable, long-winded academic style which would be completely off-putting to anyone except the most committed scholar."
5,Phenomenology meets Physics,"This is a thoughtful, rather original treatment of light and space in cinematic media that effectively weds the visible with the invisible, the real with the unreal, the phenomenological with the physical. If you expect philosophy, you will find a kind of poetry here. Lippit wallows in a liminal space, finding and expanding fuzzy in-between areas that have been problematic or neglected in cinema studies. Accessibility isn't Lippit's main priority; nor is coherence, strictly speaking. Instead, he submerges his thought in the present zeitgeist and observes the numerous dialectics inherent in the physical world and exploited by cinema."
3,LFK & Sam,"Well written, but in the reference of a mob boss's daughter. Sketchy links between Giancana and the CIA/Intelligence community to facilitate the assassination."
3,"JFK and Sam, brings out the facts","I already knew the story that this book was going to tell so I was more interested in the presentation. The story is compelling and needs to be gotten out more in the press. The book, however is very badly written and tends to retell everything several times in the interest of making it more lengthy. If you don't know the story, get the book !"
3,"Decent book, esp. on the MAFIA","My dad got me this book for Christmas---very good expose on the Mafia, lukewarm about JFK and so forth. Still, interesting read."
3,JFK & Sam,"Interesting read, closley follows JFK Murder Solved web site. James Files did it with help of others."
4,A basic yet comprehensive gardening book,"This book covers a lot of ground (no pun intended!) in its pages--everything from lawns and landscaping to container gardening and houseplants. Numerous photographs and diagrams illustrate the book, and it has a nice section where common perennials and annuals are pictured. If you want a good basic reference on all kinds of gardening, this one is a super start. I come back to it even as I've added more specialized books to my gardening library."
5,garden,"Book was in great shape, shipped to me at great speed. Very informative. thank you. Lots of helpful info that i'm glad it's so easy to purchase needed items at great prices"
3,Dissappointed,"The theme and context of the book are admirable. Anything showing people how to find the Lord is inspiring in my opinion. However, the writing of this book was more scripture than story. I love all of Robin Lee Hatchers Books, old and new, but was not impressed by this one."
1,Leyden Cheese,"Leyden cheese is one of Holland's main cheeses. It has a delicious characteristic flavor which comes from Cumin seeds. This cheese is spiced with Caraway seeds, a completely different flavor. This is not genuine Leyden cheese. If you really want genuine Leyden,purchase the Farmhouse Leyden or regular Leyden through Igourmet."
3,Maybe a little too powerful for its own good,"This little machine can indeed be a very useful tool depending on what it is being used for. I found that it was a little too powerful when chopping up certain softer ingredients such as tomatoes. For example, when I make salsa, I add some tomatoes, sweet onions, chiletepins, cumin, salt, and pepper. When I chop these ingredients, however, they liquefy almost instantly. In fact, I almost always use the grinder (dull part of the blade) to preserve some consistency. If you are looking to use this machine to strictly puree ingredients, look no further. If you need this machine to chop ingredients while preserving texture, look for a less powerful machine."
2,Nice But Broke Quickly After Warranty Period,"Nice product that worked as adverstiser for several uses but eventually burned out and was in the garbage within four months. I only used this processor for small jobs that should have been ""easy"".Add this reviewer to list of reviewers who feel Cuisinart items seem prone to breakage after the warranty period has inspired.My full size processor is getting old too, so I think I'll just bite the buller and a nice full size KitchenAid processor and be done with it. I will avoid Cuisinart processors in the future."
1,Will NOT repurchase this item,I bought this Cuisinart Mini Prep about 1 year ago.It just died on me.It will immediately be replaced with something else.There MUST be better quality food processors on the market.Cheap!
4,Most helpful letter writing tool I've read,In my profession this book is essential! I am an administrative assistant and have read and used dozens of letter writing guides and this one by far is the best. The examples of openings and closings are among the most eloquent and really get the point across. The salutation guide and section on how to address executives to homemakers certainly are the best.
5,GREAT and a catchy name.,I have both the audio and the CD and I share them both with my mom and sisters. Easier to carry around than a book and easier to share. We love the recipes.
5,A pleasure to watch,"Interesting, humorous, entertaining. My husband and I stumbled upon Gathering Remnants one day and have watched in over again with the same fascination in the subject matter. When I was a kid I wanted to be a cowgirl and this illustrates why, although I doubt I would have cut the mustard."
4,Ferris Bueller's Day Off rewritten with a sense of humor and a dash of intelligence.,"Teens complain about their parents' rules, restrictions, and general uncoolness. This movie takes a humorous look at the question: What if you had the house to yourself—no rules, no limits, no parents? A high school boy finds himself suddenly parent-free. Over the following months, he experiences the thrills and challenges of independence and wins his parents' respect."
1,Not that great.,"I bought this movie, because it had Seth Green in it. So yeah, Seth was cute and all, but the movie wasn't that great. I got bored watching it. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great Flash!,"I was wanting a quality flash at an affordable price and that is exactly what I got with this unit. I especially like that it only uses 2 AA batteries instead of the traditional 4AA. It is a very powerful flash. I have a Nikon D70S and used this flash in manual mode. It can sync at 1/60 and 1/125 and stop action. I was unable to use it in ttl mode with auto zoom, but I didn't get a book with it and will continue to play with it to see if I can get that part to work. Regardless if I can use the TTL mode or not, this flash is great and very affordable!"
5,Excellent Childrens Book!!!!,"This book is very highly recommended for use with young children. The flow of the words is very natural and makes you feel like you are on the highlands of Scotland. Teachers can use this book to teach sequence, counting to ten and other areas. Very well written and illustrated!"
4,Decent food processor,"This is a solid, decent 11-cup food processor. I haven't had any problems with it and have used it to shred carrots and cabbage, make hummus and nutella (oh, yeah, it was awesome), and ""grind"" meat. Now, it worked wonderfully for these things, but, really, don't go putting liquid in this food processor. Use your head: this is a food processor not a liquid processor (a.k.a. a blender).This processor is quite sturdy and has a wonderfully heavy base, so it doesn't ""dance"" on the counter top. It also looks quite nice, especially for the price. Its motor seems to be powerful enough too, given how well it worked for the (very thick, dense) nutella."
4,Quick delivery,I am pleased with my experience with this seller. My product arrived (packaged well) in 7 days from the day I ordered. The product was in good shape and it was clear that every effort was made to provide the customer with item as expected. The price was considerably lower than all the other low prices which was a HUGE plus for me. Product was missing the How to DVD but for the price I am still very pleased. And anyway there was a short video online that gave me all the info I needed. I would suggest to the seller to be sure and let the customer know if something is missing prior to purchase (this is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5).
5,Best purchase ever!,I LOVE this food processor. It looks nice. It's easy to use. I've become more interested in new recipes due to this purchase. Easy to clean up too.
1,NO CUISINART FOOD PROCESSOR,"I bought a new 11-cup Cuisinart Food Processor in March. It started SMOKING when used in August. I returned it at my expense to a service center in NJ & demanded a new motor. In return, I rec'd my motor/base which smokes more than ever. The Cuisinart ""customer service"" is abysmal. They still will not guarantee a new motor/base to replace my defective 5-month old processor. Ridiculous. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I urge you to avoid Cuisinart. Unless, of course, you don't mind disposing of a product that costs over $140 when it fails just months after purchase.Cuisinart DLC-2011CHB Prep 11 Plus 11-Cup Food Processor, Brushed Stainless"
1,broken in under 6 months,"In less than 6 months, the motor just up and quick. Had very gentle and infrequent use, so it wasn't remotely abused. Amazon refund policy very short and doesn't cover. I don't think I'll buy expensive appliances from Amazon anymore. Bought the Breville Sous Chef - now that is a quality machine that will last a lifetime. I believe Cuisinart has gone downhill over the years and isn't remotely what it used to be."
1,Cuisinarts handling of problems is SO negative!,"Since August 9, 2012, I have used the Cuisinart food processor (9-cup) in the first place for shredding lettuce, cucumber etc. Fantastic. Having it for 2 weeks I tried a recipe from the Cuisinart instruction booklet, during processing the machine blew up, thick smoke coming from the motor. Via the suborganization from Amazon I contacted Cuisinart and told them the experience, they were not helpful at all. It came down to ....send us the machine....at my own expence (both ways). The Cuisinart person I talked to was not better than a taperecorder.Amazons' intermediate organization was fortunately very helpful and gracious and solved the problem.A last thing about Cuisinart products I am familiar with they never gave me a reason to complain."
5,Cuisinart Food Processor,"A rugged, excellent, easy to use processor that is practically ready to go...right out of the box. This is the third Cuisinart product that I've recently purchased and to date, I haven't been disappointed."
4,No Dough,"This is not your mother's (or your first) Cuisinart. It does very well grating cheese and probably with general mixing. However, I tried three different dough recipies, all with similar results. Twice, the mixture was forced up into the blade shaft, eventually causing the blade to lift. The third dough was somewhat firm, and the processor quickly bogged down and overloaded. I'll stick to my Kitchenade mixer for future doughs.Oh well, my first one was Made in France. Guess where this one's made? Chopsticks not included."
3,Disappointed,I found the DLC-2011N Prep 11 to be easy to use with good power for my type of cooking. I was disappointed with the short center post in the processor bowl. The bowl will only hold a few cups of liquid without leaking over the top of the center post. This processor is not a good choice if you want to process liquid or wet ingredients.
2,Too many fragile parts,The part that locks the bowl down broke right after we got this. The price is high for a processor that short-cuts some of the smaller pieces.Surprisingly Cusinart actually sent a replacement with one phone call but still that is a hassle.
3,Making Busicuts,"Whenever I make homemade buttermilk buscuits, I have to put very cold butter into the flour and then use a pastry knife or similar to reduct the butter to pea sized pieces. One recipe suggested that this task is much easier it you use a food processor.I tried this with the 11 cup Cuisinart. When I hit the pulse button, somehow flour escapes from the container (some through the tube and some through the place where the cover fits on the bowl). It isn't a large amount-just a slight snowfall.Not sure what I can do to correct this problem."
1,terrible customer service,"Okay, so first I get a machine with a broken lid. Call customer service, they say I have to send back original lid at my expense. Get the replacement lid. Guess what, it doesn't fit. Call customer service she said I obviously am doing something wrong. I tell her I am not an idiot and I know when something doesn't fit. She says she'll send me another one. I say why, if this one doesn't fit why will the next one. Said I obviously need a top and bottom that match. She say oh, maybe you have a BPA free bottom. So we check and sure enough I do. So she says she'll send me a BPA free lid. And I should get it in 10 days, Great, Christmas will be here and gone before I get to use this machine. She said she would schedule a UPS pick up of lid number 2. They have yet to get it, it's just sitting on my front porch, waiting for someone to come along and steal it. Merry Christmas."
5,Where have you been all my life?,"Seriously, I cannot believe this is my first food processor. I love to cook, and this makes cooking 100 times more fun! I don't think I can every buy canned/jarred pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce again. I also now buy just the blocks of cheese and grate my own (it takes seconds!). My husband made me an omelet last weekend and I asked what he did differently this time. It was the cheese! Food tastes so much better!"
3,Good product but poor accessory selection,"We ordered this unit a few days ago, received it, and the unit itself seems fine and well-built (we haven't actually used it yet). I bought it because it seemed like an identical-except-a-little smaller version of the DLC-2011. And it is, but there's one *other* important difference: there are way fewer accessories available for this model! The -2011 has a selection of different slicing and grating disks and other such things available, the -2009 apparently does not.So if having a variety of accessories is important to you, I'd suggest buying the larger model. Or, ironically, the smaller (DLC-2007) one, it also has a better accessory selection!"
5,#1 Gift of The Season!!,"If you're looking for that perfect gift for someone special - LOOK NO FURTHER - you have found it! I have been using this Cuisinart model for nearly a year now almost daily. It has saved me both time and money. I no longer buy the more expensive ready prep items at the grocery store like shredded cheese or ready cut veggies. I can do the same thing in mere seconds at a fraction of the cost. I have even sliced tomatoes in this unit. For those like me who are short on storage space, this is great - all accessories fit within the unit. And yes, it makes food prep more enjoyable - if you have to do the job you may as well have fun with it! Oh, did I mention its dishwasher safe?"
1,Horrible Customer Service! Missing Parts!,"I was very excited to start using my Cuisinart but to my surprise when I unpacked it, the mixing/chopping blade was missing. I called Cuisinart and the conversation went like this:Me : ""The chopping blade is missing. Can you please replace it?""Cusinart : ""We do not replace missing parts because we make sure everything is in the box""Me : ""But you didn't because it's missing a part.""Cuisinart: ""We can waive the shipping costs on a replacement part which costs $33.""Me : ""Why would I pay $33 for something that is missing from a new product?""Cuisinart : ""You have to return the item to where you bought it""Me : ""Can I speak with your manager?""Cuisinart : ""I will have them call you back within 24 hours""So 48 hours later and no call from Cuisinart was enough to make me return this to Amazon for a refund and purchase a Kitchen Aid. From my experience and reading the other comments on here about Cuisinart's Customer Service, I suggest you do not purchase from them."
1,poor factory quality control,"I purchased this food processor because it had good reviews. when I received it the lid would not close. I went to Williams-Sonoma to look at the same model and the lid went on and off with ease. I returned the processor for a replacement, the second processor had the same problem. I called cuisinart and after going over every step of assembly we both determined that this was also faulty. amazon is great with returns, cuisinart not so much. their solution was to ship my brand new purchase to them for repair."
1,Abysmal packaging and terrible customer service,"I received this item after a friend had purchased it from AMAZON. It was impossible to separate the small and large pushers. Then to add insult to injury there was no engraved serial number on the bottom. The 5 digit number on the sticker above was""not a valid serial number"" and I couldn't get the customer service person from Cuisinart to even give suggestions. I am not sure who is responsible, Cuisinart or Amazon, but the food processor is being returned."
4,Cuisinart 11 Plus Food Processor,"A happy for my wife which she had picked out. Very nice item, well made and the food its been helping to make has been great. Comes w/video prep/user guide--very helpful.The Kitchen Aid food processor rated higher according to my wife but I had already ordered this one."
4,"Cuisinart DLC-2009CHB Prep 9 9-Cup Food Processor, Brushed Stainless",Great style and durability. Most of all a powerful motor that gets the job done. Excellent value. Overall very pleased.
5,Nice Product,"My new 11 cup Prep Plus just arrived (3 days sooner than expected -- thank you, Amazon) and I'm all jazzed to start using it. The DVD that came with the machine is helpful for a food processor novice such as myself as it shows various ways to use it other than the minimum grating and chopping. I'm particulary excited about being able to grind meats and make breads. I was a bit worried about having enough space to keep it on my counter full time, but because of the streamlined shape, it doesn't take up as much room as expected -- and the brushed stainless base is quite attractive. Plus its not really light-weight, so not having to move it in and out of a cupboard is a plus. I recommend getting the disk and blade keeper for the extra attachments that came with the machine. After seeing how sharp these guys are, it seems safer to have them not laying loose inside a cupboard or drawer. So, as Msr. Pepin would say: ""Happy Cooking!"""
5,Food Processor,My Wife wanted one so bad so I splurged and got her one and she couldn't be happier about the purchase
4,Good for everything except onions,"This processor works very well for almost everything, chopping vegetables grating cheese etc. Makes food prep so much easier for a large party or family dinner. The only thing it didn't do well was onions. It turned them into a liquidy mush! Just use a knife. Other than that I am happy with this purchase."
3,Cover is bulky and hard to clean,"I purchased a 7-cup version of this about a year ago. I recently bought the 9-cup and found that Cuisinart no longer includes the basic cover, which is what I used with the smaller unit 99.9 percent of the time. The cover shown in the photo comes in 3-parts, stands a lot taller than the basic cover and has nooks and crannies that are hard to clean and dry. The functionality of the food processor is still good but the cover is a pain."
5,best food processor,easy to use and easy to clean up just remember not to fill liquids past fill line it will handle it no problem just makes a bit of a mess under the cup great product would recommend to friends and family
4,Hooked!,"I am so glad I purchased this food processor. It works so well and is so smooth. Not herky jerky like my old food processor. Great buy for all the attachments that come with it. The DVD is very helpful in showing all the uses and the recipes in the book, great! Get this!"
4,"Great for Pizza Dough, Not so great on pastry dough","I'm going to have to search for a plastic attachment to use for pie crusts and such. So far without being able to have many speed choices, the current attachments into dust when trying to make pie crusts and some other pastries.But it is a very sturdy machine. Guess I may not be use to it and still miss my previous food processor that I had for 30 years, may it RIP."
5,A Powerful helper,"Since I've received my Cuisinart food-processor, I've made dough, cole slaw and chopped a bunch of veggies...a few times each. This machine is very easy to put together and does a wonderful job at any task. I make bread dough and it comes out so well that I don't even need to knead it by hand anymore. Just love it. It is a very versatile machine and I can't imagine going back to kneading a 4 cup dough with my hands.The processor looks very nice - doesn't occupy that much space and the machine is very sturdy.An excellent value for the money!"
1,problems with attachments and optional parts,"Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor, WhiteCuisinart DLC-2011 food processor, 11 cup.In the instruction manual and DVD Cuisinart lists crucial attachment parts such as a whisk attachment. However, they discontinue these important parts while still selling the main product that has very few attachment parts. Had I known that these parts are not available as advertised I would not have bought this product. Cuisinart's customer service is unhelpful and brisk to rude, will not take the food processor back. They sell it under false promises."
1,Defective Product Had To Be Returned,"I wish I had read the most current reviews before wasting my time buying this Item. Apparantly, Amazon has shipped dozens that have the same problem. The manufacturer used too much and too sticky shrink wrapping all over the mechanisms, resulting in the small pusher mechanism being fused together. The manufacturer obviously lacks quality control and Amazon lacks ingtegity. We're left with having to repackage everything, mail it back and wait for our refund to be processed before we can purchase a reputable machine from a reputable seller. Both Cuisinart and Amazon get one star for this disappointing transaction."
1,HATE this processor!,"I bought this processor from a big department store. I hate it so much that I am reviewing here. It is flimsy. It also does not work--in prepping a dinner recently, the mayonnaise I was making did not fully emulsify--there was raw egg at the bottom after lengthy processing with a slow stream of oil. I then moved on to a compound butter--the garlic and shallots in the butter never really pureed and, again, at the bottom of the processor, were ingredients (lime juice, chunks of room temp butter etc.) that never incorporated into the mixture. This is an AWFUL machine--and I am a long-time Cuisinart devotee. Taking it back to the department store and praying to find something better. This one is crap."
3,not all there,"Came on time but was missing attachments. I call amazon they gave me 16 dollars credit, but the attachment that was missing cost me 29 dollars."
1,The bowl broke after several months.,"I was so disappointed that the ""shatterproof"" bowl broke after such a short time. I have been contacting Cuisinart and it's not going to be easy to get a replacement. It is unusable without the bowl and not sure how to get another one, that likely costs the company only several dollars.The bowl chipped where it is to fit into the bottom housing of the machine, therefore it does not stay in place."
5,"So quiet, easy and powerful!","Just got this processor a few days ago and I love it! I've so far used it to make spinach and artichoke dip, homemade chips, and onion slices for salad. I was very surprised at how quietly it runs, which is great for me; I can prepare foods for the next day while my toddler is sleeping. It's very easy to take apart and put together and cleans very easily. Haven't had any problems with food jams at all. I barely had to apply pressure while making my chips, and it put out 2 potatoes in perfect slices in about as many seconds =) I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
2,PIECE OF JUNK,"Following the recommendations of Cooks Illustrated, I bought the 11-cup Prep Plus food processor two years ago, after having owned a Cuisinart DLC-8 food processor for about 20 years. This second food processor was for use on a boat, and I bought it primarily to multitask, incuding making bread. Storing a stand mixer was not practical. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the Prep Plus. Although it is supposed to have more capacity than the old processor, it seems to be underpowered for the size. I have yet to be able to make bread without the machine stalling, or coming close to it, even following the instructions in the booklet that came with it. And it's not inexperience--I have made LOTS of bread in the old processor. The 11-cup Prep Plus seems to be able to perform other tasks reasonably well, which shouldn't really be a challenge for a decent food processor that cost as much as this one did. Handling dough is the acid test.Steer clear of this made-in-China model."
4,"Not perfect, but meets my needs","I have had no experience with food processors apart from this unit, so I'll admit upfront that my review is without a point for comparison.That said, I have had no issues with the operation of my processor and generally like its features and performance. It saves a considerable amount of time kneading bread, crumbing graham crackers, mincing garlic/onion, making pesto, grating cheese, and mixing cheesecake batter.If I were to have a complaint about its operation it may be that it is a bit too fast. It can be difficult to get a thick, chunky sauce or salsa that is evenly distributed. A few pulses won't chop everything, but go much more and it will be too fine. In general I prefer a smoother, more homogenous mixture, so I'm happy with this operation.My biggest complaint is in cleaning... which isn't a huge hassle, but food/residue likes to get stuck in the blade socket or in the pushers/lid."
4,"So Far, So good!","Received the Prep Plus in great condition. Packaging was excellent. The cover is very tight fitting and does not easily slide/snap into position, nor does it easily slide/snap off (need to use both hands for support as I think trying to do it with 1 hand would break off something). I feel that with usage, the tightness will no longer be a problem due to the wearing of the sliding surfaces. I watched video first. A few items were confusing. The chef who demonstrated removed the pusher assembly first, then the cover. It was not explained why the 2 steps were always done, nor does the book explain. Why not remove them both in one step? Also, it isn't very clear when/why the pusher assembly turns the machine on (my smaller 7 cup Cuisinart just puts the cover in place, then hit the disired button). I am confused but will read the users manual again or call the company and get some help. It is quiet, and very sturdy, looks really nice as well. So far, so good:)"
5,Its great for the price,"I got this as a replacement for one that I brutally abused, and it went up in a puff of smoke. I picked Cuisinart because I've had good luck with their products. I picked this model based on the reviews. I've only used it a couple of times, using the blade. It worked quietly and worked well. The base is heavy, which is a good sign. I've washed the parts (other than the base) in the dishwasher, top rack, as described in the instruction booklet, they came out fine. The equipment is sharp, so some caution needs to be exercised. I want to use the disc's for shredding and slicing. I'll update this if there's anything to note.I read in a review here some place that plastic freezer containers can be used to store the blades and discs. I tried using them and found it a good idea. The blades are easy to put in the container and take out, the discs as well. It saves a couple bucks and might avoid a scrape or two with the disc holders.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Bought it for my daughter,She is a new homeowner and loves it! Experimenting with gleuten-free soup and bread recipes. It is exactly what she wanted.
5,Wifey loves her Cusinart,"My wife says ""she doesn't know how she lived so long without it"" If she's happy I'm happy and I'm reaping the benefits from her fast and easy delights."
2,lousy customer service,while Cuisinart products may be okay I find their customer service impossible. I emailed a question ages ago to customer service and never got any answer. I also telephoned and my call was cut off after I had waited five minutes to speak to someone. Completely disgusted.
1,Short lived,"Started using it for the first time mixing a batter - the food Processor began to smoke and smell hot, before I could unplug it, it stopped working. It was dead after that. Returned it the next day and ordered a Kitchen Aide, haven't had a chance to try it yet. Had to repackage it and pay the shipping to return it. Not a good experience."
2,Faulty locking mechanism,"I ordered the 9 cup version and it's a nice machine in general, well made although it did seem small after having a 14 cup for years. I used it only once but noticed that getting the bowl locked into position was difficult, and the second time it seemed that if i tried much harder it would break. i could get it locked into place but it was such a pain that i decided to send the unit back. i'm convinced that with a couple dozen repetitions the plastic involved in the locking mechanism would have broken. i've noticed other reviewers have had this problem so it seems to be a design flaw in this series of processors. I've ordered the elite 11 cup to get a little more size and hopefully a better design on the bowl locking mechanism."
4,good purchase,Took forever to ship but very happy with the product. It works well and I highly suggest getting the larger nine cup. it does come with slicers and chopper blades so storage can be challenging. I purchased the storage unit for the slicer but it doesn't fit the chopper blade.
4,My first food processor,"This being my first food processor I honestly didn't know what to expect. I relied on Consumer Reports for guidance and bought what I thought was the best choice for my intended uses for this kitchen appliance. Upon removing the Cuisinart from it's box I quickly realized that this thing is solid. Firm heavy base filled with the promise of a strong motor completely sealed for messy cooks like me which makes for easy quick clean up. First use was in making french bread. This was the easiest french bread I've ever made. It's my new toy so to speak so I've got plenty of dishes awaiting it's ample bowl. This being my first FP, my only surprise so far is the realization that there is a liquid line only about two inches above the bottom of the bowl which makes this large bowl useless for blending liquids. So far I'm 9/10ths satisfied with my purchase."
5,The food processor of dreams!,"When I saw this processor turn a loaf of bread into perfect crumbs before I had time to blink, I knew I had met my dream machine. My affection only deepened when I introduced the slicing disk to a pound of mushrooms. With the touch of a button, the bowl was filled with garnish-quality slices. This machine has the power and the size to tackle most any chore. Making dinner is a delight now that the Cuisinart does my slicing and chopping for me. I am much more likely to use fresh ingredients as a result. In fact, I often find myself planning meals around fun new uses for the food processor. I believe that anyone who cooks often would benefit from this product."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I was disappointed that while the bowl supposedly holds 11 cups, for all intents and purposes, for any kind of liquid, you can only process about 5. This is because the design is such that any additional liquid runs over the enclosure on the inside of the bowl that the blade slips over - it only reaches half-way up inside the bowl. Trying to process soup vegetables into a puree was a disaster, until we learned to do LITTLE batches. I also find the safety mechanism clunky. A third complaint is that the drive connection between the motor and the blades is plastic - now how long is that going to last? That's what broke on my last processor, necessitating the purchase of this model (all processors seem to have this limitation - built in obsolescence, as far as I'm concerned.)But it looks good on the kitchen counter. And it weighs a ton, which is good for stability."
5,Pharmacy word book,One of the best word books for people who need drugs words at the tip of the fingers. Very good choice for people who type.
3,Not Her Best,I liked the other two books in the trilogy better. I found Robin's character bo-ring and was unable to get excited about any of her sex scenes. I felt she was a lackluster character. The Marketplace had much more interesting characters.
2,disappoited!,"After reading all of the reviews for this book, I became excited and could not wait to read it. The excitement quickly faded into disappoitment after the first chapter.I compare all books in this genre to a few of my favorites- The Story of O, Justine, and Venus in Fur. The slave lacked eroticism and simply stated excitement. There was nothing that made me want to continue turning the pages besides the great reviews that it received."
1,Not believable and unrealistic with whimpy characters,"I finished reading the book, just to see if it would ever get better...it didn't. BDSM experiences in this book seemed so mechanical and predictable with no psychological impact on the participants, who themselves seemed so superficial and lacked depth and strength. Poorly written and very disappointing and now in the landfill. Next..."
5,A great second book in this series,"Once more, Laura Antoniou takes us into the world of the Marketplace where consensual slaves go through harsh training, then are sold for time limited terms to real owners. This time, she focuses on one slave-girl, Robin, and her journey through training under the hands of Chris Parker and then her life as the sole woman in her gay masters' household. In addition the novel itself, this Mystic Rose edition has a short story, ""A Familiar Ring"", which takes us futher along in Robin's service and gives us a glimpse back into the BDSM community as it exists today. If you liked the first book, you'll enjoy this one just as much."
5,For Adults Only!,This is a Great Collectible! Classic Superman Figure. I usually keep my toys mint in their boxes and never open them. The detail in costume and Face is great. I recommend it.
3,Could have been shorter - but a good look at different part of moon program,"I have been interested in NASA and the Moon Program in particular and have built a small library of astronaut biographies, mission control biographies and a few chronicles of engineering of the vehicles. This book is interesting that it covers a different topic - the Kennedy Space Center. It is written as a history and does feel a little bit ""official"" in parts with details of contracts that probably most don't care too much about. I think it would have been great if the book had been edited down to about half of its 320 page size."
1,Evap line right away!,"I was NOT happy with these tests. We are TTC, so anything that gets hopes up, to be shot down is a NONO. I took 3 test on 3 different days, and each one came up with a faint positive, right away. I went to the doctors for a blood test. BFN [big fat negative] :( I will never purchace these tests agian."
5,Still the best book today 2011,I read her book in the 90's and I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about investing. This book is still current. DIDO to all the other comments.
5,best of 2002,"cd 1 one was favorite compilation disc of the last 2 years. dubby, trippy house and breaks. i actually copied these cd's from my friends. I was wondering if anyone could tell me who mixes each disc? I think craig has the first and lee the second. let me know. thanks!"
4,"A quick, easy reference","This book is a great starting point for those interested in learning more about counseling. It is modeled after the English book ""The Elements of Style,"" and it's numbered format makes it really easy to follow. It can be read from front to back, or skipping around chapters. It was a very easy read and I will enjoy having it around to re-read some of the ""elements"" as the need arises. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in a quick overview of the theories in counseling."
4,Excellent book,This book is for advance or begginner therapist. It's very easy to read and it's small enough to be put in your bag. Very good purchase.
4,Easy to read but VERY fundamental,"Although the book was easy to read and easy to move around in, but it was embarassingly fundamental. I only suggest this book for those who truly are ""beginers""."
5,Don't really see how you can go wrong here...,"I bought this because I'm taking a Wilton cake decorating class at Michael's and my instructor said she liked it. I don't really know what there is to complain about here. The spatula does what it's supposed to to. I love that it's angled (I never heard about something like this before the class!) and it definitely makes icing cakes easier. I also purchased the larger size for some variety. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the price wasn't better on here than in the Michael's store! But, that's just me being cheap...!"
4,Better than a knife.,"When I make cakes, I always use a knife to frost them, which gets pretty messy. When I saw this on Amazon, I thought that this product would make it alot easier for me and I wouldn't have the mess. This product is great, I really like it. No more frosting on my fingers, and it's alot easier to use than a knife."
4,FINALLY BOUGHT ONE!!!!,"After years, no decades! of frosting cupcakes with a butter knife, I finally broke down and purchased an off-set spatula. This one was featured on a PBS cooking show. I have only used it a couple of times but it works well and has no problem with clean up. Glad to have it as a part of my ""kitchen gear"" :)"
3,"NOT a 9"" spatula","I was expecting the blade of this spatula to be 9"" but that is the length of the whole thing. The blade on this one is 3.5"". Be careful that you buy the size you wanted."
5,"Wilton 9 Inch Angled Spatula, With Black Handle",I like the Wilton 9 Inch Angled Spatula. Great for icing cakes and you can use it for other things in the kitchen. I wish I had a shorter one also. But the 9 inch does does a good job.
5,Exactly what I hoped for,"This spatula is the perfect size for all of my baking needs. I haven't had any issues with it, and I would recommend this product."
3,Nothing special,"While there's nothing really wrong with this product, I was not all that impressed. The handle seemed a little lightweight and cheap, and I wound up using a different spatula for my cake after all."
5,Wilton 9-inch angled spatula,"Something else I wish I would have bought a long time ago. This spatula makes frosting cakes and other similar tasks so much easier. Just the fact that it's angled so I can keep my hand above whatever I'm working on makes it worth having. It is flexible, too, so it comes in handy to help remove baked goods from pans or to get under something delicate that I don't want to mess up. I would caution that being careful is important so the spatula doesn't get bent. I also bought the Wilton 13-inch spatula. I use the 9-inch much more often, but the 13-inch comes in handy for layer cakes. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is a serious baker/cook."
5,"Good product, great seller... make sure you know what you're looking for","Great product, quick service. Unfortunately, I thought this book would talk more about what it was like for a foreign service OFFICER, but really it's more about foreign service SPOUSES. Helpful, but I was looking for something a little different."
1,poor,This book is full of relatively worthless and obvious quips about living abroad.There is an entire section devoted to grocery shopping and how it is different in various countries.. no duh. There is also a massive section about Foreign Service wives carrying on about their kids.Most of the accounts in this book are written by Foreign Service spouses and provides very little insight into the Foreign Service.
5,Rivers of a lost coast,"This was a really interesting film for me. I knew many of the guys talked about in the film. To bad they are gone now, but maybe good for them in that they do not see the degraded state of what they once enjoyed. We should all get or stay active to avoid further decline of our north coast resources."
5,Flat Stanley,My grandson was excited to receive this book for his birthday. He has others in this series and reads them often.
5,Flat Stanley is Wonderful,"Aa a former teacher, I used this book with the class to encourage reading. It is also a fun thing to do with several friends and to compare where Flat Stanley was sent."
3,Flat Stanley,I didn't like this story because Stanley turned back to normal. I liked Stanley when he was flat because he could do lots of things. He could go under doors . He could fit in envelopes. He could go through grates. I would have liked this book better if he stayed flat.
4,Good Book,This book is a fine one for average second grade readers. Advanced readers will enjoy the story but not be challenged by the reading.
4,Nice take on a classic story,"I had always loved the original version of Flat Stanley, but decided to go ahead and get this new edition to read to my class at Energy Express (a reading enrichment program for children in West Virginia). I knew it would be easier to get a hold of and would be a bit shorter than the original (which I have found didn't always keep the kid's attention for long due to it's length.)I'm pleased with how it's been adapted; I don't think much was changed. The illustrations are also very good.This is a great story and a lot of fun to read with kids. After we read it we all traced each other on big sheets of end roll and and then painted ourselves and cut them out so we could have flat versions of ourselves. The kids loved it!"
5,Classic Fun,"A truly original premise requiring more than the usual suspension of disbelief, Flat Stanley delivers a light-hearted journey through the life of Stanley Lambchop. Stanley, a typical American boy, finds his life suddenly transformed when he is flattened by a bulletin board. His parents, in language and wit, sound like a television show family from the 50's, but with the off-beat humor and implausible story-line, it somehow all works wonderfully. Jeff Brown has created an interesting dynamic in describing the relationship between Stanley and his older brother, Arthur, who is intermittently inconsiderate and jealous of Stanley's new-found celebrity. Ultimately, however, it is Arthur who saves the day and returns Stanley to his proper size. It is a very engaging, upbeat story that is a fun read for the toddler set. I highly recommend it."
5,Flat Stanley 40th Anniversary Ed.,I purchased this book because my nephew sent me Flat Stanley. I wanted to know more about him. I am glad I did. Thanks to my nephew I have all of the Flat Stanley books so I can understand what they were reading.
5,Very funny imaginative book,This was one of my favorite books as a child. It stimulates the imagination and puts a positive spin on what could be seen as tragedy. It also teaches that there is value in being different - a lesson that we all need to learn!
3,Flat stanley,This is a book about a boy that was squashed by an erase board that his dad gave him. All of the kids at school were jealous because he could slide under doors and fly himself like a kite. You should read this book if you like easy-read books about an inch-thick children.
1,Hated it!!!,My sons third grade teacher asked that he purchase this book for a book report. We both agreed that it was THE most boring book ever!!!!
5,Flat Stanley,Great book for 3rd grade students. Extends to a valuable geography lesson within the classroom.
5,"If You Like To Laugh,Read This Book","Flat Stanley By Jeff Brown. Who is 4 feet tall, 1 inch thick, and 1 inch wide? Stanley Lambchop is. I thought this book was so good I could already visualize the pictures before I even saw them. Stanley&#65533;s worst fear is, is he ever going back to his normal life again? Read this book and find out. If I were to grade this I would give it ten stars. This book is so good. I think you should read Flat Stanley. How does Stanley become flat? Read this book and find out. Stanley has many great adventures."
3,"Do the job, but they do rub","These were easy to install, and do what is expected. They replace an earlier set that stick onto the outside of the door just above the window. I thought these were the same, but instead they snap in place into the window molding, into the same slot as the window goes into as it opens and closes. The shade has a tendency to rub and make an annoying noise just as it starts to come up from the full open position, even though the shade has a little piece of low friction tape right where the window rubs against the shade. I guess the overall look is 'cleaner' than the original set that used two sided tape to stick to the door, but the day to day use is not nearly as effortless as the old set. I find myself thinking about this every time the window goes up and down - not something I really want to be thinking about... I don't think I would buy these again unless I knew that nothing better could be found."
5,looks amazing!,i like this one. I have owned this for 4 months now. Got loads of compliments. very nice one..
2,For Fans only - beware,"Man, was this a disappointment, but as a longtime fan, there really isn't another way to check out this period on video. The first part is simply the studio versions of tracks with live footage mixed in, and the rest is concerts that were poorly recorded. Audio and video is 3rd rate. As I said, for fans only - Uli plays so well, as usual, but this is not the kind of quality release I expected."
2,"Short, fast-paced and boring","From the writing, contrived incidents and wooden characters one would suspect this was written for teenagers. But the setting, on a moon of vice called Vesa, belies this. Jules and Yvette are sent to Vesa to investigate an underground series of kidnappings - apparently 30 people go missing a day but the compromised authorities have let this happen for 20 years!Every character cliche is unleashed here and Jules and Yvette get out of their scrapes with their usual bluster, kung fu and bravado. Doc Smith has missed a good opportunity to create a melange of races and colourful people by instead opting for the 'brawn always wins' scenario. Avoid, despite the pretty cover art."
3,"Use it all time, dropped it twice","I love this mini processor for pesto and mincing onions & garlic. I've had it for more than a year and over that time, I've dropped the plastic bowl/cup twice. The plastic bit on the handle popped off and there's a crack in the side now. Maybe I'm just clumsy, maybe the plastic isn't all that strong, I don't know. The blade is still sharp, the motor is still strong, it's the plastic bowl that broke after a couple drops.We know that accidents happen in the kitchen. Can I blame the thing for breaking when I was the one who dropped it? ... Yes. When I replace this mini processor (yes, I'm still using it even though it's fubar), I won't be buying Cuisinart again."
2,Are blades stainless steel?,"It is a good product & it did simplify our cooking. The recipe book is nice too. The part of the product which I do not like is that the blades are not stainless steel but made of metal. Put a magnet against the blade & it will stick. After a month of use, one of the blades developed a rust spot.Remember to dry the blades such that no water spots remains on it after washing it else you will have rust spots on your blades."""
1,Don't trust Amazon,"Since I have used Amazon for books, I decided to try them for this appliance. What a bad decision! The food processor arrived without the additional blades, spatula, and cookbook! Unfortunately I didn't discover this until I unwrapped all of the other pieces. And now Amazon says to contact the manufacturer? What a ripoff by Amazon."
2,Cuisinart DLC 2001BCN,"Arthritis finally forced me to purchase a food processor. This seems to do it's job but I would still rather knead,mix and chop the old-fashioned way. It's the best part of cooking. For now I will keep this machine in the pantry for those times I am forced to resort to using it."
1,Defective out of the box,"I received this product as a Christmas present and upon its first use this morning (2 days later) it started billowing thick smoke from both sides of the engine housing. I was making a soft vegetable dip and the chopping blade turned freely at full speed, so I know that engine was not being taxed. When I called Cuisinart customer service I was informed that the unit was most likely defective and that I could take the unit to a factory authorized repair center. However, but they flatly refused to replace the defective unit. When I said I didn't want a full priced ""factory refurb"" as a Christmas present and would try to get a refund from Amazon, the representative just said ""fine -- have a happy day."" I will now try to get a refund from Amazon and will replace this unit with a different brand."
4,"Good processor, heavy duty, but a little expensive","This processor has done a great job in the two months that we've had it. Our first test was a block of sharp cheddar - which it completely shreaded in about 3-4 seconds. A softer cheese (such as Italian) takes a little longer, but still incredibly quick at about 6-8 seconds.It does a great job with everything we have put in to it, but occasionally it still leaves just a little bit of unblended food at the top. No where near the amount from other processors we've tried, but a little none the less.I would recommend this - it's been a great tool for our kitchen!"
5,Great Read,This book is a great read for all military families. Came in great condition and sooner than I expected.
3,Okay. . .,"While the author does a good job at addressing the general issues of deployment, it is lacking in specifics. All of the information in this book I had already found on different websites - for free! And much of the information about keeping your house, car, and finances are common sense. I agree with other reviewers who feel this book neglects Army families. I found that I skipped many paragraphs of the book, simply because my husband doesn't deploy for six months on a ship. On top of that, I don't like that the author suggests that as a military spouse you have chosen this lifestyle, so deal with it. I did not choose this lifestyle, and I'm sure I'm not the only spouse who was married before their soldier decided to become a soldier. I don't see how those kinds of thoughts will help you cope with deployment. So if you're looking for a general 'how to' then this is a good book. There are some good chapters, but don't look for specifics, especially if you're an Army spouse."
4,Great Software for the Money !!,"I purchased this software previously and use it often. It has been a real blessing to me. For the small price amount you will not go wrong purchasing it. The Audio Bible Drama is great for the whole family, the Virtual Hymnal is great for the Praise & Worship enthusiast who loves that Old Time Gospel, the Bible Verses program is actually a daily calender with it's own personal organizer program built right in and the Virtual Holy Land Tour is great for anyone who would love to visit the Holy Land but does'nt have the resources to do such. This software (or any other) could never take the place of actually being there, but it is worth looking at. Again, for the price this software bundle costs, I highly recomend it."
5,Rose Street Revisited,"In a time in our society when the meaning and importance of family is becoming lost, it is powerfully heartwarming to enter into the Leone family through the author's words. It is a close family who makes family a priority. Mr. Leone writes easily and with such a loving and amused perspective. He brings readers into the world of his family where they can picture the events, the people and the surroundings. The poems are poignant, the stories are warm and humorous, and the recipes and photographs remind readers that these are real people."
5,Heartwarming,"Very heartwarming, funny and sad all rolled into one. The author shows how families all pulled together. He is trying to instill all of his families values in his children growing up in these trying times."
1,a lot of useless junk,"poor and unuseable information. Not recommended. Material is too confusing for the untrained, and not enough hard data to be of use to someone skilled in engineering. A dissapointment."
2,Silent night,Was not the movie I wanted my misstake but it came on time and was packaged as it should be thoe I have not watched it so I have no opinion on this movie. silly me.Barb
5,Refreshing!!!!Addictive!,I can't get it out of my stereo. These guys will definately blow up big so get into them now so you can say you've been into them from the start!
3,Is a little watery,"I was surprised to find that this lotion is rather thin and watery. I've found that I need to reapply pretty often. It smells nice, and makes the color in my tat look nice for awhile, but the moisture doesn't last long enough. I prefer Ink Fixx Tattoo Lotion."
1,Not worth the money!!!,"First off, this is too expensive for quantity. This is pretty much a travel size bottle, you can easily get double or tipple for less. Second, it's not very moisturizing, it tends to make your tattoos dry and scaly while healing. And Thirdly, It contains an ingredient dimethicone, which is a natural rubber latex, meaning, IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO LATEX, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! The company who makes this is just trying to make money off you, you dont need this lotion!"
5,Does what it claims,"This product is free of fragrance, alcohol, and the other things one is supposed to avoid with a new tattoo. It does what it claims. If nothing else you have a good lotion. It's worth the few dollars just to ensure you look after what could be an expensive piece."
1,Not good for all types of sensitive skin.,I have friends that rave about this product. Unfortunately I found I was allergic to it and there is nothing worse then the itch of a new tattoo combined with a reaction itch.
1,Eh*... (insert shoulder shrug),"This lotion is all around terrible. From the scent to the consistancy. It's like oily lotion that feels greasy with an unpleasant smell. It would be worth it if it actually made tattoo colors more vibrant, but it fails in that department as well."
1,Hate,"I purchased this along with the salve in a tin. The salve works great and is a good moisturizer, but this is a totally different story. I've tried this now on a small tat and on 1/4 of a sleeve, and both times I thought it was awful. For me, it actually seems like it dries out the area. I have no idea how this is possible, but it literally feels dry after I rub it in. I swear by the Tattoo Goo wash, and the salve is very good, but this stuff does not work for me at all."
5,love it,i love this movie im not really into linsey lohan i dont like her very well but she was amazing in this movie and there is something for a teenage girl in this movie to lerion if u let her.
2,Beware of the Lolita Syndrome!!,"Steel Magnolia's it's NOTThis movie presents itself as one of those quirky heartwarmers about the value of family and how deep down we all really need eachother despite the generational gaps and child-rearing baggage. And to be fair, it's got a fair amount of that.However, BEFORE you idly sit through this one (esp with kids), beware that it's got some of the most lascivious sex scenes involving a minor that has ever been displayed in a public venue.I'm no prude and definitely appreciate the appropriate use or eroticism in a flick, but this one definitely caught me off guard when Lindsey sits in a rowboat, removes her panties and invites her virginal teen boyfriend to play OB/GYN.I'd say skip this one and save yourself the annoyance of verboten titillation."
2,hostile movie masquerading as a heartwarming movie,"This is a movie about a ridiculously dysfunctional family composed of morbidly dysfunctional women. There are people who actually like movies about this type of person (for whatever reason). If you are one such, fine; but if you are not, avoid this film at any price.After 100 minutes of watching them tear each other apart and blame each other for everything, abruptly in the last five minutes, all their deep psychological problems disappear without therapy or any other cause, and everybody is going to live happily ever after. Right. This cheap shot of an ending was obviously tacked on to save this movie from being a total economic disaster.Even if you're a fan of Jane Fonda or of Lindsay Lohan or both, you won't like them in this movie (unless, as I said, you like this type of movie).Bottom line: you have a better chance with almost any other movie."
2,A pathetic attempt at engendering an emotional response that fails miserably,"Georgia Rule is the story of a granddaughter sent to live with her grandmother because she acts out. The girl, Lindsay Lohan, is an aspiring Lolita who lies so convincingly that you begin to wonder if every word out of her mouth is an untruth. Her mother is an alcoholic too busy drinking and buying Louis Vuitton to take care of her daughter. The grandmother is a lonely, miserable person who tries to absolve herself of the wrongs done to her family with arbitrary rules and lackluster conversation. So let me tell you how I really feel: I've never seen a more halfhearted effort to be deep. No really. This is the story of three generations of flawed women. None of their flaws are resolved. There is no point. I can't believe I just wasted the last hour and 45 minutes of my life like this. I'll do you a favor and advise you not to do the same. Save some time. RentGlitter. At least it's funny."
1,"really hideous movie, with no redeeming features","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. That's a well-considered statement, and I make it unequivocally. And I'm 64 years old (not a fogey!) and a tremendous movie fan.It must be that the writers, directors, and actors either didn't agree on the story line, or they changed their minds too many times to go back and make it one thing or another. It's supposed to be a comedy? There aren't even that many funny lines. A soap opera? Just possibly, but very drippy. A commentary on mother-daughter relationships? on sexual abuse? on religion and faith? It's a total loss. It doesn't even pay out the title.The only possible explanation -- not justification -- of it might have been to provide a vehicle for Lindsay Lohan to act herself.I actually bought this movie! I'm as much a jerk as everyone involved in making it."
4,"Actually, Quite Good","Sometimes it's very hard to put your negative personal feelings for an actress (in this case, Lindsay Lohan) aside but she is so good in Georgia Rule that you can't help but admire her performance. So, I loved her in this movie along with Felicity Huffman and Jane Fonda who were excellent in their own right. This was so much better than I expected. It's definitely a drama but also has some humor. Yes, it deals with the very serious subject of sexual abuse with a minor but it handles it well and honestly. Was this the greatest movie ever? No. But it certainly was good to very good."
3,Not a movie for most,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a romantic drama, I am not sure where the romantic is in this movie. This movie in points disgusted me allot. Most of which was played by Lindsay Lohan, before you think of watching this movie with your family at all you need to know that there is allot of discussion on rape, alcohol and such, not something I would even watch with my brother. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because I could not give it 2 1/2 other wise I would have. Definitely a movie I will not watch again."
2,"Great Acting, Weak Script","I have never before seen a movie like this. Everything else is good except the script. Because of this, you can not really get fully into the movie. Moments that someone thought might be daring, naughty, or funny are just embarrassing. One moment is when . . . you know what? I can not say ANY of them. They are all obscene. I have a feeling the film's writers wanted these bold scenes to be cathartic and freeing. Granted, it is a fine line to cross. One movie that presented difficult situations excellently is Black Snake Moan. I recomment that instead of Georgia Rules.In Georgia Rules, Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman are fantastic. Lindsay Lohan did the best she could with the lines given her. She did not ruin the movie; the script did it for her."
4,Georgia Rules,Enjoyed the movie! We really liked the way the movie had you guessing until the very end!
