3,New Bluetooth,"This unit is priced well but still gets static at times, I shouldn't have to pay an arm & a leg to get totally clear reception and transmission but it seems thats the way it is!"
3,Performs Well,"This is my first bluetooth. It performs well as long as you are indoors or in your vehicle with the radio turned way down. When talking outdoors, the person you are talking to has extreme trouble hearing you."
2,If it does not fit you must not get!,"Please be sure to test the fit for this device. It sticks out and is very loose fitting which makes for a very uncomfortable and unsafe feeling. I keep thinking it is going to fall off, so I just remove it.I am going to put it out on Ebay to try to retrieve some of my money.I am very disappointed. Nothing else matters if you can't get the device to fit."
2,poor sound quality,"I tried this headset in several conditions; the sound quality was poor in all cases (as noted by my friends).Also, the headset seems to stick out from my ear rather than hold tight along my jaw. This may just be how it fits me personally. However, even holding the device in place did not improve perceived sound quality."
2,Returned the Headset,"I want to mention up front that this was my first headset I shortly owned. Therefore, I really didn't have anything else to compare it too. The headset was used with a Treo 650.Pro: The headset was comfortable and stylish. The sound quality received was very good.Con: At least four different people I called said that they couldn't hear me and I had to repeat myself or speak louder than normal.In the end, I returned the headset and I am now looking at the reviews to find a better one."
4,Great for RAZR V3 owners,"Either H500 owners who've had bad experiences are just more prone to write reviews or Motorola has a quality control problem on the headset line. My H500 seems to work just fine. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. It's small, it's light, AND it charges with the same mini-usb charger my RAZR V3 takes - a real advantage, as I only need to carry one charger when I travel. I really can't find anything wrong with this headset. That said, you should be overjoyed if your biggest problem this year is a faulty H500."
3,too big for small ears,"I have the H500 and it is very awkward. I believe that it was one of the first headsets to come out when the RAZR first came out. It works well with my phone but it does not fit. I chose it because at the time it looked smaller than the other headsets that were available through T-Mobile. Unfortunately, I have tried different ways to keep it on my ear but nothing works. Right now I wear it with the hook under my ear instead of over but it sticks out. It does not fit snugly against small ears. Now that there are actually smaller headsets out, I will be investing in one of those. I don't recommend this one for women because our anatomy is usually more petite than men."
2,"Comfortable, easy to use, but horribly limited range","The headset is very comfortable and has a decent battery life. Getting it to work with my phone was easy and straight-forward. Putting the headset to use was impossible. I would have to hold the phone close to my headset to get it to work. The headset would lose connection or the signal would become very weak if I had kept the phone in my pants pocket.It really can't be considered ""hands free"" if I have to hold the phone next to the headset, right? I might as well be holding it to my ear."
2,Constant Buzz Annoying,"I bought this for my husband and we have found out that while this bluetooth sounds fine on the wearer's end of the phone conversation, those on the other end of the conversation are hampered by a SIGNIFICANT ""Buzz"". It makes conversation difficult because of the constant distracting and annoying buzzing everytime it is in use. Disappointed in this product.Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset (Nickel)"
3,Motorola H500 Bluetooth,Nice addition to the hands-free cellphone environment. It is light and you hardly realize that you are actually wearing it. The only major concern I have is with the audible signal in the earpiece when receiving incoming calls. The volume is very low and you could miss an incoming call if your car radio is on at the same time. There should be a way to increase the volume in the headset for incoming calls. But it has become a very handy item.
1,Hands Free Head set,"This product seems to flop around a lot when in use. It seems hard to use also, unless i just don't know the magic secret of it's use."
3,Defective out of the box - extremely slow replacement from Motorola,"The unit I rec'd was defective out of the box. When I called Motorola customer service, I received prompt attention and a proper diagnoses of the problem. In order to get a replacement, they emailed me a fedex label and required that I return the headset to them - all PRIOR to them shipping me a new one. After 2 1/2 weeks, I called them to inquire where the replacement headset was. I was told that it had never been shipped and that a second replacement would be immediately shipped with fedex 2 day. One week later I rec'd notification that the item had been shipped and I rec'd it 4 days later. The new product does seem to work just fine.So, what's the beef? I don't mind that the original unit was defective. That happens. It just seems that it should not have taken over 3 weeks to get a replacement. That's a very long time in today's world."
2,not that great,"It never can seem to find the phone. It will work fine one day, and then the next, you can't answer with it, and it doesn't ring. And that's if it even works at all."
5,Bluetooth headset Motorola H500,"Product works well, is small, and seems to have a good range. Voice quality is good. I couldn't tell my son was using it when he called me, although I would imagine that there would be background noise if using it in a noisy environment; the microphone is sensitive."
2,Great Person to buy from - not good for Iphone,It was easy to connect to my Iphone but the quality and ability to hear well or for the other party to hear well was disappointing. I think its the I phone not the ear piece but to me bluetooth connection should be ok even with an Iphone
2,I was very disappointed.,"I was very excited to have the hands free, but people keep complaining that they can't hear/understand me. It is very frustrating. It feels loose on my ear like it might come off, but it doesn't. I guess I got too excited reading the rave reviews saying how crystal clear the sound was. The hands free in my car is better. It just didn't back up the hype.Otherwise, it works, it is pretty easy to use & very easy to set up."
4,"Clear sound, difficult controls",The good:Clear sound in a carSmall and lightEasy to connectShares a charger with other Motorola mini USB phonesThe battery life is good.Not so:Volume controls nearly impossible to locate and operate while the using - the time when you need them.Seems to have a bit of a problem picking up voice for voice-activated dialling (could be my Razr phone)So small it's easy to lose (something I managed with the first one of these I had)
2,regretfully returned,"I purchased this bluetooth headset after researching numerous options. When I opened the package, I was very pleased with the quality, size and overall appereance of this headset. When I tried it on, I was very disapointed. It just hung off my ear, not even touching my cheek. What an awful feeling. It was such a let down. I tried to see if I could adjust it in any way so it would feel semi-secure, no luck. I returned it without even setting it up with my phone. I wish it had a bendable earpiece or something. I wanted it to work very much but the poor design fit was unworkable."
1,Not loud enough - low talk time.,"I purchased this headset because it uses the same mini-usb charger that is used with my Razr phone. Unfortunately, the speaker volume on the H500 leaves something to be desired. Also, the talk time for a single charge is closer to 2 hours than 8 hours."
1,Ok for the price,"I bought this headset a couple of months ago, but I guess I was disappointed. It doesn't really stay on your ear, people on the other end have a hard time hearing you, and most of the time you can't hear them because the volume doesn't get loud enough. I would definitely go for the newer motorola model since I hear they are better. This one is OK only due to its low price, but it's worth it to spend a little extra money and get one you're actually going to use! I barely use mine anymore so I guess it was a waste of money!!!"
1,Motorola H500 Bluetooth,"The Motorola H500 Bluetooth isn't worth the package it came in! The voice activation is very poor. The volume is very poor. The control buttons are very hard to use, and it's uncomfortable. I wouldn't recomend the H500 to my worst enemy!Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones - Nickel [Motorola Retail Packaging]"
1,Malfunctioned within a few days,"On the second or third usage, I got static noise after 15-20 seconds into the call. This happened several times and also had problems pairing with my phone. I returned the product for a refund."
2,Not what I expected,"It was a reasonable price, but the noise quality was not good. I heard a bunch of static expecially when it was windy.The ear clap was not tight enough. It always felt like it was going to fall off. I had to push the ear piece closer to my ear to hear people speak. People said I sound cloudy or far away. So I just send it back."
3,maddy's review,"Whether it's legal or not in your state, Driving while talking on the phone is dangerous. Best way to reduce that danger, is to use a bluetooth.Pick up incoming calls with the touch of a finger on the device already in your ear.Outgoing calls can wait. Either until you stop at a light or pull over or get to your destination."
2,You get what you pay for,Not half as good as te #700 unit that I replaced Dont waste your money Get the higher priced unit
2,Not great,"I purchased this bluetooth for my Father In Law for fathers day to replace his old model. He thought it was fine but, when people called him they could hear an annoying buzzing in the background. He couldn't hear the noise but others could barely hear him or understand what he was saying. I called Motorola support and they tried to trouble shoot but it still didn't work. They offered to replace it but apparently they didn't have that model (don't know if it's now discontinued). They replaced it with a different model without telling me it would be refurbished. They new model was sent without a power cord for the charger. After another phone call I was sent the cord, now I have to send back the originial within 30 days or my credit card will be charged $60. It seems like alot of work for a bluetooth but for now he seems happy."
2,Sloppy and Imcomplete...,"These books vary in quality, but none is especially strong. The biggest problem is that the books don't cover the exam objectives completely. If you use these books as a primary resource in your studies, you will have some nasty surprises when you take the real test. The enclosed CD is terrible--the exam questions don't even vaguely resemble the questions on an actual Microsoft exam.I would strongly suggest that people pursuing MCSE certification buy individual titles from different publishers rather than purchasing a box set. Sybex books are generally good, many of the Test Prep books are strong as well. The quality, however, varies by title, so do a little research to avoid getting burned.The customer reviews here are generally reliable. If a book has a substantial number of overwhelmingly negative reviews, it should be avoided."
1,One of the worst book ever!,This book made me fail the exam....I had to buy another book in order topass my exams the second time. the problem is that is not accurate in the information it provides. It need s to invclude more examples and more explanations on harder topics
3,OK. But not very authentic,"This is an ok effort by Ms. Goldstein but unfortunately the recipes don't quite result in the amazing flavors that Georgian cuisine is known for. Perhaps it is Ms. Goldstein's substitutions of less authentic ingredients as some ingredients in the ""real"" dish are hard to find. Perhaps it is something else. (Her ""adjika"" is REALLY bad/wrong for instance....)OK book if you want an idea of what Georgian cuisine is like. Not good if you REALLY want the real thing..."
4,Not bad,"Not bad but I like ""The Classic Cuisine of Soviet Georgia"" better. ""The Classic Cuisine of Soviet Georgia"" is hard-cover, issued on better paper and, when it comes to recipes, seems to be a bit better organized and more useful."
3,Aclarations,"I think it is a good book, documented and interesting... but in my opinion if you are not Georgian making the recipes it's not very clear. You have to be ""quite expert in cook"" to folllow the instructions.. the steps are too simple... and also I missed some pictures about the dishes..."
3,disappointing,"I love georgian food, so I'm not in a position to be choosy about a georgian cookbook, since this seems to be the only one around. The foreword and history is more helpful than the actual recipes, though the recipe for lobio and khachapouri are tasty (I tweaked them slightly)"
3,"Solid, Professional Acoustic Folk-Rock","A solid, professional effort. She offers appropriate twee folk-rock vocals to a solid collection of songs. However, there's nothing that stands out in particular - her voice is not very distinctive - neither warm nor harsh. Her interpretations are all fine but nothing unexpected, new or interesting - all pleasant and nice. So, as long as your expectations aren't too high - it's a fine, solid and consistent sounding effort."
4,Midnight Shadow,I enjoyed reading this novel very much. It was a wonderful story and very easy to follow and look forward to reading more stories by this author.
2,DVD- Poor quality,I bought a double-feature DVD from the seller. One side of the disc played just fine. The second side had trouble reading that there was even a film to be read. I had to re-insert the DVD several times for the player to recognize the DVD. The film skipped a few times throughout the viewing and towards the end of the movie it got stuck for 20 minutes and it will not allow the rest of the film to be viewed.
3,DENZEL,"DENZEL IS TYPECAST, WHAT CAN I SAY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM PERFORM OUTSIDE OF HIS USUAL BAD GUY SCENES/"
5,At home with Tuscany in America,"My husband and I are building a Tuscan style house, and we were looking for a book to give us more ideas on design as well as decoration. This book is excellent for that. The houses are beautiful, the decoration is very tasteful, and the pictures are great. This is a great book for someone wanting to build a Tuscan style house in America. My only regret is not buying this book BEFORE beginning our project."
5,Love This Book!,"This book has excellent photos and detail. I've had this book for about 4 or 5 months and I still look through it once or twice a week. The pages seem endless! I initially looked at the book and dreamed, but now I'm seeing some tuscan and andalusion ideas come to life in my home. Great book!"
3,developing a Tuscan style,"Very nice picture book. I would have liked more information about traditional styles. How they achieved the look, what materials they used. The text was a bit annoying, I would have liked more details and less prose. By far the best book I have read is one titled Italian Rustic by Elizabeth Helman Minchilli. Use her book if you really want to know about Tuscan style."
3,Great book with lousy pictures.,"First of all, let me say this: this book is great. It has a lot of informations, with floor plans and all. But the pictures...it's so depressing. They should have hired a better photographer. The pictures of the houses in this book certainly don't reflect the beauty of the architecture. Too bad."
5,Marvelous Photos!,This book was one of the most beautiful picture books of Tuscan decorating and design I have ever seen. The photos were absolutely magnificant. Because the book was larger in design it was easier to see details. I was impressed.
4,American dream houses,"This book is beautifully presented and features some truly amazing HUGE American houses. To me it's just a bit too glossy though. The golden lighting and hosed down grounds and roads to make everything that little bit more shiny goes against the gritty, rustic, traditional houses I was looking for from Tuscany and Andalusia.If you're looking to build a house, there's some great floor plans and architectural notes though."
4,Enjoyed this experience and looking forward to our next trip,Really had fun exploring France's back roads looking for the unusual places listed here. Need to get a good map of France to find some of the off the road sites. We are planning our next holiday around the different B & B locations in this book. Better prices and more fun than a hotel.
5,Indispensable,This is a delicious and absolutely reliable guide to the delightful B&B establishments of France. I wouldn't think of traveling without it. The selected accommodations always have some unique feature or special charm.
4,"Thorough text, poor index",This is an excellent reference book with a very poorly done index. Finding what you need often requires a bit of legwork. I've begun to note topic locations myself in the margins of the index. It drives me crazy.
4,OK after a minor modification,"The net is very light weight, and on windy days it is easy to get it to lie flat because the wind passes right through.In many places I can't use the corner stakes because of sidewalks and driveway. It is difficult to spread out the tarp without using the stakes because the cord that runs around the edge like a ""purse string"" is difficult to get straight. So I made four loops of cord and attached them to the four corners, and the whole thing is much easier to handle, though you have to be careful about leakage while carrying it."
2,Not As Good As Tarping,"The concept is great but the practicality of the item is limited by the arrangement of the ropes used to close the device. They tend to twist, kink and tangle constantly and it takes longer to lay the the tarp out then it does to haul the leaves away. I work as a professional landscaper and thought I'd give it a try but it doesn't work nearly as well as a regular $18 16x 12 tarp."
4,works pretty good,"It's a good size for me to drag when it is loaded and the drawstring is convenient to keep everything together, although it takes a little foresight to make sure you don't cover the string while you are raking. I couldn't get it to lay flat enough to not trap leaves under the edge while you are raking, but it is not bad and it helped make a big job easier."
4,Good but hard to read,"This book has many great ideas but unfortunately I found the presentation very boring/tedious. Much of the book is in reply to articles written by others and things said by others, which reads like something off an internet mailing list or newsgroup. This format is okay for a short email message but is not good for something as lengthy as a book, IMO.I would still recommend this book to friends.. it introduces many ideas that challenge the traditional ""corporate farm"" which need to be heard."
1,Statistics by example only - very little theory/concepts,"After using this book for a class, we all agreed that this book was not the best for those of us who are just learning the concepts in analyzing variance. The author tends to assume the basics are ""hard-coded"" into the students head. Fair enough. His next step, however, is not to discuss the theory/concept. Rather, it is to give an example of what he is talking about, hoping you will grasp the concept. It would very helpful to have the concepts explained and then the examples given. In addition, the notation (subscripts) are not always explained, nor are the formulas obvious/straightforward. Finally, the book has editing problems.A better editor and supplementary manuals (step-by-step explanation of concepts and formulas, SPSS instruction, etc.) would be a big help.My recommendation would be to find another book from which you will learn statistics."
1,BEST LAXATIVE EVARRRR!!!,Whew! Finally off the pot. This stuff will cleanse your digestive system with the quickness!I felt as though i was prepping for a colonoscopy for 4 days until I stopped using it.Everything is back to normal now thank God but.. I will not use any again. Still have several pounds of it left. any takers?
5,Los inicios de punk,La cosa es simple: Nadir's es el primer disco de música punk en la historia del rock.
4,One of the better albums to emerge from the '70's...,"It's little wonder that rabid fans of Hammill regard ""Nadir's Big Chance"" as one of his lesser efforts. NBC is a major departure for Hammill as it ROCKS! Sometimes Hammill could come off as a bit pretentious and bombastic. NOT HERE! Great tunes, accessible lyrics and terrific playing (by VDGG, no less) make this Hammill's most consistantly enjoyable release. Not for ""Room Temperature"" fans. If you get off on great pop/rock music with a touch of punk thrown in for good measure, you can't do much better than this.Now if he'd only do a followup..."
4,Intelligence hits the garage,"Peter Hammill, angst-driven rock commentator with more demonds on hand than the Catholic church, here takes run at the iconic status of rock and roll. This 1975 album, featuring Hammill's grungy alter-ego of Rikki Nadir, puts out a call to ""smash the system with a song"" -- with the surprising result that many of the following wave of UK punk rockers quoted this as an influence. While a rocking set, Hammill could not suppress his intelligence enough to avoid moments of fascinating lyricism, razor-sharp satire and musical invention. More than adequate support from regulars Hugh Banton, Dave Jackson and Guy Evans bring the dark musical fantasies to life, from Nadir's declaration of intent to Nadir's dissolute finish.Steven McDonald END"
5,Travel Wonder,"This router is great! I bought this router so that I could watch TV and work at the same time when I am stuck in a hotel with a wired connection. Easy to use. Just connect to the internet via an ethernet cable (provided) and power the unit. Switch to position 1 and it allows just one computer to connect wirelessly, switch to position 2 and it allows multiple computers to connect. Accessing the router is easy and the setup is intuitive and only necessary if you want to restrict access via MAC address or encryption. Netgear has a firmware update for this router that allows WPA encryption. I have found this router to be very useful when I have meetings and several people (up to about 10 computers) want to access the Net. Just one thing. This router can not be connected directly to a DSL modem. If you have a router at home you can connect to one of the ports but it will not work when connected directly to a DSL modem."
4,a heartwarming Christmas story.. great cast!,"I remember this movie from my childhood, I have searched hi and lo, Johnny Whitaker was a child actor who could be as bad as Tom Sawyer and then a truly ""Little Angel"" in his dirty robe and disheveled halo! Fred Gwynn as Patience, it was a wonderful part of our holidays for many years! I am excited to have found it!!!"
3,The Littlest Angel,It was okay. Don't expect it to be the same as the book. I'm still having trouble with the image of Herman Munster (Fred Gwynne) as the angel.
3,Johny Whitaker as,"I am also looking for the movie with Johny Whitaker called ""The Littlest Angel"". I can't seem to find anywhere! Anyone have any ideas? Thanks"
3,"A Memory, Not A Classic","The last couple of Christmas seasons I contemplated ordering this, knowing that it's 40 years old and I was like 7 when it first aired on TV. But the nostalgia beckoned and won, so I ordered it last Christmas. I wasn't let down, nor was I overly wrought with joy upon viewing. But the video was in good shape and the attempts at special effects humorous. This is NOT a product for someone looking for a modern day Christmas DVD. It IS a good piece of nostalgia for those who remember this airing back in the day. Also, for those who are really uptight about their Bible and scripture, this product will probably annoy you, but then, everything does, doesn't it?"
3,The Littlest Angel,"I remembered liking this when I was little, but as I watched it again it is ok. I like the story line, but I just don't like having so much singing, which wasn't that great. I like musicals but this one is not that great. It would of been better if they cut down on the singing,"
3,very good,I am looking for an old black/white version (?) of the littlest angel that I saw as a child with Johnny Whitaker playing the little angel. Can you help me locate?
1,STILL WISHING & HOPING,"I ORDERED THE SCREEN VERSION OF THE LITTLEST ANGEL WITH JOHNNYWHITTAKER AND FRED GWYNN, HOWEVER I RECEIVED THE CARTOON VERSION. WHILE I AM SURE THE CARTOON VERSION IS WONDERFUL, I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE SCREEN VERSION. I HOPE THE PRODUCERS OF THIS FILM RECOGNIZE THE POPULARITY OF THIS VERSION AND RE-RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSION SOON. THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO PURCHASE THIS VIDEO. IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS A COPY AND WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE A COPY PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ""MANY"" YEARS AND WOULD LOVE A COPY."
1,Wrong movie.,"Cute movie, but this isn't the movie I ordered. However, it would cost me more to ship it back than it originally cost. Again, cute movie, but it is not the one I wanted."
1,This woman is a wacko-nutsy-crackpot,"One of my dear friends is religious an I was babysitting her children so she could go see a movie. I'm always interested in what other people were reading and I laughed when I saw the title in her bookshelf. Yet I could not put the book down - much like craning one's neck to see a fatality accident. This ""doctor"" believes women should embrace, love and adore their bloating, cramping, stained clothing, mood swings, nausea, breakouts, headaches and overall irritibleness otherwise - we just wouldn't be real women. Does that strike anyone else as utter and complete nuttery??? It's like telling a holocaust victim that thier experiences built character. What a crackpot! The book had a very evangelical agenda if you ask me. The book left me completely disgusted and unconvinced so I'll continue to get depo-provera shot every 3 months and enjoy my menstrual and pain free life."
5,Sweet Lightsaber!,"This is a realy cool verson of Vader's lightsaber.It extends to over 60cm!It also has very cool sounds that are motion activated!When you move it from side to side,it makes the cool ""woosh"" sound.And when it makes contact with another object,it makes the ""clash""sound.When you turn it on,the blade lights up,and it makes the signature lightsaber humming sound!This is a very cool and afordable lightsaber,suitable for all fans of Star Wars."
1,BURY THIS MOVIE WITH THE BONE!,"""THE DOGS ARENT THE ONLY THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE THAT BITES!"" IT STRANGELY REMINESCENT OF THOSE CHEESY B-MOVIES THEY WATCH ON THAT SHOW ""MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000"", WITHOUT THE ENTERTAINING SIDE COMMENTARY. WHOEVER MADE THIS FILM SHOULD BE MADE TO SuFFER THE SAME FATE AS ALL THE PEOPLE OF THAT BACK-WOOD HICK TOWN THAT LET A PACK OF LIKE 6 ROTTWEILERS KILL ALMOST 2 DOZEN PEOPLE. IN SHORT, IF I EVER UNSHEATH THIS HORROR AGAIN ILL PROBABLY END UP LOCKING MYSELF IN A ROOM FULL OF RABID DOGS JUST TO GET RELIEF FROM IT. OH AND BY THE WAY.I CHECKED WITH SISKELL N EBERT, PEN AND TELLER, AND JAYE N SILENT BOB..THEY ALL AGREED THAT ""THIS FILM BITES!"""
5,A Must Read,"The guidelines put forth by the author are a perfect guide to amassing wealth. I can't imaging how difficult it must have been for the author to coem to this country with nothing. He is to be commended not only for his success, but also for trying to help others who come here in the same situation."
5,Just what I needed,"A Clean shot gun is a happy shot gun. Good kit, for basic cleaning. It came in a little under a week."
2,Brush not included,Item description states brush included box states no brush. I should have just paid a little more and got a complete kit. Not a bad kit for using three maybe four times before you run out of patches depending on gun use. If you order this kit make sure to get some more patches a brush and a mop type brush.
1,Not exact product I ordered,"I felt its just like a base item, I ordered a perfumed new product,but I received a non-perfumed item.Its just too expensive comopare to other local store.I never go with amazon for these type of items.But its fast shipping . Too pricy"
5,By Far the Best Travel Book on the Dominican Republic,"If you're going to the Dominican Republic you've got to use this book. I brought four different books with me on my trip to the Dominican Republic and this was the one that I found was by far the most accurate. It had great, honest coverage of the all-inclusive hotels, comprehensive coverage of all the major tourism areas, like Santo Domingo's colonial district, Puerto Plata, Punta Cana, Cabarete etc. But what was most helpful were the terrific recommendations for sights to see that weren't in any other guidebook. My husband and I were able to explore Taino caves that have depictions of Christopher Columbus' three ships. These caves were in the middle of a wilderness national park and no other guide book even knew that they existed. Also by far the best restaurant and bar recommendations. Highly recommended."
4,"Been there, Used it, Helped me","Bought this book BEFORE my first trip to the DR in Sept. 2001 (yes just after the WTC attacks) and it made life ever so much easier to get around there (as well as research via internet). Easy to read and extremely helpful tips. Please note: Since the WTC attacks, life is much different in the DR and business is down considerably. One of our party stayed there for nearly two months and said the incidence of people carrying guns was higher, more noticeable although he noticed no extra crime or violence. Staying in the resorts is very safe (he stayed in small hotel outside resorts), still, although tourists are staying away right now. This book will help you in your travels!"
4,cute counting & rhyming story,"This story is fun to sing along as I read it to my daughter. I like stories that flow well and this one does for the most part with a few bumps, but nothing to trash the book over. The subject matter is adorable for preschool age children - what's more fun than partying mice?"
2,Not a good kids' book,"I just finished reading this book to my son for the first time. It pretty much stinks as a kids book, in my opinion. It's too abstract to make sense for little kids (12 mice coming out of and going back into a clock?). And while the story rhymes, it doesn't really go along well with what's actually happening in the pictures, leading my son to constantly have to ask what was going on. I recommend a pass on this book."
2,not impressed,Story line is hard to follow.I read it once to my class and gave the book away (to a child who might enjoy looking at the pictures).Sidenote: Elementary students know few if any of the dances mentioned.
2,"Fine for 1997, but boring in 2006","Reissues can be tricky. Some are just wonderful. I love reading Mary Balogh's or Jo Beverly's reissues because they write timeless storylines and truly powerful books no matter when they are published. This one, however, pales 9 years after it was first published. The endless plotline with Bonaparte, French spying, and smuggled goods has been done to death. If Enoch had done some editing before this was reissued and reduced all the extra ""intrigue"", the book would have been much better. The relationship between Kit and Alex is still good. But, it takes soooo long for anything to happen between them. I got bored long before they develop any kind of relationship. Skimming 2/3 of the book was frustrating. I feel thoroughly dissatisfied with the money I spent on this one."
3,meh,"I wanted to like this because the premise was interesting, but there was just not enough insight into the motivations of the characters, or even the points along the way in the plot. The hero was especially unexplained... rake reformed, but why? Could have made better use of the chapters from his POV. The heroine was better. She started out kind of plucky and we understand that she's attracted to the hero, but then she didn't develop much. For example, okay, she's scared of actually having to act like a woman, but bam, put her in a dress and no problem, she's the belle of the ball! And did she love her father or not? For that matter, did HE love her or not? The gift at the end indicates yes, but it was barely explained. There were lots of little snippets thrown in to explain WHY things were the way they were (why her father was so bitter, why she had to dress up as a boy), but they always felt a bit hasty."
3,Argh - - - didn't realize this was reissue!,"I'm about 2/3 way through this book, and so far it is boring (as another reviewer commented) and not very sexy. The worst part is that there is very little character development of Kit and Alex... so you just don't care that much about them. It's also very hard to understand what Alex sees in Kit; she is an obnoxious, unkind young woman who has lived like a man for the past 3+ years. She's obviously up to no good (a spy), and is not even that interesting. How is this gorgeous, intelligent man drawn to her? Maybe it's shopping together for men's clothing (?????) or choosing female dancing partners at a soiree (????) or lending her a neckcloth (???). I just don't get it. And this was disappointing since I LOVE Suzanne Enoch. I guess I just will avoid her older books (or expect much less from them). I will also pay more attention to ""reissue"" vs. ""new release""!"
2,Did not finish,"My biggest problem with this book was the heroine, Kit. Found her too obnoxious. I couldn't figure out exactly what Alex saw in her- at all. I also found it incredible that with all her cleverness, she didn't know what her father had been smuggling into France. Really?She is so good at getting into locked rooms, but no curiosity or means to find about what her father smuggles? She is at Alex's house, spying on him and his friends, eating his food, getting money for clothes and what not, traitor to her country and acts the complete Brat, calling him, ox, pig, and whatnot. I couldn't stomach her anymore after a 150 pages."
2,I found it boring,I am not reading these books for the plots. Who cares about smuggling and treason? Where was the sex??? Am I going to have to start writing these novels just to get some steamy passages back into the storyline?
2,Boring...,I'm in the middle of the book and so far I haven't hit upon a bit of romance. Isn't a romance book supposed to be romantic? The premise is a girl who passes for a man so well that not even his (her) closest friends detect she's a he. Totally unbelievable that a woman could be as beautiful as the book claims and still be able to fool even the closest friends into thinking she is a man... and not a sissy man either.I'm only half way through the book after a week because every time I read it I fall asleep. I would not recommend this book. Maybe back when it was originally written that type of story sold but not anymore. And for heaven sake... when do we get to the romance??? I don't think I'll finish this book. What a shame because it wasn't cheap.
3,Too long,"I've read several Suzanne Enoch books and really, really enjoyed them. This one? Not so much. I think it would have been a much better story if it had been shorter. It takes forever for anything to happen. But the thing that really bothered me is the so-called ""French"" dialogue. I'm French. Some of the things Kit says... I couldn't even figure out what she meant. No sentence was well written. And when at one point someone says ""Baisez-moi encore"", supposedly meaning ""Kiss me again"" well... If you speak French you'll understand that I can't fathom how come she or her publisher didn't bother ask someone who could actually speak French to proof read.If this is the first Enoch book you've read, give another one a try."
1,Not as advertised,"Advertise sizes that you will NOT receive if you order this item. The shipping on this heavy item means you're not going to send it back, so you get cheated. DON'T BUY!"
2,Boring.,"I have never come across a review that has given a correct plot of this book .THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GRYPHON THAT HAPPENS TO BE BLACK SITTING AROUND AND GETTING HEALED!That ,is the plot .This book is the most pointless and boring book ever .If you want good fantasy ,try Terry Brooks ,or Andre Norton .This book is a waste of reading time."
1,An absolute disgrace to fantasy.,"Allright,why does everybody like this book?It had character detail,sure,but it doesn't even get anywhere.No great battle between good and evil,no quest,practically no magic.That isn't what fantasy is supposed to be like!It is supposed to have amazing detail in magic,a wonderful conflict,and maybe something of a quest.This book,you could say,was about a gryphon,sitting around,and gradually getting healed,and about fuzzy little relationships in a war camp.This lasts for about until the end of the book.Why?Why couldn't it get somewhere and become interesting?I could tell by Lackey's style that she has the capacity to do that.However,she writes quite well with Norton in Elvenbane,so don't turn away from those .And if you're somebody who likes books that get somewhere,try Shannara,Fionavar Tapestry,or Riftwar or something.Do not read this."
1,"SIMPLE PLOT, SAPPY CHARACTERS","The plot in this book is very, very simple. Also, there is almost no action to move the story along - and I don't mean just battles etc. I good story has to move along and this one stagnates. The characters and writing style is very sappy. This writer needs to learn how to write a story by showing more then telling. They just simply tell everything. Very poorly written from that regard. One thing good about this book is the fact that the birds were fairly believable. The ending was good in some ways, and terrible in other ways. The antagonist was barely known throughout the book and his conclusion was almost nothing. If you like romance novels, you might like this book. But I prefer better writing than that. Read David Gemmell, then compare his writing to this book."
1,Days of Our Lives!!,"I just don't get it! The whole book doesn't make sense. This is a boring book revolving around some weird [adult] fantasy the authors have about therapists/clients and they try and get the reader involved with it. It rambles from one position to another and revolves around life in a camp. The camp life became so boring I was hoping there was a printing fault and all the pages slowly became blank. This book is about relationships FULL STOP! The fantasy part involves some flying bird things and it has no bad guy of any consequence. It's more like Days of Our Lives with a little magic thrown. If you buy it second hand for 99cents then you have paid 99cents plus postage too much. If I had got this book from the library instead of paying for it, I would not have bothered finishing it. There are only two books that I have paid for and not finished reading Wheel of Time (Book 1) and Althalus. Honestly this book is horrendous."
4,"interesting, yet confusing","i have always been a big mercedes lackey fan(yeah). i truly enjoy reading about valdemar and all the other places that her stories take place in. i was excited when this book came out, but when i started to read it, i got confused. the way she writes the book, makes it seem as though we should already know half of what is going on. it should be a second book, not a first. but despite all that, it was a slamming book, and misty has done it again!!!!"
5,Simply amazing.,"Misty's done a grand job with this one. The nonhuman characters--namingly, Skan, Zhaneel, Aubri, and Gesten--are all given such believable that those who frown on nonhuman characters will have to change their views after reading it. I couldn't put the book down help but cry. It's marvelously done, and Larry Dixon's beautiful illustrations fix the characters more firmly in the reader's mind. I highly reccommend this book to any and all fantasy fans."
5,G.I.B.(Gryphon in Black),"You'll laugh, yuo'll cry, you'll kiss six bucks good-bye, if you buy this book. It is positively delightful. Lackey must have been ripping her hair to shreds to get it right. You'll like it even if you don't like fantasy. This is a book that you will not regret spending your lunch money on. You will read it to bits out of love for it. I gaurentee it!"
2,But why?,"This is the fantasy novel equivalent of a ""chick flick"". The true focus of the story is not the war between Maar and Urtho, but the personal travails and relationships of a therapist and his clients set against a fantasy backdrop. If you go in for such relationshippy stuff, this is a book for you (indeed, Mercedes Lackey excels at this kind of writing). To me, it seems a waste of the fantasy genre. Consider: human relationships are real, magic is not. Hence, it is possible to write about human relationships in a real-world setting without losing anything. But fantasy is meant to provide escapist fun or, at most, reflections on life, the universe etc. neatly packaged and disguised with lots of escapist fun. What other purpose is served by putting in the fantastic? As a fantasy, The Black Gryphon fails to deliver."
5,A high schooler's viewpoint,"As a high school student, I'm always being told to do more reading. When I heard about this trilogy I thought I would give it a try... well it was by far worth it! With the complex characters, amazing plot and just detailed writing, this book is definitely a 5 out of 5!"
4,What are you looking for?,"This is a touching story about a band of fighters and their relationships with each other, for good and bad. The plot often drags, but overall the people and dialog (internal and external) are what give the story a purpose. I loved the humor and camaraderie in the relationships. I delighted in the struggles with inadequacies and triumph over internal demons and outside betrayal. I enjoyed the moral ponderings. These things are what I was looking for in this book - the things I have come to know and expect from the author.The fact that this trilogy is called ""The Mage Wars"" is highly misleading unless you consider it a definition of an era. The Black Gryphon, like many Lackey books, is definitely character driven. The war is a setting, not the plot. So for those looking for a great battle of might and magic, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Other authors, other series, or even later on in the Velgarth books."
3,An excellent begining to the Mage Wars tiology.,"The book was written well. The details in the opinion of this author were great. The cretures were well thought out. It was almost like being there. The only drawback was the ending, but you'll have to read it to find out"
5,Pre History of Valdemar,"For every one that loves a prequal, also this is the start of an excelent series in its own right. The Charatures are so well structured that you can see why they are still remembered by Valdemar, at least in myth, 1000 years on."
3,"""Born In East LA"" and the last of Cheech & Chong until 1997","Cheech & Chong officially split after they appeared in AFTER HOURS (1985). It wasn't until 1997 (12 years later) during the ""Wild Card"" episode of the CBS tv series ""Nash Bridges"" did they reunite in a professional way. This Cheech & Chong ""Get Out Of My Room"" (1985) is all recorded on professional video. It plays like a documentary where Cheech wants to do a music video ""Get Out Of My Room"", but Chong just wants to talk to girls. Actually, this is Richard ""Cheech"" Marin's first time as Director. ""Elvira"" Cassandra Peterson has a cameo appearance as well as Beverly D'Angelo and Jan Michael Vincent. Includes the hit video ""Born In East LA"" which was a take-off from the original tune ""Born In The USA"" by Bruce Springsteen. Both Cheech Marin and Bruce Springsteen have credit for ""Born In East LA"". The weird ""Love Is Strange"" video also included in this video."
3,not a stand alone comedy cd,"This is taken from a film so it's not really a comedy cd like their other cd efforts. So it's not fair to judge it on that level , it's like a soundtrack really. If you are expecting a straight on comedy cd then you will not be happy with this one. I collect all their stuff so I am ok with this but obviously the one star reviewer didn't understand this. This is a good soundtrack though that is interesting in it's own way. I hear it's on dvd somewhere. If you want a comedy cd from these guys grab 'cheech and chong' , 'sleeping beauty' 'los chonchinos' ,'wedding album' 'lets do a new dope deal', 'big bambu' , those are stand alone comedy cds. But if you have those you will want this to be part of your collection to because it's still funny in places."
1,BAD ITEM,"this charger did NOT work for my samsung A707 as advertised. as soon as i plugged it in... it sent the cellphone in an endless boot cyle. would turn it off, then once it turned back on would turn it off again.BAD! would not recommend.. spend extra couple dollars and buy an OEM manufacture's charger."
4,wow,this guy is amazing. how can he go un noticed? his voice is just so so husky and deep you can't go wrong man!!!!
4,real cool jams,this is a winning hand if you are looking to get in on the funk collecton tip. the kind of jams that you will groove to and can play cards to and enjoy a Kool-Aid flavored cook out party. right on time jams here.
5,Fantastic window in to the Bad Brains live..........,"The album perfectly captures the Bad Brains live. And the Bad Brains live are a sight and sound to behold.....at least they were. This album captures the very best spirit of those remarkable times. I was there in the mid-80's, watching HR dive off stacks of Marshall amps and then ripping the audience in half with the raw power that the Bad Brains once were.Youth Are Getting Restless: Live in Amsterdam is a must-have for anyone looking to add the live essence of one of the greatest bands who has ever lived."
4,punk reggae,"This is the Bad Brains disc you want to put between your Ramones and Fugazi cd's at home. Awesome live disc recorded in Amsterdam, and roughly 17 of their best songs too. True, you cant always understand what HR is saying, but who cares. The music is fast and furious. Three of the tracks, 5, 10, and 15, are basically cool reggae jams. Everything else is played as fast as these guys can possibly play it. If rasta flavored punk sounds good to you, don't pass this up. If you want to check out one of their studio albums, go with ""Bad Brains"", or ""I against I"". If you want the reggae without the punk, check out one of HR's solo discs."
5,"The ""Brains Are Restless""!!","Love it!!I'm a true blue Brains fan and i could listen to this album all day.Ever hear of wearing out a cd? The band and music is tight, mixed in with the explosive voice of HR, make this a cd that you shouldn't be without.As usual you have to listen to the Brains real loud with no disturbances.If you're a Brains freak like i am buy this cd now, and when you listen to this cd you will become ""restless"" and want to thrash!!"
4,4 & 1/2 stars,Please remove all breakable objects within 50 yards of your stereo before playing this disc. If you are a punk fan you will go absolutely nuts upon hearing this albumn. This might be Bad Brains best record. I can't say enough good things about this disc. My only beef is that it didn't include the track I against I.
1,Do NOT buy!,"Interesting toy, my baby likes to chase, and likes the music and noises it makes. But it is a safety hazard! When the button to make it move is pushed while child is holding it, moving wheel bar has groove big enough for child's finger to be inserted, and finger is then pinched between plastic and metal rivet holding bar, causing laceration. I have contacted Consumer Product Safety (Canada) to inform them of the danger this toy presents."
2,Doesn't work on Windows XP,"My son plays this at the library so I thought it would be the perfect thing to have on our vacation. Unfortunately, it only works on older versions of Windows and Macs. If you have a new computer running Windows 2000 or later, don't expect this to work."
2,"""New stereo recordings by the original artists. Recorded in 2002.""","Beware. These are not the original hits, but (as it says in fine print on the back cover) ""New stereo recordings by the original artists. Recorded in 2002."" Now, the new stereo recordings themselves may be fine. I don't know. Because I'm not opening this one. Sending it back to get the ""Greatest Hits"" instead. Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes deserve to have more than just these two collections available, don't you think?"
5,Beautiful soundtrack,"Yasunori Mitsuda doesn't disappoint in the least with this gorgeous, unrestricted soundtrack to The Seventh Seal (which I have not played). The first track, The Door, truly stands out in a very consistent and enthralling album, though the final track, Reincarnation, is also worth mentioning. It's lively without being bombastic, which makes it good for both easy and focused listening. It comes in at under forty minutes, so it leaves me wishing there was a little more music, but Naoko Endo's piano score (not included) complements this very well. Overall, it's an excellent effort from one of the most accomplished video game music composers to date."
4,Great Title by Yasunori Mitsuda,"I did not know this was a video game sound track the first time I heard it.Yasunori Mitsuda never fails to impress me.As a child I was exposed to his early discography through SNES games, and as I got older I downloaded everything I could find with his name on it as availability has become more common.In my late 20's and early 30's I'm buying up all the DLC rights to bodies of work that I ended up downloading for free in my younger years when money was more of a problem."
4,Interesting observations on industry directions.,"This book has thought-provoking comments on the future configuration and incentives in the industry. Klenke is a clear beleiver in Star's 80's observations, but so are many who are watching his predictions come true.The book drags at times but, overall, a must read!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"This is a good album, not a great one. When compared to some of Wyatt's later works such as Dondestan or Old Rottenhat this recording sounds like an artist maturing, evolving, but not yet at the height of his creative abilities. This disc presents an artist of considerable talent in the midst of transition from the complexities of Soft Machine and Matching Mole to the minimalist brilliance that he was to assume in later works. The accompanying musicians are solid but not quite capable of assuming a voice equal to that of the composer's. This is a more jazz influenced recording than much of his other solo work. Still worth purchasing but not essential...Simon."
5,Awesome product,These are great. Sometimes with silky waistbands they slip. I would've liked to have these earlier. They're perfect for in between sizes and low riders.
2,Probably good for tall people,"My torso is too short for this product. The bands are loose when I fasten them, so they don't really keep my pants up. Plus they're a pain to fasten and unfasten every time I use the bathroom - which is a lot!"
2,Belly Ups so so,"I thought they were great at first, by about the seventh use they just didn't seem to clamp as well and always popping off. I still use them because an occational mishap is better than constantly pulling up my maternity pants!! I'm still looking for something better, if anyone has any suggestions?!"
2,Poor quality,"I have used it only twice and it is already distorted and does not hold anymore. It is very poor quality and also it is not adjustable. I was using Y-back suspenders, but it can be seen when I wear wide-collar shirts and also hurts my shoulders. So I thought belly ups is a great idea when I bought it. It should have been adjustable and durable."
4,Venom's Back,"Finally a good Venom story. Here's some pros and cons...PROS:1. Eddie Brock is now more sympathetic; we see why he REALLY hates Spider-Man now, and it makes more sense.2. If you knew nothing about Venom before this story, you wouldn't be lost. Everything is fleshed out well and I can almost say that this is Venom's ""Killing Joke"" story - definitive.CONS:1. Ya know.. the art is cool and all, but does Venom HAVE to be so huge? Ramos once drew a picture of Spidey and Venom fighting for a WIZARD magazine special and Venom looked right. Here... I dunno.2. *SPOILER* The whole ""A child grows within me"" thing seemed pointless to me. It came out of nowhere. I guess that adds to the whole reason for its need for survival, but c'mon, Venom has had like 6 kids by this point. We have yet to see this new offspring and hopefully we won't anytime soon.Thanks for reading... Hope I was of some help."
5,Beautiful!,"Bought this line for my entire kitchen, dining room, living room,entry and hallway. They are of excellent quality, heavy and theantique bronze finish is perfect! SO happy with them as usual withpurchases from Amazon. They fit so well with antique or country decorand one room is a little 'Italian' and the finish is perfect in thereas well. Very happy with these and glad I finally broke down and madethe change in all these rooms with the switch and socket covers!!"
3,Could W.I.T.C.H be Blaahhh?,"I agree with the last person who wrote a review- book #13 was definately filler. I think that this book was a ton better, but it was still rather odd and confusing, especially for younger readers. I didn't totally understand the whole thing about the Auramure, and Cornelia's constant sulking is getting on my nerves, so, yeah. She needs to get over herself . . . she's obsessed with a flower . . .Well, all I can say is, the books seem to be getting less and less exciting. Less is happening-the books are getting stretched out with one event! It seems like half the book is reviewing the past, a quarter is filler, and the remaining quarter is a storyline.I feel like the only thing I can look forward to with this series is the comics, and . . . that one little quarter of storyline.Really? I advise buying the Graphic novels. ; )"
2,This Makes No Senses,"Ever since Elyon beat Phobos, the books are bor-ring!!!!! What is Auramere? Why did the Araumere get sucked into Cornelia? Are the girls powerful now that Cornelia contanes thier powers? The discription said, ""The powerful beings in have once agian turned their attention to Will, Irma, TAranee, Cornelia, and HAy Lin. They are disturbed to see the group fighting and splintering under pressure. Taking it upon herself to punish the girls, Luba sets a trap that ends up horribly wrong. With each girl trapped in a world of their own, there is no stopping Luba or the powerful being she has created."" Unless my book is missing a few pages, they are not trapped in their own world! The other reviewers are right. Kate Egan (author) is a liar!"
5,"Aah, Lavender!","Great smelling hand soap; cleans great & rinses well; nice looking bottle. Love the fact that it's not tested on animals and is biodegradable, as are all Method products!"
4,Nice costume,"My husband, son and I got pirate costumes for our vacation and for future Halloween use. Being a plus size, it's hard finding good quality costumes. This pirate lady costume was great overall. The single black piece was very roomy & the quality was very good as well. My only complaint is the corset was smaller and not very roomy (for a 2x). Although I let out the ties, it was still too tight and would not stay put. But for the price and quality still a great deal."
1,Horrible - Lousy - Junk - Cheap - Don't buy,"DON'T buy this overpriced piece of junk cellophane. I can't believe they sell this stuff. I was taken in by the advertising. First of all it is not crystal clear. Second, I had bubbles under it and could not get them out. I tried to carefully take it back off to maybe get the stubborn air bubbles out and I could not, then I got a finger print on the sticky side and it showed thru in addition to being bent out of shape when I tried to peel it off.Results, in the trash it went. Just buy the cheap covering. It works just as well and you can replace it often.Advice: stay away from this very expensive overpriced piece of plastic. You will not be happy. I wasted almost $20 on it with postage that was $4.95 to mail something that weighed what a piece of toilet paper weighed.Is it possible to give a negative rating?"
2,A real pain,"While I don't doubt this product protects well, it is an absolute NIGHTMARE to apply. I tryed this product 3 different times thinking I would get it perfect this time and each time it was horrible to put on. I can't possibly recommend this to anyone.First, you have to get it WET to put it on. Is there anyone else who thinks there is something wrong with getting your electronics wet in order to protect it?Second, dust draws to this thing like a magnet (and I chose the most dust free place I could find.) Once the dust is under there, forget it, it really does look bad.You have to wait 24 hours to use your product after applying it. I imagine this is really to allow any liquid traped inside your gaget to dry. Not a pleasant thought.After 3 bad experiences, I am looking elsewhere."
1,Ugh. Don't ever ever put this on your device.,"Applied this to my 60gb ipod w/video and it was a flawless application. It wore well for three years and I noticed that one of the tabs along the top was loose and wouldn't restick, so I tried to remove the invisibleshield exactly how they recommended in their FAQs. Well, I'm screwed now because this ipod, which my husband gave me as a wedding present, has thick goo covering the front part and no amount of cleaning or scrubbing or using cleaners will remove it. I can't put a new cover over it and the screen is impossible to see. It's very disheartening to lose something that had sentimental value like this. [...]"
4,Tough and Tough,"Invisible Shield is very tough as advertised. It is a little tough to put on and look invisible. Maybe I have better luck on my next application, as I will buy this for other electronics. Beware if you have Ipod docks with tight tolerances this shield could make it too fat to fit.This is a great product but be very careful during application."
3,Better than most of the other protections but...,"I wanted to give my iPod 30Gb to my girlfriend for her birthday and I ordered an Invisible Shield in order to get a new and clean protection for it. My iPod was not new, and even if I took care of it as much as I could since I bought it, there was some imperfections on the back, but the front was good as new.The InvisibleShield is very painful to set up, you will have to get rid of every possible dust that may mess around with your device, or you will end up with some horrible bubbles under the shield. After I set it up, I waited for about 10 hours for the result. On the front, the shield was very nicely set up, no microbubbles or whatsoever. But, the back of the iPod wasn't as clean as the front and I have now 4 or 5 bubbles that (I think) will never disappear.So, to conclude, if you plan to buy an InvisibleShield, set it up on a brand new iPod and it will be perfect, otherwise you will end up like me : not very satisfied."
1,Junk,"I found this impossible to apply to my device. No matter what I tried -- and yes, I followed the instructions to the letter and even watched the instructional video on YouTube -- there were bubbles under the plastic. While the larger bubbles could be ""squeegeed"" out, the small bubbles could not. Having even one tiny bubble in the middle of your video screen makes for a lousy viewing or reading experience.This is a waste of money."
4,Classic review of ICE fundamentals and related air pollutant,"Provides a clear, concise review of internal combustion engine fundamentals, circa early 1970's. Many of the trending charts and analytical methods presented are referenced in current texts, making this almost a must-have. The classic nature of the text makes it an easier read, as well."
4,Book for nerds,"What can I tell you, this book is highly technical. You have to be a geek to like this one..."
5,perfect!,Never made a cheesecake before this pan and it makes it SO EASY! Very Satisfied. Its also super easy to clean!
2,poor quality,"To light and the out layer would be cut even with a plan cake knife, I just hope a little sting won't affact the ability of stick-proof. One thing more, it is not easy to clean at all. Only fair thing is the neckle ceals good,"
4,Things to think about,"I read this book. For those that rated it negativily, I think you missed the point. It was thought provoking and an easy read. Yes she had failed marriages, but then she realized she had not asked herself the questions that she asks in the book. The book is not for everyone. I am in a happy marriage but I was curious to see what other issues I may have missed. I think that it is a good starting off point for asking yourself what marriage means to you?, and is your marriage one that will survive? With that said I am going to share this book with other people in my life that I feel may beneifit from having the seeds planted in thier head. At the end of the day, you either want to buy it or not. Good Luck."
5,"Great for newlyweds, or those engaged","As a new wife, I was having wedding magazine withdrawal on our honeymoon, and read how well this is doing on the NY Times Bestseller list, so I went and picked it up. I read it on the beach and have really enjoyed it so far. I feel it is a great book to get if you are part of an engaged couple who don't have the time or money for pre-marital counseling, or a newlywed couple. It helps to make the intentions of vows a reality in your married life. It includes exercises you and your partner can do that really open up discussion, and at the end of the book has a ton of questions you need to ask each other. It's pretty comprehensive, even helping you to write vows, to choose officiants, or to plan a vow renewal ceremony. The amazon.com price is also the best out there, since the book is still only offered in hardback. Read and better your relationship - can't ask for more."
4,Lacks spiritual depth.,Some good points but lacks the biggest ingredient in a good marriage--forgiveness and prayer on a daily basis together.
3,Good info but not well written,"Dr. Smith has great points in this book but the writing is just a little too effusive for my taste - I had a hard time comprehending the point of some of her sentences, and others I wanted to say 'okay, okay, I get it already.'The checklists are interesting and the overall concept is great. I like Dr. Smith when I've seen her on Oprah, I think she was just trying too hard in some places in the book. But that's not the worst thing in the world!"
3,the Truth,This book shared various experiences of couples and their lies at the alter. This is a good book but I think it would have been better with some Bible scriptures to back up her beliefs and understandings. Not all adult behaviors are from a childhood insecurity. Just my opinion.
3,Overrated by Oprah??,"I know the author of this book is a friend of Oprah's, but that doesn't make the book as good as it was said to be. There are some good points in the book, and the list of questions at the back are good talking points; however, there are some issues that need to be noted. First, the book is totally female-centric - as if women can do no wrong and all our problems stem from men, which just is not true. So readers should be aware that the slant is totally pro-female and somewhat anti-male. Second, the list of questions is a good starting point for discussions, but I found it lacking and ended up writing more questions into the margins - things that I thought should be obvious, but were not mentioned. It is an easy read, and has good talking points for relationships, but reader beware."
5,Lies at the Alter,"Practical yet enlightening. I would recommend this book to anyone that is in a relationship, considering a relationship or just got out of a relationship."
5,"Excellent Advice for A Successful, Long-Lasting Marriage","Lies at the Altar is an excellent book. I learned a lot about what makes a relationship work. The book discusses common pitfalls in marriages, as well as what to look for prior to getting married. It looks at the common myths of what a marriage is compared to the reality and struggles of marriage. I would recommend this book to anyone who is married or in a committed marriage."
4,Read this before you get married.,"The author brought out some thought patterns people have that I have never thought about - subconscious beliefs that we have but don't realize it. The problem is that these beliefs mess up our relationships. An excellent book for those serious about making a lasting marriage.Edited 1-24-2011 to add: It is vitally important for both partners to read this book and to be honest when answering questions. The book is loaded with questions to answer, questions that should be answered in a different space from the person you intend to marry (preferably not even in the same room). I made the mistake of not doing this with some of the questions (we verbally answered them together). It turned out that he answered the questions in ways he thought would please me - and I glossed over some of his answers that were warning signs. So, this book is a useful tool as long as you use it correctly."
1,disappointing,Wasn't very helpful. Gives lots of examples of others problems but not the knowledge of Dr. Robin that I had hoped. Disappointing.....
2,Men are the ones who need to change,"OK, if you want to grovel in front of your wife or wife to be, if you want to admit that you are wrong in everything and she is right, if anything you say is wrong, and everything she says is right, this is the book for you. It is written by a woman with a failed marriage who tells us how to have a successful one. Let me summarize this book in one sentence. ""You're right honey, I am wrong."""
1,Oprah is too influential for our own good,"Dr Smith has been incapable to save her own marriage(s). I wonder what makes her an expert about creating ""great marriages"". I also wonder how this got to be number one. But wait a minute! She was on Oprah the other day!, Ok, I get it now.I just wonder if after all the people that still are going to get divorced after reading this one Oprah will call Dr Smith back to her show and rip her to pieces like she did to poor James Frey"
5,Perfect Pre-Marital Guidelines!,"This is the one book I recommend to every friend I have who is preparing for a serious relationship/marriage. It covers all aspects of what types of things can and will occur in a relationship. My favorite part of the book was the section that talked about the ""Marriage Table"" and what people will end up at your Imaginary Marriage Table, i.e. children, grandparents, ex-spouses, dogs, etc (it will all make sense when you read it.)"
1,too complicated,"I WAS REALLY FIRED UP ABOUT THIS REMOTE CONTROL WATCH, BUT I CAN'T PROGRAM IT! I'VE PROGRAMMED MANY A UNIVERSAL REMOTE IN MY DAY, SOME EASY SOME DANG NEAR IMPOSSIBLE, BUT THIS IS TRUELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME!"
4,they work great,"they were shipped on time and were exactly as they were expected to be,a fair quality item at a fair price"
4,excellent Instructional material,"Very useful practicing, reviewing material for Bharatanatyam adavus. Shows the adavus in slow motion and with the hand movements, eye movements, etc. Easy to follow."
1,Learn Bharatanatyam DVD,"DVD is of poor quality. DVD player is not able to play it but I can play it on my desktop, probably format issue.Video is good for kids who wants to learn BharataNatyam."
1,Half and half,"With all due respects to the teacher, I was excited to buy this item but was disappointed when I got to review this. Everything is so I complete in the video, it's good to watch but will not advise anyone to buy this, it definitely does not help anyone at all, but will only give you an introduction to the dance style, no continuity!"
4,Great bargain,Try to find this product at a health food store or coop for less that twice the price. Can't do it. Vitamin Shoppe brand seems to be the real deal.
3,"Good, but should provide better quality screws","The organizer is very nice. It's just the screws that it came with are not very strong. One broke as I was trying to screw it in. And I did pre-drill before using it. The lower rack cant be used because it will hit the cabinet door and scratch it up. If you notice on the picture, the bottom part of the rack is not fastened so they can show that it will hold a large lid. Pictures can be deceiving.Other than that, it organizes everything very nicely."
4,Great book without the hype,"I love this book because it is very clear. I like how it tackles each component of the pizza: The dough, the Sauce, the cheese.... All done in very simple terms that I can easily duplicate at home. Then you get a little history and some awesome recipes from the classics to creative fare. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I would love to see a second edition with color photos. I have several pizza cookbooks and this is the one that has become my go-to. Greta you will love it."
4,Good guide for snorkeling in Kauai,Good guide for snorkeling in KauaiHelped us find places to go snorkeling. We visited several of the beaches. This book helped us make the best of our time in Kauai.
2,Should be called Beach Guide Instead,"I wanted a book on the best places to Snorkel in Kauai. What I got was a bloated book that includes large color photo's and descriptions of beaches NOT recommended for snorkeling!! (There is even one that lists no way to access it only wishes that they could). Not only am stuck hauling this big book in my luggage, but having to wade through tons of pages of useless information.Final Recommendation: Buy it, rip out all the page for the recommended snorkel spots, staple, and voila -you are left with a precise and now wonderful guide to the snorkeling beaches."
4,Excellent reference for international relocations!,"Book is reference to units of measure. Most conversion rates (i. e. metric to imperial) cover only 2-4,000 terms. This book has 15,000! If you engage in international business this is VERY handy. When you rent an apartment in Japan, they measure in the number of tatami mats for each room, not square meters! When you buy gold in Asia they measure in Teals (slightly over an ounce). The next edition hopefully will include an index by country . . . what specific measures should you expect?"
4,Pop music James Joyce might have loved,"I first owned ""Rock Bottom"" as an LP, a cut-out if I recall correctly, purchased in the late '70's. I especially loved what was side two on the lp, tracks 4-6, which combine unusual drone-style music with lyrics sung in what is either an invented version of English or partial nonsense [tracks four and five] or, in track six, a recitation/chant in the voice of what seems to be another order of intelligent being than human-- perhaps a pixie or a self-conscious badger-- or a lunatic. Surely one of the oddest ""pop"" records ever released, ""Rock Bottom"" must be powerful indeed for me to want to buy the CD reissue 20 years later. Even those familiar with Wyatt's later work will likely be surprised by the evocative textures of this minor classic."
3,Off the wall,"I saw Robert Wyatt play coronet on a David Gilmor DVD so I thought I'd check out some of his earlier work. Very strange, like an old group called Hawkwind his music on this cd seems drug induced. Because I like to keep an open mind I have to give it 3 stars but warn you if your a mainsteam kind of music listener this is not for you. Record quality does not seem to clear unless it is intentional."
3,Not one of my favorites....,"Book is shy 200 pages and large print which if in a standard size print like most books would have been shy 100 pages, thus its a book that is over priced and short on wisdom for someone who has gotten beyond the idea of decluttering and wants valuable information on a total lifestyle change.Also didnt like that most of the book is feedback from some people who have taken a class etc. Overall its a very cheap and sophomoric book on the subject. I returned the book for my money back.Better books that I recommend are Organizing for the Spirit : Making the Details of Your Life Meaningful and Manageable by Sunny Schlenger, and Unclutter Your Life: Transforming Your Physical, Mental and Emotional Space by Katherine Gibson simply because both books besides being less expensive, get to the root of the problem that has begotten you clutter and disorganization in the first place. And their books also help unclutter more than where you live or your work space."
3,The reviewer below noted that open theology isn't the main feature of this book...,"...and I think that's both a fair analysis and a key point to appreciating what it offers. I'm not an open theist, although I enjoy reading some of it (it's thought-provoking), but I don't believe one must be to embrace Boyd's model of warfare theology (outlined both here and in his 'God At War', another compelling book). This is worth reading for those of us who are secure enough in our own theology to be able to hear out other ideas without feeling the need to strike them down, point-for-point. Let the man speak and don't be so quick to judge! If your theology's right, there's no risk. If it isn't, you NEED to be challenged."
4,A great explanation of evil,"This book is the best Theodicy I have read. He has many critics that have mischaracterized his views. This is fresh new and exciting. Most of all it describes how necessary and urgent prayer is for the Christian. This book is worth the read. Be warned you will need your Bible to read along with this, and be prepared to reread text several times. The philosophical argument section (Chapter two) is very difficult if you have not taken a basic Philosophy course or read basic philosophy books. Thankfully the author puts extensive appendixes that give definitions and explain difficult concepts."
1,CHAFF OUTWEIGHS WHEAT,this book is a serious departure from the Bible understanding of God's workings with people on earth.it seems to me to be highly speculative and philosophic than drawn from a plain reading of scripture's clear texts.no possible benefit can be derived from pursuing its train of thought.best to read John Wesley's writings on the subject for a much more accurate view of the Problem of Evil in The Good Lord's world.CHAFF OUTWEIGHS THE WHEATMORE STEAK SAUCE THAN MEAT
3,"Adequate, but disappointing.","Given the subject matter, Boyd does an adequate job of writing... but the entire book reads more like a paper to be presented to a professional community, rather than something that a layman could get anything useful from. As a senior who's taken multiple Bible courses, I was able to make sense of it... but only barely. Also, it was mostly a rehash of points made in prior books, with little new material. Overall, I was disappointed. Had this come from an author I had never read before, I would be satisfied, but this does not hold up to what I have come to expect from Boyd's writing."
2,poorly constructed,"all zippers on back pack have broken - not impressed. should be made with better, heavy duty zippers that will not break. have repaired it ..... Great back pack otherwise."
2,flimsy and bulky,"This tubing was too bulky and cheaply made to hold up and use comfortably. Would return, but not worth the trouble."
1,Bad Purchase,"(3) pieces, each (3) ft. long were rolled up in a box. When opened all were distorted and crushed because of the packaging. In tim the product will regain about 90% of it's memory and will return to it's original shape, but it's a very slow process. What's worse product falls off my toe. I use these to relieve the pressure while running against one of my small toes. The foam tube falls off and ends up under my other toes in the sock, making my outdoor run very uncomfortable. I use to buy a similar product through my foot doctor's office, and paid a higher price. I went back to my doctor's office...this is an example of ""you get what you pay for""."
4,It is a good product.,"Bought this for my husband after he noticed a friend had one, he told me it was what he wanted. My husband works in a shop and figure 8 races so he has used many porta powers and has informed me that this is as good as any porta power. There are pieces that will start to break like the pad will crack on the edges, the rubber ball will get all chewed up from framework, the jaws will work for awhile but will slowly just stop working. The guys at the shop told me ""this is the way all porta powers are"". If you are looking to use the push rods and extended rods they are great, really all around it will still do what it is intended to do. I paid $158.00 which my husband said was a little steep but ""free shipping"" I figured they just added it into the price and living in a small town I can not go to the home improvement store for any cheaper."
2,Dont waste your money,"Even though this doesn't get the stink and burn you get from Ben-gay, I rarely find any relief from this product. I have been through two bottles of the stuff just to be fair and think it is basically a waste of money. I do like tiger balm but it is quite expensive for a small amount."
1,A 200 page paperback should not be $31,"I recently purchased this book, a requirment for one of my classes, at a cost of $32. It is absolutely criminal to charge such an exhorbinant amount of money for 50 cents worth of material. It makes me wonder if college profs, along with the authors of these textbooks are staying within the bounds of America's anti-trust laws. It would seem to me that the price of the book has been inflated beyond what any rational person without a class would pay for it. Here's a theory for you. The college profs and authors of the textbooks have a pact. You require the book that I write and I'll require yours. Then we both charge triple what it's worth and run with the money. Next year we print a twenty-fifth edition simply by changing the chapter order and make out with a steal again. This is rediculous. If it can be prooved a lawsuit is pending."
4,A great book for girls who love Nancy Drew and Horses!,"Bottom line is this is a terrific book to read. It's a great book about horses and of course Nancy Drew!Anybody who loves mysteries will love this book. It's basically about Nancy Drew going to her two best friends'Uncles'house/ranch to have a great time riding horses and solve a mystery. When her friends tell her about all the vandalism that has been going on Nancy knew she had to figure it out. Plus she her friends,and some other people on the ranch have been seeing this so called ""Phantom Horse"" who everybody thinks is a ghost. Nancy doesn't know if it's really a ""ghost horse"" or if somebody on the ranch or anywhere else is just doing this as a prank. That's all I'm going to tell you for now, anyway buy this book you will loooove it!"
4,A thrilling western tale,Nancy drew makes everything interesting when she is caught in another mystery. She meets new friends out in the west and will never forget about them
4,Great mystery,"Great mystery book, have read these books since I was a kid. Haven't read any in years! Great to renew my thirst for a good mystery!"
5,One of the best in the series!,"For all the teenage girls out there who are looking for a good read, but think Nancy Drew is just a little too old, you are TOTALLY wrong.I started reading Nancy Drew when I was seven, and I still love them (I'm 13 now.)This book, especially is really exciting, it takes place on a ranch and the adventure is continuos.You will find yourself on the edge of your seat whispering, ""Hurry, Nancy, he'll find you!""the overall plot of the story if fantastic, and, like all of Keene's books, it's really worth reading! I would suggest this book to everyone, no matter theyre age or sex."
5,Nancy Drew and the Secret of Shadow Ranch,"Nancy Drew is the main character and she is a young sleuth who has solved four mysteries. There is a mystery out at Shadow Ranch. Shadow Ranch is a dangerous place and can lead to a lot of harm because of rock slides. A 12 year old's father was missing for three months before they found him. He was held prisoner by the people who were causing trouble on the ranch. The best part of the story is when they find out the mystery. If you like mysteries, I recommend this book."
2,"Kind of boring, but not completely bad...","I read the 1931 version. This book is signifigant because it introduces Bess and George, but otherwise it's sort of boring. It was written more like the western adventure books that were being written at the time rather than Nancy Drew mystery story for the most part, but it was still okay, and well written, at least."
2,I Was Let Down,I have been really pleased with the Nancy Drew series up until this book.It started out slow and just become even more boring.This book is no diffrent than any other western books that were released during this time.Bess and George are the only thing keeping this book from getting one star.
5,great,I bought these for a friend. I like the light blue tint lenses. I like that they are not mirrored. They have great UV protection. Seems to be good quality for the price. Ordering more.
2,no one answer for everyone,"I tried to read this book, but had to stop after 4-5 chapters because I felt that Ms. Holcomb was too biased for working mothers and against the ""traditional"" SAHM. I work full-time outside the home in sales & marketing and hate it. But at the same time I don't want to be a full-time SAHM mom. Certainly I need more time with my daughter, but I also need the intellectual stimulation, adult contact & social stimlation that work provides. I would like to be able to work part-time or do a job share, but this society just doesn't go for that. I also feel that my daughter needs the stimulation and contact that daycare provides her. She would tire of being with me constantly; she does when we have long holiday weekends. When we are home for 3 or more days together, I find it hard to entertain her and do housework, cooking, etc. Thank goodness that I have a supportive husband who devotes as much time to our daughter as I do."
4,"Want to learn the basics and then some, this is the book","Very detailed information on about everything needed to install and modify a turbocharged motor. The formulas are great and well explained, don't let all the numbers, ('s, +'s, and -'s confuse you, the information makes sense when you read the page. The tips, advice, and knowledge in this book carry over to a bunch of things i've been involved in. Get this if you want to know something."
5,This book ROCKS! I give it a BOOST 10+,"The best Jerry... THE BEST!Does not treat you like an idiot. This is the real deal... If you can't understand this book you shouldn't be working on your own car! It's not a ""This is the distributor, it goes round and round"" - Kll me now book! It's got the techno babble you've been waiting for. They talk the talk yet don't murder you with over the top math problems. If you want to be a TurBoWizKid this is a MUST HAVE. Also, you won't be lending this to your friends because you'll worry about not getting it back :) And yes, you can't please all the people ALL the time but this book comes as close as you can get when having to sell to a mass market. And no... I'm not the author :)RandyLong Beach, Ca."
4,I liked it.,The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because It was very light on the carb modifications and cam selection. I really liked the project vehicle section. Everything is layed out nicely and for a newcoming would be great.
1,A nice cover but...,I was expecting a lot of specific tuning tips as was promised in the descriptionIt didn't tell me what I needed to know. Too much basic information.It's a perfect book for a beginner or a tuner wannabe.
3,modern chinese poetry:theory and practice since 1917,a good book to know new tendencies in Chinese poetry in last century
3,Mixed Emotions,"Well...I really like the set with only one problem. The set looks great, and is really nice for both boys and girls. The only fault is the fact that the bumper attachment strings came off with very little tugging and needed to be sewn on again. Other wise it is great."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY....FALLS APPART,"Even though this bedding is adorable for a nursery it falls apart when washed. I used manufactures directions and it shredded and came apart at the seams. Baby bedding, while being soft and comfortable, should also be durable enough to wash on a regular basis."
1,Falls apart when washed,"This was the only set at Babies R Us that I remotely liked. I read all of the wonderful reviews about the set on this website, and I'm sorry to say that the other parents must have written their reviews before attempting to wash the set. I washed the bumper as instructed - cold water, delicate cycle and it fell apart. For the amount of money that this set costs, I couldn't believe that it fell apart when washed once. I don't think it will be very practical to have something in the crib that can't be washed without ripping apart. Very disappointing."
2,Don't Get A Crib Set,"I would not recommend buying a crib set. We have this one and it is cute, but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS. The valences hang down really low, so we were unable to use them with our blinds. Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them, so we have yet to use the comforter. We did get the rug, found the set of pictures that match, and use the crib skirt. They are cute in his room. We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too."
5,ADORABLE FOR A BOY OR A GIRL!!,"i fell in love with this theme and soon as i seen it, with my first son i had gotten winnie the pooh i didnt want to the same with my new son. i shopped around for almost 4mths trying to figure out what i wanted, which of course was neutral i didnt know what i was having yet. I had seen the bedding set @ babies r us first, thought it was kind of high but i loved it, i ended up going to baby depot i bought it there for 129.99 it was on sale. I love the colors on it very neutral and all the extras that you can get for it, i plan to have 1 more child so i believe if i have a girl it will go perfect as well."
4,Adorable - But Be Realistic About What You'll Use!,"We love love love this pattern! My only regret is that we didn't measure the nursery window first. The valance is fairly short, so it won't reach across our wide window. I plan to hang it above the closet door, instead. Also, does anybody even USE a diaper stacker anymore? I think they should have included another sheet, decorative pillow, or nightlight instead of the diaper stacker. Other than these two issues, it has been great.I highly recommend getting some solid jersey knit or flannel sheets (sage green and baby blue) to match. The fabrics aren't as startling as cold cotton when you lay a sleepy baby down on them."
4,Not bad but don't wash it too much,I really like this bedding. The theme is quite perfect since my husband and I both like animals. Our main reason for purchasing this set was the animals. We immediately washed the set and we were surprised that it didn't hold up well. Do not wash this set too much. We purchased additional crib sheets and these we change often but don't wash this set if you don't have to. Otherwise this is one of the best sets out there.
3,mom of 2 boys,"It seems like the only people who are writing these reviews are working for Kidsline Co. Why haven't anyone noticed that As soon as you wash this set for the first time, it looks worn out. After the first washing the dust ruffle was torn, And the wall border has such a horrible toxic odor even while dry and even worse when wet. I had a headache the entire day afterwards."
4,The Cutest Nursery Theme!,"I like this bedding set. Our baby loves the animals. We also got the mobile, the lamp, and the wall hangings. It's great for a boy or a girl, so you will get lots of use out of it. The colors are nice and neutral, but cheerful enough for a baby's room! A great bedding set all around. The comforter part is kind of impractical, but great as a decoration."
4,Answer to Aug. 8th paint color question,"I love this bedding, too! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it could have a higher thread count, but it's really cute and works for a little boy (we're having a boy). I plan to get higher-thread-count crib sheets for the elements that actually touch the baby.Anyway, an earlier reviewer wanted to know what color paint matches the yellow. We got ours at Home Depot--it's by Behr, and the color is ""Moon Dance"", no. 380C-3. Yellows are very hard, because what looks fine on a paint chip can scream luridly from 4 walls. This color is a nice, clean, pale-lemon color that offsets the sage-and-blue tones we're using in the rest of the room. It's warm but not intrusive. Just thought I'd offer that up as a public service. Enjoy!"
5,LOVE THIS SET,"I love this bedding set, we bought this as a neutral set b/c we didn't know what we were having. My firts choice was Noah's Ark, we couldn't find it and this was our next choice, I am glad we chose this one. Now that we have our son we love it and its perfect for him. We are now thinking of getting the whole set of accessories that go along with it. Its great for any parent that loves the neutral look and don't like the whole athletic or barn yard theme for a boy. The colors are great and bright enough for him to love and enjoy w/o blinding him either."
5,PERFECT!,"This is the cutest theme. My 2 month old son loves looking at the animals, he just stares at them. The bedding is good quality and I love everything about the entire set!!"
4,How cute it is,"We are having a boy and wanted something more on sporty looking, but everything we found was to bright and not soothing for a infant. We love this set. We painted the bottom half of the room blue and the top half yellow with the border inbetween. It looks great. The two colors realy bring out all of the plaid patterns. My only problem is the valance, it is too big for a normal size window. It does not need to be as long as it is. And if they are going to put one in the set they might as well put the other in there too. Most rooms have two windows."
3,Cute as can be BUT..............,"We absolutely adored this set! It looks great in our baby room and it could work for a boy or girl! However, when I washed everything for the first time it all came out of the dryer a wrinkled disaster and I spent a lot of time ironing!! Although if you iron everything with a damp towel on top of it it'll look better in the end! Nothing seemed to shrink which was good except for the hamper, which doesn't come with the set....we bought that separately. Otherwise a great buy!"
5,Great colors and design! Highly recommended!,"We bought this set before we found out that we were having a girl, but then we wanted something neutral just in case. We painted the room light green at the bottom and then light yellow on top with the border in the middle. The border is quite pricey and the set only comes with one valance. But everthing blended well. We had no problems with the fabric after washing them. We just love how calming it looks! It is easy to blend almost anything with it because of the different colors that it carries. Definitely would recommend to other parents!"
4,Happy Mom-to-be,"After finding out my pregnancy had a low chance of miscarriage, the bedding set was the most exciting purchase in my mind. I am not thrilled with getting everything that matches exactly with a set. I also plan to avoid the pink or blue standard wall colors. I'd like a more original and versatile nursery. The Malawi set gives me the opportunity to pull out the pretty orange colors for the walls and have a fun and different nursery. The animals are cute and I found a great stuffed giraffe to help bring out the orange. The set is perfect for a boy or girl, and now that I know I am having a girl, I can adjust my nursery to be a little more feminine. The only problem I have is that the vallance is too short. Another reviewer said it was too long. I guess we have a big nursery window. I'll have to add side curtain panels if I want to use it."
5,My favorite!,"This book about Platypus and his collection is priceless! It's a great read-aloud for preschoolers. The illustrations are large and beautiful. It also makes a great snuggle and read together book. While it is wonderful as a stand alone story, it is great as an introduction to marine life (hermit crab), collecting things, or to introduce egg laying mammals. Platypus has a stuffed animal ""echidna."" One of my all time favorite childrens books!"
5,Excellent illustrations and FUN story,"Don't listen to a negative review of this book! My two kids (4 and 2) love the story and get a huge kick out of watching the hermit crab peeking out of the collecting box, and pulling one over on Platypus. We also get lots of giggles when the crab bites Platypus's foot. This is definitely a book I recommend and don't mind reading over and over. Highly recommended."
3,"Not quite what I had expected, but...","This plush toy wasn't quite as firmly stuffed as the other Pooh characters we were trying to match it with, but it does look like the picture."
5,"Good quality, good looking, fits in well.","This Powell Mission Oak Bed Bench is as good as it looks in the picture. It is quite sturdy, when all the joints are tightened up.A tip on assembly. The hangar bolt has two parts. One is a threaded cylindrical nut. When that is put in the hole, push it as deeply as possible so that the bolt will fit into it. By turning the nut slowly with one screwdriver and turning the bolt with another screwdriver, it is possible to ""feel"" the bolt go into the beveled hole on the nut. Then turn the bolt into the nut.Also, it may be easier to put the bolts into the top of the bench first, then turn the bench on its side to thread in the lower bolts.The seat cushion fastens with some wood screws and there are no pre-drilled holes. Make sure the cushion is aligned before turning in the screws."
5,So much more than a mere adventure.,"Granted the film adaptation by Irwin Allen is a classic of its kind, but Paul Gallico's source novel is so, so much more than a mere adventure novel. The Poseidon Adventure is also a dark psychological novel about the human will and the human character, how it constantly shifts and changes, yet remains the same at its very core. Don't be fooled by the swift pace and high adventure, careful reading of this excellent piece of entertainment will be a richly rewarding experience for you. Highly recommended."
3,"Overcooked, but good for fans of John Sykes","The second Blue Murder album is a bit of a catch-all in that it features tracks with the original trio, with the Marco Mendoza version of the group, and even one with (temporary) lead singer Kelly Keeling. For metal fans, there's a bunch of excellent material here, but I can't help but feel that it all suffers in comparison to the fantastic first album. The album is 1-2 songs too long, and it was released too late to catch any of the heat from the semi-success of the first CD. Nonetheless, the playing is great, and the 2nd version of the group is at least a good stand-in for the first, with Mendoza proving himself especially able. Sykes has some better lyrics on this album and shows himself maturing as a songwriter."
4,Great Game for Boys,My seven year old son has really enjoyed playing this game. I would reccommend it for any football fans. The stats and play options keep him busy for hours.
4,A fun GBA football game but lacks one thing.,"Madden 07 is a very fun video game for the GBA. It's very easy to play and fun. But the only thing I wished it had was a career option, I know the memory size of the cartridge makes that unlikely, but it would have made this game perfect. That's my only complaint. I highly recommend this game for it's sheer fun."
2,It's a bit slight...,"After ""Paradis"", ""Destiny"" and now ""Redemption"" read like combined and inflated scripts for Richard Hatch's proposed season for a new ""Battlestar Galactica"" sequel TV series. The problem is that they're too episodic, with too little resolution. They don't stand well as novels on their own. There's been little real plot advancement, just incidents, stuff happening, and all shortly after the post ""Paradis"" split of the fleet (it's telling that half the fleet doesn't actually get to its destination, while the other half stays where they were at the start of the book). With the demise of ibooks, I have to wonder if Richard Hatch will get to finish telling the meta story. It still feels undone."
1,"I'm a big fan of Battlestar Galactica, but...","this book is pretty useful as a paperweight. With all due respect to Richard Hatch, the book doesn't flow well. It seems choppy. There are places throughout the book where the story moves from one character to the next without any break in the text to notify the reader. I found myself reading sections several times trying to figure out what was going on. Maybe this is the fault of the publisher, or formatting the print, and not the author.I leapt at the chance to own one of Hatch's novels. Prior to reading this book, I was looking for copies of his previous Battlestar Galactica books to add to my collection. Now I'm not so sure.The ending of this novel leaves the impression there will be more to come. Check your local library for future books, but leave your money in your wallet. (Unless you need a good paperweight...)"
5,"Good Instructor, Good Lesson","If ur looking to pick up a couple of ZW tricks this is a very good dvd.. first of all the instructor is very coherent and makes it easy to pick up.. Also a part for beginners w intro to minor pentatonic and blues scales.. Parts on country and southern rock approach and licks also very nice, gives u a raw foundation for further approach.."
3,Very Basic lead playing of Zakk,"This essentially is a basic representation of Zakk's style. For the most part it is generalized lead playing and a few rhythm chops. This is good for the player who wants to graze some metal style and learn a few chops when Zakk played with Ozzy. However, if you are heavily into Zakk and have a gist of metal playing, then I would get something a bit more defined and somewhat more complex."
1,"Great, I'm sure but...","I've waited for this and the solo's version for ever, unfortunately, they are only available in PAL format. It does not list the format in the DVD info. So disappointing. Have to send mine back."
2,"Saga of Mennonite history, flawed by anti-semitic bias.","Rimland's saga sweeps across five centuries of Mennonite history from Menno Simons to the present. The focus is upon two Mennonite villages: ""Apanlee"" in the Molotschna settlement of the Ukraine, and ""Mennotown,"" near Hillsboro in south-central Kansas. The main characters belong to two interrelated families in these villages. The story moves from a golden age built on Mennonite virtue to a disaster imposed by evil outside forces. Volume one is filled with stories of romance, love and community creation in Kansas and the Ukraine. Rimland is a vigorous storyteller, especially alert to the experiences and feelings of women. But her writing is repetitive and few of the characters rise above the level of carricature. The novel is flawed by an antisemitic bias. Rimland links Mennonite virtues to the Nazi ideology of a super race. Her ideological agenda gets in the way of her literary ambition."
2,The title certainly speaks for itself ..,"I am a fan of the author but ....OK in this book we have a young girl, Robin, recounting her life story, first with the vicar of the small town, and then with practically all the young boys and men of the village as well. As her skills become well know she starts to worry that maybe she's building a reputation as the village 'bycicle' ... course that sure doesn't stop her from enjoying the fruits of nature ....To make matters worse she then moves in with a nutbag of a psychlogist as his housekeeper .. and then the rest of the village prctically moves in with her as well .... I did not like this book because the nutbag doctor is such a crazy that there is no way I as the reader can hope to even closely identify with the character or get into the story ....I didn't even like Robin because this is one girl that just can't keep her mouth shut .... at least not for more than one or two pages ......"
2,Good content but I didn't know it was homemade,"I agree this had useful content - especially the day planning section. However it is - how do I put this - cheesy looking. It looks totally homemade. Different fonts on different pages give it a very amateur appearance. It's just a book anyone with a binding machine and Microsoft Word could make. The cover is hideous - I promptly ripped it off, as well as the back. I'll use it because I already bought it, but it's just not attractive at all."
4,BRAVO,"Not all books are a good match but this one fit me to a ""T"". I say bravo to the author for creating a main female character Mirabella that has strength, isn't afraid to tell it like it is and doesn't take anyones crap yet is a sweet, giving individual. On top of that the other characters were not pushy, mean, controling but loving and kind.Not everyone will like this book but I sure did especially since I found it for free. Enjoy.P.S. I only give 5 stars to books I would keep in my collection and this was one of those borderline ones."
2,didn't do it for me,"I wanted to like it, but I got bored, and made myself finish. I just never connected to the story or characters."
5,Success Unlimited,"I use this book with students. They love it! It provides helpful strategies to enhance listening skills, note taking skills, comprehension, test taking preparation and time management. Students keep this book and refer to it often."
4,Elementary...,"This book is basically designed for an elementary, maybe middle school aged child. THe focus is on critical thinking, and everyday life skills such as balancing your checkbook, and managing your time wisely."
1,The teacher is always right! The student is always wrong!,"That's the main message of this textbook. According to this worthless piece of junk, if you fail in a class, it's totally your fault. There are no such things as bad professors, just bad students. No matter how well you think you tried to take notes and be an ""active listener,"" you apparently just weren't trying hard enough! If you get a bad grade on a test, why, the professor NEVER could have supplied you with unclear, badly written questions, or even quizzed you on material you didn't cover! It's all YOUR fault! And don't you ever dare disagree with the teacher, even if they're stating something factually wrong! You're mistaken!"
5,Ustedes los Ricos,A masterpiece! Superb acting by Pedro Infante...a must have collection along with Pepe el Toro & Nosotros los Pobres!
4,Mexican Golden Era classic,Pedro Infante was like Elvis and John Wayne put together so no greater actor.Also these movies are very dramatically and passionately made .Additionally I think these movies still influence heavily the film and soap opera industry today.
5,Ustedes los ricos,"When I going to purchase an item I like to view a good description of the product, for example a movie, I like to know the artist of the movie, etc. and other thing that make me want to purchased it."
2,For this she won a pulitzer?,"One of Ours begins as vintage Cather, you can feel the sun on your face and the soil under your feet. The characters are real and people you know. The troubled protagonist, Claude, is sympathetic. Why not? There's something of him in all of us. Unfortunately, the book falls apart when he enlists as a doughboy and ships to France.Cather once stated that she experienced everything that ever went into her writing by the time she was 15. Clearly that didn't include the Western Front. The second half of the book, based on her research and interviews with WWI vets, is not her experience and it shows. The events and descriptions are shallow and superficial, and felt more like an outline, without flesh and blood. The book was a disappointment."
3,"Worth reading, but not Cather at her best","I am not certain that Willa Cather wrote anything that was not worth reading, but I do think this is the weakest of the ten or so of her works that I have read. If you have read and enjoyed her other books, by all means read it. If you haven't read her at all, I would recommend instead DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, THE PROFESSOR'S HOUSE, or SHADOWS ON THE ROCK, or her prairie books MY ANTONIA or O PIONEERS. This book is a decent book by a great writer."
4,Moving;Kept coming back to it.,"This is my first Willa Cather book and I was very impressed with her descriptions of the Nebraska lifestyle. Claude was a cornered and ho-hum young man forever destined to live the life others expected of him. Then the war gave new meaning to his life and seemingly a direction. His wife reminded me of Scarlett O'Hara in many ways--her selfishness and use of other people. I was glad to see her go to China so Claude could breathe. The depiction of the trench war was so vivid and was the most exciting part of the book for me. The relationships formed among the soldiers was what life really is about, and Claude finally found significance in his. A purpose! I intend to read more Cather."
1,One of Ours,Numerous typo errors. Don't think anyone proof read the text. This is definitely not the copy one should buy. No introductory essay or comments.
4,"Good, but Uneven","""One Of Ours"" starts out so strong, but ends flat. It drags out too long. Her story of farm and small town life are great, but her descriptions of war and Europe at the end seem almost like a separate story. Start Willa Cather by reading ""My Antonia"" and some of her short stories and then get to ""One of Ours"". Cather is great, but this is not the place to start."
4,"Not her best, but still very good","Nothing can compare with Cather's O, PIONEERS, or even her SONG OF THE LARK, but this book is pretty darn close. The writing is the same--good--as in her other books, but the one thing I DID like better about ONE OF OURS is the fact that it explores a more psychological aspect of the main character---especially that of someone during the WWI period. As with all Cather's books, they are crafted well. A few may find her a little too wordy, but consider that these were written in a time when there was no TV, few movies, and barely any radio. It's what people wanted back then."
3,A good work by a superior writer,"Very engaging book dealing with a young man growing up in Nebraska and how he struggles to find happiness. Cather's books are always rich in character development, and this is no exception. The pacing is slow yet beguiling, and I found myself transported by her careful use of language and description.Well worth checking into. While it isn't on the same level as 'My Antonia', I found it better than some of her other books such as 'Death Comes for the Archbishop'"
2,Great story/Terrible edition,"I was shocked by the shoddy formatting of this book. Text begins and ends with little logic. It looked like a problem between two computer programs, and was extremely distracting. The large format of the book was also very clumsy. Buy a different edition of this moving Cather work."
4,war novel but more than that,One of Ours is Cathers novel about WWI but it is more than that which is good since the army and battle sequences are the weakest in the book. It is actually about Claude Wheeler a small town Nebraska farm boy who finds his town and the entire state to be stultifying. H is life is dull and purposeless and his romantic temperament leads him to do one great thing.That ends up being an american soldier in WWI. Claude is a vivid character and he ends up loving France more than America. It is for her and not the US that he ends up fighting for because France has a history and a culture that prizes beauty and tradition and not the materialism that Claude despises. The book would be 5 stars but Cathers war sequences are unimpressive so I give it 4
3,One of Ours,"Did not think I as going to enjoy this book, it is very different to her other novels. However, I kept with it was not disappointed. I would recommend this book if you were already familiar with Willa Cather's work as it is strickingly different to My Antionia and Oh Pioneers! yet continues the underlying themes of both books."
2,DID ANYONE PROOF READ??,"THIS STORY LINE AND WRITING ARE GREAT, BUT THE BOOK IS A TOTAL MESS. EVERY PAGE HAS AT LEAST TWENTY WORDS THAT ARE JOINED TOGETHER. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS HER WRITING STYLE, BUT ABSOLUTELY NO EXPLANATION. I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THEIR BOOK? I WAS IN A HURRY AND ORDERED IT FOR MY BOOK CLUB, ACTUALLY TWO COPIES. IT IS ALMOST UNBELIEVABLE UNLESS IT IS INTENTIONAL AND THEN, PLEASE TELL ME WHY IT IS THIS WAY."
4,A compelling work,"Willa Cather's One of Ours follows the life of Claude Wheeler, a Nebraska farm boy who is searching for some meaning to his existence. With his study at the university stripped away because of his father's farm, he bitterly drives himself into the monotony of farm life, establishes himself, and weds a woman who has little affection for him. Claude is searching for some kind of sustenance to create a life that has more meaning than chopping wood and mending fence. WWI comes along and Claude enthusiastically enlists in a cause he can be proud of, and finds a sense of purpose in the trench warfare, feeling a brotherhood among his fellow soldiers. One of Ours is a bildungsroman of a disillustioned and bitter man. To any reader interested in the Modern Period of American Literature, this novel pounds home the common themes of that period. Cather's description is adept as usual, while her plot is somewhat predictable. Nonetheless, it's a solid novel for readers to sink their teeth into."
1,Horrible typography in this edition,"This review is about this specific edition. The typography is atrocious. Numerous, pervasive errors are found throughout the text, usually 10-20 per page. Almost always it is two words pushed together: ""butit""; ""moneywas""; ""toYucca""; etc. This is not the edition to get. Unfortunately I had already written in this book or I would have returned it. I do not understand how Amazon sells something like this. Again: DO NOT GET THIS EDITION! It is awful."
5,Marriage woes,"Man oh man...the description of Claude and Enid's wedding night and ""marriage"" is timeless!"
3,The book slowly ran out of steam,"As this was the first work from Willa Cather that I had ever read, I wasn't sure what to expect. Her description of Nebraska farm life was quite vivid and interesting. I really felt like I could understand the feelings and thoughts of Claude Wheeler. I empathized with his feeling that his life was going nowhere. However, when the book shifted from Nebraska to France during WWI, it lost some of its appeal. There was seemingly no connection between ""the two Claudes."" I enjoy reading works in which the characters ""grow"", but the WWI Claude seemed like a totally different, and not as interesting, character. The story and character development that was so engaging in the first part of the book, was no longer there. Overall I think it was a fair work. I would probably like to read some of her works that focus on prairie and farm life."
3,One of Ours,"Way too slow for me. It is probably a good read. I just could not get into it, good story."
4,hot pants,"I actually havn't worn the pants yet.....We had a cold front a couple weeks back and I thought to order these "" warm"" pants. When they arrived I tried them on, and almost immediatly started to get hot, to the point where shortly after, beads of sweat started to run down my leg.It hasn't been cold enough to wear them outside yet. They seem comfortable and a good buy for the price....Happy purchace"
2,Not the right size,when clicking on link it did not say they did not have them it sent what it did have
4,great pair of work pants,"pants are a great fit, maybe want to order an inch or two shorter, so the cuff is the correct size when folded back."
5,thermal linning excellent,on the north east coast u.k these are terrific in these cold frosty mornings and fit is excellent not found in a lot of jeans these days

4,comments,this book presents a theory of control systems clearly and lucidly and presents the matlab simulation of control systems in a way which is most needed for brush-up in the eleventh hour. the author has taken keen interest in presenting the subject right from the grassroot level and a gradual development of the concepts is presented in the easy-to-use tool like way. i firmly believe that this should be in the bag of all engineers working on simulation of control systems.
1,Only Good as a Reference,"This book was very haphazard to use. It is not very clear on many subjects, and does not explain its topics well. Too much focus in on MATLab and not enough on the concepts or the procedures needed for design of a good control system. Way too much emphasis on the Bode optimal cutoff. Little else besides Bode is even mentioned. The examples are not very helpful and some only add confusion. Material not explained well. This may be a great book for reference but it is an awful choice for an introductory course."
1,ouch!,"I had the same experience that others have described--burning, stinging on my skin, even when I gave it plenty of time to dissolve in hot water. I felt like I was bathing in shards of glass. Afterward, I had to clean the tub out with a damp paper towel as those ""shards"" wouldn't wash down the drain. I have liked other Burt's products, but this one is a bust."
5,"Love, love love","I love these bath crystals, tired/sore muscles.. these work great to relax them... Strong Eucalyptus smell clears nasal passages tooo!!"
1,Awful!,"I generally like Burt's Bees products as well, however, this product is awful. I let it dissolve in the bath per the instructions...after five minutes my skin started to itch and burn all over! I tried adding more water to dilute it a little, but it didn't help. My skin was bright red when I got out of the bath and the itching/burning lasted for another 15-20 minutes. I will NOT buys this again! If your skin is at all sensitive, steer clear!"
1,Smells terrible!!!,"I wish I had been able to try this out or at least smell it before I bought it. I knew it was going to smell herbal based on the ingredients, but I barely got the lid off the container before it brought tears to my eyes. I returned this to the store. Normally I like Burt's Bees but this is just too pungent!"
2,The product is not the one in picture,"The shipment was fast, but when I received it it was not the one in picture. It likes totally different. I am so disappointed."
3,"if you feel under the weather or achy, this is the soak for you","it packs a nose-popping smell that fills the area, and needs a while for the chunky pieces of salt to dissolve. Be careful, as I've run into some batches that do not dissolve all the way, leaving some gray specks in my tub that sort of burn the skin if the flecks land on you. This is one out of 3 cans that I've had of this product. Also, the canister will rust, so don't leave the canister out while bathing, or you'll have a rust-spotted can to hold your salts. I like the can! These are pretty well-priced salts and I always pick up a can if I see one while shopping. I don't think there's enough oil in them to moisturize skin if you soak in the bath for hours at a time."
2,Maybe for a cold? Or the flu?,"The salts smell like a white or yellow cough drop. If you smell them straight out of the tin, it definitely burns your nose. When they say therapeutic, they mean it. Don't buy these if you just want a nice, lemon-scented bath salt. I will be using them on the event that I get sick, but for everyday, they are horrible and the scent stays with you.Also, you will need a can opener (like, the same as you'd use to open paint cans) to get into the package. Then, inside the metal can is a bag of the salts. The can rusts (I had a ring on my tub when I picked it up), so you may want to cover the bottom with tape or nail polish, or permanently keep it in a cupboard away from water."
5,Bath crystals,I've used this product several times already in my bath. It works wonders. I plan on buying more when this jar runs out.
5,Pill smart-Patient saavy,"For the Patient who wants to know about prescription drugs efficacy, side effects and cautions ""The Pill Book"" is a modestly priced and handy reference which puts the Patient on the same level with a Physicians drug reference manual, when it comes to uderstanding the consumption of precribed medications. If we want to know about what food we put into our mouths, why not know what pills we consume ?"
4,Great resource,I bought this product for my mother and she just loved it. She says it is a great resource for her prescriptions.
2,Massive but Limited,"If all you want is the patient information often handed out by drug stores, this is the book for you -- it covers almost all the prescription drugs on the market.If, however, you want the pharmacology, etc., or even the name and address of the drug maker, you need the full PDR."
2,Pocket guide - HA!,"The info is valuable but this is advertized as a ""pocket guide"" - not in my pocket! I'm a CRNA and wanted a small reference convenient to pick up and look up medications while in the hospital. I leave this book home - I use it there."
1,"If you LIKED this film, DON'T buy this video!","I only gave this VIDEO one star, but I'd give the FILM 4 stars. I really like this film, in spite of some of the implausable ideas like a single person being able to arm our nuclear arsenal. However, this particular video being sold (which I bought and have just now viewed) is MASSACRED! It looks & sounds like someone set up a camcorder in their living room & taped the movie off their TV. The sound is TERRIBLE, the framing cuts off any captions & subtitles, and, to add insult to injury, they CUT OUT the last 10 minutes of the film showing the journey back to the survivors in Antartica -- it ends with the world being destroyed by the nuclear explosions! Shame on whoever did this! Now I have to go try to buy a used Beta machine on eBay so I can watch my old Beta tape of this movie!"
4,"Bad video, Great Movie","I watched this as a streaming version, and the video quality is horrendous, it's blurry and dark. The sound is uneven. This film is about a bacteriological weapon that gets loose and destroys most of the world, but no one knows where it actually started and there was no vaccine for it. The only real survivors are in the Antarctic 800 men and 8 women. They discover that there will be an earthquake near Washington DC and that will set off the US's nuclear attack system and if that goes off then the Russian system will go off. The film is a decent study of what might happen if such a thing occurred and probably closer to the truth of what might actually happen than most American made disaster movies. You will have to suspend your disbelief for some of the things that happen in the movie. But still a great movie. I will try to find the longer version as suggested by some of the reviewers here."
5,Hard to find video,"May not be the best quality, but I believe it is typical of the era and not popular enough to be enhanced. I give the five stars to Amazon for carrying it. Thanks!"
4,Great movie. Deserves a better DVD,"I didn't know what to expect from ""Virus"". I was very pleasantly surprised. It grabbed hold of my interest from the start and never let go. The cast is great, with Glenn Ford as the US president, Henry Silva as a general and George Kennedy as the leader of the survivors in Antarctica.A strong four star rating for the movie. My DVD was not good at all, pan-and-scanned and with pretty bad picture quality. So I hope someone will give this movie a decent DVD release. But until then, try to find a cheap copy; don't miss the movie."
2,80's movie,This was a slow movie and very predictable and the acting for popular stars was some what disapointing.
5,Fun to read.,This book was very interesting and just plain fun to read. Would be a good book for an older child to read.
4,Great book,My children and I both loved the characters and the play on words for the names. Great story. Thoroughly pleased.
1,Much less than advertised,Even though it was free it wasn't worth it. Someone has a serious case of nostalgia that's distorting their viewpoint. Unreadable.
4,Granny's wonderful Chair,This was a wonderful old book. A great story for children to read or to be read by a parent to them. I am a grandmother and I loved this book. Very good story line.
1,Lighter than Air,"The lightest ""Teach Yourself ... in 21 Days"" book I've ever seen. You'll find no meat here. The best JBuilder book on the market is still Cary Jensen's ""JBuilder Essential"" (in spite of the fact it is based on JBuilder 1.0). Because there are no meaty JBuilder books on the market, and because there are such excellent (meaty) Java books on the market, spend your money on any or all of these three books (you won't be sorry): (1.)Cay Horstman's ""Core Java 1.1"" (Volume 1); (2.) David Geary's ""Graphic Java 1.1""; (3.)Cay Horstman's ""Core Java 1.1"" (Volume 2); Additionally, David Geary will soon be releasing two more books which are likely to be top notch, given this author's history."
1,Not that great....,"Unless you know absolutely nothing about JBuilder 2.0, don't get this book. It's an OK startup tuturial for someone who just opened the box and installed the software, but if you're any more experienced than that, get a different book. What I found most annoying was the non-existant components guide. We need more than just a page saying ""And here's what the DBSwing component bar looks like...""."
1,Absolute Waste of Money! - 0 star if allowed,"It seems the arthor has just copied the summary from JBuilder2 brochure from Borland. If you want to learn JBuilder, don't waste money on this crab. Read developer's guide from Borland comes with the software."
2,Reading chapter 6 I thought : Disappointing,"I'm a novice in OO/Java programming. At the moment I'm struggling through chapter 6. Chapter 5 and 6 are really disappointing, even for a novice. Can anybody tell me if the rest is usefull, otherwise I'm going to succumb. Alas."
1,"Typical 21 day book - superficial, poor index & ex + no CD","More pratical examples are needed. A CD would be a great asset. I's very hard to lookup keywords via the index (example: Import keyword isn't listed) etc.Sorry, it's just your normal lowquality 21 day book, which means you NEVER will use it again after the 21 days has past."
2,"Good start, but needs better accuracy","While it is good to have books like this, to help educate scientists in non-mainstream Japanese, there are quite a lot of mistakes that I have come across - both in the English and the Japanese. Also, some of the Japanese usage is quite strange, and generally a bit outdated.For me, the greatest use is in the vocabulary, however without an index it is quite difficult to track down the specific words.Could be useful to have around, however will need a bit of work, hopefully with a few Japanese scientists, if there is going to be another edition."
2,BOMB,"Like a lot of movies it has maybe one good scene. Advice on working with actord is basically correct. Advice on how to cut budget is puching it. One thing most people learn is to NOT edit in the camera, but to have a well planned shoot with the option to shoot throw aways. While other authors use award winning, audience pleasing, well-known films, she opted to use less than memorable work."
3,a howling in the night,"Another perfectly good kid ruined...Turned into a Gothic monster who roams the woods at night.Some people are scared of their own shadowsand stories like this get to them.Knowing people,you find that they are monsters enoughwithout any need of imagination.I wasn't trilled by this swamp tale."
5,Goosebumps book,This bool is the one my little girl wanted and she read it read away. She loved it very much.
3,undisclosed damage,"The book, although in otherwise good shape as described, had significantly visible water damage that was brown in color. This was not disclosed in the description."
4,CHRISTMAS WISH CAME,"AS A GRANDMA I WAS GLAD THAT MY GRANDAUGHTERS REQUEST FOR GOOSEBUMPSBOOKS COULD BE MET. I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND THE TITLES SHE REQUESTED AND CHRISTMAS WAS GETTING CLOSER SO I WENT TO BOOKSELLERS ON AMAZON AND WAS VERY HAPPY THAT I RECEIVED THEM IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. THANK YOU! JOAN MAPLEWOOD,MN"
1,Cheap for a Reason,"The Wolfcraft table is one of the cheapest tables you will find and for good reason. The parts are ill fitting and poorly designed. The guides move independently from each other making alignment difficult, and the clear plastic safety cover all but falls off with a little bump. Here are my recommendations, if you want the capabilities of a table at this price, find a high quality edge guide and make a jig or two, and if you really want a table and the convenience it provides, consider looking at the $230 model from Kreg (its well worth the upgrade)."
5,Real Help for Real Parents,"As a parent, I've read lots of parenting books. Most of them seem to tell you what to think and what to do, and often give advice that doesn't really fit for me or my children. But this one encourages you to think for yourself, and to really observe and understand your child, to figure out what works with him or her. I love it. Reading it is like having a chance to talk things over with someone who really knows what being a parent is like. I felt very helped by it, and very much liked the authors respectful tone.All this, and it's short, and easily readible - very important for tired, busy parents!I think this is a wonderful book is perfect for mothers and fathers who have a child up to three years old."
5,Must have,"We found this book in Florida by accident and picked up a copy. Upon returning, we shared it with our Rabbi and Cantor and now everyone in our congregation wants one. Having the Hebrew and English side by side is great. It is helping me improve my Hebrew while studying the scriptures. This is a must for anyone who is seriously looking for a great study tool."
3,"Clear, concise, and useful","This is a serviceable reference, and any environmentalist will find that it is a useful book to keep handy when encountering an unfamiliar word or phrase. The book seems to be comprehensive, with every term you could imagine. The entries are also very clear, with succinct explanations that favor being clear over being wordy.The editor did make a couple of odd format choices, however. The font size is much larger than I'm used to seeing in a dictionary or glossary, and there are very few pictures or illustrations of any kind. I think that more pictures would have made thumbing through the guide a much more enjoyable experience, and the large font size contributes to the book's somewhat cumbersome size. I don't mind my dictionary being big; I just think it should be that size in the service of giving me as many entries as possible.Criticisms aside, this is a very useful guide, and I do recommend this or something like this for anyone with an interest in ecology."
3,Fun,"I agree entirely with the point made by the other reviewer - actually Weaver's ""What Are the Odds?"" is far worse. There are ten pages of jokes for every page of useful data.I read this book not for enlightenment but for entertainment. It's a fun way to waste time."
3,Too Funny for the Statistical Neophyte,"I think the author spent the better part of his effort trying to channel Dave Barry into his writing. The effort failed and thus failed in the grander goal of educating the reader on the topic of statitics via the use of humor. Streamlining the jokes would reduce the book to a fraction of its size and maybe deliver some of the lessons from their imprisonment in a joke world. Ironically, additonal graphs and tables would have helped the reader in following the argument. If you are interested in a beginners guide to statistics, a more traditional text is preferable."
4,Classic and Dud,"The classics are the majority.Full tracklisting:1. Walking on sunshine - Rockers Revenge & Donnie Calvin 2. Don't make me wait - Peech Boys 3. White lines (don't do it) - Grandmaster Flash & Melle Mel 4. Hip hop be bop (Don't stop) - Man Parrish 5. Rockit - Hancock, Herbie 6. Smurf - Brunson, Tyrone 7. In the bottle - COD 8.

Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the wheels of steel - Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five[Don't Make Me Wait in a 10 minute version by the Peech Boys.]"
5,Great Book,Higgins has an amazing ability to let his characters tell the story in a realistic way. Great book.
4,A MUST READ!!,"Anyone who's ever gotten junk e-mail or heard the on-going stories mentioned by the author should read this. Mr. Williams has thoroughly researched each of these myths and exposes them for what they are. And with the computer explosion of the last 10 years,it seems that most of these myths,legends,etc. will be with us for a long time to come. Also he properly criticizes the Christian media for helping to spread some of these myths. Doesn't anybody ever check the source of these things?? An informative yet fun book to read. Would be great for a Sunday School class to spend some time studying. Pastors too,should read this book. A source for many sermons I'm sure."
4,Its cool for a while up front then the later tracks hit you,"Ya Solid State is a leading avenger in Christian Hard Music but ever since they released last years Solid 4 I'm getting kinda worried ever since Heavy Metal Kings Zao,Living Sacrifice, and The Agony Scene have left Solid State. Solid has left its State! Granted the tracks from Norma Jean, Demon Hunter, The Chariot, Figure Four, Haste The Day where awesome and the desent tracks from Stretch, Showbreed (solids new band), and Emery which weren't to bad, and the rest if you ask me were trash! Hi my name is Underoath or Dead Poetic and we have this sing/scream combo that is to die for! Oh,please if you want real music check out the greats like ZAO, Living Sacrifice, Extol, and As I Lay Dying. If your optomistic try out the cd you might like something on this cd!"
1,Don't buy this stuff!!,I bought this as a replacemnt to my existing Toshiba adapter that lasted 8yrs.This one died in 6months..Be aware..just don't buy these duplicate stuff..the circuitry inside was cooked.
5,Top compilation,"I'm amazed that this is the first review, as this is a great compilation. To me this vol 3 along with vol 7 is the best of the cafe del mar series. Easy listening and a harmonious mix with some piano music a la cafe style, some light techno, a few dance tracks, some ambient and some jazzy tunes. Uplifting and worth listening to."
5,wow,"This is incredible, keeps you interested all the way through, a must have for anyone with a small store that wants to project a good feeling smoldering in the background."
3,A good book of only limited use,"This book describes in a very detailed and easily digestible fashion the complete transformation of a standard 911S 2.2 into a competition car to be used in track racing.It is a fine book for anyone who owns a car of that period, but it is of limited use for any owners of later 911's, especially the ones who own SC's of Carrera 3.2's, because it covers only this specific car. I had expected a book which gives more general advice about modifying various 911 models into racing vehicles.The other drawback is that it mentions mostly US-suppliers for certain parts and upgrades, which means again that it is of limited use for any non-US resident owners of 911's."
4,Good bang for the buck,"I own many books on 911's and this one is does a pretty good job of summarizing some useful modifications in an easy to read, home mechanic way. There are many modifications out there for 911's and this book is the authors opinion on a 'good setup' for a 911, which is exactly what the author intended it to be. Overall worth buying if your just getting into a 911, but nothing new for some of the seasoned hard core enthusiasts. Happy with the book, keeping it."
2,no se concreto la compra,no se concreto la compra pero muy buena la respuesta en la devolucion del pago
2,Too many flashbacks,"I agree with Morris. In all of his recent books, Johnstone seems to be running out of material and filling out his stories with excessive retelling of what has gone on in previous books in a series. This seems to apply to all of his past series and looks like 30% plus is flashbacks (retelling segments of previous books) where they are obviously used as page fillers."
2,Whodunit... Wait I think I've got it.,"Jecks is certainly prolific and has many books to his credit now but when the word jail slips in instead of gaol, I begin to wonder how well researched these novels are. Well we start going down a convoluted plot and when it seems likely that one will never guess from clues whom we have as the culprit, process of elimination of characters that we have met leaves the solution very evident too early. Once you figure out the whodunit, because there are not enough red herrings for a reader, though certainly for our heroes, waiting for those heros to catch up is quite painful. Cadfael, where are you?"
4,A boy's struggles with the neighborhood tryant.,"This book captures the essence of two young boys' fears and frustrations as they explore life on the cusp of puberty. In unusual fashion, the protagonist and the bully are not necessarily good and evil, in that order. As these two traverse territory wholly unexplored in their lives, they find insight, joy, and a few misadventures along the way. A must for those, ""on the cusp""."
3,It may not play,"I bought the CD, but unfortunately it will not play on my house player - due to the copy protection format being used. BE AWARE - you may not be able to play this cd. IF you play it on your PC, disable autorun first or it will attempt to install copy protection software on your pc."
4,The Melodic Speed Of Song,"There is no doubt about the melodic contemporary feelings that Coldplay have showcased in their music for the past several years. After the worldwide massave message A Rush Of The Blood To The Head has brought from the band, they really have done it again with another very soulful track. Chris Martin & company's latest Speed Of Sound, the lead-off single from the bands third release X&Y; is a remarkable uplifting feeling of a song. It is just great to listen to and is just a pure delight. The feeling is similarly showcased as a mix from other great singles like Clocks, and Trouble, but it is just captured so well from the alternative feelings. It is just one of the best tracks released so far this year.Song: B+"
2,What Happened?,"This single is off Coldplay's X&Y; Album. The album itself is boring and Speed Of Sound is just a marginal hit song. In my opinion, when I listen to Speed Of Sound I wonder if it's really not a piano and just a MIDI recording?Buy some classic Coldplay single's. Buy this single and the new album just for a laugh."
3,"Ok, but only just!","The first of the series with the intriguing titles starring the undeniably attractive Junko Miyazono, and probably the best of the three. The story here seems a little less predictable than in the two sequels, and therefore stays a little bit more interesting.Junko Miyazono's swordplay is slow and cumbersome, and the camerawork barely helps it at all. Don't get your hopes up: The sequels are worse, the third part being just a complete waste of time. There are large numbers of excellent Japanese movies around, so keep shopping."
5,The wonder of numbers...,"What's a pig and a dog to do when Minerva's School of Dance is in trouble? All they need to do is recover the missing numbers from the garbage cans and bring them back and help place them on a rack. Without the numbers, the dancers will not be able to count their steps or even remember which stage to practice on. An entertaining video for preschoolers in which music and numbers go hand in hand.Favorite quotes:- DOG: ""What sweet music!"" PIG: ""Sweets? I wonder if they have any chocolate around here?""- BIRD: ""All we need to make a ten is a one and a zero. And we have lots of zeros hanging around.""- MAN IN SHOP: ""Where did that pig and that dog come from?"" PIG: ""Aah, let's get outta here!""- TURTLES: ""One, two, cha cha cha, three, four, cha cha cha..."""
3,sweetleaf,tastes just like the eqaute ot other one are but nothing worsei use it in cooking so yeah it is suppose to be really good
4,"Pretty, soft, and matches set","I like this sheet because it is soft, washes well and matches the set. I've only washed it a few times because my son still mostly sleeps in his bassinet. It does have some wrinkles when I take it out of the dryer, but when I put in on the mattress I hardly notice them. It fits very tightly on my mattress, which makes it a little difficult to get on but keeps it in place. It does cost more than solid color knit sheets, but it's worth it if you like everything to match."
3,Too pricey for its quality,"Typically, baby clothes and baby's linens are washed before use. And so I did. This sheet was so badly wrinkled after drying. The fabric felt coarser than the bedsheets I use myself. I mean I would not think the fabric is gentle enough for baby's skin. So, I ended up ironing it so it wouldn't feel as coarse; but, who would want to iron bedsheets and go through the hassle of doing so?"
4,True to our nature; while being fluent and assertive.,"As I read this book, I, without acknowledgment, became a prisoner. Lost in worlds, too many times dismissed; of tragedy, in hopelessness and exasperation struggling for my central stability. Longing for an insight which only comes from confinement. To believe a government's (ours) coup could insistantly(to this day) project such a non-chalant attitude towards out-right dehumanizing treatment, is absurd, and can only come from... well.. our government. No, I am not an adversary of American government just a skeptic of it's ""Agenda."" (Just like our population) We are people and so are convicts. What is incarceration other than devices?"
5,Nice!,"This was a gift, and the recipient really seemed to enjoy it. I love this group picture of the guys from Entourage."
1,poor video editing,"this concert is very hard to watch due to the scene changes every 2 seconds. i bought his other dvd's hoping this would change, however it's the same crap on those shows too...don't waste your money"
3,Still worthy,"3 1/2Consistent, if slightly under-performed album still makes the grade for six strong tracks of eclectic, progressive instrumentation jamming, minus some of the detracting humor which sometimes infests Gong albums."
4,The best Gong's work without Daevid Allen,"Produced by Nick Mason, this album is pretty good. Of course, it's not a masterpiece such ""Angel's Egg"" or ""Camembert Electrique"", but it's enjoyable. The highlights are ""Bombooji"" (have a nice trip to Middle East with Didier Malherbe by your side!) and ""Cat in the Clark's Shoes""."
3,this costume is SHORT!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for halloween, to go with my Pebbles costume. He is 6'1'' and about 220 lbs. We picked the XL size because this is his shirt size. The costume was plenty wide enough, but very short and rode up, which looked sort of awkward and was uncomfortable. Whoever designed this should know the XL demographic often includes tall people, especially in a men's costume! In the end he wore it to the party, and after initial pictures were taken just shrugged out of the top part, so he was left wearing a tshirt(he had it on underneath) and the BammBamm shorts. 3 stars because it served it's purpose and was very affordable."
1,Nothing Special,"This is really nothing special at all, it is 'wicth' after all, a series that is not at all 'good' in anyway to start with. The cartoons and drawings of the characters are poor, no artistic talent was put into the creation of this series. The books also feature the same poor art work as well, so again nothing special at all. Also one has to think and 'believe' the creators of 'witch' somewhat copied the whole concept otherwise, the girl 'will' looks and is alot like 'Willow' from Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and this will is a poor copy of something that is great, that being Buffy The Vampire Slayer series, which is maybe too much for children, who enjoy cartoons, so for them and for their parents, I would suggest strongly, against this poor talent stuff, and go with something much better, like The Winx Club.~Amy"
4,Poetry is a true Language!,"I enjoyed the realism of this poetry, as a writer myself I know what good and bad times are, and when you write about them, you pour your soul into it! I can tell that is what Ana Castillo did!!!!! I loved it, hope you do too!"
2,Its ok if you are like in love with tirck other wise no,"There are Three good songs on this entire album F***in' around, D.O.D.D. Thugs about and thats it so if you want to spend fifteen or twenty bucks on three or four songs buy this cd."
1,worst album ever herd,this album is garbage. trick daddy aint definatly not fo tha thugs. this album has poor production wack beats and his lyrics pretty much suck.he has no flow and his voice constantly goesfrom a different pitch to another. he should jus quit the rap game cuz hes bad.
2,First review for this album,"Well...see im not really in to trick daddy's style in all, but i was bored and felt like hearin some new stuff, so i borrowed this from a friend. I listened to it and was like....WOW!! This guy cannot rap for nuthin. Did u see him on the bassment this guy was like ""oh i aint goin freestyle ima keep it real,"" I'm like....yo this guy is garbage. Well back to the cd, there aint really anything that u can feel, its just like the same ol junk, nothin original, just annoying. The only good thing about this is that he talks about the world, rather than cash, cars, and junk like that. but the cd is terrible. GO BUY THAT TUPAC CD PEACE!!!"
1,This Sickens Me,"Alright, honestly. Something has to be pointed out here. Trick Daddy and Lil Jons cover of Crazy Train IS NOT in the least bit creative. Crazy Train was a classic song, and all they did was take the beginning riff, make it electronic, put it over a sample, loop is for 4 minutes and throw some mindless ""Yeah, What, Okays"" into the mix. ANYBODY could do that. Is it really excruciatingly painful to write your own song, instead of ripping off everybody elses music and sticking your own crap on top? Or how about forming a coherent sentence? The yeahs, whats and okays get old very fast. And yes...I do realize he had to get permission to do this song, and I cant believe that the record label let him do it. This ridiculous song, along with Battle For Ozzfest and The Osbournes really makes me fear Ozzy is becoming nothing more than another MTV icon."
3,Solid album!,"i thing trick daddy is a good rapper and this album is good, if you are a true rap fan u should add this to your collection. there are some fire songs here, like, 'let's go' and 'children's song', i can't remember the rest of the songs, but beliave me it's a good album."
3,Decent Effort for Trick,"This effort from trick has a different sound to it. I prefer is ""www.thug.com"" and ""book of thugs"" days. His lyrical content is good, but his beats and production seem to be laggin somewhat. Overall a good cd to cruise to if you are goin for a short drive, becuase there is some filler."
2,"Could of been much, much better","First off let me just say that there is 2 thug matrimonys, the bootlegged and the one im reviewing here, and the bootlegged is much better. I gave this CD a 2 b/c not every song on here rides like his previous albums. Now this cd is far from garbage, but half of these songs are just soft. TDD's tyle seems very mainstream and pop compared to Based on a True Story and even Thug Holiday. F*cking Around, Let's Go, Gangsta Livin, U Neva Know, J.O.D.D., aint a thug, and down with the south are good songs, but songs like i wanna sing and childrens song are beyond horrible. Overall, if your not a long time TDD fan or like pop music buy this album, and if u are youll be disappointed with this album.GO FIND THE BOOTLEG. 10x'S BETTER"
5,trick daddy the thug master.,"trick daddy the thug master. Guest apperance by Lil Jon,T.I. ,Ludacris,twista,cee-lo,Ying yang twins and alot more. Good tracks like F***ing around,let go and others. it gets 3 out of 5."
3,Hey Blues and Rock Fan!,"""And most people like to create their own stuff"".Yeah, and where did Ozzy's rock come from? Who stole the soul? What's weighs more: a riff or a genre?""Music comes from human talent andnot lame sound effect machines"".Uh, a gee-tar is a ""sound-effect machine"" too, and one that lately can only produce retro-sounding bull****."
1,IF sEAseme sTreet HAD a thug....IT WOULD be TRICK!!!,"Wow...Let me first off tell you that I own all of tricks previous albums and Trick dropped the ball in a major way.You would think that With all of the up and comming compitetion and talent in the 305 (pitbull and dirtbag)Trick would drop FIRE...But at least the name of the album is fitting ""married to the streets"" he sounds like he's singing love songs to his wife mrs. Piggy.If you are a real trick fan i would suggest that you buy the only 3 good songs on iTunes.. He reminds me of snoop,good in the past and doing everthing he can to have 1 good hit single(like useing lil jon)fT.Lickadale FLrYn"
4,HMMMMM..... a little different sound for T Double D,"This is a pretty decent album from Trick Daddy. His flow on the album is good on all songs and he also did a good job at hitting all kinds of topics on this album. Everyone has heard the club hit ""Let's Go"" and we all know that, that is one hot single. On ""I Wanna Sang"" and ""The Children's Song"" Trick lets his sensitive side out which is okay, just as long as the whole album isnt that way. Some other solid tracks are ""F'n Around"" feat. T.I., ""Gangsta Livin"", ""J.O.D.D"" and ""Down Wit The South"" feat Ying Yang Twinz and Trina, and my favorite track is ""sugar"" feat Cee-lo and LudacrisOverall this is a pretty decent album from Trick, not as good as his other albums but it worth a listen. Fans of Trick should pick this up.The only thing I didnt like were the songs with Jazzy Pha... I dont think Trick sounds too good with those kind of beats but you should be your own judge."
4,CD Review...,"Thug Matrimony isn't all club beats but it does have some great beats on it. I like the CD, but if you are looking for more of his songs like Lets Go or Sugar, then this CD is not for you. Trick Daddy does have some more songs with a good beat but those two songs are really the only upbeat songs on it. Not to say because they are slower R&B/hiphop sounding that they are bad. I actually enjoy them as much as his upbeat songs. If you have always been a Trick Daddy fan this CD is for you if you however are newer to Trick Daddy and are wanting songs like Sugar look elsewhere. Not all club beats."
5,f#$k all the haters,all of the songs are well produced the lyrics are very deep who else in this rap game talks to our young ones like trick does trick still has a lot to give and he is not going no where so get used to it haters
3,Rap from a red state worthy of 3 1/2 Mics,"Lets start Firing off the smoke here are my reviews the First song has a No Nann type of beat and is greatly titled ""F***** Around"" the next song is a single and is a cover of the beat on an old Ozzy Osbourne song ""Lets Go"" the song after that I should state I liked ""U Neva Know""Next up comes a good one titled ""These are the days"".""Hold on"" I felt was a standout on the album ""Sugar"" was good.This CD has some fried Chicken feel to it a real southern and a really country feel to it.Not that bad at times he sounds like Petey Pablo even.I liked itLyrics 8 Production 9 X Factor 7 Classic 8 Replay 7Total=7.5 out of 10 Fingers for Mr.Thug of the South"
3,Just average,"Due to the hype of the first single ""Lets Go"" I was expecting a lot more from this CD. Most of the songs besides ""Lets Go"" are average and different from anything Trick Daddy has ever done. I would say just listen to the album before you buy it because I think I wasted my money on this. But Trick Daddy is still a good artist."
2,"Boy, this book takes forever!!","I must agree with the other reviewers -- this book is good, however, it moves so slow. Like another reviewer, the only reason I finished it was to see what happened with the ghost.Also, another problem I had was when Mereli lost her virginity. (If she did! Ms. Coffman doesn't really say yay or nay.) There was nothing to lead up to such an interlude. Also, we didn't get to know Meleri's thoughts on losing her virginity.I will say though the book got better after the first 225 pages. But even though, I was yawning throughout the book."
4,"Nice Read, Pretty Good Story With a Ghost","I won't comment about the entire book because Ms. Klausner did a good job of it. What bothered were inconsistencies in the book. Passages that were obviosuly placed at the wrong place in the book. Some ideas were began but never fully developed and further pursued. At certain points I had to stop and go back and re-read. It is never explained why Melari never met Philip the night she was supposed to do so. Also, Melari never told Robert that Philip had come by while he was away from home. Parts of this were not very clear, although I did enjoy the story. It was not one of those ""I hate you"" sort of stories between hero and heroine which I absolutely despise. The lead chearacters have disagreements but this ""hate"" stuff turns me off. This book doesn't."
2,Really disliked this book,This was the only Elaine Coffman I have ever read so I cannot speak for her other books but I thought these caracters were poorly developed. It was almost as if the story was being related by an adolescent girl. The main caracters jump from tangent to tangent. There were all sorts of dangling plot lines and personality shifts. I just plain didn't like it. Unfortunately I bought 2 of her other books at the same time because I thought they might be related. I will force myself to read them to be fair but I am not looking forward to it.
1,NOT THE BAGS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE!,"I went to great lengths to research this product and make sure that it would fit a particular trash can (Rubbermaid Brut Rollout) and these bags are not wide enough to actually fit the can. We waited over a month to get them and then they are the wrong size. The bag is heavy and clear/frosted and is very deep but they are tall and narrow at the mouth. They are advertised as 38"" but that is their diagonal measurement - not the depth or width of the product."
4,Informative text book,I am using this for a class that I am taking to help better understand the Kabbalah. It's the fourth book our class has used over the years and I find it informative and easy to read .
5,18-year old dog still taking Glucosamine DS,My 18-year old maltese-poodle mix has been taking NaturVet Glucosamine DS Time Release with MSM and Chondroitin since she was 14 1/2 years old. It has helped keep her active and comfortable. She gets it before she goes to bed at night and she thinks she is getting a treat instead of medicine. I would recommend this product for any dog starting to show signs of arthritis.
3,We don't know!,"We buy this product because it is natural and not made in China! But, we don't really know if it has any healing attributes! We give it to our dog, because the vet recommends it. I break it up and put it in with her dry food and she eats them! Other than that, we can't really rate this product high, until we know it actually works!"
4,"love the restaurant, love the book!","Interesting info also given with some delicious recipes. Not for the ""Semi-homemade"" kind of cook. No gourmet ingredients necessary; truffle oil is readily available in most supermarkets."
5,A forgotten classic,"This book ""reached out"" to me from a disheveled rack of paperbacks in Gatwick Airport around 1976, a time when I was going through my own re-visioning of the world, what has later come to be called a ""spiritual emergency"", and it became a healing influence for me, bridging my own paranoid (para = ""beside"" + noia = ""mind"") fear-ridden thinking with a possibility of a positive paranoia. I dare say this book would continue to resonate with many, were it still in print."
5,My Go-To Source,"I'm mildly dyslexic (and hence enjoy jokes that begin: So a fella walks into a bra), and one of the things I struggle with are directions for stitching things. Most books about embroidery or crochet are very difficult for me to deal with and it takes me awhile to get the concept the author is trying to explain. (Note: once I get the first stitch, problem solved, but sometimes getting there is hard.)This book is clear as can be, and if you have no issues with dyslexia I'm sure it'll make picking up on various stitches a breeze. The projects in this book also look nice, though I'm not interested in doing other people's projects, but if you are, they are quite pretty."
4,COMPLETE BOK OF EMBROIDERY,THIS IS AN EXCELENT BOOK WITH LOTS OF INFORMATION AND GREAT INSTRUCTIONS.I AM PLEASED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION.THANKS AMAZON FOR FINDING IT FOR ME.
5,Great,The book arrived very fast and in excellent condition. Thanks for the great product and service.
2,Bread Book,As a bread baking book excellent. However the author includes a dedication to devils and demons which I find offensive - I presume this is to do with his religious leanings but I bought a cookery book not a religious book.
3,Not for serious bakers,"I don't know the lore and culture behind this book, but as a serious bread book it's a joke. The recipes will give you good bread and pastries, and it has more whole wheat recipes which is great. However, it is nothing like any serious, scientific bread book (my favorite is Hamelman ""Bread""). If you want a 70's vibe get this book, but if you're seriously into learning everything bread, like I was when I got it, this is not the book for you."
5,One of two cookbooks I'd take to a desert island,"I bought this book in the early 70's, before I graduated from High School, and learned to bake from it and from two lovely ladies. The two ladies have long since left my life, but the book is still on my kitchen shelf. I pull it out every time I bake bread. The pages are stained and torn, and the covers are held on with tape.Mr. Brown instructs not only in the making of food for the body, but also for the soul. Every time I open his book, it takes me back to those heady days of spiritual searching. Although I am no closer to Enlightenment, the work of the yeast and the energy of a day's baking makes the product vastly more satisfying than any commercial loaf.If I am ever stranded on a desert island, I would want this book along, even if I had no supply of flour!"
5,Tassajara (and Ed Brown) stand the Test of Time,"My current copy of the Tassajara Bread Book is a 1970 edition, and it is still my favorite (along with Tassajara Cooking, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be available). It has stood the test of time over the years, too many great recipes to just single out one. The Whole Wheat Pancakes, with some fresh blueberries added, is my favorite way to spoil guests. The best thing about the Tassajara books is that they indeed show you a method for cooking or baking, not just recipes to be followed.Oil stains, flour stains, unidentifiable traces of the years, I don't think I'll ever part with my original copy, but with binding paste falling out now each time I open it and the cover unattached, I think it's time to get an updated copy. You won't go wrong with this book!"
4,healthy and delicious breads and pastries,"I just got this book a couple of days ago so have only made 2 recipes.One was perfect; the kolaches and the other tasted great (3-layer corn bread) but it never set up.Cooking time stated it would take 50 mins, that the batter would be very runny, and this particular recipe happened by accident. With that said I baked it for over a hour and a half and it was still pretty mushy. Since I was pairing this with chili, I just put a slice of the bread in the bottom of the chili bowl so the sogginess wasn't as noticeable. If I make this again, I'll try and tweak ingredients and proportions to see if that helps the consistency. Anyone else make this? I'd like some hints. In any case I do love the fact that most of the pastry recipes use molasses, brown sugar and honey instead of refined white sugar.Other than the cornbread mishap, This book truly is a bread bible."
5,Get things flowing!,"The Tassajara Bread Book has been part of my library for at least ten years. Upon first purchasing this gem with its gently textured cover and hand drawn sketches, I fell in love with the poetry that Edward Espe Brown, the author, offered in the opening of this cookbook.His words, insights, and even the recipes themselves carry with them a humbleness and gratitude towards cooking, food, and life.I'm amazed to say that only last week did I actually used one of the recipes (page 100, Bran Muffins) and it was scrumptious--not to mention helpful in getting things flowing (if you know what I mean!).I intend to use many more recipes in the upcoming months. Next on the list is Corn Muffins (still on page 100--I figure why mess with a good thing)."
5,Only buy this if you want to make the best bread on earth,"'nuff said. The process is a little longer than common bread recipes and disdains the electric mixer variety, but is relatively easy in the kneading department and gives enough explanation of what ingredients do that you can vary them to suit your taste or needs. My original book is now barely readable, having absorbed its share of oil, butter, flour, and whatever else was handy or being used. I have pictures of my daughter as a child ""helping"" me mix the dough in her jammies, something she did so much she knew the recipe by heart before kindergarten...and just last month my wife was taking pictures of my granddaughter starting on the same path. Different jammies though. These are ""teachable moments"" for me, inculcate the notion that you do all the preparation work with care so the final product is what you want rather than being sloppy in preparation, hoping to fix the final product later. More than just a bread book for me."
5,Tassajara is the best method.,"The Tassajara brings out the finest in all breadbaking techniques. Following the directions are easy, and the end results have been without fail! I grew up watching my dad bake bread, and when the day came in 1978 that I needed to bake on my own, his gift to me was the Tassajara Bread Book. I've carried it with me through a(failed) marriage in which I never baked a loaf of bread, but when I wanted to read or imagine a loaf of bread, I could bring out the Tassajara and there it was! Whenever I find a recipe for bread to try now, I check Tassajara first and adapt to Ed's method. It works everytime, making the most delightful bread I've ever created."
5,Our old faithful for breadmaking,"This Kindle version is a replacement for the Tassajara Bread Book we got as a wedding present in 1974. Its pages are much floured and sometimes stuck together, so it was time for a new one. This book is how we learned to bake bread - the detailed instructions are clear enough for any beginner. After that, the variations are endless and creativity is encouraged. The basic recipe makes about five loaves, but they freeze well, and we've never had trouble giving them away."
5,The Best Even after 35 Years !,I bought this book in 1970 when I was 20 years old and am so happy to see that it is still in print so that another generation of cooks can learn from it. Simply stated - it is the best.
5,The One and Only,"With the possible exception of ""The Sharks"", this is the most famous of all the National Geographic nature documentaries.Jane Goodall has spent most of her life studying the chimpanzees, and here she shares what she has learned over the years about the behavior of a particular group of the primates. Touching, heartbreaking and frightening at times, the video's greatest moment may be when we see the chimps getting a meal of termites with...a tool. By the end, you'll feel as if you know many of the chimps. Quite an experience."
1,no......,"Don't waste your money, you will spend your time standing there waiting for this to stop so you can wind it up again. The music only lasts a minute or less."
3,~ Cute to look at but..... ~,"I'm a first time mommy-to-be and fell in love with the Malawi set. Of course, I had to have everything that went along with it. Upon setting it up (and throwing all packaging away), we found that the mobile didn't work well with the crib we bought. Ours has a sloped shape end and the mobile will only fit on either side, not in the middle where I wanted it. I worry that when our little boy joins us he'll get a kink in his neck from looking to the side to see the mobile. I anticipate taking it down & looking for something that fits better and am disappointed because it looks so cute and also because we'll lose $39.99 since I threw the packaging away. A lesson learned on throwing the packaging away....... Hope this helps!"
3,"Cute, but.....","We live on Maui, so our selection of baby bedding was somewhat limited. Scouring online websites with seeminly hundreds of sets led us to this one. It is so adorable! We are truly happy with it. However, regarding the mobile: its only downside is that the song it plays is sooooo short!! Granted we haven't set up the new crib yet, so I'm not sure how the stabilization factor will fair, as I read was a complaint from another reviewer. Anyway, other than the brevity of the song, it is nice to look at!"
2,Cute but doesn't last long,"This is a cute mobile and it is nice when it running. The problem is, it only plays one song and lasts about 3 minutes. I would recommend find another mobile that plays music long and with more of a variety."
1,The music does not last long,"This would be a great mobile if the music last longer. The song only plays approximately 3-5 minutes. Before I can even sit down good and attempt to do something, anything, (fold laundry perhaps) the mobile has already stopped. My son does like the mobile, however he becomes quite irritable when it stops so suddenly. What good is this product if the music doesn't play long enough to soothe your child? I've seen some other reviews on other mobiles that I am about to purchase, perhaps the one with the remote that last for 20-30 minutes, now THAT makes sense!If the mobile were not a gift this is something I would NOT have purchased!"
2,"Aesthetically pleasing, but poorly put together","Again, this is becoming a common title for this Kids Line theme. Beautiful products, but not put together well. In this case, our mobile came unassembled, then we had to tie on each animal with about 1/8' piece of ribbon. My wife purchased more ribbon to make it work. A nice piece, but if we had it to do over again, we would've just gotten one of those aquariums that attach to the crib."
2,Cute... but BIG,"I purchased the mobile but ended up selling it on Ebay... it is too big for the crib, it hung down so low that my son could pull on it and bring it down on top of him. It is cute, but I found a jungle mobile that was smaller and matched really nice with the set..."
4,Great however,"This product is wonderful, however my only complaint is that it should play a longer time when you wind up to play the music. It doesn't last long enough. However the baby loves it and it is really cute."
2,Malawi - Mobile didnt work for us,"our babies room is set up in all of the Malawi set but the crib we got has very thick bars and rails so the huge dial doesnt have engough room to secure it to the crib. i wanted to use it but now we are looking for a new one, plus the music doesnt last long enough. oh well"
3,new mommy,"My son loves his mobile. He smiles as soon as the song plays and the animals start to move, but it doesn't last long. The song is very short, and I usually have to wind it several times for him."
2,Too short!,"The mobile looks great and my son LOVES it- but after you wind it all the way up, it only lasts a few minutes. Therefore, don't count on it as entertainment for your baby, just use it for decoration."
2,Sweet but way too Short!,"The mobile is adorable, but it drives my 6-month-old son nuts when the music stops, too! It's the traditional soothing lullaby song (my 7-yr-old likes to wind it up just to listen) but it does wind down within a few minutes. Too much money for little more than a decoration."
4,work gloves,"Never be without a pair of work gloves. Decent price for a large number of gloves. This way I can have a pair stashed wherever I need them - shop, trunk of vehicle, porch, garden shed, etc. - without having to SEARCH for my gloves."
3,"Great edge, bad adhesive","The edge is great, as it really cushions the corners. The adhesive however is not sticky enough as it started coming off already on some of the furniture. But I am still happy with the purchase. I'll just look for a better adhesive."
4,Just Terrific,"This is an example of what the fruits of scholarship should yield: careful, concise, clear, simple but uncompromised prose, moving from insight to insight, nothing gratuitous. If only such a book were available for every period in cultural history. Bainton renders the phenomena surrounding the Reformation so lucidly; really, in its own careful way, a small masterpiece."
2,Better books are available,"So-so textbook history of the Reformation, with a decidedly Lutheran slant."
5,"Great Expose of the Los Angeles Beach Bike Path, I Learned a Lot.","I live in the LA area and love the beach, I didn't know the path along the beach was so interesting. I would recommend to those of you who get to enjoy it or are coming to Los Angeles to watch this show so you will be able to take full advantage of this special path. I mainly rollerblade and push the baby, it is a great work out and day out. So walk it, bike it or blade, have fun. Great show, thanks for the great info."
4,This music transcends all boundries!,I am very impressed with the music! I recommend it for a gift to anyone for any occassion. Keep your eye on them because we will be seeing more of them on a much larger platform!
4,a great start for Jag Star's Beginning,"Hearing this album, I was really impressed with the musicality, the songwriting and the talent of this band. I am sure to be keeping my eyes glued to them. Each song brings up a variety of emotions and with firing drums, beautiful vocals and an eerie violin. Good stuff!"
3,Love hip hop abs,"I love the Yoga Booty Ballet workouts. I could not get the moves at first but after a few weeks everything clicked. I love to dance.What i like best about the workouts is that you don't do the same moves everyday. They mix up the workouts. One day your working out with the squishy ball, anotehr day with bands.Cons: I am not a yoga fan. They start off each workout doing like ten minutes of meditation. That part is boring and I usually end up fast forwarding to the workout. You may need to supplement a little of your own cardio in addition to the workouts because after you fast forward the meditation parts the workouts usually range from 15 minutes to 35 minutes.Pros: Great music, love the dancing, routines are unique, and you get in a great stretch."
5,Every household needs these!,"I read about these a while back and finally got them for myself. What a help! Just having in our tool box ready when something falls into an odd tight space... they are not used every day, but when they ARE used... what a relief to have in the house!!"
5,A Fantastic Book !,"This book has many many great pictures of Xena, Gabrielle and the other cast. Very informative and a nice book to have with you if you are a fan of Xena. If you read this and don't really think much of the writing, then the pictures will surprise you and it is really worth buying... This book is a must have for all XENA FANS... Until then, battle on Xenites..! Al-la-la-la-la-la-la!"
2,A Fine Tie-In But ...,"As much as I hate to disagree with the glowing reviews of other readers I found this book a disappointment, especially when compaired to the same book written of its friendly-competitor ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"". While the H:TLJ Companion is detailed and has in depth interviews with both lead actors (Sorbo & Hurst) we pretty much get Lucy Lawless in Xena's Companion, and that's it. While Miss Lawless is stunning and a wonderful actress as Xena her in book comments aren't enough to hold the episode guide together. I, personally, would have loved to hear from Renee O'Conner (Gabrielle) on many of the key episodes she and Lawless did together. Admittedly, the production notes and comments on costumes and background information is intriguing -- but also flawed. Now that ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" is heading into its fifth season let's hope fans get a more up to date companion book ... and one that is a bit more accurate."
3,The Official Guide to the Xenaverse,"I bought this book, because I read very good reviews about it, but I found the news very old, and the book is not complete as it includes only season 1 and 2 and not all the main charachters of the show.I like Lucy's comments a lot, but I would have loved a more complete book, and more updated."
5,VERY OINFORMATIVE,"THIS VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK IS MY BIBLE!! IT TELLS YOU JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CHARACTERS, EPISODES, ACTORS, AND EVEN ABOUT TECHNICAL STUFF LIKE STUNTS, EDITING, SOUND AND BY THE GODS, EVEN LIGHTING!?! ONLY ONE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS BOOK IS THE FACT THAT IT'S A LITTLE OUTDATED IT COVERS THE FIRST TWO SEASONS WITH IN DEPTH DETAIL, INTERESTING FACTS AND LUCY'S TAKE ON EVERY EPISODE! MY SUGGETION TO THE AUTHOR IS TO RELEASE A VOLUME 2 BECAUSE I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE WAY HE COVERED THE FIRST 50 EPISODES!BEST XENA BOOK AVAIL.!!"
2,5-Teir Single Use Cake Stand,The product wasn't what the bride though it would be. It was foam and cardboard and she was looking for something that did not take anytime to decorate. The seller was great about the return even through it was a special order (which we did not know). The seller credited my account in a very timely matter.
2,Not good at all!,"The title says itself, very easy. IT'S FOAM! there was no product details about this cake stand, and the only one review i didn't notice. The picture looks so adorable, but naturally it's very very auwful, I don't know what I am going to do. This cake cake stand is not going to hold the weight of a wedding cake, I am afraid it will fall apart."
5,In the Final Analysis,"If there were only one book i could take with me on the last leg of this earthly journey, it would be this one. This is an unflinching view of life from the vantage point of very old age."
1,The Measure Of My Days,"In attempting to complete an assigment, I purchaced this book. I was pleased to find such positive reviews. After I recieved this book I started to attempt to read and understand this author. I am sorry to say but I should have choose a different author. Much of the book was writen in a form of a women's ponderings with no real frame of referance to work from. I feel that this is because of the education of the author. When the author actually did give framework like when she was with her grandson and how he looked at the world with fresh eyes it was easy to relate and understand where she was comeing from. I found that at the end of the assignment, I did something with a book that I never do and that was throw it away."
2,Too many little seeds...,"I love Goldenfeast products, and that is the parrot food manufacturer whose products I usually buy in bulk. I thought I'd try a different blend. What a waste... way too many tiny seeds, probably a quarter of the container is seeds too small for my parrots. Too small to use it as it is or cooked...This might be appropriate for song birds, canaries, finches, or even love birds, but not my Pionus. What a waste of money..."
1,Contains CHLORINE! (SUCRALOSE / Splenda),"First off, This drink contains Chlorine (Sucralose is 66% Chlorine).I drank some of this last night and thought, ""Why does this taste like a 'Diet' drink if it has H.F.Corn-Syrup??"".So I read the label, and see ""Sucralose"".FYI: Sucralose =A) 1-sugar molecule [0 (ZERO) calories, because it's from ""sugar beets"", which contain a type of sugar the body does NOT recognize, which is problematic in itself]B) 2-CHLORINE molecules!!Sucralose has been known to wipe out intestinal/digestive friendly bacteria very quickly.Within a couple months of use, you will have ~50% drop in intestinal flora.This is why Sucralose causes weight gain... but that's the mildest of the adverse effects.MANY COMPANIES ARE PUTTING BOTH ASPARTAME AND SUCRALOSE IN NON-DIET FOOD/DRINK PRODUCTS!!!BEWARE - ASPARTAME WAS KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAIN TUMORS IN LAB ANIMALS BEFORE IT WAS MADE INTO A SWEETENER!RESEARCH ""EXCITO-TOXINS"" PLEASE!!! DON'T SUPPORT CORPORATIONS WHO USE POISONS IN FOOD."
1,Fattening,"I like the original V8 drink. It tastes great.The new V8 Spalsh Juice, however, does not. It also contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, which is the main ingredient added to American food that makes Americans obese. So, I'll stick with the original version.As a side note, I tried to rate this product with zero stars, but that option is not available, so I had to add a star so that I could write this review."
5,really super to smooth out hair without weighing it down (if you have fine or thin hair),use about a quarter size dollop and run thru wet hair and then blow dry...will help smooth out slightly kinky hair (my hair has more grey in it now and appears slightly wiry while still being fly away hair even though it is colored. Also helps with humid days....use more if hair is thick--leaves hair polished looking without weighing it down and keeps it from being fly-away frizzy
4,works well,When applied to wet hair the product tames frizzes well. Don't use too much or a build up will surface quickly. Not so great on dry hair.
5,Very Pleased!,This product is exactly what I was looking for and at the same price (with shipping) that I would have paid at the store. The product itself is amazing and gives my hair a great shine and it dries so great feeling soft with a light sweet smell to it. Absolutely one of my favorite products! It came very quickly in the mail and I'm happy with this purchase.
5,YUMM!!,"I am addicted to this stuff!!! Not only does it smell better than any other product ever created, but it makes your hair so soft, so shiny and sooo awesome!! My stylist used to use this stuff on me over the winter because I has such a static problem with my hair. I ended up buying it on my own and fell in love. It smells and works great. You only need a little amount and it definitely helps with humidity, static, frizz, dryness and dullness. Get this product! Whenever I mention it to my girlfriends they moan with excitement! I don't know any other hair product that creates a response like that! ;)"
2,Not for me...,"After reading mostly positive reviews for this product, I had high hopes for it. I have medium-length wavy/curly hair that I brush-straighten on a daily basis, so this sounded great! Unfortunately, it's not so great. It adds a little bit of control, but does nothing to smooth/lusterize/de-frizz my hair...and, to boot, it makes my face break out every time I use it. The only reason I gave this two stars was because the fragrance is pleasant...not flowery (I HATE flowery fragrances), definitely fruity, and not so overpoweringly sweet that I couldn't stand it. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this product, especially if your face is sensitive or prone to allergic breakouts."
4,Tigi Smoothing Lusterizer,"My Beautician had initially used this product in my hair, and i instantly fell in love with it! A little bit goes a long way...you will only need a pea size amount for each section. This is a great product that gives the hair a sheen, smells very good, and defrizzes!"
5,Been using for years,"I've been using this stuff for years. I love ""product"" and have tried almost everything, but this is my number 1 all-time favorite. It never weighs my fine, wavy hair down, and the shine and softness are awesome. I live in fear that it will be discontinued someday!"
3,Still not sure,"Smells wonderful however, if I use too much it leaves my hair weighed down; I'm still practicing with this one ;)"
1,Doesn't work- Save your money,"I bought this with the Bed Head Recovery Shampoo/Conditioner set. I added the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product because of the great reviews. I wanted something to limit fly-aways and add softness and shine to my hair. I blow-dry and flat iron my hair daily.(I have straight to wavy hair that is dyed and 50% gray)I found that when I washed with the Bed HEad shampoo and conditioner and did not use the TIGI S Factor Smoothing product, my hair looked and felt better to the touch than when I used it. It didn't help with styling, frizz nor did it make my hair look healthier.The shampoo/conditioner alone work wonders- my hair looks and feels better than with any shampoo/conditioner combo I've ever used.Other reviewers said this smelled great. I didn't think so. I was okay- not OMG Amazing or anything like that. Again- the shampoo/conditioner smelled better by themselves.So that's my feedback- don't waste your money. This stuff isn't worth it."
1,i didn't like it,"I believe there are many products shipper and more efficiency than TIGI Factor, i have use it for more than 2 weeks daily but nothing changed !"
5,Great product,"I have very curly, frizzy hair, and it has been a challenge for me to find products that reduce frizz while not making my hair feel ""crunchy."" I put this in my hair after I air dry it a bit and the result is very smooth curls. I really like it and it smells delicious. I would recommend for anyone with dry or curly hair."
3,Smoothes but doesn't lusterize,"I have long straight hair and was looking for something to make my hair shiny and lustrous. This product eliminates flyaways and smoothes the hair, but it doesn't leave it looking lustrous. A little goes a long way, I use less than a dime size of product and it doesn't leave the hair slick, greasy, or weighed down. It does have a mild fruity fragrance that is powerful when you first put it on but fades after that. I'm still looking for something better."
4,love the shine,"This is a great hair product. It isn't greasy, it defrizzes my curly hair very well, and I use it to either style my hair curly or blow dry it straight. I especially love that it has a very subtle sparkle that adds shine to your hair. The only reason I won't be buying it more is because it contains parabens...a known carcinogen in many conventional hair products, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions. I'm off to the natural stuff!"
5,Highly Recommended,"The product makes hair shiny, smooth, and easy to manage. Will continue to order the product from now on."
1,this isint really a toy but i think it sucks that....,you have to have it to play with shell shocker and it takes 6 hours to charge but the good thing is that you get 6 hours of play time or a bit more but overal it gives you good play time if your not patshont id never sugest that you get shell shocker
3,Flexpak Dies Too Quick!,"After charging and using the flexpak in the shell shocker a few times, we could not recharge it. Common problem in the past, I thought by now it would be fixed, guess not. A real bummer."
4,Battery pack for shellshocker,We love the shell shocker. The battery pack doesn't last as long as we expected and it is difficult to tell when it is recharged. Also it is a little difficult to remove or replace.
1,battery not included,a $70 toy hmmmmmm... normal until you cant find the SPECIAL battery that is not included another $30 and no chance of finding it for at least a month after christmas
5,Fabulous,"I love this book. I received it within a week and I love all the different lessons on drawing dinosaurs, pencil rockets, etc..."
5,One of the best turn based games ever.,"By today's standards rather grainy, this was an exceptionally graphic game with fluid gameplay and storyline. I still occasionally pick up my old laptop and play this game (it doesnt play well on anything past xp). Highly recommend."
3,Good artwork,"I honestly found this book to be a disappointment. I expected a more thorough examination of ""combat skills, and tactics."" Unfortunately it is more a discussion of the various arms of a medieval army, infantry (which includes archers & gunners), cavalry, sappers (siege engines), and ships. There were various discussions of select battles and how each of these arms were used to win or lose the battle. There was a good discussion of tactics, but almost none of skills. The modern artwork is excellent. The line drawings were incredibly clear and accurate and quite informative. The color paints of the battles were excellent. The 19th artwork was an embarrassment. It was well written and a decently enjoyable read. The authors are clearly informed on the subject that they wrote about. But, what they wrote about isn't ""combat skills."""
5,A Good Source of Info,"If you're looking for a book on how the actual medieval battles were fought, then this is your book! If you're looking for a book on common tactics, training, armor, etc., then this is your book! ""Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World: Equipment, Combat Skills and Tactics"" is a great buy for anybody who is doing a school report, or just looking for a book on the subject for your own entertainment. It is well laid out and gives accurate and detailed accounts about medieval warfare, along with detailed illustrations of many of the most famous battles of the Medieval Era. A great buy!!!"
2,IDENTICAL TO THE HERBAL DOG CARE BOOK,I bought both the Herbal Cat Book as well as the Herbal Dog Book and they are almost page-for-page identical! The only change is one says dog and the other says cat. Not happy with this at all.
2,Not for well versed herbalists,"I consider myself an amateur when it comes to herb use, but have been studying and using herbs in my life for a few years now. I hoped for concrete advice regarding parasites and some other health concerns and felt this book was lacking. For someone new to herbs it offers guidance that is beneficial but I found myself frustrated that it was repeating very basic information that I know (ginger for digestion, dandelion good tonic, echinacea for immune system) and not getting into the more specific information I would like in a health reference for my cats. It also does not go into what herbs are toxic to cats, another thing that I feel is vitally important to have in any book on herbal cat care. If you are new to herbs and want to start learning, this is an easy to read book, but if you have any specific concerns or want more in depth information this is not the book for you."
3,3 & 1/2 for Open,"Well, Open certainly isn't Steve's worst stuff. And of course it's great to have ""Talking to the Sun,"" ""1988 Aktivatior,"" ""New Age Synthesis"" and ""Healing Feeling"" on CD. These are unquestionably the best tracks on the disc: groovin' psychedelic spaced out jams for neo-electrick gypsies. Of the other material, ""Earthrise"" is a killer middle-eastern influenced instrumental that reminds one instantly of ""The Glorious Om Riff."" ""Definite Activity"" and ""Don't Dither Do It"" are also pretty bouncy, as well as rocking pretty good. So, three and half stars for this one seems appropriate."
5,Open and play this cd,"The Virgin reissue offers a monster sound, nice jewel case, two unreleased tracks and lengthy story line booklet with fresh photos from the band. The sound here retains SH's hallmark space rock guitars and celestial synthesizers of long time collaborator Mirquette Giraudy. Some tracks carry a funk groove that would put a mischievous grin on your face. Another good offering at par with ""Motivation Radio"" or ""Green"". So ""Open"" ready your strobe lights, add dry ice and your ready to go outer space."
3,good progressive music,thois is a typical sound of progressive music of '70 years. Hillage is a good guitar man.
4,Garish B-Fun,"Second in series entry has great/fun with second banana teen slasher providing support for our lead's (perpetual) revenge. As Chris D points out in the commentary (always very low key but welcomed and insightful) these Legends films are stock plots made viable by fairly astute directing. This color offering, ""Quick Draw,"" is a good place to start. It has all the cliches of the genre, yet it's still very watchable."
3,Should definitely have been the last one in the series!,"This second offering in the Okatsu series is ok, but only just. It is by no means made as cheaply as some of the other revenge movies of the time, the costumes are good and the cinematography not bad. The story is slow, really slow, and it becomes more and more boring after the death under torture of her father.Junko Miyazono is a very attractive woman, but her swordplay is just lame, and I mean really poor. If you have to watch this one, take my word: There is definitely no need to sit through the third part of the series, which is pretty awful."
4,Works well and smells great!,"The only reason I purchased this product initially is because it was my only option for a natural shower spray from Amazon. I thought the cost was bit high, though. Well, I must admit, I've just purchased my second case. The product works well (just start with a clean shower) and smells very nice - a light, pleasant scent. If the cost were lower it would have my 5 stars."
2,A Lackluster Effort at Best!,"Of course we all know the computers players can do things that your players cannot, but damn. The computer throws balls through your defenders, receivers and scat-back will break 6-7 tackles on the way to the endzone and your receivers with 99 speed will be run down by the computers linebacker with speed rated at 84. Corners randomly run away from receivers leaving them wide open for long touchdown passes.......consistently. You can have a receiver double-teamed and they will both just run away from the reciever. Litterally...that is not an exaggeration. No play action or nothing...........just run towards the line of scrimmage. It has to be some kind of glitch in the game. If all that was already said was not bad enough, it freezes up in the second half of the spring game..........consistently. I exchanged a copy for another copy that does the exact same thing. EA dropped the ball on this one!!!!"
3,You know what you're getting,"Another small iteration over a game you played in 2001. EA is resting on their laurels. Is it a good game? Yes, I suppose so, but compared to other genres, NCAA and Madden are dragging their heels. I suppose it has to do with exclusivity deals that EA struck with the NFL, and since that technology undoubtedly trickles down to the NCAA game, you get mediocrity all around.A little competition would help."
2,Bush on cover explanation,"John, the reason bush is on the cover is because it's against NCAA regs to use a college player's likeness to make money. Therefore they have to use kids that are no longer playing college ball. That's also why there are no names for any of the players in the game.It's one of the many insanely stupid rules the NCAA has come up with, but there it is."
1,????????,This is what happens when Companies have no competitionThey can make mockery's of a game like this this is even worse than MaddenI didnt think it could get worse than maddenWho likes college football you dont get player names only numbers who wants to play a game without player namesHEY MESSAGE TO EA SPORTS STOP FREKIN MAKING STUPID FOOSEBALL GAMES AND START MAKING THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME AGAINMVP BASEBALL
3,NFL or college ??,"Why does it show Reggie Bush on the cover in a USC uniform, if Reggie signed with the Saints in the NFL in summer 2006 ? Am I missing something here ?In other words, I would expect the pro version to show Bush, who is now a PRO. The college version might show a COLLEGE athlete."
3,"Worth Seeing, But Not Allen's Best","I rented this movie and reference it a lot. Mostly just the beginning part where Allen makes awful jokes like, ""Have you heard about the King's new exercise program? It's called taxing the peasants."" So the movie starts out pretty good.Still, the movie isn't jam packed with laughs like Bananas is. It moves a little bit slower than some of Allen's other funny films. It takes its time. Every now and then a big laugh happens, but the laughs are a bit spaced out sometimes.Gene Wilder is in this movie. I like Gene Wilder. I think in this movie he delivers two big laughs.John Carradine is in this movie too. Very interesting to see this guy set up opportunities for Woody Allen to deliver punchlines and wisecracks. Even after Carradine mentions the most twisted sexual experiments ever that he's been conducting, all Allen can say is, ""I hear you're famous for your potato pancakes."""
4,"Long title, short movie...","Woody Allen stars in several short spoofs of the sex game...starting back in the middle ages and working up to the (then, 1972) present...funny parts, but not one of his best."
1,Awful,"not at all funny, sound quality terrible, it's a waste of time and money, gross, and hi def quality terrible,"
2,"Advertising of this DVD was confusing, product not what expected.","I ordered this for a friend's birthday, but there was some mix-up because it was not the English language versionof the famous Woody Allen movie as expected, but something from Eastern Europe. I don't know the details,if this was an authorized translation, or a bootleg. very confusing.So my friend had to mail it back to Amazon, and eventually my acct was credited."
3,"Love Woody, but its a bit dated...","Not his best. A few good laughs. Its better as a study of an early Woody, and realizing what his work emerged from, than a movie that stands on its own."
3,not as I remembered,"I had memories of a big inflatable breast floating in a field and it always made me smile. Wanted to see it again, but my memory was better than the real thing. I guess 40 years does that to your brain. For me, it was better the first time around."
2,Typical dry and senseless Woody allen humor!,"This is a film that will leave a lasting impression on the viewer, but not because of it's clever writing, content and filming. It will be because of some of the most low based and stupid humor on film. There are some funny moments, but they are so few that you wonder why you even spent time watching it. This film does not show the best of Woody Allen, in fact, almost just the opposite."
1,Get your hands out of your pockets.,"It's obscene to think you thought about reaching for your wallet to purchase this dvd.This movie was very boring with its juvenile sex humor. The director didn't even want to be named and the obviously made-up ""Woody"" Allen is given credit.""Woody"". Ha! Ha! That's rich."
4,Some very funny stuff here!,"The price of the movie is worth it just for the Gene Wilder scene! And What's My Perversion, too! It's perhaps a little uneven, but it has some very funny stuff in it. Good early Allen, with great performances."
5,"CEREBRAL HUMOR, EVEN AFTER 20 YEARS!","This movie had me rolling on the floor, it remains an outrageous piece of comedy even in the year 2000. It is cerebral and irreverent.Just think about ""crossdreesing"" - it still raises a few eyebrows in the year 2000. Imagine what it may have been like in the 70's. This film and its satires and parodies may have helped to bring out a thing or two ""out of the closet.""I am a Gene Wilder fan and the story about him and the sheep is just too hysterical. As is the story about the spermatozoa.Get a couple of your brainy friends to come over some night and watch it over beers and pizza. It is great fun."
1,Wrong Format,"I am so disappointed.....put the dvd into player and learned this copy was for German products....not our USA machines. Returned the dvd, as no other choice was offered. I'd hoped to have the problem corrected. Still haven't seen the movie!"
3,"Somewhat helpful, VERY out-of-date","Although the descriptions of different babies' development & temperment were somewhat interesting, this book is completely out-of-date. The photos and some of the advice was so old-fashioned (i.e. letting babies sleep on their stomachs, feeding healthy babies ""sugar water"" to delay feedings) that it was distracting. This book needs a major overhaul to make it worth the $17 pricetag. I returned it."
1,Outdated in the extreme.,"Full of outdated advice such as putting baby to sleep on his stomach, scheduling feedings and leaving a newborn to ""cry it out."" Also focuses on the worst experiences of new mothers. It's important for struggling new mothers to know that they are not alone in their doubts, fears and resentments, but I found it very disheartening to read about these mothers (and fathers) who fantasize about escaping the demands of motherhood by ""accidentally"" dropping or drowning the baby and who resent, dislike and ignore (that is, neglect) their newborns. I recommend either The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two / by William and Martha Sears or Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5 / by American Academy Of Pediatrics instead."
5,Still a great read...,I read this 31 years ago when my daughter was an infant. Now I'm reading it again as I'm a new grandma!
5,Love this lampshade,"This lampshade is adorable. I love the stitching, and I think the base is great also."
4,Treatise on Internet Marketing,"This book offers a blow-by-blow account of a successful internet campaign. Allen is applying the same principles he used to demonstrate Nothing Down real estate purchasing now to internet marketing. Its very detailed and very educational. The bad reviews are basically naysayers who want a million dollars on a silver platter. Unfortunately, you have to take risks and go to work."
2,Paying for Advertisements,"This book has some good ideas on how to make money on the internet, but the ways to go about them are hidden behind advertisements for the guest writers in the book. If everyone who reads this book went to the website of Robert Allen and the guest writers, they would make a fortune off of the internet.There are better books out there that can help you out with making money. Robert Allen is a great motivator and can get you pumped up, but this book is nothing but a series of advertisements for himeself and his friends. Save your money."
2,Good reading....but you won't make 24 grand in 24 hours.,"I always enjoy reading motivational books. They fuel you up, give you a couple of good analogies, but keep realistic! It is totally true what other reviewers are saying: HE DID 110 and something thousand dollars in 24 hours - oh, yes, BUT HE IS A WELL KNOWN author, prepared the whole show over several weeks, had 11,000 people listed as subscribers to his other stuff...well, MOST OF US DON'T! Also i think about one of my email boxes that i use on sites like Mr. Allens Site, just to get free stuff, and than have them forward all kinds of messages to me, that i never read. So, would he count me as one of 11,000 ""faithful"" subscribers? I get the feeling that nowadays this is called SPAM! Because you don't have a warm, personal relationship with 11,000 people...most of them will call this: spamming. Which we all had enough of."
5,If you just believe......,"I was more than skeptical about this book until I read the first chapter. I became excited about the possibility of being able to create multiple streams of Internet income. I had plans to launch a website but wasn't sure exactly how to get started. In this book,Bob Allen takes me by the hand and show me exactly what I need to do to launch a website, develop a feeding frenzy on my website, drive traffic to my website and more. The book doesn't promise me that I'll get rich overnight, but it does give me the tools necessary to create a stream of income using the Internet. Bravo to Bob!"
3,Look at the Source,"People who have attended the seminars with a closed mind and have accomplished little? Or people who have attended his seminars and/or read his books and have accomplished a lot. I give this book a 3 stars because it leaves out a lot of information. I have started 3 dot-coms, my 3rd one finally being successful. I would still highly recommend this book to anyone because he provides some very useful URLs and it saves you a lot of time of having to search the net for hours or days to find the free information. Mr. Allen is a multi-millionaire many times over, he only does the seminars to help people, not to make money. Anyone else who says otherwise just doesn't know the man. There are doers and there are naysayers, which one are you? I still recommend this book because there are concepts you can use immediately."
3,The Marketeer,"Robert Allen is a brilliant ""marketeer"" i.e. he has found brilliant ways of making money off seminars and book sales. He did this by following trends: The first one was the Cult of Nothing Down in the 80s, then came a wacky vitamin MLM and now there is The First Church of Multiple Streams of Income. It involves ""connecting with the universe"" etc. Oh, and don't forget to buy this book as well as attend a seminar. Like I said the man is a great ""marketeer""."
5,I tried it and it worked!,"I must admit I was skeptical, but I tried his tips on affiliate programs,(chapter 11) and this week my sales on my site jumped 45%! So, yes.....I'm glad I bought this book!"
3,A Good Read,"Mr. Allen's book has a lot of good information. But I can't say it is the best book on the subject. But the information about marketing your web business is practical. If you are a novice, you will learn useful information that can help you increase your business. I was surprised it didn't contain anything about adding audio or video to help increase your sales. But I did find a source that contains samples of these products at www.insider-sources.com under the link: www.insider-sources.com/EvenMore.htm."
5,Marketing information of value,Multiple Streams of Internet Income has some value as a starting point for people that would like to find the Internet as a way to do business and earn a living. But there is not much new in the book that can't be easily found online.
5,Classic Marketing Principles Applied to the Internet,"The gaping stupidity of all the ""dot-bombs"" in the last few years is that other reasonably intelligent people listened to a bunch of geek heads in horn-rimmed glasses for marketing advice. Duh! What were they thinking? What Allen does brilliantly is market and his book is not about a bunch of techno-gizmos that don't translate to the bottom line. MSoII is about ""Show Me the Money"" and ""Getting to 'Yes!'"" all in one easy-to-read volume that will give you a clue of what you REALLY need to do on the Internet if you want an ebusiness instead of just a website. Is Allen a self-promoter? Absolutely. Does he then show people exactly how to do it themselves? You bet. I have more respect for that level of honesty and someone who's withstood a few knocks over the years compared to some snotty-nosed 20-something brat who's never seen a downturn in the economy since he's been old enough to drive. Allen has been there and back and I respect his opinion."
3,Little More than a How to Get Author Rich Scheme,"While Allen does have a track record, and this is not quite a Get Rich Quick scheme, this book is more about Allen making people buy his book than providing solid ideas about how to financially help them. While he does provide some good ideas and strategies, so too do several others, like Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired.I'm not saying a person can't find some good ideas in this book. And there are people who continually fall for the Get Rich Quick schemes that proliferate out there like mosquitoes.But, if you're looking for a book that's chock-full of solid and fundamentally sound strategies about making money off of Internet users, this may not be your best bet."
1,"I would never buy this, or any other book by Allen because..","I receive so much spam from Allen, or from people hawking his ""get rich quick"" schemes, that buying anything written by this guy, even if he is a ""genius"", would only reward bad behaviour thus making me party to the scourge of spam. Since I have no desire to be part of the problem, I choose to be part of the solution by not buying any products or services from those who spam, even if the products or services would otherwise be interesting, not to suggest that Allen's is.""Multiple Streams of Internet Income: How Ordinary People Make Extraordinary Money Online"" - in a word, spam! If Allen was such a maven of marketing, he would not have to alienate huge swaths of the population to achieve his goals."
4,Just take one nugget from this book and you will be on your way to internet success!,"We read this book once a quarter at Insightbridge.com, it is mandatory. The best thing is when we finish - we always find some takeaway that we can apply to our online business. We have been doing this for 3 years now and will continue until we read it and no more new marketing ideas come forth...Pick it up read it and re-read it - good luck."
2,Unrealistic And Unoriginal,"If you haven't read anything on e-commerce at all, or if you're a total newbie, the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business. For someone who is already in the business or has already done some research, this book merely repeats a lot of well-known tips. Even then, some of the tips, like in section on affiliate programs, are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic.As for the first part of the book where Allen demonstrates how he could earn $24k in one day, I find it totally unrealistic and it certainly won't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has Robert Allen's background to begin with. Even then, this sort of strategy won't cut it with today's wise and cynical netizens anymore."
5,Visual Genius!!,"Love this film! It's stunning, gritty, beautifully filmed. Although this film has been compared to Coppola's works, I'm more inclined to think of Lynch with a hint of Tarantino. Brilliant, absolutely Brilliant!"
1,outdated and cheesy,"I love to practice yoga and thought that this would inspire me to take it a step further and enhance my spiritual practice, however, I could not get into it because it is just sooo cheesy! It is done in a low budget set in what it seems like a living room, along with the instructors quacky ensemble along with a group of students ranging in age which would seem OK, except for the vocal point being on this older woman during the whole practice. It was just wrong on all levels and if perhaps it didn't have the gimmicky outfit and bad music, it could actually be put in use. Too bad, I was looking forward to it...I guess I will stick to my Yoga on the Edge with Sara Ivanhoe..."
2,Not very durable,"I received this as a gift, and I've only had it for 6 months. Unfortunately the strap that holds down the flap has come lose and is fraying,and just the other day the top of the bag where the handle attaches to the seam has torn open.Other than that I did love the bag."
1,Not a good splitter,"This item is billed as a tablet splitter/crusher. It may do a good job of crushing pills, I don't know because I didn't try that. However, as a splitter it is a failure. There is no way to center the tablet, so you can not split it into equal pieces. The blade is too short and doesn't reach the entire cutting area, so you may miss the tablet you are trying to split. In addition, it doesn't cut cleanly, so you have lots of lost powder and ""shards"". If you are after a splitter, get a real one."
2,"Crumbles, doesn't split","This pill splitter doesn't split. It'll make the pills crumble, making it difficult to decide how much of the pill dust you should take.The crusher works, of course. And there is a little compartment to carry a pill or two in.I'd recommend the pill cutter at epill.com."
5,still lovely,"Not quite as good as The Innkeeper's Song -- read that first, if you haven't yet -- but still a delightful return to that world."
4,"good stuff, but flawed","As usual, Mr. Beagle proves what a master he is at world-creation and character-generation (and his prose is lovely, as usual). Also as usual, the resolutions of the story just never merit their fabulous build-up. (The last three stories are somewhat better in this department than the first three--esp. ""Giant Bones"" and ""Choushi-Wai's Story"", tho' you'd expect more spice from any story with Lal and Soukyan in it, even if they are in their 80s, right?) The most glaring example of this was the third story, ""The Tragical Historie of the Jiril's Players""--which was really, really good (pretty funny, too)...until the ending! I mean, the build-up is great, but you're so amused and interested in the Players, you kinda wish they'd play a larger role in the outcome! Oh, well. Anyway, despite all this (and they do get better as they go along), it's rare I've read a collection of worth-while fantasy short stories...but this is a good one!"
3,I plan to keep it in my collection and listen to it over and over,"This book is NOT your, ""The Last Unicorn"" which was in every way a children's book. Instead ""Giant Bones"" has more of the gritty reality of life, vernacular language, swear words, body functions and so on. This magical adventure takes us to world apart from our daily lives where any thing can happen. This is not my favorite Peter S. Beagle book but I do plan to keep it in my collection and listen to it over and over. Your Sincerely, Lost And Confused"
3,Just for fun,"Our family received this book as a gift. Each one of my children enjoyed read the book like a novel. Who would think of a cookbook as kid-friendly reading material? They liked the pictures and stories interspersed within the recipes. Many of the tips presented are the kind a grandma might teach a younger child. Tips like how to get young children safely involved in the kitchen including how to teach using a knife safely. In a world where people have vastly forgotten the meaning of family, books like this fill the gap. The traditions presented are mostly Rabbinic. The items shown on the cover are included in the book."
3,Sub-Par,"Stiff - The orchestra seemed ever-so-slightly off-beat occasionally. The photography was choppy. I was surprised, expecting more from a great orchestra and a great conductor. Maybe it's me. I've been known to be wrong."
3,It's not the A & E Mytsteries of the bible,It's not the A & E Series Mytsteries of the bible. If you are looking for the A & E series do not buy this set.
3,"Misleading ""Mysteries""",This NOT the series that was broadcast on TV with Richard Kiley and Jean Simmons. The description content is mis-leading and should be deleted. I wish I had read all of the reviews before purchasing.
5,Great Show - Release This Season Now!!,Please release Season Two! We have been waiting and waiting and waiting! I am getting so frustrated at this point. I am not sure why HBO is waiting so long to release this. People are going to lose interest in the show if it isn't released soon. Doesn't make good marketing sense :(
5,ABOUT TIME!,"Finally! The date is set for June 8th. I cannot believe they took 2 years to do it.This is the most intriguing show I've ever seen. I got addicted to it from the beginning and have not been able to stop. Amazing writing, interesting stories, brilliant acting... What more can you ask for. Characters are actually multidimensional and interesting to watch. I cannot wait to buy this set.Let's hope third season will not take another 2 years to come out."
5,Great Show,"This is a great show. Well written, well acted and funny in that dark and subtle kind of way. I wish all the episodes had commentary, but 5 of 13 will have to do.Also, in response to a review posted earlier, the reason the West Wing is in widescreen format is because starting with the second season, the show itself was filmed in widescreen. I assume that Siz Feet Under is filmed in regular Full Frame. Even though I agree that widescreen is superior, you just can't change full frame to widescreen."
5,Give it to us!,"I'm sooooo disappointed at not being able to see Six Feet Under -The Second Season. I just discovered the first season, and am chomping at the bit to catch up with The Fishers. Get this out on DVD NOW!!! What a truly wonderful series this is. Please don't withhold it from non-HBO subscribers any longer!"
3,Enh,This season was a lot less exciting than the first season in part because there iSight less sex and violence. It focuses more on the characters personal lives with school and inner demons.
2,Missed some part,I think they deleted some port of the show .Is not completed .I'm sure !!! So that's is the 2 starts for
4,Great Product,This was exactly what I wanted. Great product for those with on off and dark sense of humor. Highly recommended
3,A good follow up season full of drama/laughs and more drama,I never wtaced six feet under when it was origianlly on the air. I enjoyed this season it had more drama then the first and more of a story then the first. The acting is top notch and the story's are great. The season final was alos very good and it leaves you on the edge of your seat. The series is not the greatest at times the stories drag on and on and on.
2,not as good as I remembered. . .,"I recently watched this series. I remembered really liking it and looking forward to Sundays on HBO and couldn't wait for a DVD release. I was so disappointed. I found it to be so depressing I had to force myself to get through it. So long, Fishers."
4,Best deal going for Six Feet Under (3),"I purchased through the Amazon.ca website -and took a chance on selecting a vendor with a $10 lower price -Princess22222 .I'd never done this before, but I took a chance, and received my new unopened DVD set complete and in good shape - and about 12% less than Amazon's already great price. I'd do it again.I""m only 3 episodes into the season -but it looks as good as the previous."
2,This series has outlasted its interest,"I liked the first season, but the second season has worn out my interest. Too heavy, far-fetched, and filled with gratuitous emotionality, like a cheap soap opera. Grotesque may be fun for a film, not for a long series."
4,Nearly a 5-Star Outing if Not For . . .,"The obnoxiously insulting blue balls the audience is left to endure from the season's ""conclusion""--but my god, was the foreplay ever fun. Even with the knowledge of what fate awaited my balls, I still would have pursued the experience--the series is just that damn good but I do recommend you pack some ice along for the ride."
5,Just can't wait any longer!,"I'm from Poland, and I fell in love with this series, I'm now waiting for the third season on HBO Poland. My life is like ""Six feet under"", they could use me and my family, as the inspiration.I love everyone who is a fan of this series. I got a friend wich leads life as Brenda in the second series. We both love Ruth.www.HBO.pl"
5,Incredibly Amazing,"Honestly I have never been so impressed with a story line that makes me crave it. I was introduced to Six Feet Under by my boyfriend, and just by telling me about the first episode I was already in awe....I would love it if everyone could take the time, and really enjoy this I know I have. It is very hard for me to choose a favorite character, everyone has such an neat personality that they portray, I am foaming at the mouth with excitement for the second season to come, I know I will be one of the many waiting impatiently in line. Thank-you"
1,I love the show but.....,"When I received my new, shrink wrapped discs they all had finger prints (not sure how that happens on ""new"" items ) and scratches. The fifth disc is also so badly scratched. Not very happy with the item received."
5,mariposa county,My second buying of the book. Excellent pictures (including my family pictures that we have never seen).
3,For a smaller cuisinart!,"I ordered this assuming (I know, one should never assume!) that it was for a standard sized Cuisinart (7 - 11 cup). It's for a much smaller Cuisinart and won't fit those larger machines.Also, the picture shows an entirely metal blade. The one that arrived to me is mostly plastic with a metal blade mounted on it, fyi."
4,read it twice!,"This book is loaded with alot of ancient ways to summon demonsand devils. I found it hard to understand until I read it a couple of times before it sank in. I dont summon demons because its to risky and I dont want a poltergeist in my home, but for someone brave enough, I say go for it. I highly recommened this book for the one who dare uses it."
1,Mouse click problem,"I am very disapointed with this product.The mouse reacts on every 3rd click.I am not alone who has this problem, so the only thing i can recommend to new customers: DONT BUY IT!It is almost unusable, and after problems with Creative SB Audigy, i am really not interested in any Creative product in the future."
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. I didn't realize when I got it that it dealt only with the very old, pre 1950's stuff. Things I didn't play with as a kid, nor want to get to collect. I am sure there is an audience for this book, but I am not one of them."
1,Huh? What? What time is it?,"Oh, sorry... fell asleep again. That seems to happen every time I put this on. You know how everyone describes a CD by saying ""this sounds like X crossed with Y?"" Well, watch the 11:10PM weather forecast on a really small market local newscast (preferably where it snows a lot), then filter in a really boring AA meeting, and you'll have ""A Ghost Is Born.""In many Wilco reviews, there are phrases like ""takes a while to sink in"" or ""takes repeated listenings."" That is what people say when they really mean ""this sucks, but I'm going to force myself to like it, since everyone else does."""
3,Why every review written so far is crap...,"Some people are saying that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Others are disappointed because it didn't match up with YHF. Well, for the former, you're probably just saying that because it's Wilco, and if they put out an album filled with 2 hours of white noise, you'd probably bow down and worship it. And for the latter, nothing Wilco ever does will be as good as YHF, and you just have to face it.If YHF never came out, I'd give this album 5 stars. But sadly, I can never give another Wilco album 5 stars, because that would be equating it with YHF.Oh, and also for the latter, try putting out a cd of this caliber, wannabe sell-out idiots, and then you can say something bad about this album. Oh, what is this silence I hear? That's what I thought."
2,A Turd Is Born,"Yeah, this is the worst thing Tweedys ever done. And he's now successfully fullfilling the ""tortured artist"" role with his rehab stint. Meanwhile he's released this dud."
1,What the?????,"I was a big fan of Wilco's until ""Yankee Foxtrot Hotel blah blah blah..""whatever. After reading the first couple of reviews of this album in some major magazines it sounded like Jeff Tweedy was getting back to some serious songwriting with hooks and a melody. Not true. This album again shows a great band getting worse on every level. I have listen to this album a dozen times, because that's what they say, ""repeat listening and it will suck you in"". Well it sucked me in and spat me back out disapointed. Now I'm stuck with another $14.99 c.d. that if I return for store credit I only get something like $9.99. Thanks jeff I will never ever buy one of your c.d.s again. I had a religious experience when I saw Wilco in L.A. on the Being There tour. I can't belive I have lost faith in what was once a great band. To find great hooks and melody check out any Sondre Lerche album"
1,Really bad,This album kept coming up as a recommendation on Amazon so I bought it. I can't believe how truly unlistenable this is. There is actually a song that goes on forever that is nothing but noise. I tried to get to like this by listeneing to it over and over like the main reviewer recommended but it is too bad to listen to that many times. Its not just me the wife hates it too.
4,A Ghost is Born,Great music. You will have to listen to this CD a few times to get it. Better than YHF. If you are a talk radio listener forget it. You are a loser and won't have time. Would be a five if not for static on Less Than You Think. Give it a chance and you will be rewarded.
3,I hope it grows on me,"I've struggled with this album so far - it feels like it wants to be both YHF while working to distinguish itself in some way - consequently, it seems to have little of its own personality. Perhaps it'll grow on me..."
2,Why do my fav bands end up sounding like the beatles,"Ok,This is crap!I don't like the 10 minute song of feedbackThe only track I do like is the one that sounds like a beatles rip-off. The 3 or 4 track.C'mon.... where are the beautiful songs?"
4,refreshingly different,"everybody's right. this is no Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but wilco again outdoes themsleves with this record. standout tracks: muzzle of bees, company on my back, i'm a wheel, spiders (kidsmoke).now if only they'd make up their Toronto gig that was cancelled cause of the whole Lollapalooza fiasco."
3,"Not Great, but Good","I'll have to say that a lot of this album grabbed me at first listen. ""Muzzle of Bees"", ""Hummingbird"" and ""The Late Greats"" are all easily accessible, and ""Company In My Back"", wow! When that dulcimer comes in after the chorus, it just puts the song over the top. Other songs like ""At Least That's What You Said"" and ""Hell Is Chrome"" take some getting used to. ""Less Than You Think"" should have been less on the clock and after awhile ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" gets a little annoying.The lyrics to this set of songs are not Tweedy's best, in fact some of them are borderline stupid. Musically, I give this album a thumbs up. The arrangements are great, but Tweedy needed a lyricist for this one."
2,"Slow, Tough Listen","I love Wilco and their music. I think they're innovative and very talented, however, A Ghost is Born doesn't reflect that so much. This album is quite slow making it a rough to listen to. There are great songs on this CD, don't get me wrong, but overall, I beleive it to be their least best effort. Give me Being There or YHF anyday.PS - Keep your hand on the volume on your stereo because of the inconsistent levels."
2,Drifting a little too far into the esoteric,"After the challenging but successful YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT, Wilco pushes even harder on the experimentation with A GHOST IS BORN; this time the experiment is not as successful. Many songs suffer from a commitment to jarring feed beck and sonic shifts that do nothing but interrupt the melody, and lyrics that are often impenetrable in their obtuseness. Lines like, ""chambers of chains with red plastic mouths"" and ""I attack with love, pure bug beauty, curl my lips and crawl up to you,"" are left to the listener to perceive as pearls of wisdom rather than just bizarre images. Songs shift from gentle to strident without reason, other than the whim of the band. It often reminds me of Robyn Hitchcock's work, without the saving grace of humor and whimsy. I guess this was a natural extension of YHF's sensibilities, but it proves to be a fruitless one."
5,Wow. wilco has been reborn,"A mere ghost of what they once were (the only remaining members from their first cd are john stiratt and jeff tweedy), wilco has, against all of my expectations put out an album that rivals yankee hotel foxtrot, which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums ever.Filled with allegories for drug use, tweedy's lyrics explor things that other songwrtiters leave untouchted. His oft amusical guitar solos push the boundries of what music is. Wilco has always been reinventing rock music while at the same time drawing from the greatws :talking heads, beatles, etc. Wilco is one of the few truly indipendent bands still left in the world. A must have."
3,Less Than You Think,"I really want to like this album. I keep listening to it in the hope that something will click and I'll suddenly get it, but I haven't yet. None of the songs are are head catchingly great as some older Tweedy songs (Wait Up, Outtamind (Outtasite), and I'm Trying to Break Your Heart come immediately to mind), and the spare sound of the album leaves far too many holes to sound complete. The improv elements of ""At Least That's What You Said"" and ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" are pretty cool and I'd like to see the band do a little more of that, but I still don't get the 10 minutes of feedback tones. I usually love avant-garde music. Wilco remains a band worth keeping track of, and I'll pick up their next release, but ""A Ghost Is Born"" leaves me with the same deflated feeling that the last two Spiritualized albums caused."
3,Decent but disappointing,"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was a magical album of truly consistent songwriting and incredible arrangements that played with the boundaries of pop music, so following it up was always going to be difficult. A Ghost Is Born feels more back-to-basics, less complex, less experimental, and is worse for it. There are pretty, upbeat strums like 'Hummingbird', beautiful ballads like 'Wishful Thinking' and some rockier tones on tracks like 'Spiders' too. However generally these are just piano-led pop/rock tunes, pleasent but not approaching the leftfield daring of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (or, for that matter, the sprawling intrigue of 'Being There'. Furthermore, a number of tracks are just quite boring. It just doesn't have the same emotional impact. Not bad, but disappointing."
3,"Boo! (or, rather, Boo.)","A handful of these tunes (""Hummingbird"", ""Company in My Back"", ""Wishful Thinking"", ""Muzzle of Bees"") capture a wistful, otherwordly vibe that the title suggests, but too many (""Spiders [Kidsmoke]"", ""Less than You Think"", ""Handshake Drugs"") are just trendy neighborhood kids with sheets over their heads."
5,They do it again (minus Bennett),"Once again, Wilco has managed to put out another great album. In addition to the amazing song-writing skills of Jeff Tweedy, the band has also developed a new sort of sound. They've expanded more, anyway. They've lost the layered and and weird sounds from YHF because of losing Jay Bennett, but that doesn't take away from this record one bit. I see this record and YHF as two things that are completely different, but they're best friends anyway. Go buy this. Now."
2,"Ok, Tweedy lost me here...","My only thoughts on this album are as follows:1.) When did Jeff Tweedy turn into Damon Gough? I miss the rasp.2.) COME BACK JAY BENNETT!!!! Wthout Jay to temper Jeff's musical ramblings, the album comes off sounding less like the typical Wilco magic, and more like Tweedy's bedroom 4-track solo project. With Damon Gough singing. ahem.3.) The guitar work is gorgeous- at times, that is. Hearing Jeff shred it up Neil Young style in ""Hell is Chrome"" is truly a transcendent, beautiful moment. Doesn't make up for the rest of the tune (which, I might add, was better when Counting Crows did it- it was called ""Long December""...), and in the end, sitting throught a whole tune for 12-20 seconds of guitar genius just gets stale.4.) ""1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9!"" .....Ummm... did I hear that right? Don't expect any lyrical genius here. Apparently, the sort of ethereal lyrical beauty of ""Via Chicago"" and ""Ashes..."" is a thing of the past.I want my Wilco back."
3,"Big Fan, but...","Being a huge Wilco fan, I ran out and purchased this album the first day it was available and - I hate saying it - I am disappointed. Wilco has always left me standing alone - trying to explain to others why this is the greatest band in modern times. I have learned to just give up trying to convince others and just enjoy the music, but this time I am joining the crowd. This album's songs are too repetitive within themselves (see ""Spiders"") or just to boring. I will give it many listens as I realize great albums always take a while to grow on one, but I just don't see it happening with ""A Ghost is Born""."
1,VERY Disapointing,"Sorry, this sounds like unfinished demo tapes.The songs work much better on Kicking Television."
2,soon to be heard in elevators around the world,I love Tweedy but this is just weak. It doesnt do anything for me but sound like background music.
1,What went wrong?,"As I sit here with A.M. in my PC's CD player, I have to think, what went wrong? It is obvious that Tweedy and his cohorts are musically and lyrically talented, but for some reason seem to think that making noise is more expressive than writing a song that might actually be coherent and have a point. IMHO A.M. is twice the record that YHFT or Ghost could even hope to be. For those of you that say that a band like Wilco cannot stay static and must progess musically, I offer the example of the Jayhawks for a band that can remain true to its genre while experimenting with new and different sounds. (For example, listen to Tomorrow the Green Grass and then Sound of Lies--completely different sounds, same genre, all incredible music). I guess Wilco is catering to the critics, but to that I say: critics don't buy records--consumers do.I couldn't reccomend this album any less. I wish I could get my $14 back."
5,A bold new direction ...,"There's a kind of light blue flame that burns beneath most of this album, a persistent hum that you can't hear right off. But once you dial in, it elevates the entire album. Wilco has struck out for a lonely new frontier on this album, it's a sound that's isolated and breathless, like someone who runs away from the pack out into the woods on a dark, misty night, turns around and sees no one has followed, and suddenly you can hear the night sounds, the sounds of silence and eerie noises. I agree with the other reviewers who were fortunate to see Wilco live on their recent tour. I saw them in San Jose just before departing for Europe last fall. Songs like Least That's What You Said and Company In My Back really shine live, and just add to your appreciation of a great album. By the way, I like Tweedy's guitar solos, they have a more distilled, emotionally direct style than Jay Bennett."
3,Enough with the Neil Young guitar solos,"I think I fall into the camp that hasn't listened to this enough. Maybe it will grow on me and it's quite possible that I just don't 'get it' yet. Having said that, Jeff Tweedy, as incredible as he is, needs to step away from the guitar. I never listen to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot unless I have the time to listen to it from start to finish and revel in the true genius that went into it. Now, I know it's unfair to hold A Ghost is Born to the same standard, but I can't shake the idea that Jay Bennett is greatly missed. Jeff, please, enough with the guitar solos. That is the pure reason why I can not listen to AGIB all the way through. As soon as he starts wanking on that guitar ala Neil Young, I have to skip to the next track. And that's a shame because there certainly are some beautiful moments on this recording. Again....maybe I just don't get it. Regardless....long live WILCO!!"
5,6 Stars,"Wilco surpasses my expectations every time I put one of their albums in. Wilco is addicting; I try to appreciate other music, but nothing seems to come close to Wilco. Anyone who is after great lyrics and good tunes; pick up Wilco"
4,stop the noise!!,I love this CD but the 'noise' at the end of some of the songs really takes so much away from the overall groove. I've recommended and have played a few of the tracks for friends and always mention--'the end of this track is a disaster and will grate on your nerves!' When I play the CD I always skip -to-the-next song when the distorted mess comes up. So much potential in the CD itself. Hopefully WILCO will become enlightened and lose the nails on chalkboard endings.
2,an egg is laid,"I have really tried to like this album. I played it in my car for a week, but just couldn't get over the self-indulgence of Tweedy and crew. If you like Wilco, you may want to borrow this album for a while & decide whether to buy it. If you are a new fan, start with Being There and skip this one. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from this otherwise great band"
3,Couldve been better,I'm a huge fan of Wilco and have been for sometime. But this album is much more laid back then others like yankee hotel. Kinda dissapointing but it puts me to sleep.
5,"Jeff Tweedy's mind--Terrible place to live,great to visit","This album was recorded on a smooth-sailed pot trip,and most fans know this...but what they don't realize is that this album has broken so many boundaries for music in general, right under our noses. By fusing and melding such taboo artforms as what's known as ""Greatful Rock"" after the pot loving 60's band The Greatful Dead and indie rock, Jeff Tweedy and company have made,quite possibly one of the top 5 albums of 2004 and i'm sure glad they did. The album is such a clever mix of soothing, pop hooks and stoned, jam sessions which blend perfectly in songs like Hummingbird, I'm a Wheel, and Spiders(Kidsmoke). This album is so refreshingly experimental that you just might be so entranced you may not remember what happend that day--just a warning. So, enjoy this drugged out album, for your own sake."
5,perfect,"Wilco have emerged with their best album to date with a ghost is born. Tweedy and company created an album that has more space and longer guitar solos, instead of the space blips and electronic drone of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. AGIB has more of a live feel to it and throwbacks to the 1970s type rock album format abound. There are great songs like Theologians and Hell is Chrome but really the whole record is a piece of art. Tweedy struggled with substance abuse during the recording of this album and the migraine induced Less than you think seems to sum that up quite well. The theme of self discovery seems to be laced throughout the recording and Wilco seem to finally found their niche. Goodbye twang and hello cherry ghost."
5,Jeff Tweedy delivers again.....,"Wilco has reinvented itself again. Just as there was pressure on Jeff Tweedy to produce the goods after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt's brilliant ""Trace,"" so there was pressure on Tweedy this time to show that he could make another great album, without Jay Bennett. He's done it, too--these are songs to be listened and savored over and over again. I'd have to listen to it another 100 times to decide whether I like it as much as ""Being There"" or ""Yankee Hotel,"" but I'm pretty confident I'm not going to get sick of this record before that 100th listening. It's a much different sound than the Wilco of 5 years ago, but not for the worse. How long Tweedy can rest content with the current lineup and the production of Jim O'Rourke is anyone's guess, but who cares--this is a terrific record."
4,A Great Step for Wilco,"This album presents a great step for Wilco. Released 2 years after 2002's wondrous Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, A Ghost is Born presents a sound change for Wilco. The sound on this album is likened to Neil Young and Crazy Horse in the guitar sound and stylings. The production is also similar to ""After the Goldrush"" - witness the piano sound on ""Hummingbird"". The production has a very analogue feel to it, which is great. This album successfully melds sounds of 70's rock, current Indie music, and a bit of country. One of the Best Albums of 2004."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"well well well. Being a big fan of Wilco I was excited when I purchased their new album A Ghost Is Born. And the result : not that happy. Don't get me wrong the songs,most of them,are still good songs but the production is not that great. Too Too quiet at times and at others , too lame. Like the 10+ minutes of crap that is the second to last song. If you're new to Wilco buy their album ""Summerteeth."" Thats their best. YHFT is good as well , really good but Summerteeth is a great album.Word"
3,"Very good, but madenly uneven...hence the 3 stars","The extended drone of the song ""Less than you think"" is soooo annoying that I rarely listen to this disc anymore...Yeah, yeah, there is a skip button, but I don't use it on great discs, as even the songs I am not crazy about tend to be ""growers""... Instead, Wilco, on ""Less than you think"" experiment in self indulgent crap that they appear to judge as ""progressive"" or ""meaningful""... I am as open to interesting extended instrumental experiments as most alternative music fans, BUT this was wayyyyyy over the top...I am afraid Wilco and Tweedy have lost their way... self-indulgence of this type is always a BIG NEON SIGN of that...Cheers.PS> Oh yeah, much of the rest of the CD IS VERY GOOD, if not quite up to Summerteeth or Yankee Foxtrot..."
2,Critically Oversold!,"The critical popularity of this disc is rather mystifying. Its inclusion on many of the ""best of"" lists of 2004 is even stranger. All in all it's just rather dull and badly executed. Tweedy sounds like he is trying to emulate the sort of guitar attack that Neil Young adopts with Crazy Horse, but his playing is underwhelming. He tries to make use of the volume, and the feedback, but it escapes him, and just sounds amateurish."
2,Yawn,"I found A Ghost is Born extremely boring by comparison to Wilco's two previous albums Summer Teeth (great album) and Yankee Fox Trot (good album). If you don't own either of those albums, buy them instead of this one. You won't be sorry."
2,Boooooring,"I'm mystified by the Cult of Wilco. Reading the Intelligent reviews of this Band's Art and Mythology only gives one the illusion that They are doing something Important and Poetic, something much more Incredible and Mature than anyone else who has ever lived, especially all the Dumb rock bands of the past. They apparently have Genius and Vision and don't have to worry about coming up with any good hooks, beautiful melodies, insightful lyrics, or much else--but nevertheless, this Album is probably Brilliant, according to seemingly everyone else. It has Shredding guitar solos(NOT by Nels Cline, in response to another reviewer), after all, and Funny Noises, just like YHF, so it's definitely a Masterpiece.I don't know why anyone wastes their time with this smug, mediocre band."
4,a ghost is born,"Great title. Great opener.My partner thinks its easy listening. I think its experimental. Leave it up to you to judge.Fav tracks 1,3,4. I dont know about the rest it sounds too forgettable. I ll have to lsiten to it again..."
3,what a moron,Last time I looked Pensecola FL was not a breeding ground for intellect.Just review the CD.You sound like an idiot. You probably work at the mall.
1,The sound of a band wanking its fans,"If you thought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was a mass of ridiculous, unlistenable, pretentious screeching and wanking, then check this baby out. And likewise, check out the legions of devoted and blinded ""fans"" genuflecting to the supposed ""genius"" of Jeff Tweedy in their reviews here. Personally, I think Amazon's reviews of Wilco albums are among the highest points of hilarity available on the web.For a band that shot its wad with ""Being There"" like ten years ago or something, this emperor's had less and less clothes each time I look. The clever lyrics are gone. Certain talented band members are gone. The super songwriting is gone. Even the covers are beginning to look similar in every way: bland, uninspired, and capital-P PRETENTIOUS. How artsy of them.I am so nauseated by this CD that I never want to hear it again, and anyone who wants to get my copy, feel free to email me before I trade it in for something interesting.A bad, bad band."
4,WARNING FOR INTELLECTS ONLY,IF YOUR A CASHIER AT WALMART THEN YOU BETTER PASS THIS HIGH PIECE OF ARTWORK BUY...IF YOUR A BURGER FLIPPER AT McDONALD'S MAY I SUGGEST BUYING THE LATEST BRITNEY SPEARS CD...IF YOUR AN INTELLECT THEN I SUGGEST BUYING THIS HIGH PIECE OF ART...MY ONLY BEEF ABOUT THIS CD IT'S NOT ACCESSIBLE ENOUGH...YANKEE HOTEL WAS VERY ACCESSIBLE...THIS CD DOES HAVE A THEME AND THE THEME ALL THE SONGS ARE RELATED TO THE ASPECT OF BEING DEAD OR GHOSTLIKE...IT'S REALLY HIGH ART BUT NOT ACCESSIBLE ENOUGH TO BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO...WILCO OR REALLY JEFF TWEEDY SINCE IT'S APPARENT IT'S NOT REALLY A BAND...ANYWAY IT SEEMS JEFF IS SUFFERING FROM A SLIGHT CASE OF SELF INDULGENCE...BUT US INTELLECTS WILL LOVE IT FOR THE REMINDER OF OUR LIVES UNTIL WE BECOME DEAD OR GHOSTLIKE!!!!
3,over indulgent and not for the uninitiated,"Though some of the tracks on this CD, most notably Spiders, Handshake Drugs and Company in My Back, will satisfy the hunger in Wilco fans for new songs to unsuccessfully try to get unstuck from playing repeat loops in their heads, Ghost falls flat as a complete album. It seems like we are being given a window into the song writing process rather than the finished product. After the simple elegence of their prior albums and the stunning luster and complexity of YHF, Tweedy seems to have wandered off for a guitar noodling session. After repeated listenings, I have grown to appreciate much of the subtlety hidden beneath the feedback-driven waves of frustration on this album, but it does in no way generate the 5-star 'I can't go another minute without hearing Ashes' reaction that YHF did after I had it for a couple of weeks. Frankly, this record is only for the experienced Wilco fan. Others will find much of it flailing and inaccessable."
3,Not great,"This album is definately a step below the rest of Wilco's catalog. It features a few excellent tunes (At least thats what you said, Handshake drugs, Late greats), a few good tunes (theologians, I'm a wheel, spiders), and several very mediocre songs. All together, the flow of the cd suffers from the inclusion of such uninspiring tunes, making for a disc with some great moments, and many moments to skip over. If you're new to Wilco, I would suggest starting with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot or Being There, both of which are solid all the way through."
4,If you want another YHF..thats your first problem.,"The first thing you notice about this new release from Wilco is the reviews . People either love it or they are disappointed. You will love Ghost if you appreciate the freshness of it, the very same freshness to approach and song creation that made YHF so unique for its time. You'll be disappointed if all you want is a rehash of YHF. But is that a very fair desire?Ghost has the same melodic beautifull moments of YHF but it also has more moments of sonic discordance. This CD makes you stop and think. It questions your expectations. and in doing so delivers something that is rich and unique.People shuffle out parts of CD's they don't enjoy all the time. In this case that's unfortunate if your so inclined after giving Ghost a listen. Its only after repeated listenings that the subtle aspects come forward. I can see someday that Wilco may just open a CD with a sound and it just continues from there.One big work or art."
3,Balances out rough noise and catchy pep,"3 1/2A solid follow-up to Wilco's triumphant Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finds the band expanding on both of it's complimentary sides of pop-rock and experimental, producing a solid whole album to an effective degree. While it might not hold all the same dramatic highlights found in that previous disc, A Ghost Is Born proved that much of the resounding critical praise was correct."
2,I Think I'm Done with Wilco,"I've tried really hard to like this album, and YHF as well. But I just can't. I've seen the emporer's new clothes and I don't like them. I'm not a closed minded person who only listens to one kind of music, but I just can't take this. And I won't apologize for admitting that I like alt.country music, which Wilco has departed from completely. The last 2 albums are just experiments in noise, coupled with barely audible depressed sounding lyrics. If that's your thing then go listen to Radiohead or Beck's last album Sea Change. Didn't UT and then Wilco start out to get away from this kind of drivel?"
2,B O R I N G!,"As much as I wanted to like this album as much as I've grown to dislike it. There is something missing and I can't really say what it is. Maybe the music wasn't complete or maybe the lyrics were half-assed written or something!Really, if you are not a diehard Wilco fan, skip this album. Try any of their earlier works, which are more accessible and easy on the ears.Terribly disappointing!"
2,Solidly disappointing,"I love A.M., but this album seems very garage-band quality. A Ghost is Born has nothing original or unique, and not much of what made me like Wilco originally. I just don't find static and feedback very enjoyable to listen to. Overall very disappointing."
2,lacking,"This album is a severe disappointment after the amazing Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. A few songs have a good hook a la Heavy Metal Drummer, but the vast majority offer little or nothing."
2,pretty average,"aside from ""company in my Back"" ididn't really feel much of this album. there was some good Runs in terms of Jamming going on but the Vocals&Writing left me kinda blah in spots.I was trying to figure out what the hype was about them&this Album didn't move me enough to fully get it or understand it."
2,Worst Wilco Release Ever,"20% cool. 80% repetitive and dull. They mailed this one in.Suggest earlier releases Being There or Summer Teeth for those Walmart and MickyD listeners who prefer consciousness.If you are a psycho mellon intellectual who prefers a little music thrown in with your ""where did all the time go"" droning and thumping noises, you'll probably enjoy this. Careful not to burn too much energy searching for something that ain't there, though.Tweedy is getting tired. I hope he's gonna be alright. We need him."
3,bought his strictly on hype...,"first, i would like to say i am HORRIBLY offended by the previous review, saying something about wal-mart cashiers and mcdonald's employees. i mean, i work at mcd's. i also go to a university. you gotta get money SOMEWHERE to go to school...geez.anyway, wilco's latest is something i bought completely on hype.. i haven't heard anything previous from them. i certaintly hope it's better than this, though.there are a few mildly interesting tracks on this, but too much of it is horribly unaccesable. don't get me wrong, this isn't always bad (i'm a huge sigur ros fan), but this band isn't doing something right, because i can't get myself to want to bother listening to it much more. these guys have talent, sure. but that doesn't mean they're good.it just annoys me that this band gets so much hype, when other alt rock bands (such as radiohead, modest mouse, and muse) are doing a much better job."
3,"A step backwards, but still a great listen","A Ghost is Born has its moments of greatness, but oftentimes it is overshadowed by mediocre, plodding songs like Spiders (Kidsmoke). This is the track that caused me to believe I didn't like the album at all on the first couple of listens. After I programmed my CD player to edit this song out, the album is an enjoyable experieince. Jeff Tweedy shows his songwriting greatness with song like Muzzle of Bees, Handshake Drugs, Theologians, and Hummingbird. I can reccomend this album highly, but don't judge it by Spiders."
5,Captivating Journey,"A Ghost is born is one of those journeys that you fall down, crack open your head, get up, go on and struggle all the way. However, you look back and strangely enjoy and feel better in retrospect. My advice is that if you are a Wilco fan or just looking for a new CD, go to their website, take the test drive and make your own decision. After about the third time, I was hooked."
2,Please Don't Make Me Listen To It Again,"I'm trying here. I'm a devoted fan of Wilco and it's previous incarnations plus Tweedy's collaborations. Please don't make me listen to this disc again. It's drained the energy out of me. Physically and emotionally taxing. I had low expectations as nothing could really top everything else I listen to by these folks-- I consider this a ""transitional"" album and hope for better things to come moving forward."
3,Their weakest album,"Yes, it's hard because it's still a *good* album but all in all not at all inspiring. I mean, this album is a bummer but not in a a *good* way, if you catch my drift. In other words, it doesn't sound like these guys had any fun making this record. Sure, there's some bright spots like Hummingbird, Theologins and The Late Greats, but even those sound a bit labored. Mostly, it just bums me out.I hate to say this, but I miss Jay Bennett. At least he would've grounded this record and let these guys feel comfortable rockin' out a bit instead of trying too hard. In the end, I think Jeff Tweedy is starting to believe his own press. These guys set the bar high. All their other records are 4 stars are higher. This one is uneven and pretentious. Am I the only one who feels this way? I only see raves or pans here. This is right in the middle. And there's nothing worse than the middle."
2,Weakest Wilco,"Wilco has done some good albums, especially during the Jay Bennett era. This album ranks with A.M. as their weakest. Try Summerteeth or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot."
4,"Love the ""retro"" story line",Love the cast! Humorous view of the not so long ago times when air travel was enjoyable and flight attendents had the aura of glamour.
2,Just so-so as a movie.,"Unless you've been a flight attendant, I would not waste any time on watching this movie. It's pretty much a waste of time."
4,"Fluff, but fun!","What can I say, I like Gwyneth Paltrow. The movie is light and funny, and includes Christina Applegate and Candice Bergen, two more of my favorites. This movie is not brain food, but when I am looking for something to make me smile, the outakes during the credits will do it for me."
3,A GOOD ROMANTIC COMEDY MYERS IS HYSTERICAL,"OK this film isn't going to win any awards, but it is a fun good natured movie that I found very easy to watch. Mike Myers gets the most mileage out of his small part! It's cute, the girls are sexy and its fairly funny.....hey! what do you want? The DVD has a good transfer too."
2,Had potential - but got REALLY clunky,"Fluff piece that should have been a lot more fun than it was. Paltrow is fine, Myers, Applegate, Preston, and especially Bergen, have some nice moments. But the direction lags. Some funny moments could have been really funny - but they weren't. A real problem with pace here. In better hands and with a tighter script, this could have been much better."
1,horrible service,Awful experience buying from Movie Mars. The first movie they sent didn't work. Returned it and they sent a new one...that one didn't work either. There's a reason their movies are so cheap...because they don't work and their service sucks. I'll never buy from them again!
2,Unbelievable,"Can't believe Gwyneth Paltrow did this thing. I kept waiting for some irony. This is straight-ahead, nothing post-modern about it. As such, it's a throwback to the madcap comedies of Marilyn Monroe. Christina Applegate's role is one dimensional, as is Mike Myers'. The script is sort of barfable. Is this supposed to be Austin Powers for women?"
2,"Very bad, but Mike Meyers was hilarious","I watched this film on tv very late at night while I was surfing channels. I'm very glad I didn't pay to rent this, it was horrible. Most of the jokes were not funny and were thrown in for cheap laughs. Also, Gwyneth Paltrow was a very poor choice for the lead role. I think Kate Hudson or Cameron Diaz would have been much better, however, I don't think even they could have saved this bad film. At times I wasn't sure if this was supposed to even be a comedy. In the beginning, it seemed like it was supposed to be funny that Paltrow's character wanted to be a stuartess, but then it's supposed to be serious. Although this movie was very bad, every scene with Mike Meyers was very funny. His character had a lazy eye and he had an erratic temper that often caused hilarious scenarios. If your a Meyers fan, you'd like him in this film, but you most likely will find this movie to be an un-funny chick-flick with bad writing and casting."
2,Dumb. Just plain dumb.,"I actually watched this movie on a airplane. It only had 1 funny scene in it, and the plot was pointless. The only reason I watched it was because on a 10 hr 45min flight what else am I supposed to do? The reason I gave this movie an extra star was because the story was kind of intriguing and that's about it. This movie made Gwyneth Paltrow loook terrible and Mike Myers was stupid let alone funny. Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,"Yikes, this was frightening!!","It's amazing how some movies get made these days, especially this one. I felt compelled to write a review after my girlfriend made me watch this horrid, horrid movie. Seriously, is this really the same Gwyneth Paltrow who starred in quality movies like ""Shakespeare in Love""and ""Sliding Doors""? Was she hurting for money... if so there are better ways. I'm all about silly/stupid movies but this movie isn't remotely funny. Mike Meyers gave me about two chuckles with the lazy eye gag.. which was repeated waaaay too many times.Ladies, if you're looking for a good comedy to watch with your boyfriend, please try ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"". Those are both suprisingly witty and funny and actually have something to say with some interesting characters. I assure you, you will both like those. This movie, however, goes on my top ten worst movies of all time, right above ""Batman and Robin"". I'm still having nightmares about it... the horror, the horror!!"
1,View From the Top,"Well...What kind of a moron gave this piece of crap story the green light. Why did Gwyneth Paltrow do this movie? If you're a ditz and a flight attendent this will be an interesting movie but other that that STAY AWAY. Also... if you make common links, it's a complete wanna be Legally Blonde... I mean look at the two front covers side by side... Absolutely pathetic... and not even funny."
3,To tell you the truth,"THis film was a Gwen Paltrow vehicle; she was supposed to carry the film. To me sure, the producers 'hedged their bets' by enlisting Christina Applegate as a foil and 2nd banana as it were. I got the film not because of the star but because of ms. Applegate, one of the truly greatest sexy/funny ladies in history (OK, name two others...) Ms. Applegate does not have a massive part of this film, but she does brighten any scene she is in and was never ever more beautiful.The film has a viable plot, but it is in the end a 'chick flick' and one cannot escape that. In the end, I felt like I was left out as a male viewer, in spite the attractiveness of the two lead actresses."
5,What A Fun Flight Title.,"I watch this movie awhile back and thought it was heartwarming and funny. a real chick flick that guys can watch without rolling their eyes and going oh my, throughout the whole film, it has also good lessons to learn. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a sweet girl Donna that grew on the wrong side of the tracks so to speak and wants a better life so she starts out at low rung airplane service serving drinks to people until she sees an ad for nice airline school for a better job. this film is just wonderful film and for the life of me, i can't understand why people dislike it. the cast is great Mike Myers is just hoot as the flight instructor at the school, Christina Applegate,Mark Ruffalo they do excellent jobs in their roles also.Highly Recommended"
3,Surprising Romantic Comedy,I don't usually write movie reviews here but I thought this movie deserved a review.This is a perfect example of mixed marketing. I thought this movie was kind of a goofy Mike Myers vehicle that happened to have Gwyneth Paltrow in it but I came to find that it was a very cute and sweet romantic comedy that the whole family could watch.It has a great soundtrack and was quite enjoyable. I definitely think more people need to give this one a look.
3,better than the other reviews suggest! (Really 3 1/2 stars),"I rented this movie despite having heard some very bad reviews and also knowing that it's stay in the cinemas here in Australia was very short... What I discovered was a movie (that despite its supposed endless re-editing) that was funny and heartwarming, and a movie that so long as your not in the mood for the pianist is a well acted little comedy. It's a nice pick me up in a world where not everything is always hunky-dory.View from the Top is popcorn and nothing else, but that dosen't make it bad, it's just not a masterpiece, at least it's a nice bit of popcorn."
4,View from the Top,"This is a cute movie. If you're in the mood for a lighthearted movie- drop this in your DVD. Sit back, relax & be entertained."
4,Guilty Pleasure........,"I'll keep it simple. Emma and Shakespeare in Love are two of my favorite movies ever. I also read romance novels by the ton. On the other hand I am a guy. Gwyneth Paltrow is one of the best and most beautiful actresses of our time. Yet if you check her filmography her early career contains no movies which uhhhmmm ahhhh emphasize Ms. Paltrow's feminity, -- in a modern sense. WELL HERE IT IS, a very guilty plesure, but lots and lots of fun and romantic with a little r too. Ms. Platrow is not only cute, adorable, and hugely talented, but yup she looks GRRREEAT in a short skirt, bikini, or slinky pants. Guilty guilty pleasure. Oh, hurray for actresses like Jennifer Connelly, Minnie Driver, and Julia Stiles too."
5,Wow,"Adorable Gwyneth Paltrow is a young ambitious girl whose dreams are to become a flight attendant and her instructor happens to be Mike Myers whose performance is great as in Austin Power movies.The movie genre is ""ALL-sorts"", a drama, a comedy, a romance - and it is very enjoyable from the start to the end. So you really must watch it.Highly Recommended"
2,Disappointing,"I was really surprised at how bad this movie was. With all the talent involved , it should have been more than the boring TV movie it turned out to be. There was nothing original or particularly funny here. Mike Myers could was not even that impressive. I would not recommend wasting your time watching this film. Sorry."
3,Castle in the clouds....,"Gwenyth Paltrow, prancing around in microminis that show off her willowy body, is a white-trash girl with dreams of leaving behind her drab life by aspiring to become an international flight attendant in this sometimes lame, sometimes funny spoof. No, the year isn't 1965, but it pretty much feels that way. Not as funny as it should be or as cute as it wants to be, this movie came 20 years too late. Some of the obvious jokes fall flat and the ending is lame and predictable, but the cast makes up for the major flaws. The film is a light piece of forgettable fluff that's fun when you watch it, no matter how guilty you feel afterward. I just expected a lot more."
3,really 3 and 1/2 but the don't have half stars,"this is a really cute movie IF you take it as a spoof on the flight attendant business, and you ignore the crumy acting in spots. Also there are parts of it that are really WAY to corny. Other than that it is a cute movie. I really liked it. The acting is splotchy, but there are good areas. It is adorable though. It has a good plot line, that keeps you hooked throughout the movie, IF you like girly chick flicks."
4,Highly entertaining chick flick,The sets and costumes reminded me of Down With Love.This is a very enjoyable comedy with a happy ending the girls will thoroughly enjoy.
3,SNOOTY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS,"The best scene in the movie, is when Donna is dissed by the snooty but lovely flight attendants from a much better airline. Those ladies made the movie worth watshing."
1,A View from the Bottom,"This is potentially the worst movie I have ever made it all the way through. Usually I can spot the really bad ones early on. This one tricked me - I blame it on the cast. On paper, this cast is amazing. I thought for sure the movie would turn around. I just cannot imagine a comedic mind like Mike Myers looking at this script and agreeing to see this movie, let alone be in it. I would like to find the studio person who signed off on this project and ask him/her to super size my cheesburger meal. I feel like 87 minutes was just stolen from life - and I want them back!"
4,Dream Job,"I ran across this movie while browsing through Encore film selections and almost exited past it. Yet, after watching just a few minutes, the film reminded me of when I wanted to be an airline stewardess more than anything else in life, back in the 50s. So, I savored many parts of the movie due to a major case of nostalgia.This film, believe it or not, does not make one feel stupid for watching. You just need a sense of fun. Candice Bergen is great as Donna's mentor. And, seeing the ""bad girl"" get a dose of her own medicine makes one smile.I am buying a copy of this DVD just for the fun of it."
3,"Good Book.....A little too opinionated for me, though....","Definitely buy the book! It is an interesting read as it speaks of the different sightings/events throughout the state concerning Grizzlies. However, it does get a little tedious going through the politics of the subject. Opinions flare and sometimes come off as ""eco-nut"". Anyway, great book on a terrific mystery!"
4,They're out there...,"Dave's lyrical writing style engages the reader throughout this 275 page book, which thoroughly chronicles the fate of the grizzly bear in Colorado. One is left with a sense of wanting to know what's next, what's happened since the ink of this book dried in 1994?Personally, I felt compelled to action, to do my part to help keep the San Juans as wild as possible for those Ghost Grizzlies to have a chance to someday rematerialize."
4,"Comfortable, versatile shoe","I bought these shoes because I was looking for shoe that I could wear during the summertime without socks, but that would be more comfortable, more supportive (and more stylish) than flip flops. These definitely do the trick. They're a cross between a sandal and a tennis shoe and you can wear them with crop pants, long pants, shorts, skirts, whatever--and they look nice. I, too, am having the problem of them rubbing on my heel, but I figure that after breaking them in, that should subside.Another reviewer mentioned that the velcro fastener can be a problem. Because the strip is so small where the velcro attaches, I can see this easily coming apart, and I anticipate that I might encounter the same problem.Overall, though, I think this is a pretty versatile shoe."
4,Great Shoe,This is a great summer shoe that goes everywhere. I had a pair in back and decided I needed the same style in white. I have a very narrow foot and have a hard time getting a good fit since most casual styles only come in M or W. The adjustable velcro strap on the shoe makes this style wearable for me.Marty
4,Really cute!!,"I bought these shoes this week. I shattered my ankle last fall and have had trouble finding shoes that will allow for swelling and stilll look like something you would wear to work... These shoes are cute, comfortable and adjustable for the swelling. I have had some trouble with rubbing on the heel. Would recommend them."
5,I love these shoes!,"I just got my pair in the mail yesterday. I was a little nervous about ordering them, honestly. But I was looking for a pair of shoes that would be comfortable to do a lot of walking in, that didn't require wearing socks, and that would be stylish. I think I found the perfect pair.First of all, these shoes are extremely cute. The details of the mesh/lace don't show up in the pictures, but the design is actually flowers. They are both sporty and classy and great for wearing to work. Today is my first day wearing them and they are surprisingly comfortable. The only issue is that the backs are rubbing on my heel, but I'm sure that's an issue of needing to break them in."
1,Did not like,"I bought these for a trip to Discovery Cove (Orlando, FL) but did not have a good experience. The rubber literally ripped my feet apart and it was very painful. The straps also were not comfortable and I wear a regular size 9. They also came in blue."
3,Calm Mind review,I only gave three stars because I purchased two bottles this product for my mother. It seems to work fine.
4,B-rate movie,"I gave this movie a high rating movie not because it's a great movie but because it's fun to watch. If you don't like b rate movies don't buy. I bought this because I read a music artist I enjoy was in it. Not only was he in it, but also Larry Hagman, the actress who played Shirley on Laverne & Shirley, another actor I recognized from the 8 of Us, and a song writer some of my friends like. Seeing people who would be big in the 80's in a low quality b rate movie made the movie more enjoyable-particularly Larry Hagman because this had to have been a real low point in his career."
5,Its got Randy Stonehill in it its gotta be good,Randy Stonehill gets eaten by THE BLOB while singing to cindy williams.for those of you who dont know who Randy Stonehill is he is a pioneer in christian music and the greatest singer i've ever heard.the movie in general is just plain fun to watch
3,Best viewed under the influence,"An intentionaly funny stab at horror from Larry Hagman, it works as a comedy, and you can't really treat the Blob as anything else. This did terrify me as a child on Sat afternoon TV, and the humor was lost. But put this on today with some friends and a little alcohol, and you'll laugh until your sides hurt. The basic Scooby Doo ""its the kids against the MAN"" plot takes off from the original, but the fashions are much more groovy. I kept expecting Shaggy to show up with a ""Zoinks!""And keep your eyes peeled for the numerous cameos. A great example of a GOOD cheesy movie."
2,The Blob 3:City Of Goo,"The Blob 3 is rubbish,it's about a group of people who see a comet land in their hometown and find out it's a red ball of goo that eats people.The first person you see die is an old lady who sees it crawl up her leg and then a dog who eats it and grown bigger.The dog terrorises the town and eats anything it sees.DO NOT SEE THIS FILM."
3,Looking for a good movie? Beware!,"Beware! The Blob! is a silly, and somewhat legendary, cinematic misfire from actor turned one time (and I mean ONE time) director Larry Hagman (who also acts, ironically, as a mentally challenged dofus that gets devoured by the titular jelloesque beastie). This movie may frighten younger children (The Blob is a rather terrifying concept when given a moments consideration) but adults will only watch in disbelief at the lame comedy touches and even lamer ""special"" effects that range from the passable to the out and out embarassing. But no bad movie collection would be complete without it. Gauranteed to liven up any party."
3,My First Horror Movie Experience,"I haven't seen this movie on ANY TV since about 1985 and I remember when I saw it the first time in 1981 when I was in the 5th grade in school the following Monday I told the class during ""show and tell"" about several scenes including the ""bowling alley"" and nobody except the teacher listened but I enjoyed telling anyways! Elvira hosted the show on KCAL channel 9 in Los Angeles and they showed it a couple more times and I waited very long for it to be available somewhere."
3,"A lot of fun once you go ""Behind the Scenes!""","This camp horror schlock is a heck of a lot of fun to watch (think Saturday night drive in) once you learn that it was Larry Hagman's low budget ""home movie"" attempt at cashing in on the Blob-ularity of the original. All the celebs on board (Cindy Williams, gorgeous Carol Lynley, Dick Van Patten, Godfrey Cambridge, etc etc) are all appearing because they were Hagman's Malibu neighbors and he said, ""Hey! Let's make a movie!"" The rest is runny, red history!"
3,Beware the sequel,"For diehard SciFi fans only. I saw ""The Blob"" when it was new, fresh and really scary. Loved the re-make, but never saw this sequel to the original. Kind of a period hoot, but those with serious expectations for plot, character or good production values will be disappointed. Fun to watch, see the very period costumes, and marvel at how much of a movie you can make with so little in the way of cast, sets, talent, and special effects. A must-see for blob fans, a pass for others.Reeaders need to understand that my standards for these kinds of movies are very permissive - I also like ""Caltiki the Immortal Monster"", ""X the Unknown"" and ""Night of the Blood Beast"", all alternative blobby kind of monster flicks of questionable cinematic value.Now that I've seen it, it will probably languish in obscurity until one of my descendents unearths it from wherever old DVDs end up."
4,A must have book,It is one of the depthful book for Pharmacy students.It covered a lot of information.I found it very resourceful.A must have book for Pharmacy students.
5,Brilliant!,"This book is a Godsend! I was given the opportunity to write the Evaluation Exam for the PEBC in Canada and I had no idea where I was going to get all the information I needed to study. This book is really a 'Comprehensive Review' of what was done at University (and sometimes, what was NOT done too!). There are a few errors in the text which you should keep in mind (don't accept everything as truth without questioning statements occasionally.If you are wide awake, you will spot them. All in all, a brilliant book."
5,Pure Roots,"At first i liked just ""international herb"" and ""Too long in slavery"", but when I listened it more and more I started letting my friends hear how good the entire CD is. What more can I say when a all the songs are good. Plus the music is what got me more into it. The band plays spectacular. my favorite on this album since then is Behold & Stop fussing and fighting. Buy it if you are a roots rock reggae fan."
3,Wall Border does not match up,"I love this theme, but when we got home to hang the border, the width was two different sizes. It was very difficult to match up perfectly. Be sure to check this before leaving the store!"
5,Cute,"This theme is so cute, and it isn't too babyish or busy. We will be able to keep the room decorated this way for quite some time! It is also unisex, so if you plan on using the nursery for baby #2 it works perfectly eliminating the need to redecorate."
1,Measurement please,"I don't understand how babiesR'us expects customers to buy this border online, without specifying the dimensions ( lenght and width)!!!!! Would be very helpful if they would add more description to their products, so it is easier for the customers and prevent a trip to the store."
4,Great Addition to the Nursery...,"This wallpaper border is positively adorable, and will compliment so many different room colors! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that we had to use wallpaper paste to get it to stick. After that, it is now hanging beautifully! :)The border measures 30 feet by 8 inches."
3,"Adorable border, but difficult to apply...","This border looks wonderful, but it is not an easy task to get it to stick. It only took a couple of hours to put up the border according to the directions, and the room looked great. The next day my husband and I discovered that the border was peeling away from the wall. We think it was due to the fact that we used a satin finish paint on the walls, and the border doesn't adhere to this surface as well. We went to a local home improvement store and purchased a pre-paste product and used that on the border instead. That did the trick. I would recommend starting with this technique if you have a satin or glossy finish to your paint."
4,"Perfect for boy or girl, but...","This wall border is the best one I've seen out there and it's made of a good, sturdy, vinyl material. The design is perfect for either a boy or a girl, very gender neutral. The only problem that we had with it is that it doesn't stick to just any kind of surface. Our walls have a slight texture to them, and it just came right off. It's an easy fix, though! Just get a staple gun and staple the top and bottom of the border at certain points to attach it to the wall. Then, go to Lowe's or Home Depot, get some thin wood trim and nail it along the top and bottom of the border. You can do this if you're putting it up against the ceiling or in the middle of the wall. It looks adorable and the best part of all is that when you're ready to take it down, you don't have to worry about peeling or steaming the stuff off and having the glue stuck to your walls. Worked for us!"
2,Lunch Bag,"I love the look of this it is very unique, That's all I can really say that's a positive. That's why I am very disappointed in this product. It really should be called just a bag. The top has the cute flap but that is all it has to keep the food cold or even in the bag. The compartment is big enough for food and drink but they won't stay cold because it doesn't seal it in. If you don't need to pack cold items this would be perfect. Instead of using this as my daughters lunch box for school I use it to pack snacks in for the car ride home from school since crackers don't need to be cold."
3,Demeyere Egg Cooker/Poacher,"This pan is constructed well, heats evenly and poaches eggs perfectly. I gave it 3 stars because I compared it my other Demeyere pots that I bought in Belgium while living there and I found some differences. This pot does not have the Demeyere logo engraved in the handle nor the cover and it was not made in Belgium, it was made for Demeyere Belgium somewhere else."
5,Gift given,I got this for my husband and he loves it. The trays you put the eggs in are easily removed and easy to clean. Our old one you had to scrub to the holders to get clean and the finish was coming off. The finish on this one is great.
2,$'s Do NOT Equal Quality,"The people who have reviewed this pan have been too generous with the praise. There are four SERIOUS problems with this pan:(1) The handle of the pan gets extremely hot. This is simply not acceptable on a ""professional"" grade pan these days.(2) The handle of the lid get very hot. The heat is conducted though the screw that is exposed toward the cooking side of the lid.(3) The lid is an amateur design. Not only does the lid handle get hot, but the handle assembly will fill up with water when put in a dishwasher. Note that the unit (minus the cups) is rated as dishwasher safe. This is not true.(4) The pan does NOT cook the eggs evenly (with all cups in place and filled). You will get very inconsistent eggs in every batch.This pan is somewhat dangerous nor is it consistent enough for restaurant use. An inexpensive Faberware pan from target works much better for home use."
4,Great poacher,"Works well, as advertised. Was able to load some cups, then later load others for various degrees of firmness for different people. Would like to have a little larger cup size, as eggs are rather deep instead of muffin size. Clean up is easy, and smaller size means easier storage."
4,A sailing cookbook for both the head and the stomach.,"This book contains some very practical on-board recipes as well as some very useful information on the stocking of a nautical galley and the storage and stowage of food on board. In addition, the prose anecdotes contained in the book make interesting reading for any sailing enthusiast."
1,Won't stand up to commercial use,"I am a professional user and was very disappointed with this tester. I owned one for several years. The joint between the hose & the threads came loose, and would spin, so I was not able to thread it in tightly. There is no o-ring above the threads, it does not seal well. The hose is too soft and flexible, makes for inaccurate readings.I just bought a Lisle 20250 tester and am very pleased with it. It was a great day when I threw this K-D tester in the trash bin."
3,"Cheap, but not citable.","The reason this edition is much cheaper than others is: it's basically an OCRed version of Wellhausen's Prolegomena. If you are serious about studying this author while citing him, this is not for you (its pagination doesn't match that of scholarly editions); if you're interested about its content only, it's a good deal - compare the prices."
2,Ahistorical,"My comment applies to the publisher's blurb not the volume itself. To claim that Wellhausen's contribution is comparable to Einstein's to physics shows just how unworldly and abstracted from ordinary academic standards traditional liberal theology has become. It is pure, hollow hyperbole. Wellhausen is not only hopelessly dated, his predictions discredited, he's obsolete - his only value is as the marker to a grandiose historical misturn."
5,This is an awesome book,I have found this book so helpful in the processing of learning some roots to words.Its an easy book to work with.
3,Of relevance to the Hay line of Clan Hay only.,I was hoping for more of a history and story but it is more of a generation listing of Hay.
5,"5 stars, but better to buy ""Right Time"" instead","Yeah, I know. This compilation contains the entirety of RIGHT TIME.....but RIGHT TIME has been re-issued in a remastered version which outshines this CD in terms of sound quality.Regardless, this is essential music."
2,Only a 23 minute promo video....,"Buyer beware, this is only a 23 minute promotional video for a festival that took place 4 years ago.$15.99 is pretty darn costly for such a short video.Gothicfest is basically (1) full length SLICK IDIOT performance and (1) full length HANZEL UND GRETYL performance... with a few brief interviews and behind-the-scenes footage.Since my name is plastered all over this release, I feel that I have the right to let my feelings known.I believe the majority of this footage has been on YouTube (for free) since 2006. So please do not blame me if you feel ""ripped-off""."
4,Becky's Mom,"I love this valance. I painted the window trim (and other trim in the room) the sage color from this valance and hung 2 of them on a fat round wooden white rod. The other reviewer is right that it wouldn't look right hanging on a thin curtain rod or if the white trim peeked out from the dips in the valance drapes, but the way I did it looks adorable!! I've had many compliments. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it should have been wider so I wouldn't have had to get two for my extra wide window (I actually have three - one I used where I took the doors off the sliding closet to make a ""changing alcove"")."
5,Perfect Fit,The valence was a perfect fit for our nursery window and the tab tops I have no problem with. It is just the style of the valence. We previously had tab top curtains on that window so the curtain rod was sitting a little higher so it looks perfect with the window. You just have to be smarter then the valence and then it hangs perfectly. :-)
3,"Looks nice, loops too big","I bought this valance because I have the rest of the Malawi stuff in my daughter's room. While it's very cute, I found the loops for the curtain rod are a little big. I wound up sewing them to make them smaller, and now it looks great."
2,Pretty but looks awful when it hangs,"I gave this 2 stars because it is pretty. But I absolutely hate the way it hangs!!! I got it with the bedding set - which I absolutely love, but I wont be putting up this valance"
4,Wittnauer Black Ceramic Diamond Men's Watch,"I am very satisfied with not only the watch, but the place that I ordered it from. They gave me a time frame and they stuck to it. I think it's important to keep people informed. If the people ordering items know thatthey aren't just another #, and you let them know where the item is or even if it's being delayed, then they have a better sense of you haven't forgot about them..........Keep us Informed"
4,THANK YOU SCOTT GENDE,"well to let everyone know that scott gende is my friend from ARIZONA AKA AZ AKA THE DAMN DESERT BUT ANYWAY HE PUT ON TO THE LEGENDS AND I SLEPT ON THESE GUYS, BUT UP UNTILL MURS 3:16 I HAVE BEEN CHECKING THESE GUYS OUT AND THE MORE AND MORE I LISTEAN TO THERE STUFF I LIKE IT, BUT GRAND CARAVAN IS A MUST HAVE ANY FAN OF THE LEGENDS WILL LIKE THIS, ANY REAL HIP HOP HEAD WILL ENJOY IT .SO ANY ONE WHO HAVEN'T CAUGHT ONTO THE LIVING LEGENDS CREW STOP SLEEPING."
2,ehhh,"im a big fan of the legends but this cd sucks. the rhymes are tight but the beats are just whack. eligh needs to change up his style and stop making these weird beats that all sound alike. this cd didnt cut it the first time i listened to it, and it didnt grow on me either. whatever, thats just my opinion."
2,"Sad, yes. Pleasure, no.",I've never read any of Thomsen's works before this and maybe it was a mistake to make this the first. Is it possible this is not the best choice for my first exposure to Thomsen? I have never had such trouble getting into a book before. I finished it on principle but not because the book engaged me in any way. It is beautifully written but rambles on and on. Put me to sleep every time I opened it which made it nearly impossible to finish.
1,"Just awful , a record for dope freaks and hippys only.","Don't get me wrong, I was once a bit of a gong freak. Steve Hillage was for a few brief years a hero of mine and live he could certainly play his guitar. However Green is terrible and marked my parting of the way with all things gongy and silly.The lyrics are embarrassing, I'm taking utter toss. This albumb was so bad I swapped my limited addition green vinyl version for a couple of joints worth of cheap moroccan ( a much better deal)There is nothing close to the great sound produced during Fish Rising, it just carries on like a Valium induced depression until the final side were we are insulted by the magical ohm riff. After this LP I straighten out a lot and now I cannot tolerate anything vaguely gongy with the exception of camembert electric and fish rising. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this one unless you really are a hopeless bong fiend with no life to go back to."
4,Steve Hillage.... Green!!!!!!!,"This is the album that got me into ""Steve Hillage"" & it is quite good... Many fans will swear up & down that ""Fish Rising"" is his best album or ""L"" etc. & they are both excellent albums but ""Green"" in my opinion holds up even better... Steve is just on fire on this album & just let's loose with his excellent guitar work & syntheziser work together... For me ""Green"" shows Steve at his most ambitious & most imaginative... this is a stand out album & an enjoyable one... You can't go wrong with this album... I recommend it highly.... Don't be turned off by fans calling it hippy music or trippy sounding... there is plenty of good music to be heard on this album... Buy it you won't be disappointed...."
3,great but not too often!,"Steve Hillage, man from gong, psychedelic guitar echo man..I do'not know how You got it on the album during these years, but I do now that we all had a place for you in our hearts and still have! This record gives you rock, psychedelic feelings, new age and it's only the style of Hillage. not to be compared with anything and for that time very innovative. addicting though not to often in my car."
5,Fantastic document of swirling space rock,"though 'Fish Rising' might be called Steve Hillage's finest solo album, it bears remarkable influence from Gong and contains most of the Gong lineup, relying on their pool of resources to perform that album, with composition ranging back to his days with Khan. this album , however, after finding his footing with 'L' and 'motivation rising' finds Hillage's compositional skill flowering with a consistently balanced performance as well as dynamic and progressively spacey instrumentation throughout on synthesizer and his wonderful and amazing guitar work. all the songs are strong and enhance the total sequence and progression of the music on this cd. this is another landmark in the field of space rock and is practically the blueprint for the career of the contemporary space/psychedelic band Ozric Tentacles. a stratospheric performance."
5,For Christians who are serious about Wanting to Live Good,"Derek has written for the person who truly believes in God and has decided to make a life-wager commitment. If you are this kind of person willing to go-for-it, who will risk it all for the sake of God-Person completeness, then this is the book for you. It is short book yet complete. Every word counts and if you use it as a handbook, then you will have a dog-eared copy soon after. You MUST want Gods Best. There is a whole chapter on this very point. I wish everyone who reads this book Gods Best! Any YOUR CUP WILL RUN OVER. "" To summarize, I will list the things you must do if you want God's best: 1. Want God's best. Do not settle for less. 2. Focus on Jesus. 3. Meditate on God's Word. 4. Make friends with the Holy Spirit. 5. Hear and promptly obey God's voice. 6. Be careful how and what you hear. 7. Be more concerned with eternal than the temporary. Make sure your priorities are right. 8. Let God choose for you."""
5,For anyone interest in the education field,"You can trust Bear to give you acurate, honest information on the schools he covers. This book is specifically written for anyone looking for a degree in the education field. Childhood development, elementary, ect. He covers it all including teaching credentuals, bachelor's degreees, master's degrees, and doctorates. I've bought other distance learning books but it's hard to go through each school looking not only for creditionals you can trust but also for the degree you want. I like the fact that this book only covers the type of degrees I'm interested in. Bear's also has several other distance degree books if education is not your field of study."
1,huge disappointment!,"As nudists, we're always looking for media that portrays nudism for what it is, a healthy, relaxing, and natural way to live. This is NOT it!!! Naked in the 21st Century has nothing to do with nudism! It is just a wanna-be director's sad attempt at film making. Basically, the premise is that they are making a movie about nudists. The acting is poor and the storyline is well, non-exisitent. Some of the footage of this movie is also in another huge waste of money, American Nudist. Don't waste your money on this movie!!!!"
1,What at waste of money,Don't spent money on this old junk! I should have read some better reviews. This is a true waste of time and money!
4,It works,The remote works fine but the instructions were wrong. I had to go on the internet for the proper program instruction.
5,Exceptional,"The critics from Emap are way off base here. This first Rare Bird album is simply exceptional. It is enchanting, inventive and melodic. It ranges from heavy to almost jazzy-blues soft at points. The vocals of Steve Gould are captivating, and the keyboards of Graham Field and David Kaffinetti are virtuoso. Mark Ashton turned in some unique percussion work on this one as well. This group was simply incredible in their musicianship and songwriting abilities, and it is unfortunate this lineup lasted but two albums. If you buy this one, you will want them all. As Your Mind Flies By and Epic Forest (with a new lineup) are fantastic. Epic Forest is an overlooked gem--simply incomparable. You will be hooked by the depth of the music."
2,IT SHRINKS!!!!,"This is a great hamper . . . UNLESS you ever need to wash it! I loved the look of it, and the mesh liner is a wonderful design. But after washing it for the first time following the manufacturer's instructions (I used cold wash, gentle cycle, and machine dry low), it SHRUNK and is now totally useless! If you get this hamper, plan on throwing it away once it gets dirty! What a waste of money!"
2,OK as long as you don't wash it!,"I registered for this KidsLine hamper to match the KidsLine bedding I got. The hamper looks great but is not very functional. Not only was it a little wobbly/uneven, but once I removed the fabric cover and washed it, it had to be thrown away, as the fabric shrunk and would not fit over the wooden frame. It's fine if you never want to wash it."
5,Great gift!,"I received this hamper as a shower gift and am super pleased with it. I love the removable mesh liner, it makes the trip to the laundry room very easy. It is pretty large and can hold a whole load of laundry so I know when its full that I have a load ready to go. The bedding set I purchased (Lambs & Ivy All Stars) did not have a matching hamper and I am pleased that the chambray color goes very well with the beddng. It looks like it belongs together and it is a very attractive hamper."
2,NOT WASHABLE,"This was a nice hamper for the short time we had it before needing washed. The box and the tag on the fabric said it was machine washable & to tumble dry on low. I had read the other comments before purchasing the hamper that said not to dry it or it will shrink. So, I washed it in the washing machine & hung it up to dry. It STILL shrunk. So much so that it was useless afterwards. I would not recommend this hamper for a child's room, it is too difficult to keep clean and you can not wash it."
3,Do not wash it!,"It looks great, however, I made the mistake of washing it! It does not fit the frame anymore! So if you get this hamper, DO NOT WASH IT!!!"
2,NOT HAPPY.... I WASHED IT!,"I did not read the reviews before I washed and it totally shrank. I am going to try and contact the compnay to see what they will do for me.Before this, I was very happy with it."
5,Love this hamper!,"We purchased this hamper for our daughters nursery and I'm very pleased with it. It did not require any assembly and it does not take up a lot of space. I like the mesh laundry bag that goes inside, it just makes toting all the dirty clothes to the washer that much easier."
3,Warning: This product shrinks in the wash,"Of the three stars I have given this hamper, 1 star is for the attractive design and 2 stars are for the really great mesh bag, which does make transporting baby's dirty laundry to the washing machine very easy, but I must let you know that this hamper shrinks when washed! The washing instructions say it is machine washable and it is attached to the wooden frame by velcro so that it can come off for cleaning. I followed the specific instructions on the label, but when it came out of the dryer it was two inches shorter and would not fit on the wooden frame. Not only that but the fabric was completely worn out.In spite of this, I have ordered another one (this time in pink), because I really love the look and size of this hamper. I guess I will just have to be more careful about keeping it clean, and I'll hand wash it next time around."
2,"Still cute, but very, very little now!","We used this hamper for nearly nine months for my daughter and it has been great. The mesh bag does make it very easy to move the dirty laundry to the washer. After about nine months we decided it was time to toss the denim portion into the wash. Following the instructions I was excited to have a revitalized hamper. Sadly, when I tried to fit it back onto the frame it had shrunk considerably. I will probably be able to rig it by sewing on some added Velcro, but would strongly recommend that you hand-wash and line dry, don't even let the dryer look at the wet item! :) Since I was really impressed with the idea of a washable hamper at the time of purchase we will not be buying one for Baby #2 when the time comes."
1,Very dissapointing!,"I did not realize that this copy of the 5th edition was chopped up and edited down to remove almost all of Ed Ricketts commentary, insights, personality. The folks that took it upon themselves to edit Ed Ricketts out of his own book should be ashamed of themselves!If you are interested in the science only....then this version is for you....if you are interested in getting to know Ed Ricketts as a person through his inspirations, then don't even bother picking this one up!"
2,Inferior,"Received this product dented; however, Amazon was prompt in replacing it. Problem is, the first time it was used and washed, it began to rust. Would not recommend."
3,"Ice blue, not true","The design of the sheet is lovely and the colour combo of blue and white with brown piping is exactly what I was looking for, however I would not call the sheets ice blue. They are definitely darker than I expected. They are also extremely wrinkled even if you you remove them immmediately from the dryer."
3,"Beatiful color, a little itchy","We've had a Nautica sheet set before and our entire comforter is this pattern. Very happy with the comforter. When we needed new sheets, I wanted to keep the pattern so I just bought these ones to replace the tattered old ones. Unfortunately, they are the scratchiest sheets I've ever had. I thought they were pricey enough that they wouldn't be. But I've had them two weeks and washed them 6 times trying to get the itchiness from them. They're starting to soften up, but I would expect $150.00 sheets to be softer. But the color is beautiful, so we'll just keep 'em and invest in fabric softener..."
5,My Review Of Okatsu The Fugitive,"Okatsu The Fugitive is the final chapter of the Leagends Of ThePoisonous Seductress trilogy. Okatsu now finds herself a wanted woman from various samurai clans. Along the way, she befriends a trusting swordsman and together, they fought and slew Okatsu's enemies. I recommend the entire three-part DVD set to any fan of classic Japanese bad-girl films."
1,A Nuisance From Stem to Stern,"Every observation in this book is some kind of distraction from the task of discerning the value of absolutely anything. Broad, exotic and unjustifiable generalizations mainly made to resemble the wisdom of an alien culture at less than a careful examination. This author aspires to be nothing but a profound and well camoflauged nuisance. We all had to learn to avoid such in college as we learned to avoid the kid in the neighborhood who talked you into getting into trouble, and avoided it because he was set to ditch completely when he saw the trouble coming. Saty away from her!"
5,Vey high quality toy,"My 3yo LOVES his tractor. We ordered this accessory with his xmas money and he is ANXIOUSLY awaiting spring so he can keep it filled with water and go ""spray weeds"" with dad. We have been very impressed with the quality of this brand. Other than assembly that was a bit challenging we have been thoroughy pleased - and our kids are not easy on their toys!"
2,No Biliography Abbreviated Footnotes,"Shame on Penguin and Mr. Ferguson for the paperback version which contains no bibliography and has abbreviated footnotes. Persons who buy paperbacks have as great a need for the appurtenances of scholarship as hardback buyers. Further it seems a travesty to publish a book with a revisionist flavor and leave out the underpinnings of the argument, a statement of sources. Not to mention splitting the book in two to gouge the US reader!"
2,Too much Detail,Overall the amount of detail put into this book is way too much. I'm an accountant who loves reading reading economic and accounting books but this book bored me to tears. I understand the author had information that no other author has had on the Rothschild's but we did not need to know every single bond price and transaction they ever made. He jumps around a lot and it makes it too hard to follow or stay interested in. Too much information is not always a good thing. In my opinion this was a poorly written book and I will never read another Ferguson book again.
3,Our World according to Rothschild & Co...,"When people go on about a World power this is the family to be in. From along time back the great minds have tried to understand and emulate the unique workings of the Rothschild Dynasty, this will give the reader an inside into how the Rothschild family built wealth, power and influence within and over every major government around the World.It takes a very special kind of mind to put together the structures needed and an equally special person to build everything around that structure.Don't be fooled, Rothschild may not be known to everyone but in some way they have an effect on everyone."
2,BORING,"This book is about the rise of the House of Rothschild but it is not written for the casual reader of history. This is written for the scholar whose subject matter is economic history. As that is not my field of study, I found the book boring in the extreme (it took me two months to wade through it). However, for the student of Jewish history, it does have some interesting ideas as to the origins of some of the Nazi propaganda."
3,The author must be an anti-Semite,"the book had some good pictures, however prof Ferguson not once, but on numerous occasions, claims to refute the story of how Nathan brilliantly deceived the London Stock Exchange players after the battle of Waterloo, earning $40 billion (2007 prices) in one day. A bit jealous I suppose.Verdict: Ignore the anti-semitic propaganda and the book is worth a look."
3,Better than a GED in the eye...,"Stars: Rich (LFO) Cronin,Blue(Wrestler) Meanie,Scott(Christmas Story) Schwartz.There is these guys who cant even show up for class in a Community College !Then the place they really wanna be is a local bar,And its closing unless someone buys it.The buddies decide to raise the money,Probably similar to making this movie and save the bar.A lot of funny bits,Good cast with even quasi-celebrities that viewers have heard of.Nice script,good little moments and what a perfect ending.This film would be similar to a PORKYS,National Lampoon Fill-In-The Blank or dare I say American Pie series."
1,A very sanitized sporting house,"A cute film but most cathouses are tough, hard, places full of strange, desperate & scary people. This film alludes to some of the problems of running a whore house but because of social restraints could not be addressed. I feel that prostitution ( a necessary evil but still an evil) should not be glamourized & the same goes for some other films that come to mind that try to do it."
4,THE CHEYENNE SOCIAL CLUB,Why this comedy/drama western..directed by the great song & dance man himself..Mr.Gene Kelly..was not on DVD..blows my mind.It was release by National General Cinema which is no longer around..some studio should pick up on it..like Paramount did for Warner Bros..John Wayne's Classics..HONDO..ISLAND IN THE SKY..ETC.Fonda & Stewart right from the GO..were GREAT..going from state to state while Fonda kept on talking away at poor Stewart.Their SUPER with each..they play off of each other just as they are..LEGENDS!!Yes..they were just like Robert Duvall & Tommy Lee Jones..from..'LONESOME DOVE..for sure.And also in WIDESCREEN.Somebody please pick up the ball on this LOVEABLE WESTERN.Thankyou---Jack
4,Stewart Fonda and Jones are winners here,"If you want to sit down and enjoy a movie and LAUGH this movie is for you. Stewart and Fonda are great foils for each other, (I think you could have had a series of picture with these two as these characters and it would have worked.) All the performances are played well, the plot is a great one and frankly the Fonda character (who just can't shut up at times.) just kills me. (In fact the two long speeches at the begining and end were added to the script to give Fonda more lines. It made the character.) Stewart frankly plays his honest honerable stock character, but it is a good stock character and with the right foil (Fonda) the character remains earnist but fun. Not a classic in the true sense of the word (It's no BROKEN ARROW or THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE) but it doesn't try to be. It is what it is and that's an entertaing movie."
5,Great Movie!,"I am not one for western movies, but this is one of my all time favorites-great movie for all to see!"
5,Yum-Yum!,Bella Rose loves these pigs ears!!! Kudos to you and will be back to buy more! Yum Yum she says!!
5,Love All Their Recordings,"This Maine folk group wouldn't immediately come to mind for holiday music, but their collection, Home for the Holidays, is a treat. Their voices blend beautifully on some unexpected tunes, like Lord of the Dance or Lo How a Rose E're Blooming.I highly recommend it."
3,"Not strategies, no focus","In Search of Values (1993) by S.B. Simon offers 31 different and separate exercises (not strategies as the author calls them) to help you clarify your values. The related and partially overlapping book Values Clarification (first edition 1972) by S.B. Simon, L.W. Howe & H. Kirschenbaum offers 76 such exercises. Not all exercises will be equally appealing and useful to the reader. Unfortunately the authors do not help the reader tie the results of the separate exercises together in a straightforward and sensible manner. Better books on values are What Matters Most (2000) by Hyrum W. Smith, Lasting Change (1997) by Rob Lebow & William L. Simon, and Managing by Values (1997) by Ken Blanchard & Michael O'Connor. They offer more focused and coherent approaches to clarifying personal and group/organizational values."
3,Not bad.,"For the price, this is surely a decent holster, and I will continue to use it. There are, however a few defects.-The release is snap is right over the safety on my Kimber Custom II. Compared to a standard 1911, the Kimber's safety is admittedly a little generous, but when securing the pistol, one can easily push the safety off with the thumb break.-The front sight tends to catch when the gun is drawn. Again, this could be a product of Kimber's enhancements.Otherwise it's comfy, quiet, and sits right."
5,"SENT WRONG SIZE HOLSTER ,GALCO IS GOOD QUALITY NAME","WELL THE WRONG ONE WAS SENT I HAVE A SPRINGFIELD XD9 WITH A RAIL,THEY SENT HOLSTER FOR A FIREARM THAT DOESN'T HAVE A RAIL,SO IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME,,BUT IM SENDING BACK FOR A REFUND,QUALITY OF IT IS GOOD AND WITH GALCO NAME BEHIND IT,,I ORDERED THE MIAMI CLASSIC,LEATHER HOLDER SYSTEM. GREAT AS THIS SUEDE ONE ,I ALSO ORDER A GALCO IWB HOLSTER,BASICALLY I'M A GALCO MAN,,I READ A LOT OF REVIEWS ON DIFFERENT COMPANY HOLSTERS N MODELS ,I DECIDED TO PICK GALCO FOR MY SHOULDER HOLSTER AND MY ,IWB HOLSTER"
5,Love it,I remember watching this movie when I was younger and was ecstatic to find it on dvd and available for purchase.
5,battle shell....,"it's GREAT!!!the battle shell feels better than the party wagon,and the missiles are great too.they have only got stuck once and after that they were fine. the winch in the front is cool too. ok first here's are the features on it: room for all 4 turtles and even splinter.4 missile launchers.2 doors on the top of the truck to put them in.1 winch to pull the truck out of tight spots. overall it's great!! kids have to use their imagination on it but that's what it's for anyway. no stupid electronic sounds which is the best"
2,it's junk but my son loves it,"Deluxe, it is not. It is very cheap feeling and looking. The great ""features"" are very unimpressive. Even my 5 year old is working not to be dissapointed in it, having blown his whole 20 birthday money on a plastic box on wheels. It's nothing special as vehicles go, except that it's green and says Ninja Turtles on it.Nevertheless he has played with it non-stop since he got it."
3,An Ok Toy But There Is One Big Problem,"The new TMNT line is pretty neat so far but it can't beat the old line. This vehicle has some AWEWSOME detail. The huge problem is that aside from April and Splinter, no one can sit in it. The Turtle's legs can't be put in a sitting position. They have to stand in the Battle Shell. If you turn their legs backwards they can be put into a sitting postition but their leg joints loosen up pretty bad. I would really only reccomend theis to a die-hard TMNT fan. The Party WaGON FROM THE ORIGINAL LINE IS 100 TIMES BETTER."
4,A great toy for a tmnt lover!!!!,"It is a very fun toy, but not very detailed inside. It is kind of hard to load the torpedos on the side of it. The rope could be a little longer on the front. Overall it is a great toy!!!"
2,Boring!!,"I barely got through this book. In fact, I skipped through about 3/4 of it. I read romance books for ROMANCE! This book went on and on (endlessly) about the character's trek and adventure, and there was very little romance until almost the end of the book. This should be under the ""Adventure"" category - not romance."
4,Outstanding!,This was my first book by this author and it WILL NOT be the last. It was fantastic. I was very very pleased. I don't usually read medievals but this one was great....nice storyline and plot..developed characters..never a dull moment for me. It was different than many other historicals I have read but in a good way. Margo Maguire writes very well and I am now reading her current book The Perfect Seduction which is also excellent so far. Try her you'll like her. I would rather give it 4 and 1/2 stars but Amazon won't allow it so it's 4 stars.
2,Disjointed documentation of the Author's Software,"The second edition of the book is an expanded version of the first edition with the same, lazy, writing style. The author seems to have a problem collecting his thoughts and tends to jump around topics. The writing style is that of a technician with limited technical writing skills. CMP Books could use a good copy reviewer/editor team.If you are attempting to learn networking protocols in general, there are higher quality books available. If your goal is to learn a network stack on an embedded processor (In particular the PIC), this is not a bad book as source code is included. To be successful and focused on the software, you'll need to invest another [$] for the PCW version of CCS's compiler, and another [$] for the Microchip PIC.net demo board (Unless you have very good prototyping skills). Note that the first edition of this book comes with the Microchip PIC.net demo board which is sufficent."
4,"good book for a satanist or luciferian, short but sweet.","Many modern satanists and luciferians practice the styles of magic in this book (qabalah, enochian, dream work) , and even write books about it, but few actually give a new approach or a documentation of of the actual pathworkings done and how it all worked. this book was very interesting in that sense. it is sort of complex but fairly simple, he just took a little bit of each, mixed them together, and did path-workings with them and documented the results for us to see. a very impressive book, although it is short, it was not a let down. not really for the beginner satanist or luciferian, but something to get into once you have mastered the basic magic techniques. i liked this book a lot when i got it, and although i don't really use it, i still may pick it up from time to time.if this book sounds interesting to you, buy it. it is a good read, and a good addition to your library."
3,Good little movie for children,"Well, if your children do not like to read, they may at least watch this movie to learn about The Count of Monte Christo. The movie is enough faithful to the original roman of Jean Rostand and it is a good little show."
2,Face was not centered on black stone...it was low down..,I have seen almost identical rings to this one that are real that go for a couple of hundred dollars. So when I saw this for $20.00 I was thrilled. When I got it and opened the box it was immediately notable that the mother of pearl looking cameo face was very very off centered when glued on the black stone. It was lower than it should be. I will return this ring most likely. If it were centered it would be pretty but you can see a very slight glue edge. As I said for the price if the face were in the center I would keep the ring. Very disappointing. The shipping however was extremely fast and I liked the free cleaning cloth that was included.
3,Borel a creationist? Decide for yourself (not a rating),"French mathematician Félix Edouard Justin Emile Borel (1871-1956) published this popularization of his own work on probability in 1950, near the end of his life. Would the former President of the French Academy of Science react with pride, amusement or outrage to the appropriation of pp. 124 - 126 fifty years later by creationists and intelligent design advocates? One of his on-line biographical sketches may help you to decide (try these two web searches: Borel probability certainty a n d Emile Borel biography)."
2,Really quick read....,The book has a few good moments but generally jumps all over the place. The fact that they introduce new characters all the way up to the end really doesn't help the situation any....wouldn't recommend unless you have some time to kill.....and you are desperate!!
5,Simply Beautiful,"""Celtic Inspired songs & tunes appreciative of nature. Celtic harp, vocals, flute, cello, uillian pipes, fiddle, low whistle, and recorders."" Julia has a beautifully melodic and feminine voice. Combined with her harp, the traditional-sounding folk tunes are like listening to a Celtic angel. Wonderful!"
1,Nashville Cats???,"The pictures are nice, but the title is very misleading. Nashville cats? Possibly ten cat pictures in the entire book."
1,Why is this not available in US for Kindle Download,Would love to continue the series on the Kindle but this book is not available for Kindle download in the US!!??? Yet all the rest of the series is??
4,Fun Heroine,"This is the first book I've read by her and enjoyed it. I was stumped until the end, so that's good."
1,"It could have been a 5 star book, but...",Paretsky's blatant hatred for the Catholic religion killed my enjoyment. I was so disgusted that I won't donate the book to my local library. I put it in the garbage where it belongs.
4,Gets into the character,"KILLING ORDERS is one of Paretsky's earlier V. I. Warshawski novels. In this case her aunt Rosa is accused by her church in committing stock fraud. She reluctantly asks her niece for her help in clearing her name.I have read most of Warshawski's novels and this one is one of my favorites mainly because I got to learn more about her character as well as her relationship with her friend, Lotty. I regret having read them in disorder but I recommend this novel for anyone interested in learning how V. I. got started. Although this is the third novel in the series it tells a lot."
3,sara paretsky,"I have been reading her books for years. This book, killing orders, is one of her first. It is not as good as her later ones, however, it is keeping my attention."
1,Very Disapointed,I was really excited to get this for my grandson and I had to send the first one back because it didn't work at all then I got the second one and it never work Right but it was so close to Christmas that I kept it and really shouldn't have because it NEVER worked right. The ducks keep stopping and the machine makes noises and pops. Not worth the money!!!!
1,Fun idea but doesn't work well,"I bought this for my nephew and it never worked quite right. The game is cheaply made and while it's a fun idea, my nephew never had much fun playing with it because it didn't work."
1,D.O.A.,"My 9yr old just received his delivery of this item. Unfortunately it was a dissapointment as it did not function. The music plays and gun makes a sound but the salty crew do not operate. fresh batteries would not make them rise from the dead, scurvey I guess. ARGHHH them there pirates will have to walk the plank to Davey Jones locker.8-("
1,Nostalgia comes with a price.,This game is fun but my boys broke the gun in one day. It looks nice but it is poorly made. Definately not worth the money.
2,looks fun but looks can be deceiving.,"i played this game twice and i was bored.i gave it to my nephew for his birthday and it just collects dust in his home.its interesting but, the gun isnt accurate.its better to purchase nintendo wii games like carnival games or the like.they will probably be cheaper too and more fun than this thing.a definate 2."
4,Reasonably priced,My young son has asthma and this was recommended on several websites. I'm not sure if it is having a positive effect yet but it is good quality and can't hurt to have. I bought a few to take a long on trips.
3,OK,"This is one of the most hyped of the 90's sXe Posi bands. They were never one of my favorites... I preferred the Floorpunches and Ten yard Fights over this band. Still not bad though. If you're into Posi bands, you'll like it."
5,Answer To A Grandmother's Prayer!,"Thank you, Ms. Grand! As a grandmother, in today's world of ""mega media"" bombarding our children with so much violence, visual ""noise"", etc., I found your book the perfect oasis! Perfect for making ""talking to God"", so natural for young children.Perfect for making it so much easier for adults, to help our children , through the simple language, and questions that lead to great discussions!I think this book will reach beyond preschool, on to self readers!I suggest that parents and grandparents, the world over, shouldhave this book for their young ones, because we all need to feel at ease, safe, and happy while ""talking with God."" To know He is with us always.Thank you again, Ms. Grand... and May God Bless You and Yours!"
5,Turtles Are Great ! ! !,12 - 15 Years ago Turtles were very popular toys... It is Great to see them come back on the shelf and available. After ordering I recieved the product quickly in GOOD condition and was able to get free shipping on 4/07/2003. This toy appears that it should only be played by those who can safely use action figures that have small parts.
5,Great Speakers for what you get.,Don't let the one star people fool you. I don't know a whole lot about speakers but I know what sounds good. When it comes to speakers. I did some research and read my Bose book. If you set these up properly they will blow you away. For tiny speakers these pump out as much as the 12 inch Cerwins I have as my front channels. These should sound great on any 5.1 system. The base is plenty powerful it will shake my windows in a fairly big room. I would recommend this speaker set to anyone and my mom is looking into buying one for her house after hearing them. I listen to classic rock of all kinds 24/7. This is the best system I have heard in the price range. If you know anyone with this speaker set give it a listen. You will love it. Just for your info. I have this set up with a harman/kardon avr 1600 system. Harman/kardon makes amazing systems.
2,Very disappointed,"I'm no Audiophile as it were but I know quality when I hear it. I purchased the Acoustimass 6 (gen IV) on my belief and word on the street that Bose is the best. I'm sad to say don't believe the hype. They are good but not $899 good. The Bass is lame and the treble on the center channel drowns out the rest of the action if anyone is talking in the foreground. I'm running a Pioneer vsx2016 which is an awesome product. Anyway I plan to stay within this price range but take my business elsewhere, any suggestions? They are going to go back next week."
3,Nice if you like fishing,"Our book group read this book. We liked it well enough, but agreed it is more of a man's book. Great if you are interested in fishing!"
2,Well told story about two stupid people,"Two young men are incredibly stupid and self-centered. Fifty years later they haven't changed a bit. Their thoughts and actions are absurd and they are unlikeable people through and through. The plot is ridiculous. Though Jones manages to make it a story that holds one's interest (he is a good storyteller), I felt that I had totally wasted the time it took to read the book. I kept hoping there would be some ""redeeeming moment,"" some final epiphany, but it never came. The book was a major disappointment."
1,Simply Awful!,"This book is consistently incorrect in its usage of terminology. Right from the start, McMurry and Fay have difficulty defining the simplest of terms, such as an ""element"" or ""mass"" (for example, mass is defined as ""the amount of matter in an object"" and then matter is defined as ""anything that has mass"") in a pedagogically coherent way. From the start they also consistently state that objects ""weigh"" 80 kg rather than are of mass 80 kg. These types of problems are abound throughout the book and confuse the reader (it gets worse as you go on!). Two thumbs way down! Use a different text!"
5,The best solutions manual ever,"This is a true solutions manual. This manual will show the student how to work all of the problems in the book. For the first time in my college life I can do my homework without that empty feeling in my stomach that I might be doing it wrong. If you have the McMurray Chemistry book and your teacher doesnt want you to call them at 11:00pm when you cant figure out a problem, this book is a must!"
5,Excellent overview of first year chemistry,"This book is very well written, with helpful diagrams and detailed examples. It is easy to understand and text and with this book it is truly not hard to understand chemistry and do well. I easily got an A in Chemistry I and I believe that everyone who failed the class simply didn't look over the book or their notes after class. It certainly wasn't the fault of the professor or the text- both explained chemistry very well."
5,Very Complete,This book is a great start for the basics of chemistry. In a progressive manner it covers the wide spectum of reaction chemistry.
4,Great little detergent,"I do like this detergent and I use it for most of our clothing items. However, it has optical brighteners that pose a problem for our cloth diapers. On the cloth diapers we are using a detergent by a little company named ""Country Save"" (also available on amazon.com) HE powdered detergent. Eventually we will probably switch all of our clothing to Country Save because of the cost savings and convenience of using just one detergent."
5,Method laundry detergent,I recently bought a washing machine that requires the high efficiecy laundry detergents. I have a lot of difficulty with detergents that have dyes and perfumes added and was disappointed that the local stores had no fragrence/dye free HE products. On line I found the Method brand in fragrence/dye free and decided to try it. I love it. I use a lot less detergent and my clothes come out beautiful.
5,An excellent teaching text!,"This edition of Eliza Haywood's novels is excellent for teaching--or simply pleasure reading! The texts are clearly and helpfully annotated with definitions of older words. The editors' introduction is invaluable as a guide to the life and work of this neglected eighteenth-century writer. The title story alone is worth the price of the book. This edition is a worthy companion to Christine Blouch's edition of Haywood's novel Betsy Thoughtless, published in the same series.Perhaps after a taste of these ribald tales readers will investigate Haywood's lesser-known works, such as the Female Spectator, published in an excellent edition by Oxford University Press. They certainly merit further study and appreciation."
4,"Eliza Haywood, author",Loved her two novesl; Miss Betsy Thoughtless and Love in Excess. I wanted more of her works.This book of her shorter works is put together very well. She must have been an amazing woman.
5,Masterful,"Anthony really poured his soul into this one! Layered, textured, thunderous, and delicate, this piece has it all. Expertly produced by Ant and Simon Heyworth (of Tubular Bells fame), this album showcases that Anthony was the visionary behind the original Genesis sound, and why they had to eventually part ways.I have a Pavlovian response to the intro and the 2:30 second outro of this two-part opus. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the album is breathtaking too, but those two bits send me over the top.To truly enjoy this CD, I recommend at least 300 listens, as I have done. After you've accomplished that, it will finally be time to dust off that bottle of 1947 Petrus and enjoy the two simultaneously. But have this consolation; if the wine has somehow managed to turn, don't worry, Slow Dance will continue to improve with age!"
3,Not much information in these.,"It was disappointing to find so little information about the things seen in these dvds. Birds were never identified, even when the camera focused on them. The blue whale one was much too repetitive - with good editing, it would have been a very interesting 30 minutes. Same for 'Relentless Enemies'. That one made a great point of showing a young lion up a tree and in danger from strange lions - but never said what the outcome was. We had hoped these would be good teaching tools, but there isn't much here except superb photography.'."
1,ULTIMATE waste of your money,"If you are looking for about 10 minutes of actual valuable content in every DVD (and I am being generous with 10 minutes) this is the video for you. There is very little useful information or nature content, most of the content of each DVD is very repetitive. Super disappointed. Waste of time and money."
4,"Poorly written, but great info","This book is really poorly written, with factual errors and sophomoric humor. Many of the musicians are poorly represented, some with merely a reference. But what is amazing is how many great musicians are from Texas. I found myself thinking about the information I learned from this book a lot, and I found myself recommending the book for its information to a number of people as well. Don't look for a literary experience, but you might get a lot out of this book."
4,"GREAT BOOK, but","I WAS HOPING TO READ MORE ABOUT CERTAIN ARTISTS LIKE ""JOHN NITZINGER"" AND ""B.W. STEVENSEN"" ,BUT THIS BOOK DOES HAVE GREAT RANGE IN IT'S ARTIST INFO!KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ""NITZINGER"", HE'S COMING BACK AT YOU!!!"
1,Is English his first language? Must be!,"The saddest part of the story is that libraries all across the US had to buy this book as one of the only two available print references on TX Music. I bet most English writers in the third world can write much better. Contentwise, the book does have some of the requisite basic information. But that's about all."
4,Furminator Fine,"My order came in a short time (and it came from Hong Kong) and arrived in good packaging. My cats are young, and perhaps they don't have the amount of hair to be removed yet. Also, I'm hoping that warmer weather will mean I can de-fur them outside more vigorously. I'm not getting as much volume as the videos online suggest."
3,"Works, but Too Messy","I have four short-haired cats and in this hot weather, even a slicker brush and fine-toothed comb don't do the job.I ordered the Furminator, the price was right and the reviews were very good. The product came to me in excellent condition and my cats had no issues with it. Here's the problem: the large amounts of hair that came out of their coats flew all over, coating my granite center island with a massive dusting of hair. These are cats that are combed regularly, so the good news is that the product works...the bad news is that it creates such a mess that I prefer not removing all of my cats' hair. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be happy to give it another shot."
5,deShedding for sure!,"The FURminator has definitely helped reduce shedding in my shorthair cat. I brushed her heavily a few times with the FURminator, and now I just brush lightly twice a week for maintenance. She doesn't seem to mind the brush."
5,This is awesome,"My cat is a terrible shedder (is that a word?) and this works even better than I had hoped! My cat is a little afraid of it, but hopefully he will get used to it."
4,i like it,"it was too expensive at the vet or at petco/petsmart to purchase. it works great, if your cat loves to be brushed. i have recommended to everyone, just remind them to buy it here and dont overpay!"
4,BEST DESHEDDER,"I only give this 4 stars soley because of the price; Amazon had the best price, but it was still a bit steep. This tool worked better than anything else. I had been using a flea comb strategically angled, and that worked until it got old for the cat, who let me know when she'd have enough. A brush was useless, and those mitts and wire ""slickers"" were laughable.When I started using the FURminator, I was ready for a fight; but my kitty did not seem to mind, and I was able to remove handfuls of loose hair in a short period of time. My cat looks and feels better!"
5,Amazing Product!,The Furminator is a great product that actually delivers. My cat loves being groomed with the Furminator. I would highly recommend this product to friends and family.
3,Not that great,"Meh. All the hype got me in a whirl that I had to get the FURminator to reduce the amount of fur around my house from 2 cats. This product is probably better for long-hair cats. I've got two short hair. They both love being brushed, but were not very happy with the FURminator. You've got to be careful to not get their whiskers...and both my cats love their whiskers brushed with the regular brush. So you can imagine they didn't find the experience too wonderful to come back the next day. I show them their regular brush and they come over immediately to sit on my lap to be brushed, but not when they see the FURminator. On the plus side, it does remove fur, but I didn't see a difference with the fur I pull off their regular brushes."
5,Furminator,"I bought the Furminator because my cat was shedding so much I was finding clumps of fur all over my house. When I got this brush I was able to remove a whole cat's worth of fur off of my cat. Since I've been using it, my cat's coat is more shiny and soft than it used to be and I'm not constantly picking up fur balls around my house. I would recommend this to anyone who has an animal with a shedding issue. It's definitely better than any other brush I've used in the past."
5,Cat furminator,"This really works. I combed my cats daily and got fur out, but Furminator gets so much more out. Since my cats loved to be combed, they love the furminator. I wish the handle were not so thick, but I guess that fits most hands better than mine. It is truly an amazing tool. Amazon's price can't be beat."
4,It actually works.,"Decided to give this thing a try. Have a furry 4 year old calico.A bit pricey maybe, but it works pretty well. Have to constantly pull the fur out of the comb with each pass, so not super fast, but it works.Cat doesn't seem to mind it too much. She's not crazy about it, but she doesn't run away in terror!! I guess she thinks it's a bit like petting her.I would recommend it, but you will have to use it regularly to have any real effect on keeping the shedding noticeably minimized. You can't just use it for a few minutes every few months, and of course, you use it the most in the spring when they start to shed their winter coat. It takes off handfuls then!!! Shocking really. I do it outside on the porch when it's that bad. What I don't manage to collect for the trash, the wind takes care of."
5,amazing,"I HAVE A SHORT HAIRED CAT. I HAD HAIR EVERYWHERE IN MY HOME. I ORDERED A FURMINATOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN GETTING RID OF SOME OF HER EXCESS HAIR; BUT, I WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZED AT HOW WELL THIS LITTLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WORKS. AT FIRST SHE ONLY LET ME GET A FEW COMBS WITH IT; BUT, AFTER A VERY SHORT TIME, SHE WOULD GET ON MY LAP AND WAIT FOR ME TO BRING OUT. SHE LOVES IT NOW AND THERE IS MUCH MUCH LESS HAIR FLYING AROUND OUR HOUSE. I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYBODY I KNOW WHO OWNS A CAT.MARYANN FROM MAINE"
1,The Bald-inator,"FURminator deShedding Tool with 1-3/4-Inch Edge for CatsThe worst--a 6"" bald spot on the back of our cat--literally bald. We threw it away."
1,Sure glad this product never arrived!,I ordered this item a couple of months ago. It never arrived. I wrote a negative review of the company. I got a personal call from someone named Scott (as I remember). He apologized and said that if I would retract the negative review he would send me the Furminator at no charge. I thought that was decent. Well...for the second time no product ever arrived. By that time I'd had time to ask around and learned that most of my friends did not like the product unless you wanted to scalp your cat. Some people might like this product and find it useful. If you do just don't buy it from a flakey company.
1,Perfect for my shedding cats,"I received my FURminator today, and my two cats are ""standing in line"" to let me use it on them. It is great! Be sure to have a place handy to put all of the cat hairs you are gathering - a box, a baggie, a sack - , as they come off really fast and in big globs. Much better than a brush because the ""tongs"", ""tines"", ""thingys that grab the fur"" are really a short distance apart - maybe 1/8 to 1/16 inch apart.Great product !"
1,Did not receive,"Item was noted as ""in stock"" when I ordered it. After it had not arrived in two weeks time, I e-mailed the seller. After several attempts to reach the seller, I was told the item was back ordered. I canceled the order and bought the item at my local pet store."
5,AMAZING!,"This tool is amazing, miraculous, really.....I have a long haired tuxedo kitty with a thick undercoat that defied all forms of brushes, combs, de-shedding rakes, etc. And she was getting bad hairballs no matter what I did.....at the end of my rope, I bought the Furminator...it was amazing! It got off all the undercoat without touching her topcoat....when we got done, like the pets in the ads, she was surrounded by PILES of fur that I had gotten off of her....she even looks like she had lost WEIGHT! We just touch her up with it every week now and it keeps her de-shedded....and needless to say, her hairballs are no longer a problem. This is a must-have for long-haired cats....I can only imagine what it would do with a persian or himalayan! And the big one is great on dogs...."
1,Cuts fur off,"I wanted a brush. Meaning something to remove fur not cut it off. I gave one kitty a bald spot, so I know it wasn't just removing the already shed hair. Otherwise he'd be bald every time I bath him. It explains the mountains of fur in the commercials but was very disappointing. I suppose if you want to thin out your pet's fur it could be useful, if you have a regular comb hand for after wards."
5,Trying to make one of those hairless cats,"When I began Furminating, so much hair was coming off of my cat that I thought maybe I could make one of those hairless cats like you see in pictures; all skin. After an hour of Furminating I had a large pile of hair, enough to fill an average size moving box. The cat looked alright, and was in fact writhing in ecstasy from the Furmination. Feeling encouraged, I thought, ""This Furminator rocks. I'll have a hairless cat in no time!"" So I Furminated more, filling up box after box with hair. It is now late evening, and after eight hours of straight Furminating, I have six moving boxes full of hair. However, the cat still looks exactly the same, with the same amount of hair on her as before the Furmination. I am pretty disappointed and don't understand how this is possible. I believe the fault is with the cat however, rather than with this product, so I gave it five stars."
5,Cats love it!!!,"Bought because vet had one and wanted too much for it. Got a great price here and the cats LOVE it!! Can't get them to sit still for anything else but grooming time. Works wonders and pulls out the old dead hair that they shed everywhere. Might want to groom on newspaper or hard floor, not carpet, as this will definitely get alot of hair off them. Best grooming product I've found."
3,Love/hate relationship,"This grooming tool for le cats is everything it's cracked up to be. I love its functionality. However, my cats hate it and one or two strokes is about all I can get--if that. It works very well if your feline population will allow."
4,Wonderful but be careful,This works very well for getting excess fur off of the cat and cutting down on the fur all over the house...just be careful that you don't press too hard or go over the same area too many times because it will irritate your cats skin!
5,Everything you hoped for and more!,"Just get it. It's amazing. I've got five cats, two with long hair, and have tried lots of combs and brushes, of which this is the best ever--and miles better than the next-best. Stop buying other ones! All the ones you will not buy will pay for this one, and you will be done!You simply will not believe how much hair it pulls off, and that with very gentle use. Teeth are sharp but so close together I don't think you could hurt a very furry cat (it will fill with hair before it could possibly bite the skin). I will be careful on my new, very sleek little Siamese-y kitten (who has so little hair he feels noticably warmer to the touch than most cats!). I'll be ordering another one for my sister (two cats), and a larger one for myself for the two Big Guy cats I've got, just to make it go faster.I would give this six stars if I could; five just seems stingy."
1,Not a Real FURminator,This was a fake. I couldn't believe it was soooo much cheaper than in the pet stores... and now I know why. I did some comparison after giving in and paying for the real thing and other than the packaging which was clearly fake... there were also differences in the comb. I was mostly concerned about hurting my cat so won't be using it. Just wanted others to know.
5,Awesome tool!,"This FURminator is AMAZING! Our short hair tabby cat sheds like CRAZY, and this tool really works to remove the loose undercoat, where the shedding is mainly from. Honestly, we could build another cat with the hair we get off of him every time we use it. And that's hair that is NOT on our furniture or clothes (or in a hairball on the floor!) ;o)So if you have tried everything else, and you can still pet your cat and get a handful of hair -- definitely try this!"
5,Works well,"I have comments similar to those posted for the small Furminator (the one not specifically marketed for cats). It took off a fair amount of under-fur, my cat enjoyed the process, and there's significantly less shedding so far. My cat's coat is also softer, shinier and sleeker now."
5,Five cats + Furminator = One happy gal!,"With four active inside cats and one that's inside/outside, we have fur-bunnies all over the house all the time. In desperation, I ordered the Furminator and I am tickled pink! One little guy is still nervous about it, but the others love it. One in particular has an extremely dense short-hair coat, and he gets excited when he sees the Furminator. He leans into it, turns around so I can groom the other side, rolls over, hops up to bat the excess fur around, and just purrs and purrs. He's shedding less when I pet him. Living in south Louisiana, the heat can become overwhelming, so I was happy to realize how much thinner the coats feel when I'm done without looking too thin. In fact, with triple digit heat indexes for the last few days, the cats have been sleeping a lot. That is, until they were Furminated. Now they're playing like kittens on the first cool day of the year!"
3,Eliminating the fur,"I had expected better results with the FURminator. It did O.K. with my medium long hair cat, but not any better than a less expensive fur rake does with my long thick fur cat. I suggest going with a longer width than what is recommended for cats. In my opinion, the short width of the tool made it tedious when combing my extra large cat.If I had had the opportunity of trying this product before buying, I probably would not have bought it at the given price."
3,"Works well, but my cat hates it!","I was so excited to receive my Furminator and use it on my cat. It works really well- it takes out clumps and clumps of hair- I didn't even know she had that much hair on her body! But then the clumps of hair end up flying around anyway.And my cat absolutely HATES IT! She is such a sweetheart, and using the Furminator is the ONLY time I have ever heard her hiss at a person. She doesn't even hiss when a 4-year-old pulls her tail! She bites and scratches me, making it impossible for me to use it, and the Furminator has turned my cat into an animal I don't even recognize! She doesn't mind a normal brush, but she HATES this.It sucks to buy a cat brush that's this expensive only to find out that you can't use it on the cat."
4,FURminator v. Zoom Groom,"I've always used a Zoom Groom on my cats, but I recently bought the FURminator for our newly rescued shorthair that has an unusually thick undercoat. After using the Zoom Groom on her, I used the FURminator and found that it removed even more fur than the Zoom Groom. Use of either tool is best when followed by a flea comb to help gather up the loose fur to prevent furballs when the cats groom themselves. I gave the FURminator 4 stars because all our cats prefer the Zoom Groom to the FURminator, even though I am very mindful and gentle when using the FURminator."
2,my cat doesn't like to be brushed with this,"The brush is effective in removing fur, but it seems to irritate my cat's skin - no matter how gently I brush, he doesn't like it and will wriggle away. (The comb has sharp metal teeth.) So I can't use it unfortunately."
5,Cat Shedding no more,"I have 2 short hair cats that still shed like crazy, once I used the Furminator, all the loose hair that falls when they prance about no longer happens. What a great invention....I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns a cat."
5,Furminate Me!,"Both of our cats enjoy being Furminated. Our oldest female previously did not enjoy being brushed and therefore had some mats. Now she lies quietly allowing us to comb her through, even turning to do her other side. Our male gets so excited that he can hardly stand still to be combed. He slithers from side to side as if high on catnip. We have used the Furminator a half of dozen times and have accumulated a grocery bag full of fur! The amazing feature of this product is how well it extracts the undercoat and how much they enjoy being furminated!"
4,It definitely removes a lot of hair!,"My long-haired persian kitty HATES to be groomed and mats if you look at her funny, but this is the only product that she has purred to (for a minute at least). It definitely removes a lot of hair from her dense undercoat, and has cut down on her shedding. She also hasn't had any substantial new mats in the three months that I have been using it (in addition to daily grooming). Note that it can't be used until all mats are removed, so its more of a preventative than treatment device if your cat mats easily. Also, make sure you use it in a place that can be cleaned up easily, because you will be coated with clouds of cat fur!"
5,A MIRACLE TOOL!!!,"I have long haired, heavy coated Ragdoll cats. I was a skeptic, but thought I'd try it. Shazam!! This tool rocks! I raked out handfulls of undercoat on the first setting. Very, very highly recommended!"
5,FURminator,"This tool is excellent in helping with pet grooming. It removes hair painlessly and easy from your pet. As much as you brush your pet, this tool removes the loose undercoat hair that a brush does not collect. My cat does not mind being combed with the FURminator."
2,old brush works better,"Don't bother with this product. I can get some fur out of my two cats, but not nearly as much as the old brush. In this case a picture was NOT worth a thousand words!"
3,FURminator,"Got this after reading all the great reviews online. It works but it is taking time for my cats to get used to. They are more used to the Zoom Groom brush. It definitely pulls out the undercoat, but I think my cats feel it yanks on their fur a bit much. I think this tool will be great to have when spring rolls around."
4,Never knew my cat had that much fur!,"This product works like a charm. I have used this on both of my cats and it's amazing how much fur it removes. My cats do have to be in the mood for this though; sometimes it seems to bother them, at other times they enjoy it. This product has greatly reduced the amount of fur left on furniture, and it's made both of my cats' coats visibly smoother and softer."
4,furbomb,I have two cats one of which we nicknamed furbomber and she was the motivation for buying the furminator. The furminator works really well but furbomber does not like it; she really enjoys being brushed by the other brush. Oh well. My other cat loves it and it really works. I didn't realize he had that much excess hair on him since he is not really a shedder [at least by comparison].
4,Works well,This tool does a very good job of removing pet hair. I wish I would have bought the larger size as I have a larger cat and the bigger tool would cover more area. I only drawback to the tool is the hair does not accumulate on comb very well but sloughs off onto the floor so you have to grab the gobs with your free hand as they collect on the comb or let them fall on the floor and pick up them up afterwards. But it does remove loose hair as advertised.
4,Shockingly Good,"I had a cheap brush before this that would only grab the loose hairs on top of my cat, and didn't do anything for his mass shedding. The FURminator on the other hand got way down into those under-layers. My cat barely sheds when pet now and looks and feels softer.The only negative effect that I've come across is sometimes when I'm brushing him we build up static energy. There's been a couple little blue sparks. Luckily my cat is tolerate and doesn't mind."
3,Less fur balls!,"My one cat has a terrible time with fur balls. But since using this twice a week, he hasn't had any problems. It works best on those cats with a thick curly undercoat. It hasn't really done much to the amount of shedding, that I have noticed. The cats aren't crazy about it. But they tolerate it enough to get a few handfuls of fur. I think the brush head is a bit small for my two male cats, but don't know if the bigger head would be tolerated...It does grab the fur tho...and has helped my one cat tremendously."
4,works good,takes off a good amount of hair from my cats. I use it once a week to reduce the amount of shedding around the house.
2,Covered in Fur...,"I purchased the 3/4"" Furminator based on a glowing recommendation from a friend and am now terribly disappointed. It simply does not remove fur from my cats as well as I had hoped. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I have paid less for combs and brushes and gotten better results. The furminator is now lost in a junk drawer somewhere in my home with other disappointing purchases. =-("
4,Furminater,"Three of my cats love it, they look great and the other three won't let me near them with it. If your cat will let you use it, they will shed less, look smooth and enjoy the interaction. Great product and so much less money on Amazon."
5,The BEST cat accessory ever,"I bought one of these for my cats, and after that, I lost track of how many I've given as gifts and/or talked about. This tool is incredible. I brushed my cats every night; however, when the FURminator arrived, the first time I used it I ended up with handsful of that fine downy underhair you don't even realize is there. I'd recommend it without reservation. Also bought the doggie version for my son's dog with the same rave review from him."
2,Electric clipper blade on a stick,"I have 2 cats (one is a tabby mutt, one is a Maine Coon mix) and a small apt...so I know a thing or two about clouds of cat fur. I was a bit nervous about spending $30 on a brush, but this product has tons of awesome reviews. I had it for several day and it didn't do anything. It didn't remove any more fur than a regular brush. The cats didn't like how rough I had to be to remove any fur. In fact, I have a retractable travel brush that works WAY better than this, and my cats love it.Upon closer inspection I realized it was just a blade from an electric clipper attached to a stick. Seriously, take a close look. If this works for your pet, buy your favorite shaver blade and glue it to a stick and you'll save your self a some money. Or better yet do what I do in the summer...shave the cats lion style! No shedding, AND they're full of vigor!"
4,A comb with cutting edges between the teeth,It's basically a comb with cutting edges between the teeth. Great item if you use it regularily -*REGULARILY* is key- on double-coated (long or short hair) cats.NOT good (at all!) for single-coat long hair cats.
3,"works, but...","It seems to work well, but my cat seems to be somewhat sensitive to it. Jumps around alot. I get around 90 seconds worth of brushing before the claws come out. Fur flying everywhere(have a vacuum handy). Admittedly, my cat is stranger than most, and this may not be a problem for you. It does work better than other tools I've tried."
2,Waste of money.,"My cats do not like it at all. They won't even let me near them with it.Don't waste your money. Check outShedMonster De-Shedding Tool for Medium to Long Coats1,000 times better. My cats love the ShedMonster."
5,Excellent product,"After all these years and a fortune on brushes, along comes the FURminator!! I can't say enough about this product. Happened on it while searching on Amazon one day and decided to look into it further. Reviews were great and when I decided it was time to try it, the price was $15.59!!! The same product was $49.99 at the pet stores so I ordered it immediately. It arrived when they said it would (free shipping) and we couldn't get it out of the package fast enough. We immediately started to brush our cat, and what we saw was amazing. After 10 minutes of this, we agreed the product is better than we could ever hope for. Our cat loves it, but the best thing is he won't suffer with hairballs anymore. Don't hesitate, order it, this is even better than they say it is!!! Today I am going to collect all the products I purchased for hair removal and throw them in the trash!! Thanks FURminator!!!"
5,FUR ELIMINATOR,This thing blasts through fur. One of our cats has an incredibly thick undercoat and after a few brushes with the Furminator she was like a different cat.
5,No more hairs falling off!!!,"My dog doesn't shed much but since he is a long haired dachs, I decided to get him a good brush that would help growing hairs by removing dead ones from his body.It simply just works as seen on TV or Ads.This is an amazing product that I think every pet owners must get for their dogs."
5,Great!,"The Furminator is great, it really works. The actual comb part is just like the Shedender but the design of the furminator is so much better and alot easier to use. My cat isn't happy with it but I am happier not having big clumps of yellow cat hair all over my furniture and clothes."
4,Works,"This tool is fantastic! My cat didn't like it at first, but then grew to enjoy the groomings. This is perfect for any pets that leave hair everywhere. I brush her once a week and she hasn't had a hairball since, before she used to have them at least once a week."
5,Does the job well!,"There are some newer versions of this product that make the hair easier to get off the brush, but I find it pretty easy to remove it from this one - it doesn't get stuck in between the teeth of the comb, and you can simply pull off the hair and toss it in the trash. Even with my short haired Abyssinian I can get several large clumps of hair a day, and he seems to enjoy it as well!"
5,Awesome.,"Works great, removed another cat worth of hair from one of our cats. Couldn't believe how much it was collecting.Awesome tool!"
4,works good,"we got a damaged one- for cheaper. anyway, it works great on our cat. we only use it for knots or matted hair. we have another brush that we use for up-keep, the best being almost a comb type of thing, but when things get matted up with the winter coat, this thing is by far the most effective and seemingly painless (as long as we're not super aggressive) way to get the matts removed."
3,Works But Cat Hates It,"The FURminator definitely removes hair from your pet. I bought it for my cat and it does the job. However, it does not appear that it would hurt, but I believe it must. My cat is not easily scared, and she definitely does not like the FURminator when I get it out. I can also tell that it catches in her hair and can easily pull it."
4,"My cat hates it, but it helped reduce fur balls","My cat really hated being brushed with this thing. It did get some loose fur off of her, but not as much as I was hoping. She's been trying to hack up some fur balls, so we thought this might help. We did notice that in the few days following, she was coughing significantly less. I just don't think she will let me brush her with it again, even though I was being extremely gentle with it."
2,FURminator,I was disappointed. My cat is long haired and I found I was giving her a razor hair cut rather than combing out all the loose hair. She's a heavy shedder and she hates being combed or brushed. I was hoping this device would make it easier but I'm back to square one.
4,funminator for cats,"It works really well removing the undercoat and mats, but the critters aren't that fond of it, have to give lots of time between groomings"
4,A whole new cat...,"This brush is almost too capable, in that it's sort of an intensive experience for the cat. Like some punishing deep tissue massage, he can only handle so much. At the end of it, though, there enough fur to roll into a decent sized ball and give to the cat, which baffles him."
5,Fabulous brush!,This is a great buy! My cat loves it and it definitely helps get rid of all his excess fur.
5,Great product!,I absolutely love the FURminator! I can't believe how much hair it picks up! Great product!
5,Works great,Could not believe the amount of fur it removed from my cats. They don't mind me using it on them at all. I have 2 short hair cats and highly recommend for them.
1,My cat doesn't like the furminator,"My cat loves to be brushed so I didn't think this would be any different. However, she runs away every time she see me get out the furminator and makes unhappy cat noises when I try to use it. I tried being very gentle with it because it seemed to hurt her when I used it as shown in demonstration videos (making sure not to go over the same spot too many times) but then it just doesn't get any hair at all. I'll probably give this away and try one of the competing products that are supposed to not pull on the skin as much."
4,Furminator terminated fur,"My vet recommended a furminator for my long haired cat, but the ones I found at Pet Smart and other Pet stores were extremely costly. I came to Amazon to search and found this one at much lower cost. It doesn't have any extra bells and whistles, but it's great none the less. My cat loves it too and I took off a huge pile of hair in the first brushing. Another plus, I ordered the brush on a Wednesday afternoon and it arrived on Friday a.m. The only drawback is the slightly longer edges on each side seem to bother my cat a little. I do suggest, as the instructions say, to make sure you use this in an area that's easily vacuumed. It causes a lot of hair to fly around. Great tool.. Thanks to whomever invented it."
4,Works well,"Our cats are really annoyed by standard brushes, but they don't mind the Furminator. Gets out tons of fur. Loses one star for the high price."
2,Arrived broken,"This arrived broken; I made no effort to replace it because I'm so busy, but I was disappointed."
1,Works. But Not For All Coats,"I bought this for my long-haired Maine Coon who loves to be brushed/combed. It works just as described. (Even on a short haired tabby who doesn't like to be brushed.) My MC loved it. I loved having less hair around the house. However, after a couple of months of regular use, I noticed that he was matting up on his hind legs. This had never been a problem before.I'd work the mats out, only for them to return. A couple were so bad they had to be cut out. There was one so tight I couldn't cut or work it out. It had to have been painful for him.As soon as the weather warmed up, I had to have him shaved (At the cost of $120). That one mat was so bad, it left a longterm ""bruise"" in his fur/skin. It's been almost a year since and the matting has not returned. I have not used the Furminator in that time either.The only thing different in our lives was the use of the Furminator. So my guess is that it caused this problem."
1,not that great,The small design doesn't work well for my 2 cats. The comb itself is too small and the hair doesn't stay in the prongs. It goes all over you! I don't recommend this brush.
3,Cat not cooperative,"FURminator deShedding Tool with 1-3/4-Inch Edge for Cats :My cat, Pit2nya, was not cooperative.I could only sit on her for a few minutes at a time.Thus, instead of getting enough fur to create another cat,I only got a kittens worth, even though she is a long-hair.If you are lucky enough to have a wuss of a cat, you will have better luck."
3,really didn't work well on our long-haired cat,"We have a long haired cat and were hoping that this would help with her grooming. Unfortunatly, this didn't help in any way. We have to cut the mats out of her superfine hair. Certainly might work for other hair types."
5,Best cat tool I ever bought!,"The FURminator really works! Wish I had owned one years ago! I recommend using it outdoors, as the fur really flys!"
1,Not worth it,"I had tried a Furminator my sister owned, and bought this one thinking it was the same thing. It wasn't.I really like the brand, but this particular product was staticky, so the fur stuck to it and to my hand, which made it really hard to use. While it worked for getting out some of the fur, the short teeth seemed to really irritate my cat, to the point where he tried to bite me (the one I tried before didn't have either of those problems). I'm going to have to see what my sister bought and pay the premium to get that model, wherever I can find it."
2,Unreasonable return policy,"You of course can not read the instructions or test the item unless you open the package. If the item is unsuitable it can not be returned because the company will not accept returns on open packages,"
3,Works but there's other stuff out there at a better price.,"I have several cats and while this works, it is expensive. I get the same result with a slicker (typically used on horses). The slicker for horses is a thin strip of metal with handles on each end. The device is 'folded' into a U shape so that the handles meet. You then run the U shape over your cat. I get TONS of fur off the kitties. The furminator is heavy so if you have a lot of kitties to groom, it gets tiring. It works but at[...] bucks you'd be better off going with a slicker."
5,Fur - Be - Gone!!! :0),"My furry friend, Ms. Bebe, loves it; I love it; works beyond my expectation! Worth every penny! Can't go wrong with this one!"
5,Great Product!,My vet recommended this comb to help eliminate shedding and hairballs. It really does the job and my cats love it! I highly recommend it!
3,Kitty wouldn't have it..... but it works!,"Ok so this product does work. It does what it tells you it will. The amount of hair that came off my cat was awesome!! However, my cat will not let me use the tool on him. I had to keep doing little passes over him every few minutes but he wasn't enjoying it. Maybe it is too hard on his skin or maybe I needed a smaller size. I got the purple one... He prefers a nice soft boar bristle brush..... If your cat likes to walk or move around while you brush him, this won't work for you. If you can get your cat to lay there while you gently use the tool it will work! Good luck!"
5,Lovely Brush!,"I just received this brush the other day and I gotta say: I love it!It worked fabulously. I let the weight of the brush do all the work, just run the brush through the coat. I got enough fur to make a cat toy. At least that's what my cat thought it was!Both of my cats loved the brushing, purred and everything.Immensely happy with this purchase."
5,DE SHEDDER,"This tool helped me groom my senior cats. As the cats have gotten older, they are no longer able to groom themselves as well as when they were younger. I could brush them and remove the fur without tugging on the skin. They tolerated the deshedding!!"
5,Product made me leave my first review!,"I have a medium hair cat who doesn't shed all that much. I bought this product thinking I'll help remove some of that under coat. W-O-W! It removed so much fur I didn't know was ""hanging"" around. My cat also is in LOVE with the brush. It's like a treat to her when I brush her and I love to do so. This product truly does as it's supposed to. Her coat is now always sleek and shiny. I am buying more for my mother and one larger one for the dog! I can't get enough of this product! You won't be sorry."
2,"Uh, this one's tricky!","Wooo boy! I wasn't sure what to expect with this product, but it has turned out to be a little more time consuming and work intensive than I imagined it would be. Maybe it's just the temperament of my cats, but they didn't want to sit still for the brushing. This wouldn't be too bad, except that the tool is unwieldy and heavy. I also had to stop several times to clear the hair in order for it to be effective.The brushing surface isn't very wide so I couldn't cover but one small area at a time. So, between convincing my cats to cooperate, stopping to clear the hair from the tool, and the time it took to actually get used to the tool while brushing the whole cat, there was a definite learning curve!I will say this, though. It most certainly does remove hair that I had no idea could be removed and I easily had another cat's worth of hair when I was done! Uh, and use this tool outside!"
3,fussy cat,"well, the furminator seems good... unfortunately my cat can be very suspicious and one or two passes on his back is all i can manage. i've only tried 3 times, since i'm sharing it with my friend. maybe next time i'll try post catnip."
4,Like the energizer - just keeps going...,"It is amazing how much hair this thing cat pull off of a cat. Keep in mind though, that it takes a LOT of brushing to get the job done. It is not a quick job and you are done."
4,Link Cats Review Furminator,"The Furminator pretty much functions as advertised. It's more useful for long-haired than short-haired cats, and probably would have worked wonderfully on my old Scottish Fold, Pugsley, who had a thick wooly undercoat that matted terribly. The comb somehow pulls out the ultra-long underfur on my domestic long hair and works really well on fluffy tails. The only thing I don't care for is the weight, which makes it easy to apply too much pressure to the cat while combing."
2,FURminator maybe not worth it,Product definitely got hair but it was almost like thinning your hair. Not like combing it out. It seems to me that a good bath and brushing worked better for my four himalayians. it was ok but not worth the money.
3,The Dog's Furminator Works As Well,"Have the large furminator for our golden and retriever which works great. Was using on the 7.5# cat! So I thought it would be a good idea to purchase a smaller style made for felines. I frankly accomplish what I need to do with the larger tool, and didn't need to spend the money on another. I don't think it works with the same ease or gives quite the same results. Perhaps it is what I am used to; whatever, my cat loves to be furminated with either."
3,Furminator not right for my cats,Furminator is very heavy and rough on my cats who are 2 years old and weigh about 7lbs each. When using I have to be very careful while combing as it takes out chunks of hair if I am not careful.
5,just a plain metal brush.... but it works GREAT!!,"no batteries, no electricity... just a plain old metal brush on a strong plastic handle.... short little brushes through my cats hair removed LOTS and LOTS of hair... cat looked better, felt better and was much happier.buy it here. pet stores sell for almost $50!!! crazy... dont pay more than $15.its great... i definitely recommend."
4,Great tool,"This comb rakes out the undercoat and generally makes your cats shed less, and works pretty much exactly as advertised. In a word of advice, make sure to either use the FURminator outside or when you're going to vacuum anyway since it produces a lot of hair, and if it's not cleaned up quickly, cats can become interested in it, which leads to hairballs. I've noticed that it's most efficient when used after my cats have dried out from a bath.Despite what other reviews may indicate, if your cat doesn't like being groomed with other brushes, they're probably not going to like being groomed with this one. Also, it may be a good idea to wear glasses or something else to keep the fur out of your eyes since small bits of it will invariably float up around you. But if you can deal with the minor annoyances, you'll be much better off for using this."
5,Gotta get it,"Some things are worth the money. This is one of them. I have 4 cats all w/ different hair textures. This comb works wonders on all of them from short hair to long hair, coarse to fine. Splurge and you'll not regret it."
5,Best Brush,"I own a long-haired cat and have tried many brushes and combs. My cat usually winces and tries to run no matter how careful I try to be. I came across the Furminator, was a little skeptical at first, but bought it based on the reviews and research. It is by far the best brush I've used. It takes off many times the amount of hair that the other brushes and combs do. My cat's wincing has also decreased."
5,Revolutionary Grooming Tool,"For all those who have already developed an irrevocable bond with their fur ball of a pet, this tool is for you. I preface my review that way because my two cats shed so much, I was becoming hopeless for a normal life - EVERYTHING in my apartment is covered in fur. This tool saved my life. The extremely fine toothed comb not only removes the loose fur on the surface of your pet's coat, but the fur from their undercoat as well, the fur that is going to fall out eventually. I was a little startled by its price but it is definitely a wise investment - the Furminator eliminates the need for any other grooming tool."
5,This is amazing !!!,"We have 2 indoor cats 1 is long haired the other short I was so tired of cleaning cat hair off of everything furniture,bedding I even had to carry lint rollers in the cars so when I went to work I didn't have pet hair on my clothes. The first time that I used it on our long haired cat you would of thought we completely shaved him and even more amazing was how much hair came off our short haired cat. I know I'm much happier now that I don't have to vacuum as soon as I walk in the house. I would recommend this product highly."
4,Does the job,The Furminator deshedding tool for cats does the job. We have two cats and they love being groomed with the furminator. It does an exceptional job on our long-haired cat and his coat is beautiful and shiny. Great price at Amazon.
5,Finally less hair!!!,I had someone recommend this product to me and it is amazing!!! This is by far the best deshedder ever...a must have.
5,Great de-shedder,My cat has long fur and sheds alot. The FURminator does a great job of thinning his coat and he actually likes to be brushed with it.
3,does what it does,"my rubber brush works as well on our cat. There are lots of tools for collecting extra hair, each cat is different. shipped fast"
2,Hard to use,This product is very hard to use. Plus my animals hate being combed with it. Also very hard to clean. Not my favourite tool. I don't use it very much.
4,"Good, but take awhile","The brush is very good and gets the deep layers of fur, but since it's so narrow it takes awhile for me to groom my cat. Granted, he's a very fat cat. Something for someone who really cares for their pets."
4,"I like it, my cats don't","This FURminator works great! The thing is, my cats won't let me use it on them. Two of my cats love to be brushed (the third can't be bothered) but no matter how gentle I am they won't stick around for the FURminator. But it really does work. Lots of excess hair in just a moment, and a moment is all I get. They do like the ZoomGroom (also available on Amazon) and it will get quite a bit of hair off of them. I've tried with the FURminator for about a month now and two or three swipes is all I get. Maybe if your cats are more laid back than mine they will go for it. Like I said, it really works."
3,cats not thrilled,"Although this brush really helps get rid of some fur none of my three cats liked it at all. One hates brushing of any kind, so her attitude can be dismissed, The other two only tolerated it for about 5 strokes before trying to escape. I didn't put excessive pressure and was gentle but no luck. If your cat will tolerate it, I'm sure it would work great judging by the amount of fur the 5 strokes removed. Maybe I just have picky cats."
3,doesn't yank because it has a blade,"I was a bit apprehensive about whether the FURminator would yank out the undercoat (some tight combs I've seen are very rough on cats) but it's very gentle. I was surprised to see it had a blade (I tested it on a few strands of my own hair) so, well, really than rather extracting the undercoat that is loosening this Spring, it just cuts it. Which is certainly better than my cat ingesting that hair otherwise.Hair goes EVERYWHERE when you use it, but I found that dipped the comb in a small cup of water before each set of strokes kept the static at bay and kept the hair bunched together on the comb.I seriously don't think that owners that have cats purring while they use this on the should worrying whether the cats are in pain... it's not yanking the hair out, just thinning it."
5,Coon Cat Fur is tamed!!,"This is great because it really gets the thick undercoat of my Maine Coon Cat. He is not a big fan of the brush and I had to distract him with food in order to get at him with this, but it was worth it! It got off more fur than his stickler brush and his coat is nice and shiny! He actually looks thinner...GREAT PRODUCT!"
4,Great product if your cat is mat-free,"This product really does remove some serious fur! You cannot use it on areas that are even slightly matted. It worked great on my persians, although they hate being brushed and didn't want to cooperate. If your cat is good when getting brushed, you will love this product!"
5,Furminator,The Furminator is the best thing I've ever found to keep pet hair under control. I no longer have cat hair all over the furniture. There is nothing that compares. I love it.
5,Great Product,"Received the product on time and it worked fantastic on my short haired cat. I was afraid she wouldn't let me do it but she didn't mind it at all. When finished, her coat looked clean and sleek as though she had a bath without the actual bath. Very happy with the product."
5,Awesom Furminator,I purchased the Furminator and received it in the mail in a timely manner. It works very well on my cat. He actually enjoys being brushed now. It does the job of eliminating all of the loose fur and keeps is coat looking great.
5,AMAZING at getting rid of excess fur,"I have 3 fluffy cats, and nothing has ever worked this well at getting at their undercoats. Every stroke fills the comb completely. Important to be careful of not over-brushing one spot, though. Your cat will probably let you know."
5,Works Wonders!,"The cat FURminator deShedding Tool is marvelous! I used it on a black short haired cat who left hair wherever he walked or laid down. In about 5 minutes I had deshedded him and had a giant pile of hair. Now whenever I pet him, he doesn't leave hair in my hand nor is there any hair where he lays or walks around. Great tool!FURminator deShedding Tool with 1-3/4-Inch Edge for Cats"
4,Where did all this hair come from?,I didn't know my cat had so much hair until we started using the FURminator on him. Its more like rake than a brush but it doesn't seem to irritate our kitty any more than his other brush.You will get fistfuls of hair off your fuzzy friend. Do this outside or somewhere that can be vacuumed easily.This is an amazing tool and amazon has it for an amazing price.
3,Should be cheaper for what it is!,I'm disapointed not in it's functionality but in what the product ACTUALLY IS... This is nothing more than a clipper blade (an Oster A5 blade to be specific) attached to a handle.I'm not knocking the product at all it works fine I just think the price is extreme when you finally know what it is... a rubberized handle and 1 side of a clipper blade.And the maker of the product has the bawlz to try to patent that? I do hope some one challenges that and makes a fairer priced version.
5,Cats Really Enjoy It,My little persian has really tender skin & I was really suprised she doesn't mind this even on little tiny knots.My cats also LOVE theCat Zoom Groomfor a daily massage.Really impressed with furminator have 3...the blue & the purple.
3,Good idea...but,I like this idea of a product. I groom our cats frequently so that they are used to this behavior but they just did not like this tool. It may just be their preference. I went and bought a stiff brisled brush and they seem happier with it than this product. The product DOES work and gets a majority of the hair out but the cats are not happy with it. I use it when the weather changes because it does appear to remove more hair than the brisle brush.
4,Pretty decent,"I've had this for a little while now, and it doesn't seem to take off nearly the amount of hair as seen in the few customer pictures, but I would say that it does take off much more hair than a regular cat brush or comb. But be prepared for hair to fly everywhere! I got this because I need to try to curb the amount of hair my oldest cat ingests from constant over-grooming, but I get the least hair off of her and wonder if her and my other cats just have extremely thin & wispy fur that's hard to remove? Fur seems to fly all over the place instead of being collected on the brush. Other than that, it's got a solid construction and is durable, and it does remove a bit more fur than the few other brushes I've tried."
5,Great Product,"Heard about this tool on a cat forum. So glad I did. Doesn't compare to her brush. I am amazed at how much undercoat hair comes out. She was having trouble with hairballs and I really have not seen one in weeks. She looks better too and her food is starting to make her coat nice and shiny. I pass it over her a couple times a week and there is always so much hair there. It's shocking. At first she would run around and I would have to follow her. She liked it but she was trying not to like it. You know, when no means yes. This is her. I still have to chase her with it until she gives in. So exhausting. But it is a great tool and does exactly what is says it does. Real happy about no more hair balls."
5,Best cat brush I've used!,"(Update: Updating my review as they now LOVE it!)I've had my short haired kittens for almost 2 months now, and they're 4 months and 6 months old. The first time I used this product, my cats HATED it, but after 2 more uses, my cats LOVE it. I have to hold them, but they purr like crazy when I brush them, and I get tons of fur off of them!Anyway, it works really well. The first time I used it I didn't get that much... But the next time... Oh my. I could have kept going for HOURS. I was actually afraid of overgrooming them! By the time I was done, I had a huge ball clumped together of cat hair and my black tshirt was covered in it, too. It is messy, so be sure to either not wear clothes or cover yourself up with something.Afterwards, they were super soft, and I wanted to pet them nonstop."
2,Not worth the money,difficult to use. Used it until the cat would'nt hold still anymore and did not notice any difference in shedding.
2,Overpriced,"I used the Furminator on two different cats - one with Maine Coon-like long hair and the other short. Notwithstanding that both cats equally despise this brush (but love their regular brush) it seems to work a lot better on the short hair. The LH cat, OTOH, it pulls out the tufts of hair that I wouldn't get with the regular brush, but the cat still walks around with poofs of her fur flying everywhere because the Furminator just doesn't grab the hair the way the regular brush does.I wasn't impressed with this product and was even less impressed with the obvious price gouging going on. It's just *not* worth the money because I see no discernible difference between this cutesy named product versus a regular wire brush."
1,false advertising,"This product has a razor like base and it doesn't deshed the fur, it actually cuts it, take a piece of dental floss and put it between the grates and pull, it cuts like a razor, BAD PRODUCT, don't waste your money, and on top of that, once you open the package you can't return it...so much for the retailer."
4,It is nice...,"I am a pet groomer. I like to keep my own personal pets well groomed as much as I can. I can assure you that this product works and is GREAT. BUT the cost is overpriced. All this tool is, is a part to a grooming clipper blade with a handle. The blade part is all you need. It costs much less then the FURminator tool. all you have to do is go to a pet store, purchase a 10 or surgical sized blade, remove the top part, keep the bottom and brush away. The person that created this had a great idea! They probably are making several thousand dollars on this item. But they could reduce the cost a bit. I love the idea, and I know it is great to have a handle on it for many people. But why spend twice the amount when you can make it for less? The clipper blades cost alot less if you know were to look."
3,Long hair Manx cat,"We have a 6-year-old long hair cat (we think she's a Manx). She loves being brushed. Previously, I used a cat brush that looks more like a metal bristle hair brush. The thing I like least about the FURminator is that it gets hair all over my clothes and in the air unlike my previous brush. It seems like it's meant to be paired with a hand mitt or something to catch all that hair. The thing that's great is the kitty still likes being brushed and it's easy to get the fur out."
3,I wish my cats liked it as much as I do,"This bad boy definitely works, don't get me wrong. The only major problem standing in the way of me and a hair-free wardrobe is that my two cats WILL NOT let me use it on them. I don't know what it is, they just don't seem to take well to being groomed by a brush. I can't imagine that this thing actually hurts them. I've tried creeping up on them when they're dead asleep to get a few stokes in but they immediately run away. And it's a shame because just ONE stroke of the brush gets up a ton of hair. One downside that I experienced was all the hair that would subsequently fly around after brushing, I felt like I got more hair on myself! Then again, I was also dealing with squirming cats. Alas, I will continue my attempts with this little gem in hopes that my cats will soon tire of me constantly following them around and taking swipes at their coats."
5,Works well!,"Nothing to add from other reviews: works well, well, well!Lots of hair removed in a few minutes, cat didn't mind. And she looked like she lost a few pounds right there...another kind of weight loss program."
5,Wonderful Deshedder,"This product worked wonders for my cats, and I have since passed it on to my friend, who also has two cats. It's 4/4 so far! It can seriously pull hair that, when bunched up, is half the size of the animal itself! I still see hair when I pet my cats, but you need to be realistic, it isn't magic, but you'll see how great it is with the first use (that's when you get the most hair).It does make a little bit of a mess, so be sure to have a vacuum and lint roller on hand!"
5,"Awesome, but use with care.","Like the title says, it's a great brush, but don't go overboard with it. Some under coat fur is there for a reason. Though make sure you have a lint roller near by because you'll be covered with cat hair. A little bit of water helps keep most of the hair from flying around the room."
5,Does what it says!,"I purchased both a dog and a cat FURminator when a friend, who has three cats, raved about it . She paid three times as much as what Amazon offered the same items for. I received the items in two days and my son's dog loves it. She even lets us comb her tail and she turns from side to side so we comb her thighs. My other son has the white cat in his townhouse and it has significantly reduced the shedding over his black decor! He also has allergies so getting rid of flying fur is an added plus. I highly recommend this product. It does what it illustrates and says."
5,Happy Cat...Happy Cat Mom,"My cat was shedding everywhere and a friend suggested a furminator. It's the best thing ever! It's easy to use and took literally buckets of fur off my cat. She looks leaner and shiny and is much more comfortable in the Arizona heat. The shedding around the house is almost eliminated and a bonus...my cat loves the furminator. She just lays down and lets me comb her. The vendor was great, because the price was much less than others and the shipping was fast."
5,Amazing deshedding tool!,"I used to own a Bamboo brand deshedding tool, and it worked well. However, my brother convinced me to upgrade to the FURminator and I'm glad I did! It works significantly better. It removes lots and lots of fur from my cat. I highly recommend this to any cat or dog owner who's pet sheds. It feels sturdily built, as well, so I expect it will last a long time."
5,Perfect for cats!,I had one of these that i paid twice as much for at a pet store and decided to get another one for the mother-in-law's cats. This thing works amazingly well compared to every other brush out there. It removes loose hairs while thinning the coat to prevent future shedding. You still have to use it every couple of weeks for the best effect(though I don't use it that often). It keeps the cats fur softer feeling as well whether young or old. Finally for the price on Amazon you cant go wrong as this is the exact same brand sold at large pet stores for $35 or more.
5,LOVE IT!!,"I just can't believe I waited so long to actually make this purchase! It does everything it claims, I have promoted it to everyone I know."
4,That's a lot of fur!!,"The first time we used the Furminator, I was amazed (even after watching the video) at how much fur came off our cat. It was right about the time his coat was changing from summer to winter to he was really shedding. Now once a week or so seems to be about the right fit. The cat doesn't exactly love it, like so many other reviewers have indicated, but he tolerates it."
3,Doesn't work like the demo video,"Perhaps I got the wrong size for my 11 year-old Siamese cat. It does remove more fur than the regular brush, but not the quantity shown in the video. I even used the brush for a few weeks and tried it in several ways to determine the best technique - still can't duplicate the performance in the video."
3,Works great... if only i could use it on my cat,"I have a cat that sheds more than ANY other cat i have come across. I thought this would be the solution to ALL of life's problems. Great product really takes off the excess hair. Only problem is my cat absolutely hates it. I should point out though that she HATES all brushes, just this one she runs away at the sight of the brush. I don't know if its because I was more persistent in my brushing when i got this product, or if its the brush in particular. Nonetheless I don't really use it since I bought it. It's a 3 because it works, but not a 5 because I can't use it."
4,good comb for cat fur,It's an overall good comb for cat fur. It's great for loose fur but it doesn't cut through the clumps as well as another comb I have.
3,grooming tool,"I thought this would be an added benefit to grooming my cats, but it doesn't seem to remove as much fur as I hoped it would. Also, they seem to prefer that I use a comb on them."
4,Must have for long haired cats,Daily grooming of long haired cats is a must to avoid knotted tangles. This well balanced comfortable grip tool makes the task easy on the owner & a pleasure for the cat. Even after vigorous brushing the FURminator still finds more undercoat to remove. It IS a little pricey (Amazon has by far the best price) but you will not regret the outlay.
4,leaves some astray,"I think the overall quality of this product is wonderful. Although, maybe I should have gotten a bigger one for my kitten. He's a short hair cat but it still doesn't collect it all, sometimes it yanks the hair but doesn't pick it up so I'm left with loose hairs all over, and the brush isn't even full of hair yet..."
3,"Takes out lots of fur, cat still sheds","As advertised in the picture, this comb takes out mounds of fur. My cat gets squirmy after several strokes but the comb still produces handfuls. However, my cat, a short hair, still sheds! I don't know how she's not bald yet. I can't say that I see much reduction in shedding. I'm really disappointed. I'm even more disappointed that I bought this thing at Petco before I checked out Amazon because I paid close to $40 on it."
3,You've been Furminated!,I think this product take a few tries.I got it in the winter.. and it didn't pick up much hair. And I was convinced it was another bum cat product.But come spring time it started removing lots and lots of hair from my cats. (Maybe my technique has gotten better.. not to mention it is shedding season..)It definitely picks up more then your average comb or brush.I would recommend it.
5,Cat Loves it,"All I can say is that my Cat loves to be brushed with it and it gets out the fur. It seems a bit like razor blades, but its safe to touch and does not pull the fur. Very heavy duty design. -Joshua"
4,Great brush! My only minor con is the price.,"I would definitely recommend the FURminator. It works and delivers as promised. Compared to the brush I was using before there was no comparison. I would barely get any hair off my cat with the old one, with the FURminator I was able to get a whole shopping bag's worth of hair off my cat.My cat seemed to like it a little at first, but he got a little restless after a while. My cat is a little jumpy to begin with so I would expect calmer cats won't be bothered by it much.My only minor complaint about this product is that it's a little pricey considering it's basically a metal fine toothed comb attached to a soft grip plastic handle. Cheap materials, I think it should be at least 5-10 dollars cheaper easily."
5,Amazing!,"The Furminator is amazing! Every other brush I have ever bought for my cat has been close to useless. Not the Furminator. When I used this on my two cats, they looked like they had gotten a haircut afterwards. I could pet them again without having loose hair fall off of them. Every pet owner should have a Furminator. Just beware of the massive amounts of fur that will come off of your pet; be ready to jump in the shower after you're done using this thing."
2,Too painful! My cat won't let me brush him...,"I was really excited about this brush but my cat freaks out every time I approach him with it. At first he would let me brush him a little, but with each use he got more and more upset. It really seems to ""pull"" his fur out, which can leave him looking groomed, at least the parts I can get to before he starts clawing the heck out of me! He has never responded to brushing like this before and it is obviously painful, no matter how gentle I try to be. I am returning it."
2,Not for my kitties,"I was very excited to get one of these since the reviews were pretty good. I have two cats, a Birman which has a very, very fine medium length fur and a non-breed short hair who has fine fur.I knew that the comb would be a bit heavy as opposed to a regular comb or brush but it is sort of uncomfortable using it on a small animal such as an 8 and 13 pound cat. It worked okay on the short hair but when I used it on the Birman the fur flies everywhere with each and every stroke! I also noticed that it actually cuts the fur shorter rather than remove the undercoat so I stopped using it."
5,Cat Heaven,"Our kitty WILL sit still for this as long as I can manage. After about 20 minutes of straight brushing, I have to shoo her away because my arm can't go anymore.This brush really works, and she throughly enjoys brushing time! It's amazing how you can brush the same 3 by 3 square inch and come up with hair everytime. She loves it so much, she would probably let me brush her until she was bald."
2,Furminator,It is ok. The price is way too high for the performance it provides. I would not recommend it to anyone.
3,"Works like a real Furminator, but is definitely not a real one.","Nothing removes the loose fur better then a furminator, and this works like one, but it's a Chinese knock off and I'm guilty for chasing the low price. Still this low price seems more justifiable than paying $40-$50 for the real thing."
3,Lots of caveats not visible until package is opened,"Purchased this for my 92 year old mother to use on her cats. She hasn't even tried it because she's afraid she'll injure them based on all of the warnings inside the packaging. Can't use it if the hair is tangled, pets may suffer brush burns even with gentle use. We wanted to return it but, as with all plastic packaging, it was impossible to get the item out without damaging the package. Might work well but would like to have seen some of the warnings before opening the package."
2,Didn't work for me,I bought this after reading the other reviews. I had high expectations. But truthfully I seem to gather more hair all over my fingers and face by just petting my cat than by using this product. I'm going to just buy a brush ...
2,Works ok.... not nearly as much hair as you see in pictures,"It works alright. But my cats don't seem to like it too much, even though I am being very careful to be gentle with it and not hurt them. They purr, but then they kinda squirm to get away as well.The main reason I am giving it a lower rating is that the pictures are WAY misleading. You do not typically get anywhere near that much fur shedded. And if you did, your cat would probably hate you.Disclaimer: this could just be because my cat is a medium-haired cat.... maybe it works better with long-haired cats. However, I thought this product was acceptable, but just mediocre. Nothing to go crazy about..(Mostly, the pictures of all that fur are misleading.)"
4,pricey but it works,"I debated for quite awhile before buying this because of the price but finally decided to try it. It really does an amazing job of removing fur, much much more than any other brush I've tried. I can't say if it really cuts down on shedding as much as it claims as I haven't owned it long enough to know at this point. I gave it 4 stars only because I feel it is overpriced, but it is a wonderful product."
2,Furminator cat-comb,"I have two cats - one who is very particular about how he's held and petted, and the other who doesn't care how he's held, as long as he's being petted. Of course the particular one didn't like this brush, which was not a surprise, even though many of the reviews I saw indicated that the animals ""loved"" this brush. The real surprise was the ""non-particular"" cat, who also didn't like being combed with this product, even though he'll let me hold him upside-down as long as I'm petting him. But he got up and walked away from this brush."
1,Furminator deshedding tool that DOES NOT work!,I purchased the Furminator De-shedding Tool for my Cat Sailor few weeks ago. I heard allot of great things about it so we went along with getting one and to my surprise the tool is an absolute waste of money. Don't be fooled into buying one of these like I was it does not work like they claim it does!Ryan
3,"Effective, but deceptive.","My boyfriend tried to shave his face with this on accident. That'll teach him to borrow my razor. Upside: he no longer sheds all over my apartment, which is good, since my cat Klaus is allergic."
1,Do you want a bald cat?,"I bought this brush after several family members raved about it. I have a long haired cat who loves to be brushed. I was brushing her last night (like I would regularly do) and the brushing left a large bald spot on her back. She purred the entire time, so I know she was not in pain. I am horrified that a product made for cats would be this harsh. No wonder it's called a ""deShedding Tool"" - she can't shed if she has no fur! I would not recommend this product unless you want a bald pet!"
5,Great!,This works wonderfully on my cats. It removes a lot of fur and I don't have to kill my fingers trying to remove the discarded fur from the deshedder.
3,Work but too well,"First, I have three cats and this only works well one one of them. The cat it works on has a heavier, coarse coat. The others have softer, longer coats.The product works well but if over used it can cause bald spots. This is what happened with me. I liked it, I used it and then found bald spots.I know use it every month once and then switch to my traditional tool. (Slicker brush)."
3,Great product just be careful!,"I have this product for my cat. He has normal cat fur. not long, and only semi thick. Like mink fur. It does take our mounds of hair...But it can go to far.Cat's inner coat is like the fleace in a rain jacket. It keeps them warm! I brushed my cat for 2 min in the same spot, and saw all the hair, but when I looked at the coat compared to the non brushed side I was shocked! The inner hairs where all gone and left with only gard hairs! IE same as just a plain plastic raincoat! Brrrrr! Now he doesn't want to go outside (outdoor indoor) even though our climate is mild. He notices the diffrence when this last winter he was A-OK with the 2 feet of snow. I'm glad it grows back, but don't spend to much time in the same area!I'm not using mine again! Poor kitty. He looks thinner and his coat is way less shiny than it use to be. I'm ok with a little bit of cat hair. Just let it fall out naturally. It releases oils for thier coat when it does."
4,Furballs 101,"Well, like a lot of other people, I was doubtful that this would actually help with the ""fur situation"". We have 2 cats and everything is covered!! I have been pleasantly surprised at how well the Furminator really works. Now, I just have to remember to use it on a regular basis."
5,Must Have for Cats -- Your Cat Will Thank You,"Great tool. Ozzy the Cat has a double coat and sheds year-round. This is the first time I have been able to properly groom this cat! And he did not object, as he has with other items purchased in the past. Highly recommended and worth the price."
5,Wow!,"I know you're thinking that this product is a little expensive and it is. But it's worth it. I've used this on two cats and also a dog. The amount of fur that it removes is amazing. I no longer have to de-fur my black pants, sofa, etc. This removes all that undercoat that mats on dogs and my cats only hack up a fur ball every now and then. One cat loves to be combed and the other tolerates it but then she barely tolerates anyone. Mister Dog looks and feels so soft and silky when he's been combed. Unless you have a really big dog, this size furminator will work fine for both small and medium dogs. I'll never use anything else again."
5,I love the Furminator!,"I love the FURminator! My cat has major problems with hairballs, and this tool is unbelievable. For years, I was using a regular comb and now I realize that I wasn't getting any hair off of her. The first time I used it on her, I could not believe the pile of hair. Now I notice that when I pet her, there isn't any loose hair coming off, and the hairballs aren't as bad. I would recommend this to anyone that has a dog or cat, it is the greatest invention ever!"
5,Better than anything,"Yes, ANYTHING! It doesn't seem like much when you look at it, but it digs deep and makes the fur fly (since you should be doing this outside in a breeze if you want to live). This is the first time I've EVER stopped getting hair out of my cat instead of hopelessly brushing on and on like an idiot."
2,bent and broken,While the FURminator is unparalleled in it's ability to pull cat hair out of my cat it works only so good when there are broken teeth in the comb and the teeth are bent over. If it were not for these defects the product and order process was flawless.
5,Best tool around!,"This was the best tool they ever invented! Our cat loved being brushed, and it definately removed all the shedding fur from our longhair. Well worth the money, even though I feel it is priced too high, it is well made. I'd spend the money on this item again, and not waste it on others. This works great!"
4,furry beast,The FURminator deShedding Tool is wonderful for my long haired calico. She loves being brushed & combed and now enjoys being sheared of her excess fur.
3,It is good though not great,"I like the product and read a ton of reviews on this so I had to get it. The two cats we have have mixed reviews. One of them likes it for a few minutes then I must stop, while the other one won't have anything to do with it. I also kept hearing some of the hair ""rip"" out instead of ""comb"" out, so maybe that is why the cat doesn't like it. It doesn't stop the shedding but it does clean them up a little bit.So I would say it is good, not perfect, but what is...Would I buy it again, maybe...but I haven't found a comb that they truly like and gets a lot of hair trimmed; therefore I gave it 3 stars."
5,The best yet,This is a product that works stellar. My cat tolerates it better than any other type of brush or slicker and it gets so much more fur out in less time. It is precision machined and the surprising weight of the product helps it to work.
2,Was not impressed,"After reading all the reviews, I thought this would be the savior. Unfortunately, it was not wide enough nor did it really grab the hair all that well."
3,Cat Doesn't Like it,I feel like it is hurting my persian's skin. She really doesn't like when I use it. THe comb I have works better
2,Not worth it,"This is no better than a brush you can buy for ~$7 at a regular store. Don't waste your money. It works, but there's nothing extraordinary about it."
5,Furminator is great,"My cats love when I use the Furminator on them. They think it is something special just for them, but eliminating so much fur I don't have the shedding problem I used to have."
1,Absolute Rubbish! Do not buy.,"Despite what the Product Details state, both movies are in Full Screen only, what a waste. (Unless you like Full Screen, then you're welcome to it). These movies have a solid audience, why can't Warner Bros. realise this and put out a decent version on DVD? The movies on this disc don't look much better than the ones I taped off television... a decade ago. I would send mine back, but I'd already opened it before I discovered what a ripoof this was. Had the Format been accurately stated, I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. Very disappointing."
1,A FULL SCREEN rip-off,There's no excuse for these two films to be full screen only. Even at under $10 bucks it's a major rip-off. A resounding boooooooo to Warner Bros. for this botched double-feature.
1,POINTLESS,FULL SCREEN?? Upon waiting and waiting for rerelease of The Road Warrior only to find it an even lesser format is quite a disappointment. Especially having paid for something I would have never wasted the money on if not being MISLED by the product information.I can only hope someday Warner Bros. will do justice with a decent DVD release of the only worthy & brilliant follow up to Mad Max.
1,Get the Blu Ray of The Road Warrior instead!!!,"This is a real shame,sure it contains both Road Warrior and its sequel Thunderdome but they are FULL SCREEN VERSIONS,the beautiful camera work cant be enjoyed to the fullest,if it were 1.85 films that might have been somewhat accepable,but these were filmed in 2.35,so you loose allmost 50% of the picture,it;s like getting half a movie!!! Would have been great if they were widescreen transfers,but no such luck here,if you got a Blu Ray player,than get the Road Warrior in that format,heck the price is not much higher than this one!!! Like I said go Blu!!!"
4,Great action and adventure,"Mel Gibson when he was fresh and new to the public. What a great intoduction to the world, humor and action combined."
3,Not quite...,"My son received this double- feature as a Christmas gift. The quality of the movies are adequate, but there is no Title Menu or Scene Selection. It just starts playing the movies one after the other. Was this taped off of HBO or something?"
3,Preliminary Review,"Although I loved and still love post-apocalyptic stories, I didn't like ""The Road Warrior"" when I first saw it, but now, as a relic of it's time, I think it holds up remarkably well. It's cool and weird - silly, in a good way. Eventually, I will replace this 2007, full screen release version with a better, widescreen copy.I remember the critics, way back then, trashing ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" for it's storytelling shortcomings. They were right. This movie looks great and has some spectacular action scenes, but I can't comprehend why THIS script got O.K.'d for shooting. Well, no doubt it had everything to do with the expected box office returns. This is a perfect example of ""big budget crap.""After I re-watch the original ""Mad Max,"" I'll probably revise this review.Luv and peace."
3,Alright,"Mel Gibson does a decent job, but the other actors don't quite match up. These two movies are not nearly as good as the first Mad Max."
4,Talented author,"""Talented author Lisa Tucker brings the story of Patty, a single mother raising a young child on the road. After her first love and father of her child was sent away to prison, Patty tries to rebuild her life working as a singer in a band, and raise her young son. Tucker's words are true, spot on and never patronizing as she takes us through Patty's struggles with her alcoholic mother, difficult band members, possessive ex-lover while trying to build a life for herself. Patty comes across as a true and honest heroine, who tries hard to be and do the best she can while struggling with doubts, feelings and responsibilities.I highly recommend this book."""
4,"Great Story, Likeable Heroine","Shout Down the Moon is a compellingly readable novel, one which has you rooting for Patty, the charming protagonist and first-person narrator from the very first page. Patty has had a difficult life, her father died young, her abusive mother is an alcholic, her dangerous ex-boyfriend, and father of her child, just got out of prison and she has a difficult job. The boyfriend wants her back, but her co-workers and her mother don't really want her, for various reasons. Patty also struggles with her choice of career, lead singer in a small band doing pop song covers. Most of the other members of the band would rather be playing jazz, but Patty wants whatever puts food on the table, which she thinks is pop and not jazz. For all her difficulties, Patty is a charming narrator--her story keeps you reading. The resolution of the novel is a bit predictable, but that's my only complaint about this engaging novel."
3,Sad,"I think Lisa Tucker did a great job with the book and made it very easy to read. It took a troubled girl with a bad upbringing to come to terms what really matters in life, her child. I guess it was just the seedy lifestyle she lived as well as her Ex-Husband that I did not love. The book is well written and will keep you reading it just wasn't one of my favorites."
3,An easy read,"Shout at the Moon was a nice, easy read. It had just enough to keep me reading to the end.The ending was too much over the top drama.The book wasn't horrible, but not one I would recommend."
2,Lacking.,"This book is definitley a page turner, I finished it in a few hours, but didn't think it was all that great. Some/most of the other reviewers are completely overrating this book. I thought that characters had depth, and were somewhat intriguing, but the plot had holes, the climax was poorly described, so I felt like---is this it? The resultion was poorly done, I felt very unconntected with the character by the end of the book. I would not recommend this book to others."
3,Should have researched kids,"While I found this an engaging book, three year old Willie is simply too unusual to be true. Each time I settled into the story, this superchild would dress himself in overalls or remember details from the past or make observations a three year old simply isn't capable of. Maybe it's just me, but those inaccuracies made this book less enjoyable than it might have been otherwise."
4,Wonderful story!,"Like The Song Reader, this tale revolves around music (my other passion in life). Patty is a singer touring with a band that looks at her as a meal ticket...and someone who is not serious about music. Patty also has a toddler son, Willie, whose father has just been released from prison and is on parole. He is determined to have Patty and Willie at any cost.Lisa Tucker continues to create marvelously complex relationships, unique characters and lyrical words. I can hardly wait for her next book....but, from what I understand, it will be 2005 before I get to read another."

5,Only thing that works for me,I initially started using this when I was nursing my now 3 1/2 year old and did not want to take an antihistamine for fear my milk would dry up. My seasonal allergies were so bad I could not just suffer through it so at my sister's urging I gave Hyland's Hayfever a try. Awesome stuff! Last year I tried Claritin because I thought it would be great if I only had to take something once every 24 hours rather than every 4 but it didn't work for me so I went back to Hyland's. I am now expecting again and am glad it works so well because I wouldn't feel comfortable taking anything else while pregnant and I have horrible seasonal allergies.
5,Worked great for me,"I had a hayfever attack at my parent's house and I took some allergy medication. However, it takes a long time to work. My mom gave me this while I waited for the medication to work -and within a few minutes, my throat stopped itching, my sneezing stopped - it worked very quickly! Highly recommend it."
1,"It's not a CD, and no Certificate of Authenticity.","Instead of receiving a CD, I received several 3 1/2"" floppy disks.And no Certificate of Authenticity."
1,Only for certain computers,"I was under the impression that this was a Windows 95 disk for ANY computer. Unless you happen to have whatever computer this was original equipment for, it is useless."
5,The Clouds!!,"Those peaceful clouds remind me of the skys over my native Bonearth. It reminds me of my youth, sitting on the hills, and singing along to the anthem."
1,Amazon sent this as a Recommendaton,"Amazon sent a recommendaton for this in email. I'm blown away by the fact that Amazon would recommend this product, much less based on MY purchases. It is obsolete. It is so obsolete it can't be used on any modern or even recent computer system. It has no place, other than historical amusement and Amazon is recommending this to customers in 2012?This would be like a modern doctor recommending bleeding by leaches. Shame on Amazon."
5,Compatibility with Ultima?,I have enjoyed playing Ultima 7 for a long time now and wonder if this is compatible with Ultima 7. I have heard there are issues and I might go with Mac System 7 instead.I heard this version will work in every country but Cuba.
2,Not satisfied,The product ID was not legit per the computer I have and I agree with a previous review. Unless you have the original equipment it won't work at least for trying to restore a computer.
4,A heart-warming film,"Now, I don't know anything about the original 1940's edition, but the acting seemed quite suitable and characters seemed fairly honest. All in all, not a bad film."
2,Terrible!,"I was very excited when LITTLE MEN came out, but my excitment soon changed to dismay. This beloved classic was minpulated horribly. The acting is terrible and the portrayls of the characters are horrible. All in all a terrible movie."
2,Doesn't Pass,"I can't recommend this film. If you are expecting a continuation of ""Little Women"", you won't find it here. We learn nothing of Marmie, Laruie, etc. The movie focuses on ONE boy character (a 14 year old orphan from Boston) and all the mischief he gets into. How he hurts the other boys, burns down the house, plays with knives, etc. The ending is major cheese and Mariel Hemmingway as Joe? No. The film doesn't explore her relationship with her husband (German professor, what's his name). Was this film made for TV? Its of an average TV movie quality. On the other hand, it has no sex, language, etc. So if you are looking for something to watch with your 10 year olds, you might give it a whirl."
5,Great movie!,"This movie is a great movie for people of all ages. It makes you think about everything that you benefit. It was so sweet when Dan sang at the end. It made me fall into tears. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes humor, and touching stories."
3,A Bit of Fun.,"This is a movie to either enrage or amuse Catholics although there is little Catholicism in it other than the use of nun outfits (sort of) and a poke or two at some Catholic icons, notably the Pope. The song and dance routine by Jesus and his interaction with the nuns (they are after all his wives) provide the most humor. There is not really any sort of a plot in this movie, just a send-up of religion in general and those sexy(?) nuns in particular. Not everyone's cup of tea, but then, what is?"
2,Excellent with a noticeable omission,"I liked this book and how it traced Lee's research into the straight lead. Yet the crucial mistake Teri Tom makes is not posting a video of her performing the straight lead or including some kind of cd-rom. Pictures of her doing each step of the straight lead is all well and good, but her timing, her speed, and so much more do not show up in static pictures. If she is really interested in preserving Bruce Lee's life work, she should release a seminar video for sale. Not everyone can trek down to CA to see her do a seminar."
1,Oversimplistic Diatribe,"This book is a great dissapointment. If this were your only exposure to JKD, you might think the entire fighting sytle consisted of trying to sucker punch your opponent. Tom's opinions on other JKD styles, and Wing Chun is disparaging and at times fraught with a lack of understanding bordering on ignorance. The political motivations behind Tom's work seem to revolve more around mud-slinging and selling her new book/issues of 'Black Belt"" magazine than teaching the best that she can."
2,Disappointed with what I hoped to be an excellent read.,"When I saw that Teri Tom had written an entire book on one punch I had to get it. I was looking forward to what was sure to be a thoroughly researched, thoughtful book. I was quickly and frequently disappointed. Frustrated was more like it. Many of Tom's explanations were wrong. Those errors involved physics and anatomy. I also had the impression that she was trying to prove a point about Bruce Lee. I think the book would have come across as more professional and objective if Tom had stuck to the technique and avoided the politics.Teri did do a good job explaining how to perform the punch. Her physics and anatomical errors have no effect on her explanations on how to correctly perform the straight lead. The errors were about why the punch is effective. If that won't frustrate you, go ahead and get the book, it does illustrate the punch well."
2,Can't take it seriously,"There are a number of pictures in this text that show Ms. Tom giving a ""proper"" execution of the straight lead in which her waist is over-rotated and her leading shoulder is over-extended. To put it simply, if she really punched at a serious opponent like that, she'd be thrown or put into a joint lock so fast she wouldn't know what hit her. God help her if she ever fights a Xing-Yi or Wing Tsun stylist - they'd blast through her lead without a second thought.Accompanying pictures of Ted Wong in the text reveal Tom's straight lead to be improperly executed (which can be confirmed by finding pictures of Bruce Lee himself demonstrating the straight lead).To be fair, the amount of information in this book is pretty well-written and is balanced with some decent drills and advice. However, I find it very hard to take this book seriously, since the author is obviously executing the move at the heart of her thesis incorrectly."
1,Turning JKD into a cult...,"Ted Wong is not Bruce Lee. His student is trying to perform Bruce Lee's system without Bruce Lee's physical attributes. Trying to use Bruce's personal system, unchanged from the 60's, in today's environment is not going to be effective. It's amusing to note that Bruce Lee was constantly revising his training to be more effective and efficient, yet some people want to take a snapshot of his development at the point where he died, and then never change it again. Can anyone seriously believe that he had finished developing the system? There is no telling what JKD would look like today if Bruce had not tragically died so young.Also, the author's backhanded reference to Dan Inosanto in a negative light hints at an agenda, especially since he has been instrumental in promoting Bruce Lee's system and philosophy for over 30 years."
5,Great book on JKD and Boxing,This has to be the only book ever written on just one punch (well it doesn't just include one punch but still). This book is very scientific in it's approach and the principles it teaches are usefull not just for JKD practioners but also the Boxers.It's like this books goes into the details that the Tao of JKD just skimmed over so it's a great book on the Ted Wong style (which some says is the truest to the original) of JKD.
2,Please Don't Fuss Over It,I love dissecting punching physics. A book that would lead me to my own exploration of that would be a wonderful thing. Or; any teacher that would want me to make my own exploration of martial arts and stay away from politics would probably be what I need.Need I say more ?
1,What's the fuss about? It's just a basic punch!,"Almost 200 pages dedicated to one punch? It's nothing more than a lead jab! There's nothing mystical about it and it can easily be defended by parrying and retreating or sidestepping and countering with kicks, punches or a takedown! What's the big deal? What is Ms. Tom going to write next, a 200 page book about the right cross? This book could have easily been written in ten pages. Give me a break!"
5,The straight punch: core of Jeet Kune Do,"The straight punch is the core of Jeet Kune Do, and a key elements in Bruce Lee's own style: he once described it as the most difficult move of Jeet Kune Do, yet few other martial arts titles focus on it alone. Here's a history of the straight punch in Western martial arts, showing Lee's technique and providing step-by-step black and white photos. From how to redirect forces downwards to staying straight, THE STRAIGHT LEAD is filled with excellent, specific movement tips."
3,"for therapists, not parents","Great information, but this book is probably more geared towards Occupational therapists etc. Although I am a pharmacist, it's probably too much technical information for me as a Mom. I would probably recommend ""The Out of Sync Child"" instead."
2,"Cool, for the first 3 days","I LOVED ninja turtles around when they FIRST came out (not theese new ones, the ORIGINAL ONES) So I decided to get theese figures. Don was the first I picked up. I REALLY REALLY liked him so I got this one. I liked to make them fight and stuff. They were one of my favorite toys but after a week they got put in my closet, and now I have better figures like Xevoz. O well, they are good for the fist week."
4,"Awesome Toy, but Sais can bend",In my opinion the Sais were more sturdy with this Raph:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th Anniversary Action Figure RaphaelPlus the Sais holding spot 'should have been' on the front instead of the sides. Other then that this is a great improvement from the 25th Anniversary Raph.
3,USE WITH SOME CAUTION,"My area of expertise is coastal Oregon and the roads connecting it to I-5. I have tried traveling roads marked paved on these pages and found them to be only overgrown trails. Before heading very far off pavement or into mountainous areas, check with other sources (preferably local as you go) regarding the roads you have chosen. The graphics are great, but I keep the ""other map book"" on hand with this one to cross-reference, and occasionally make a call to the local Forest Service office to learn current road condition. I look forward to the revised edition and have been keeping notes of corrections I'd like to see."
5,Seamless,"There are two very different elements incorporated into this documentary: Louis Tiant's history, and a current day visit back to Cuba for his first time since he left during the revolution. I probably shouldn't mention these distinct parts because they are interwoven so seamlessly in the documentary that they form one coherent whole. They tell a tight story of a man who is separated from his family for most of his life, of two nations providing distinct opportunities, and of a son who emulates his father's pitching success in many ways but with completely different financial results. Maybe you think you know the story, but you don't. Trust me, there are surprises. The end is so beautiful, it hurts. How amazing is it to watch a director transcend both the sports documentary and biopic traps? You might imagine that if you don't care about baseball or Cuba that this is not a film for you. I believe if you care about people, you will like it."
4,an important baseball legend's journey,"I had heard about this documentary being developed for a couple of years and I'm glad it finally was released in DVD.......this is a must buy for any serious baseball film buff or historian.Without question, Tiant is the stuff baseball legends are made of, it is lesson in American/Cuban relations for the younger generation, but mostly it is the epic emotional journey of Luis Tiant's return visit to Cuba after his baseball career was over. Trying to reconnect with surviving family members and friends after decades of separation was heartwrenching.The story within the story about how Fidel Castro grants Tiant's parents permission to go to the US to see their son play ball is fascinating. The sacrifices endured by both Tiant and his parents so that he could live out his dream of playing baseball are incredible."
1,CUIDADO! Lea cuidadosamente el anuncio,"Cuando yo compre, la descripcion del producto decia ""SEASTAR HK6400 STEERING KITS WITHOUT HOSES THE ULTIMATE STEERING SYSTEM FOR HIGH SPEED SINGLE OUTBOARDS"", y despues de comprarlo me llego el juego de mangueras y ningun Kit HK6400.Yo le reclame al proveedor y este me indico que en anuncio tenia mal la descripcion y que les devolviera el producto. Ahora yo estoy en Venezuela y me cuesta mucho dinero retornar el producto y no tengo mi kit HK6400.QUE IRRESPONSABILIDAD!!!"
3,kind of disappointing,"Maybe I'm out-growing erotica? There was something missing from the stories, that wasn't coming across. Excuse the punz."
2,Not so great,"Galland did his best to take any possible blame for the defeat oF Germany out of his shoulders. That's why he wrote this book. He blames averyone and everything for the fall of ther Luftwaffe Fighter Arm, except himself, the leader of the aforementioned force. Very clever."
1,GARBAGE,I have never been so disgusted with a product in my life. I could only hope that Onkyo goes bankrupt due to the most unbelievably poor customer support they have given for this boat anchor. I will absolutely NEVER buy another Onkyo product and will do everything in my power to ensure that I spread this to every person possible. It is painfully obvious that Onkyo is aware that this thing is junk and should have recalled every one made and given any sucker who bought one 100% of there money back. I would have given this thing 0 starts if I could.
1,Total piece of crap,This thing is junk and Onkyo refuses to give any support. Do not buy this product or any other Onkyo product.
4,The dream of a Tribute lover,"Many people hate tribute records. Many people like them. I am one of the later. I accept that they are often made in a careless way, looking like the artist involved didn't care too much for something they are doing free. This is not the case here. Almost all the covers are taken very seriously, with love. After all those are the songs that really got a lot of people into music. And we are talking about some heavyweigths here: Sonic Youth (alma mater of the project), Mudhoney, Yo la Tengo..."
2,a bit Boring!,"I bought this book thinking it'll have lots of cool information about one of my previous favorite shows but when I read it, I saw that most of the stuff inside was what other people think about Lizzie McGuire and it had that same old advice on popularity, friends, family and bullying. So as you could guess it was really boring and I never even finished it! If you need some advice try some other better book. I still rated this book 2 stars though because some people might find the information in it interesting..."
1,What were the producers thinking?,"When I first heard the song Drift Away on the radio, I thought it was a joke song by Lanai and Augie. The backing track included bombs dropping, sheets of metal being shaken, monkeys caw-cawing and more. I can't make this up. Bombs and monkeys. If that's your idea of ""innovative"", then this song is for you. To me, it was more like performance comedy, unintentional as it was.I was embarassed for the artists after hearing this song. And then to find out that one of the Cruz brothers was on vocals! I was floored. That couldn't be right, could it? Guy Cruz is the man! Well, that's the state of Hawaiian music at the moment. Great talent, crap production, and recycled songs.No wonder IZ continues to dominate."
2,Not as good as the Bride Hunt,"Margo Maguire's the Bride Hunt is one of my favorite books, so I wanted to read this book as it picks up on what happens to Isabel's sister Kathryn. I have to say that the pace and writing were dissapointing. The two lead characters were not very interesting, in fact the one person who stood out most was the wife who passes away in the beginning. Her story may have been a better one to tell!"
4,Useful,"The tutorial works reasonably well, but would have been more useful if a ""help"" function had been included. Scrolling through the table of contents was a bit clumsy. Overall, however it contained thorough coverage of the software."
5,the're back!!!!,"The alligtor couple, Mr and Mrs Green are back in More Mr and Mrs Green and they are ready for 3 new adventures. First off it?s timefor fishing! Mr. Green shares his secret for catching the most fish. He uses jelly beans for bait! Then Mrs. Green shares with us her love of art. She paints a portrait of Mr Green and it turns out very unique. Last they go off for a lovely day in the park. Join them as they race for the ice cream truck!My family enjoyed the bright illustrations. We have red the first book in the series and were excited to see what The Greens were going to be up to in this second installment.The book is great for readers who are just starting to enjoy chapter books. The chapters are very short giving young reader the boost of confidence they need to enjoy reading."
1,Rip off,"You think you're going to get a paperback book and a large poster, but you receive a pamphlet and a smallish poster. Not worth almost ten dollars, that's for sure."
1,Disappointing and misleading,"We bought this for our library collection... and there is nothing in the description to show that this is a flimsy paperback ""guide"" (glued to a piece of cardboard that cannot be circulated) to the Redwall characters and a large poster. The poster is pretty, but this is not at all what we thought we were getting. I would give this less than one star if it were possible"
1,"Great concept, poor quality","This is a fun toy but it needs to be made better. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. You have to put your mouth too close for it to work, almost touching it. It changes your voice but then it is not understandable."
1,Waste of money,I give this a one rating because its a voice changer and all the voices sound the same. The other thing is you have to stick your mouth all the way into to it before you can hear a voice. Not worth the money.
1,Horrible Item,"Hated this product and it's currently being shipped back to seller.Thought I was getting an acutally product that worked seeing as though it wasnt the cheapest item ever. This doesnt make your voice change and when you talk into it all you hear is a loud screaching noise you can't even make out the fact that it's a ""voice"""
2,It seemed fun...,"In theory this is a fun toy, but sadly all but one of the settings just sound like a bunch of loud garbled noise. The one setting that does work entertained the kids for a while, thus the 2 stars. I ordered two of these and they are both just as loud and garbled sounding."
2,Voice changer,"When I opened the toy for my 2 yr old grandson, it did not work. I looked at the battery, thinking it may need to be replaced and found that it is an odd battery that most people would not keep on hand. I was disappointed that I stood there with a new toy for my grandson that he could not use. Once the battery is replaced I will write another review as to whther it actually works. From what I could tell it was cheaply made and doesnt look as though it would hold up for very long."
3,Fun toy but not terribly durable,I have 3 boys from 2 years to 10 and they all had a blast with this toy. The voices really don't change all that much with the different options but they didn't care. I got broken pretty quickly though when it got dropped on the tile floor so not very durable.
3,Loud Toddler Terror Toy,"Do any of the voices (Robot, Boy, Old Man or Kid) actually sound that cool? No. Can you actually understand a person when they speaks through it? No. Is it loud? Yes. But each does sound unique enough that it is entertaining, and definitely worth the mere $8 it costs."
3,kind of pleased,"I had tried to order another voice changer but it was unavailable so I ordered the Toysmith 3.5"" small Voice Changer #1378 instead. It did not do as much as I thought it would do but my grandchildren played with it. I was disappointed in it."
4,"Annoying to Parents, Fun to Kids","Although my brother and his wife didn't like the gift too much, haha. Two kids using it A LOT can be annoying, but fun for them at least. Arrived promptly and was packaged well. The only thing I didn't like is that all the voices somewhat sounded alike so the three settings didn't really serve their full function. Overall I would recommend this."
4,Fun for 5 to 35!,"Got this as a second little gift for my 5 year old grandson. Of course, his father, 30, took it right away and was having a blast with it. It was a neat addition to the Christmas fun!"
5,Noisy little toy,"Kid had a lots of fun with this toy,but his mother was not so happy.Its better to use it outside."
4,"Helpful, but too tight over the ribs","I have a small frame (5'0"", pre-pregnancy 115 lb, currently 27 weeks and 123 lb) and am carrying my baby low into the pelvic area. My doctor recommended this to help with sciatica and low back pain. I use the middle setting, and it helps to lift the weight of the uterus and baby off of my pelvis, and also relieves the low back pain so that I can stand up straight. My only complaint is that the section of elastic that goes across the ribs is not adjustable like the shoulder straps. It is tight and somewhat uncomfortable/itchy under the breasts, and exacerbates indigestion. I think having adjustable straps there would also make the entire thing easier to put on and remove. I am concerned that if my ribcage expands, I won't be able to use this anymore."
3,It's ok.,"I bought this in my 5th month of pregnancy because I was starting to get low back and round ligament pain. It was ok until I started getting a little bigger (around month 7). It was a bit of a pain to get on, it made my shoulders ache after wearing it for awhile, and it caused me to have weird fat bulges between the straps on my sides, very unattractive. I stopped using it and wished I had just bought one of those simple ones that is just a single strap that wraps around your back and under your belly."
1,Prenatal cradle,The small size indicates it fits up to 175 lbs however my daughter weighed 150 when we got this and it was too tight. I would opt for the next size because she is not able to wear it. She is due it January and by the time we return and receive another her pregnancy will be over. She still does not weigh 175 lbs.
5,YOU NEED THIS,"I bought this for my wife and it is so awesome!! If you are pregnant, especially like pretty far along pregnant, you need to get this thing because it is great! It really provides a lot of support to your lower back and holds your belly up really well and gives you a lot of relief. My wife hardly ever takes hers off haha! Anyway I really recommend it"
2,it's only okay,"I bought the prenatal cradle because I had been having problems with SPD during pregnancy. This product does provide some support for the belly, but I'm not convinced that it makes that much difference. Plus, it's kind of awkward to climb into and hard to find clothes that cover the shoulder straps. In my opinion, it's just not worth the money."
4,"Very good film, Steve Buscemi should have been nominated","Very good film, being Quentin Tarantino's film debut. Sadly, this film didn't get nomianted for an Oscar, but either Steve Buscemi, Lawernce Tierney or Tim Roth should have been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor. Can you believe there is only ONE woman in this film? But, who cares.This DVD has both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the movie, and only the widescreen version has DTS sound. The director himself makes a few apperances as Mr. Brown. But the first disc has five deleted scenes, inculding two alternate angles of the bloody ""EAR"" scene, one which is more graphic than the other. But, the more graphic angle when Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) slices off the ear, he's HOLDING the ear while he PRETENDS to slice it off! No wonder that angle wasn't in the film.Overall rating: 7/10"
5,Never Looked Better!,"This is one of my Favorite Movies and when I bought my PS3 this was going to be my first Blu-Ray, but the local store didn't have it.Finally got it, and man was worth it! The Movie seriously has never looked better, it was the first one where I noticed the difference easily, the others being both Pirates of the Caribbean.Had a friend over and just played the opening clip, his jaw was on the floor, he could not believe how good it looked!"
4,A remake of Ringo Lam's City On Fire,"Many who see Resevoir Dogs think QT is a genius because the plot seems so 'original. But for those of us who have seen Ringo Lam's City On Fire, starring Chow Yun Fat (of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fame), it is clear that RD is a rip-off, a frame-for-frame REMAKE of COF. QT built his reputation on RD but did not give any credit to the film he ripped off. After he was called on it by those who had seen COF, QT admitted he was 'influenced' by Hong Cinema. Hah! The only difference between the two films is that one is told through flashbacks while the other proceeds in chronological order.See the original, go and buy City On Fire and then watch Resevoir Dogs and tell me how 'original' QT's ideas are!!!"
5,Michael Madsen is a sick [guy]!!,"The most memorable part of this film is mike madsen. When i saw him in Getaway he's one mean [guy]. And after that I watched Reservoir Dogs, and right here he's another mean guy. But seeing that guy in action is pretty cool. haha"
3,be careful this is not the special tin edition,"Great Film, but be careful when purchasing as this is not the Tin edition."
5,"Intelligent, Stylish, Funny, Gruesome and Thrilling!","Reservoir Dogs has probably one of the best scripts ever to be put on film. The characters are strong as is the dialog in this tale of loyalty, honor and treachery.For critics to ban this film on the basis of 'graphic violence' was as ludicrous as OJ being set free, but hey! that's the system!If you haven't seen this movie yet, make sure you do, as it is clearly Tarantino's best movie to date."
3,Watchable,"I would like to know why people, myself included, will always associate this with The Usual Suspects (which is more entertaining). At least in the aspect that when one is mentioned, someone will say ""Have you seen (the other one)"" Anyway, this is okay, I am not one who particulary enjoys Tarentino's style, but this is watchable."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen,"This movie, together with Pulp Fiction, is the one of the best I have ever seen in my short life. Also has the mixing-the-story-up thing going on. Steve Buschemi and Harvey Keitel's performances are great. One of the most interesting scenes was when Mr. Orange was telling the story of his encounter with the cops in the commode. You do not know what a seriously good movie is until you see Reservoir Dogs."
4,Probably the the first gorefest to have wit.,A grizly good time that set new standards for screen violence in movies. The madonna speach(also on the soundtrack) is probably the most shocking dialoque you will ever in a movie. If you enjoy this movie I would check out the even better Pulp Fiction.
4,"Fascinating dialogue and unabated gore, great storyteller.","If you like Tarantino's quirky dialogue played to a background of disturbing mobish ""dirty work"", you will love it. Tarantino may have forever changed the standards of acceptable movie dialogue with his style."
2,Man cannot live on blood alone,"Well, if you like to watch people bleeding for 100 minutes, then this is the movie for you. I thought this was going to be a good caper story about a heist gone wrong. Yes, it was about a heist gone wrong, but it wasn't very good. The big mystery didn't keep me in much suspense, because Tarantino gave it away 20 minutes before the movie ended! The characters were all 2-dimensional. I could basically predict each character's move after watching the first scene. I would recommend ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" way over this movie."
4,Sleek and stylish!,Awesome movie. Such a sleek and stylish build of characters in an intense supercharged plot of a bank heist gone horribly wrong.And the detail of what happens to each member and how their distrust of each other spirals out of control is edge-of-your-seat terrific!Full of classic Taratino lines. Although the only problem with the film is that Tarantino is in it and at the beginning gives one of his typical self indulgent idiotic monologues Once you get past that the movie is a gem! Better than Pulp Fiction at times.
4,"Very good movie, cheap bluray, no special features","Good movie, crappy features. Quality of movie on bluray is no better than vhs or dvd. This movie was shot on a small budget at the time so it shows."
5,beautiful piece of artwork,It's an excellent piece of artwork with the right quantity of additional material in a beautiful metal cast case that's looks like the gas can of madman Mr. Blonde
3,Reservoir Dogs,"This film has been wildly overrated in some quarters(Europe, and the Editorial review on this page are two). Contrary to those opinions, RD is not as good as Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown, the two films it's writer-director, Quentin Tarantino, has made since. Reservoir Dogs has one major flaw--the sequence where Keitel and Roth go to the warehouse, and are met there by Buscemi goes on too long. Way, way too long. The film's editor, Sally Menke, wanted this scene to be shorter, and with good reason, this sequence is embarrasingly repetitive as Buscemi and Keitel seem to repeat their lines over and over. As soon as Madsen gets there, the film picks up and the rest of it is great."
1,Please check what you are purchasing carfully,"According to Amazon:Other Formats: VHS, DVD widescreen with DTS Stereo, DVDDTS is not a DVD Stereo format.DTS is for 5.1 and 6.1 surround sound on DVD."
1,A film about a bunch of psychos,"This is a film about killers - mindless psychos - the dregs of humanity - it is a cartoon sort of film with cartoon dialogue spoken by cartoon characters. It is directed by a cartoon character. It is without any virtue as adult entertainment. It is loved by cartoon characters who relate to the cartoon characters in the film. How sad. How about a film about decent people striving to rise above their limitations, about sacrifice and honour, about love and compassion, a film with insight and meaning and not just a slick orgy of foul mouthed psychos standing around killing each other? This movie is a toilet."
1,Boring!,"After the initial 1/2 hour of this movie, I just kept waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen but it never came. I'd love to know how many times I thought to myself, ""When the &%$# are they going to get out of this ""warehouse""? And that was after another unfortunately long and boring scene in the restaurant! The entire premise of the movie seems to be nothing more than a venue for Tarantino to indulge us all in terrible ""one-liners"". This ranks right up there with Super Troopers (which I actually mailed to someone - I was that eager to get rid of it)! I think I'll give this one away too!"
3,A MOVIE WITH POTENTIAL,"Of course, I bought this movie because I saw that it was directed by Quentin Tarantino. Overall, it was good, but there was a whole lotta dialogue and very little action. I was not expecting it to be like a ""Kill Bill,"" just something that would be a little more interesting. If it had more action, I would have rated it a 5 star. Other than that, it was good."
1,Warning: Extreme violence,"If you aren't up for watching a policeman being tortured, this is not your film. I know people who loved it, and if you enjoy the genre, it's as good as it gets. For my part, I wish I had never seen it. It was too stressful and the violence too pointless for my taste."
4,Great crime drama,"A crew of criminals rip off a diamond merchant. The cops intervene far more quickly than seems natural. Were the robbers set up? That's the question left for the survivors to puzzle out as they rendezvous back at their meeting place.Writer/director Quentin Tarentino has clearly learned the lesson that a basic, straightforward narrative gains intrinsic interest from a skilled skewing of narrative. What seems like an uncomplicated crime story gains new and unexpected levels because Tarentino chooses to shoot events in an unconventional order, often producing surprising juxtapositions. Recommended."
2,"Not a very good movie ,overall=Mediocre","Quentin Tarantino made his film debut with this low-budget,violent,and outrageous black comedy about a group a thieves that hide out in a warehouse and then try to figure what happened in the bank heist. The cast is good with Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Steve Buscemi(all three appeared in Tarantino's second and better movie Pulp Fiction),Michael Madsen,Chris Penn,and veteran actor Lawrence Tierney. The only reason this mediocre movie gets 2 stars is because the classic EAR scene. Quentin Tarantino second feature Pulp Fiction was much better."
1,"Great Movie, WRONG ITEM!!!!","This is an awesome movie, I already own it. I bought it again because I wanted the collector's case, that looks like a gasoline container. BECAUSE THE PICTURES ON AMAZON indicated it was the gas container cover I figured they weren't lying. So I get the DVD and it's a regular plastic case. I WANT TO CUT OFF AMAZON'S EAR."
2,Highly Overrated!!!,"I've been in a Tarantino mood after seeing Django Unchained. I watched this for the first time last night, and I didn't care for it. That ending was pitiful. After a jewel robbery goes wrong, the thieves believe one of them is a cop. Too much standing around and cussing, not enough action. I would not recommend RESERVOIR DOGS!!!"
3,Avid Movie watcher,I like action and drama movies the best. This movie was okay. It seemed like it started in the middle. I like a movie that gets my attention from the start. My Son in Law loves this movie and he recommended it It was drawn out and I didn't think it actually got interesting until the end. I watched the free download and gave the disc to him because it's not something I will watch again.
4,Awesome,"All, I have to say is A MUST WATCH!!!! I can say that every time I watch this movie I am happy with that decision:)"
5,GREAT FILMMAKING,"Qeuntin Tarantino's crime classic Reservoir Dogs is eqaully hasgood and entertaining as Pulp Fiction.Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Michael Madsen,Chris Penn,Steve Buscemi,Lawrence Tierney,andQeuntin Tarantino himself are the Reservoir Dogs.A group of thiev-s who are now in a s***load of trouble when their perfect plangoes perfectly wrong and they start to smell a rat in the houseand from there we get alot of blood,violence,and swearing.See this masterpiece now."
5,Alright. What is up with this box set?,"First of all, let me start off saying I love this movie with all my heart but, what's with the box set. Anyone who buys this is just plain stupid. The content is exactly the same on all the discs. There is no point in releasing a box set for the same movie with the same content on all 4 discs. The 5 stars are for the movie because, it rocks but I don't know about this box set crap"
4,"A great film, period.","Quentin's first remains one of his best, even better than Jackie Brown. Interesting dialogue, great acting, cool camera work and an intriguing plot. But you have to get the anniversary edition; the tribute to Lawrence Tierny alone is worth it! And I agree with the one reviewer who was disgruntled over buying the ""regular"" DVD only to discover a special edition was coming later. That's simply unfair and greedy. Although truth be told, the extras on Pulp and Jackie are interesting, but nothing except the most rabid Tarintino fan would lose any sleep over."
5,Brilliant,This is one of the best Quentin Tarrintino movies ever. It has great actors in he film. This is an allstar cast. All the acrors deliver a very powerful performance. This film has great lines in it and delivers some very funny dialogue. It will have your intrest for the entire movie. The action sequences are also done very well. The film is very suspenseful. Tarrintino's odd style of filming making this movie very cool. For a low budget film it could not have been any better than that.What also is cool about the film is how quentin shows you that it is okay to root for the bad guys. This is a classic and a movie everybody should have.
5,Still Terrific After All These Years,"And, it's easy to see why one of the alternate ear-amputation scenes was not used: The resulting wound, and it's pulsing blood, was reminiscent of Danny Aykroyd's cut-and-bleeding finger in his comedy skit portrayal of chef Julia Child. The film's final cut (ha, ha) was the best one, understated yet chilling.And, the scene with the female detective who provided background on the gang members should have been left in. The movie wasn't too long anyway -- that scene would have added depth to it.Great cast, great plot, great writing, great film."
3,Hollywood loves reboots too much,"The Movie was pretty interesting but seriously, Hollywood, we need to have a talk. I know the success of the recent Batman, James Bond, and Lambchop movies have taught you that gritty reboots are the way to go. But comon, this has nothing to do with the original story of Snow Dogs, and you totally cut Cuba Gooding Jr out! I bet he was available to star in this movie. I don't think it even takes place in the north, did you save anything from the original? Taken by itself the movie is interesting and intense, but I cannot get past the total disregard for the source material. What is next? A gritty reboot of Boat Trip on whaling ship crewed by ex-cons that kill each other after cutting off their ears while ""Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"" plays in the background?"
1,Great Movie - BAD DVD Sound,"Don't get my rating wrong-this is a 5 star movie, but the sound is horrible. And I've tried this DVD on a number of players and sound systems with all the bells and whistles. I also have a friend with the same DVD who sares this complaint.For instance, one can't hear what finally happens to Mr. Pink. If I had not seen it in a movie theater, I would have thought there was a different ending. ...you can clearly hear what happens to Mr. Pink on the VHS version!!!I'm surprised someone seemingly as meticulous as Quentin Tarentino would let such [stuff] slip by.Hopefully, the 10th anniversary edition will correct the soundtrack.If it does, I'll sell this sub-par one off toward its purchase.This is a great movie for all the reasons the other reviewers site."
1,DELIVERED A DIFFERENT VERSION = NO SPECIAL PACKAGING,"i was most let down upon recieving the dvd, as it wasnt the i pictured...i got just the 2 disc version, no special edition packaging and no extra gifts = matches..this was a major let down to me ,as im a dvd collector..from now on i will e-mail amazon before ordering to agree it is the item pictured."
1,"GREAT FILM, BUT PICTURE ON SPECIAL EDITION IS TERRIBLE","The picture quality of this new special edition DVD is soft to the point that it looks like the film has been exposed to light. The sound is fine, yet - like a previous reviewer - I found myself constantly fiddling with the colour, contrast and brightness buttons. And to no avail.Of the 250 plus DVDs in my collection this print of Reservoir Dogs easily rates as one of the worst three. You have been warned."
1,Nothing but a rip-off,"Quentin Tarantino doesn't have a creative bone in his body. All he did was rip off the Hong Kong movie, ""City on Fire"" and added his crappy dialogue.I could steal any number of ideas from different movies and make them into my own. However, it does not make me a film-making genius as people seem to believe Tarantino is...."
1,Psychopath Chic,"If you've seen Scarface, Casino, Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, or countless others of the genre, then you don't need to see this one. The bad guys are once again totally hip - way cooler than the cops or ordinary citizens - this time wearing shades and matching dark suits with skinny ties and lapels, like some kind of '70's new wave band. These way cool guys go on to rob, murder, mutilate a cop, and leave a companion to bleed for the entire movie.It's as if there is a contest between directors of this genre to see who can show the most depraved characters, or who can use the F-word the most time in 5 minutes of dialogue.Other than the slick clothes, Steve Buscemi's character is virtually interchangeable with the one in Fargo, except that this time he likes the DeFranco Family rather than Jose Feliciano.This movie is cliche and disgusting at the same time."
2,WRONG VERSION!!,"The movie itself is great! If you're gonna buy this just based on the movie, then by all means. You're not gonna regret it.HOWEVER, if you're buying this expecting a Gas Can Version of the DVD, think again. It is not the tin casing that is displayed in the product details. I received the wrong version, that is, the normal DVD casing, the first time round. When Amazon sent me a replacement shipment, I still got the wrong version. So DON'T BUY THIS if you're expecting the brilliant-looking Gas Can Edition as displayed in the picture."
3,Deceiving,The picture makes you think that it's the special edition 15th anniversary edition that comes in a gas can and the movie resembles a box or matches. Not the case here it's the right edition of the movie but the packaging is different. So if packaging is something you care about just pick it up at your local best buy.
3,Tarentino's directorial/writer debut (3.5/5),"i was pleasantly surprised by this feature film debut of Quentin Tarantino as writer/director.i had heard all the hype of how great it was over the years and was sure i would be disappointed.as it turns out,it was a pretty good film.great dialogue.memorable characters.smooth transitions from one scenes to another.the story was interesting.there's some violence,but bot at all at the level i was expecting.in fact,i had seen a lot worse before than and even directly after,while watching True Romance,coincidentally also written by Tarantino.True romance is much more blood soaked than Reservoir Dogs.however,there is some some very strong language.in conclusion,while i certainly wasn't disappointed in Reservoir Dogs,i wouldn't say it's a great movie.for me,Reservoir Dogs is a 3.5/5"
5,MasterPiece :P,"heh Who doesn't own Reservoir Dogs 10th Anniversary Special Limited Edition.'tis Masterpiece in Violence,You gotta add this one to your library ,,I love it much :P"
5,Tarantinos 1st movie,I'm a follower of every Tarantino movie. This is one of his better movies. I liked the way it told the story and the relentless violence plus the ending is a total mind blower. This was just a great movie.
5,TARANTINOS BEST FILM!!!,"Reservoir Dogs is tarantinos best film. It was also his first. It tells the story about a perfect robbery by a perfect gang wich has the leadings of harvie ketel,Tarantino,michal madesin and more. What they find out is it is a damn setup!One of there members was a rat! But who? Soon you'll find out and over all it was by far one of the my most favorite films.It shows how the male bond handles through in situations wereyou go crazy. It is filled with violence and foul language but hey! Its a gangster movie so what can you say huh!It will forever be tarantinos best film than pulp fiction.It shows in this movie that who can you trust and who you cant.Thats why I love this movie!The dvd is good. I recommend it to alldeleted scences and ectget it.......you wont be dissapointed."
1,What a DOG of a flick,"I love Pulp Fiction, so I thought this must be a great movie, too. I'm baffled by the positive reviews. This movie has a great cast but a simple plot. I kept waiting for it to make some sense or interest me. It never happened. Once is too many times to view this movie. Don't waste your money. It doesn't live up to all the hype."
3,Dissappointing,"One really big dissappointment to me is us not seeing this so called crazy robbery scene. We constantly hear how Michael Madsens character went nuts at the scene, I dont understand why they did film that instead of that stupid car hand holding scene between white and orange, why would some big time gangster all of a sudden have a big heart and feel for this guy. If only they filmed a shooting scene at the robbery, this movie would of been A LOT better."
2,Hope you like violence..,"Probably the most violent movie I've seen and not all that good. If you want something disturbing but more creative and well done, check out ""Memento"" instead."
5,Awesome as hell! Mr. Blonde kicks!,"This movie is awesome. I've seen it about a 1000 times, n ill neva get sick of it. Full of classic lines. Trust me, despite how good ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" were, this is Tarantino's best film. My favortie ""Dog"" was Mr. Blonde. I can't picture anyone else in that role but Michael Madsen. He's cooly psychotic, the type of guy who if you're a deranged person like me you want to meet. Mr. Pink is also great. Steve Buscemi is excellent. In fact, I can't even start to imagine anyone else in this movie. Truly great, and not as encreadibly ""graphic"" as everyone says. You see blood, but a lot is in the distance. In fact the most graphic scene isn't the infamous ""ear"" scene, but when Mr. Orange is in the car driving to the wearhouse. Check it out!"
4,"Not as Flashy as Tarntino's other films, but still very good","This may be Tarantino's most serious film. I say serious, because most of his films always have a sense of irony and humor under evry theme. This still has alot of humor and irony, but it is far more tragic than his other films. This is also far less flashy than his next two crime epics. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown both have visuals to die for, and this one is far more restrained. This is bloody. Very bloody. It is also very hard to view at times (more or less because of what you don't see, as oposed to what you do see), yet it is always very striking and potent. Violence is glamorized, but it is also given as a very realistic fact of society. The film does seem to drag towards the end, but it still is a very excellent debut from an obviously promising director."
5,"Wow, great Quentin Tarantino","Wow, What a movie! This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The action, the story line, the ending, the SOUNDTRACK, gees, how much greater could this movie get? You must be a Tarantino type of person to truly appreciate this flick. See it now -Teph"
4,Good movie and great start to an amazing directing life for Tarantino,"This movie was a good movie and great start for Tarantino directing life. It had a great script and the beginning for the film was very funny with them in the resturant. The movie was a good drama with a mixture of action scenes lots of bad language, and all the actors trying to figure out who set them up for the fall. Still an all star cast two of the actors went on to be in Pulp Fiction, another actor stared in Con Air and so forth. But if your looking for a good drama movie, lots of guns being shot off, and trying to guess which character that was the one who set them up for the job, then pick this movie up and enjoy the movie and what it has to offer inculding some killer special features. If your already a Tarantino fan then you should already own it."
2,"Criminals are not interesting, and neither is this film","Structurally, this film is great at demonstrating how bits of restaurant conversation are made manifest in the later actions of its characters. Well, big deal. These characters are more boring than even some of my relatives. When all the blood has coagulated and all the shouting is over you'll feel blessed relief. Will Tarantino ever make a movie without handguns as his central prop? I suspect a lot of us would like to see him try."
2,Worst Bonus Disc EVER,"Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of Quentin Tarantino, and I think this movie is great. Except for the second disc. The second disc is just full of so much CRAP! 15 second soundbites, interviews with people you have never heard of, people reading reviews of the movie aloud, chapters of books?! Who the HELL is gonna sit there and read the squished text of chapters of books on a tv screen? Not me. And the K-Billy interactive radio is pretty pathetic, except for the last button. And the poster gallery....it only has 3 posters! And the style guide doesn't exist...you'll see what I mean. Avoid buying this!"
3,If your attention begins to waver,"You see, Quentin Tarantino movies are pretty good. This one's ok. Instead of just being clever, it's just a little bit too graphic. When situations become too uncomfortable or the dialogue gets a little cheesy, well just cut someone's ear off, right? That'll get your eyes focused on the screen. And it'll seem cool at the time, but later, as you reflect back, you realize that those few, brutal, gory scenes are nothing more than shockers to keep you interested, lest your eyelids begin to sag. Kubrick does this too, like in A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut. The movies are ok, but take out the unnecessary, and youre left with nothing special."
2,Subpar at best,"A little while back, a friend of mine offered to let me borrow Pulp Fiction. I watched it and loved it. Then she let me borrow Jackie Brown, which I also loved. I figured, ""Hey, I like Tarantino movies, so I should go out and buy Reservoir Dogs!"" Err, bad decision.The movie's violence didn't gross me out or offend me in anyway, as it has others which was the reason for their bad reviews, but the movie itself just wasn't good enough for me. The characters were all boring and I could care less about any of them. The dialogue is nowhere near as good as any of Tarantino's later films and the pace of the movie is slower than Pulp Fiction which is a full hour longer than this movie. I tried watching this movie again and again but it just got worse each time.I say, rent Reservoir Dogs first. If you like other Tarantino movies, you might like this. But then again you might hate it like I did."
5,Great Transfer,Amazed by the quality of the bluray...that along with this grand movie makes this this a good purchase.
1,Repulsive at best,"Having previously purchased ""Jackie Brown""...a film with a wonderful plot and some redeeming value...I thought I would give another Quentin Tarantino picture a try. As this is the movie that supposedly started off his successful career, I figured this was a great place to start.What a repulsive piece of celluloid this movie turned out to be. Violence in a movie for a reason is one thing. Violence for shock value is quite another. There doesn't really seem to be any reason for this movie to exist except to disgust the viewer with it repugnant bloodshed.This is the kind of movie which really makes me question as to whether Hollywood DOES have some responsibility toward desensitizing weak individuals into replicating such violent acts."
