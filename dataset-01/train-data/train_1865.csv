4,It just works,"This is our standard issue thumb drive in my office. At least it was a year or so ago. Those who remember the good old days of the five and a quarter and three and a half... well, its just amazing to see where the technology has come. There are larger thumb drives out there, but this is a solid little performer.For the purposes of 'sneakernetting' files from one location to another, its a very useful solution. One word of warning. After about six to eight months of use, the keyring attachment at the end developed a crack. Its only plastic... but if you're carting your data around on your keys, just be aware. I do like the fact that this has the keyring attachment on the drive, and not on the cap - as some do.For the price, its a great option !"
5,good buy,The Kinston Data Traveler is sure a good buy for 14 $. You should not think twice before taking it.
4,Excellent Product for the price i paid,"The flash drive has an excellent price for the capacity it offers, but the only thing i didnt like is that it didnt bring an neck strap so i have to carry it in my pocket all the time."
4,Kingston Data Traveler Review,"Very good product, very good price; wish it had a light like my others."
5,We love this!,"I cannot believe how much this little 1GB guy holds. My husband and I needed to take our computer in to be worked on so we literally backed up all of our must-have files directly to it and had room to spare. We are graduate students so we had 2 years' worth of schoolwork, papers, and syllabi for two people saved, in addition to our entire catalog of photos. We aren't super happy photo takers so it's not like we have 1000s of pictures to store, but well into the several hundreds and it stored it all perfectly, like I said with room to spare. It also comes in handy for transport of files to another computer for various reasons. We love it, like the Kingston brand (we've bought several of their items), and think it's a fantastic value. I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Excellent Flash Drive,"It is a excellent drive, fast transfer, small and cheap, i have bought two until now and no problem."
5,Great value,I've been using this Kingston drive for three months with complete satisfaction. Can't believe it only cost $10.00 for 1 gig.
4,Practically Perfect,"Very good item for the price, smaller than my antiquated 256mb flash drive it replaced. The ONLY negative is how the cap fits onto the back of the drive while you're using it. It's not supposed to fit entirely on the posts provided for the cap to attach to in order for a lanyard to fit as well. Because of this the cap can easily crack if you push it to hard onto the posts on the back. That may be a minor design flaw, but prevents this from a full 5 stars in my book."
5,Great Deal For The Price !,"Hey, for $15.00 and it works I am a very happy boy ! No problems just plug and play."
1,Not happy with this one.,"I was happy for about a year with this, but then one day it just broke and hasn't been able to be fixed or repaired with software, so it's now just a broken piece of junk."
1,Please Respond if somebody reads the reviews,"I never received my purchase, i have sent numerous emails to amazon and to the other vendor, but no body ever responded."
4,Excellent media Storage Device,Great storage device. I would only add one lanyard for carrying it. I am very pleased with this product.
5,excellent product !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think that this product deserve 5 points, it's an excellent product that fall me a lot of times and still works. the Data Transfer is very fast.and actually the price is very worth."
4,1gb flash drive,I have used it for a month with USB1.0 and USB2.0 with no problems. It currently holds over 900 Mb of files. It is very handy. I anticipate however that this particular model will eventually have problems with the cap not staying on. It is plastic and very loose already. With a little wear it will probably just fall off.Definitely recommend Blue Proton at this point.
5,Works fine.,"This is a handy flash drive like many others, but at a good price. Some reviewers have complained that it did not work with an external usb hub, but it works fine on my D-Link 7-port external hub."
5,Flash Drive,"Works fine. Was a gift to my daughter who does a lot of tax returns, gave her the opportunity to take her work home in her purse."
4,Flash Drive,"I bought it because I needed a cheap one gig flash drive. It functions correctly, is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and was dirt cheap. I am satisfied."
4,good deal,very good deal on this flash drive. fast shipping. just what I needed for college classes.
5,Data on the go has never been easier.,"This flash drive does everything I wanted a transportable drive to do. I can move anything from songs and photos to whole applications, faster than a speeding bullet. The unit does require Win-XP or Mac OS 10, but that was listed in the system requirements, so I was not suprised by it. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Data Traveler,"This product serves its purpose. The only difficulty I've had is when I use the 'safe removal of hardware' icon on the computer. The message tells me the device is in use even when the applications are closed. Otherwise, I am very pleased."
5,Great,I purchased this flash drive for my wife to save her assignment presentations for school and it works perfect.
4,"Works great on PC, Mac, and Solaris","Works great on PC, Mac, and Solaris. I used it to transfer data among PC, Mac, and Solaris and all three could read the drive with no extra software needed. I did have some problems with Linux, though. I tried to load DSL Linux so that I could create a liveUSB disk, but Linux wouldn't boot from it. I was able to get a liveUSB for Belenix (OpenSolaris) to boot, though."
3,Inconsistent performance,"One of my computers has a hard time maintaining a connection to this drive, resulting in constant beeping and pop-ups as it keeps thinking the device has been removed then added back. No such problems with my other computer (both are running XP). My smaller USB drives work fine on both computers."
3,Life Saver,My wife uses her flash drive for work and it saves her a lot of hastle when she can't remote into her work computer.
5,Great Drive,I really like the Kingston flash drives. They work in every computer and are immediately accessible when plugged in. No hassles.
5,Very good quality and very good price,Im really happy with this flash drive; its works perfect and have a 5 year warranty in hardware by kingston.
5,Great Price,"I needed a new flash drive and just before going to Best Buy, I remembered to check Amazon...probably saved myself thirty bucks. I use Kingston memory cards for my camera and have never had any problems whatsoever. So far I have had a good experience with this as well...my dell had no problem detecting and recognizing it and files transfer quickly. It probably has more space than I really need, but it's nice to have it just in case. I guess that's all you can ask from a flash drive..."
3,Had to reformat it to make it work,"The drive would not work until I reformated it. Also I had to Quick format it before a full reformat would work. Also it came formatted ""FAT"" versus ""FAT32"" so it was incompatibile with various Digital Picture frames (e.g. Coby models)Addendum: the REAL issue is that this a USB 2.0 ONLY device. Even after I reformatted it, once I took it out of my (USB 1.1) computer, it was unusable in my computer- although in works fine in USB 2.0 computers"
4,Fantastic !!,"LOVE IT....Plug it in and away you go. It's simple, easy, and CHEAP.Store a pile of Data, Pictures or whatever you like. Go look in thestores at what they cost....forget it. It's small enough to carry inyour pocket or briefcase. Take it anywhere."
3,Works on Linux,"Works fine. But I'm not sure the cap will stay on after it's been removed & replaced a couple hundred times, and it doesn't come with a strap or lanyard like most others. Still a good deal though."
2,Cheap but slow; cannot be used by Vista's ReadyBoost,"The Kingston 1GB DataTraveler flash drive is very cheap -- it can often be found for free after rebate. It's small and convenient, but speed is quite lacking. Copying files takes a long time. Worse, I just found out it cannot be used for Windows Vista's ReadyBoost feature (which speeds up system performance) because Vista deems it too slow."
3,Cheap,"Great price but be really careful it can break really eaisly, I would just spend an extra twenty and find a better one."
3,"Good data storage, but case could be better","I've had this USB Flash drive for several months now, and I have never experienced any problems accessing or storing data on this drive. From that standpoint, the drive has been flawless. However, I like to keep my USB Flash drive on my keychain, and the plastic loop is barely big enough to allow it to sit on the metal ring of my keychain (my keychain being a standard metal ring keychain, not over sized). Finally, the plastic ring part broke, and I can't attach the flash drive to my key chain anymore. If only they made the plastic ring a little (just a few millimeters, really) bigger or if they made the plastic ring out of metal instead, this wouldn't happen. I just think the case could have been better designed. Otherwise, the drive works well."
4,Short Little Review,"Pros:-Durable-Mac and PC compatible-Lightweight-Great Price-Reliable brand (Kingston)-1GB storageCons:-Cap comes on kind of frequent-Not too stylish-Not as good as Sandisk-No lanyard-Must have Windows 2000/XP or MacOS9 or higher (not good for those old school users)BOTTOM LINE: It could be faster, better, have more caps, and a lanyard. But if you have a somewhat new computer, this is a great deal."
1,Defective Product,The drive indicates it has 1 gb of space but only holds about half of that... I returned it for a refund. Amazon was very good about quickly responding to the problem.
2,Not Up To Snuff,"I've had this flash drive for 9 months (since March 2007), and today it died completely. It's fried. This happened spontaneously while my computer was dead, so I don't have a backup. I didn't abuse it, and it was under normal conditions in my pocket, and now I'm very unsatisfied.BUY A FREAKING SANDISK!!!"
4,Makes A FINE Jacket,"This USB drive is very nice for storing data, but what the instructions for it don't say that is that putting 150 of these together to make a fine jacket would allow you to store over 150GB of data, plus get you into a swanky Italian restaurant by just adding a tie and some slacks.It's also impact resistant. The jacket, that is."
2,Fragile keychain attachment point,"I have had a another manufacturer's USB flash drive for over 3 years, and needed more space.Last year Amazon recommended this model , and the price was right.the problem was, that within a month of getting this drive, the part that holds it to your keychain fractured. I used it for awhile but found myself forgetting or misplacing it more and more.I still have the old, smaller one, on my keychain every day. I couldn't tell you where this one went. And a flash drive that you don't consistently have with you is really of limited use, and more of a bother than it's worth."
3,INCOMPETENT SERVICE!,I did not received this order. I had to order it from another seller.When I contacted the seller they said my address was wrong and would not make a full refund. My address wascorrect. I know my address. In fact its populated by Amazon and I've always received my orders without a problem. I communicated this to the seller and they ignored me and kept my money. I'm still out of pocket.I will NEVER order anything from them again!
4,Good product,I bought several flash drives for each of my parents and my nephew. They are in love with them. Thank you.
4,Seems pretty good.,"Hasn't given me any trouble and was very cheap so it seems good for its price. It doesn't work on an old laptop I have though which has a USB 1.0 drive. I don't know if thats because of the usb drive or because there is something wrong with the computer though. Still, a good product."
3,BettyLou,"Kingston has always had a good product, but I prefer a flash drive that does not have a removable cap. I inevitably lose the caps."
3,Handy gadget,"These little gems are lifesavers. This one performs well. The problem is while most have a metal loop for attaching to a keychain, Kingston, sadly, made theirs out of plastic and it broke the first time I put my keys in my pocket. I expected more from a name brand like Kingston."
3,Windows 98SE warning,"You'd think all flash drives would be Windows 98SE compatible, or at least they'd make it a point to emphasize that they weren't, in large print. It turns out that Kingston doesn't support this drive for Windows 98SE, though you can see that it was planned to be supported. They offer two drivers that you can try... but neither worked for me or a friend of mine. The price was good, but you'd think they could do as well as other manufacturers as far as compatibility."
5,A Good Thing To Have,"I bought this Flash Drive because I have a lap top and a desk top. Whenever I type anything on my lap top I wanted to have a way to get it to the desk top for printing and someone recommended a flash drive, so I bought this."
5,cheap gig a storage,"This is probably the cheapest 1 gb flash drive you'll find that's also reliable and durable. I was contemplating on buying an mp3 player that's also a flash drive, but this was just too cheap!"
3,You get what you pay for,"This product is a prime example of the old law ""you get what you pay for"". It's cheap, and consequently it has some problems. It will not recognize some symbols (such as a forward slash) so that I have had to re-title some files in order to save them. It is slow to put away. On the plus side, it has a lot of memory and is very compact. So for a backup to your backup it's probably an okay deal."
5,love this datatraveler,"the only thing i wish i had known about it, but then later figured out. when storing and taking items off the the data stick, it has it's own trash can that fills up that you need to ""empty"" when it claims there is no space left to hold information when there is clearly nothing stored in there. basically information gets stored in the trash bin every time you put things on it and take them off."
3,Kingston data traveler,I have used the data traveler once since I got it.I feel it is quite slow in downloading and uploading the data.when i needed to correct my downloaded information it took just as long to get it downloaded. It serves my purpose but is quite slow.
4,SMALL GIANTS,The first time I purchased this drive I actually purchase three of them. I showed them to a couple of my friends and they fell in love with them after I would have outline a few things about them. I did not get to use mine since one of my friends had an instant need for it. He has been quite impressed with its performance. I have since bought five more of these drives and is currently using mine. They are neat beyond a doubt and are very easy to use and of course very reliable. I only have one problem: I find the shipping to be a little to high. For this I gave it 4 stars. The drive itself deserve 5 stars.
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT,I DID NOT RECEIVE THE FOUR KINGSTON DATA TRAVELER 1 GB USB. I HAVE A CLAIN IN MY BANK ABOUT IT. AMAZON MUST HELP ME TO RESOLVE THIS CLAIN BECAUSE I HAD BEEN CUSTOMER FOR LONG TIME.
5,Review of Kingston Flash drive.,"Kingston Data Traveler 1 GB USB Flash Drive ( DTI/1GB )Great product, user friendly and it was shipped quickly. Highly recommended."
5,Fast and portable,"I really like this product, it helps me get more organized and I have started using it to store music. It's awesome."
5,WOW!,"This little USB drive is pretty typical, but it comes in handy. The reason I am so excited about it is I just sent it through the wash, complete cycle, then through the dryer, because I left it in my pants pocket. I remembered maybe 4 or 5 hours after the laundry was done, and I immediately groaned and found it right where I had left it, right in the pocket. I decided to try it to see how bad the damage was, and plugged it into my computer. I waited and then, all of a sudden, the little light lit up and I checked the drive. I did not lose any data! It still had full capacity! It was completely functioning! I tested the data transfer, and it still works. It was as if I had left it sitting on the desk rather than subjecting it to the terrors of the laundry. I was sufficiently amazed."
2,the purchase is made by only 3 and I arrived 2 Kingston Data Traveler 1 GB USB Flash Drive,"Good day,He writes francis from Venezuela and inform you that I can not give good reviews since received only 2 Kingston Data Traveler 1 GB USB Flash Drive when the purchase took place 3 and were deducted from my account the amount of 3, I appreciate your comment on it .... Thanks"
2,Not nearly as good as earlier albums.,"I have to say I'm pretty disapointed with this cd. The phone calls aren't nearly as funny as the other albums. It does have some bright spots, though. But the part I really didn't like was the Roy's Fishin' Reports. They just don't do anything for me. So if you're new to Roy D Mercer, I reccomend volumes 1-3. Better luck next time Roy D."
1,Roy D. Mercer is a hack!,"Roy D. Mercer is a rip-off. The original Leroy Mercer was a man by the name of John Bean, from Knoxville, TN. He found out he was dying and decided to live life to its fullest. He made the prank calls in the late 70's and early 80's and died in 1984, at the age of 33. I grew up in East Tennessee, and I remember getting a bootleg tape of his around '91. I have been hooked ever since. Bean's work is classic, he gets the people so made they could kill him. If you wany to know where this all originated it has samples of his calls there and info on how to get the CD of his classic pranks."
1,A Rip-Off,"If you have heard a bootleg recording of Leroy Mercer phoning a Thom McAn store and a junkyard mechanic and you think this CD is the same guy, IT'S NOT. This ""Roy D. Mercer"" obviously heard the same recording and is trying to rip off the original, but he's nowhere near as funny. I was told that the original was a ""police surveillance tape"" and that Leroy Mercer is a real person. If anybody has any additional information on the REAL Mr. Mercer, please email me!!!!"
1,Same thing warmed over once again...,"Putting aside the fact that Roy ""borrowed"" his prank idea from Leroy, this CD has the same prank call premise agonizingly rehashed again for the 5th time. Call someone up, complain that he's been wronged, demand compensation, and then half-heartedly say that he ""might have to come down there to give someone a ... whooping"". Furthermore we get to listen to that same Oklahoma draw voice of his (or whatever you call it). Often his call victims pick up on the phony voice, and just hang on the phone to play along for fun. Roy's ""character"" isn't gritty or edgy. If you like Luke warm, ""Senior citizen approved"" calls then maybe you can sit through this for the 5th time. As for my likes, these CD's aren't half as titillating and inventive as the Jerky Boys, Musacha Tapes, TTT, Phil Hendrie, and the Bum Bar Bastards."
2,Colourful and Dangerous,"The friend who lent this to me was surprised when I showed him the Acknowledgments page listing a handful of inspirational business books. However secondhand the business anecdotes might be, the sheer energy of Leadership Secrets is inspirational. But as other reviewers have pointed out, contrary to Mr. Marcinko, Business is not War. Please don't visit his battle-inspired insights on your staff."
2,2 stars for the war stories,"What a JOKE! Marcinko's so called advice is nothing more than the vague,windy exhalations of a Rogue Blowhard. ""Lead from the Trenches"" There I just saved you the time you would have wasted if you had read the entire book. It's not a bad point, but that's all you get for your effort. If you are one of those business men that likes to pretend he's a samurai then maybe you'd like this gaseous rag. But if you want to run a successful business, look elsewhere for help.Read W.E.B. Griffith's books instead. The business advice is just as non-existant as in this book but the war stories are much better"
4,Practical application in specific situtations,"I attended a military service academy and received much formalized leadership training. Most of this training was geared for what worked in the sterile corporate environment of officership. That training had its merits for its intended purpose. I now own a large contracting company. Those lessons don't work well for the crews in the field. Marcinko's lessons are much more applicable. Marcinko is rude, crude, testosterone laden - but most importantly effective. He understood his audience and what worked and what didn't. This is the key. I require all my job foreman to read this book. To management level personnel I'll give Steven Covey - but not to the guys who sweat & bleed for a living and have to get others to do the same."
4,Nice book you can read in 3 hours,"I received the book tonight and finished it before I realized I had been through the last chapter. The style is direct and quite pleasant if your personality fits the guy. I am a simple minded, down to earth person and I liked the non-sense talk during the book. The author defines a simple, yet pretty smart framework, that makes the decision process quite straight forward. I don't know if corporate America really looks like the authors depicts it, but it seems definitely accurate in most respect. All in all I liked the book and I think I will keep most of the advices in the back of my head for a little while."
5,He exemplifies the code of the warrior.,"Demo dick is the ipitomy of the best the United States Navy has to offer, he led from the front. Having personal experience in the teams for 12 years, I can attest to the fact that he is the real mcCoy, not some guy tring to make money as an author. This book is a truism; an authentic view at the way that all managers, and supposed leader's of men, should lead their forces into battle. Know your company, know your competition, & know your future. Like the skipper says, ""The code of the warrior is to delight in battle"", and, ""You don't have to like it, but you have to do it. ""OOO-YUH !"""
4,Motivating and an encouragement to young leaders,"Being a military brat I enjoyed the military stories about applied leadership. As a young professional, I enjoyed the examples the author gave from the business world."
4,"A ""fun"" watch","Very big watch, which has a niche role for me for very casual occasions. I like it, but some of my friends have chided me for wearing a ""clock on my wrist."" The ""lefty"" design really does make the watch feel more comfortable on the right wrist. I am NOT left handed, so I tried to wear it on my left wrist, but the crown irritated my arm. Wearing a watch on the opposite wrist is kind of weird. It is a ""fun"" watch, not a ""daily driver"" for me."
3,Good style but the quality is lacking,"Initially I was very happy with this watch as it offered classic styling with a good size chronograph for a great price. However, second hand (red at noon) became loose and shaky after a few months. Further on, the bottom chronograph resets to the 10 minute hand rather than zero. I took it to a watch repair shop and he said it will be quite expensive to open up the case and reset this considering the value of the watch. The watch looks great (elegantly oversized) and these are not major flaws considering the price but if you value accuracy in your watch selection Invicta watches may not be the best choice. From experience, Citizen or Sieko will likely save you time and headaches in the future."
3,Overpriced,"I got this kit for my 10-year-old daughter, who had wanted it very badly for a long time. The box made it look like you were getting this big, lovely kit, but that was a little deceptive. Most of what was inside the box was styrofoam packaging. The candy-making tools themselves were fine, but for what you get, you'd probably be better off buying the supplies individually from a local kitchen-supply store. I think the best thing in this kit was the little booklet of instructions, which had some interesting facts about candy, including the fact that modern children eat WAY too much sugar as it is, which made me wish I had never bought the thing in the first place. But alas, it was a gift for my daughter, so I'll let her keep it!"
3,It's ok...,"Well, I had high hopes for this product as my now 4 year old has almost 3 years experience in the kitchen. It is ok, just not really geared towards kids. We were really expecting the instructions, recipes, and prep methods to facilitate working with your kids step by step. It's just not there."
5,I love Dove Cool Moisture,"A few months back I received a sample Dove Cool Moisture bar from the manufacturer and I've been hooked on this soap ever since! The soap is very refreshing to use and the scent is a nice even mixture of masculinity and feminity, making this product an ideal use for both men and women."
5,I was one of the first people to view this film.,"My cousin is Darren Foldes, who worked on this movie. I was one of the first people to see this, along with my other cousins, before the movie was released. It was our job to review the film and we all loved it. My youngest cousin watched it three times! I would reccomend it for younger children."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this film would be a great movie for my 7 and 9 year old first year soccer players. Right off the bat it started with very crude language and very bad attitudes from the kids. We don't allow our kids to talk like this, and can't imagine that people encourage their kids to either. It may be more appropriate for older kids, but I can't see it keeping their interest unless they are teen boys waiting for the next appearance of the Aunt. The only redeeming parts that got it 2 stars were the pep-talk at the half of the game and the little bit with Cobi as the delivery man."
2,Disappointing.,This movie was disappointing. The fat kid didn't fart enough. I like farting. He should have farted more often.
2,Is definitly not a family movie!,"It is not a family movie as described.Since it was recommened by Parenting,I thought it would be fine.Did not allow my 7 year old grandson see it.I'm glad I watched it first."
2,Be aware!,"This cd is a re-recording from 1998 of his songs pop, country and otherwise. This isn't that little kid's voice. It's the voice of a middle-aged man."
4,Slept On,"You gotta give it to Puff. The man knows what he's doing when it comes to finding, developing, and marketing talent. G-Dep's album was one I almost slept on. However, after experiencing a drought of what I think is decent hip hop, I decided to take a chance on the kid who's first two singles, ""Let's Get It"" and ""Special Delivery"" adremaline charged head-nodders. But first I had to preview at my local record shop and track after track were burners. The production on this album ranks among the best from top to bottom on any Bad Boy release and that's saying a lot. G-Dep's on ""special"" delivery is remarkably clever and poised for a freshman effort. The stand-outs on the album are the aforementioned tracks as well as he-says, she says ""Smash on the First Night"" and ""Child of the Ghetto"".G-Dep's unassuming demeanor might catch you sleeping. But don't."
4,history in the making,G-dep will be the greatest even if Jay-z is here because the man just can rap he says all this stuff that just make me like him ex(right jab like zab judha and remember my whole team is a shotter tight like a wond no time for intrudas)I love this man he is going to be a big break for p. diddy since shyne went to jail.
4,"Not a Bad Boy Fan, but a G.Dep Fan","I'm not a Bad Boy fan, I'm a 2Pac fan (U know the whole ""Bad Boy Killaz"", Pac - Biggie beef). But I'am a G.Dep fan. I'm gonna admit I don't listen 2 closely to beatz, I'm more of a lyricz person so I can't tell u if the beatz are amazin' or not, but the lyricz R. His flow is akward yet understandable N enjoyable. Many topicz R Xplored on this album. 4 the record my favorite track on this album is ""Everyday"" (#2)."
5,ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS EVER!,"ITS A SHAME THIS ALBUM JUST DIDN'T BLOW UP THE WAY I THOUGHT IT SHOULD HAVE. I THINK BADBOY RECORDS IS TO BLAME FOR NOT PROMOTING IT WELL. THE PRODUCTION & THE LYRICS ARE AMAZING FROM START TO FINISH, LISTEN TO THE LYRICS AND PLAY THIS ALBUM LOUD ON A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM, TRUST ME, YOU WON'T BE SORRY. I HOPE G. DEP'S NEXT ALBUM WILL BRING THE SUCCESS HE RIGHTFULLY DESERVE, I'LL BE FIRST IN LINE TO GET IT."
4,Great!,"Like Black Rob's ""Life Story"", G-Dep pulls through on his first CD. G-Dep has an awkward but interesting flow that sounds really good with the production from the Hitmen. Some of the better tracks on the record are ""Special Delivery"", ""Danger Zone"", ""Let's Get it"", ""I am"", and ""One Way"". There is really no bad track on this record. Guest artist include Kool G Rap, Rakim, Bad Boy's Shyne, Kain, Loon, Black Rob, P. Diddy, Carl Thomas, and Joe Hooker. There is even ""Let's Get it rmx"" as a bonus track. The only reason this got 4 stars is because three tracks on the record were on P. Diddy's ""The Saga Continues"". In my opion, P. Diddy should have used these tracks on either his album or Dep's but not both. Other than hearing the same tracks this CD is a great start for G-Dep."
2,"OTHER THAN A FEW SONGS, THIS ALBUM IS WHACK!!!","I FIRST HEARD G-DEP WHEN I WAS WATCHING MTV2, HIS SONG EVERYDAY. I GOTTA ADMIT, THE SONG WAS PRETTY DEEP AND HIS FLOW WAS INTERESTING. SO I BOUGHT THE CD...BAD MISTAKE!!!I GOTTA ADMIT, AFTER LISTENING TO THE FIRST FEW TRACKS (INTRO,EVERYDAY,CHILD OF THE GHETTO, AND SPECIAL DELIVERY), I WAS LIKE THIS ALBUM IS HOT!!! MAN, BUT LISTENING TO THE REST, THE ONLY OTHER TRACK I LIKED WAS LET'S GET IT...EVERYTHING ELSE WAS WACK!!!IF I RATED THE ALBUM BASED ON THOSE 5 TRACKS(4 SONGS), I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS!!! BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM WAS PATHETICALLY MEDIOCRE...AS I SAID, THOSE 4 SONGS ARE RAW, I LOVE EM...BUT THE REST OF THE CD MAKES ME WANNA THROW-UP!!! DOWNLOAD THOSE 4 SONGS, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM..!!!"
2,Fell Short,First experience with Mahavishnu. Bought based on past John McLaughlin recordings. Can't state that I enjoyed what was offered here. Too bad as I was looking forward to expanding my McLaughlin library.
3,"Not Bad But Then, You Could Buy Birds of Fire Instead ....","The Mahavishnu Orchestra, ApocalypseThe Mahavishnu Orchestra, Visions of the Emerald BeyondMahavishnu II was nowhere as good as MI, but it had its good points in this inaugural album, most notably the pristine of electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. McLaughlin still generates the heat but sounds like he is recycling more forceful work from earlier albums. The drumming, bass and keyboards are unexceptional but not notable. There is a pretty vocal solo by keyboardist Gayle Moran on ""Smile of the Beyond."" All in all, there's too much recycled in this album, the musicians (Ponty and McLaughlin excepted) are mediocre at best, and the Buddhist propagandizing seems egregious. But at least it's better than the next album, Visions of the Emerald Beyond, which has almost nothing to recommend it, except for its moments of ersatz funk (""Cosmic Strut,"" ""Can't Stand Your Funk"")."
3,"Oh, well, he tried.","This was an interesting experiment which has, from time to time, its moments, and I would have liked to hear John McLaughlin attempt it again after having learned from the mistake--this time with a better band, more inspired compositions, and no embarrassing vocals.About the band: Gayle Moran is fairly worthless as a keyboardist. Michael Walden is a shameless Billy Cobham imitator. Ralphe Armstrong is (here) a brash nineteen-year-old anxious to show off his chops--everyone has to start somewhere, but I'd prefer a more mature, restrained player. Jean-Luc Ponty was apparently John McLaughlin's first choice for the original Mahavishnu Orchestra, but he got lucky and stumbled upon Jerry Goodman instead."
5,Unique artistry,"This work really pushes the envelope of musical expression and challenges asumptions of jazz and fusion. Real pioneering stuff, but also very compelling and often beautiful. It just works. It's not the best Mahavishnu record, and not the one to get if you are getting your first or second, but if you are a Mahavishnu fan this album should be an essential part of your collection."
5,Masterpiece,"This collaboration with Michael Tilson Thomas is brilliant and the impetus to the term ""fusion"" - classical/jazz/rock, and is the jazz fusion enthusiast's must have for admirers of this short lived genre. Mahavishnu O exhibits the apex of musical genius in any and all classes, range and scope of instrumentality in an era that defines the stretching of one's musical psyche to its boundary-free limits. J. McLaughlin is a genius."
2,Tales from Apocalyptic Oceans??,"I was rather surprised by the mostly glowing reviews this disk has received here. I've been a Mahavishnu fan for ages, but never bothered to buy this disk until a few weeks back when I was able to pick it up for $6 at the Tower Records bankruptcy sale. While quite audacious in its ambitions, it doesn't hold a candle to any of the other early 70's Mahavishnu releases, including Visions of the Emerald Beyond. In fact, for some reason it reminds me of another ambitious, but ultimately flawed album from around that time, ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" by Yes. Both albums have their moments, but both also have some very weak moments that render the overall listening experience a bit burdensome."
4,Winning Combination,"This release featruing the 2nd Mahavishnu group with orchestrations is a winning combination. Some of the strongest and finest Michael Walden playing from this period. John McLaughlin is playing at the highest level and Jean Luc Ponty is a wonderful addition to the group. The only drawback are the vocals, which tend to take this music from the spiritual element to Broadway. I've never understood why opening a can of peas can inspire song and dance."
4,He's back!,"This is a solid offering and I'm glad to see Jeff back. My favorite song is ""I Should Have Told You"" - just a gorgeous song. If you love Jeff Healey, I don't think you'll be too disappointed in this album. If you've never heard his version of ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", do a search on Amazon for it. It's amazing as well and my favorite Healey tune!"
3,Not as good as See the LIght and Hell to Pay,"Great talent, great guitar player, but this is not his best album. First buy See the Light and later Hell to Pay. These are his best records."
3,Why no Beck.,"In response to the previous comment...Rumour has it that Jeff Beck never made it into the movie because Bowie didn't like the pants that he wore than night, and this being the soundtrack, the performances never made it there either."
2,be careful what you get,I originally order this product and was dismayed to find that the sheeting insidewere vvarious sizes. Some large enough as the bow stated others too small to be of any use. Thankfully Amazon was great with making this purchase right.
1,Tape isnt Sticky,"Plastic sheet is OK BUT the tape isnt sticky on both sides, and is not very sticky on the one side.We're going to the hardware store to buy some double-sided tape."
1,He deserves better,"This new Victor Herbert is a disaster. The soloist is bad and destroys Romany Life. Her other songs aren't much better. Most of the vocal music was written with a chorus in mind. No chorus. Over half the vocal selections are mutilated. 2/3rds of Kiss Me Again is gone, about 1/2 of Moonbeams cannot be found, the second verse of A Kiss in the Dark is among the missing, etc. Thine Alone was written as a duet. Molly was written for a tenor. They are sung by a soprano. Herbert wrote so much music beautiful music but onl;y his most famous can be found here. Three or four orchestral selections are all that can be recommended. Until John McGlinn or Richard Bonynge realize that Herbert once existed he is in trouble. Naxos and Brion are not the answer."
2,Mayer needs an editor!,"The scope of this book is fantastic. I wanted to enjoy it, but Mayer plays too fast & loose with the facts. His descriptions of banking principles is muddy, leaving me to wonder if he's a sloppy writer, a bad economist, or so presumptuous to think his readers all have finance PhD's and don't need clear explanations. Among his factual errors: He mistakenly put Citicorp's card processing center in Fargo, North Dakota (instead of Sioux Falls, SD) and Reno. First Chicago was bought by National Australia Bank; it did not merge with Michigan National. Midlantic was bought by PNC, not City National of Cleveland. What happened to editors?"
4,"Fascinating insight into the ""modern"" ways of banking.","Martin Mayer gives the reader a very thorough and insightful perspective of today's financial industry. A must read for everyone who wants to be up to date in the financial services industry, its risks, challenges and disasters, it equally well serves the outsider. Mayer's writing is full of anecdotal accounts of recent events in banking, making this a very pleasant read. His authority in the field is quite obvious and the picture that he paints of current developments in banking leaves plenty food for thought"
5,Very useful.,"I just got hired as the Webmaster for a large .COM financial services firm and wanted to give myself a crash course on the history of banking as well as the various elements related to modern financial services. I found the book to be clear, concise, and very well written. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of banking or financial services in general."
3,"Direct, insightful and a good read - if you're a Yank","With its intimate understanding of the personalities, politics, institutions and technology of contemporary American banking, this is a good read.But if you are looking for a broad view of contemporary global finance, the insights are much more limited although the sections on Trading and Derivatives are useful.International readers can get much amusement from the descriptions of the primitive U.S. payment and cheque clearing systems."
5,Enjoyable to read and packed with excellent information,"Excellent book on modern day banking industry, extremely informative with lots of information, but easy to digest even for those who just wanted to learn a little more about the business.It is well written and easy to understand overall. Making it unexpectedly enjoyable."
2,Lacks too Much for a Box Set,"Too many key cuts are missing from this collection, and far too many non-essential tracks are in their stead. Absent are ""Daybreaker,"" ""It's Over,"" ""Confusion,"" ""Last Train to London,"" ""The Diary of Horace Wimp,"" ""I'm Alive,"" ""All Over the World,"" and ""Calling America."" The two cuts from the flop film ""Xanadu"" are sorely missed, as the soundtrack to the movie is a difficult find. Three CDs is too many, since a single or at most, a double-CD collection would have covered all the AM & FM hits easily. This box set is not worth the price, and fans will be better off finding an import, or buying the ""Greatest Hits"" CD and filling in the gaps with the original LPs."
4,Midnight Blue,"ELO released the three disc set Afterglow on June 15, 1990. The three disc set includes hits mixed in with album tracks and rarities. The box comes with a booklet and each disc has it's own letter on it: first disc E second disc L and third O. It really isn't a bad collection and has selections from the first couple of albums which is quite nice. However, it does feel like it falls a little short and could've been better. The album Eldorado gets somewhat stiffed and there's no Fire On High. I think part of the problem here is that they had to make room for the rarities and unreleased cuts which are mostly from the Secret Messages sessions. Secret Messages was originally planned as two lp set and quite a few of those end up here. While nice, this also gives the box a disproportionate amount of songs from this era. This box would've worked a bit better had they made it a four cd set. Perhaps with three for the released stuff and one for the unreleased stuff with more rarities."
3,It would be Fantastic if only ... Fire On High,"Sorry, I think this compilation is excellent, but how can you put together such a collection and simply leave out ""Fire On High""? Go figure."
3,"Afterglow: Almost there, but not quite.","""Afterglow"" is a fairly good collection. It certainly is well-documented and lush-sounding. I just wish it had ""Fire on High,"" ""It's Over,"" and ""Calling America."" The previously unreleased tracks on Disc 3 are interesting, if not essential. Somehow, a big double-disc set with the exclusions mentioned above being added on with judicious track-cutting would have been better. Not too badly done though. The music reminds me of those summers on the beaches of Cape Cod."
4,"3 CDs, Many Memories","I'll never understand why Jeff Lynne doesn't get the same credit that Elton John and Billy Joel do, considering how essential the ELO sound was to 1970s radio. Lynne is a good songwriter, and as a producer created tasteful mixes - which is quite a feat when you consider how difficult it can be to find the right balance between strings, synths, and drums. Afterglow is a balanced view of ELO's career, from Lynne's early loud art-rock, to the polished Beatleoid pop most of us think of when we hear ELO's name, to later material that's mostly unfamiliar. I think it's unreasonable to expect a boxed set to be a ""complete works collection"" and although I would have liked to see a few of my personal favorites in the collection (such as Mr Kingdom), I'm totally satisfied with Afterglow as is. If you enjoy 1970s pop rock, late-period Beatles, or just want to see what can happen when you combine classical textures with rock n' roll, you'll enjoy at least part of this collection."
3,It wasn't at all bad.,"Remember, this was made ten years ago, for music that was recorded between 15 and 30 years ago. The technology wasn't there to make this a true ""definitive"" ELO collection in terms of remastering. This is better and worse than Flashback. It has more cuts from Secret Messages, but it lacks the sound quality of the Jeff Lynne 3-pack! I think the best thing to do is combine Afterglow with Flashback, add a few cuts from Armchair Theatre, toss out some of the chaff, and BOOM, there's an ELO collection! I keep the ""O"" CD (the pink one, for those of you in Rio Linda) in my office CD-ROM. When I get bored, I close my door, fire up ""Hello My Old Friend"" and just enjoy!"
2,mmmmm,I don't know how this product will work. I only had it for two days.I hope it will work.I like it
5,This is one of those rare cd's where every song is awesome!!,"I first heard this group during the movie ""American Pie"" and fell in ""love!!"" Went to the music store and bought the cd ""Eyewitness"" that very same day...every song is awesome! I love the lyrics and music...This is one cd that gets played every day!!"
3,GIV'EM A CHANCE,"I FIRST SAW THEM AT A GREEN DAY CONCERT.THERE MUSIC MAKES ME SMILE.I SENT THERE TAPE TO ENGLAND A RELATIVE WANTED TO HERE THEM.SHE TOOK IT TO A GAY BAR AND THEY LOVED IT.MY FAVORITE TAPE BY THEM IS TITLED UNDRESSED.MY SISTER LIKES JAMES BONDAGE AND GROOVY UNDERWEAR.WE LISTEN TO THERE MUSIC BECAUSE ITS FUN,EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT GAY.SO LISTEN,LAUGH AND ENJOY."
5,Be creative with these,"I use them with nightcrawlers. One slipped over the hook and a few inches up the line, thread a nightcrawler on the hook and then snug down the rubber egg back to the hook. Provides bouyency for the worm w/o needing to blow it up. Also gives some color and smell to attract. I found an egg in the stomach as I cleaned a fish so I know they'll eat em. I use a combo red/orange color...works for me. I can easily see them working well with a streamer or large fly on a fly rod or with mono 6-7 feet behind a clear water float. They can be reused if treated with some care. I only use one at a time so a small jar will last quite a while, maybe several fishing seasons."
4,Great remote for outdoor lighting,"I purchased this remote to turn my landscape lighting on in the backyard. It is nice that you can turn the lights on from the actual unit, or use the remote. It also looks like if in the future I need to add another receiver to turn something else on (ie a fountain), I can control them both from one remote unit.My only gripe about this product is that the range is actually pretty short. It appears that the range is more like 50ft, not 100ft."
5,The Best,I find the CD really good I am still sort of hooked on the first one but this one has such good songs. It also sent me searching for other CD's like this Wow This Music is the Best by far!
4,Virgin produces another winner!,"Though not as good as the original, of course, still good in the 'Moods' tradition. At first I was a bit put out by having repeats from Instrumental Moods, but when I found the repeat tracks were different mixes, I was satisfied. Enigma's T.N.T. for the Brain would probably have been a better choice than Beyond the Invisible, but the latter is enjoyable nonetheless."
4,Favorite Of The Bunch,"This collection of Pure Moods CDs started with this CD and was definitely good enough to justify the rest of the entries in the series. These CDs start by taking pop songs, remaking them into semi-new age songs and then collecting them with other new age songs. They're nice and relaxing and just edgy enough to keep mainstream folks interested. This second entry into the bunch is my favorite since the new age stuff is still mainly upbeat and strikes the right balance between pop and new age."
1,Nowhere near as good as the first,"Not bad, but not Pure Moods I, either. With the first Pure Moods, each song I listened to transported me somewhere, or brought back a pleasant memory. The songs on Pure Moods II left me with a feeling that no effort was put into its compilation. If there is a Pure Moods III, and I hope there is, I trust more effort will go into it."
4,Pure Moods but not throughout,"The first Pure Moods was wonderful collection of sensual and easy listening new age music. The second addition is as well but some songs do not feature the mood perfection of Volume 1. Sonds like Breezin, Life in a Northern Town and Chariots of Fire hinder the calmness and musicality of the other tracks. For the most part, the collection of songs is impeccable except the handful of weak songs (mentioned above) that keep this volume below its original."
3,Get the original!,"Although I do like a few songs on this one, it pales in comparison to the first one."
3,Not as good as the original.,"What exactly is the point of putting tracks from the original Pure Moods on this? Though this CD has some great tracks, many have already been released on a thousand-and-one other compilation CDs of this kind. Not terrible, but the follow-up to one of the greatest CD compilations ever released should surely be better than this. Hopefully there'll be a Pure Moods 3 which will return to the high quality of the first."
4,Soothing Music,"This is a good CD with a variety of songs, each with their unique sound. Pure Moods 2 continues the trend from PM 1. I can not say the same for PM 2 and 4 but that's a different story. The best songs on this CD are1. Mummers' Dance (Excellent)2. Montezuma3. The Cradlesong (Excellent)4. Nightingale - Yanni (Excellent)5. Life in a Northern Town - The Dream Academy6. Zarabanda (Saraband) - Adiemus7. Euphoria (Firefly) - Delerium9. Teardrop - Massive Attack10. Theme from Harry's Game - Clannad15. Beyond The Invisible (Excellent)16. Mystic's Dream - Loreena McKennitt"
2,Pure Moods starts going down hill with this CD,"I am a big fan of the first of the first Pure Moods CD, so when I heard that a second one was coming out, I got it. Well, do yourself a favor and pass on the this CD. A lot the music on the disc can't even be consider New Age. ""Life in a Northern Town"" is a good song,but new age? I don't think so. Just buy the first Pure Moods because its the best and don't waste your money the others."
3,Not as good as Pure Moods 1,"This is a classical example of what happens with follow-up albums. I'm not saying this album is horrible, but nothing can compare to the first Pure Moods album. There are a lot of beautiful songs on this album, such as Nightingale by Yanni and of course the Mummers' Dance by Loreena McKennitt."
3,No where near as good as the first...,"I thought that pure moods I was and still is amazing. I feel so relaxed by listening to it, it is wonderful. Although Pure Moods II is good, it can not compaire to the first. I must say, that I love the song ""Life in a Northern Town"", it reminds me of being a small child and I do not know why. It is a wonderfull feeling and I recomend this CD to anyone who needs to relax."
4,"Not as good as the first, but still a hit!","I loved listening to Pure Moods and when I heard there was a sequal I was thrilled. A few of the songs were a bad choice but the others make up for them.The CD is still a wonderful stress relaxer and I recommend it for anyone looking for an ""escape""."
2,Just like the movies...the sequel will always bomb,"What??? No Enya?? I loved the first Pure Moods, but this CD was just thrown out for us suckers to gnaw on after wanting more from the first CD. What tacky marketing strategy! I should try to do that at my job."
5,Even Better Than The First!!!,"I thouroughly enjoy this CD every time I opo it into my player. Loreena McKennitt's beautiful voice, Enigma's eerie sounding songs, and Yanni's piece all equal one great buy: Pure Moods II. Plus, the cover is really pretty!! But if you've ever seen commercials for the movie Ever After: A Cinderella Story--(the one with Drew Barrymore) the CD's first song is playing in the background!!! It's so relaxing and you should definitely buy it if you are human and get stressed...it's perfect for that!!"
2,Yuppie Elevator Music,"This is a mix of different styles of music, with a slight emphasis on Celtic. Dream Academy is out of place in this, and the album get pretty sleepy towards the end of its gargantuan 77+ minute length. Overall a less inspired mix than Pure Moods I, rates about a 6 on the Kitaro scale, or the equivalent of taking an over-the-counter sleeping aid. If you want a similar concept done far better, check out Spirits of the World."
4,Not bad,"Pure Moods 2 is not as good as the original Pure Moods and not as goods as #3 in this series however it is not bad and has some worthy tracks. ""Euphoria"" (Firefly) by Delerium is excellent as well as ""Teardrop"" by Massive Attack and ""Beyond the Invisible"" by Enigma and these track alone make it worth it. If you are looking for some other great CD's, try Delerium's ""Karma"", Digital Moodz ""Levitation"" & ""Metamorphosis"" and Conjure One's ""Extraordinary Way""."
3,Not bad,"It takes a lot to beat the first CD, but this one comes close. There is a nice variety of songs and they're great to listen to."
4,Never disappointed with Pure Moods cd's..,We own nearly all of the Pure Moods cd's and haven't been disappointed yet. Song choices soothe the mind and soul and bring a peaceful environment to our home when played..
3,Not the greatest Kootnz has written,"The book was very intriguing for the first 20 and last 50 pages, but the middled seemed to lose the reader in meaningless information. The antagonist of the story, Roy, was a great character. Pay close attention to him because you can never tell if you love him or hate him. Koontz did a great job with the characters in that aspect. The story line seemed to lack in something but it was an all around average book."
3,"Mike Crow ""voices in The Night""","The book I read was called ""The Voice In The Night."" It was about a boy named Colin and his best friend named Roy. Colin is about five feet twelve inches. Roy is alt stronger than Colin. Once they start telling eachother more about their lives Roy reveals something so outrageous Colin can't believe him.Since Colin refuses to believe him. Roy feels compelled to do it again.It takes place six miles out of town in a junkyard where no one is around. When Colin and ROy get into a argument about what Royt is trying to do things get very ugly. Since I don't want to give the ending of this book away I'll let you read it."
1,Can you spell Boring?,OK. Let me see here. This book was boring. Was also boring. And I can't forget to say that it was boring. And not to metion it's boringness. But overall this book was B-O-R-I-N-G. It should of been called STRANGERS:The book that will bore you to death.
2,"This book is pretty good, but lacks install and cfg. details","This book is pretty good, but lacks install and cfg. details"
2,Awful Film - made it would seem by College Students,"Why on earth a very talented actor like Paul Rudd would appear in an improvised college student style ""B"" Movie is beyond me ! It could have been tolerable if it had'nt been for the appalling quality of the picture quality - it was like watching a damaged VHS tape / not what you expect in 2007 on DVD - not a funny film either with the black brother in the movie using an obsenity every 2 nd word / i would love to know what sort of brothers they were ?? Not recommended unless you like to watch a students film project !!"
1,Garbage,"I cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we've seen in films like ""baby boy"". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don't know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house.There are a few scenes where the characters are running around without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, ""what was all that excitement about?"""
4,My Sassy Girl,"I love this movie, but the dvd menu isn't in english. I had to play around a little bit with the menu options to find the option for english subtitles. I tried looking for the english dub, but I'm not sure it has one, at least I couldn't find it. But to me, it's ok, subtitles or dubbed, I still love this movie."
3,Feel Complete Different,"What happen to the songs in My Sassy Girl?The Korea or Japanese song made the movie feel weird.Where's the English song?over all, the movie was rated ok cause the change of song."
2,SO SAD!!!! Not the movie... but this DVD,"My Sassy Girl is one of the best Korean movies ever done, it is an important jewel in Asian cinema. The first time I saw it was in Korea visiting some friends from there, I enjoyed the movie and the story really struck me hard so I decided to buy the DVD from Amazon when I got home (In Korea they don't sell US region movies)... the DVD is censored, actually they took away a lot of important and funny scenes from the film. I'm not judging the movie, is a must see for everyone; but the fact they re-edited the movie for the Chinese / US version is a big failure!!!"
2,I love the movie...,"I was under the impression that I was buying the Korean version. When I actually got my purchase I found that the cover was not at all the cover pictured and it wasn't what i bought. Yes, it was the right movie, but it was in complete mandarin. I love love love love love the movie, though. I was not very happy. -_-"
3,early delivery good for gift-giving,"i haven't watched the movie, nor do i want to. it was on my cousin's wishlist for xmas. it got delivered a lot sooner than i expected, which is an incredibly nice surprise! so i am very happy that i bought from here."
5,romantic comedy for haters of romantic comedy,"I agree with the other critics who don't like romantic comedy but enjoyed this one. I loved this movie. I rented it twice and then decided to buy it because Kim's Video here in NYC closed down and the chain video stores don't carry this stuff too much. I hate romantic comedy but I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!My wife on the other hand, who likes romantic comedy, thought it was ""OK"". She thought the main female character role was a little exaggerated in her 'sassiness'."
5,This is one of the golden films that stands out in an era of media.,"As I am not such a fan of romantic movies, I had no idea what to expect in this movie. Then, there came a day to watch it and so I did. I was struck. Not only was it the most romantic thing I ever saw, it was one of the funniest, sweet movie. Nowadays I still don't like romance too much but My Sassy Girl was different for me. It remains one of my most favorite today.And for the English remake, I really did not like it as it felt like almost any other common romance films. I felt the directer (an amateur by the way) rushed the storyline and he made the environment so gloomy and the atmosphere lonely. However, its straight release to DVDs also explain the failure of the film project."
2,Censored version,This version has more than 5 minutes of cut scenes and poor sound quality (mono).Has good image quality but does not fill the entire screen of a widescreen tv...sad...
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting the blue part of the foam to rather firm and supportive, and the white part to be soft. I intended to use this cushion in the vertical orientation, to act as a back support when sitting on the ground. In fact, the picture that comes in the wedge cushion package shows an adult sitting upright on the floor, leaning against the cushion, and the cushion is supporting her back.That picture is essentially false advertising. The reality is that the blue part of the foam is as soft as the white part, and cannot support an adult leaning on it. The cushion squishes down so badly, there is almost no back support. The only way it could work in the vertical position is if there was already a vertical support surface to lean against.Use in the horizontal position works OK, although I don't intend to use it that way.I'm tempted to return it, but too lazy to go through the hassle."
3,Good Quality but not for a stomach sleeper,"Curved sides increased comfort however for a stomach sleeper, it was hard to stay up on this foam during sleep. If used for something other than sleeping, it works great. If you must be elevated during sleep, look for help elsewhere, like an adjustable bed if you can afford it."
1,Nowhere near the first!,"The first CD created by the Taliesin orchestra was a lovely rendition of Enya's work, with wonderful instrumentals. This CD falls far short of their mark. With the exception of Bodicea, not one of the tracks comes even close to matching the feel or sound of Enya's work. Orinoco Flow was worth buying, but I would advise everyone to steer clear of this CD, it is not worth considering"
3,"Good, but lacking in Enya's style","Well, to begin with, I love Enya. She is the coolest, and this album isn't too bad a tribute to her. However, one of the singers is a rather horrible replacement for Enya's light, soothing voice. I especially loved the variated Ebudae because of the strings used in place of the drums in the original song. Carribbean Blue wasn't too bad either, and Evacuee was almost as moving as Enya's. I rated it 3-star because it just couldn't add up to Enya's exceptional talent."
2,Only if you really like elevator music,"I was very disappointed with this album. I am very familiar with Enya's work and enjoy the fact that it is soothing without putting one to sleep. Unfortunately ""Maiden of Mysteries"" crossed the line and managed to make Enya boring. I will give them an ""E"" for effort, but overall the album failed in it's mission to offer viable reworks of Enya's beautiful melodies. I'll just pull out ""Memory of Trees"" one more time..."
5,I liked it.,"I liked it a lot. I don't own any of Enya's albums; this album stands on its own merits. The vocals are imaginative and refreshing, the arrangements well done. I especially liked the use of musical idioms from jazz, blues, gospel. The textures are rich and varied."
1,Taliesin Orchestra Has Strayed,"A major disappointment! Purchased this based on the outstanding first orchestral of Enya's music in Taliesin's ORINOCO FLOW. The banshee background vocals and the 'pop' beat literally mutilate most of the cuts in this album. Taliesin Orchestra knows how to make beautiful music - a la FORBIDDEN FOREST and ORINOCO FLOW. When they did ANTHEM they started to stray from their best...and now it has been carried over to Enya's music. The best way to honor Enya's music is to use the orchestra to express the mood and flow of her music...or have Enya herself sing her songs with a full orchestra. Get rid of the background banshee vocalists! While imitation maybe the sincerest form of flattery, this neither imitates or flatters. Hopefully Taliesin Orchestra will revert to their former selves and bring us more quality music."
3,How THIS Puts Enya to Shame!,"Taliesin's tribute to Enya was wonderful orchestra music that made it EARN the title ""Orinoco Flow"". But THIS is simply terrible, especially the back-up vocals! Somewhat the orchestration isn't so bad at all - which makes me willing to cling on to this album - but, argh, the female vocals in most of the tracks are but drowned meeks compared to Enya's! What do they think they're doing - forcing their voices to pay TRIBUTE to a diva like Enya puts the latter in a great deal of shame. If they wanna do something, they'd better do it well and RIGHT! What with all the ""uh, uh, uh...!"" from those girls! Simply pathetic!"
1,Grating and Misleading,"After having heard the Orinocco Flow tribute, I was expecting another great album. Instead, the only ""great"" thing about this was my disappointment.They redid the timing, and it just jars. The vocals are done by, seemingly, hacks and amateurs. I've listened to this cd several times to give it a chance to grow on me. It hasn't.I dislike it enough to not even add it to my itunes library. I am now going to preview, thoroughly, all future Tribute Albums by the Taliesin Orchestra..."
2,Why?,"Quite simply, I can't believe that Enya would let the integrity of her original, highly orchestral classics be ""interpreted"" by anyone, much less another orchestra. It's pointless, ridiculous, and the quality is light years removed from Enya's work. I hate to think that her ego is so enormous that she thinks her work could and SHOULD be vandalized. This is like a parody of Enya...not a tribute. Enya is a tribute unto herself for heaven sakes...that's the whole point of her music. This album is MUZAKKKKKK to the Nth Degree!What a thoroughly unoriginal cash-in on another artist's hard work. Maybe one of Enya's poorer relatives in in Taliesin orchestra, and that's why this atrocity was created."
5,Excellent Book,One of best Java books I've seen. Networking and AWT sections were very understandable. I hope it is update for JDK 1.1
3,Not a bad CD.,I think this one is judged a little to hard by critics. It contains 11 tracks which I would judge this way: 5 good songs. 3 average songs. 3 terrible songs. Lets be honest most Cd's can't promise even that. If you base every album Bowie releases by his 1970's standards then I suppose you will always be disappointed. Just listen to it on its own and you'll find that its a pretty good listen.
3,Bowie's underrated album,"Never Let Me Down is bad. It's not good. But it's not CRAP. Sure, it's 80's pop, but it's stronger than Iggy Pop's Blah Blah Blah, and the title track is one of the most underrated songs Bowie ever wrote. Sure, compared to any of his 70's albums it's trash, but compared to Let's Dance or Black Tie White Noise it's very good. Bowie could have done better, however, and he did with the advent of Tin Machine two years later."
2,You've Just Let Me Down,"It is actually very sad to see the most creative and inovative musician since the Beatles pander to the mainstream is such an undignified fashion. Despite that there are more decent tunes on this than on the earlier ""Tonight"": ""Time Will Crawl"" is one of his strongest cuts from the eighties; the Lennon-esque title track is simply a great pop song; and ""Glass Spider"" seems to be a return to form, harking back to the opening track of the fantastic ""Diamond Dogs"" album. Aside from these three tracks, however, the rest of the album is a pretty dispensable affair. The first half manages to keep itself above water, but the second half is blandness personifies - eighties pop at its worst. The bonus tracks on the re-issue make the album slightly more worthwhile. Although ""Girls"" and ""Julie"" aren't much cop, ""When The Wind Blows"" is a criminally underrated Bowie song. So, on the whole, the album isn't much good but the decent tracks would've made a great EP."
1,Bollocks,"Bowie himself admitted that he was in a creative slump when he cobbled together this atrocity, and I wholeheartedly agree. Gone is the brilliance of ""Scary Monsters"" or even the proficient if superficial pop of ""Let's Dance"": instead we have an uneasy combination of flatuent bombast and pure bland. The reissue is slightly more bearable than the original album; ""Too Dizzy"", the worst track, has been dropped. Bowie thankfully returned to making great music a few years later with Tin Machine. Too bad hardly anyone noticed."
3,Great BUT!,This is a great case but my front pocket split the seam on the bottom and I nearly lost my wallet etc. I'm a thrifty guy so I duct taped the seam and it's holding up fine . . . hopefully this was just a single problem and not with the whole line.
2,Don't let this be your first Synergy disk!,"If you want to know the ""real"" Synergy, choose another disk first - try Audion or Games. ""Experiments"" is just that - experiments in allowing an artificial intelligence program to write music (circa 1978 - hint, hint). The result is long chords with slow changes and little in the way of melodies. ""The World After April"" is the closest thing that comes to a realization a'la Larry Fast, but not by much."
5,Kenkyusha,I ordered 3 Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionaries. They were very heavy. I received the books within 4 weeks in perfect condition. I am very impressed with this service even more so that I know American Post can be very unreliable and slow.Thank you very much for your help in this matter.Jonas Moham-Wild
5,great update from a great dictionary maker/publisher,This is an update to an older product. It is very good. It is worth the money in my opinion.
5,My son has this one memorized,This is currently my 2 year old son's favorite book. He even has it memorized. He recites it when the book is nowhere in sight! The story is darling and the illustrations are just wonderful. David Kirk is so so imaginative and so so unique. I hope he does more NICE stories.
2,"Lovely illustrations, terrible message","After seeing so many positive reviews and checking out the preview available I was certain this book was going to be a great addition to my daughter's library. Yes, the illustrations are gorgeous, but the content is dominated by unexplained acts of social rejection. If your child is at an age where discussions of stereotyping and ostracism are appropriate, this book presents a teachable moment. Why is the story dominated by repeated acts of ostracism until the very last couple pages? Must an individual who is heavily stereotyped prove themselves to be harmless in order for society to recognize them and/or associate with them? Does the ending suggested by the story work in real life? Needless to say, these are discussions for most children older than 2 or 3."
3,Better than I expected it to be.,"My 13 month old *LOVES* Miss Spider, and I was getting really sick of Miss Spider's New Car (which is a great book, don't get me wrong, I was just tired of reading it 3x/night.) I went looking for the original Miss Spider's Tea Party in board book format (which you can't find, why is that?) and stumbled across this one and the ABC one. He likes both of them, I slightly prefer this one because frankly it's shorter. The artwork is still the classic David Kirk Miss Spider traditional stuff, not the computer-animated from the TV series stuff. And if you know the original Tea Party story, it's an abbreviated version of that, so it's kind of fun to see where they go with it for the Counting. So all in all, a decent alternative."
5,It's very colorful and really captivates the childs interest,"My child is just over 1 year old and constantly brings us books to read. She has dozens from which to choose, but clearly prefers this book over the others. I believe it's because of the brilliant colors and vivid contrasts in the pictures. I also like the fact that it's a board book, so she can't tear the pages. I'd like to see the other titles in a board book as well."
4,Sweet book about preconceptions and counting,"Miss spider just wants to have tea but everyone is afraid until she helps a friend out and then everyone wants tea with her, all while counting. Sweet story."
5,Captivating art work - counting made fun!,"My 8 month old son loves to look at this book. The board version is great for us because he likes to turn the pages. All the other books get pushed aside when he sees ""Miss Spider"". I am quite anxious to get the other ""Miss Spider"" books for him! ""Miss Spider"" is family!"
5,Nice pretty everyday watch,"A clear, easy-to-read dial with Indiglo so you can read it at night or in low light. I was worried that the expansion band would be too tight but it fits my larger wrist. I like the gold tone band edged with silver tone as an everyday watch that will go with any other jewelry I choose. Keeps good time, is comfortable and pretty--what else could you ask of a watch."
4,Like it But a Little too big,This watch was a little too big for my wrist which is 6 1/2 inches. It fits my daughter perfectly though so I gave it to her and she loves it. The band got worn out after two years so I had to get her another.Timex Women's T2H491 Easy Reader Two-Tone Stainless Steel Expansion Band Watch
4,Good watch,"Easy to read watch. Band was too large for my thin wrist, jeweller easily took out links so now perfect. Love the light. Quality as you would expect for price, but still good looking and functional. delivery super fast. Thank you!"
2,Battery died in less than three months--supplier problem?,"This watch is well-priced, easy to read, and versatile enough to be worn on all but dressy occasions. The band was about two links too long for my 6-1/2 in. woman's wrist (medium-large), but nothing I couldn't live with.Unfortunately, about 2-1/2 months after I received it, it stopped working--or rather, it stopped dead, then started again when I shook it a little, and then after another day, stopped completely, which suggests that the battery was old when it arrived in my mailbox.2-1/2 months out, it's too late to return it to Amazon, even though this is clearly a problem with the supplier Amazon got it from. I've purchased watches at this price level before and they've worked for approximately the year they should work before needing another battery. Since this one cost about $34 and I'd have to pay $15 to replace the battery, I might as well buy another watch--but not a Timex, this time, and not from Amazon."
2,Didn't work for long,"I got one of these after misplacing a similar one that I bought at Wal-Mart. I found the Wal-Mart one and it's working fine, but this one didn't work long. I like the style, and the expansion bracelet fits my big wrist well, but I've put two new batteries in it and it still doesn't work. I see that one of my options is to return it, so I probably should do that."
2,Women's Timex Watch T2H491,"The easy reader Timex watch is a great time piece; nice size, definitely easy to read, no extra big bells and whistles. BUT: the description did not indicate the expansion band was extra long (which means I can't use the expansion band as it is way too floppy) and the date mechanism DOES NOT work (am stuck with the ship date and it is not the current date)."
2,Not an extra long band,I am a plus sized woman so I expected the extra long expansion band to fit..... it is no longer than the average watch!!!!!!!!
3,@#$@%# You Fans!!!,"I found their treatment of the audience at the beginning very rude. They kept swearing at them, calling them ""wankers"" and such. I love Mott, but they aren't THAT good to treat fans that way. The sound quality, as mentioned already, is not too good."
4,Love it,"I love this board. Although, very heavy and a bit big to store, it is fabulous for turkeys and big meat items. Glad I ordered it."
5,"My People's Praye Book, Vol 3","Rabbi Hoffman's book, My People's Prayer Book, Vol. 3, is an exquisit addition to any Jewish library. This book, which concentrates on Psukei DiZimra, morning prayers, teaches both the experienced and neophyte person, what these particular prayers mean, their significance in the morning service and why they need to be said. All three of Hoffman's books on prayer have proved a great assett in the classroom and in my personal spiritual aspiration to learn more."
1,Not for Humans,"This product is not for humans. The seller should feel obligated to mention it is not made of ""safe sex toy"" materials and IF it could be used on humans you would not want to. If it were of safe materials that did not hold germs & bacteria it is the size you would make it for a bovine. Though I am not sure who would want to use this on an animal it certainly is made for a large one. The past customer review was kind and too forgiving. It is gigantic in proportion to a human being and could not be used by anyone who does not have a vulva and taint longer than 7+ inches with 5"" of flesh to width. I have never seen a human being this would fit on and I do not believe I ever will without world record sizes."
5,Helping you through Fed. Courts,"This book was a great help to me getting through Federal Courts in addition to my textbook. As any law student can tell you, Federal Courts or Federal Jurisdiction probably outranks civil procedure as the most dreaded class at law school. I am a firm believer in the importance of the subject and this book was invaluable to me in class and in work. If you have a legal problem that will involve federal litigation, this book is a must have. It makes a subject that I often believe is as clear as reading tea leaves a little easier."
3,Not much difference.,"The product separated not long after I received it in the mail. Water came out of it after several uses. I had to shake it vigorously for a minute to make it usable again.Didn't make a bit of difference in the appearance of my eyebags and circles. It's a temporary brightness after application, and that's all."
5,Great eye cream,They don't sell Dove eye cream in the stores anymore. It is better than the other ones because the titanium dioxide brightens your eye area making you look fresher and more awake.
5,Enlightening work,"Fred Alan Wolfe is an inpsired genius who has expanded the most complex ideas of his teacher and mentor, Carlos Suares, into a much easier format for learning and understanding. The use of the Alef-Bet as a chapter by chapter progression of creation into matter and matter into feeling is brilliant and authentic to the original transmission of knowledge as taught by the great mystics. I loved every minute of this work and his other books as well."
4,an adventure,"I enjoyed Jethro Junior, the story of two girls who live in the Rockies and ride their horses in the national forest. It's well-targeted at ages 9-12. I cringed at the girls' plan to jump their ranch horses over an enormous log on a slope, but the writing is satisfying and the plot realistic."
4,They are What they are.,4 locks with keys that work. They really do not look very strong. I only bought them to keep the pin that holds the receiver on and secures it to my Trailblazer. They do that and the store delivered quicker than promised.
1,"Will fit Swagman rack, but won't secure the rack.","Yes these will ""fit"" through the holes of the Swagman bike rack hooks, but they WON'T secure them. I was adujusting my bike on the rack and didn't realize that the master lock was attached; I squeezed the sliding hook and guess what? The thing still can be removed.These master locks will easily fit through the holes, but they are not thick enough to prevent the mechanism from releasing from the ratchet style post.Check it out. These locks are more like a novelty lock you would but on a childs toy box."
3,"Great Locks, Questionable Quality","I ordered these locks because the size fits most hard plastic gun cases holes (for locks). It's nice that there's 4 and they're keyed alike. However, this item *only* comes with TWO keys.After a few months of use, the plastic housing on 3 of 4 locks are cracking at a corner. The three that are cracking are all cracking in a similar fashion - from top to bottom along the edge of the lock. I'm going to contact Master and see what they'll do."
4,Fun despite flaws,"The plot sometimes gets muddled, but the film is fun and the main actors (Spacey and Wu) are really good."
1,Kevin Spaced this one,"Often we'll watch a movie just because we know and like the talent in the movie. Unfortunately, it appears Kevin Spacey just needed some income when he made this dog. Don't bother."
3,"Funny, but lags","The trailer for this movie looked fantastic, but was very misleading. This is not an action movie and the movie really slows to a crawl in the middle. But Kevin Spacey did a great job acting. Good to see once, but has no value for repeate views."
2,so so..,"beng a comic book fan/superhero movie fan, I thought this would be great having Kevin Spacey in it. as it did have some good parts and some good laughs i thought it was somewhat boring and not as entertaining as I'd hoped."
1,crap,bad movie ..trailer was the best part of the movie watch the trailer and you have seen the best part of the film save your money...
1,A very sad affair....,"I sympathize with Ms. Scott, as it seems she believed she was doing the right thing when she wrote this book. But I have seen such overwhelming evidence to support the fact that almost all ""ritual abuse"" cases WERE indeed caused by mass hysteria and community pressure. So many individuals in these communities were forced not to appear ""weak,"" and jumped on the neighborhood bandwagon to accuse, accuse, accuse.Nothing is more horrifying than the thought of our children being in peril...but that fear sadly caused a lot of irreversible damage to many innocent people's lives in these cases.From the Salem Witch trials to the Senator McCarthy insanity to this mess, it seems that every so often the civilized world goes mad. We can learn from it...but not by reading this wrongheaded book."
1,Not needed,"When I bought the sink, Amazon suggested these clips as items that ""others also purchased"" so I figured that I would need them. The sink comes with clips of a different style, I don't know if they were for undermount or top mount service because the installer did not use either pack of clips. They attached the sink to a granite counter top with silicone adhesive and some wood blocks underneath attached to the cabinet. Save your money, don't bother buying these clips. Amazon allowed me to return them, but I did have to pay shipping."
2,Dead wrong on Waco,"If you don't take very word as ""Gospel"".. Take it for what it is. A ""Paperback Book"" that tries to cover ""Cults"". Well that is what it is.There is a lot of ""SHOCK"" thrown in along with the same ""Shocking"" writing style.Each account in this book deserves BOOKS written. Not simple headlines and writers ""Fill""."
3,Slow Reading.,This book was to detailed about the early years ofthe leaders of the cults and not detailed enoughabout the actual details of the cults itself.It left me wanting to know more....
3,2006 Dead Calendar,The usual pictures etc makes this calendar the same as previous years. A must for the dead head who has everything !!
5,Pretty amazing stuff,"For the price your getting a huge jug of fog fluid for one, this thing has lasted me at least 4 shows and im stuff currently using it. The fog is thick and great for lasers and lights of all kinds. Worth the price."
1,Avoid goHastings,If you want to throw your money in a proposition riskier than Haiti than do business with goHastings. These people are no better than telemarketers in T.J.
3,pretty good!,"Erotic music and dance, you travel to another place where love is your only consider. Enjoy Lambada..."
4,"A Good book to read for the beginner, and enjoyable for any recordist","I only went 4 star because it did not contain as much recording technical tips as I had hoped for, but I don't believe this book was written for that purpose. The book was very enjoyable and gave me a different perspective on nature recording, such as learning to listen better while in the field, choosing my locations, and some helpful tips on preparing my equipment for various situations. The CD with Bernie's narration and wonderful field recordings and mixes ,was certainly 5 Star quality!"
5,Enhanced with an accompanying 55 minute CD,"Wild Soundscapes: Discovering The Voice Of The Natural World by naturalist and soundscape recorder Bernie Krause is an engaging introduction to the wondrous world of natural soundscapes. Simple listening exercises, advice for recording natural sounds, equipment tips fill the pages of this practical, ""user friendly"", and thoroughly enjoyable guide to the ""singing"" of ants, the quiet rustle of desert sand dunes, and much, much more. Enhanced with an accompanying 55 minute CD of fascinating wildlife and wilderness audio soundscapes, Wild Soundscapes is a unique and very highly recommended addition to any personal, professional, academic, or community library Nature Studies or Out Door Recreation reference collection."
3,A 5 star and a 1 star rating in one book,"I think its important to know whats the book about: Its about nature, the sounds of nature, the spirit of field recording. Its about memories from Bernie Krause, some nice stories, its getting you into ""how to hear right"".Its not about recording technique, if you never did recording before it might help you and get you started, but if you have a little experience about field recording its not of much help, I not found only basic hints and very, very few about professional recording. So to me its a clear 5 star as its a brilliant started book and nice to read but only a 1 star book for lacking up to date technical and advanced recording aspects."
2,Very weak padlock,"When you look at the pictures, this padlock & chain combination seems rather sturdy, but I would not even use it on a bicycle.The combination mechanism itself is very poorly built, and its operation is not precise. Plus, the COMBINATION CANNOT BE CHANGED.I used this padlock on a fence and it LASTED LESS THAN A WEEK: somebody busted the barrel into tiny pieces, probably with a small hammer (actually, the combination dials came apart and that was it).This product does not deserve to bear the Master name."
2,Very weak padlock,"When you look at the pictures, this padlock & chain combination seems rather sturdy, but I would not even use it on a bicycle.The combination mechanism itself is very poorly built, and its operation is not precise.I used this padlock on a fence and it lasted about a week: somebody busted the barrel into tiny pieces, probably with a small hammer (actually, the combination dials came apart and that was it).This product does not deserve to bear the Master name."
2,Not a bargain,"As far as the vitamins and minerals in this product it's not much different from many other brands on the market. However, the dosage is. I should have read the product dosage instructions more closely because these are to be taken 3 times per day. A mere twenty day supply is no bargain."
1,Not worth the $$,"It's really nice looking...except the LARGE handle is the same color in PLASTIC. The handle in the pic is not at all what you get. It's a pear shaped thing. It's really easy to use, but for this kind of money for something you can get for $5 in another color...you would think they could give you a better handle. I paid this much because I was having a hard time finding one with this finish to match my other fixtures. I just filled out my info to return it. By the way...brushed nickel in plastic looks like puddy. And if you have a large shower head...or a rain shower head, you can't see it any way. So, I'm getting one from my local Lowes that's cheap. I'm loading a stock photo of what it looks like. It's actually more on the yellow side and the plastic looks awful next to the metal finish."
4,Solid construction but only 2 settings.,I got this in the mail today and posted pics for everyone. It is made of metal and not cheap plastic like the ones in stores. Unfortunately you can only use one shower head at a time and not both at the same time. If that doesn't matter to you then you should definitely buy it.
3,"Works great... then, it doesn't work at all","I liked this bottle warmer because my BreastFlow bottles fit well in it. And from reading other reviews, the bottle doesn't have a button at the bottom that needs to be pressed to turn it ON. So, it's ON when it's plugged in. I like it. It was working well... until today. It just stopped working. I wiggled the cable & connector around and NOTHING. We didn't even use this for 4 months! And, we only use it 2 to 3 times a week. I am so disappointed. I'd like to purchase this item again, but it may be worth trying something else. The problem is, there really isn't anything else."
3,Works but VERY slow,"Milk eventually will warm, but takes a LONG time. I normally plug it in the first thing when I go into the car. It takes 30-45 mins. Also, it doesn't have heating elements on the bottom. So the milk on the bottom of the bottle always colder."
1,Short lifespan,The warmer is able to warm up the bottle in less than 10 mins. The only limitation is short lifespan. We used less than 10 times and after which it couldn't function anymore.
2,Not worth it..,This was soo not worth it. It takes a while to heat up which was a problem for us. I honestly didn't get enough use out of it to tell you anything other than that.
2,Don't really get the point,"They can't seem to make car bottle warmers that work well. This does get warm, but takes forever to warm the bottle just like any other car warmer. Be prepared for it to take 15 mins or so."
2,Be wary,"I loved this product until it broke. I had it less than 2 months and used it less than 5 times. Now, it won't heat up anymore."
2,Does not fit all bottles,I cannot comment on how long it takes for the warmer to use since it won't fit my daughter's bottles. It's too large. The bottles we use are too narrow for the product so it doesn't get a snug fit. I will likely return it.
2,Not bad,Takes a long time to heat the bottle up so start warming 15 mins before a hungry baby starts crying. I wish it had a timer or a beeper because I accidentally left it on the lighter and burned it up in a week. Good tool but I found a drive thru cup of hot water a faster and easier method.
3,good in a pinch but can scald baby's milk,It works and is great in a pinch but make sure you shake the bottle every now and then so you don't burn baby's milk. The warmer gets hotter in spots and has even discolored spots on baby's bottle from over heating.
5,Best $10 I've spent so far!,"After trying the Munchkins Deluxe Auto Bottle Warmer, I was pretty much disgusted with bottle warmers in general. But, needing SOME way to warm a bottle for a picky baby while on the road, I decided to try this one, being as cheap as it was... I am totally satisfied so far! It will warm a fridge-cold bottle in approximately 15 min, so you still have to think ahead, but I've concluded that when using a travel warmer, there is no such thing as instant heat. I also like that it's compact, will fit in your cup holder, and there's no being ultra-particular about placing the bottle. Just pop it in, and soon you have a warm bottle! I would recomend this to any parent travelling! Good luck to all fellow parents... lets do our best to raise our babies to do right."
3,mom of 8,It will warm a frig cold bottle but it takes 30 min. to be warm so plan a head and you will love it
1,Not recommended!,I throw mine away! It has been plugged in my car(which was running) for about an hour and still the bottle is barely warm! My baby's bottle did not even came from the fridge! It is definitely a waste of money!
3,calentador tetero,"all fine, no hubo inconvenientes y pude recibir mi pedido satisfactoriamente.Gracias y continuen realizando sus operaciones con calidad y tratando de mejorar los tiempos de entrega...es todo"
1,Poor Product,The bottle did not even warm up after 20 minutes. The bottle did not come out of the fridge.
1,Panasonic KX-TCA 200 does NOT work with new KX-TG9392T DECT 6.0 phones,"I recently ordered the above battery backup,(not a headset as listed on the Amazon site). The description said it would fit the new 1.9Mz DECT 6.0 Panasonic model KX-TG9392T. It does NOT fit. The jack from the wall A/C adaptor(PQLV207) does not fit into the battery backup (too large)."
1,panasonic cordless phone battery back up,"This item does not do what i thought it would do.I thought if the power went off, it would automatically supply power to the phone so you would not lose all of your settings."
1,Wrong!!,I ordered this recommended power supply with the Panasonic KX-TG6582 phone. It is the wrong power supply for this phone. The plug does not fit. The correct power supply for this phone is the KX-TCA230. Amazon does not sell it and it has been back-ordered through another vendor for weeks.Can't trust amazon to recommend the correct supply. Need to confirm independently.
3,Great idea but does not work with phones made after 2006,"I missed in the item description that this unit will not work with Panasonic cordless phones made after 2006. So, check to make sure. It does not work with my KX-TG5777 unit. It should have rechargeble batteries so that they are always charged, and not have to remember to replace the alkaline batteries periodically."
1,I Wish I could have the no stars rate option for this Item,"First of all, the title of the product its not correct; this is not a handset or a headset; its a backup device taht works with alkiline batteries. But I was looking for this Item because I read at the panasonic website, this backup unit will work with my new KX-TG6702B telephone system... but its not, The plug does not fit the jack on the phone; so my recomendation its not buy this device."
1,Use Caution,Be careful when ordering this. The packaging says it works with Panasonic cordless phones excluding models prior to 2003 and model numbers KX-TG2000 and KX-TG4000. What they don't tell you is the power jack will not fit newer Panasonic Dect 6.0 telephones.
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY PHONE,"I'LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET: I WAS JUST TOLD THAT THIS PANASONIC POWER SUPPLY DOES NOT WORK WITH MY NEW PANASONIC CORDLESS PHONE SYSTEM, MODEL NO. KX-TG4031. EVEN I JUST PLACED THE ORDER 30 MINUTES AGO, IT IS ALREADY IN PROCESS AND CANNOT BE CANCELLED OR CHANGED.THE THING PROBABLY WORKS WITH CERTAIN OTHER PHONE SYSTEMS, BUT I SHALL BE STUCK WITH A USELESS BACK-UP POWER SUPPLY FOR MY PHONE'S BASE UNIT. BUYER, BEWARE!"

1,Not at all what it seems to be.,"This book was more of an analytical, case study type book than one would think. Seemed to be written for the therapists out there, and not for the layperson trying to gain insight."
4,Synthetic Revelry,"This is a far more accomplished offering than Add N To X's previous ""Avant Hard"" album. From the onset, this trio of antique synth and organic drum dabblers builds insistent grooves with a pleasantly cheesy edge. There's a well-balanced focus on both the rhythmic gains that have been made in the techno arena over the last few years and the undeniable cuteness of synth-pop tunes from several decades ago. They're also not afraid to try their hand at the vocoder, an instrument which has become all to fashionable of late."
4,cheesy peas,"The best way to describe this band is to think of the sounds of devo and daft punk thrown in a pot and jumbled up, then filtered of all their cheesiness and innocent campness.The vibes of this record bring to mind the buzzing electricity of someone sticking their fingers in an outlet socket, as the band present themselves as mischievous but dark at the same time.Open minded people who embrace diversity and originality should love this album, but it should never be taken seriously or literally as it might end up driving you insane"
3,OK.,"This album is pretty good. It still is not as good as the albums before, but it is pretty ok. Like 'Loud like nature' it isn't as much live like other ADD N TO (X). Older stuff like 'Avant Hard' and 'On the wires of our nerves' sound more straight to tape, live rock band sound. I liked that better. this is more slick, but not as bad as 'Loud like nature'."
1,Aztec Blood,This book is in no way to compared to Aztec or Aztec Autumn. It appears to been have written by a committee. It is hopeless.
1,I may change my mind but,"I started reading this book and got maybe through page 5 or 6. The writer who took over for Jennings has this annoying conceit of dropping a few Spanish words here and there and it is really really annoying. Probably thought it would give the book some flavor, but it doesn't. It just stops the flow of the story line cause he doesn't have a clue on how to do it effectively."
5,Great book.,"Being a frequent visitor to Hawaii, I loved James Michener's Hawaii. After reading Aztec Blood, I am convinced that the book does for Mexico what Michener's book did for Hawaii. Before I read the book, I never really understood the connection between the Aztecs and the modern people of Mexico. Learning about what the mestizos went through was a real eye opener. I recommend this book to anyone who loves history and adventure. It's a fun book and a real education about Mexico."
3,Not one of the Better Jennings,"I had read the first two novels in this trilogy and found the quality going down each time. Aztec was a phenomenal book, Aztec Autumn was good. I found Aztec Blood to be so-so (probably 3 1/2 stars). It centers around a mixed-breed Mestiso, who is spurned by all. He is raised by a Fray (a friar) and taught to read and write, which is forbidden to all but Spaniards. It seems like everyone he meets wants to kill him. The reader can only suspect why, until the late in the book.The book does have some elements of the prior two and that is explaining some of the ancient rituals of human sacrifice and the horrors wraught by the Spanish Inquisition.There are some interesting characters too (Mateo, Sanchez, the Healer), but in camparison to some of Mr. Jennings other books they are just not as good.I understand that this book was completed by a ghost writer after Mr. Jennings untimely death. The writer did a great job of capturing Mr. Jennings style."
4,"It looked like Jennings, it tasted like Jennings...therefor","It must be Jennings!! And even though this book was technically not written by Jennings but rather based on manuscripts found after his death, I have to say it was very very good. I felt some apprehension about reading this books for those stated reasons, but I'm glad I went ahead and read it anyway.In the third and final of the Aztec series, we get to follow the adventures and tribulations of Cristo, a mestizo (mixed blood) in now conquered New Spain. The thing I found very interesting about this book is that you are pulled back and forth between the Spanish and India culture that existed side by side, but extremely separate from eachother during the 1600's. Since Cristo is of mixed blood, he switches back and forth between being a full blooded Spaniard and an Indio beggar. The book is full of adventure, sex, torture; all the typical Jennings subjects, and does not disappoint."
5,Aztec Blood captured my attention right away.,Aztec Blood captured my attention right away. It held my interest from beginning to end.Adventure: Keeps a person thinking what is going to happen to Cristo next.Description: Fantastic. From the flicking candle in the Viceroy's dungeon cell.To a magician he witnessed in the moonlight.This book leaves the reader feeling as though they have actually witnessed the events.If I didn't know better I would think Gary Jennings was still alive and writing novels.Congratulations to the writer who picked up where Jennings left off.Aztec Blood: A great book to read.
2,Norman Mailers Ancient Evenings is better,This book is ok but in my opinion he borrowed heavily from Norman Mailers Ancient Evenings which in my opinion is a better book. This book is mediocore at best. Mr. JEnnings was no expert in the Spanish language thats for sure. It is ok if you are really into the Aztec culture.
3,Based on a normal book...,"..But on a Jennings book I would rate it lower.I have read all three books in this series as well as The Journeyor and this book fell short on so many levels. I found the historical portion to be a tedious regurge of facts designed to catch Aztec virgins up with the rest of us rather than adding any entertainment value. Aztec Blood lacked the raciness and excitement that I have come to expect from Jennings. In portions of the book I found myself paying more attention to the editing mistakes than the text. Even the reveal alluded to in the first chapters of the book was underwhelming. I finished the book, but if you are used to the usual standard of the Aztec books, you will be disappointed."
5,I just loved this one,I thoroughly enjoyed Aztec Blood over Aztec Autumn. Especially the characters: Mateo and Cristo and their adventures. I was hooked reading this series after first reading Aztec. I look forward to reading Aztec Rage and hope I am not disappointed.
2,"Not very good, but if you're a fan of the series, read it.","This book had its moments, but more misses than hits. The character is an unlikeable guy, unlike those in the previous episodes--he never really figures out who or what he is, and never really amounts to anything. I got really tired of him telling the reader that the only thing he really ever knew were guns, horses, and women. His creative references to his sexual conquests were laughable. My favorite was, ""...water the garden between her legs."" Is there a woman alive who wouldn't swoon to that reference?Rating the series from best to worst:1. Aztec2. Aztec Rage3. Aztec Autumn4. Aztec Blood"
3,Please Don't Be Misled:,"To the prospective buyer: Beware! This book was not written by Gary Jennings. It will be obvious to anyone who has read any of Mr. Jennings books. It lacks the depth and genius of Gary Jennings' writings. In fact, if you do purchase this book there is a note to the reader stating that this book was written by ""a carefully selected author using Jennings' ideas"". If that is good enough for you, then by all means you may enjoy this book. The subject matter is interesting however, one must know that it was not written by Gary Jennings."
2,Jennings' fans should skip this book.,"I have read both Aztec and Aztec Autumn and was excited to start this one. I can't say I hate the book but, I wouldn't recommend it. Read Aztec which was fabulous and if so inclined, read Aztec Autumn.While some aspects of the book were enjoyable, you can really tell this book was written by a different author. I felt like I was reading a plain romance/adventure novel instead of the great historical fiction book (i.e. Aztec) I expected.The only reason I finished the book was to find out why Cristo was being persecuted. While I had a feeling what the reason would be, I was hoping it wouldn't be that predictable.I agree with other reviewers on the editing aspects. The spanish spelling and grammar were horrible and there were simple errors that should have been caught by anyone remotely familiar with the spanish language."
5,Great ensemble,If you like saxophone music this CD is a must. These guys read the music really well and they blend together really nice. It has been along time since I have heard a sax ensemble and I was glad I came across this one. I am not usually a soprano sax fan but within the ensemble it is amazing! The overall interpretation of the group is excellent and their sound is robust! I'm not sure when this CD was cut but I hope they do another one.
2,Pilates for Christians,"I rented this w/o seeing a description. This is lead by Theresa Rowe, a blond who looks to be in her 30s in great shape outside on the grass. Lovely scenery considering it's no island or exotic location. I only skimmed this, but was pure pilates with Theresa telling you the names of the moves, minor movement direction & when to breathe by voice over. Often, the title of a passage from the Bible will show on the screen & she will hurriedly tell you that passage so she is finished as fast as possible. I'm open to religions though I don't follow any formal religion as I like a more spiritual path that can be followed by an denomination. That said, this one is not that type & did not seem relaxing or give a mind/body connection, rather a lecture while you exercise. I cannot tell you if this was a challenging or easy workout, but it is only 25 minutes.Preview: shapedbyfaith com (outside in blue shirt)"
5,Time Further Enjoyable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As Brubeck started his trend of concept albums with ""time"" associated in the title starting with Time Out, they only got better. The next album to come after this was Countdown, and that was a down home album. The first song swings so great, and Morello gives a pretty impressive brush solo on Charles Mathew before giving another one on Far More Drums. Castilian Blues later became Brubecks preferred song to feature Morello's extended drum solo in 5/4 as Far More Blues was the first and shows up here. Some other highlights from this album are, Unsquare Dance, Bru's Boogie Woogie, and Maori Blues. This album is a winner and an absolute must for jazz listeners who want a new spin or old one for that matter on modern jazz."
4,A good Don Carlo,"Overall a good Don Carlo with a few flaws: The sound is somewhat tinny and loudness is variable. MargaretPrice as Elisabetta did not have her best night: she hits the notes allright but hardly uses any piano, let alone pianissimo as would have been nice and appropriate especially in the farewell to Countess Ahremberg (""Non piangi.."") and her final aria - a bit of a disappointment by her own standard."
2,Poor Sound Quality ruins the performance,"I had high hopes for this recording of Verdi's Don Carlo, but the poor sound quality ruined my entire experience of listening to these 3-CDs. The recording sounds 'old', very old. Also because it is a LIVE recording doesn't help matters. What I find (and found) most annoying was that it didn't flow well and I was having to strain to hear the ""voices"" due to the poor sound quality of this recording. There are many better recordings of this great Opera available. I can not honestly recommend this one."
3,Only three legs working,"One of the legs to my ottoman is defective (Screw too small) and my ottoman only has three working legs. Design is fantastic in terms of size, shape, easy to open and spacious compartment from which to hold things in. Bicast leather is technically a leather but a low grade, cheaper leather that will crack over time (and does not ""improve with age"" like genuine leather). I like the fact that kids will not get injured around the house with the use of this ottoman as our coffee table. The design, functionality, and swift shipping of this product should warrant five stars; however, due to the defective leg and cheap leather material, I would give this three stars. Ships super fast though. I will try to get Amazon to replace this one with another one. This would be my last time buying bicast leather."
2,cocktail storage?,there is no storage on this item as described......very dissappointed.....the top does not hinge open.....its just a flat ottoman. desciption said it was a cocktail storage item....description is wrong.
2,Vacuum,The Turbopower Hoover vacuum has many downfalls one of which is the main filter is located in the main dirt collection cup and is unwashable. The filter is filthy and dusty after vacuuming and you are stuck with it like that as it is unwashable. My last vacuum was great and the main filter was not located in the main dust & dirt collection cup which was washable after every vacuum. I wish I would have known where the main filter was located and that it was unwashable as I would have never purchased this vacuum. I would not recommend this vacuum as the filters are unwashable and expensive.
4,SO MUCH EASIER,I WAS REALLY DELIGHTED THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. IT WIRKS SO MUCH BETTER THAN A VACUUM WITH A BAG. I WON'T GO BACK TO BAGS
4,Much better than Eureka Altima,This is a pretty good vacuum for the price. We bought this to replace the Eureka Altima we purchased just a couple of months before. The Altima is went out to the curb a couple of days after this sweeper arrived. The pre-filter is not as fine on this vacuum so more dirt gets through to the main filter. It's not a huge deal since on most value bagless units you have to clean the pre-filter and the main filter pretty regularly anyway. This TurboPower doesn't seem to lose power during sweeping or between filter cleanings which is nice (main reason Altima stunk). The extension hose and hand tool are more usable also.
4,vacums,"this vacum is a good buy and a great value. doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models, but after 50 years of vacuming, my wife now smiles a little when she vacs. that says it all. jim"
5,great watch for the price,"only have had this watch a month so i cannot speak to longevity. otherwise, the watch is best for medium to small size wrists, not heavy feeling. the watch is versatile in style and easy to read the time in light only. the links are removable w/ small screwdriver, but one side of the screws are very tiny and sometimes frustrating to remove."
5,great looking-great feeling-top quality watch,"I bought mine from Amazon at 49.99 and it is worth far more than that to me.it looks good in dress or casual.The watch is simple with no bells or whistles which means that there is less to go wrong with it.It is light on the wrist and the numbers are easy to see at any glance.This watch will be a classic and I would recommend that you buy it if you like it before it is discontinued.The second hand is red.It has fast become the only watch that i wear and I own about thirty.My wrist is average size and the watch looks like it was tailor made for me.The band links are held together by screws,so you will need the small eyeglass screwdrivers to adjust the band,but it is real simple to do."
3,Some wonderful singing,"This album, recorded by Don Weiss and the UCLA Madrigal Singers contains some old standards and also some pieces not normally found in Christmas compilations. Technically, this is not a well produced album; often the solos stand too far out in front of the chorus. This is especially noticeable during the flute solos. These singers were hand-picked by Weiss,and have wonderful voices. Many of those you hear on this recording are currently performing at various opera houses around the country and world. I especially enjoy the sprightly pace of Carol of the Bells, the lovely alto on Still, Still, Still, the strong baritone solo on Love Came Down, and the non-traditional Estampie Natalis."
2,Not my type,"Well to tell you the truth I heard great things about this book but I was a bit disapointed.The characters were made well enough, they were there, but, you really did not get to know their inner selves at all. the book had no thoughts, simply actions, whichn rreally left you clueless to exactly what kind of people they were.as for the rest of the book....I couldnt finish it. I got to page 77, and let me say there was a fightscene that had extended almost the entire way there. it was still going when I stopped reading, so I cant tell you exactly how long it was... but wow...it was just to long.I suggest you steer clear of this book, but hey, it might just be your type anyway."
4,The Binding Stone - Excellent Story!,"I just finished The Binding Stone and have to say I really enjoyed this story. Great characters, interesting twists, excellent job on both villains and heroes alike. The novel felt fresh and exciting.All in all, this is one of the best WotC novels I have read in the last few years. I really felt invested in the characters and loved the way the story unfolded - it kept me hooked with suprise and suspense throughout."
3,Used this set as a kid in the Eighties,"I had this set when I was a kid in the 1980s, and in those pre-Internet days, this WAS the world at my fingertips. It's a bit of a relic these days, but it's where I got my start."
4,Grover Goes to School,"I reccomend Dan Elliot's children's book, Grover Goes to School, to kids as well as adults who enjoy a light-hearted story with an Aseop's Fables type of moral interwoven into the plot. This story teaches children the valuable lesson of knowing the fine line between kindess and being taken advantage of. Comical, yet serious, it's an overall excellent book!"
1,Installation problems,"I purchased CS2 several days ago and still have been unable to install it. My hardware (RAM, harddisk space, CPU speed, operating system) all exceed specifications and yet, CS2 won't install past the initial stages. I followed Adobe's troubleshooting guides, including installation from the desktop and Windows Simplified Mode, but absolutely no success. It's unclear where the fault lies (is it Microsoft Windows XP or Adobe CS2?), but I've never had installation problems with software before and it's hard to believe it would occur with such an expensive package from such a major company. Do check the Forums and reviews prior to purchasing this particular package to ensure you're comfortable with the risk. I hope I can get my money back."
1,BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT,"I have spent 9 hours in 2 days on the phone with Dell to try to install this piece of s**t. Version Cue will not install nor will photo shop. No 800 number for support from Adobe. Paid for call and recieved many voice ads for products and was told if I need support call at 'top of the hour'. Dell says the problem is in the installer. Adobe Foroums have pointed to the same but no suggestion has worked. Guess I will work on amazon to try to return it for a full refund, it was shipped defective."
1,its useless for art fine its graphic formula RIDDLE,"dont waste your hard earned money ADOBE IS MOSTLY SOFTWARE FOR LOOSERS burdened to their guillotines OF COMMERCE, ADOBE SOFTWARE is so CONFUSING,non intuitive WORKING WITH IT IS like tearing your teeth out one by one using pliars,"
5,Great Album,This is one of the best jazz albums I've come across by Brubeck. It's mellow without being dull. I keep playing it over and over without being bored.
5,VERY WELL DONE AND ENJOYABLE FOR TRADITIONAL BRUBECK FANS,THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES OF ALL THE BRUBECK CDS I HAVE IN MY COLLECTION IT IS VERY GOOD AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY JAZZ/ BRUBECK AFFICIANADOS TO BUY IT!
5,One of the best Brubeck albums,"While Dave Brubeck's crew are best known for the album ""Time Out,"" this album recieves my nod as the next best album--it beautifully captures the hurried compression of humanity, the New World passion, and the Big Apple spirit the way that few albums have. It's all here, from the downtown bustle of the ""Theme From 'Mr. Broadway'"" to the melancholy stroll through uptown that is ""Sixth Sense,"" to joggers and baby strollers competing for walkways amid a riot of flowers in ""Spring in Central Park."" Dave's piano work is more relaxed and less stiff than usual, allowing Paul's sax to sparkle and the whole album to breathe fully. These are some of the quartet's most mature performances, so don't miss them!"
5,definently a cd worth pickin up,"this is definently the best underground sh*t I've ever heard from Memphis TN. some of my favorite songs from this album are 2 much, bar none, heltah skeltah, who we be... f*ck that I think all the tunes on this album are awsome! go and pick this sh*t up, and believe me u won't be dissapointed... PS I'm 15 not 1 ************* Killa_Kav *************"
4,Lovely,"The color of the ring is not quite what you see in the picture. Instead of being light swiss blue topaz, it is the darker london blue (which I actually prefer). I am very pleased with this ring. It is old fashioned and fancy but can be worn with anything."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,This ring is beautiful but it is NOT STERLING. It has to be silver plated and not very good plating at that. The plating wore off very quickly to reveal the base metal underneath.
4,Highly recommened!,I can't believe this is Nancy Turner's first book. She writes like a veteren. She gave Sarah Prine such a great voice that I really felt I could relate to her. Very enjoyable book!
4,I loved it. 4.5 stars.,"It was heartwarming to read a book about good and decent hard working pioneers and the dangerous conditions and characters they came up against in the Arizona territory in the late 1800s. The girl Sarah tells the story of her life in diary form over 20 years. Very uplifting. It always amazes me to hear how people lived day to day in the early days of our country. I laughed and I cried. It's such a simple beautiful book, full of fascinating characters. It made me appreciate my ""easy"" life, but also long for life in some of the ways it once was."
4,These Is My Words,Very entertaining and a page Turner. Multible stories in one. The main characters interaction with others and inner dialogue is realistic to someone during those naive times and her time of life.
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Through the eyes of the main character, Sarah Prine, the reader ""finds"" her diary and travels with Sarah & her family as they try to find a home in the west. The reader feels like he is a part of the adventure. The family encounters challenges that most of us today would not be able to live through. I did NOT want the book to end; I couldn't say good bye to these folks and luckily, there are two other books that have joined my Kindle collection featuring more of Sarah and her family."
3,"Now, these are MY words","I had wished that the main character in this story had made different choices. It seems at every turn she was making mistakes and driving herself further from happiness! This was a good read for the day at the beach, nothing too hard to understand and no deep thinking."
5,These is my words,Great book - bought the other two in the series after reading this one - had to find out how her life turned out!
3,These Is My Words,"The beginning was remarkably similar to ""Mattie Spenser's Diary"" by Sandra Dallas, and I was disappointed by that. I kept at it though and was pleasantly surprised. It's a lovely book about a girl becoming a woman in the Arizona Territory during the time of Geronimo, and all the trials that came with that time period. It's a fun read."
5,Great historical fiction,"I was so impressed with this book that I ordered about four more of them to give as gifts--then when I ran out of them, I ordered about four or five more! NEXT I ordered the two other Sarah Agnes Prine books, Sarah's Quilt and Star Garden. How nice to be able to continue with Sarah Prine's life for two more books that ended in a third good marriage and lots of trauma in her life leading up to a contented ending.I even wrote to the author in Tucson and she responded very quickly which I truly appreciated."
5,Oh my goodness. What a book!,"I'm still staggering; I've completely lost my equilibrium after finishing this really, really, really wonderful book.I started the book in an afternoon, fully intending to put it down by five to see to some paperwork. By seven I'm weeping through the whole box of tissues, laughing, and generally feeling every human emotions I possibly have. I love this book a lot. In fact, I'm buying the hardcover soon and put it in a special place on my shelf.Sarah Agnes Prine is indeed a true woman of the frontier. Her life is never easy, and her love hurts her as well as it brings her happiness. Oh God, just thinking about the last line of the book sends shivers up my spine.This book is indeed a tribute to the strength of women, and the crosses we have to bear sometimes to survive in this unpredictable world. Thank you Ms Turner, for this book. Thank you."
5,A book you'll always remember,"This is a book that you will always remember. Usually a diary isn't the type of book I like to read, but this book swept me up in the time and Jack and Sarah's love for eachother. This is a must read AND one to read over and over again. There is always something that you may have missed from the first time around."
4,These is my words,"If you love the west, and western stories, you are going to love this book. It was a totally believeable book, and I would have loved to have known Sarah. Would like to see it made into a movie.....it would be an old one, like the old John Wayne stories.....I love those!"
5,An amazing roller coaster ride Jean from Utah,"I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing book. Every now and then there comes along a story that completely draws you in and will not let you go. I found myself being drawn back to its pages at all times of the day or night. The characters became my family. I cried with them , laughed with them, felt their joy and pain and experienced their fear.Thank you Nancy Turner for your magnificent gift. THANK YOU FOR SARAH!"
5,Very entertaining,I really enjoyed reading These is My Words. It kept my attention from beginning to end.
5,These is My Words,I love this book! So much so that it is one of my favorite gifts to give to my friends who love to read. The journal style adds an easy flow to the story and I enjoy reading about the exploration of the west. The individual strength shown by the main character who endures the hardship of exploration demonstrates the importance of the female in the westward expansion.
4,I could not put it down,"I bought this for a camping trip. I completely enjoyed this read, and could not put it down. I liked the journel format used, and was sorry to come to the end. I will be reading the next in the series. It is a light read, easy to pick up for a short spell and come back too- It had some romantic moments, and drama."
5,Sweet story...kept me wanting to continue reading.,Although it was a little slow at the beginning...the book picked up and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend it to all of my friends.
5,These Is My Words,"This book took me to another time period and way of life. I usually do not read historical fiction, but this was recommended to my by some friends. I could not put it down. It was excellent! Truly a classic."
4,I really enjoyed this book.,"I enjoyed this book very much. I have read several books, historical fiction and non-fiction, about the territories in the U.S. during this time period. Although this book doesn't put events into historical context, it doesn't need to in order to be terrific! I looked forward the turn of every page and found many quotes that were noteworthy. Sarah is a character most any woman can relate to and Jack, a man to respect. Lots of food for thought and perspective wrapped in a great story."
5,All time favorite!,"I absolutely loved everything about this book; it's setup as a diary, the characters, the setting, the time period and most of all the accurate history entwined throughout! I had been searching and searching for a book exactly like this and am so happy to have come across it. It is a most amazingly, well written novel with a truly inspiring heroine, a perfect touch of romance, and full of real life hardships and adventure! I highly recommend this book to anyone!"
2,Too tragic a tale to be realistic,"I debated between 2 and 4 stars, but after all is said and done I wouldn't recommend the book to my friends, so it came down to 2. As for reading enjoyment and ability to hold my interest, this book gets a 5. However, the first 30 pages contain enough trauma to send any woman to a pyschiatrist for years! Rape, murder, tragic child deaths, Indian attacks, attempted abduction, etc. It was a bit too much for me to handle.Although the description says ""inspired by the author's grandmother"", very little of the story is based on fact. When I first started reading it I was floored that so much happened to one woman. After some research I found out that it wasn't the case, the tragedies had nothing to do with her grandmother. And while I had read many true life histories and am aware that some pioneer women had very traumatic lives, this one goes a little over the top."
5,These is my Words,"I am Sarah Prine. I so connected with this character that I thought we were two souls tied together. I am also glad to hear that I am not the only ""crazy"" person out there who stayed up until 4am because I could not get enough of her! Please continue with a sequel the strength of Sarah and let me play Juana in the movie!"
3,These is my Words by Nancy Turner,"These is my Words is a good story but it seemed less like a ""diary"" and more like a regular novel written in the first person. Also, it kept reminding me of Gone With the Wind. Then I noticed on the front cover a notation that said Sarah and Jack were ""as delicious a couple as Rhett & Scarlett!"" So it must have reminded other reviewers of Gone With the Wind too in some of the characters and the situations. If you liked Gone With the Wind you will like These is my Words."
3,Okay book,"Got better half way through, but wasn't a fun read. Can't imagine living in those times. Overall, I wouldn't recommend."
4,Realistic and moving,"She could be anyone's great-great grandmother. And her story is as real as the dirt roads, as touching as any mother's love and as painful as any loss. An awesome insight on to the women of the westward movement and their part in the nations founding."
5,fantastic read,"This book is great--I have read many historical fiction works, but this was my first about the settlers of the American southwest. I'm so glad I picked it up!"
5,A treasure,I bought this book for a quarter at the library because I liked the cover!! I got very lucky. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down. I am excited to see the story continues with other Sarah Prine novels....can't wait to go get them!!
5,I absolutely adored this book!,"I read this novel nonstop, at home, on the bus to work, and while I was at working, sneaking off to read it and on the bus again and back home. When I was finished, I started it all over from the beginning. It is simply and beautifully written, and it made me care about every character, especially Sarah. I loved her strength, innocence and sincerity. I would recommend this book to anyone, young and old alike. I absolutely adored it."
4,A Taste of the Old West,"This was an enjoyable read. The story seems contrived and far fetched in places, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment. The author does a good job in bringing to life the hardships faced by the settlers of the American west, particularly the women."
2,Above-average fanfic,"I couldn't help comparing the book unfavorably with Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's ""A Midwife's Tale,"" which juxtaposes the actual journal entries of a late-18th/early-19th-century midwife with the historian's exhaustively researched observations about what these entries tell us about that time and place.""These Is My Words,"" by contrast, is a better-than-average fanfic about Nancy Turner's ancestor. I say better-than-average because Turner did create characters I cared about -- so much so that I dreaded turning the pages for fear of the horrific fate that could befall any one of them at any moment. (The author's habit of relating events chronologically, rather than spilling the bad news right up front as a real diarist would have done, also bugged.) One tragic death, in particular, was set up in such a contrived way that I was rolling my eyes even as tears flowed out of them.On the other hand, everyone else in my book club found it enthralling."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,I love this book soo much..sarah is soo inspiring..I felt like I knew her.. Its a book you can read over and over and love every minute! I want a sequel!!
2,I wanted to like it more.,"And, I actually feel guilty that I don't like it more. It is a Diary of a woman facing hard times. It was just hard to get through as a book, and I actually felt relieved that is was over."
5,Sorry to come to the last page,"I thought this was an excellent book about where I presently live Tucson, Arizona. Sarah's life in the form of a journal kept me turning pages. It was like reading Belva Plain's Evergreen all over again, I wanted to continue on with the characters, to read more, and not come to the last page.I really enjoyed the writer's style using the journal format. It gave me a good perspective of life from Sarah's eyes and the adventures she endured.We do plan to utilize this book for our local book club. There are questions for review at the end of the book. I found that helpful."
3,promising first outing,"an enjoyable medium -light read--pretty fair page-turner and hits the target audience between the eyes. This is not quite literary candy and definitely not quite literary sirloinThe Formula: assemble the cast of somewhat cartoonish characters- The Wonderful Best Friend-The Alpha Male ""Man She Belongs With""- The Lurking Rapist-The Adoring Brothers and then bring on the hardships and tragedies-She is sort of an Ayla of the West-ie. Clan of the Wagon Train Bear-you know- she who shoots straightest and fastest, she who is admired by all and chased by many.How the West was really won by one brave and amazing woman-(just like James Bond made the world safe for democracy and got MEN to read)Why not?!"
3,An okay book,I had to read this book for a highschool English Honors class. I thought it was an okay book. It was very slow at first. It becomes much better towards the end of the book. The first part was awful and through the book the highlights seemed to be Sarah having kids and people that she loved dying. I enjoyed a few parts of the story but the rest just was not to interesting to me.
2,These is my words,I purchase a lot of books from the used books department at Amazon. This book ws the worst quality I have ever purchased.
5,A Wonderful Book!!,"The immediacy of the first person narrative coupled with the author's use of understatement in Sarah Prine's journal thoughts and writings made this one of the best books of the year for this reader. From the first sentence, I was completely immersed in Sarah's world and felt priviledged to meet all the members of her family and to witness her relationship with Capt. Jack Elliot. There are unforgettable men that we as readers all carry in our hearts, and Capt. Jack Elliot certainly deserves to be included among them! These Is My Words is just one of those wonderful, sink-right-in-to-the-book stories...tailor made for a cozy winter weekend reading experience."
5,This was a GREAT book! I loved it,I just loved this book. I looked forward to reading it every day and hated for it to end. Sarah is a wonderful heroine and a wonderful character. Please read this book!
4,Fun Read,"I have to say that I was dubious when this book was first suggested to me, but I quickly fell in love with the protagonist, Sarah! The main character has a believable voice which helped me get into the book. This book is filled with amazing characters who you will find yourself laughing with, rooting for, or against, and definitely crying with. I also appreciated that Nancy E. Turner is true not only to her characters, but also to the times and places her characters are living in. True however does not mean easy to read. Younger readers especially should be aware that some graphic events are described in this book including murder and rape. Don't however let this dissuade you from reading, it is only meant as a caution."
5,this book. was fantastic.,"I love Historical Fiction - it's my favorite genre to read. I bought this book (along with another historical fiction piece, ""The Vanishing Point""... I also reviewed that one) and eagerly dove right into the story after reading so many positive reviews.This novel didn't disappoint. I loved the way the author wrote, the emotions she elicits with the scenery and situations. The protagonist of the novel, Sarah, is immediately likable and ""real"". I found myself reading this book nonstop in between work and life, and finishing it within a few days. I'm looking forward to purchasing and reading her follow-up novel, which continues Sarah's story.Enjoy!"
4,Jazz meets Electronica,"Great album, and tastefull mixture of Jazz and Electronica (House ,Ambient,etc.)Bugge incorporates a traditional Jazz trio (piano,upright bass & drums)with Synths ,Hammond Organ,Samplers & Loops . No mistake about it, this is Nu-Jazz at his best.Jazz chords and beautifull melodies over Danceable Grooves and tasty Synth work. He's one of the premier jazzman from Norway,he's played with Terje Rypdal and Jan Garbarek .If you like Jazz with Grooves and nice Textures, you won't be disapointed .Smooth yet Groovy ! Bugge has a new 2001 release ""Moving"" on Jazzland Records ,check it out, it's also a wonderfull album ."
3,"works great, but too bright!","This works just like I wanted - it is too hard to find a hanging alarm clock and this does that great, with good reception, and nice big buttons. However, it really is just too bright. We put a cloth over it and it still shines though. Conveniently the way it works it goes off at the same time every weekday (which is a smart design). Because now we just have it covered so it doesn't shine blue, but the alarm still works and we can still hit the buttons. Stupid, but functional."
2,Don't waste your money,It looks good in the outlook but the signal reception is so weak.Is so sensible to the static energy produced by other home appliance.The backup battery never work.
4,Was what I expected,"I just wanted a radio for the bathroom that I could hang on the wall. I got what I expected. I guess I'm not really crazy about the way the time is displayed (hour on top, minutes below) but it's not that big of a deal. Also, the light is really bright, so we now have to partially close the door betwen the bathroom and bedroom, but that also is not a big deal. Sound quality is fine for getting ready for work in the morning. All in all, it was a good unit for the price."
1,Does not have a digital tuner,"I must have missed the specs that the clock radio does not have a digital tuner. I can't give it any real ""bad feedback"" because once I opened the box and saw the tuner was analog, I boxed it back up to return it."
3,Good Survey,"Good at identifying launch failure events and summarizing history, but lacks details on the actual failure modes. Tough area to cover since much of the info is classified, proprietary or lost deep in corporate files."
4,so many types of failures,"Harland takes us considerably beyond the simple news reporting of a space system failure. We learn that these have occurred quite frequently in the last 50 years. The book gives an appreciation why. Starting with the fact that the launch rockets are essentially large bombs, that have hopefully controlled explosions. But not always.Then, when the probe or satellite gets into space, much else can go awry. The batteries might fail. The communication chips that talk to ground control might have been misprogrammed. The gyroscope needed to orient the satellite could be defective. And so on. If you are an engineer, the book is a nice education in what has to work in most space systems."
3,No real insight or investigation,"The references at the end of each chapter are mostly from Aviation Week. Basically, it is a collection of the press releases and Aviation Week reporting on the incidents covered in the book. That IS useful, but it could be so much more powerful with the insight that engineers who worked these programs could have brought.All the information is available and some of the conclusions don't stand the test of time. One glaring example, when discussing the Chinese launch of commsats ""18 July 1998 effectively marked the end of Chinese participation in the commercial launcher market."" This has proved laughably untrue as China is one of the dominate players, whereas it is the USA that pushed out of this market."
4,fits great,no more rain down my chimney. Its most important to get the right size. The chimney cover i purchased was only 1/2 inch larger than the chimney and just barely fit. I would get the larger size next time. Bolts on in seconds.
1,I Feel Swindled,I purchased this gas can November 2008. I am very sorry I bought it. Besides leaking at the nozzle when I pour gas from it the bottom of the gas can has rounded out just sitting on my garage floor. It has rounded so bad that I have to lean it against the garage wall for it stand up otherwise it would fall over. I keep it full at all times. I am not sure why this happened but I am disappointed in Briggs and Stratton. I expected better quality from such a company. I would not recommend this gas can. Don't make the same mistake I did.
3,Gas can failures,"It is unfortunate that everything has to be made from plastic because it doesn't last long for one thing. I haven't figured out how this thing is supposed to work until today. I asked my neighbor (male) if he could look at it After checking it out he too could not figure it out. Low and behold my other neighbor (female) asked what we were doing and guess what? She removed the cap that is attached to the inside of the nozzle. Talk about dumber then dumb. Pray tell why anyone (mfg) would put the cap on the inside of the nozzle is beyond me. Maybe they do things different in China. Maybe we should just stick with made in America.So, seeing that we (three of us) have mastered the possiblity of a gas flow it might actually work pretty good. I will further comment after I actually put it to use."
2,Not durable enough.,"We bought two of these cans to use with the premium gas used in our scooters. Even when completely full they are still light enough to handle easily, they don't spill a drop and the gas comes out just slow enough that I don't overfill the tanks. The spout has a hook on it that goes on the lip of the vehicles gas tank. You click on a plastic ring on the cap to allow the spout to be depressed and the gas is dispensed. Release the downward pressure and it shuts off without spilling a drop. They also are just transparent enough that I can see how full they are. Unfortunately the plastic dispensing mechanism isn't very durable and they broke within a year or two."
5,Burdon proves why he is one of British Invasion Greats!,"This album is Burdon at his most heartfelt best. The material is strong, and his voice is even stronger. ""Wicked Man"" is a collection of mostly the other ""Comeback"" cuts. So, if you like the ""Comeback"" movie or soundtrack, you'll love this. Very bluesy, guitary, and moving."
2,Pre-School Card Game,"I wanted several easy-to-travel card games for my 4-year-old granddaughter. I had seen her enjoy these games at a pre-school class and thought they would be fun to own. Unfortunately the over sized cards were too large for her to hold in her hands. Normal, playing-card, sized cards would have been MUCH better. Also the large size required more room than is usually available in an automobile. It was a good idea, but did not work well in the execution."
5,Old fashioned fun for children,My grandson's had lots of fun playing the games with Grandma and Grandpa. Would recommend this game pack for anyone with small children.
3,Does not quite fit my MotoQ9c,"This cover does not quite fit my MotoQ9c. I had to cut it away to reveal the bottom row of keys. I had to enlarge the hole for the mike because it wasn't quite in the right spot. I had to trim around the wheel button on the side to be able to use it reliably. The top doesn't fit well so it sticks out rather than lying against the phone. I still use it because it will cushion the phone if I drop it, but it is mildly annoying that it doesn't fit better. It might work better on a different model of MotoQ."
1,BEWARE - TROJAN HORSE!!!,Hi!Do not download the manual submitted. It contains a Trojan!!How do I report this to Amazon? Write to flavio.silva@pobox.com
1,Totally non-evidenced based,"I am a physician, recently diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia myself. I read this book at the local bookstore, hoping to find a good book on hypoglycemia. Although the book starts off well, it then leads to non-evidenced based recommendations that go as far as recommending to eliminate dairy products from your diet altogether, and recommending mega doses of many vitamins and supplements. I am a big fan of integrative medicine, but please, as with any medical advice, there needs to be more evidence to back up these claims that can lead to potential health problems (especially with the mega doses of vitamins). I do not recommend this book, and in fact find it irresponsible to title it ""The Classic Healthcare Handbook, "" when there is little or no evidence behind many of the ""healthcare"" recommendations they make."
4,Trying to Understand and Planning Accordingly!,"I bought this book in hopes of being able to read it through with the teenage boy (14) that had recently been diagnosed with Hypoglycemia. The sheer panic that set in when he went into a seizure initially from this disease scared all of us. I wanted to be able to sit down with Albert and have this be a book that would both answer some questions and additionally invoke questions to be answered.I initially had Albert read this on his own...he was completely lost, as I would have been at 14 years of age. This was something that I should have and would suggest to parents/friends in the future, to make sure they do...read it first.Initially it seemed that there was alot of life changing activites that evolved surrounding this event. Gradually, however, it turned into something that was workable and livable with an extremly active 14 year old.I would recommend this book to those who wish to get a quick education on hypoglycemia."
4,Great book... Just have an adult blackout/whiteout some parts.,"I'm 13 yrs., old almost 14, and my parents bought me this book because I'm a teenager and it was recommended by JFPO( Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership). Just the same, I wish they had read it first. There were some references to adult topics that I did not want to see and that I wish my parents had removed first.I also don't like rock music. Those, however are my ONLY complaints withs this book. It's fast-paced, exciting, thrilling... in a nutshell, GREAT! It is an excellent example of what those New World Order freaks want to do to us. No meat, no guns, no opinions (except those that are approved, of course), everybody tracked, drugged, and the list goes on and on. However, I think that an adult should read this first and blackout/ whiteout some parts, those parts being the only thing that kept this from getting a 5 star rating."
5,NECESSARY FOR ITALIAN SCORE LOVERS...WHAT IF?,"Great choice for people who love Italian scores, because Grandpa Morricone has played a great part in it. These discs included almost every masterpiece he composed and surely became one of the most important GREATEST HITS CDs ever released.I've got digital files of this edition and enjoyed it very much, but still couldn't make up my mind to buy it - what if grandpa went on to make more masterpieces enough to release VOLUME 3? Then I'm gonna buy SUPER GOLD EDITION - VOLUME 1-3. That will be awesome with his later works from CINEMA PARADISO to MALENA."
3,Not enough Julie K Smith,"Not the worst way to spend 90-ish minutes. Lots of very nice girls take their clothes off with a plot a see through as your Grandma's pants.The highlight of the film (for me) was Julie K Smith. She does about three sets, which is about a billion too few. With short blonde hair and full breasts, the girl just steals the show.Would I buy it? I already have.If you want acting and story like The Shawshank Redemption, you'll be dissapointed. If you want gorgeous women with very few clothes on, you should buy this."
3,Songs are great but the sound quality is not.,Pick up this cd over the holiday weekend because it has quite a few Riot tunes (circa early 90's)I didn't have. My tastes lie more with the classic Fire Down Under/Born in America albums. Anyway the songs are great and are quite representattive of the band's career(witness the inclusion of Rock City and Narita).Unfortunately though the mix and overall sound is not much greater than a bootleg. Songs like Killer and Runaway sound muffled at times and the first song does not start until about 2 minutes into the cd (it begins with a muffled entrance/interview with the band before taking the stage).My advice is to pick up Shine On which has an excellent mix and perhaps the Guy Speranza/pre-Fire Down Under live release (I don't have this one)instead.
2,Pretty bad overall,"I remember buying ""Fire Down Under"" on cassette back in like 1981 or so. Had 2 friends who we all loved Sabbath, Rush, Deep Purple, Zeppelin, etc. Then I introduced my pals to Riot! Woah, they were hooked totally!!! ANYWAY, later on I bought Restless Breed and Made in America. But this one sucked. The songs were ok, but the recording was horrible. Guitar work was lacking. Could have been great, but I wasted my money on this one."
5,Helpful!,Have difficulty dealing with situations where you want to be nice but need a new tact in order to be effective? This book helps.
4,Common Sense and great pointers,"In my book, this book is common sense that many just need to see on paper. It is much book to make a few points. It is narrowed down to being honest with yourself and saying what is right for you. Interesting read to have."
1,boring book,"I read a lot of materials about nice guy syndrome so I bought this book with oher books on the issue. I can say the book is very boring,there are no anectodes or interesting examples only some advices about doing this or that. Also most of the examples in the book is about the authors difficulties with doctors. I dont understand why he gives so much example about the doctors."
5,Possibly the most helpful book I've ever read,"Maybe it's just that I needed this book. But several others to whom I've given or suggested copies have reacted as I have. The book mercilessly and accurately analyzes self-defeating habits, so there's no running away. And specific, easy suggestions for change are provided. ""Easy"" doesn't mean emotionally easy. One really has to want to change. ""Easy"" means it's no problem understanding what one must do to change. I've made so many changes already. And my life is so much better for it. One person thought the book was about co-dependence. I think the book is far wider ranging than that. I don't yet know exactly how to characterize this book, but if you want to change your behavior in some profound way and are really serious about it, this book may be exactly what you need."
5,"A good, in-depth book. Recommended",Although this book's title suggest something very light it goes in depth to cover every (9 in total) of self-sabotaging mistakes. Although I also bought 'The Assertiveness workbook' and thought that I will just quick-read 'Too nice for your own good..' and then focus my full intention on first title it is just the opposite.You should really use amazon's feature to 'look inside' the book and see if it suits you. I can tell you that the book is interesting in the beginnign as it is in the end. A very good self help book.
5,Life changing and revelatory,"I've read a lot of self-help books and most of them offer the same information, albeit in different words. This book has truly different and unique information. Don't give advice? Is this guy crazy? I live to give advice, whether it's asked for or not; and since I know everything I am uniquely qualified to give advice to others. So my advice wasn't always well received, so what. This is the first time I understand why giving advice isn't helpful, and how to offer information instead. It's mind boggling that I never understood this before. I thought I was being nice.To stop giving advice is just one of the 9 behaviors ""nice"" people have to change. The title doesn't do this gem justice, it is packed with wonderful information about how to live more honestly and authentically. I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks they may be too nice for their own good; you'll find out your niceness isn't serving you or anyone else well. Definitely life changing."
3,At most an average computer book,"The directory structure described in 1st chapter doesn't fit Tomcat's directory structure. The text description is correct, but the screen shot is wrong. Also in 1st chapter, the JAR files that should be included in PATH variable also have the wrong name. This is very low-level mistakes.The 2nd chapter reviews HTML. Well, it is rather confusing than helpful. Then in Chapter 4 the author talks about database and tries to explain Normalization. I'd rather the author skips on this topic because he/she seems just lack of ability to explain things in the clear way.I bought this book to learn JSP, not to compose an errata for the author. I believe most readers don't like to do that either. If you would like avoid unnecessary headache, look else where."
1,CRAP,"I did not read this book through because not even the 1st sample code works (due to configuration). Sent questions to two of the aythors the email addresses given in the book are not even valid !!! I went to sun website and the anwser was straight forward. If a book for novice can not explain better than Sun's official documents, why bother write the book?Waste of time and Money! Keep away from these authors who failed to display professionalism!"
4,It was a hit,"My niece is thrilled, she loves this book. She is 8yrs old and this is the perfect age level for her!!"
4,Rosa Parks: My Story,"the rosa parks: my story book is about a real story. rosa Parks is a wonderful preson that changes people how they are with black peolpe.The front book is not hard hard cover; it has pictures of her and on the bus, and another one with Martin Luther King. The story Rosa Parks is black and white and by the front it title is Rosa Parks: My Story.One day it was December 1, 1955 Rosa Parks just came out of work tires and weary from a long day, she got on a bus and saw a white 40 year old man saw Rosa Parks. Then Rosa Parks just sat and did not refuse to not give her seat for him......Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama."
5,One great book,"Rosa was an ordinary little girl accept for her skin color. When she was little Rosa's dad left her family and they never saw him agin. Growing up Rosa lived with her mom, brother, and her grandparents on her mother's side. Growing up Rosa always was sick. She mostly got tonsilitis. Because she was always sick Rosa was small for her age. Her brother who was two years younger than her almot weighed as much as her. Rosa married Raymond parks. When Rosa did not give up her seat to a white man on the bus she was arrested for sitting in the colored section of the bus."
4,Conversational History,"I am not even remotely a history buff, but I started trying to learn more about African American history after seeing it being ignored in high school and my first college. Books like these make it far more interesting for me to want to learn more about our legendary American icons. Most people know the basics of Rosa Parks, but this book clears up some issues that photo captions or books written by others may not (ex. the real reason and day that Rosa Parks took the fingerprinting picture, her mood about taking photos on the bus after the boycott was over, how she feels about her health being documented, a prisoner she helped after the woman threatened her husband, how Mrs. Parks feels about nonviolence and Malcolm X). I can read any dry history book to find out an overview of Mrs. Parks, but this book felt like I was sitting cross-legged in front of her, and she was conversing about her life. I enjoyed it."
5,My Sergio Mendez phase,"Sergio Mendez has been with me since the mid 60's, when he started adding that Samba beat to regular 60's tunes-The Look of Love, Fool on the Hill, and i believe his own, Mas Que Nada. But i never knew that he had a purely instrumental album out there, and with Antonia Carlos Jobim to boot. This was part of the Exotic culture that your grandparents were into in the early 60's. My favorite track has to be the Girl From Impanema, practically a standard in the early to mid 60's. This is nice as background music for a quiet dinner party, or if you're just sitting back and reading from your Kindle that you got from Amazon. The liner notes indicate that there was more material that came from this meeting, but was unfortunately destroyed in a NJ warehouse fire in '78, where Atlantic had all their demos and sessions work stored. Pity, because a deluxe version of this would be fantastic!"
5,Insinkerator Instahot filter,"This filter is easy to change, and you don't have to turn off the water. I like having my hot water filtered. All around positive for me."
4,perfect,the website took me strait to the part i needed and gave me many choices and options i am very .....
5,Insinkerator replacement filter,Recommended replacement part works great! Water flow increased dramatically. Will replace every year to keep instant hot working properly. Loved getting 2 in package.
4,Better than at a store,Product works great. I was not expecting to get two for the price of one. grat deal considering that they are more expensive at the store and you only get one.
5,insta hot replacement filter,"The product is excellent. Very easy to install. Comes with stick on labels to write date when installed or when to replace. I like the fact that they come in a two pack. One for now and an extra to change when due, it gives me time to reorder."
1,Flooded Kitchen!!! BEWARE,I was upstairs when I heard water running and no one else was home. I went to the kitchen to see water pouring out of the cabinet. I quickly figured out what it was and turned the water off but by that time half the kitchen was flooded. The filter was cracked on the bottom like others have said. I'm just glad I was home and had the water off within 30 seconds. Do NOT buy these filters. I will inform my insurance company so if they have paid out claims because of these they can go after In Sink Erator with a pattern of failure in a poorly made product.
2,Two cracked filters,"We've had the in sink erator hot and cold water dispenser for 6 years. I use it mostly to make coffee in the morning and have not had any problems, until the last time I bought replacement filters, which come two to a package. Both filters had small cracks in the bottom, which were not visible when I took them out of the package. The result was that water leaked all over the kitchen floor. Very disappointing."
5,Perfect Replacement,"On-line, In Stock, and cheaper than anywhere else. What's not to like? Try locating this elsewhere....not at this price."
5,Great value and readily available,"I chased these all around town in the big box stores, no one had them in stock. And the funny part, they all told me it would take up to 2 weeks or more to special order them, not to mention a price approx 20% higher. I liked the online price, and service was top notch, receive them in the mail two days later. Will definitely order from them online again."
5,Still like it after several years.,"We've had one of these in our house for a few years and I liked it so much I installed on at my mom's house. It was easy to install and easy to change the filter on. One is on an Insinkerator hot water system, the other on a Waste King."
4,"Works great, and at half of the store price","Filters are not exciting to me. However, I am happy about paying half of what I would of paid, had I ordered it through a shop."
1,Cracked F201R filter floods kitchen and basement,"InSinkErator F-201R Filtration Replacement Cartridges, 2-PackWe woke up this morning to discover that our kitchen was flooded with water from a crack in a F201R filter. The water seeped through the floor and rained into our basement, covering a wide area. We had to call in professional contractors who removed the almost-new flooring from our kitchen and drilled holes around the bottom of each cabinet to allow tubes to be inserted from multiple industrial strength dehumidifying units. It's a real mess, and it will be several weeks until the kitchen is fully restored. Fortunately it is covered by USAA insurance. The contractor who built our kitchen never told us that we needed to replace the filter, in fact I didn't know that it was there until today. Instant hot water is a nice feature, but we have made little use of it. Now I am wary about using it at all."
1,Every 3 months???????,"The price on this item is way too high to change every 3 months. I didn't realize you had to change it every 3 months and came home from vacation with a flooded kitchen because the filter had cracked! VERY expensive oversight having to re-tile entire kitchen, so don't let it go over year. Same thing happened to a friend."
2,I must have gotten a lemon,"The tv has a great picture, for the 21 days it worked. The bottom portion, completely went out. It kind of shows fuzzy color on occasion. Thank god it was before the 30days was up. I just returned it. The tv also showed burn in, and considering it only had about 12 hours of watching on it... Thats just sad."
5,Simply Mad about Harry,"The first time I saw or heard Harry was on a television special. I was so taken by his velvet voice and bigband style that I fell instantly in love. I was in highschool, and I suppose I was just like those teenage girls who swooned over Frank Sinatra way back when. I bought the album, after quite a bit of searching, and was blown away. ""We are in Love"" was my first taste of big band jazz music, and my first taste of Harry. He showed me a new genre of music that I've come to love. Thankyou Harry, when it comes to you.. I AM in love."
5,This guy knows what he is doing,I rate this CD with at least 10 stars> I love it and so will you. It is funny and romantic. Perfect for February 14th and all year long
3,3.5 STARS,"This album is pretty good, but not as good as Mystikal's other albums. My favourite track is definitely ""Tarantula"" Featuring Butch Cassidy. Most of the other tracks aren't anything special though. If you're a big Mystikal fan it's probably worth getting, but don't expect it to be as good as his other albums."
5,SUPER !!!,I would give it ten stars if i could. Simply one of the best pieces i own. You will not waste your money and your time!
5,Big Truck!,"Excellent combination of spare beats, New Orleans horns, thrombus bass and the wild man Mystikal laying freak styles all over. Incorporates many different moods from cool to sexy to house. Lots of fun for your party, south-style."
2,Go back to No Limit,This album pretty much stunk to me the only song that was good was bonucin back. He needs to go back to No Limit and use his high energy rap lyrics again
3,What's going on?,"What happened to the Mystikal I used to like? I was very disappointed with this album. Mystikal's first album was really good, as were his follow up albums on No Limit. Even his last album was pretty good, but this album is not up to par with those albums. The production is great with the help of KLC and The Medicine Men. Maybe it's because he doesn't have many tracks with other guests, enlisting Juvenile, Butch Cassidy, Method Man and Redman, that we get kind of tired of listening to him scream. I mean, every Mystikal album has him sharing the mic with other rappers and when we here him by himself, we get turned off. I dont know what it is, but I dont think he is as good as he used to be. This album is a so-so. Go back to your roots, Mystikal."
1,its not as good as his first,"i agree with the reviewer who said he feels sorry for the artists who get caught in a image that they created.and gets critisized by their fans for changing it.i do too but why change a formula thats been working sense unpredictable? more people bought lets get ready because it wasn't real hardcore or rugged and raw.plus it was more club oriented.yes i liked lets get ready,but knot as much as i did the first 3 cds.he tries to recreate what he did on lets get ready but fails HORRIBLY.he should have dumped the tracks and replaced them with the songs that was intended for the ORIGINAL lets get ready cd.wich was originaly gonna be called lets get ready to rumble.or atleast kept them for lets get ready and put the lets get ready traxs on tarantula instead."
2,dissapointing just like the last,i agree with a previous poster.he needs to go back to nolimit.if you hate no-limit well then thats your problem.but he needs to go back.this album totaly feels so so.hopefully rap ingeneral will come back to there senses.
2,what the uck??,okay if your lookin for a fast paced in your face rapper dont buy this cd if your lookin for a wanna be sisqo rapper this one is for you even though some of the beats are tight(thats why i gave it two) thats all your gonna get mystikal has turned from one of the most respected to one of the most dissapointing rappers out there!!
1,If there was really a God...,"then mystical would be waitin tables at the ""Burger Barn"" instead of rappin...1 star 4 this s**t, and that's only cuz they make u give everything atleast 1 to save the artist from total humiliation..."
2,its IIIIGHT,"This album is probably Mystikal's second or third best album, but sad to say...its wack. Yes Mystikal rips the mic on almost all of his guest appearances...but on his albums he lacks the beats to match his voice an flow. ""Bouncin Back"" is a good song but after that the cd runs outa fuel rather quickly. Even Juvenile showin up and providin a beat on this album cant save it. The beats by the Neptunes & Medicine Men fall short as well. Which is why this album is below average. If Mystikal could ever find the ""RIGHT"" production then he would be cool. But it dont look like that will happen anytime soon."
3,not too good,"wasnt what i was expectingg,i would rather give it 2 and a half,but i cant,so just think of this rating as 2 1/2"
3,Just has to grow on you,"O.k. Mystikal's latest cd is not as good as his others to me but its not that bad. His first three cd's were all tight but this one (along with Lets Get Ready)is missing his unique gansta type flow, which most rappers couldn't compare to. When i bought this album i was hoping he went back to his thugin style of rap that put him up in the industry but instead he has strayed even more to pop music and leaving the smooth gansta beats a thing in the past. overall the cd is iight and it is growing on me. If u are a big fan of club party songs then u should buy this album. But if u are a fan of fast lyrics over tight gansta beats maby u should keep this one out of your mystikal collection and get a old one u might not have yet like, Mind of Mystikal or Unpredictable now those are some tight cd's."
2,This time VERY bad!!!,"I ordered these fruit roll's like I have before from this company with no problem...BUT this timeThey ALL were SO bad, it crumbled all over the place when opening, and were stale!!I ended up throwing them away!I wish the company would see this & send me a FREE order that actually does not fall apart,and are not stale!!"
1,Stale as can be. Rock hard and crumbly,"I have ordered these before and they have been great. Usually soft and chewy the way they should be, NOT THIS TIME. These are stale and hard they do not even unroll as they crumble into pieces if you try to unroll them (they are so hard)."
4,Rap fan from the V-town 707,"this is a pretty good soundtrack, even though the movie itself is weak(i'm sorry but the drf can't act). This cd has rappers from all over the bay and the valley. If your a fan of bay area rap I recommend this cd. The best rappers on this are mac mall, woodie and lowdown."
4,TEXAS KILLING FIELDS,"The movie was good. I had the priviledge to meet Brian Goetschius, one of the Texas City investigators at my brothers' house. He is their neighbor. Very nice man and very intelligent. Michael Land, another Texas City investigator, said Brian was a ""guardian angel"" and prayed over the dead bodies."
2,Confusing - Poorly Edited,This movie was confusing - not sure if it was the writing or the editing. There was a hole side plot about a prostitute that went no where.
1,Slow slow slow,Hard to follow because I kept falling asleep. Boring storing. I loved the report on tv so I I wanted to see the movie. I was wrong the report was so interesting the movie---we'll not so---found it confusing and left you kinda wondering why I wasted my time
2,Poorly Constructed Script,"Not sure if it's the script or the editing but this movie is a jumbled mess. It's so disjointed I wasn't sure what time period we were in; what time periods and homicides were suppose to be a part of the factual basis to the movie; not sure of the outcomes for all the bad people and good people. Most of the characters seemed like black and white (only bad/only good) cutouts. Boring stereotype of prostitute life, johns and dumb cops. Usually when a movie is based on some factual event there is note in the credits to that effect with actual outcomes yet the lack of such information makes this movie a very dubious rendition. Since this was a so-made-up plot I would have scripted Chlo Moretz into an even more pivotal role."
1,Mis-leading,"I thought the whole premise of this movie to be mis-leading. As a cop movie, it was OK. As a more factual movie, (based on fact) I thought it was bad. I live about 2 miles from the ""killing fields"" and know a bit about the history of these crimes. The movie was far from being factual."
1,Bad movie,"Amazon delivered this DVD quickly and efficiently, but the movie is terrible. The actors are grade C and the movie is very misleading. It was NOT about all the young ladies who were murdered or went missing in that area."
2,Bad Quality Video for BD !!!,Texas Killing Fields is not a bad film. I rent it in Blu-ray yesterday here in Brasil and I want to ask WHAT is the industry doing with this tecnology? This movie has a BAD quality video. It looks like a DVD and far from the good ones DVDs!!! The dark scenes are terrible !!! I use an Infocus 1080p and have watched excellent BD with great quality video.Texas K F is a shame to the BD tecnology !!!
2,Boring,"Drawn out and sometimes hard to follow. I was expecting a lot more, especially from watching the trailer! Not worth the $4!"
4,Good Suspense,Everything in the movie was well done and the story flowed nicely. My only beef is if Sam Worthington's character is supposed to be the Texas local why he had no Texas accent like every other 'Texan' portrayed in the film? Due this flaw it was difficult to discern which of the detectives transfered from New York. Other than that is a superior suspense based on true events (not sure how loosely though).
2,What a mess!,"I wonder if ami mann was drunk during the meetings in the editing room , it starts out promising for the first 25 minutes then just serves up a series of vignettes , yes there is always a central theme around trying to catch a serial killer but the film cuts don't gel it just seems to jump from scene to scene leaving u dumbfounded , it does recreate certain atmosphere if u like dark police procedurals , possibly a rental , but forgettable and doesn't even compare to some of the best in the genre"
2,What a waist of time,This story deserved much better play writing! The film was hard to follow and didn't do justice to the reality of what happened.
3,Definitely a rental,"This movie suffers from poor editing and a soundtrack that is too loud for the (mostly mumbled)conversations going on. This is basically a good story and the actors are very good. The cinematography is excellent. However, anyone not knowing what the story is all about will be lost. Try this as a rental first."
3,Pretty Good Game,"This was the first game i bought for my PSP, and it is pretty good. The graphics are very good, but then again most PSP games are good graphics becasue of the PSP.The sound pretty much stinks and the narration is horribal. All the narrator says is who has the ball, nothing else. It is pretty easy to bascily play the whole game and win 90% of the time once you know the controls.The controls are very basic and there isn't a control for a lot of the things. Which measn it does it when you don't want it to, or it doesen't do it when you want it to.The golie in the game is pretty werd. Durring a free kick he can't move, and you can't really control where he is.Overall this game is pretty good but i would recomend that you also try FIFA."
4,Car mount,"Bought this to mount a 17"" LCD in my van. While it is multi directional i'm going to have to create a spacer so that i can mount it and have teh LCD flip up with the screen pointed towards the roof (prevent accidental damage)."
1,something wrong of the price??,"World Encyclopedia of Champagne and Sparkling Wine, Revised and Updated Edition (Hardcover),$495 US Dollars, is it something wrong??"
1,Not recomended,The book was teared up and so dirty. I did not touched the book since then since the time I got it 1 month ago!!
4,Not Quite 5 Stars,"Yey more proof that some of the the most interesting developments in jazz are happening in Scandanavia right now. Whilst not quite a 5 star affair, this is very interesting non the less. Check out Nils Petter Molvaer's Khmer as well."
3,"Good, but missed some important areas.","I thought this book was good, but sometimes tip-toed around subjects that could have been very useful to know. I had to use Visual Basic On-Line help more than expected due to this problem."
1,it's definately not a coffee table book,"i know how to program in a couple languages, and i yet have to learn how to program in visual basic with this book....this book doesn't teach programming. unfortunately, like many visual basic books, the authors tend to concentrate on the interface and forget all that hard-core programming skill that a beginer needs to know...which who this book is supose to be aimed at?"
1,The most unstructured book I have ever seen!!!,"What was most annoying about this book was that the author does not teach programming to the beginner. He teaches how to do little tricks with Visual Basic without really explaining how it works. I also hated that the author kept saying ""Don't worry about this code right now, I will explain this later"" and explained it either 100 pages later or did not explain it at all. If you want to buy a book worth its money, buy ""Visual Basic 5 Superbible Set"". ""Beginning Visual Basic 5"" is at most a guide on how to use Microsoft Visual Basic 5 Learning Edition, but it definitely does not teach you programming."
3,Adequate info but too simple for experienced programmers.,"I expected more when i bought this book. there are not enough information regarding image and picture and more complex controls coding. generally however, it is a good and fun book to have for non-experienced programmer in whatsoever languages (i.e. a true beginner in programming)."
5,Excellant VB Guide,"Whenever I see a block of code in any language, my first instinct is to freak out. It's just a natural reaction.However, Peter Wright's smooth intro to VB let me adjust to it before he threw any code at me.Basically what I'm saying is: If you want to learn VB, BUY IT!!!! I came into it with previous programming experience which probably did help, but he makes VB seem so unfairly easy that I wanted to learn it all on the first day.He goes through it step-by-step, and covers one topic at a time. Then, he uses what you've learned in previous chapters to make really cool programs.One thing to keep in mind is that the book isn't so helpful if you aren't at your computer often, or you don't have VB software (the Control Creation edition is worthless, even though he says you can use it). Other than that, it's a real winner."
5,"Great Intro, slide right into VB.","It's scary just how easily this book presents topic after topic. From the first lesson to the last, you'll never feel as though you're doing anything difficult. By the end of the book (with a little playing and practice), you'll be able to create *useful* VB apps.The only thing missing, which IMO should have been at least introduced, is the new ""implements"" keyword, which provides (admittedly sparse) inheritence capability.Also recommend: Beginning Visual C++ (Wrox), Hardcore VB (MS press)"
3,A good supplement to other begginers books,"No doubt this book has some good stuff in it, but I didn't use it for my core VB learning. I didn't like the flow of the material, and found that I was left stumped at several points. I also found the book not very usefull as a reference if you are trying to find something or refresh your memory. I also found Peter's writing style an inhibitor to my learning experience. It just left me confused sometimes.I did find some good code examples and used some of the class examples in a project that I was working on. A companion CD is a must for this kind of book, but is not provided.Overall, this is a good book to have in your VB library, but don't rely on this one alone to learn VB."
1,Book could be a lot better,"I'm in a class which uses this book as it's primary text. We have problems in some of the code exercises. Some of the code in the book just doesn't work and it gets really aggrivating dealing with it. Additionally, features and functions are incorporated without first explaining them to the reader. Overall this is not a very good book to learn from. I personally had to purchase additional materials to better learn the material."
4,Good down and dirty intro to basic VB structure/features,"This book does a great job at presenting the VB basics to someone that doesn't need someone to show them programming logic. Many programmers aren't artistic enough to come up with programming logic of their own... this book is not for you. This is an intro to VB features and structure only. No insight into logic or creativity. That's up to you. If you already program in another language and want just the facts. This is a good start. Doesn't get much into OOP, API, DLL etc. If you have never programmed before this book will get you started but don't expect it to teach you programming logic. There are other books that WROX offers to follow this one.Two suggestions for Mr. Write: Have someone else correct your poor English and you may not want to put your picture on the cover. I don't think it is going help sales much."
2,Skip this one,I got this book largely because of the good reviews I found here. I found that it is poorly organized and topics are not well explained. Peter makes the mistake of introducing concepts not yet covered and using complex examples. Get Michael Halverson's Step by Step instead.
2,"Good primer, but exercises unhelpful","Peter Wright's book does a better than decent job of instructing the reader in VB programming. However, the beginning reader will be infuriated to discover that successful completion of the end-of-chapter exercises is often impossible without going on a wild goose chase though online help. Depending as they do on concepts not covered in the chapter from which they supposedly follow, the majority of the exercises do not help the reader feel as if he or she is progressing in the language. In this respect, Peter Wright's book is best used alongside a print copy of the programmer's reference.It will be greatly beneficial to newbies when a book is published that truly does instruct the reader in all aspects of the language. As it stands now, one has to purchase two or more books in order to feel somewhat competent at VB programming."
2,Bad end-of-chapter exercises,"This is a good book to learn VB from, until you get to the Chapter 7 end-of-chapter exercises. They make up a project that the reader is not at all equipped to produce. Wrox should come up with a different set of end-of-chapter exercises and make them downloadable."
3,Uneven,"While there are many good explanations of programming concepts in this book and many hands on exercises, I found the coverage to be uneven. 1) The author never explicitly tells you about 'comments. 2)The author says that he hates printing, and - guess what? - there is not much information about printing. 3)Author tells you to have a play with VisData but never tells you how to enter data. 4) Author skims over explanations of example programs. This is especially evident in the knowledge base program in Ch 18. 5) Treatment of graphics (especially animation) is paltry. 6) Multimedia application is overly complicated for a ""beginning"" book. 7) The exercises at the end of the chapters were written by someone else and many of them require knowledge that was not presented in the chapter. I firmly believe in the old saying, ""life by the yard is hard, life by the inch is a cinch."" There are too many yards in this book."
4,"Entertaining, but examples not alway clear, need CD.","Peter has a great writing style and uses numerous examples, but needs to be more specific in his examples, really detailed for beginners. A CD would be really helpful for interactivity and demonstration. I found while doing the exercises at the back of the book that there were concepts needed that were not previously introduced not good for a new programmer."
5,Listened to the taped version-GREAT!,"I don't have time to read just now, so I listened as I drove to & from work this week. I feel very motivated by the ideas Julia shares. Her experiences have made me realize that I can be in charge-and only I can do something about my weight. I need lots of motivation now and hearing the emotion and feelings in her words made the 'book' more honest. I have a long way to go and I will listen to the tape many more times, just to keep reminding myself that it can be done. I want to use her ideas for staying motivated ex;posters and goal pages. I think its great because I can tell that she is a REAL person just like me. I don't need the glitz & glamour, just down to earth honesty. Thanks for sharing so I can get started. This is the most insiteful story I've heard."
2,Where were the editors on this?,"This ""book"" is inspiring somewhat but not the motivational masterpiece it purports to be. She tells her life story and tries to insert some help for readers along the way but please, where were the editors for this project? There were so many spelling and grammatical errors it was a total distracton. They could not be chalked up to ""typos"" in this magnitude. A sixth grader could do better. (Unless the sixth grader attended the same schools)"
5,It inspired me.,"I think Julia has the right idea. She makes the rights things to do easy to achieve. I was over 200 lbs and was at a point in my life that I did not want to carry all these extra pounds. So, I checked out Julia's books, the ""Easiest diet I never went on."" And ""Awakening the diet within"". The things she shared inspired me to lose over 20lbs in about 5 weeks. Now I'm feeling better with a little weightloss, but have a ways to go. Following Julia's book ideas and implementing them into my life I know I will reach my goal and be much happier and healthier. THANK YOU JULIA!!!!!"
1,A waste of $,"i bought this book hoping to be inspired by it. i read the first 1/4 of the book and then started skimming to 'get to the good part'. Unfortunatly i didn't find one. The author just goes on and on about her life story, which if that was all it took to write a book i think that my life story might be better and i don't find mine to be that spectacular, but it would be more interesting than hers. The only thing that i found somewhat inspirational was that i realized that i had better things in my life to do that read this book."
1,"Nothing new, irritating to read.","I bought this book based on the many favorable reviews I read. As for the comments on spelling and editing, I figured, ""how bad can it be""? Pretty awful as it turns out.The crux of the book is: 1) Drink lots of water (she recommends up to a gallon a day); 2) Base your diet on ""Julia's pyramid"", with water at the base, followed by fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and starches; and 3) Exercise. Her personal story may help motivate you IF you can follow the meandering narrative. There is nothing new here, just the typical ""eat less, move more"" advice...."
1,Where's a proofreader when you need one?,"I'm not sure if this book contained any valuable information. I had too much trouble skipping over all the errors in grammar and spelling to actually read it all. Like a previous reviewer, I am wondering how this got past an editor! I ordered this from another source, and returned it within 2 or 3 days."
4,A true Cinderella Story....,"I really enjoyed this book very much. It's the true story of a person perhaps like yourself with 100+ pounds to lose and a dead end life. Julia goes into great detail about the circumstances of her life while she was overweight, and gives all the ""insider tips"" on how she achieved this amazing weight loss. I agree with the previous reviewers that the lack of editing at times makes for tough reading but it's refreshing to see this book published without all the ""Suzanne Sommers"" type slickness and empty message. Julia DOES have a great message and story, and it does come across. This book is for all the ""real people"" out there who want to know how to transform their lives."
4,An outstanding collection of Terry Richardson,Terry Richardson really makes me believe he is enjoying his life. This is a wonderful collection of some of his photography. This oversized magazine really shows off a lot of his love of trash culture. My only complaint is that I would have loved to see it in a less disposable medium.
4,Concise and yet complete,"This book is an excellent tool for intermediate learners. It covers both European and Brazilian Portuguese. But there are two drawbacks: 1) The book should have listed the alphabets and their pronunciations (e.g. how to pronounce the foreign-borrowed letter 'k' in Portuguese.) 2) Chapter seven: 'verbs': this chapter should be the core of this book. The authors, however, do not give the English meanings of the irregular verbs they list in this chapter. They provide the English tranlations of everything but the irregular verbs presented in chapter seven. This is weird. Overall, this book is highly recommended for intermediate learners to review and grasp a solid understanding to the verbs and grammars of the language."
4,Quite good but...,"This grammar book is better than most. I like the well organised way materials are presented, systematically numbered, so you can find the item you want. The index is helpful too.The book is well balanced with a fair amount of detail on everything except perhaps verbs. There could have been more detail there. For detail on verbs you have better buy another book, and Portuguese Verbs Explained by Manuela Cook is the one I have bought and am quite pleased with.More detail could have been given to grammar points in this grammar if space had been used more appropriately. There is a whole section on historical and cultural notes including literature, music, cinema, etc. As interesting as all this may be, it has nothing to do with grammar. If I wanted a book on music or cinema, I had bought one. In a grammar what I expect is grammar!"
2,Incomplete Kindle,"I have only purchased a free sample of this book for my Kindle, but it is already enough to tell me that I cannot buy the full book. There appear to be vital charts that I simply cannot read. If there are key elements to pronunciation that are inaccessible to me, I am missing out on the major point of the book."
3,Very useful grammar book in English & Portuguese,"Portuguese: An Essential Grammar is a very helpful review of the correct grammar for learning Brazilian or European Portuguese. It is easily & simply formatted for fast reference and extremely helpful. I suggest using it in conjunction with this handy little Brazilian grammar bookPortugus Descomplicado. And you can also combine Portuguese: An Essential Grammar with a Portuguese-Only textbook, such asFalar Ler Escrever Portugues Text (Falar...Ler...Escrever...Portugues Portuguese Edition).IMPORTANT UPDATE: This book has NOT been revised for the Novo Acordo Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa (2008). I don't recommend this book because you will learn the old spellings for Portuguese. Wait until they release a new edition. If you use this book, you'll be learning obsolete spellings that are no longer correct."
1,A poor effort,"This grammar describes Lisbon variety of Continental Portuguese and misses to explain other usages, especially Brazilian Portuguese ones, which limits its range of functionality. The grammar is not particularly friendly of colloquialisms and it is more appropriate for those interested in old literature. Using the language explained here will certainly cause strange looks, not only in Brazil, but in some parts of Portugal as well. This is such a poor effort, it almost hurts to have to write this review."
5,A valuable record,"I've had this record for over a year and have grown to like it a great deal. Aside from including all her works for violin and piano, it also has most of the chamber works that Tailleferre produced in 1973, all of them enchanting, but it is a pity that they couldn't have squeezed the Forlane for flute in as well (it would have just fitted). The selection of solo piano works is bewitching. This disc is well filled and delightful, and because there is no competition it is valuable. I would urge everyone to explore Tailleferre's work. She has absorbed the virtues and lessons of Satie and Debussy and Ravel completely into her own unique sound, which is just as original and valuable as those great composers."
5,Excellent and easy way to make learning Spanish FUN!,"This is a fantastic way to learn Spanish. The book is very user-friendly and self-explanatory. Its use of activities, play-on-words and humor help the lessons become easier to commit to memory than the ""high school classroom"" method. Arlene has a talent for making languages fun and easy to learn. This book is a great tool for beginners, intermediates or those who want a refresher course in the language."
4,FUN & EASY,"There's nothing ""easy"" about learning a new language but Quick-Start Spanish immediately took the intimidation element out of beginning the process for me. I especially like the ""whole-brain"" approach. I seem to be retaining so much more than I imagined I would. It's fun, easy to use, and some of the exercises (in English) are an incredible help in understanding the workings and differences in the language. This book kick-started a 2 and 1/2 year learning adventure for me, and I'm still going. I recommend this book for beginners and reviewers as well."
4,easily understood,"Although the books does not clover everything and lacks a several important entries in the investment field, but it is really very easy to understand."
4,Succinct - compared to the source material,This is a synopsis of a large body of work (1000s of pages). It is a Tibetan study so it's focus has more ceremony than Theravedan practice.
3,Lengthy competence,"Laurent Garnier falls somewhere into the category of semi-intelligent electronic dance music-makers between people like Vibert and Schnauss. Framing often (but thankfully not always) around House beats and simplified melodies, many of these tracks do tend to overstay their welcome but the few that feel configured properly contribute to an overall successful effort."
3,Good Concept Album Best Suited as Movie Soundtrack Music,"This album does a great job of creating the moods at which is attempts to produce: those of unreasonable behavior. This might be driving dangerously or perhaps being overly greedy. You can even get lost in the adventures of the album. It's hard for me to find a place for this album. I can't imagine playing it at a party or hearing it at a club. I think it's better suited as background instrumentals for scenes in movies or something. This album is not for a mainstream audience, but more for someone who enjoys concept music as an artform. I'd only rate it as 3 stars, but others may mind it more redeeming."
2,Unreasonable production,"Perhaps being a little jaded by other compilation albums that actually have scope, I popped this sucker into the cd player. Well. Alright, there are some stellar tracks that manage to combine interesting rhythms with squelchy synthetic basslines, taken as a singular track. Actually, theres 3 of those that succeed, and then there's 1 buildup track that worked rather well for me, and 2 straight house tracks. The rest of the tracks don't really work as songs in themselves (too little change) and most of them wouldn't really work as dancefloor material, with about 3 exceptions. And the impression of dementia is really only skin deep. Perhaps attempting to create a sense of continuity, Garnier threw a bunch of well produced, yet similar effects into most of the songs, which unfortunately lead to a continuous listen that reveals less and less as the cd goes on. Tasty outside, creamy filling inside. Do you like Twinkies? I don't."
1,188.00,why would anybody pay 188.00 for a notebook. that last year i bought for 8.00 do you have the wrong price for this
1,Junipero Serra and The California Missons,I enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to read and understand. It is a great resource to use in the classroom. The book contains a lot of information regarding Father Serra. It is written in a form that provides just enough information for the average fourth or fifth grade student.

3,Return of Marvel's Western Heroes?,"For anyone thinking they will see the old Marvel Western heroes of yesteryear, think again. These ""new"" versions of the old standbys are quite different from the originals of the 50',60's and 70's. Kid Colt (my old favorite)has an anger management problem and shoots defenseless enemies.The other characters also have different slants. They are basically new characters with old names. Once you get past that, Ostrander's story can be viewed in a different light. This story is a recycled Magnificent 7 at best. The art on the other hand is outstanding.If only someone would bring back the old characters with a fresher more original story."
2,Look at the Review Below,"For any true punk fans: please read the review directly below mine. I mean no disrespect to the people who enjoy pop, but Blink 182 should not be pop; they are a punk band. The review below just proves who their current fans are. They have sunk to a new low in my mind. At first Enema didn't seem so bad, but the more of it I hear and the more I see the videos, the more I find myself angry. Blink 182 has lost its edge and gone trendy. To me, they are dead. R.I.P."
3,I HATE ALL THE SMALL THINGS,"just like one of the other reviews, what happend to Blink-182 i still like them but i mean,all the small things SUCKS!, i would only buy it for M&M's I love the old Punk Rock Blink-182 not the new mtv pop version:("
1,Does Deserve the One Star,"I don't own this, but I have Enema of the State. All the Small Things is really Blink-182's descent into pop, not What's My Age Again. This is not an original song by all means, and I'm sorry I'm saying the same thing for the video. I'm a huge Blink-182 fan, but this is unacceptable. I do like Tom's singing on this one, though. It's sad I've seen kids moshing to this song, when it's got possibly the worst guitar lie and chorus of any song by them, so I wouldn't buy this if it was on the cheap rack for less than a dollar."
1,Have you earned enough money to play punk rock again?,"What happened to you guys? I remember listening to cashire cat and feeling a little sorry for you guys because you seemed to have problems playing the guitar properly. And now I have to see you on MTV being compared to bands like 'Take That' and some 12 year old girls screeming 'Blink, ohh, you guys are so sweet, I love you'. What the heck happened? Where is the old punk rock, are you ever going to play good music for me again, instead of earning more and more money?"
5,This is the best song ever!,"Blink 182 is a great band, and their best song ever is definitely without a doubt All the Small Things! On the most popular radio station around here they have a top 10 most requested songs thing at 10 o clock and All the Small Things has been on it for soooooooooooooooo long. So I'd just like to say to those peeps who gave it 1 star, you have absolutely no taste in music and well, GO LISTEN TO YOUR NSYNC AND BRITNEY SPEARS THEN!"
4,Pretty Good!,"I don't see why everyone's always saying ""i liked blink when they were punk, but now they're on mtv, so they suck!"" They've changed they're music style, so what? they've matured (well... sort of...) M&M's and All The Small things are both great songs and both represent how blink can play more than one type of music! I've liked blink since before they were on mtv and the radio, and i still like them just as much as i used to, a good band is a good band, whether they are on mtv or not"
4,well....,Alright blink 182 is a great band and I'd like to say All the small things is a great song but not at all their best. All the old albums are much better than enema. The song is cool. The big plus side of this cd is that it has M+M's on it from the old album cheshire cat.
3,So So,"Has a lot of cleaning tools in this kit but with little to no instructions on what's what. All I wanted was a cleaning kit for my handgun and this would do the trick. But if you've never cleaned a gun before, it doesn't give any help on what to use. That's where Youtube comes in handy... The case is kind of poorly constructed (feels cheap) and the tools don't stay very well in their slots. I don't know if I'd purchase again."
5,Mangia,"Great book and in very fine condition. The author was born in the same year as my mother, who is also Italian. I bought one for each of us."
2,A Porn Movie turned book with no real story line,"If you are looking for a book with no pictures and you don't want to pop in a video to get you off and the perverse is what gets you off than this book is for you. Otherwise, if you are looking for a novel glorifying ethhic sexual gratification and a great mystery novel then you will be greatly disappointed. The language of the author is ingenuine of American rappers, the story line is completely assinine (the detectice has less than 24 hours to recover an item and he spends most of the day just having sex, and out of like 232 pages 220 is just sex scenes. This novel is a complete failure if the attempt was to write a serious novel on ethnic men and their sexuality."
2,Too Big,The watch on it's own is good looking. But even for a large man the watch face is too big and heavy.
1,Needs service - kiss it good by,Second hand fell off - suppose to be under warranty - after you pay Invicta to accept it then another charge to repair. This was some two months ago and I have not seen the watch sense..Cheap watch - no service company.
4,classic good looking watch,"This is a great looking watch. An expensive look with an affordable price. And the watch seems of good quality (cannot say the same for the band). Yes the watch head is large but that seems to be the style of watches and jewelry these days so its not that big of a deal. Its got a stop watch but this isn't the watch I would get dirty running a 10K. The only reason I am giving this a 4/5 is the band. The band must have some kind of color stain on it that gave me a rash not unlike poison ivy! Be mindful if you have had allergy problems with wrist watches as you will probably have an allergic reaction to this band. Luckily you can find hypoallergenic bands that look just like this one for relatively cheap. All that being said, I still think this is a great watch!"
4,"What, can't YOU afford a BIG watch...?","I got this watch from Amazon, and I like it a lot. But I already have some big watches. You sort of have to try one to see if you like watches over 40mm; and you WILL get comments. I am right handed, but I wear the watch on my right wrist anyway for fun. The movement seems to be a chronograph turned upside down, with the stopwatch start button on the bottom; which I believe is unususal. The white hands on the buff dial are a bit hard to read quickly, but the dial detail is fascinating and pretty. This is a beautiful watch for anything under $700. You ought to get you one!"
4,Great Watch,"A casual yet elegant watch, cream color dial makes arabic numerals easily readable and the wide case diameter gives you a clear visual of every movement of this time piece..."
2,Pretty design --Poor Quality,"This delicate charm is dainty with small diamonds. However, within 2 weeks the last diamond on the row at the base of the crown fell out leaving a gaping hole. Then yesterday the charm ""snapped""off its hinge making it unusable."
2,skaters rejoice,"I don't like this music all too much at all but maybe a little well not really. I can't skate to this music, oh wait I can't skate anyways, even if I did the music wouldn't be any better."
4,Classic!,"This is one of those hidden punkclassics of the 80s, wich there are kind of many of. If you're looking for a good punkalbum from that decade, just look for the ""Dischord""-moniker, and you're most probably in for a treat. Gray Matter is a hardcore punk band, but at the same time they're more than just your average punkband. They're in fact a voice of youth - their lyrics are easy to relate to, you don't need any higher education-degree in literature or being good at analyzing poems, they're easy to understand, and, especially if you're between 17 og 25, you may find your own thoughts and meanings made into songs on this one. Further, the music on this on are very popish to be a 80s hardcorepunkband - they're not what people who don't like punk would call ""too noicy"", it's in fact nice melodies. And they've got a singer who actually can sing.Highly recomended!"
2,"Sophomoric, God forgive me.","One can only be filled with awe at Hellen Keller's life, and gratitude for those who helped her achieve the full life she lived. But this autobiography could have been shortened by half. Letter after letter contain almost an identical description of her relations with the numerous benefactors, so that one can easily skips four or five pages at a time and not miss anything. The value in the book is gaining a clear impression of Helen's perceptions of all surrounding her, and an appreciation of how far a searching mind can glean even from languages. But the repetitiousness of the prose, becomes cloying. Good as a background research text."
5,A Real Inspiration!,"I love this book, and look forward to reading it when I have a few minutes between appointments. A real inspiration!"
1,Very disappointed,"The cover of the book was the only part that was attractive. The print is a reprint, photocopy, or something. Perhaps this is how the item was described...but...it was hard on the eyes to look at the pages."
5,AWESOME!,"Say goodbye to the sucky experience of loading your magazines at the range!I have a Hi Point C9 9mm and this loader makes my range experience so much better. No more fumbling around putting rounds in a mag, no more sore fingers, no more struggling to get the last couple rounds in.I love this thing and can't say enough good about it. It is tough and made of quality materials. The magazine fits perfectly inside it. I am 100% pleased with this product.If you are on the fence about buying one, I can tell you that you won't regret your purchase."
3,Not as Adjustable as Expected,"This loader is incompatible with a Walther PPS. The HKS didn't work because the PPS magazine has a flange on the outside that makes it too wide AND the ""pinky finger"" section of the grip that's attached to the base of the magazine prevented the magazine from being pushed far enough up into the loader.To generalize the problem, the only ""adjustable"" part of this loader is whether you're using a 9mm or a .380 magazine (i.e. the front-to-back depth of the magazine). If your magazine is too wide or too short there is no way to adjust this loader to work.To be fair, the description did not specifically say that it would work for the PPS, but it did claim to be ""adjustable"" and said that it fit ""others"" in addition to those specifically mentioned. I'm sure it will work just fine for those magazines specifically mentioned, but to say that it is ""adjustable"" and fits ""others"" is not entirely accurate."
1,Wasted Money,Does NOT fit Taurus 9mm single stack or any 9mm Luger single stack magazines.Does NOT work with any 1911 9mm magazines.
1,Useless Loader,"I just purchased this magazine loader for my Beretta 92FS (9mm) and my Smith & Wesson (9mm) and the loader does not fit. My magazine does not fit into the loader, the magazine is too wide on the top to fit into the loader. I can't use it. The loader entry is too thin for the magazine to fit. Now, I also tried to use it to load a .22 Ruger magazine and yes it fits but it doesn't load it correctly. It does not push down the bullet (that's already loaded) completely, therefore you still have to use your finger. I do not recommend this product because it is misleading. In the description it says that it fits Beretta and 9mm guns and it doesn't. Save your time and money."
2,Not good for all S&W or Hi-Point 9mm,"The magazines for my S&W M&P Shield and my Hi-Point C9 (10 round) do not fit in this loader. The Smith's don't fit through the hole where the mag slides in and the Hi-Point's is too long. I have an UpLula that works great for both, even though I've read that it shouldn't be used for the Smith. I have to disagree with whoever said that. If you have either of these pistols, don't waste your time with this loader. The UpLula works great."
4,"Good product, if only...","I found this product just the needed tool to reload my .380 mags. when you shoot a lot, and find yourself doing a series of reloads, your thumbs will begin to tell on you; and this gadget saves that wear & tear.My only complaint is perhaps a broad one, and not particular to this Manufacturer or their particular product: This thing should be made of a good aluminum alloy rather than plastic! Sorry, but there's no way anyone is going to convince me it can't be done, or that plastic will hold up just as well. Other than that, the product does the job; it's just a question ""For how long?""4-stars."
2,It's OK but there are better ones just not cheaper!,The HKS works on my .45 1911 magazines but you have to push the rounds back with your thumb and the loader is plastic construction so it flexes especially at the thumb lever. This is not the best loader I've used (UPLULA is best) but it is the cheapest at about half the price of the UpLULA. If you want something cheap get the HKS but if you want something that works best spend the extra bucks and get the UpLULA by Butler Creek.
5,Very efficient,"I have about 350 DVDs and not much room to store them. I have bought a few DVD racks in the past and they weren't very useful. The ones I have bought were not made well, plus everytime I would bump into the DVD rack, most of my DVDs would fall out. It was quite a hassle and they always took up room.This DVD tower was terrific. Not only does it hold many DVDs, it also saves space. I bought the oak and black DVD tower and it looks very nice against my oak floor. The tower also swivels around and is very sturdy. The swivel is a great feature. I don't have to worry about all my DVDs falling out everytime I move the rack. Very well made and I am pleased with it. The best DVD tower I have bought."
1,Want mine?,My Prepac revolving DVD stand did not fit together when received - early in 2009. Since then Prepac has stalled and done nothing to fix the problem.In over thirty years I have purchased dozens of Ikea kits and had excellent experience with every one of them. On the other hand Prepac is a disaster. I have had to go to BBB and still Prepac refuses to provide either a fix or a refund.I will never ever buy another Prepac product.
5,"""Slogans that used to be scrawled on the wall...","...are written in The Heart"". Possibly the most overlooked piece of brilliance in the Oils discography. This is without a doubt my ultimate Oils album. It's passionate, angry, honest, blunt, raw, deliberate... all those things. Every song on the album gels, individually the songs are good, but taken collectively in one listen this is one awesome album. I especially love the pointed musical trilogy of Quinella Holiday, Loves On Sale and If Ned Kelly Was King, just fantastic. The slow thumping bass riffs of Burnie are haunting, Written In The Heart explodes with the Oils jagged edge of Moginie/Rotsey, Armistice Day & Lucky Country dispell myths with that powerful anthemic spell, and Don't Wanna Be The One just rocks. I could go on and on. I dug this album in 81, and I still do now in 99 - it's the Oils white-hot with passion."
3,Good but not their best,"Before i got this album i was expecting something like 10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1. but i was disapointed.The album is good but it displays little of what the oils are capable of, they dont really experiment with their music in this but i have to say Brave Faces,Burnie,Basement flat are all decent songs well worth listening to"
3,"Decent album, but not essential","This album sounds about what you'd expect the band to sound like between the albums Head Injuries and 10-9-8-7. There are some good songs, notably Brave Faces, Burnie, Quinella Holiday, and Loves For Sale.The main problem with this album is the production. This is probably the worse MO album from a production and mixing perspective. Even the preceding album, Head Injuries, sounds a lot better (more crystal clear), and also has better songs. If this album was remixed/remastered, it would be much more liked. Still, a stereo with an equalizer can make this album sound fairly good.Although not an essential album for casual MO fans, this still belongs in all MO fanatic collections."
2,Inspirational but not much useful information,"First I have been practicing Spring Forest Qi Gong.for over 2 years and it is a great, easy to implement program. However, this DVD is not Qi Gong instruction.There is actually very little real information in the DVD. You will find a short Mantra and a some Qi Gong examples, but nothing I would deem as useful.This is simply an Infomercial that you pay for! It is a seminar that was video taped and then testimonials from that seminar. Being that it is only an hour long, you get more testimonial and very little seminar.I will say that it is well edited and motivated me to continue my Qi Gong practice more regularly.If you have any interest in Qi Gong or Healing others don't waste your money on this DVD, instead purchase the course it is trying to get you to buy instead, the Spring Forest Qi Gong course."
1,Did not like,"I was not a fan of this book. I'm sure on some levels it is very important and has some greatness to it, but I never found it. I found the book to be boring and not once did it hold my attention. While it may be a classic, I placed my copy on the bottom shelf."
5,Great read,"This book is a great read. Though it is only 52 pages, it is straight to the point and a easy read. I enjoyed it very much"
3,the art of war,the book is only a short version of the hardcover version and if I would have been informedporper of that this version is only a sample writting with a handful pages; I would have order theHardcover bookAS
3,thin,"this book is very thin, more of a list... ( 1) statement, ( 2) statement, ( 3) statement... type of book"
4,The Art of War,Very interesting and impressive reading. The tactics written in this book I have witness as a U.S. Serviceman. SUCH TEACHING AND KNOWLEDGE IN THESE WRITING CAN BE USED IN TODAYS BUSINESS WORLD OR EVERYDAY LIFE.
5,Mm,"My sampling of the text influenced my thoughtPrinciples interest me highly yet I find the subject difficult to approachThis was a highly literary text, which I found reassuring; samples were given if I remember on formative pronunciation of chineseA few quotations are fascinating, I relate with them indirectly via the work of other methodistsThere is a trinity I imagine amongst Lao Tsu, Sun Tzu, and Kasporov relating to Time, Elements, and the Sun"
1,Disapointed,This book is over 300 pages and most of the book written by the translator not by Sun Tzu. The Art of War is only about 70 pages long the rest is about history. Its not an easy read and would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Classics,"This is by far the best book on strategy of warfare throughout the history. There were other sound books as well, but actually most of them are based on essential information that is provided here.Having in mind, that current business field is as harsh as any other war, this is an essential read to anyone who does not want to be crushed in the first battle.And one last tip - do not read any ""Art of war for managers"" and etc., only rely on the original. If you are smart enough you'll make your own ideas and outcomes without any outside explanation. And you must be, if you are reading this."
3,Too much background,"I'm not sure if every version of this book is like this, but the introduction is half the book. The author goes through and explains EVERY detail. I, having never read the book, got extremely confused as to what was going on. After skipping halfway through the book I discovered the ACTUAL book. it was hidden deep inside. For a non-seasoned reader who just wanted some strategic reading this was rather annoying. For anyone who wants a background on the book this is a great selection. I have yet to finish it but it would appear the actual translation is in the book."
2,not it,"the book I got was text only; no preface, no introduction, no appendices. BUT Amazon refunded full price and let me keep the book"
3,Who remembers this stuff?,"So the historical section was so long and then theres an introduction on top of that. Somewhere around page 46 I quit and realized that I was not going to remember any of this stuff about Chinese history and this dynasty or that dynasty. Personally, I am more interested in how I can use this knowledge to make critical decisions in the future. I am not a historian and knowing Chinese history extensively will not help me now. I picked back up at the actual translation of Sun Tzu and really enjoyed it. I don't see the point in adding hundreds of pages in Chinese history. I don't think I needed that information to understand Sun Tzu any more than I did. I may try another translation later with less pages."
5,Art of War,"Great book, it came 100% new. No markings or dog-eared pages. I was a little worried about buying a book for only $0.01 ($3.99 S&H;), but I was willing to spend $4.00.Con: It did take a few days to ship but well worth the wait."
4,Ancient style wok,"This wok reminded my wife, who is Chinese, of her childhood. It's cast iron and once seasoned turns out authentic tasting feasts of Chinese food. Just beware it is not flat bottomed!!!"
4,Mighty Machines 2 pack - a hit,"I bought this DVD for my two grandsons (ages 3 and 4) and they love it. They are into trucks, diggers, etc and this definitely keeps their attention."
4,Great Bargin,"These videos have a lot of repetition between the two but my three year old son loves them! They each have 3 main videos and 4 shorter bonus clips. The machines talk about what they do and explain everything that is going on at the construction site, garbage dump, fire house, demolition site, etc.. Perfect for preschool age kids that like trucks."
3,Two for one!,"I do wonder if one day, I will forget the annoying theme song. Not likely in the future, since it is my son's favorite part of the video. In fact, he doesn't go too far beyond the theme song.I do like these. I could do without the mindless banter and silly conversations between the machines. But these aren't for me.My son, who just turned 3, picks these out every so often to watch. He very much enjoys the fire engine one. It does quite a bit of the behind the scenes, which includes things he doesn't get to see normally.All in all, these are ok."
2,Wish they were more engaging...,"I'd love to say these were fantastic since my sons are completely enthralled with trucks and tractors... unfortunately these are old footage, grainy and slow. It keeps their attention for a few minutes but just ends up running in the background. The voice over is dull and for some reason doesn't engage them. Really wanted cool truck footage but this is clearly old reel footage repackaged and just doesn't do it. One clip has been a hit... where they blow up an old mill. We just jump to that a lot. They're cheap for a reason."
2,Slow paced,Our two year old granddaughter was fascinated with the real thing when we saw some workmen putting in pipeline on one of our city's streets. I used to have video with heavy equipment machines at work. We had hoped these DVDs would be like our old video. Our granddaughter loses interest with these. Perhaps later she will have the patience to watch more. They could have used tighter editing or something.
5,Highly recommend!,"This entire series is wonderful! My son requests these DVDs more than any others we own. They are about 90 minutes long, and explore the jobs of the machines- the trucks themselves do the explaining. They are perfect for children 2-5, and provide hours of entertainment (and allow adults to get some things done in the process)!"
2,ehhh??,"My son got this from his grandmother for his 4th birthday. He loves dvds and has a good attention span for his age, but these DVDs don't quite capture it. Honestly, I don't blame him...it's boring! Maybe for a younger age..."
2,Annoying Voices,My 16 month old loves trucks so I was hopeful this would be a good dvd for him. He was mildly interested at first but it didn't last. There's not enough concentrated truck action or music but the trucks talk in the first person and have these really annoying character voices. I thought if I liked this one I might order more in the series but now I'm sorry I ordered this with the lights and ladders dvd. I rented a construction dvd that was shot in the 80s and is super dated but we both like that one better than this.

2,An exact clone of Ape Escape for the PS2.,"I grabbed this when I bought my son's PSP, based on how much we enjoyed Ape Escape and Ape Escape 2 - but despite the different name, this game has the exact same levels as AE2, which was very disappointing. Throw in awkward controls and long load times, and it's not the best gaming experience."
1,"Good Game, Crappy Port","This game was a good game for the Playstation and the controls relied on using two analog sticks. The PSP has only one analog stick. The makers of this game just slapped together a port and half-assed the controls. So it's really difficult to play the game and catch monkeys. Don't buy this game for the PSP, look for it for Playstation."
1,Poorly designed and very slow to load,"My 5yr. old son and I gave this game a try and quickly lost interest as the game repeatedly went to a ""Loading..."" screen with waits of more than 15 seconds. It was ridiculous how frequently we had to wait for a level or even just a menu. They actually show an ape sleeping while you wait for screens to load! So, that's what we did - put the game to bed.Additionally, while moving the character around a level with the analog controller, it's impossible to change the line of sight with the arrows at the same time. You're forced to stop and look araund before proceeding to the next objective. Not sure if we're just not used to the controls, but it just added to the frustration."
4,Underrated,"There's a lot of harsh reviews for this game. Now the game has it's flaws, the vast majority of games do. Even the best ones.The flaws are that the loading times are often and fairly long for today's standards. The controls are a bit tough to get used to. This game would have benefited from an lock-on feature. That way you could better follow the Ape you're chasing.The story is meh, but then again you don't buy a game called Ape Escape: On the Loose for the story. It's tolerable. The voice acting was surprisingly good and frequent. The game is fun and the fun factor makes up for the problems the game has. At least for me it does. At $10 it's a great deal to at least try this game which is, in my opinion, an underrated PSP game."
5,Gualala,"Tom Christensen is one of the most talented musicians to play at Birdland. I wish I could meet him someday. Anyway, buy this CD! It rocks!"
3,Bought for class..,i had to buy this book after i realized that my txt book did not include the cases... was mad... can't really give an accurate review for the item since i didn't willingly buy it...
3,Dove Fresh Radiance Anti-Aging Night Cream,"Not a totally bad product but I will not buy again. I will stick to the Pr Age line. This must be some discontinued Dove item. I ordered even though I had not seen it before...not giving me enough moisture, my face is dry."
3,Martial Arts Mayhem!,"This is a good martial arts movie. You get good fight scenes, but not too many fight scenes, lot of talking! Old school feel!"
3,This one made me a Ennio Moriconne fan,Ennio Morricone has put out some great soundtracks and this one was the first that got me buying his CDs.The music is little outdated for the present but brings out the Charles Bronson tough guy role to a large extent.
5,Keeper,"Working on my PhD in higher education, I have had the pleasure of reading many textbooks. This text is a keeper for my professional library!"
3,Jury is still out,"I have had no problems with this appliance. It arrived quickly once ordered, and it was installed by our plumber without incident. However the plumber noticed that the device is very light, and commented that it seemed ""cheap"". Once installed, his concerns were re-enforced when the motor sound (speed) varied drastically with load (slowing down and then speeding up). Certainly this new device does not make the powerful grunt of our old waste disposal. All that being said, we don't use a waste disposal much (we compost most kitchen waste), so I am sure this is going to be perfectly adequate for us. Despite the un-reassuing audio output (which is not loud), the device does seem to be working fine (whatever small vegetable waste that has gone down has been dispatched without incident).As the unit is working fine we will continue to use it. At this point I do not regret buying it, but we will see how it lasts."
5,Very helpful and readable book on school discipline,"I heard the author on the radio and he made sense, so I bought the book. I am really impressed with it. It takes about 60 different problems that all teachers face and offers many different approaches to dealing with them. The variety of approaches is important because everyone has their own preferences and style, and there are many good solutions to try. The layout makes the book very easy to use (the discipline problems are listed in an A to Z format), issues are explained in clear English, and the suggestions seem quite practical. A very useful book for teachers and others dealing with children."
4,Tax Cut Works Well,I have been using Tax Cut for five years. It is quite easy to use and generally well documented. I would like to see a better ability to select individual forms for printing.
1,beware .........,"We were big fans of TaxCut, especially after Turbo added spyware ..... THIS YEAR'S TAX CUT has irreguarities that are costing ($$) me ......... for example, you file your college student's return and check the box that she/he will be an exemption on the head-of-household return & then comes the surprise, head-of-household can't file their return with that college student as an exemption, despite checking the proper boxes! ....... for example, it can't caluculate railroad retirement benefits ..... for example, it tells you that your return is a-okay, you pay $15, then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another $15 to refile! ........ good-bye Tax Cut!"
4,Worked as advertised,"I have used Tax Cut over the past few years, for my federal returns. Tax Cut does the job, and was relatively easy to use. I do not use the state programs as I can file on-line for my state, which is simpler and faster than using the option provided by Tax Cut. I think the high on-line filing fee ($15) is a bit much, since the process probably costs about 2 cents to execute, and a stamp and envelope is not much more costly. That said, filing method is a personal preference. Having to download a state return is pain in the rump for someone without a high speed internet connection, though it probably makes business sense for H&R to structure the process this way."
5,This saved me time and money,"This is my 3rd year using TaxCut and I trust and love it. It is easy to use and walks you step by step making doing your tax simple.Have H&R; Block backing me up, I feel like I have the experts on my side.I highly recommed!"
4,Handy pocket guide,"I agree with the reviewer from Dec.2003 - the pocket survival guides are not intended to be an authoritative reference on anything, especially not the science of surgery. But in its mission to provide house officers with a useful and quick reference on basic surgical issues, this book succeeds. Very compact & useful to have in your lab coat pocket while on call.- Surgical Resident"
4,Great But Outdated,"Great Book! Unfortunately Outdated. If a new updated version comes out, I would recommend it in a heartbeat however."
3,"It's okay, useful at times.","If you are not going into surgery, or you are just starting out, this might be a useful resource especially for the format of notes and other tidbits."
2,You get what you pay for,This book is very sparse and spends little time on anything besides what is common. May be a good addition if you already have access to a decent textbook.
5,Different & Beautiful,"This is one the best albums I've heard in a long time!I feel ashamed I am just now discovering it - I was in a bookstore awhile back and they were playing some soundtrack with ""Lie in the Sound"" being the final song. I was walking through and almost started to cry while listening to it.The lead singer's voice is simply amazing - the music is sweeping and grand, lush and subtle all at the same time.Stand out tracks for me are: Lie in the Sound, Different Stars, Alone, Vapor Trail, & In a Song"
5,Good stuff,"This is definite mood music, but if you're in the right mood there's no beating this album. It's desolate, melancholy, flowing, and soft. The music is beautiful and the lyrics are heartfelt. You can download a couple full songs and clips from their homepage, and if you like that you'll like this. I recommend it to you if you ever get inconsolably sad and lonely and want music that won't take you out of the mood."
4,Ghostly.,"Trespassers William launches a richly melodic and somber journey through the halls of soulful music! With its beautifully comforting vocals and meditative cords, the listener can't help but be swept away into a state of deep thought and reflection. A truly peaceful listening experience!"
3,Sturdy and Compact,This product arrived on time per PRIME delivery. This is currently being used in a Toyota 4Runner. It organizes a bunch of small items and seems quite sturdy. It doesn't bounce around the trunk which is perfect for our needs. It was smaller than I thought it would be. Make sure to read your dimmensions/sizes. I think I didn't pay close enough attention to this. It is of good quality - just not that big.
5,GREAT FIT,It is rare to find a shoe thats fits like this one. They have just enough stretch to be comfortable all day. I highly recomend this shoe to anyone that needs the wide width. I plan on buying them in all colors Life Stride offers them in.
5,I love this song!,"I'd really like to commend Jonny on this song, Brekin' Me, it's full of passion and great lyrics and I really love it."
4,Great while it lasted,"Anyone who questions the value of Starrett products should purchase one before making a decision. This was my first Starrett, and was so much better than any other combination square I had used before that I won't ever think they cost too much.Unfortunately, this square met an early demise due to carelessness on my part (fortunately, I wasn't injured). I immediately replaced it with a new Starrett that had the satin chrome finish. It cost a little more, but it's a lot easier to read (that's why I'm giving this four stars instead of five)."
5,perfect,"really great quality square, love the 6 inch size for all applications. I've always trusted starrett, would buy again! a"
4,great compilation of a leading edge band,"Poco was an outstanding extension of the country rock sound. I enjoyed them immensely. This compilation stands out as a wonderful mix of live material and album cuts. Quality is excellent. Great material, amazing music."
1,burnt,i got this in the mail and it was a burnt cd. poor quality sound. the price was according but i wouldn't have bought it if i had known it would sound like it was downloaded from napster 10 years ago.
1,No Source Code -> major Let Down,"After Receiving Mr.'s Cantu's ""Mastering Delphi 4"" I am very Disappointed to find that NO CD-ROM is included - despite Advertisement to the contrary. A very brief review of the book itself demonstrates the standard is up to Mr.'s Cantu's usual high quality, but without the source code (only sinpets are in the text) the examples fail to demonstrate their functions. SYBEX apparently chose to place the code on their web-site instead of supplying the advertised CD, but the code isn't on their web page as of yet!(9/26/98). I would have passed on this book had I known that."
1,This is the best book,I think that this is the best book. There are many things you need to learn. I prefere to buy everyone.That's all
3,Another book that is too complicated,"I'm seriously considering writing my own book on programming, since there is a huge hole to be filled. From what I've seen the majority of books cater to advanced programmers, which is unfair and unfortunate. You can't start in the deep end. It's also like that in other fields as well. If you are new to Delphi don't buy this book, you won't derive much from it. The topics covered obviously deal with more advanced issues. Sharp looking cover though."
3,Good but Patchy,"A useful compilation especially of tips and tricks, but arguably not comprehensive enough in either scope or depth. Don't think that buying this book will let you off reading the Delphi help files, or looking elsewhere for basic reference material."
4,"If you only buy one Delphi 4 book, this is the one!",This is the most comprehensive and useful book on Delphi 4 programming that I have come across (and I've browsed ALL the books on D4 that Amazon list).The only reason I do not rate it at 5 stars is the fact that the code in the book is not included on a CD-ROM; you have to download it from the web. Give me a CD any day.
4,Comprehensive review of Delphi 4,I had a chance to skim this book over several hours. I have experience with VB6 and wanted to understand what Delphi has to offer. There was some good discussion on the oo aspects of Delphi that appear to be superior to VB. There was also a good section on internet development and Active X control use. It gave me an unbiased point of comparison between VB and Delphi products.
1,Bad ...,bad ... I have nothing to add ... but you will find many other better products for sure ... just search before you chose this one
3,A story of love and sadness,"I loved the love story. The lovers' actions, bravery, falling for each other and being together was fabulous, but the book was too depressing and made me sad. It took place in a setting where white men tortured and killed Indians. Rebecca's husband was evil to the Indians and was abusive to her. There was much sadness throughout the book. Even though it had a happy ending, I felt sad at the end. I guess I prefer romance novels that don't leave me with tears."
4,Unbearably romantic.......( 4 1/2 stars),"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book! I have been on a real roll lately..reading keeper after keeper. ""This Fierce Loving"" was no exception. What a story! It was refreshing because it was so different from the masses of other romances that I have read. I so enjoyed the characters! Talon could not have been any sexier and Becca was strong without being annoying. The story surrounding them was not only romantic, but so action packed and exciting!! So why not 5 stars? I had a quibble. I didnt feel that the storyline involving Colin offered much closure...also, I thought that the ending conflict felt a bit rushed. Other than that..wow...what a keeper. Definitely one that Id recommend!"
4,Promising concept,"This biography covers the life span of China's greatest modern philosopher, who lived from the end of the Qing dynasty until the 1980s. Feng Youlan's accomplishments are an impressive boon to Chinese philosophy, and his biography is an interesting study in political history. Many of the passages in the 'philosophy' chapter are worthy of rereading. A must for any scholars of China and/or fans of memoirs!"
4,The Crystal Stair by Grace Chetwin,I Realy like this book and I am hoping to read more about Gom and Stormfleet and Gom's new master it is an exelent book and I hope you like it as much as I did.
3,Read The Earlier Novels First,"This book will not make much sense if you haven't readGOM ON WINDY MOUNTAIN (Tales of Gom in the Legends of Ulm, Book 1)andThe RIDDLE & THE RUNE. Purchased this as part of an ebay fantasy lot, and read it anyway... did not get much out of it. Chetwin re-introduces characters from books one and two nearly every chapter, and skimps on character re-description. If I'd read the first two books might not be a problem... but it was a problem. Couldn't picture the characters. These 'old friends' were unknowns for me. Much of the reunion drama between Gom and his mother in the early novel was also lost on me.Reading the earlier books is required for early immersion. I can only rate based on what I did read. Did like the ending, and I wouldn't mind reading the rest of this series."
4,Nephew loved it!,My 3 yr old nephew loved the monkeys. It was last year's Christmas present & still looks new considering he plays with it all the time.
1,HUGE,"It is truly a beautiful watch but this thing is ""HUGE"". I actually returned it . Much to big for my taste."
2,Sent it Back,"Pretty watch. Nice Packaging. Entirely to big for your average Joe. Purchased for my 18 year old son and we sent it back as it looked like he was wearing a small appliance. We all wear ""oversized watches' but this one took the cake when it comes to size. Just too big even though we measured according to specs, it sat off the wrist much to high and made this pretty watch look rather cheap."
2,monotony,"he managed to turn a seemingly nice blend into just over an hour of monotonous bass kicks, claps & clicks. Even though there are some good artists here, and with the exception of 2/3 tracks, the mix makes them all sound the same; it's like hearing a one hour long song. I guess it's one of those cool-to-dance-to-but-not-listening CDs (I fell asleep to it). I'd go for individual albums, or another compilation."
2,"Great music, but I hate this sound.","This 2Cd contains some great performances of this absolutely best orchestra ever. I love first version of The Mooche with Baby Cox and Hot & Bothered too. Harlem twist not first but one of the best versions of East St. Louis Toodle-oo. Great version of Mood Indigo and Black and Tan fantasy without Bubber Miley.And first version of great Rockin'in Rhythm.This is a essential music for every fans of early jazz.But!!! sound on this double cd is one of the worst I ever heard.Absolutely muted, no clarity, no high tones, no drums.I recorded some songs (Rockin'in Rhythm, The Mooche, Harlem Twist) in Austrian radio station and sound on my cassette is 100% better than on this 2Cd.I hope then this recordings in future will be release in better form than on this Cd."
1,Terrible mastering. Ellington deserves much better,"The mastering credits of this collection credit Tim Geeland and Larry Keyes for this mess. May your names live in shame forever. Its criminal what they did to these recordings. Terrible noise reduction job that kill these recordings and make them sound like coming from a closed garage.That being said, there are some great moments of Ellingtonia in here, probably not my favorite period, but worthy specially to hear the best versions of the Mooche, and Black Beauty, Jubilee Stomp and Rockin in rythmn.Sorry for the low rate, but the sound is horrible. Maybe Sony will remaster this set soon properly."
5,absolutly essential for any true jazz fan,THIS COLLECTION OF EARLY WORK BY THE GREAT AFRICAN AMERICAN PERFORMER DUKE ELLINGTON GOES RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE GREAT LOUIS ARMSTRONGS HOT FIVES SESSIONS. THIS ALBUM GIVES JAZZ FANS AND NEW COMERS A HISTORY LESSON IN AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC. THE SONGS ARE SHORT BUT VERY RICH IN TEXTURE AND COMPLEXITY. DUKE ELLINGTONS TRUE GENIUS SHOWS IN THESE EARLY SESSIONS MOST BEING PERFORMED AT THE WORLD FAMOUS COTTON CLUB.A JAZZ ESSENTIAL!!
2,Feminist Deconstruction of Myth,"I haven't much to add to previous reviews except a personal response to the text. Yet another tough book to comment on due to its translated form, Christa Wolf attempts to rewrite a myth from a female perspective and turn the Iliad on its head. The first person stream of consciousness is like a cloud that passes over that period in history, soaking up the facts we know and sprinkling them back down on us in digest form. Cassandra is not so much concerned with its own myth as picking and choosing focal points ripe for re-focusing from a modern feminist perspective (sexuality, the male heroes and their brutality, the reality of war, the mind-control of politics). Although Interesting, and possibly even poetic in its native tongue, Cassandra is more curious as an academic project than a piece of literature."
1,Adds insult to the heroine's injuries.,"I love the legends of the prophetess Cassandra, and even adopted her name as my own nom de plume. So, I started out quite biased towards this telling over the more warrior-worshipping, male-centric standard retellings of the Trojan War. I wanted to like this book.Unfortunately, the author has a serious case of academic cramp. A drier, less gripping account of a woman scorned, raped, ripped from her homeland and her love, could not be found. Even I couldn't care about this Cassandra.As for the essays, they are about as lucid as a batch of Los Angeles rush-hour smog. They appear to be feminist, more or less, in a sort of cryogenically literary way.At first I was inclined to give the book two stars, because the idea is good though the execution is sour. Then I realized that by penning this travesty the author stole the chance from all other writers to tell the same story as it should be told. Hence, I give this book the lowest of all possible ratings."
4,You can not stop reading this book- you'll get lost,This complex novel is one of the best retellings of greek history that I have found. The only problem with it is that you can't put it down for fear of losing her train of thought.
3,Basic set but with two reservations...,"This is a basic fireplace set, as you would expect from the price. The construction is hefty solid metal and it has a fairly simple, sleek look. However, the design of the tongs in this set is a bit lacking in that the handle parts don't lock together, or set into place in a secure way at all. So I ""fixed"" it by putting some black electrical tape in the right spot so it sticks in place, but without that the tongs would often fall open while hanging on the stand. Secondly, the brush we got is not the same as the nice, rustic looking brush pictured with this set. The brush we got is a boring little black square block at the bottom with black bristles attached. It works fine and was not enough of a disappointment to return it, just be aware that if you really care about that particular brush style, it's not what you're going to get.It's simple and works fine (with minor modifications) and not quite as advertised--3 stars in my book."
4,nice...,easy to assemble and seems very nice... the poker is better than most as it is one piece and not one that unscrews when using... arrived earlier than expected as well by 3 days... this helps as the storm is about to come in tonight....
3,"Let the record stand corrected, exclamation point!","I wrote a review for this collection previously and, unfortunately, did the (common?) mistake of confusing Jeff with Marty. I was recalling 20 years ago and spaced! I'm glad to see that Jeff himself wrote in and pointed this out because he deserves the credit. Hello Jeff."
1,Horrible Product,"This is one of the worst products I've ever touched. I expected the something similar to the temporary tattoos one would buy at a toy store or get in a box of crackerjacks. Instead this product is more like a very complicated sticker. You print to one sheet (making a blurry image), then transfer to a second sheet that you apply to your body with the aid of the typical wet sponge. Rather than the ink transfer you'd expect, you get a clear sheet of plastic glued to your arm. Not only was the result not what I expected, but within 2 hours my suffocating skin began turning blue and red. When I removed the tattoo, merely two hours after application, I was left with a bruise for days and a red mark lasting for weeks. This is a horrible product and I think it would be dangerous to children. Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your money."
1,Terrible product,"The tattoos turn out terrible. I wasted my time coming up with some team artwork to put on these, then made some. It is more like a clear sticker on the arm, not like a tattoo. And it doesn't stick very well. I won't use them."
3,not bad for what it is,"in spite of previous reviews here from people who can't seem to read, where it says right on the package 'body STICKER tattoos', or complain that it's not ink transfer (which would be rather dangerous using inkjet ink, which would have more allergic reactions than the film these use), The product is exactly as it claims to be, and can be used for more than jsut a body tattoo. I have used them as window decals, notebok decorations, and many other things.If you're looking for ink transfer tattoo's.. you'll be spending a fortune for a special machine and ink, with a stencil kit...all quite costly and time consuming. For simple removable body art, as this states it is, this product serves the purpose."
1,Not a good deal in my opinion,"There's no actual art included in the package, just the Tattoo paper. You'll need to find clip art from somewhere else, copy and paste to another program in order to make an entire sheet of the Tatto's before it's worth printing. There's probably a lot better product on the market that would be more user friendly."
4,great little stories,"This is a collection of Irish tales having to do with worriors, princesses, and wizards. As an adult listener I didn't know what to expect but after hearing the stories on this CD I was drawn in. The second story in particular is a favorite of mine but all are good. If you love fantasy stories full of adventure and magic give this collection by Naxos a try."
3,Strange power choices,"Although this is an AGP card, the power connector which is requiredto run the card, is a six-pin slot. Most, if not all AGP motherboardsuse power supplies with four-pin connectors. I had to use two Y-adaptersoff my hard drives to connect to a power adapter which converted toa six-pin connector. Ended up buying 3 adapters just so I could usethe card. Very poor engineering, in my opinion."
1,defective video card,"When I got the box of this video card already was damaged and the box waspartialy crushed,opened the box and found that video card has damaged on one of the CAP and one of the Coil.installed the video card and some of the game wouldfreez up and could not play.I am in touch with Diamond the Manufacurer to send me a new video cardRMA # has not been issue yet pending Diamond Tech support final E-mailwith RMA #.I am not Happy yet, till try new video card.Diamond Viper ATI X1950PRO AGP 512MB Video Card"
3,Good card if you are lucky,"Ok, the card is a big improvement over my old X850XTPE. I ca play at high resolutions and frame rates. This makes the AGP card live for another 6-12 months longer. The downside is that this card can have issues if you get a bad one. Especially with the cooling since it seems the cooler isn't mounted firmly enough or something which makes it create artifact (memory related)."
2,Another Rushed PSP Title,"Clearly 989, under pressure from Sony, rushed this game to market with little or no QA and testing. A good review of the rules of basketball - particularly the ridiculous back-court violations that occur in this game following blocked shots would have been a good start. Additionally, better play calling capabilities would make the game a bit more intelligent. Its fun and the graphics are good - but the being able to lob the ball the length of the court to Ray Allen who will hit a three everytime isn't the best mark of game design. Lot's of silly glitches and errors in this game and no attention to detail - players names aren't announced, no play-by-play put this game well below the standards set by other sports titles."
1,Terrible game,"This is the worst NBA game I have ever played in my life. The gameplay is terrible, the options are terrible, just about everything is. I wasted 30 bucks on this."
3,needs work,"Who designed this game? They didn't seem to get all the rules right. For instance what they consider a backcourt violation is totally wrong, when an opposing player knocks the ball out of your hand and you retrieve it in the backcourt, that should not be a violation. Get the rules right and this game could be better. Playcalling is also not so great."
1,Worse game i've played on the psp,"First off, my biggest complaint about the game is the precision shooting. Why not just press the button once and depending on a few variables (openess, players ability, or distance to the rim) the ball will go in or out. Instead you have to press the shot key twice. Also a turbo key would have been awesome. I don't think it is too much to ask as I recall the NBA Live games on PS1 had a turbo button. Obviously there are a few rules that the developers lost in translation as you can shoot the ball and have a long rebound travel back to the other side of the court and if you shot the ball you will be called for backcourt. The same goes for blocked shots and swipped balls that are touched by the opponent and travel across the half court line and then recovered by your team. I'm not exactly sure why anyone would by any sport game from this company and this game is no different."
4,Powerful infectious bass lines.......,"My first reaction to this CD was being captivated by the infectious bass lines, far more than any of the rest of the instrumentation. In much the same way that Keith Moon's drumming stood out to me when I first heard the Who (the ""Anyway Anyhow Anywhere"" 45). The material is very strong, witness the fact that the lead track, ""Any More Than I Do,"" was a B-SIDE when originally released. I had originally heard ""Created by Clive"" as performed by The Syn, but The Attack's version is far stronger, peppier and enlivened by the mallett percussion. Well, it says it's a mod collection but, at the risk of alienating purists, I would surely suggest that the psych and freakbeat minded would all find much to enjoy."
5,One of the best action actresses you'll ever come across,"I love way too many of these movies, but this one has everything I love from the genre and nothing that bothered me. Let's see how specific I can get... this is easily one of my favorite pre-Venom Mob Shaw Brothers films that doesn't have a one-armed hero. That still covers a lot of ground. It's actually a really well constructed story. Cheng Pei-Pei is not just a great action star (or action dancer if you'd prefer), but the best actress of the era I've seen. And hey, how about that -- Lo Lieh as a good guy. I was suspicious of him the entire time but only because he's usually a great villain."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Agency names and addresses. Answers to obvious questions. A few hints. Unfortunately, nothing else."
1,Garbage,"It's a pretty simple product, not much to review. It's big enough to layout a full cocktail set and keep everything contained. My only complaint is that is had a chemical rubber smell when I took it out of the bag, but this seems to be dissipating.Update: I have had the product for over a week now and the smell seems to have gotten worse, not better. In it's current state it is not usable. It has a very strong chemical smell."
1,Smells bad,"The bar mats look great, but they have a terrible smell that has permeated the glasses. We are in the process of washing them with vinegar and letting them sit outside to remove the smell. If this doesn't work, I will have to return them in a week."
1,Rubber tire smell Bar mat,"The product is stiff and will last forever, but the overwelming smell of tire rubber is unbelievable. I've washed it and even put in 155degree dishwasher no help.Don't put a glass upside down or it will taste like rubber also when you drink from it.Will probably get my money back if possible."
4,Solid product,"I bought two of these about 6 months ago. True to the other reviews, they have a very strong rubber smell. I initially did two different sessions of soaking in vinegar overnight and while I think it helped some, the smell is still sticking around. The bigger decrease in smell really only comes with time, which isn't fun to hear. But know that the smell eventually does decrease and hopefully will be gone completely one day. When that comes, all that is left is a _very_ solid product that I love having in my kitchen."
1,Stinks!,"Although warned in advance by other reviewers about the odor, the suggested ""treatment"" seemed reasonable so I purchased. The vinegar bath didn't work, nor did several different dish detergent soakings. Still had a strong rubber tire odor and it was much heavier than I thought it would be. Basically, it seemed a mini doormat and absolutely not for my kitchen/bar area. Even though I received free shipping I have to pay to ship it back. Unless you like that rubber tire smell, don't buy this."
5,Saved my table!,"I received this as a gift. SO PRACTICAL!!! This weekend I had a build-a-bar cocktail party and mass quantities of drinks were made over several hours on top of this mat. This mat caught all of the drips and spills (and by midnight there were many!). We started cleaning up at 2am and this mat was full of liquid - which meant NONE of the spills ended up all over my hardwood floors or under the mat causing damage to my table. If I could buy one of these in a 3x6 foot version to use as a table cloth, I would!"
2,Smell of this thing is NO JOKE. I'm not sensitive--this smells like a room full of steel-belted radials...,"I bought this and ignored the smell complaints. I figured they were people with upscale kitchens and houses and they were just looking for something to bitch about. That was a wrong assumption.The smell of this thing is astonishing. I tried all the tricks mentioned--I soaked it in vinegar water for over a week, and hung it outside for another week. The smell is STILL just crazy--it's makes any room its in smell like a tire store.Other than that it's fine--but I seriously don't see a way I can have this in my home. I am now trying running it in the dishwasher a few times to see what that does. I can't recommend something you have to spend this kind of effort on."
5,better than expected,"This is a great product! I was pleasantly surprised about its size, for some reason I wasn't expecting it to be so big, but that is great because it is the perfect size. I have it on top of a mini fridge near a bar made out of ikea furniture in my dorm at college and it gives it such a nice touch. It really makes it all come together! It is thick, sturdy, and grips good - I highly recommend it."
3,bar service mat,"Works well, and is just as it looks online. The only bad thing about this product is its strong smell of vulcanized rubber. My kitchen smelled like a tire shop for a few days after I opened it. I would recommend this product but just air it out before use."
3,Works great...smells bad.,"The product works as advertised, however the initial smell of rubber is overwhelming. I soaked it in vinegar for a day, allowed it to air dry outside over night, and soaked it in baking soda, and it still smells like new tires. When you turn your glassware upside down to dry, they WILL smell like rubber when you turn them right side up.I would still recommend the product, but beware of the smell."
1,Horrible Tire Smell,"So far this has a horrible tire smell. I used soap but that did not help. I plan to wash it a few more times with soap and will hope for the best. It is not clear which side to use this mat on... One side will absorb all the water, but fine tall crystal will not be balanced and will likely just get knocked over. The under side wont do anything helpful. Neither can't be used if the smell cannot go away. I will update the review once I have a good solution for the smell."
3,"Stinky, stinky!","I read the reviews for this mat regarding the tire/rubber smell and bought the mat anyway. If you have a clothes pin hooked on your nose, then this is a great mat! It is sturdy yet pliable and will be great for capturing spills in the bar area, that is, if the smell ever goes away. Boy, does it reek! I'm letting it air out now (which has smelled up the entire kitchen) and will trying soaking it in a vinegar solution later this week. Other reviews are correct that other items will absorb the odor as well. I mistakenly left a small mug on it overnight and now it too smells like tire. Good mat, but plan ahead. You will not want to use this out of the box. Hoping the vinegar works."
2,"no seriously, this thing really smells",I normally ignore reviews mentioning that an item smells. The scent tends to go away in a short time after the product is allowed to air out. That is not the case here. I assume oil is continuing to leech out of the rubber and provide the tire store aroma. Some people said putting it the dishwasher helped so I tried that and now I can't get the smell of rubber out of the dishwasher even though I have run it multiple times since. I suspect the oil has bonded to anything plastic inside the dishwasher. I suppose the item does work as you would expect but I think it is made out of cheap uncured rubber. There are others on Amazon which cost twice as much; are these simply from the same factory or are they a higher quality rubber? No idea. Give them a go and let us know eh? :)
4,"Nice Mat, good price. Smell not so good.","I read a lot of the reviews of these mats before making my purchase so just let me say I was aware of the smell issues. These are very nice quality, and work perfectly for what I need. I would purchase again if needed."
5,Great price and a GREAT mat!,It doesn't get much more professional then this. This is a really great deal and a great bar mat. I was pleasantly surprised on how thick and durable it is for the price. It's just like the one in the bar. Note the dimensions of course. But it really is a great product and I highly recommend it.
4,Great when sitting in a blind,"I've owned the Newcon Optik LRM 1200 rangefinder for several years. It's very accurate and responsive. The only thing I don't like about it, is that it is larger that I'd like to carry around all day. Hunting from stands or ground blinds is where I use them. Wouldn't hesitate to buy again if these ever went out. Oh, the battery seems to last forever."
1,Band broke in 2 days,"First, the little leather loop to hold the excess strap came off when I put the watch on for the second time. Then, the buckle came off the third time I tried to put it on. The watch piece is great, but the band I got was useless."
3,Watch Review,Watch was exactly as ordered but the band length was too long. I did not keep the original packaging so I am selling it on eBay. Seller sent watch right away and I would do business with the vendor again.
5,I love this watch!,I love this watch and bought it to replace one I lost. The only problem is the strap is too long and it hangs too loose around my wrist.
3,Battery dead?,"The watch is very easy to read and the long watchband fits great,but less than a month after receiving it the watch has stopped. I am hoping it is just a bad battery."
2,It's nice but the wrong color.,"I needed a brown watchband, and it is definitely black! I kept it,it's nice, I didn't want the hastle of returning, but needed to purchase another brown watchband."
1,Never know what time it is,"This watch has been losing time for months (so about 3 months into my owning it). I thought perhaps it was the battery (despite being fairly new and most watch batteries lasting for years), so I replaced it, but that has not helped. I never know if my watch is correct or 2-5 minutes slow. At one point it was losing hours (I assume it stopped). Then I know it stopped because I would notice that it was the same time for hours (but not until I was running very late for something, of course). Lately, it's just losing minutes a week. (I really need a new watch!)I'm very disappointed in this Timex and I've owned them for years and never had an issue like this."
2,timex watch,"I have always purchased Timex watches. This one looks very nice and I love the leather strap.However, it doesn't keep time. I runs 45 minutes behind after it is set. At the end of 24 hours it is a couple of hours behind. I am just too lazy to send it back!"
1,Not a good purchase,Bought the watch as a gift. I know the price is low and was set for not expecting too much. The Timex watch strap failed after a week. Of course Timex does not warrant the band. Poor quality at any price.
2,Great until it falls off,"nice looking, keeps good time, lights up at night, even water proof. If only it didn't fall off my wrist? The strap's metal tongue must be too short."
2,Watch fine. Strap worthless.,"I wore this watch for a couple of weeks. I never take my watches off, which has never been a problem with trusty ol' Timex Expeditions. In truth, the band always wears out long before the watch does. In fact, I've never had a watch wear out. And I wear them swimming, hot tubbing, showering, bathing, everything. But this one, the cheesy band broke in two weeks. I just ordered a new band for it for 13 dollars rather than return it and I got a good deal on the watch but it still peeves me."
3,evaluation,"This watch is quite good, it is very clear though is small. I like the clarity and light. Watch was purchased for an older lady. Given the price of this watch is fine"
2,Not quite what I expected.,"This is my second easy reader. I liked the idea of a date. Unfortunately although I can read the numbers easily, I cannot read the date. I also discovered it needs to be manually adjusted at the end of month. I'll go back to the easy reader without date next time."
5,Intellectual Forplay,The book was sent to me in very good condition and in a timely manner. I am enjoying the reading.
5,Awesome book for couples!,"My husband and I borrowed this book from a friend when we were first starting to date. Instead of watching a movie, we would pull out the book and ask each other questions. I'm convinced that this book helped lay a VERY solid foundation for our relationship. It is not my #1 piece of ""advice"" I give to newly engaged couples as they prepare for marriage. This was especially helpful in starting discussions on things we often take for granted or are uncomfortable discussing. This book covers just about every area of life, from childhood memories to views about money, household chores, kids, etc. The chapter on sex was VERY enlightening, as it opened discussion about something neither of us had been comfortable talking about.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone in a relationship, or wanting to be in a relationship."
1,Falls Apart Quickly; Used Cardboard Inside,"This is really a poor quality wallet, and I can't believe how many good reviews this item has gotten. Out of the box, the wallet looked nice. Three weeks later, the edges have worn away, exposing the fabric underneath, and the leather is peeling back from the cardboard inside. The leather looks and feels genuine, but it's truly the thinnest leather I have ever seen - as thin as a piece of paper. The inside of the wallet is re-used cardboard, and it looks like it was cut from an Indian cereal box - it still has the lettering and graphics from the box.From other reviews, I thought this was going to be a good product for the price. But I would have been much better off paying more for a better wallet."
1,Zippers ruin this product,"The pocket zippers distort the shape, color, and feel of the leather. This would be a five star rating without the zippers. I am embarrassed to show the wallet now because of the stains and the odd impressions on the leather."
1,Quick shipping of poor product,"Arrived quickly, but I found the product poor. One seam was not done well and came apart. The cash zipper broke just from opening it once. The pocket were very tight for my credit sized cards. It really is not worth sending it back as they want a $3.99 money order to pay for reshipping. Live and learn. I chose this wallet because of all the great reviews. Makes me wonder if they are real or plants."
4,I needed a wallet,I purchased this wallet because my other wallet I had was decommissioned. I wanted a wallet that was rust brown but no stores around me had the color I was looking for. The only thing that I had to do with this wallet is take out the ID flap and reinsert the other was so that I can easily display my ID. It feels sturdy and recommend this wallet to anyone who wants it.
4,sweet if slightly trite,"Mrs Miracle is the first of the Mrs Miracle series by Debbie Macomber. Widower of 4 years, Seth Webster, and his 6-year-old twins, Judd and Jason, are having a hard time holding onto a housekeeper. Seth's in-laws, Sharon and Jerry Palmer, seem headed for divorce after forty years of marriage. Travel agent, Reba Maxwell's mother is still insists on trying to reconcile her with her sister, Vicki, the sister who stole her fiancé 4 years ago. Christmas is approaching, but nothing seems to be going right. And then Emily Merkle turns up: she seems to have the answer to everyone's problems, with her cooking and advice and her reading to the boys. She seems heaven-sent, and the boys call her Mrs Miracle. Emily Merkle dispenses her wisdom in little ""bon mots"". This is a sweet if slightly trite tale which explores the plight of the widower, a marriage gone stale and the need for forgiveness. An enjoyable tale for the holiday season."
5,Mrs Miricle,I enjoyed the interaction between the characters. The story line was very serious and yet amusing all at the same time. Mrs Miricle was a delight that gave you the feeling there are really angels in our life that help us through the things we are going through. Debby McComber writings can be very helpful in your everyday life as you see her characters struggling with living out life.
5,"A fun, uplifting story.",I looked forward to sitting down with the story at every opportunity. Mrs. Miracle was an easy read with a heart warming story. You'll find that you know many of the same type characters.
5,It will be great,All of Debbie Macomber's Christmas novels are great reads. I won't read it until the holidays but I know it will be great.
1,Poorly written and Repetitive,"Just tried to read this book, and found it to be very poorly written. I guess the New York Times list doesn't require authors to know how to write anymore. The story is written at a fifth grade level, and the author is very repetitive. She belabors points up to four times, for no reason I can see. Perhaps she's being paid by the word. Her characters are good, and feel very believable as I read, but the story didn't hold my attention, the character's problems seemed picayune and silly.Before I was halfway through, I grew bored and tired of all the religious preachiness of this book, and threw it in the garbage. True story!"
5,Great holiday read!,"Good, heartwarming Christmas story. Debbie Macomber fans will love it. Can't wait to watch the movie now on TV to compare."
3,IT'S OK,I was looking for a good Christmas story. Why was the profanity added? It was totally unnecessary and will keep me from buying any more of Ms. Macomber's books.
1,this is an old edition,"The authors are publishing virtually identical books under different titles. For instance, ""How to Write a Winning Scholarship Essay"" and ""Money-Winning Scholarship Essays and Interviews"" are virtually identical (I could find only some minor differences in chapter 4). These two books have completely different covers. Beware: There may be other duplicated titles."
3,"Clear, basic introduction","This undergrad text is extremely clear, with lots of examples and exercises. I thought the coverage was a bit limited, even for an undergrad text and the writing style is kind of dry. Still, it's perhaps even easier than Kreyszig."
2,Production spites itself,"2 1/2Pretty tired, but not completely drained, gym-inducing techno will bore many idm-freaks with generic beat-making, dated sampling, and pseudo-sexy vocals, though adds mildly satisfying melody, noticeable variety, and enough subtle tweaking to break up a thumping monotony for house-heads."
5,are you serious,"""mourning wood"". surly this guy realizes the joke. make sure to get the HARDcover version."
5,Much more saw than I expected,"I was originally a little leery of purchasing a reconditioned saw, but after receiving this saw, I sure am glad that I made the purchase.The saw comes delivered in a well packaged box and was heavier than I expected. After setting it up and making some minor adjustments, it was ready to go! Although reconditioned, you wouldn't know it but for the sticker showing that it was reconditioned in Mexico. Cuts are smooth, however, if you are going to miter trim, you should invest in a better blade. The blade included in the saw is good for most cuts, but a blade with more teeth would be better for trim work.Single bevel is nice and more than adequate for the DIYer. However, if you are going to use the saw professionally, you may want to invest in dual bevel sliding.Overall, a GREAT saw. Now I just need more projects to use it."
2,Out of Square,"Although I have 3 other DeWalt 10"" miter saws that I'm quite pleased with, this one has a new design. I think it's more for a homeowner than a professional. When setting up the machine, it was impossible to get it to cut square from both sides. When cutting a 3 1/2"" high piece upright, when adjusted square from the right, it would not be from the left and visa versa. In addition, when you bring the saw back up to it's resting position, you can feel the base disc moving up and down. I don't like it at all and have relegated it to work that is not critical."
4,Great Miter Saw! Great Price!,"This saw worked like new, and looked new after taking it out of the packaging. I'm not a professional just a do-it-yourself guy that has a house that needs lots of trim work.This saw cut thru MDF, composite, and real wood like a knife thru butter. The table was flat and sturdy. All adjustments to the bevel and miter felt precise without slop in the joints. All parts and accessories were included along with the instructions. It cut square and precise, I did not need to adjust anything (I checked before first use). Also has the ability to attach the DeWalt laser system incase you want to add that later!4 stars because I am comparing this to other miter saws I have used that cost more then twice a much. For a do-it-yourself person this saw is more then you will need. And at this price you can't beat it. I'll be buying more 'reconditioned' DeWalt tools if this level of quality maintains."
4,Good saw at a great price.,"Bought this saw to use on a pile of maple flooring. It handled it very nicely. The blade that came with it could have been a little better, but over all it seems to be a great saw especially at this price."
5,Best value for the money,"I was leery of buying a reconditioned saw ($197.00 + free shipping!)but this one is great. It is like brand new out of the box and miter and bevel are accurate out of the box. It does not come with a laser but that can be bought separately. Worked great on 2 X 8 and 2 X 6 decking. If you are looking for a 12 inch saw in this price range, don't buy that junk from Sears or Harbor Freight. I wish it came with a higher tooth count blade but this one is OK(40 tooth). I'm not doing crown moulding anyway. This is the only time I would buy DeWalt stuff. Generally I think they are over priced but the quality is decent. If it ever has a problem at least you can get parts. BTW, this is a Type 1 saw. I guess they have different types ( type 2, 3...)that are better even though it's the same model number. Do a search on type 1 saws. They had a recall issue years ago but that's been fixed. Anyway, this is a great saw for a homeowner ( who knows, maybe even a pro)."
5,exactly what I wanted,"A factory reconditioned dewalt compound miter saw? Exactly what I wanted, and at a discount! I would have bought a used saw locally if I could have found one that didn't look/sound like it fell off the back of a truck."
5,A Nightmare on Elm Street,"I've been playing this game since I wore diapers (I'm serious). This is really fun and entertaining. I love it! The only down side is with muliple players. If you have a really good player and a bad one, you will most likely end up losing your soul to Freddy. The reason for that is that the two people need to be in the screen. No split screens in this game. For information on the game, it is roughly based on the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Another version, but completely different, was released for Commodor 64 & PC. Just to wrap this up, it is a great game even with poor graphics, (give the designers a break! they didn't have high-tech HD computers and fancy tools like today) so give it a chance and play. You won't regret."
3,What is up with Hip Hop,"The first album Joc put out was on point but the new 1 isnt what i thought it would be , see some times u have to stick with whats workin, and that is keepin what made u successful around till it aint workin out no more. i see alot of hip hop artist switchin up for no reason and it is hurtin them instead of helpin them. Hope next album is like the first. Peace"
1,it should be free!,Young Joc owes me money for buying this garbage! 1 song on the whole CD! he is lucky i like his voice and that one song!
3,Not a Spidey fan?,"I'm not really a Spidey fan or any kind of superhero fan? But I was hoping that in Spider Man 3 would include Spiderman and his Amazing Friends which was a cartoon TV series from the 1980's which included Spiderman best friends Iceman and FireStar. Iceman who has the ability to freeze anything and everything and FireStar who is a female who can fly and light up fires much like Pyro from XMen but Firestar can fly. I'm not saying they should make a Spiderman 4 because its getting tiresome already. The funny thing is horror movie sequels are always labeled as stupid but I think superhero sequels and action and comedy sequels are the stupidest of all the genre sequels. Horror movies always have a double standard and comedy, action, superhero sequels are never ever labeled as stupid. Hello Star Trek Part 10 or Die Hard Part 4 and James Bond Part 20. Like how many freaking times does Mary Jane need to be saved?"
2,Spider-Man 3,"Such a big let down after #2. To many villians, it should of just been Spider-Man vs. Sandman and Harry. I agree with most fans the black suit-Venom story needed its own movie."
1,Definitely the worst of the trilogy,"My biggest gripe is this: What's up with the director making Peter do fight scenes without costume or a mask? Sacrilege! This is supposed to be about a superhero. Spidey is cool, Parker isn't. You can infect him with a simbiot if you want, but Parker will still be a geek. In fact, the only thing worse than a geek is a geek who THINKS he is cool. Parker is the Charlie Brown of superhero alter egos, and will always be. That is what gives him his appeal, a lovable loser. To put him center stage over the Webslinger absolutely killed this film, special effects be darned. And Harry's character as a supervillian? Trifling at best. Stupid plot, and a waste of my money. Take my advice: Unless you are a comic fan ala the Trekkies, rent this...don't buy it."
2,I don't understand the HOOP LA over Blu Ray,I love the Spider-Man series. I don't understand why Blu-ray costs so much more than a regular DVD.
1,Pure trash,"I am not a Spiderman fan but have seen all 3. The second is by far the better out of all 3, and this is definetely the worst. The overblown, boring sappy story is pathetic and being the length it is, I was squirming halfway through, and I never do that. The 'enemies' were laughable, especially Sandman, who was utterly and completely pointless. Toby Maguire is so whiny in this( though that is pretty typical of him in this role). I will not even start on Kirsten Dunst. The one decent thing is the effects. But then again, I've seen it all before, so, nothing new. I would probably never watch this again."
1,BORING!,"Terribly, boring. Computer effects look cheesy. I wish Aunt Mae and Mary Jane would die already. Clumsy script. It's like every minute you watch feels like ten excruciating minutes. Couldn't care less about any of the characters and I'm a Sam Raimi fan. Tobey Macquire looks ill. It's two and a half hours long. I could go on and on like this movie but I think you get the point. You want a great super hero movie rent Batman Begins or Xmen2. daredevil is even better."
1,"Wow, that was bad.",Spiderman 1 was terrible. Didn't see Spiderman 2 and I saw the 3rd one on a 13 inch tv on a cruise. Don't waste your money on this.
3,Spiderman 3 - Great Action Flick,Great action movie to watch in high definition with surround sound. The kids love it!
3,Spectacular special effects but not as touching as Spiderman 2,This move has spectacular special effects. One of the best fighting scenes is between Sandman and Spiderman. I found it's not as touching as Spiderman 2.It's worth renting.
4,Blu-Ray disc (not a movie review),"I won't even try to review the movie, I enjoyed it and loved the bountiful special features on the Blu-ray version. The main thing I wanted to point out is that some Blu-ray players take a long time to load the Spiderman 3 movie disc (with a ""loading"" bar repeated moving across the screen for 1 minute or so). At first I thought my disc was defective due to this. I don't know if this will be a trend for Blu-ray discs, but this is the first out of about 20 that I have noticed this extended load time."
4,spidey rocks,"I don't know why all the fuss, people like me have waited since we were crazed teens to see these movies, do you think ,conventional wisdom would have generated these images? I'm just glad their around,Myself personally ,I would like to see all origins for superheroes/villains ,to be formatted around the original stories, this makes it better for the ones who read from the beginning,and know the true nature of their origins, parts 2and3 of said movies can be where ideas can be bent. Watch what they do to THOR, because they think no one is paying attention to the details, of the character . I hope trial of the gods would be put in with a true scripting of how thor became. Folks look, spidey rocks, and so do all marvel heroes. nuff said"
4,Spider-Man 3,"""Spider-man 3"" was fairly enjoyable, featuring a fine set of villains, and a story in line with the previous films, though I do feel the whole ""black-suit"" thing went on for a bit long and that the Venom scenes (which I was looking forward to the most) were a bit rushed, as was Venom's character development. The ending was a little up in the air in some ways too. A little under 4 stars, I think."
2,Such a waste.,"Dedicate most of the movie to drama that would make Lifetime proud. Then give Venom (one of the greatest villains ever) very little screen time and have him played by a 90 lb weakling because thats what Sam wanted. Then have Sandman make his appearance as a third rate Mummy sequel. The effects will be looked back on in emberassment, I felt like I was watching somebody play a Spider-man game on Playstation 3. And lets not forget the ""greasy hair nerd becomes a ladies man when he dances down the street"" scenes. Who directed this abomination Joel Schumacker? Maybe Spidey should get nipples on his costume like ole Bats did. Heres hoping Spidey 4 gets a new cast (maybe get a pretty female lead to play MJ the Model this time) and a new director who won't make these types of mistakes. I'm so sick of the back and forth Petey and MJ ""do you love me"" crap."
4,From someone who never read the comics...,"I really liked this movie. Peter Parker's ""emo-ness"" is less than appreciated, but I enjoyed the positive message at the end."
3,too high,they really reached for the stars on this one. too many bad guys and not enough of the bad guys that we wanted to see. i have to give this movie credit though. spiderman 3 is the first time that i watched a superhero movie and i actually wanted the hero to lose. if he died at the end i would not have been upset. there is nothing worst then someone who whines for 140 minutes. the three minutes of the movie when he is actually in the alien suit is the best part of the movie.
3,Ok Sequel,"We bought this because we have the first two movies, but they were much better movies than this third one. Not sure I'd buy a fourth if/when they make it."
3,spidey3,# 3 is full of visual delights. Unfortunatley the plot leaves you wanting more substance. It was fun to see Tobey be dark.
4,Just a very good movie,"This is family entertainment!I've loved comic books sinceI was very young.Here Spiderman comes alive for the third time.As with Superman before him, all his secretsare getting out.It isn't an easy world for a superhero...As usually good special effects, butyou can pretty well tellwhere real film ends and blue screen begins."
4,Psycological Thrill,"Schizophrenia is uncommon among the general population, but this movie brings it to the forefront of discussion."
2,Very disappointing,What a great concept to have the dark side of spidey come out. Unfortunately it seemed more of a comedy than an action thriller. Storyline was lame and unfortunately poorly filmed. They threw this one together with not much thought to executing a potentially strong storyline.
3,Weakest in the trilogy but fun.,"I suppose if any franchise goes on long enough it loses steam. Whether is it the actors portraying the heroes or the writers running out of ideas, inevitably thr third chapter in comic book sagas is always the weakest. First of all there are too mnay stories goign on here. Sandman is a waste of time. Venom is a miscast Topher Grace. The black suit idee was fun but too over the top with Tobeys dancing and goth looks. Dont get me wrong Mr Mcguire is still after three films fun to watch and he gives it his all, but the film tries to resolve so mnay issues that it becomes a mess and fallas apart. So three stars fro the acting and effects and Tobey and James Franco. But sadly to many cooks in the kitchen ruined what is am entertaining film"
3,can someone please tell me what happened?3.5stars,"oh my god...............why did these producers do venom this way? i mean.......this movie was a major disappointment! venom deserved his own movie with spiderman like boring goblin and dr oct! everybody who came to the movies had on venom shirts and everything, and we all left the movies shaking our head like....what happened? venom was completly nothing like the comic's! his role was short,and he even didn't introduce his self as venom! but other then the let down to all of venom fans,the movie was still a good movie! it had alot of humor,romance,great battles,and a little to much crying!"
3,"Too much crying. Why are you crying, Spiderman?","Great action. Good plot. Cool villians. A little more sentimentality than I expected. There are too many tear-eyed scenes. First Spiderman had the right blend of sentimentality, heart and action. The second one dealt with some angst, overcoming and great action. The third put too much sentimentality. There are legitimate scenes that call for the tears, but the film was rank with weepy-ville. Peter Parker is crying. Sandman is crying. May Jane is Crying. Harry Osborune is crying. Puh-lease.Highly entertaining but borderlining on sappy."
3,The Third Placed Third,"Overall, Spider-man 3 was a good movie. The action and character development rivaled the first two movies and, despite some inconsistencies, continued the story after the end of Spider-man 2. If story is what you're going for you won't be disappointed.However, as much storyline as they packed into the movie, it seemed rushed. And Raimi sure had fun ""emo""tizing Peter Parker after the symbiote got a hold of him. His quirky directing came out (in the form of a couple one-liners and a few awkwardly silly scenes) more in this film than the first two--a plus for Raimi fans, but not so much for Spidey fans who wouldn't so much expected it.All-in-all, though i very much enjoyed the movie, but it'd be rated below the Spider-man, which i would rate below Spider-man 2. So the third placed third."
5,A Triple Play,"IF this is the last Spiderman Movie, it totally went out with a bang! Toby and Kristin were great, as well as the FX. Definitely worth getting."
3,Kept my dad quiet,"I bought my dad a D.V.D for christmas as i live in the south and he lives up north i got it delivered via Amazon. To my amazement when i went for a visit shortly after New Year. The D.V.D was on my parents table in the box. The cheeky Bugger said ""i dont think i will enjoy that film can you get me spiderman 3"" I was livid as i had bought him a present and the gratitude is that..... Anyway he already had spiderman 3 but not on blue ray so i took his home with me returned the other film and sent him a replacement. Anyway he is much happier. Not sure how he will feel this year as he is getting nowt from me the ungratefull swine.Hope you all enjoy the film as much as my Dad does. I watched the normal version and its a top film....... Im gonna get the Bluray version next time im up north ha ha ha"
3,Only 3 stars for Spider Man 3,"Even though Spider Man 3 has way too much going on, it feels like you get two movies in one. There are many flaws and contrivances throughout, but still mildly entertaining and seems like a fitting way to end this trilogy."
3,Unimpressive Blu Ray,Movie is great as most of you already watched it but blu ray conversion isn`t that much .If you `ve keen eyes you can see green screen effects during fight sequence especially first and last.They din`t seem to immerse as one screen shot and layering effect is visible .Sound and music conversion is great .I paid less then $5 on like new copy but don`t over pay for it as there are better movie options available on blu ray that`ll worth extra dollar.
4,Good Movie....Not great!,I really liked it......Just got a little corny at times.....What I don't like is they have sort of taken away from the darkness of the comic book.....My favorite superhero though!
3,"Good action, bad story","As seems to be a common thread in reviews of Spiderman 3, I have to say that there is way too much going on in this movie. Spiderman just fights off one bad guy after another. There are so many different plots happening at once that we aren't given a chance to care about any of them.I'm not going to pretend that the villains in the first two movies were realistic (this is a comic after all), but at least there was a good story surrounding the creation of those villains, here we just have the bad guys falling from the sky, literally.Plenty of good mindless action though, if that's your pleasure. It's really not a bad movie, it just feels like they spent too much time adding characters and not enough time writing stories about them."
2,Not very well done..,"I rented this the other day and was really looking forward to seeing it.Spiderman 1 was great, and 2 was excellent. 3, however, has too many villians, not enough action, and too much drama. I felt like my wife put on the Lifetime Network for a while. Sandman was hardly in the film, andthe whole scene with Tobey dancing down the streets was EMBARRASING to watch. Don't waste your time on this one. Let's hope 4 is a better one!"
1,SpiderMan3 - product not in case,"Received the item just fine. No probably with receiving shipment; however, the case was sealed when it arrived but there was no disc/movie in the holder."
4,Long Awaited Spider-Man 3,"This movie had a lot of hype built up about it, well too many conflicts happening at once, and just not enough time for all of them. Best to lower your expectations before watching this!"
4,Threes the charm....,This is the best one made so far. The love triangle was a little weird but the rest of the movie was great.
3,#3 was my first Spiderman,"My arachnophobic husband never wanted to go, so I went with a friend. I'm renting #1 and #2 and I'll probably find out just what I missed. I know superhero films are going to be full of CGI, but so many morphing and melting characters villains got tiresome. The jazz club scene was cute, but just that--I could have seen it as an extra on the DVD and been amused, but for the most part it detracted from the main storyline at a critical point.This was a fun film to see larger than life on the screen, but I'm not sure Spiderman 3 would translate well to anything but a very high-end home theatre system."
1,CURSING!,"Although the rating does not state that the DVD contains language, IT DOES! Therefore, if you are concerned about the language, then do not purchase this DVD! I am returning mine to the store because it should have stated language so I would have not bought the DVD!"
5,Fantastic,"Movie arrived just in time for my 12 year son's birthday party.It was a big hit, along with the spider cake!"
1,Ruined COLLECTOR EDITION Coverbox With A DUMB Sticker - Thoughtless!,"This was a gift for my brother, he loved the movie but the bad part of this purchase was that it came with a large circular sticker on the very cool 3D effect cardboard coverbox! Have companies become this thoughtless - I ask you, would you like your COLLECTOR'S coverbox to have a LARGE neon ACTION sticker on it that cannot be removed without ruining the COLLECTOR'S EDITION box. Absolutely moronic!!!"
2,Well...,"In my opinion, Spiderman 2 and 3 were a huge dissapointment. Do not waste your time and money on this DVD, this movie was terrible. I saw this in theatres, hoping it to be really good, but no, it wasn't. It was all just [..]. Don't get it. Maybe worth a rent though."
1,No Cigar baby.,"When is enough, enough? These comic book movies and their sequels are like recycled garbage at this point. This film bordered on pretentiousness, like a blood sucking viper it drained the life out of me. I'm not down with the whole ""spidey"" thing, and all the bouncing off buildings and loud thuds and bangs? It's like does spider man drive a camaro? Wink, wink. It's like, get a life and start on a new action hero like Green Lantern or anybody at this point. When they make movies like Spider Man 3, they keep repeating the same actions and expecting different results at the end. Both me and my roomate literally fell asleep through this, but at different times, me first and then him. I don't need to see the rest of the film, you couln't PAY me."
2,Spideys Gettin' Boring,Spiderman is getting a little stale. Him and snaggle tooths relationship is boring. Not bad but not as good as number 1.
2,"Just like Spiderman, not up to par",Once again the Spiderman movie fell short on being entertaining. It shall be filed away with 1 and 2 never to be watched again.
3,OK!!,This is the weakest of the Spiderman flicks. I was expecting more. But this film falls victim to the Hollywood sequal syndrome. That's where they have to make everthying bigger and pack more villains and action scenes in. Then there is the subplot of Mary Jane seeming to fall out of love with Spiderman and wanting to go off on her own. They spent way too much time on that. I found the whole concoction not to my liking. Also the Blu-Ray transfer looked cheap to me. I wouldn't want to show it to anyone unless they really asked to see it.
2,The least favorite...,"the story of this spider mas 3 is really confusing...the movie really fail to bring VENOM to the story, and the sand man is like a crying baby figure....Not a good one...Wait for the next one with the LIZARD..."
2,This could (and should) be the end of Spiderman !!!,"Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad ""Three's company"" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1 & 2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1 & 2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system."
2,Spidey Sense a Miss,"The first two Spidey films rank among comic book films' best efforts. Unfortunately, the third film suffers the same fate as every other ""third"" super hero movie (and for that matter almost every trilogy - third film therein - ever made) - poor story, writing, direction and sub-poar performances.The hd quality of this disk is magnificant and is great to watch on a big tv with surround sound.Let's hope they make a fourth (with a new creative team) and we see Spidey actually capture Sandman (like in separate story at the beginning - think James Bond type of films), fight Kraven on his honeymoon in the jungle (think Al Swarengen/Ian McShane as Kraven - how great would that be?) and maybe the Lizard as well.Now that would be a cool fourth film. Time to leave NY and set the adventure elsewhere with new writers, directors, and the like."
1,If you wanna know what pian is...,"I'm absolutely baffled by this movie. How could it be so painfully boring? I mean, it's got the same director, the same charqcters as the last two, which are completely enjoyable, unlike this one. I beg, that someone please just erase this from existence and do the proper ""part 3."" Really, it's that bad."
5,Felizzz,Felizzz con esta edicion la esperaba asi muchooo tiempo.La recomiendo completamente.Muchas gracias!I love it!! !! !! !!
4,Fast 2:20,"Personally, I liked SpiderMan 3. The characters were more thoroughly developed in this script. I'm not emotionally attached to the series so I can overlook any flaws. Just relax and enjoy the movie."
2,worst of Raimi's Spiderman movies,"Review originally posted in 2007Updates made in 2010Spiderman 3 is my least favorite of Raimi's Spiderman movies. It suffers, not only from the same lame humor that I found to be annoying in Spiderman 2, but also from being over-stuffed with too many new characters (3 villains plus a second love interest)."
4,More positive messages from the Spidey's saga,"My son and I love watching it together. SM was my idol as I was growing up, and now he is so also for my son. Good movie!"
3,Not super great but worth seeing,"As has been stated in many other reviews, too many villains and a hectic plot. Special effects were great and the performances were all up to par with the other two movies. I don't regret the purchase but I am a little tired of Ramie's work for awhile. Tired of seeing Ramie's brother and Bruce Campbell do their little parts. I'd like to see another evil dead movie maybe.........I hope he leaves spidey alone for a generation now."
2,Looked good but wasn't,The trailers for this movies had me excited to see the 'darker' side of Spider-Man. I was sorely disappointed. What could have been a good film was made mediocre by the choppiness and the fact that they crammed two villains into the script. They should've spent more time fleshing out one or the other but instead did a wretched job at painting the story. It was too long and too boring to work. Too bad they hacked up the franchise with this dud.
5,Outstanding excellent ultimate amazing wonderful,In spiderman 3 spiderman fights the sandman. Spiderman gets the Black suit and fights the sandman in the sewer. The sandman turns to mud.Peter fights Harry with the Black suit. Harry throws a Goblin bomb at Peter. Peter dodges it he throws it back at Harry his half of his face blows up.Harry and spiderman fight Venoem and sandman. Harry deafeats the sandman. Harry saves Spider man and dies by the blade. from venom. Spiderman throws a Goblin ball at the Black suit. The End. A must see movie.
3,Where was the editor??,"Not as good as the first Spider-Man movie. At times I wondered why certain scenes where left in the movie. The Spider-Man parade scene was relatively lame. Even worse, however, was Peter Parker strutting down the street like a bad John Travolta out of ""Saturday Night Fever."" Finally (and I won't spoil it), the ending confrontation was really weak. You would think that with 40+ years of Spider-Man material from the comics, they could do better. Watch it before you buy it on DVD. I don't know how many times I could take this movie. Overall grade - a C."
2,Spiderman 3 is the worst movie in the trilogy!,"Spiderman 3 is the worst movie in the trilogy! this movie is very mean spirited and evil! the way Tobey Maguire acts in this movie is unsettling to watch! When Peter Parker/Spiderman gets the Venom outfit,he becomes bad! he tries to do terrible to get his revenge on Flint Marco aka the Sandman. The Black Spiderman suit looks good but It makes him bad. The love triangles are bad too! Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristin Dunst) break-up because Harry Osbourn (James Franco) interferes with their love relationship! Gwen Stacy also gets in the way of Peter Park and Mary Jane Watson. It was very bad and in poor taste.I would not recommend you buy this movie! This is a movie to rent not to buy! Spiderman 2 (2004) is the best movie in the Spiderman Trilogy!"
3,Don't buy it.,"As a huge fan of Spider-man 3 and deluxe super unnecessary edition DVDs I am warning you against this.Aside from its attractive cover (which is basically attractive because it's just a bit different from the normal one), what value does this have?Hardcore fans and movie buffs may like this one.But most fans, like me, should just wait for the Spider-man 3.X edition, which will probably have unseen footage and much more special features.Or spend an ebay-sized price on this and feel stupid when a real collectible edition comes out a few months from now."
2,i hate this movie,great picture sounds good i hate this movie the only good spiderman is the first2 and 3 were horrible
1,Not Happy At All,The description of the item did not specify that this was for a PSP. I was under the impression that it was a DVD. This seller needs to be more specific in his descriptions of items to include such important information as this as I do not own a PSP and have no use for this item as I received it.
1,"Laughably bad!!! If you're smart, you won't waste your time.","Wow, this movie is terrible. The plot, dialogue, and main characters are rife with horrible cliches. The special effects are over the top and the action is totally unrealistic - yes, I realize this is a comic book-based movie, but come on. Everyone is invincible until the contrived plot calls for the heroes to defeat the evil doers. None of the characters are likable - particularly Peter Parker, who was so unbearable that I constantly was hoping for his quick and painful demise. There's a dance scene or two which are so intolerable it defies words! This movie is rubbish plain and simple."
1,doesn't live up to the hype,"Spider Man 3 is HORRIBLE! The first two movies were decent, so I was actually wanting to see the third, but it turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. Topher Grace was just awful. Kirsten Dunst's character whines too much and don't even get me started on Toby McGuire. This movie is a huge letdown for the Spider Man trilogy."
2,Spider Man 3 Review,"The up side: The action/fights are pretty good. The speical effects got better. The moral is solid. The Sandman(The other villian) is a pretty good villian and has reason for been bad so you can feel sorry for him. The down side: We only got to see Venom FOR ONLY 10 MINUTES. Emo Peter is even geekier then the other one. The crowning down side of this film is Peter's dance scene. It breaks the movie,it changes everything & it sucks out amount of seriousness they were going much like The Spinning the Earth backwards scene from Superman. Overall,Its not great but pretty good and over-the-top silly. Watch it at your own risk. I give this film a 4 out of 10."
1,Movie ruined by Maguire & Dunst,"Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst ruined this movie. Tobey is too wimpy & emo and Kirsten is not pretty or sexy. Everything else about the movie was pretty good, but Tobey & Kirsten really messed it up. I really hope they hire new actors for the next Spiderman movie because I don't want to see Tobey & Kirsten anymore. I think I have a right to say this about this movie and it's not fair that the editors deleted two of my previous reviews of this movie. Not everyone is going to be a big fan of Tobey & Kirsten, so you really should allow all views to be put on Amazon.com. Because otherwise, people won't trust the reviews on Amazon.com. You can't censor me just because you don't care for my opinion!!!"
2,Walked out of the theatre,"Despite the fact that I own hundreds of spidey comics, really enjoyed the first two movies and nearly staked out the theatre for weeks before its openning night. I found spiderman 3 to be crappy, predictable, and a blackeye to the spiderman franchise.To date, I've yet to see the full ending of this movie, since having walked out of the theatre. To the best of my knowledge, mary janes still stuck in that taxi cab above NYC."
2,Poor features,Much has been said about the movie. I am dissappointed that there is no origin of Venom and Sandman feature. The features boast much about the special effects work of the movie. Unfortunately the movie suffers from great effects but poor execution and story line.
1,horrible,"This movie is definitely not for guys. It's a sappy story with pretty boys for women looking for an adventure story and for little boys that will get more mileage out of playing with the action heros. The foes were an incohesive mix, though the sandman effects were quite good. I was able to stay out of the theaters for the Summer of Parts3's (2007), but the DVD rental didn't seem as bad."
1,"If you are a fan, you already know","Just sweep it under the rug with Superman:the Quest for Peace and Batman and Robin. It will fall short of every expectation and make you wonder WTF happened to Stan Lee's creation. If you love this character, the you already know what they did here. If you are a casual fan, you will just think you wasted some money and almost fell asleep. Let this series die for a decade or so and then rebuild it the way the let the Clooney batman go and revived the franchise with Bale. Sorry Toby....go make Pleasentville part II Even More Pleasent!!!"
5,Three thumbs up,"Spider-Man is here for a third time and the cinematic trilogy is in the books. Comparing Spider-Man 3 to the previous two films, this is not as good as the first but better than the second. Letting this third film stand alone, it is fantastic. It can't be rated the same standing in the first movie's shadow.Peter Parker is threatened by more than one enemy (the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin), while juggling his love life and dealing with a strange black substance changing his ways and temptations. Seeing Parker make the transition from city hero to rebellious icon is a great change of pace for this series. It's different and even humorous (see: numerous dance scenes).At times, Spider-Man 3 can be somewhat corny, but the action, drama, and humor most certainly make up for it. Expect to be entertained!"
1,Pain and Misery,"This movie is so cheesy it makes you want to crawl out of your skin. After what seemed like twice as long as the movie actually was, I was left wondering why spider man had to dance and sing his way into pain and misery for the audience."
3,Decent,"Well, the product seemed used but in good condition. i bought new and came in wrap that looked like it was done at home."
5,Great gift for my son,I bought this for my teen-aged son for his birthday. He loves the spiderman series and really wanted to own them. It was a great addition to his collection and a nice birthday gift. the item arrived in good time and was in the condition promised.
4,Pretty good movie!,This movie series held up pretty well and was close to the comic book storys. Part three had its moments where it looked like it would stall but being a big spider man fan I still like it.
5,Exactly What Spiderman Should Be,"I'll open by saying I love this movie.I'll continue by adding that I don't understand why some complain about ""too many villains"" when that alone captures the very essence of your friendly neighborhood spider-man - he's just a busy guy!All the aspects of the story were powerful and compelling, and I didn't lose interest for one single moment. I loved every minute of ""Spider-man 3"" and I'm glad that the finished production turned out the way it did.The Blu-ray presentation of ""Spider-man 3"" is fantastic, both visually and acoustically.It's easily a favorite!"
1,What happened?!,"I just wrote a review of the new Spider-Man movie (The Amazing Spider-Man), and felt compelled to write a review of this one as well. Afterall, this movie left such a sour taste in my mouth that I was SO happy that they rebooted the series. Now, I know that some peoople will complain about me giving this movie one star, but it is literally one of the worst movies ever made! If it is any indication, this movie is worse than Ang Lee's Hulk movie (and that movie was a giant steamy pile!)! I don't understand how Marvel can have such a good series going and then cock it up on this one. Not only that, but Venom is the coolest Spider-Man villain of all and they made him look like a giant pansy here! Anyway, give The Amazing Spider-Man movie a try. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely not Dark Knight status, but it is MUCH better than this!"
1,Awful waste of time,"This movie is a disjointed, thrown together, mess. It doesn't make any sense. The Sandman guy...what is that about? Who is he? Why is he in this movie? Why not throw in 10-12 more villians and give them each minimal story line? Tobie M. is about as milktoast as you can get, and just painfully feminine. This movie is worse than the Silver Surfer. Why did I watch these two awful comic book movies? Am I losing my mind? It's a sad commentary when a movie you are supposed to sit through for mindless entertainment....doesn't entertain!!!"
3,DISAPPOINTING,"THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT AND THE ACTORS CERTAINLY DID THEIR JOB, BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD A POOR SCRIPT TO WORK WITH. IT HAD SO MANY ANGLES THAT IN PLACES IT WAS CONFUSING BUT MOSTLY IT DRAGGED,AND WAS TOO LONG. THE PLOT WAS DEFINATELY LACKING BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE STORY, THE ACTION WAS GOOD."
2,Missable,"What's good: that black gloppy stuff. Some good CGI there, and up to usual standards in the web-slinging and -swinging.What's not: pretty much everythinng else. Dialog like ""I like being bad,"" professional and amorous jealousies that an eight-grader would find puerile, and a positively painful attempt by Mr. Parker to act as the black glop recommends.I like comic book movies, some of them, and I liked the earlier Spiderman movies. I just don't like this.//wiredweird"
3,The sad facts,"The sad facts: 1 too many villains, 2 Tobey Maguire's dark side was comical, 3 what happened to the magic from the second film? 4 The ending sucked so hard the devil wept, 5 came real close to Batman and robin"
2,Loved the first 2 ... the third is a dissapointment,Loved the first 2 ... the third is a dissapointment
2,Very well-executed sequel,"I thought this movie was easily the best of the trilogy. All you pathetic comic book geeks who were disappointed in it ought to get a hobby instead of bitching endlessly on why Venom isn't ""developed"" enough or why there were too many villains in the same movie. It's JUST A MOVIE, and a great one at that.The action is great, the special effects are amazing, and the overall pace of the movie made every minute of it very enjoyable. Every cast memeber did a great job with their role, maybe with the exception of Topher Grace as Eddie Brock. IF this film had any weaknesses, Topher Grace was it.But if that's the worst problem of the film, then I'd say it's still the best film of the year.Instead of complaining about why the film didn't satisfy their pathetic lives, all those comic book geeks should have stayed home (in their parent's basement) and acted out their version of an acceptable Spiderman flick with their mint-condition action figures!!"
2,Not the best Spider Man movie.,"This movie really disappointed me. Venom was the best part of the entire movie. Peter Parker's little dance scene in the bar was rediculous- half the people in the theater got up and went to the bathroom and the other half were thowing pop corn at the screen. It was not good. My boyfriend likes it just because he's a die hard spidey fan (which is why I gave it two stars and not one)- but if he weren't, there'd be NO WAY anyone could convince me to spend money on it."
2,Really Dissapointing,"Spiderman movies are supposed to be fun, action, adventure and just general coolness with Spiderman himself. This one was just full of whiney crying sookiness from the main characters. And the singing and dancing?! Oh please, this isnt a broadway musical! When I watch Spidey movies, I want to see SPIDERMAN webslinging and taking out the villians...with his mask ON! He seemed to have it off more then on in this one. Why would i want to see Peter Parkers nerdy wimpy face in a Spiderman costume instead of his mask? And what was James Francos character? A villian, The Hobgoblin or The Green Goblin mach 2? Does anyone really know? And again, no mask! Boring. The two villians were the best thing about this movie, particularly Venom, for the all too short amount of screen time he actually got. Overall this was dissapointing, I really enjoyed the first two but Sam dropped the ball with this one."
4,Best of all of them,This is a great movie to pop some popcorn and enjoy with the whole family. There is some graphic content so parents beware.
2,Not comic fan friendly,"Very disappointed with venom, ruined the whole movie for me. He was a very water down version compared to the comics. It seems like they spent all their money casting the movie hoping it would bring a bigger audience. The story was pretty week too, and I had high hopes when this came out. Over all after the movie was over I felt like I had just watched them slam spider man against a pinball machine and.. well you know."
2,"Major disappointment after the excellent ""Spider-Man 2""","""Spider-Man 3"" is a big disappointment after the heights reached by ""Spider-Man 2"".The villains are uninspired, the plot is just a random collection of ideas that doesn't add up to much, the relationship issues between Mary Jane and Peter Parker have become tiresome.The film looks like it has undergone some major post-production cutting (witness Mary Jane's unexplained breakup with Peter Parker) but it is all to no avail.The creators seem to have run out of compelling ideas. Maybe it's time to put spidey to bed."
1,Can we just forget this ever happened,"Spider-Man 3 is absolutely awful! Slaughtered characters and slaughtered the whole spider-man story.The parts are acted fine and the effects are good (of course) but if you are interested in a plot, or you are a fan of the comics, or if you don't have A.D.D. just pass this one by."
3,"Too Many Characters, Too Little Fun","While the third film in the Spider-Man trilogy has some great moments, it has some painful ones as well. I'm not sure what is more ridiculous; James Franco riding a hovering snowboard with bad makeup, the length of the film, which overstayed it's welcome by at least a half hour, or emo Peter Parker dancing down the street. I will say however, that most of the effects involving the Sandman are pretty great, and some of the action sequences are fun to watch. All in all, there are way too many characters, and the film seems like it was just thrown together."
3,BIGGGG Disappointment,"Spiderman 3 was a let down. I enjoyed spiderman 1 and 2, but 3 had too many characters and not enough action. they should have just stuck with just the green goblin or maybe venom. The end was sappy and I hated the way he acted when he was the dark spiderman. in the comics he was more aggressive, but now they make him seem like some kind of love machine. Very sickening. The jazz scene was also dorky and could have been left out!!!! Not a good movie to buy unless completing a collection."
3,Spider-Man 3,"Part 3?-WTF Happen? What Happen? Why the Dance Sequence, why Did they mess up the role of Venom/Eddie Brock? Why So Long? It could have been something Better. It could have been a Contender! Lets Hope Spiderman 4 is better. No wonder they gave this movie away when you purchased the PS3! Spiderman 2 Was Better, as Was 1."
2,mehh...,"The 3rd go around is not so good. There were to many villians and not enough time for character development of them all. Plus, what is with making him emo just because he is venom?"
4,"Better the Second Time, But Not That Good","Although I was horribly disappointed in the movie the first time around, watching it on DVD the second and third time around wasn't as bad as I remembered. The movie had its flaws, but they were redeemable by the better parts. Mostly.The special features were pretty pathetic. I was truly hoping on some deleted scenes, but got left with some trailers, some pictures of the production designs, and a goof reel. There were some others, but hardly worth mentioning.If you are looking for a fun movie to watch, go for it. If you are hoping for something with a little more plot, check out the original movie."
3,Spidey 3 a keeper?,"Although I enjoyed this movie on the basis of pure entertainment with little expectation of other intellectually redeeming values, the scene in which Peter upstages Mary Jane in the bar was stunning to me for its raw vengefulness. Otherwise, the acting in general was so-so, about on a par with the previous iterations and about what I expect in the superhero/comic book genre."
2,"Batman, Aquaman, and Superman review Spidey3","Length:: 5:53 MinsThis is a SKETCH COMEDY MOVIE REVIEW. I improv comedy while giving an honest review of the film. Also, this is a review of the film NOT the DVD (so I don't cover the extras and so forth). Please enjoy!Please check my other reviews!"
1,The Last of Spiderman,"Of all the Marvel characters that have appeared on DVD, including the first 2 Spiderman movies, thia is by far the worst. Marvel comics used to be written for the more intelligent readers and most of the movies have held to this audience. Spiderman 3 is made for the mindless viewers. The story line is almost non-existent and the acting is not even worthy of the old ""B"" movies. This was a waste of money both on my part and on the producers part"
2,The worst top grossing movie ever,I am a huge Spiderman fan or I wouldnt have given it 2 stars. I really liked the first two films. This movie does not live up to the hype. It could have been better if it didnt have Sandman.Two many charcters and not enough story.I was excited about venom being in the movie.Its a let down.When Venom finally makes his short lived apperance you barley see him. He is always got his mask pulled back and you got Topher Grace(Scary!)It really takes you away from the movie. When spiderman and venom are fighting both have their mask off.I waited in excitment to see spidy and venom fight and got Tobey vs Topher.
1,"why, oh why?","Spiderman had to me at least, till part 3 been the reigning champ of superhero movies, till part 3...Then Sam Raimi decides to go the way of Joel Schumaker and pile in 3 villains into the same story line, making this movie unbearable, and to add to the insult, that whole Peter Parker does the ghostbusters walk down NY streets, OMG!Finally we see Venom on screen and he's there a total of what? maybe 15 minutes??!! The one villain I know tons of people were expecting to see and this is what we get, such a letdown. I only hope that if there is a part 4, Raimi gets his head back into the game and gives just one well developed villain, like he had in the past."
2,Bleh...,"I thought the first two Spider-Man movies were decent, nothing I would own, but decent. But this one? Bleh. Didn't really like it. The only high points are the action parts (and even those aren't entirely ""high""). They completely butchered Venom (one of the villains, for those who may not be familiar with the Spider-Man comics these movies are based on), and making Peter/Spidey ""emo"" was just stupid. This just isn't that good of a movie, and it's an even worse Spider-Man movie... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,I'M A BIG SPIDERMAN FAN BUT....,"I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THE 3RD MOVIE. IT WAS JUST ALOT OF TALKING, AND I KNOW ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A STORY BUT, IT JUST DIDN'T MEET MY EXPECTATIONS. SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT, WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEN VENOM, AND I THINK WE DIDN'T SEE ENOUGH OF HIM. IT WASNT TO BAD, BUT JUST REALLY DISSAPOINTED BEEN A BIG SPIDERMAN FAN."
4,Much Better than #2,"Not sure I wanted to see this, after #2 was so focused on violence and little more, but had to give Marvel Comics - and this movie - a chance. And it offers a good turn around, a much more positive theme, even a good one about finding the good in all of us.Note to Marvel: you don't always have to kill the good people off, though. You seem to do that too much when many could come back in other episodes and work `with' spidey in other roles. Don't fear they'll steal scenes, but instead, grasp the potential for a more well-rounded theme of friendship and personal growth. It doesn't all have to be Peter Parker vs violence. Remember: these are comics!"
3,Can't clean it,"Works well, thogh some issues with tracking, but you can't clean the white palm rest. So my mouse now is a dingy off white. Bah humbug....."
1,It doesn't work well,"I bought this mouse for my laptop, most of the time that I'm using this mouse pointer is staying at the end of the page and I cannot move it, so I have to disconnect mouse and again connect it to fix the problem. The other issue is that it has been made of low quality plastic."
1,Great at first...but it's not,"Doesn't work properly, pointer sticks only after a month of use. Battery life is pretty bad too and worst of all, I had to pay shipping to send it back to Kensington for a refund. Do not recommend."
1,Shoddy Design,"I thought the ability to pull out an encased cord to plug into USB was a great idea for when your batteries were down. That is, until I tried to stuff the cord back into the mouse and it not only was nearly impossible to the shell casing back together, but damaged the sensitive left click pad in the process. Cheaply made garbage"
4,great mouse but has one flaw,"I think this mouse is great. I have had it for about 3 years now, no problems. The only complaint I have is the material that the white part is made of. the silver part is plastic but the white part is rubber-like and it gets dirty and you can't really clean it. So now it's dirty looking and I wish the white part would have been plastic too but I love the shape of it, it's more flat than a lot of other products and the scroll is great and I've never had a problem."
4,Great Concept,"This mouse packs away small but has big features. The most unique feature of this wireless mouse is its ability to function as a wired mouse after batteries fail and there are no spares. I have used that capability a handful of times when I've happened to have used all my spare rechargeables on hand.I give the mouse less than 5 stars because one of the magnets that hold the upper and lower shells together came loose. No problem, I'll just glue the loose magnet in permanently. Too bad I forget to double check the polarity orientation of the magnet. The mouse still holds together and functions OK, but it's less than perfect with the back end of the mouse 'floating' from the magnetic repulsion. My fault for a repair job gone bad, but that magnet should not have fallen out to begin with !I have checked around and have not found another wireless mouse with emergency wired operation capability. I may order a replacement of this same mouse before they become unavailable..."
5,Works great,"Easy to use, feels good in your palm, sensitive to the touch. Have used it now for hundreds of hours and works like new."
5,Maravilloso Mouse !!!,"Es un gran producto, detalles para resaltar:- Excelente, estilizado y elegante diseño.- Sumamente liviano.- Conveniente conexión alternativa por cable en caso de agotarse la batería (el cable viene enrollado dentro del mouse).- Práctico ahorrador de batería (el mouse se apaga al detectar inactividad, se enciende con un simple click)- Fácil de abrir (la tapa viene segura mediante imanes)- Cómodo diseño, la mano se adapta fácilmente.- Es reconocido por XP sin ningún problema o demoras.- Indicador lumínico del estado de las baterías (en la rueda del mouse).Es un producto excelente, lo recomiendo !!!"
3,"Nice Form, Not So Nice Function","Pros: Sleek appearance, compact size, easily stored receiver extends battery lifeCons: right and left buttons harder to actuate than a standard corded desktop mouse. Less than a year after purchasing, the right button switch failed."
5,One Great Mouse,"I bought this as a replacement for Logitech wireless travel mouse which was very small. This time around I didn't want to get the super small ones because it was just too uncomfortable to use especially during long use.With the Kensington, it's flat and wide but surprisely comfortable to use and hold. At first I had doubts because I figure it had to contour to your hand in order to be comfortable. But that's not the case with this mouse.The best part about this mouse is that it has the cord as the backup if your battery runs out. Everything you need include the cord and receive is all hiden inside the mouse. Purely engenius! I can't tell how many times my batteries ran out at the most critical time and search for batteries.Kinsington mice are very high in quality. I have an older desktop mouse and it is one of the most comfortable and long lasting mouse of all. I have used Logitech, Microsoft, and other brands and Kinsington is the best.I highly recommend this mouse."
2,"Hardware OK, driver doesn't work","The mouse and RF receiver work well as a ""standard"" 2 button mouse. The Kensington MouseWorks 6.2 software will not function on my W2K-SP4 system. Because of that, the scroll wheel button can not be programmed to perform any function. Even the driver for my corded 3-button mouse will not recognize the scroll wheel button on the Ci75. So I cannot perform a double-click with the middle button, which is a major pain, and I will probably toss this mouse in the garbage.Kensington tech support claims this is a 2 button mouse, even though the web site says its a 3 button. It actually has a side click button on the wheel, making it a 4 button mouse. But Kensington does not offer a driver for this model, so those extra buttons are non functional.The receiver sensitivity is good, 5 feet or more. The buttons are a bit mushy and ambiguous, sometimes missing a click or a scroll, but not too often."
2,Works great at first,"I bought this mouse as a Christmas present for my mom. It is a great looking mouse and the back-up USB feature is great. It worked great at first but after about 9 months of use the outer rubber (the black covering around the entire mouse) covering and the rubber covering around the scroll wheel began to melt off, so we ended up just having to tear the whole outer covering off, leaving an orange plastic cover.I'm going to purchase another mouse, but I won't buy another one with a flimsy outer covering. It works well at first but don't expect it to last in the long run."
1,Major flaws,"This mouse looks nice, but that's about it...Here are the (major) issues:1. The upper side of the case comes off too easily.2. The lower and upper parts of the mouse are held together by 3 little magnets glued to the plastic case with some superglue. Anyone with a bit of brain can realize that you cannot stick metal to plastic with superglue. The magnets *will* come out of the plastic case shortly after purchase, sticking to each-other and preventing the plastic case from closing properly.3. Once this happens, the 3 primary buttons (left, middle, right) become very difficult to use, requiring about twice the pressure to ""click"".4. The tracking is terrible. The arrow's path on the screen is fairly ""gritty"" and lacks the finesse that I have seen in other mice (Microsoft, Logitech, Dell, HP, etc).Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Save your money - no IQ test here.,"No IQ test here. Half the pages are light bulbs with a ""mind"" quote from a famous person. There are a few standard brain teasers that you'll probably have seen before (with the answers right under the question, so it's difficult not to cheat!). You won't find your IQ, although now I'm feeling mine's rather low to have been duped into buying this, even at the price. You get what you pay for!"
4,Hot!,"This is a diverse collection of perverse stories. Some of them turned me on so much that several days after finishing the book, I still can't get them out of my head. I want them to be real, and happening to me, though I wonder if I could handle it. Anyway. A few weren't quite my style, a little bit to sci-fi, but overall a terrific book."
2,It's okay for the amateur,"The product is what it is...not to great on quality, but it does what it does. The lenses are poorly designed and don't give a true image for what they were designed for. Basically it's all generic stuff bundled together and works as a starter for someone just getting into digital photography. If you're a seasoned veteran, getting a new camera..SLR or something, have been using a digital camera for a little while and are familiar with quality, printing and etc...don't buy it. I have several cameras and figured...it popped up on Amazon when I was buying my S3 so why the hell not. Horrible-horrible. I own a S3IS Canon (nice camera but damn slow on recharging the flash), Canon Rebel XT and a Canon G3o!"
3,good,"You get what you pay for, the wide angle works great, but for me, the tele lens needs an improvement in the lens quality because pictures at full zoom are blurred and it is almost the same to take a picture without it and magnify it thru software. I haven't used the macro lens."
1,Conversion Lens Adapter Doesn't match,"No good products, poor quality, wide angle adapter make distortion in corners, Lens Adapter doesn't match with my Canon Powershot S2IS. Tele lens not make focus in tele position. the worst product I can Buy. never again in this store."
3,Powershot Accessory Kit Review,"Be sure you need all this stuff. It seemed like a good deal but when I got it I realized I really don't need the telephoto lens and I already had a better camera bag. Really, I should have just gotten the wide angle lens and saved some money but the vendor was great. One of the pieces didn't fit and they send me a new one straightaway for free."
2,I fell for this one.,"So I thought I'd save a couple bucks. ""How bad could it be?"" I thought to myself. I should have though about it more. Avid photographers would pay hundreds of $$$ for this stuff, and I'm only paying a fraction of that. It was a perfect set up for failure. I had hoped to use these materials for a trip to Alaska. However, the fish eye lens and zoom lens clarity were so horrible that the pictures I took with them were unusable. The handle on the bag ripped after two weeks. The other lenses lack of clarity made them of no use. The small tripod does not hold up my camera. I'm pretty sure the only purpose of this set is so the sellers have a talisman to transport their astral bodies to your closet. I do still use the cleaning stuff and the big tripod, though."
2,Ok product,The wide angel lens distortion is serious and still acceptable.Telephoto lens is useless because it has color distortion.The filters are alright..
3,Not much practical use,"This comes exactly as described and on time, so I have no complaints there.However, I have found not much practical use for it. Maybe I am not a good enough photographer but I dont see much difference in my pictures with or without the lenses."
5,A must-have for Scouts,"I bought this book for each of my Cub Scouts and found that even 9-year olds can use it to identify the trees around them. There are step-by-step paths to identifying the tree by its leaves, bark, pinecones, etc. It is also very complete."
4,Great but not Perfect,"It's a good little cookbook of spells and potions for Dark Witches, but I wish the auther put titles on all her spells and potions to make it easy for the reader to tell apart."
3,no exhange and refund policy,"They send me the wrong item and they do not think the first thing to do is to refund or exchange it for me. I have to try and try.Please make sure what you order is really what you want, there will be not exchange nor refund label in the package."
5,Excellent!! Brings back the fondest memories,One of the best big bands from Puerto Rico during the 40's and 50's. This music never dies.
5,Pres. Bush should have read this book!,"In a time of deep division between North and South as well as division within both political parties, President Lincoln's success in holding the country together is most attributable to his humility and ability to appeal to man's better nature. It gave a minority president a landslide victory for his second term.Though a skillful and shrewd politician he put country ahead of politics. Sadly the current administration has put politics and worse, ideology, ahead of country. We are more divided as a country than ever. Winning the 2004 election required the appeal to man's baser nature and fears.There is a used copy of LINCOLN ON LEADERSHIP available on Amazon.com that is signed by the author and given to Pres. Bush. It is too bad that the president did not read and heed this book!"
4,Lincoln's leadership principles solid today,"Lincoln on Leadership is an very entertaining book dealing with historical experiences of our 16th President, and the fundamentals of leadership Lincoln used to navigate during our nations most trying time. Phillips does an excellent job defining what leadership is, citing several classic leadership books. Phillips explains how Lincoln used story telling and jokes to persuade people. Phillips persuades the reader to his principles of leadership using Lincoln's story. However, Philips does occasionally make broad opinionated comments about the history behind Lincoln. Regardless, a must read for those interested in how to better lead an organization."
2,A Bust - too basic,I study leadership and read this book for a graduate paper I was writing. I found little original thought and excessive citations of the same couple sources. I was unimpressed and I believe the ratings for this one may be artificially inflated. The only way I could see value in this one is if you have little or no prior exposure to Abraham Lincoln.
2,Excessively Basic,"I was highly disappointed with this book after reading the other reviews on Amazon. I found this author to cite the same works over and over again illustrating a lack of extensive research. In fact, he frequently just quoted other authors rather than synthesize any lessons of his own. I found this book to lack nuance or complexity that should go hand in hand with a work on Lincoln."
5,You'll feel better about your OWN abilities,"Lincoln only gets better and more impressive the more we know about him.Bear in mind that the author extrapolated much of the book from Lincoln's writings, speeches as well as 2nd and third person biographical references, but this shouldn't diminish the underlying themes.You'll find that you already practice many of Lincoln's techniques. Half way through the book you'll probably find yourself saying -- I'm doing many of these things already!For fans of Lincoln, this book adds to his already impressive resumé. For those that are management-challenged, this book will give you cause for hope. For management whizzes, the book will be valuable for subordinates. You can't lose."
4,It's leadership not just management,Lincoln on Leadership is a good book to help you look at things from a different perspective. If you're a manager and you really want to bring your team to the next level then you need to change your style to one of a leader. This book is a good one to get you heading in the right direction!
4,To the point,"This book was not really about Lincoln, it was about his leadership qualities. A must read for the insecure bosses in the world."
5,Lessons on Leadership,This is a great book for individuals entering the business world to read how leadership and ethics can and should lead to excellent decision-making skills.
4,Lincoln on Leadership - A Clear Vision for All Times,This is an excellent book. Not only are the lessons outlined clearly and supported by solid examples. You learn much about what Lincoln had to deal with in his life and the multitude of challenges he faced once in the office of President of the United States.The book is a quick read with chunks that can easily be digested. Mr. Phillips provides a nice format for both learning and understanding. This is a must read if you want to learn valuable lessons and tactics for leading or if you are just a fan of this great President.
3,I Can't Think of Anything Witty Right Now,"I bought this for my husband. He and his bandmates like it. They play stoner rock music (Think Monster Magnet, Black Sabbath, etc) so this pedal works for them for SOME songs.Pros:Small footprintFun, quacky auto-wah soundsGood build qualityCons:Somewhat limited rangeNot very touch-sensitiveMany settings sound similarOverall, it's a one-track pony of a pedal, but if you like that trick, you'll love this pedal."
4,Classic Performances,"Recorded between 1946 and 1955, the sound quality on these recordings leaves something to be desired, and, but for that, this would be a five-star CD. However, the performances are excellent, and the historical significance of these recordings by violinist Louis Kaufman makes this CD worth exploring."
3,Cute!,This toys makes very cute sounds and the tote is perfect for our little one to carry the toys from place to place.
5,Too Cute for Words,I bought this for my 9 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She will crawl across the room to get to it. What makes this better than the normal Amazing Animals is that the large bear actually makes sounds when its head is moved back and forth. Absolutely adorable. I highly recommend.
3,"Excellent, but not astounding examples","This is a good album, but its just a teaser of what quality of music these two bands are capable of. Tides Rush In is easily the best track on this split. Powerful stuff by Cursive, as always, but you should get a different album to get their full effect."
1,BREAD CRUMBS CRUMBLES,"Once in a while, a decent backwoods psycho movie comes along. BREAD CRUMBS is NOT that movie.Filled with stock unlikeable characters performed by bad actors, horrible writing, editing and direction (not by THE Mike Nichols), this movie plods along without any coherence or rationality.The ""kids"" look like they're in their twenties and the porn stars look like they could never be porn stars, even though one babe has melonous boobs. There's never any explanation as to the history of these killer brats or their fascination with Hansel and Gretel.The make-up effects and gore are quite bad. BREAD CRUMBS is really stale!"
2,Worst Oils Album,"There has to be a weakest Oils album in their long and great career and this one is easily the least memorable. I used to own a cassette of this album but it was eaten by my Sony Walkman. I think it was trying to tell me something. Before other people flame me for this, just know Midnight Oil was and still is my favorite band of all time. I've seen them in Concert in BEFORE they were well known with their Diesel and Dust release. I know every song in the Oil's catalog and I can tell you definitively this is unfortunately the worst. It doesn't even hold a candle to their other EP, Species Deceases. I can't think of another album they put out that is this bland. Can any of the reviewers here honestly name one album they consider worse than this one?"
2,camp chef keg roaster,"works ok, but the chicken dripping caught fire on the bottom and I had a big grease fire. The smoke affected the chicken and caused the taste to be so so. I am not real thrilled about this product."
4,"All Right, Guys!","Having only heard two or three of these...""songs"" in their original incarnation, I can only say: All Right, Guys! Like the MAN himself, Keith Richards once said, ""Rock and Roll may obsess your crotch but it don't really affect your brain!"" He's right, when you have titles like ""Rape Me,"" you are just ASKING for someone to come along and pop your self-righteous balloon. But, hey: Big Daddy: are y'all listening? Cheese and the guys have very well taken up where y'all left off!"
1,Listen to the Samples First!,"This CD is for a very select audience. Buy this CD only if you: 1) know and like all the songs as performed by the original artists, and 2) love lounge music.I am fond of lounge music, but only knew a couple of songs, so I was rather disappointed with the result.Ideally, Mr. Cheese's treatment of these songs should be both humorous because of the genre transference, and most importantly should be entertaining by themselves. Since I was not familiar with most of the songs, the humor usually failed for me. And, frankly, most of the renditions cannot stand on their own merit. ""Creep"" and ""Fight for Your Right"" were good. As for most of the rest, count yourself lucky if you can forget them."
1,Bore-----ring,"Bill Murray is king of the lounge singer parodies. His work on Saturday Night live was the best in this genre. Everything else must be held to his standard. That having been said, I found this CD ""unlistenable."" If this effort is ""Cheese"", the flavor is Limburger."
5,"Very cool, quite funny, not too cheesy","This album is just amazing. The concept of the album is that singer Richard Cheese and his band take a bunch of well known alternative rock songs and cover them in the style of a lounge/ swing jazz band. It may sound very cheesy (sorry about the pun), but most of the songs are played straight and the way the songs make a perfect transition to this genre just highlights the quality of the originals. This sort of thing has been done several times before (e.g. Moog Cookbook, Pat Boone's metal covers album) but this is the most successful and entertaining. Obviously those without a sense of humour will hate this but I would recommend any open-minded rock fan to buy this because it's both funny and professionally done."
1,"Buy his other CDs, not this one!","Richard Cheese does *NOT* own the rights or royalties to this album. The record company that produced it (Oglio Records) ripped him off. This CD IS great... but if you believe in supporting artists buy his other albums instead, since if you buy this he won't see a dime. His 'best of' album, Sunny Side of the Moon, has several songs from this album. I highly recommend it."
5,Very funny,"Comical twist on songs that you know well. There is some strong language and four letter words that occured in the original form, you can just understand it more clearly in this version."
3,"Very funny, but Black Velvet Flag was funnier...","Seriously....if you like this, check out Come Recline by Black Velvet Flag. Similar schtick."
3,"Fun, you need to enjoy Cheeses style","It's a lot of fun, but it can get old real quick. If you like Cheese, you can't go wrong."
4,Not just a cheezy cover CD,"What a funny concept. Take a bunch of once over-played popular songs and give them another turn, but with a lounge effect. And not songs that aleardy are softer listening, we are talking Nine Inch Nails, The Offspring, and many others. If you are up to something new I recommend purchasing this CD. If nothing else I would be a great conversation piece."
1,"RICHARD CHEESE SAYS: ""DON'T BUY THIS CD""","I saw Dick's show last night at the El Rey and he was unbelievable! He stated that he's in the middle of a lawsuit with the record label of this cd and we should not buy this one. He's putting out a cd this January with new recordings of all these songs, so he said last night. So BUY THE OTHER THREE!!! TUXICITY is the best! Get down with the sickness everybody!"
1,weak material,"I have purchased other Bulova watch's which were of good quality; although this one does not match up. Other Bulova watch's I have are heavy, solid, and have the luster of quality to it. This watch was thin, extremely light in weight, and not because it was made from a great metal but rather because it is made from cheep material, I was very disappointed in it, I guess Bulova does make inexpensive watches however out of cheep material."
3,Like a collection of mellow music videos,"The emphasis here is a selection of songs in the Hawaiian language, from a pre-existing CD collection. Videos have been set to these songs, mostly showing (hula) dances, but also containing still and moving images of Hawaiian scenery. There are subtitles available in Hawaiian (the actual text of the songs), and English and Japanese (translations) -- useful for understanding the songs. I think I was expecting something more focussed on the dances, and less on the music."
2,lasted only a year,"After one year of light use I have to get a new one. The vinyl on the top became brown gray, looking very bad, probably staining from dust becoming moist. but the reason I need to replace is that the very cheap zipper came apart. considering I only changed tanks maybe twice this year, and operated the zipper less than 50 times to access the tanks valves, that is disappointing. I didn't expect much for $27 but it should really have lasted longer.I will look for a product from another company for a replacement."
4,rv tank cover,Is a good alternitive to the fiberglass although it can be torn easily if not careful. We will have to see what a year in the sun will do to it
4,Nice coffee table book for this season,"I bought this just to reread John Updike's essay ""Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu."" It's in there, along with a number of other shorter pieces and excerpts. The artworks carry the book -- a diverse lot with some surprises. Nicely laid out with quality printing and binding. Not a grand slam, but a solid bases-clearing triple."
4,Very good accessory,"I have owned a DeWalt DW618 router with the fixed base for a couple of years now, and I am huge fan (see my review of the router for more on that). When I started looking for a more powerful plunge router to replace my old 1.75hp Ryobi I decided it made more sense to buy this base and use my existing 2.25 DeWalt router motor as my plunge router. This base is very well machined - the fit and finish are excellent. The plunge mechanism operates very smoothly with just the right amount of resistance. The handles are extremely comfortable, and the dust collection design works well too. Basically I have found no serious shortcomings in this product. My only beef is that it is a pain to find the right parts to hook up my Fein Turbo II vac to the dust collection tube/port. But in fairness to DeWalt that is due more to the odd size of the Fein vac hose than to this router base.Highly Recommended!"
3,Good watch for the price,"I am a carpenter a need a shock proof watch that's also water proof, Ive had a only one watch that lasted more then a year in the last 8 and they don't make that model any moreSo far I like the watch but its a little too early to really know how good it is. The band is a little uncomfortable at first but the sharp edge's at the buckle wear down after a couple of weeks. The light is very dim so you can't really see the face at night."
2,Looks great but doesn't work well.,The watch looks great however the first one leaked as soon as it got wet. We sent it back and received a second. This one does appear to be waterproof but it loses time every day. My husband says it's not worth returning because he likes it and it was cheap. He just keeps resetting it.
4,Cool everyday's watch,I liked very much because it's fits and looks. No problem with the delivery. I went surfing with it and had no issues at all.
5,One awesome watch // replacement for Seiko Black Monster,I am a huge fan of large dive watches and recently had the movement in my Seiko Black Monster watch fail. I wanted an inexpensive watch with some heft behind it - and found this gem. Looked at it at local retailer and decided to save some money and bought it from amazon.com. The watch fits well and looks great. I replaced the short(er) rubber strap with a deployment clasp on a Maratac silicon strap and it looks great. Fit my criteria of looks and weight. I am not familiar with the Freestyle brand and just received the watch so I can't comment on functionality or durability.
2,Bulky and broken,"Bought this to dive.Havent tried the dive part but good looking,sturdy ,comfortable,not oversized,and simple to use.The lighted dial has yet to be tested,it is lightweight.The ""screw down crown ""takes a little practice,but I bought this from Amazon,not concerned with issues that might arise.Sept 15 2012:update,after a year in dresser ""waiting for my trip""I decided to use it for a casual watch.It wouldn't run,so I took it to jeweler to get battery changed.NOW BUYER BEWARE:The jeweler told me that movement was in-op!I never wore the watch,and Freestyle wants 13.50 plus ship to NY to check out.20.00 for a 50.00 watch?I don't think so! I went online and bought a nice Casio( from Amazon).So light you don't even know its on,great time,features.Amazon,ok,Freestyle,not with their policy.Good Luck."
4,VERY NICE,"I thought this watch would be a little flimsy, but its actually good quality. Super easy to use and looks great. My only complaint is the band is a bit stiff. I'm hoping it breaks in."
3,"Great Watch, Small Band","I like the watch, good price for the value.However, the band is quite short.On the first hole there isn't enough band for the band keeper tohold the band......The dial is a little hard to read with the silver markings with allthe white on the side of the dial...."
1,Broke too soon :(,"I purchased this for my boyfriend who didn't get to wear it over a couple of times because the bolt that holds the watch to its band kept falling off. Amazon was helpful when it came to returning it, I will update once I get my refund and see how much I get back."
4,Outstanding!,"This watch arrived as promissed. Looks and feels great, backlight works well. Fashionable and sporty. I will recommend this watch to anyone, no doubt."
2,Nice watch but not durable,"Overall I think the watch looks great. Unfortunately, i have had some problems. First of all I take good care of my watches and this watch prove to be more feeble than its solid appearance leads it to be. I have had the hour hand fix, and the crystal replaced, and the band has a slight rip in it and I have been unsuccessful in finding a replacement. All of these problems from normal everyday use. I might of just gotten a lemon..."
4,New Watch,I wanted a watch that I could go swimming with but be nice enough that I could wear it to work. This watch does that. It looks good and is easy to read. Only complaint is that the wristband seems small. I am down to the last two holes. I would buy this watch again.
1,Very Disappointed!,"I purchased this watch from Watchzone on the internet believing it to be cheaper than at my local dive shop. What I hadn't been told was to allow over 20 for import duty - making it more expensive. The first time I wore the watch whilst pool diving, condensation developed on the inside. After my open water dives today it stopped completely. I've tried to contact the copmpany by phone and e-mail without success. I'll now pay to have it fixed as it'll take an eternity to send back. Avoid this company like the plague"
1,Good watch while it lasted,"This freestyle hammerhead watch worked good for about 2 months, then the inside face started to fog up, and a few days later stopped working altogether. Its to bad because the watch is kinda cool looking, but it should last longer than a few months. I returned it to amazon last week but so far have heard nothing back from them."
4,Freestyle hammerhead dive watch,This watch is great! I got this watch to wear at basic training because it says it's water proof up to 660 ft.! And I wanted a watch that I could wear all day and not worry about it getting messed up from showering and whatnot. I've also swam while wearing this watch many times and it still works perfectly! The only thing I don't like about this watch is that it isn't very attractive...but for basic training it should be fine.
1,problems,Problems! At first i received the watch and i liked it allot! I have warn the watch a little over a year and the crystal has scratched and water got into the inside and now the watch stopped working today. you would think that a watch that is supposed to be water proof for up to 200 meters would work fine for someone who has never dived with it! Its a nice watch just not as nice as i thought it would be. another problem is the date doesn't go backwards so u have to spin it forever to get it to the right spot. NO ONE wants to spin a dial through a whole month of 24 hour days to get back to the right spot. I also think the battery should last more then a year and when you spin the dial the second hand doesn't spin with it so u have to stop it right at the top or it is hard to get the exact time.
4,Good Watch,This is an excellent watch. It fits well and the band is strong. Good price & value! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good sport watch.
4,Thought Provoking - Good Non-Traditional Wedding Readings,"I purchased this book because I was looking for the official version of the Robert Fulghum quote to use in my wedding service. Not only was I able to access the quote, which made for a beautiful reading at our Unitarian ceremony, but the entire book was thought provoking and moving. I read this in advance of our wedding, and re-read some portions on our honeymoon, and it was perfect for this stage in my life when I'm thinking about my lifetime and what I hope to accomplish and experience in and it and in my marriage."
2,Unusual,"I read most of the book and found it to be, for me that is, out of character for Fulghum. He deals with parts of our life that we are familiar with and things that we will be faced with possibly that can be unpleasant. All of his other books that I have read I enjoyed, but this one I could do without."
4,Fulghum is at it again.,"Rituals takes on a more serious tone than Robert Fulghum's previous books. He delves deeper than most of his previous essays on everyday life. Fulghum seeks to enlighten us on why we do the things we do. Since I am contemplating marriage to someone I truly care for his essay on second marriages was very thought-provoking. Although Rituals is not as light-hearted as his ealier works, it is a delight to read. I feel there are new discoveries about myself to make as I read each essay. For anyone who likes self-discovery, Rituals is a must"
5,Vincent Bugliosi needs to read this book!!,Harold Weisberg rips the Conclusions of the Warren Commission in a professional unbiased way using the commissions own files.he presents no theories on who was behind the murder of JFK but focuses on the invesigation itself.an excellent extraordinary book for the novice or experienced researchers interested in the JFK Assassination!!!
3,"Sorry, but I Disagree about the CD","I watched the movie a few months ago on TCM, and really liked it. Very good music, dancing, performances, and a likeable story. However, the CD falls short. It has 25+ tracks. There are really only 6-7 well done and memorable songs on it. Two at the start, maybe somewhere in the middle two more, and 3-4 near the end. That leaves a lot of unappealing tracks to wade through. The (orchestra) cuts just do not translate well to the modern ear. I found several of the songs had a very uneven end. It seemed like a few just got cut by the editor before the music died out. It may also be that some of the sound track needs cleaning.Comment on the movie. Nanette Fabray was terrific. Just a dynamo."
1,Boring...,It's got a complex mystery but no reason in the world why the reader should care. All the main characters are board and boring.
2,jerry-built,lack of character depth and overall setting. tone is that of a dated t.v. sitcom- light-hearted but short on wit. gratuitous title for a humdrum detective mystery. a mix of murder and mirth that doesn't jell.
1,Disappointed,"This product is simply talcum powder. It didn't absorb oil especially well and came with a very cheap and stiff poweder puff/pad which made application difficult. I do not recommend, especially for the price."
4,good electronica from Moonshine,"Moonshine Records has had a history of great underground dance music - whether is be house, garage or electronica - and this cd fits the bill fine. With six versions of the song to choose from, there should be one to fit almost anyone's dance music needs. We have your harder mixes (remixed by Micro, Deepsky and The Coffee Boys) and you have your housier mix as well (done by DJ Dan) and you get your original mix. If you like anything by The Chemical Brothers or The Propellerheads, you should enjoy this one as well."
3,"Dundee: ""That's not a knife"".","So, you ask yourself, why does a Henckels Santoku cost under $10?The answer:1. This knife is SHORT - the whole thing is only about 50% longer than the length of an average adult female hand.2. The blade is flimsy - this is definitely a stamped (as opposed to forged), which means ""cookie cutter"", blade. Hence, although sharp, it is on the unstable side and lacks the balance and control one gets with a forged knife (which is typically thicker on the backside of the blade). I never thought that an 1/8-inch differential would make such a difference, but it does.Nevertheless, it is useful for smaller kitchen tasks, especially if you have small hands. However, I would caution that novice chefs/cooks who have not experienced a forged knife should NOT use this as a beginner's kitchen knife - the lack of stability and control can be dangerous if you don't know what you are doing."
2,error report,"Readers should beware of an error on page 36. The form of a syllogism, and the example, are wrong. ""Every mammal is warm blooded. Every whale is warm blooded. Therefore every whale is a mammal."" If this were correct, then we could argue ""Every cat is an animal. Every dog is an animal. Therefore every cat is a dog."" (Later on, they get the syllogism right, but it sad that students will be taught an incorrect form first."
4,Seldom Heard Gems,"It's not easy to find music by Ernest Gold, but here is a disc with three of his works, of which I had two before. I like his creations and this is a really nice package."
5,Homage to a Princess,"Patrick P. Stafford offers a beautiful tribute in his collection of works, Homage to a Princess. While is can be easily said, all who knew of the brilliance of this woman's days couldn't help but be moved by these works inspired both by her life and her death. Each piece of poetry takes the reader to new areas of appreciation and understanding as to how Diana Spencer should be celebrated, rather than mourned."
1,Some facts please.....,"Opinionated, un-substantiated, bias, boring, shallow, transparent, and definitely not worth bothering to purchase or waste time reading. Don't support tripe like this. I regret my purchase and time investment."
2,Sweet jesus I hate Oreilly,"It was a liturgy of ststing the obvious. bill oreilly works for fox ""news"" he, therefore has to be a liar. The point that the book made that I didn't realize was that he was so crazy."
1,The Title Says it all,"First of all I love Bill O'Reilly, but I like reading books by people who hate him. The authors have no factual information to support them. They are just a punch of loonies. This is sick humor too. How many people, minus Ann Coulter, have hateful books about someone? Its just bad to even write a book like this and it makes the far left look even more immature. Read the book it you want to get mad, otherwise it makes a good fire starter."
1,Don't waste your money,"As the title says, this book is nothing more than someone who hates another person without telling the truth why."
3,"""SJ, IHBO'R"" is what it says it is","Okay, I loved it -- but it was a guilty kind of love. O'Reilly draws the wrath of folks like me for his raving and ranting (and, as the book amply demonstrates, his creation of ""facts"" on the fly), but the book is one long rave and rant (albeit well documented -- no facts on the fly).I suppose for those who like to see O'Reilly get what he dishes out, the book is a complete success. But, in the end, somehow, sinking (almost) to his level to do it isn't completely satisfactory."
1,huh?,"I guess this is a funny book if you like a book fueled by hatred and no facts. I mean, this book isn't funny whatsoever, and fails to get all the facts out there. The 2 authors of this book, who need to get a real job instead of listening to O'Reilly all day and coming up with personal attacks against him, need to at least present FACTS instead of the typical left tactic of throwing out 'Liberal Bombs' without backing them up. But, then again, this book is exactly what I expected from someone on the LEFT."
1,Turn Off the TV,"This is the first book in this genre I have read, hoping to learn something about Fox, O'Reilly, factually based. Here's what I learned: The authors believe Bill O'Reilly is nuts--at least they say it about every second or third page. They apparently believe this because they see most everything O'Reilly says as false, and have been sufficiently infuriated by that to write this book! My personal hypothesis is that O'Reilly behaves the way he does to elicit this kind of response from the left side of the spectrum! The more shouting and screaming, the more left they seem!My personal antidote, turn off the tube. I don't watch O'Reilly, seldom watch Fox, and don't feel a need to write a book!"
1,if i could give a circle i would...this book doesnt deserve a star,"This book is ridiculous. What I want to know is where are the facts in his criticizm? If you want to change an opinon you do it with facts, and a positive view of the opposing side, not lamenting over the ideas and views of a successful politcal person with their own show, who provides facts about the nation and the world. What i cant seem to figure out is why someone would actually publish this. Amazon should have the choice of no stars at all...maybe a circle or something for a book or product that provides no food for thought."
1,EXACTLY part of the stuff wrong with this country and world,"Hmmm, Ann Coulter is just as bad at representing the ""right"" as these dorks are representing the ""left"". I'm a conservative, but there are some liberals that I do like and some that I don't. If you ""hate"" Bill O'Reilly, there is something wrong. If you disagree with him a lot, there is something correct about that. If you drink the ""kool-aid"", you probably really hate yourself more than those you think you hate. Hate and nastiness is the very quality that has put this world in the hell that it is in and these guys are just throwing gas on the hate fire as does Ann Coulter. Bill is out there trying to get facts and put both sides under the microscope. Does he favor the right? Well, he favors conservative and traditional values, but so do a lot of democrats and even liberals. I also promise you that the vast majority of democrats are going to label this stuff as the garbage that it is."
1,"Wow, turns out that liberals ARE just bitter, humorless people","While I admittedly fall slight right in the idealogical world, I also have a sense of humor and enjoy poking fun at people who take themselves too seriously. Thus I read this book. I've never been a fan of Bill O's style, but do respect his ability to bring issues of the day into living room's across America, in a way that at least tries to be moderate and balanced.1. Humorless. But then again, never a big strong point of the left. They TRY to be funny to mask their biterness and hatred of average american joes, but it never works.2. Factless. As factless as the authors claim Bill O. to be.My advice: instead of wasting money and time on this book, try visually analyzing TP after it's concluded its course through your nether region. There you will find much more humor and factual substance."
1,the title says it all,"Those of you who hate O'Reilly will find this book funny. However, Bill has done more good than any news commentator in the USA. You can make fun of him all you want but he is the one getting results. From getting rid of liberal judges to protecting our kids with Jessica's law and holding our elected officials to the fire and fixing the Red Cross post 9/11 and putting the spot light on the ACLU. I can name many others but that will not convince some of you. The fact that he is the target of the liberal left says more about who they are than who O'Reilly is. At the end of the day, the truth will win out all the time. To put ""Jesus"" and ""hate"" in the same title is just another ""satire"" that can be excused by the coolaid drinkers but to the fair minded public, it is insensitive abd childish."
1,Good Grief...,These authors couldn't be more paranoid. It's as if they think Bill O'Reilly was secretly planted by ghost of McCarthy to undermine the very lives of everyone on the planet.
5,Brilliant. A must read.,"'Sweet Jesus I Hate Bill O'Reilly' is a hilarious and scathing indictment of the pathological liar and sociopath who hosts the ""O'Reilly Factor"" entertainment program on Faux News.This book is a clear guide to the many lies, distortions and delusions found in nearly every episode of O'Reilly's show.It's rather unfortunate that the majority of O'Reilly's viewers are unable to read, as the content of this book would be a beneficial eye-opener for them.Perhaps Bill himself can record an audio version. As we all know, the man will say anything for money."
2,Facts on short supply,The truth is; if you looked hard enough I'm sure you could find some facts to bash O'Reilly. Unfortunately this author hasn't looked for a single one. I'm glad I read someone else's copy and didn't have to pay for this rubbish.
1,Another Apologist for the NTSB,"Another journalist who knows nothing about aviation pretending to be an expert on the subject. Some flaws with the book; 1. She bases her book on information from people at the NTSB and not Boeing, despite the fact Boeing are far more experienced at aircraft engineering. 2. She fails to check whether the NTSB provide correct information. 3. She sources other accidents that are not related to TWA 800. The other accidents involved terrorism, lightning and fuels more volatile to Jet A. 4. She fails to mention that shortly before the accident, N93119 was struck by lightning, which triggered all safety guards, including centre wing tank protection, indicating that wiring in the tank was OK.Don't bother with this book."
2,"An eye opener, but misses the mark on root cause.","Negroni provides us with an unsettling look at alleged shortfalls in airline safety, the politics of the business, and the friction between investigative government agencies. Disappointedly, her approach to the issues is a little sensationalistic and avoids some obvious facts which detract from the truly emotional issues. In example, the book ignores the changeover to a less volatile fuel by both the military and commercial airlines which weakens many of the fuel tank as the cause theories. Still, ""Deadly Departure"" does provide some new and interesting assumptions."
3,Good Overall Picture of the Event,"I think the author did a good job in the overall coverage of he accident. I would have liked a bit more in-depth review of the whole government shoot down theory. The reader is provided with a some good information about who was on the flight and the explosion. The book reads fast, but like main disaster books tends to slow down toward the end..."
1,"Plodding, Disjointed...Don't Waste Your Time","Surely there must be better written, researched and edited books on TWA 800 than this one. It's plodding, disjointed and difficult to read. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,Q & A Catholic Catechism Review,A great reference for Catholic Catechists and other Catholics interested in knowing and learning their faith.
4,powerful antiwar rock music,"it's unnerving to listen to this music (and other Midnight Oil's music from the 1980s - especially 10...1, Red Sails In The Sunset) and see how relevant the themes and lyrics are to today's political landscape. These songs could easily be about the world created by George Bush and Johnny Howard. This is great rock music."
4,durable toy.,My kids have now out grown this toy. But during it prime it was used a lot. none of the cardboard dinosaurs broke or ripped.
4,great sewing practice,Good for my son who isn't super interested in any threading exercise. Very durable wood panels and the dinosaur shapes are really nice.
5,The best there is . . . .,"Regardless if you're a lexicologist/linguist by trade, or simply curious about the language, or you need some help with crossword puzzle solving, or you are in classes to learn - this is the finest cross comparison Latin/English dictionary out there. Go for it. Don't worry, I'm kolluj edjamifikatud, sew I no wut eye'm tawken abowt."
4,Different,It is dark and definetly not your typical vampire novel. I was confused a little here and there but overall I understood everything....I think. It's what you would think a vampire would be like if they were real. Not all pretty and sociable. A good read. Will read the next Sonja Blue book. By the way this author was on Charlaine Harris's web page of author she likes. That's why I tried it to begin with.
4,She begins,"Another nice take on the vampire mythos. Unlike others, I do not tire of a well written vampire novel. The pop culture vampire books are the ones that make me cringe (we all know what ones they are). This had violence, gore, intrigue, passion and all the other things that make a vamp book worth reading. I look forward to reading more of Collins' work."
4,Great book for teaching,I teach a publisher class and this is a great book to use as a resource! It is very detailed and explains every aspect of publisher. The only downfall is that it is very text heavy and not many pictures. You will have to do a lot of reading. But I would recommend it for beginners and advance publisher users!
5,Great Textbook,"I am using this book to teach Desktop Publishing at a secondary level. The step-by-step instructions are easy for the students to follow, and the practice exercises on the companion CD are very engaging. This book is not sold by the publisher in the US, so I was very pleased to be able to get it from Amazon. I like this better than any other computer text I have used so far. One warning: the book is a paperback spiral and therefore not very durable, so I would recommend covering or reinforcing it in some way."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,This book was very useful. It gives you a very good overview of Publisher with enough indepth examples to allow you to create a very nice webpage from scratch.I Would purchase any other books I could find from this publisher.
1,Was NOT as advertised,I would not call this speaker wire. Very hard to tell polarity (+ or -) and no outer jacket as advertised. Nothing more then simple lamp cord.
5,A Trip Down Memory Lane,"I really enjoyed this book. While I have no specific insight as to how the author really chose the subjects for inclusion in this book, he certainly appears to have extracted a lively (though dead) group of celebrities from all strata of the movie industry.This book was well-researched and provided lots of juicy tidbits about the lives and deaths of the celebrity dead contained within. Unlike many books which promised but failed to deliver the goods, this book was well worth the purchase price. I consider this a worthy sucessor to the out-of-print Hollywood Album I & II which were compilations of NY Times obituaries. And best of all, you finally do find out exactly what happened to many of your favorite actors and actresses. Can it get much better!"
5,"The lives and deaths of over 1,000 movie personalities","Researched, compiled, and arranged by Paul Donnelley, Fade To Black: A Book Of Movie Obituaries is the newly revised and expanded edition of a practical Cinematic Studies resource and reference, adding 100 new entries to the chronicles of the lives and deaths of over 1,000 movie personalities. Each separate entry efficiently condenses the individual's life into a single column or page of informative text. Big stars as well as crucial supporting characters from the history of film, (including scandals, success, great power, and hidden secrets preserved until after death) pack the pages of this fact-filled and enthusiastically recommended compendium."
4,Pleased,I love these magnetic strips. They look exactly like they do in the picture. I'm hanging a big calendar from two magnetic clips that did not come with the board but they don't stick that great. I have some other small magnets stuck to the strips and they work ok. It's almost like these strips work the best with the small little magnets that come with them.
1,Important information is obscure or simple not included.,"The important information is lost in words, screen prints and file prints. It is hard to determine what is important except by the review questions and the questions sometimes cover material not even mentioned in the text. For example the answer to one question is DDL which is only presented in the glossery. I'm going to have to find another book to prepare for the test."
4,"A Loose, Fun Recording","Airto Moreira and the Gods of Jazz (nice modest name for a group, eh?) is an album of jamming in which Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Mark Egan, Gary Meek, and Hiram Bullock join forces with Airto in various combinations to produce a CD that is a joy to hear. Hancock and Corea really seem to be enjoying themselves, Stanley Clarke contributes some lovely acoustic bass playing on a couple of the cuts, and even the lesser divinities produce some solid contributions. A loose, fun CD with plenty of energy."
1,Cheap,"This watch looks great but is made very cheap. It is all plastic and lose. It is assembled like a toy not something that will withstand the elements of surfing and snorkeling. If you are a pre teen or looking for a rec watch for the beach not worried about it lasting a long time this one will get you by but I was looking for something with a lot of substance....I returned this purchase, got a refund and went out and bought a Timex Ironman."
3,Not as humurous,"Its okay just didn't tickle my funny bone, but love his books, good price for the bookwould recommend to a friend"
5,The Wit and Wisom of Mark Twain,"A hilarious book of qoutes, sayings, and one-liners only Mark Twain could have the genious to create.A qoute from Adam, the first of many: Adam was but human - this explains it all. He did not want the apple for the apple's sake, he wanted it only because it was forbidden. The mistake was in not forbidding the serpent; then he would have eaten the serpent.From Adam, the wit and humor only becomes more hysterical, more riveting, more evident; and we soon discover the true intelligence of Mark Twain. He was not an ordinary man; for no mere ordinary man could have thought, and often dared, to utter such words as Mark Twain, in the era in which he lived.The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain contains some of his most outrageous qoutes, either written within his books, or his journals, and spanning more than four decades. A great read, which you don't have to start at the beginning, and work your way to the end. And a perfect way to escape the drollery of prime time television."
5,Funny and wise,"Mark Twain was one of the funniest human beings that ever visited this planet. He was also a very decent one . He was skeptically wise and had the ability to a sentence or two put the most pretentious of all creatures , the human one, in its place.This is the man who upon the premature publication of an obituary about him, replied "" The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated"".One special reason I have a particular love for his work, is the fact that he of all the great writers, showed the most sympathy and insight into the life and situation of the Jews.He is one of the few writers who it seems to me never has to try to be funny, because he simply is.This collection of some of his most famous quips and remarks is a real treat."
4,The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain - A Book of Quotations,Great book! Bought as a gift for my drama students as a momento for a play we did on his life. Entertaining to read with a group of people - to talk about and discuss!
1,Save up!,"Not only is the book small, somewhere between a pack of smokes and a wallet only thinner, it really doesn't capture the wordsmithing Twain was noted for. Damn shame attempt at revenue generation."
4,"WIT, IS AS A SCYTHE TO FOOLS","SAMUEL CLEMENS WAS A GIFT TO MANKIND.HE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMMON SENSE WAS A RARE COMMODITY;MADE EVEN MORE SO BY THOSE WHO HAD IT, BUT CHOSE TO IGNORE IT.HE DIDNT WIELD HIS WIT LIKE A HAMMMER, MORE AS A SURGEON WOULD A BLADE TO CUT AWAY THE SUPERFLUOUS, AND THE UNNECESSARY TO REACH THE TRULY RIDICULOUS THAT LURKS IN HE HEART OF ALL MEN; THAT SOME CHOSE TO NURTURE AND TREAT AS SOME GRAND ATTRIBUTE.CLEMENS DIDNT BELITTLE, THE LITTLE MINDED, HE ALLOWED THEM TO DO THAT FOR THEMELVES, HE SIMPLY TOOK DETAILED NOTE,THAT OTHERS NOT HAVE TO SUFFER A SIMILAR FATE. AND FOR THAT IM SURE THAT GOD SLEEPS A TAD LIGHTER AT NIGHT. THANX SAM."
2,Shop around...,"If you are looking for a nice leather bound KJV bible, I would caution against this one. It is from Zondervan which is a very reputatable source, and a great feature is the introduction to every book of the bible which greatly increases understanding. However the font size is very small- it gives me a headache to look at. The overall size of the bible is small and convenient but this advantage is offset by the small print. I also think the thumb index is not a desirable feature- books are indexed in groups of 3, so it doesn't help you in finding a book- you end up flipping through anyway. The cover is leather, but looks like vinyl, and the inside covers are vinyl, glued to the leather. Cambridge makes a non-reference bible without introductions to each book, but in a lovely leather cover and large (but not your grandmother's large) print font that is very readable which makes a big difference in my opinion. The leather is nicer, too and the price comparable."
3,AKC320B 300w/s monolight,"I purchased because this unit is usable with direct power or by use of a Turbo battery for ease of location photography. The price of the unit was affordable to have as an extra light source, however, the build quality was somewhat lacking. It is also not possible to use the reflector in conjunction with an umbrella which will cause some light loss. Components appear to be somewhat fragile and could not handle hard use."
4,THAT song.....,"The song featured in the 'movie' at the beginning of Gran Turismo is a Chemical Brothers remix of ""Everything Must Go"" by the Manic Street Preachers, which is the title track from their fourth album of the same name (obviously), which, from memory, was released in 1996. The 'Manics' regularly used the Chemical Brothers to remix their tracks from that period on and included them on the B-sides/extra tracks on their single releases for the next few years or so. God only knows where you can get the version heard on the GT intro (somebody else may have posted it above - I can't remember! :P), but there's the facts for ya, so it may help....."
3,"Not exactly what people expect , but still not too bad.","Although most of the music is able to be driven to , some of the music tracks just distract from the mood Gran Tourismo originally established.Tracks 2, 11, and 14 don't really seem to fit in with the GT soundtrack. There were also some good songs from the game that weren't present in the soundtrack. However, fans of exceptional racing tunes should enjoy tracks 6, 7, and 13. Check this CD out if you'd enjoy a more rebellious feeling to racing your GT."
1,Quite possibly the worst mastered CD ever,"If you like the sound of the game you'll hate the CD. The driving beat of the game is just gone, swallowed up by muddy echoes and hiss. It sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom. I like the songs but production quality is so poor that this CD is probably never coming off the shelf again."
3,Not bad for listening in the car,"If you want an exact dupicate sound track of the game, you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good but the taste of the game is gone. As a matter of fact, I am still trying to look for one song that I kept on hearing on the game but fail to find on the CD. It's still a good CD that you can blast either in your room, working out in gym, or driving."
3,A disappointment after listening to the game music,"There are plenty of good game music, especially the song when you pick cars in arcade mode of the game, however, only a few songs on the CD are decent. Tracks 1,3,14,15,and 16 are ok, the rest is junk."
5,Good solid vacuum.,This our second Hoover wintunnel. It is the best vacuum we have found that holds up to pet hair. Its a solid performer with a strong motor.
2,What happened to Hoover?,"We purchased two of these vacuums after looking at just about every ""medium priced"" vacuum on the market. They both worked great for a few months, then the -on-off switch refused to turn off, so the on-off ""switch"" became the plug. This has been fixed 3 times with both models (paid by warranty, but a real pain) . Then the motor started racing on one of them, and that had to be fixed (still warranty). In the past, we have always purchased Hoover professional models, should have stuck with what worked. This model is also made in Mexico, and is fairly flimsy, with lots of plastic pieces becoming loose. I now understand that there is a recall of certain wind-tunnel vacuum's because of the possibility of fire! To cap it all off, Hoover no longer has a toll-free number for service. Not a happy customer."
2,Disappointing to say the least,I was so excited to get this book and so disappointed after reading it. The stories have great potential but lack any evidence or needed detail. I read paranormal books all of the time and usually enjoy them. This on the other hand isn't good enough to waste $10.The final story was like being slapped in the face after being disappointed. You read this longer more detailed story only to find out that it's fiction. Like a joke or something. I won't be purchasing the second book.
4,A Nice Switch on the Ghost Story,"I purchased this as a gift for my sister, and have since read it myself. The stories ring true and offer a change of pace from the typical ghost stories. Some of them are downright spooky, and it's not easy to spook me!"
3,"Possessed Possessions : Haunted Antiques, Furniture and.....","Though stated as true stories by the author, I can't help but think that it is merely intriguing short story fiction. There is a lack of needed evidence to validate these stories as being truely believeable. I am not a hard-core skeptic, I do have an open mind about the paranormal but when evidence lacks, in said to be true stories it comes rather clear to me that it is the work of an active imagination."
4,great value,"Great watch. Not too big and extremely comfortable. From day one I could barely tell that I was wearing it because it is so light. The shaped wristband helps too.I've worn this everyday for about two years now. The buttons work well and numbers are large and clear. However, the face of my watch became somewhat cloudy after a camping trip. I'm not sure if it is due to bugspray with high DEET concentration, or if the watch just got too close to the hot fire."
2,Timex Watch - Not recommended,Supposed to be water proof - got wet washing the car and you can see water leakage inside the face. Strictly a poser watch - not for active use.
2,NoGo Indiglo,"I ordered a Timex Indiglo watch to replace the one that I had bought in 2004 for my elderly father - he's 97. The prior one stopped working and battery replacement would not get it going. I had the new one shipped directly to him. While the time function of the watch works, the Ingiglo feature did not! No matter what we tried we could not get the dial to light up when we depressed the appropriate button. I was willing to go through the hassle of returning that one and getting another for him but he declined saying he would keep that faulty one. I was very disappointed as this is the fourth Indiglo that we have gotten for him over a 22 year period - all have worked properly except this one.Dan Pantaleo"
1,Stopped working aftter one water dunk,"I had a Timex Ironman for 10 years that always worked great, including with frequent use in a pool. The first time I took this into a pool, it stopped working after about 5 min and I could see water inside. I sent it to Timex for a warranty claim. Will see what happens..."
3,Not for lefties,"I've been wearing Timex chronographs for decades. I'm tough on watches, and bought this model after my older one started to look really beat up. I soon learned that unlike every other Timex I've owned, this one has a strap that is non-reversible. I am left-handed, so I wear my watch on my right hand. If you don't reverse the band, it doesn't fit correctly. All you lefties out there know what I mean. This is a good watch, but if you are a lefty, it's NOT for you."
5,great watch,"I've always been pleased with the Timex iron man watch - this will be my third one. They last me about 7 years or so, but be ready to replace the band in 2-3 years (the only negative I can think of for the watch)."
4,customer service,"call customer service about shoddy ironman watchband replacement. these band are a joke,very easy to break and crack.cust. service cant tell me what size i need to replace. look for serial #.after 2 years ,what serial #nowhere to be found.so send in the old band,we will replace it for 10 buck. 10 minute wait on phone for this crappy info"
4,Fell off,This watch is amazing but to my bewilderment it fell off my wrist. Two weekends ago I was snowboarding and checked my watch at the top and again at the bottom but sadly by the time I got to the bottom It had fallen off somewhere along the way.I have since then purchased another ironman watch though.
3,Just one problem...,"This is the 4th time I have purchased this model or variation of it. The count down timer with auto repeat is great for timing stretches and sets. The reason I have to keep buying a new is no matter how carefully I take it apart to replace the battery, the buttons do not work properly after putting it back together and I could not even get the back off of the last one to try. If not for this issue I would give it 5 stars but I really hate tossing a watch just because the battery died."
5,great purchase,this is a great experience on product's office.This is an especial briefcase with less weight and presentable form.Tnahk you
1,limited,"The DVD is of poor viewing quality, too many visual tricks. This DVD is also very short and while helpful, is too limited and falls short of being a true tutorial."
2,Its ok but lacking,"I bought this book with the hope that it would be an actual ceremonial, its not. This book only contains parts of ceremonies and prayers and then refers to other texts for the complete ceremony. I did like certain parts of this text but all in all it really lacks the information which the title boasts. If you are looking for a true ceremonial then buy The Rites vol. 2 that particular text has most of the complete ceremonies which the ceremonial of bishops begins. The Rites vol 2 also costs half of this one."
3,a bit too small and very limited adjustment range,The unit does what it is supposed to do but with now vertical or horizontal adjustment the ability to make adjustments for optimum viewing is very limited. It is also a very short which makes attaching the single mount bolt for the two pieces difficult. I taped the bolt to one side and then gently screwed on the knob.If I had it to do over I would opt for a more expensive mount that came out a bit further from the wall and had a great range of horizontal adjustment of the viewing angle and the ability to adjust the height of the monitor.A good value for the price but it is worth considering a more expensive VESA mount for a monitor.
5,Perfect Summer Perfume,This is such a beautiful scent. It's flowery but not old lady like. It's a light and airy beautiful scent. It wears well too. I love Dior perfumes but this is one of my favorites.
2,Fake!!,Hey well i bought this for my girl and omg it's broke in one day. It's cute. But i think they skipped on the real hard metal. Actually I think that they just was like hey i'm going to use foal for this one. So now i have two pieces and super glue. wish me luck....
3,cute but...,"when i saw the picture of this i totally feel in love with it,it was so cute.but when i got it i was utterly disappointed it looks like it was made out of foil paper,but it was still cute."
3,in response to super-seventies,"Just a note in response to your assertion of another reviewer's ""public display of ignorance"": the book you cite in your review is by Harold, not Allan Bloom."
2,The medium hides the message,"This production has some possibly interesting features, such as the emphasis on rain - the ""weather gone awry"" of Titania's big speech. The trouble with it is its almost amateurish look and sound: no attempt, most of the time, to simulate night, not even with a blue filter. And the postproduction dubbing of the sound is (a) not entirely careful of lip movement, and (b) acoustically uniform: indoors sounds like indoors, outdoors sounds like indoors, everything sounds as though spoken in a small, slightly resonant room - this quite torpedoes any sense of immediacy, space, or Nature. The medium constantly hampers the transmission of the message."
1,not even what it looks like in the picture,"The guitar looks nothing like it does in the picture, it is extremely poor quality. Two of the strings werent even attatched when I received it and I cant get them reattatched. This was suppose to be a Christmas present for my daughter, looks like I spent $25 for kindling wood. Horrible!"
1,Disappointed,Poorly made product; the guitar immediately goes out of tune. Children do not want to play with it.
1,Not Worth the Money,"This guitar would be for decorative purposes only. It is of very low quality. It was shipped in the original box. It arrived with the box completely destroyed and the guitar inside really beat up. It could not be given as the gift it was intended for.Shipping was very, very fast."
5,works for dovetails,"There are many Japanese-type ""dovetail"" saws on the market. Quite a few are not really good for dovetails. This one is, and the price is reasonable. I found the manufacturer's web site, and they sent me a catelogue. This is not their ideal saw for dovetails. That one has a rigid back that extends all the way to the tip. This model has a rounded tip tht can be used to make a plunge cut. I probably will never use that feature, but I have cut a bunch of dovetails and found no fault with this saw."
5,Razor Suzuki Saw,"This is a great saw. Incredibly thin blade, cuts well. I have been using it to made small hand cut dovetails. I plan to order a spare or a spare blade. This beats tradition trim style saws."
5,Great Shoes - Very Comfortable!,Could never wear thong type shoes until I received a pair of these leather Sanuk Flip-Flops as a gift. They were so comfortable I immediately purchased another pair through Amazon to be sure I had a spare! I also like the clean plain look.
5,Corker,No instructions privided with product. Have to do some one line research. After figuring out the method was very easy to use. Did a though job.
1,Sad,"This album does not know what it wants to be. Many of the songs are lame, and at least 2 are really stupid covers of disco songs. It gets messy, and never stops. Don't waste your money, there are so many other titles out there...try the Soca Gold series."
1,The Worst book ever,"This book has nothing. It's crap. I'm in my 4th year of electrical engineerings and this is the worst book I've read. Actually, I thought no book could be this bad!Just 1 example would have made this book better."
3,The Tom Wolfe segment,I expected something completely different from what was given here. I had many years before read Wolfe's first essays. They were to say the least flammboyantly original wild wild wild. They had brilliance and originality in them even though there was a bit of mean- spiritedness there. The power of mocking satire can be funny but it also can be extremely cruel.This interview presented a much tamer creature. Wolfe had a softness about him I did not expect. And above all the conversation is not scintillating. He may well be one of those people who can only really let go properly when he writes.In any case if I had skipped this I don't feel I would have missed much of anything.
3,A good general career book,"I read this book front to back. I am considering a new career in the IT realm, and thought this might help. It's not a book that tells you ""To become an IT professional do A, B and C..."" what it does is provide general career guidelines that can apply to any job. From resume building to networking, most of it is common sense. I would suggest renaming it just 'A Career builder's toolkit""."
3,Nothing new....,"First things first: I am happy with my job, and not looking for another... But I read the book thoroughly, and I kind of liked it. But it's not the first book in this field I read, and I hardly did find anything new.If someone asked for my advice, I'd say: look in your local library, and read it.But don't spend your precious money on buying it."
3,HELPFUL,"Be sure to also check out Ian Fisher's ""How to Start a Career in Information Tecnology, 2nd edition"" 2007."
3,Needs update.,"Very informative, but not up-to-date. Some maps and site descriptions were not accurate. I enjoyed the personal presentation, but some of the routes we tried to follow were not found or had been closed."
2,"OK, but definatly not Rinaladi's best",I read this book. It was written fairly well but it took to long for anything to happen. I found this book boring. It is definatly not the best historical fiction I have ever read. I don't highly recomend this book.
5,LAFFY TAFFY AGAIN!! THIS BOOK WAS GOOD TOO,"If you guys haven't figured it out Ann Rinaldi is my favorite author. (Check out my reviews for Time Enough for the Drums and the Last Silk Dress) Anyways this book was GOOD, it had some action, some romance, (though not as good as time enough for the drums) it was still good. Its about a girl named, well I can't remember her name, I think it was mary, but I don't like the name Mary so we are going to call her Madelyn. She is staying w/ her cousin Tempe, and Madelyn is like head over heals, wait they didn't have heals then! Head over moccasin for this general, and ya da ya da ya da. JUST READ IT!"
1,BORING,A Ride Into Morning was the most boringest book that I have ever read. I could put it down and never pick it up ever again to do my book report. I started to read it and I feel asleep. I don't recommend this book to anybody unless they enjoy boring books by the bad author Ann Rinaldi.
2,Repeats,"If you have the rest of the Sounds of the Seventies series (1970 - 1979), this CD is a duplication of the songs on the other CDs."
5,A pleasant surprise,"I recently had the opportunity to hear The Clerks' Group in concert at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., in an acoustically superb auditorium. While I enjoy medieval music in infrequent doses, this is a group I could listen to virtually non-stop. They sang several selections from this outstanding CD -- enough to let me know this was a disc I not only wanted but needed for my music library. The Masses are hauntingly beautiful as are the motets, and I especially find them a way to relax after a strenuous day or week producing our 155 year old weekly newspaper. The Clerks' Group and their exquisite sound was a pleasant surprise -- in person and on CD."
4,works pretty well,"I have two cats. One has horrible hairballs; the other never gets them. Naturally, the cat who's prone to hairballs won't take these willingly; the one who doesn't get hairballs seems to like them. Every couple of weeks, when I see the hairball cat in distress, I drop about 4 of these (one at a time, of course) down the back of his throat and hold his mouth shut until he swallows. That seems to do the trick until the next time. These things (which are kind of like waxy oral suppositories) aren't magic, but they work a lot better than the paste stuff."
4,easier than paste,We also have 2 cats and only one has hairball problems. She hates the paste and until I found this it was a fight and possibly get bitten proposition. She eats these like snacks if I break them in half and so far has done a terrific job with hairball problems.
3,Hairball Treat,"I got this because my cats can't go out in the winter. My male cat thinks they are candy, while my female cat turns her nose up to them. Now that I know that, I just use a fork and mush them into their meat-can cat food. I have seen an improvement already and they have taken it about 3 times. My daughter found a different brand that both the cats will eat, but I don't think its any better just easier for me to give them."
3,"Cats Not So Sure, But I Like It","The cats (who won't eat people food...not even salmon or chicken) were not about to eat these as ""treats"". They are kibble born and bred. But...when I crumbled them up in my fingers and sprinkled the bits on their kibbles, most of the treat was consumed and no nasty looks from the cats. They've gotten used to it and I put one on the food every other day or so. No barfed up hairballs to report since - these are domestic shorthairs with one being a little more fuzzy than the other. So I can't say the cats loved it and ate them right up but the product has apparently diminished the hair-in-the-tummy issue enough to stop the barfage."
5,Messages To The Soul,"Beautiful! The music, the voice, the wonderful lyrics draws the attention of the listener and then you Really listen--- and start searching for the CD. The radio stations don't help to point the listener to the name of the album but Amazon does! Many of the lyrics carry profound spiritual insights, especially ""Standing Knee Deep"" which sensitively pictures the times when a person is painfully thirsty for spiritual comfort, not realizing ""the river"" flows all around them. Such beautiful images coupled with Lacy J.Dalton's rich,earthy voice makes me stop to listen whenever I hear it."
2,Heartbreaker,"Man, would it have been nice to have a good DVD of Rush. I was going to buy this, but waited after reading so many negative reviews. My friend purchased it and I watched his. After doing so, I have to agree that the sound and video editing are not professional. It's almost like a group of intermediate level-instead of top level-guys got their hands on this and went crazy. Way too much attention is focused on the crowd, and there are times when they are playing and the focus is on the wrong element (i.e. paying attention to Geddy during a guitar solo).The documentary, however, is well worth watching, but the sound on that is even overmodulated at times.I haven't listened to the CD version. If you want a live RUSH concert on video, I still have to say that A Show of Hands is the one to get. And until I hear the RiR CD, I'd have to say get Different Stages."
2,all crowd noise no music,"First off i must say after all the hype this dvd was a dissapointment.I have 5.1 surround and this concert was made in front of 60,000 crazy people in rio ,half of the concert shows the crowd, I dont want to keep seeing the ""freaking"" crowd, I want to see the band! I mean common way too many camera angle shots, neil peart has the biggest drum set to date but too bad the dvd pays more attention to the crowd and not enough on the band."
2,Terrible Audio,"It amaze me how many fans gave this DVD a 5 star. I have almost more than 35 music DVDs and by far this one is at the bottom of my list due to the audio quality. I try to be very objective and critical when I purchase any DVD, and I want my money's worth. It is a awesome performace, but Rush and the fans got rob by the sound mix. I'm a fan of Rush, but certainly not a fanatic... I leave that to David Koresh."
3,Bit of a letdown...,"I'd been waiting for months for the DVD and CD to arrive, and now that I've seen / listened to both, I'm a bit disappointed. The sound, especially vocals, are really sub-par. Vocals are very weak and the bass seems to overshadow just about everything that the crowd doesn't. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to add it to my collection, but it's just not what I was hoping for, especially having seen them on this tour in person. If you really want a great live recording of Rush, check out ""Different Stages."""
2,Rush In Rio,Rush dvd. The case was all broken inside when I received it. Not sure if the dvd will even play.
4,A must have if you missed the Vapor Trails tour.,Only reason it isn't a 5 is it's not Bluray. But that's nobodys fault as the technology was not set back then like it is now. Made my collection of Rush shows complete.
5,Beware of two versions,"Be aware of which version you buy. I bought the single disc version in a store only to find out weeks later that there was a two-disk version with a documentary and other extras. Very annoying.As for the band's performance, considering this was the last show of their first tour after a long hiatus due to a tragedy in Neil Peart's family, they still played amazingly well. And they just keep getting better."
5,MIND-BLOWING!!!,One of my friends wanted me to see this because he knew I was into Rush. So without hesistation I went home and plopped it into my personal DVD player. From the first number I was blown away. I haven't been to any rock shows in my life. I usually don't like live stuff. This is an exception by far! The crowd that night was pumped! Be forewarned the crowd is very loud! But for me personally I would have had it no other way! It didn't take away from the music. for me it added to it! If you have heard Rush's Different Stages live album you will certainly enjoy this I think!
5,Best New Years Eve Ever!,Few years ago I had no New Years Eve Plans. This DVD was aired on TV. I cracked some beers open and got out the chips and dipOMG enjoyed watching this video by myself! Best New years Eve I ever had (by myself) I'm going to order it !! You wont be disappointed. Great DVD to watch solo or witha group. Very enjoyable and highly recommended!!
2,thank the brazilians for ruining a good show,"this concert film is ruined by the NONSTOP screaming and chanting from the knuckleheads in the audience. you would think they were at a world cup soccer match or something, just shut up already!i like rush, they are a very good live act, thank goodness they just released RUSH30, its far and away a better choice then this one is, it was filmed in Germany, where apparently they have seen live music before."
5,Thank GOD!!,"First of all I must say THANK GOD for this gift, finally a live DVD from the guys, this is the best live concert I ever seen in my life, GREAT SOUND, GREAT PICTURE, fans from RIO excellent, did you hear them singing alone on YYZ!! amazing....for those who have critized this master piece, I'll say BUY A BETTER EQUIPMENT!!!! Thanks GEDDY, ALEX , NEIL for this gift for all your fans around the globe."
5,Rush again shows why they are one of the best.,"I just recently got my dvd, and the quality of it was supurb. The music sounds like they are in studio, and the different camera angles in the video turned out excellent. If you enjoy going to a Rush concert then I highly recommend you get this dvd. Also a documentary was included in with this dvd. So considering the elements they fought and getting the stage in place, its amazing at how well this concert was produced. But as always Rush prevails and pulls off another excellent show. But it was good to see a documentarty on Geddy, Alex, and Neil. Makes you see why they are one of the best rock and roll bands, and it allows you to see them as ordinary people like us. Also they really appreciate their fans, and I can hardly wait for them to come out with a new cd. I hope as fans we always appreciate the sacrifices these guys make for us too."
2,a BIG disappointment.......,"I must concur with the assessment that the sound quality of this concert DVD totally sucks.... What a shame. I too looked forward to an intimate document of this super group....the song list was great, but the terrible sound, quick cuts and constant views of the crowd torpedoed this one. Whoever mixed the sound for this really messed up. The crowd was way too loud and sing alongs do NOTHING for me. To see a concert as it should be done check out The Cure's Trilogy DVD set....BTW the Rush ""R30"" DVD redeems all the shortcomings of this DVD. That's the one to buy!"
5,This is amazing,"Rush in concert is awesome. The intensity, lights, music, and showmanship is top class. I've seen Rush live pretty many times, and they are always this way. The best thing is that they play forever. I've seen groups like Van Halen, AC/DC, and Aerosmith. Those guys really leave you feeling ripped off, and wondering how the hell they made music that bad. Rush isn't like that. The live versions of their songs are arguably better than the album versions. That's the mark of amazing musicians. This DVD has almost all the Rush songs that you could want to hear. The concert is long. It takes a good several hours to watch it all. The audio and video quality is great too. Fans of the band will be pleased with this concert."
3,Why bother!!!!,"I just finished listening to three songs on this dvd and my ears can't take anymore! The guy who did the 5.1 mix for this concert should be shot with a ball of his own ****!Listen to Toto, Moody Blues, Roger Waters and ELO to see and hear what a good mix sounds like. A TOTAL RIP AND A WASTE OF GOOD MONEY. This great band deserved better!"
1,are we all listening to same thing??,"I love Rush but,I must say this DvD is a dissapointment.The filming is fine and im sure the the musicianship is good but, you simply cant hear it! The Audio mix on this DvD Is the worst I have ever heard,all you can hear is the crowd and the sound seems to echo,It is awefull.I waited a long time for something like this and I cant hear it!This is not a knock on rush but rather a knock on the audio people terrible job.It sounds like they placed a mic in the audiance and thats it.Dont waste your money on something that sounds this bad."
2,Hate to be cliché--the 2 stars are for it still being Rush.,"...Awful.I heard that the sound quality was terrible on 5.1 or 6.1 surround, but that it could be tolerable on crappy TV-speakers, but this is a damn lie. It's absolutely terrible, adjusted to any audio option my TV or the DVD itself offers. And it's not even consistent with its own awfulness. It's sporadically more awful in random places.The directing is actually okay, I think--the visual is pretty good. In some spots, it is kinda choppy...But for the most part it's nice.So I really could not honestly recommend this. I hear the CD is actually mastered well. Check on that...don't waste your money.~Nate."
2,Disappointing Rush,"As much as I love this band, I have to say that I was disappointed with the product of both the DVD and the CD. The video is decent, but the audio is poor, even more so when you compare it to the standards usually set by Rush. At times, Geddy's vocals are buried, at other times the guitars sound muted. The liner notes state that the band was using ""borrowed"" equipment, and it definately shows in this performance. Maybe a purchase for even the diehards, but otherwise I'd stay away. It should also be noted that it does not come DTS or anamorphic, even though the box states that it does."
1,HORRIBLE AUDIO,"I PICKED UP THE DVD ON RELEASE DAY WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS, ONLY TO BE COMPLETLY DISSAPOINTED. I HAVE NEVER HEARD A SOUND MIX AS POOR AS THIS PERFORMANCE.ONE WOULD THINK THAT THE GUYS IN THE BAND WHO ARE KNOW PERFECTIONISTS, WOULD HAVE MADE SURE THE AUDIO WAS ACCEPTABLE BEFORE IT'S RELEASE. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,I cry every time I TRY to watch this,"You may find a bigger Rush fan somewhere out there, but you will have to look hard and long. Before Vapor Trails, I couldn't find a negative thing to say about my favorite band RUSH. I don't know what is going on with this band and the sound quality of the products they are pumping out now, but this DVD sucks. Vapor Trails...Great songs, insanely bad audio. Rush in Rio, great viewing experience but don't dare try to turn it up loud. I cry everytime I try to watch this. If you listen to Rush for the emotional journey great music provides... DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."
3,"Good, but...","I agree that the mixing on the vocals is awful. The music is otherwise, great, as I'm a rabid Rush fan.The Boys in Brazil documentary is okay, but it has too much of Alex clowning around for my tastes. Also, the Spinal Tap-esque ""soup"" joke was dumb and overdone. Just show me what it's like to be on tour, don't try to do Spinal Tap."
2,is the mike on?,"altho rush is a great band and has been around for a long time and i do enjoy their music, i sometimes wonder what the heck their sound engineers are hearing? the video portion of this dvd is great,no matter what you use for a camera your gonna get a picture.,as for the audio thats another story. this mix is by far TERRIBLE, the lead vocals are set so far back you cant understand what the song is.the band obviously hasnt heard the mix or im sure they wouldnt have released it.i wont ask for a refund ill just keep it with the other low budget recordings that a record company puts out just to make some dough!"
5,From RUSH's hometown,"Living in Toronto and growing up with RUSH since I was about 13, I've always appreciated this ""home-town garage-band come super-band's"" creativity, imaginitiveness, thought-provoking lyrics and above all - the musicianship. This has got to be THE best concert DVD I own, ranking very closely in front of U2's Elevation concert in Boston and Roger Waters in Portland Oregon. RUSH however, goes on to show what has made them so intensley popular around the world throughout the past 27 years. 65000 screaming fans jumping up and down during Roll The Bones can't be wrong. This concert IS a rush! Non-stop kick-ass music from all vintages, crossing all domains from their own unique version of Metal, new age, ballads, and all the songs you listened to in the park, lighting up a fat one and skipping school (that would be Moving Pitcures for me...) Buy this DVD, if you have neighbours - put on the headphones and CRANK IT. If not, or they're Rush fans too - let it loose."
2,Roger Rabbit,"When the new Who Framed Roger Rabbit DVD came out they offered a discount for anyone that had purchased the first release.Lets hope they do this for Rush in Rio.The video is great give or take the ""effects"" but the audio is a very sad state of affairs. Alex and Geddy are one muddy ball of sound, then the low volume Neil is there just to add a little soil to the mix. You have the audience in the rear channels so you get the feeling of being there. I wasn't and I don't need people yelling in my rear speakers while I am trying to watch the show.Kind of wish they cleaned it up with some overdubbing."
5,An absolute must!,"If you are buying a concert video, you want to get the entire concert experience, and that includes the interaction between performer and audience. If you don't care for that sort of interaction, you might as well stick to the standard album. The Brazilian fans make this a unique concert experience, singing along to several songs and creating a huge energy factor that you can feel in the band's performance. The performance is huge as well, extended and including a few songs that they have not been playing as much of in recent years (By-Tor, La Villa Strangiato, chiefly). I have multiple Rush concert videos, and this is an excellent addition to my library."
5,"Wow, this is great","Of course Rush is always great, but this DVD shows how much they love playing and entertaining.I think the crowd noise adds a lot. I bought this because it was live, and the crowd noise gives the feeling of being there. Plus it shows how much they love Rush."
2,Help me if I'm not optimizing this ...,I liked the movie on disc 2 better than the concert on disc 1.The concert was good but I think I may have a defective DVD - the sound and the video are not in sync (video lags by a fraction of a second - makes it difficult to truly appreciate Peart's finesse). I popped another concert video DVD in and it's in perfect sync so could I have a defective DVD? storminfz2@juno.com
2,Atrocious sound quality!,"I'm a huge Rush fan, having seen them live a dozen times. I saw this tour in Salt Lake City. And frankly, I expect the sound quality on an expensive DVD to be much better than the actual concert. The sound is atrocious on this product. Way too much bass, not enough vocals and absolutely no balance or separation in 5.1 Dolby. Total mush..."
3,Rush Rocks! - the director doesn't get it-,"These guys are the awesome. I was so excited to get this DVD, a little worried about the sound from the reviews earlier though. The sound is fine, and the fellas are still on top of their game. The video, on the other hand is horrible. If it were any other band I wouldn't watch it. There seems to be enough cameras, but the direction was awful, hard to watch at times. I don't think he knew the songs, or had ever directed live music before. I hope this was cut live, because if it was posted the editor was just as bad as the director. There is no heart or soul to the pictures here and I'm terribly disappointed. It goes a bit deeper, too. There are far too many out of focus shots as well. I just don't get it. I've produced live events and cut several live videos before and this one makes me want to cry. I expected something put together as well as a U2 dvd.Don't get me wrong, it's worth buying, but watch something else as you listen to RUSH!"
2,Somebody please fire the editor!!,"I was sadly forced to take a whole three stars from my rating due to the blinding fast edition of this DVD from my beloved band, a fact that makes watching this DVD a disturbing experience for eyes and brain. It's really distracting and annoying! I don't understand it!The second DVD is the gem here, unfortunately.AS for the sound, I thought it is great, no complains about it."
1,Poor DVD Quality,"I love 70's and 80's Rush. Later stuff isn't that great for me. This DVD was really disappointing. The video quality isn't that great. Scan lines are really noticeable and too much video of crowd. I know it's filmed in Rio, it's in the title, but I don't really want to see a bunch of South Americans with their shirts off. Nasty. But the audio is the real downer here. The vocals are flat. There's too much crowd noise, even for live. I'd rather just put the original in and listen to that, so I shut it off and did."
2,The words MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT come to mind!,"Man...what a disappointment this long awaited DVD was! The sound quality SUCKED! At first I thought there was something wrong with the DVD. Pretty bad when you own a great surround sound system and it still sounds terrible. It sounded better just playing it through the TV speaker. I have several of their old VHS tapes and they sound way better than this DVD. They call that a Dolby 5.1 recording. What is up with that??? I am a major RUSH fan and was looking forward to kicking back and jamming with the boys and when I turned it on I couldn't believe it! You can't hear any cymbal crashes or licks from ""The Professor"", you don't hear the guitar and Geddy sounds like he is singing in a can! You know, Rush prides itself on quality workmanship and pleasing their fans...the producers of this one should be ashamed! With the strides we have made over the years in technology it should have ROCKED! MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT...MAJOR...HAVE I MADE MY POINT HERE??!!!"
3,Rush in rio in a fishbowl,"Ok, theres a guy on here with a review that says there are no 20k home theater setups. That 20k worth of audio wont fit in a living room. This is obviously the rantings a person who buys everything at best buy. If you buy high end receivers an speakers at a specialty store, 20 k goes real quick. I spent close to that on my system and i will tell you that this dvd sounds pathetic! It sounds like its coming out of a fishbowl. And no i am not afraid to adjust my eq.If you dont believe me put in Peter Gabriels Secret World dvd and then listen to this one. I dont expect every note to be perfect on a concert dvd. But i waited for what seemed like forever for this dvd. When i put it in my system and played it, i could not believe this thing was produced after 1975. Its hard to beleieve the band would put this thing out.As far as concert dvds go, listen to Gabriel, U2 in boston, even REM roadshow to hear how well these things can be done.3 out 5 stars only because i love rush."
2,Cut them some slack!,There is a perfectly good reason why Geddy's vocals are down in the mix.He can't sing very well anymore!!!!Why do you think they didn't play older material as the years went on?This DVD was exactlly what I expected out of a band that hit their prime 20 odd years ago...
3,coulda been better,"I have to weigh in on the side of those who are disappointed with the sound quality and editing of the DVD. To those who say it's about the performance, I say listen to the CDs of the same show and you can actually hear Geddy singing! It's great to have 22 cameras capturing the performance, but I don't think it was necessary to check in with each of them during the course of each verse. It is great to have a video record of the band's excellent live show, but this one was compromised in post-production."
4,5.1 SOUND MIX PROBLEMS ?,"Rush in Rio sound mix. I'll bet that most of you reviewers of this dvd are listening to it the wrong way (Hea?)Yes, I said the wrong way. What I mean is that you have your HT (Home Theater) system set up WRONG just as I did. After reading countless HT magazines, HT internet reviews and how to get the best performance out of any HT system. I've come to a conclusion for all HT users on how to Properly set up your system. First. you must always keep your center and rear surround speakers set to SMALL, yes SMALL. Second if you are using a sub woofer, you MUST sellect SMALL for ALL speakers in your system, even if you have large front speakers. Second, if you have NO sub in your system you will select LARGE for just your front speakers only. This is the way to go and my system sounds much better and so doe's this Rush in Rio dvd.A Rush fan of 23 years."
3,Did they hire Steve Harris to edit it ??!!,"This DVD is very good. Set list, packaging, the second DVD. Even the sound, which has been subject of much dissapointment, is satisfactory to me.But the edition.... Why did they use this frantic editon, similar to Iron Maiden's ""ROCK IN RIO""? It's annoying, a pain in the head, you soon get tired of following the split second change of angles. Also, the changes are made in absurd moments. When one guy begins his solo, the camera goes other side!Anyway, it's Rush and it's the best you will get, because the product is endorsed by them, of course!"
5,EVERYBODY IS A CRITIC....,I do not have some fancy sound system and the DVD sounded just fine to me. I enjoyed it and if you are a true RUSH fan you will enjoy it too.
5,BUSH MUST BE BURNED BY THE CONCERT DRAGON,"The guy from Brazil is right. This show is a great proof that us, the north americans, can do something better than throwing milion dollars bombs over ten bucks slums and kill hundreds of innocent Iraqis.Kubla Khan decreed the Pleasure Dome - A place that this ""bush-world"" should be!Rush is a good replacement for Bush in the people's mind!"
1,Defective Discs!,I tried returning this title several times for defective tracking.The Prologic soundtrack was lackluster and so was the performance.What a let down!
1,Rock para niños,"Nunca he entendido lo de Rush. Una banda que fuera de los Estados Unidos, no gusta a nadie. La propia portada de este disco es sintomática. Rock para niños con pretensiones de sinfonismo. Es hasta de mal gusto que un grupo como este pueda ponerse a la estela de King Crimson, Yes, Génesis o Pink Floyd."
1,"I am sorry, I have not seen this yet","Hello! I saw the Vapor Trails Tour in Chicago, and the crowd never sat down. Even thourgh I was high up in the Stands, I could not see the band. I am a 25 year fan of Rush, and look forward to all the perfections and flaws I've been reading about. I am so glad that something like this is available and in the Widescreen format. My 84 inch wide screen TV will serve as the perfect tool to watch this show. Just as soon as I finsh this pre-review, I will buy the DVD. Looking forward to a new studio album here, and I'm sure their are plans in the works. If you have never been to a Rush Concert or have never heard Rush before, it's an aquired taste. I loved this music. Can only hope the crowd doesn't detract from the music as it did in Chicago.........Have a great day!"
5,"Hey, i've been there....","I've been on this show from RUSH in Rio...By that time i already loved the RUSH history...Albuns like Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings and Moving Pictures are Heavy rock classics! The selection of the songs are PERFECT...besides 1 or 2 songs, i'll say they choose the BEST from their extense catalogue! There's so many classics like FREEWILL, THE TREES and VILLA STRANGIATO ...WOW!! I love that show, which i think is a GREAT perspective from RUSH's history and may create many new RUSH fans!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
5,Rockin' in Rio,"This DVD package is truly amazing. I see lots of complaints about audio, and this, and that, but please. Giving the working conditions on the day the concert was filmed like starting the stage set up too late in the day, which was still not finished by showtime, no soundcheck, no camera check, no audio check, the show had to go on. In this situation you hope that you get luckyand everything will end up being ok. Sure there are a few things that are low in the mix at times, but all in all this is a wonderful concert. And the boys are giving 150% as you can tell, the crowd is great, the DVD package is very nice, the rockumentary is informative and quite hilarious at times. Poor Neil, get that guy some oxygen! 5 stars baby!!!!!"
2,Overrated,"I am not sure where folks are coming from when they deem this a great video concert. I have seen Rush in concert 5 times and this does not measure up. Not only does it not measure up but there are several DVD's released by Rush that are better than this one such as R30 or Exit Stage Left.The audio quality on this DVD is not very good for a concert released in this day and age. On top of that, I find that the set list leaves alot to be desired although admitedley, I am a fan of the earlier rush days pre-dating Grace Under Pressure. Surely, many will disagree with me but for me, I don't find that this was even worth my money. I do recommed R30 or Exit Stage Left though. None of the DVD's released by Rush exceed the performances that I saw from the band in the late 1970's though.Rock On,DJ Craig"
2,Doesnt do the band justice,"I love Rush, and I saw them live on the Vapor Trails tour and was blown away. Sadly, this DVD doenst represent that experience at all.The mix is awful. Filming at the end of the tour was a mistake, they all looked tired and Geddy sounded bad. Worst of all, it was filmed and edited like a superbowl half time show. Whoever made this movie wasn't a Rush fan. You never get to see the guys actually playing their intruments, which is the essence of this band. Instead, they attempted to make them look like 20yo rock stars which just didnt work.My gold standard concert DVD is Queen live at Wembley. That is a 18 year old performance which makes this Rush DVD look very weak."
5,I just don't understand...,"... why so many of you are having sound quality issues. I too went to the theater presentation, and walked out after 10 minutes due to the lousy audio. At that point, I was worried about the DVD, but when I got home and gave it a listen I was very much releived.The audio is simply great on the DVD. Good mix, great bass, just enough crowd noise to get a feel for the excitement and energy in the air that day.Just a bit of advice, my HT system didn't automatically detect the 5.1 DD soundtrack and defaulted to 2.0. I had to manually select 5.1. After that, it sounded just great.I dunno what to say about this disparity."
5,What a live recording/DVD should be,"I understand some people have a problem with the mix (especially the crowd noise) and if I had been at the controls I might have traded more vocals for a little less drums. However, this is a pretty good representation of the sound at a Rush concert (I've been to several) and unlike some more antiseptic live recordings (including some by this band) it really captures the feel of a live performance. If you want less crowd noise, then buy the studio recordings. In this DVD you feel like you are there in Rio. The individual performances are top-notch and the song selection is great. If you want to see an amazing performance by some of the most skilled rock musicians in a live concert environment, buy this DVD."
5,Must see for those who like the band,"When I threw this DVD in all I could think of was ""live"". So many live DVDs are so overly produced that they fail to have that live feel...luckily this one doesn't. It has the same feel as Ozzys live and loud, they both remind one of a concert not a greatest hits album. I liked this DVD from the beginning to the end. Three people playing great music and covering a stage as large as the one they are playing on is a real tribute to the band. The dragon scene on the big screen and flurry that follows is one of the highlights of the DVD. Also amazing to see is the flow of the audience involved in the show. The drum solo (and I'm not a drummer) is also impressive. Overall I must give this DVD 5 stars because it shows one what an actual Rush concert sounds and feels like. It also shows the talent of the band. Impressive!"
5,Still ROCKS,"My feelings about these Concert and adds.Its that Rush stillRules.The guys-GeddyAlex,Neil-may be old but they stillRocks.I give this DVD a Fu..%$# ""A"""
5,INCREDIBLE SHOW,"This DVD is absolutely incredible. I saw Rush three times on this tour, and the DVD is a perfect translation. The double-disc set captures the band in a raw and energetic way. I was amazed by how true the sound was to the actual concert!! I never expected Rush to release something quite this well done. While some say that the sound quality is too rough, the previous release (""Different Stages"" 3-CD set) has a more polished sound. This DVD footage is more similar to the early guitar-driven days of RUSH.Hopefully Rush will take inspiration from this past tour and continue in the same direction...."
2,"The saddest thing in life is ""UNREALIZED POTENTIAL""","If this concert were recorded in 1979 I would have thought it the best thing since the invention of the solid body electric guitar. However, the year is 2003, and we've grown to expect more from a DVD. The sound quality is bootlegish (is that a word?), and although the video quality is good, the editing is aweful. Rush is a ""musicians"" rock band. Musicians like to see extended shots of their favorite playors perform difficult passages and solos. The cd is better, because the video doesn't distract you from the performance.Overall I would not recommend this DVD."
5,Superior,"Excellent, considering the camara equipment wasn't the best available. The DVD captures the band in their legendary form, and the documentary disc shows the all of the work that goes into a concert, particulary their concerts, while giving the viewer a taste of their personal side.I'm giving it 5 stars because of the material, 4 stars on the quality of the recording."
2,I love Rush but....,"I have ripped the audio tracks from the DVD (both the stereo track and the 6-channel mix) and it is UNLISTENABLE. This is the FIRST time this has ever happened for any concert DVD in my huge collection. Unbelievably bad for any concert DVD (even a bootleg), let alone a band like Rush who has generally put out quality recordings. The person in charge of this mix should never be allowed in a studio again."
4,OK At the Start...EXCELLENT At The End....,"Like mentioned in some of the past reviews...for some reason, the sound board was off keel. That is, there was WAAAAY to much bass until about 3 songs in then things evened out. Over all, a great video (once you get past the crowd yelling ""RUSH...RUSH....RUSH"" for every song)!!"
4,Something For Nothing,"Rarely do you receive ANYTHING for nothing...but the cost of this 2-disc set may leave you thinking you have (BUY THE DVD). A spectacular performance by one of the best and longest lived bands on the planet. I bought the 3 disc CD set first(BUY THE DVD) and was pretty disappointed by the sound. Plugging the DVD into my very modest surround sound and playng in Pro Logic mode blew away the CD(cranking up the sound helps too). Overcoming all of the obstacles (some apparently self-inflicted) to make this DVD shows some serious dedication. If you love Rush, (BUY THE DVD). It captures 'the boys' in front of an awe inspiring crowd, and the tour was incredible (I saw them in Hartford, CT). Ignore the naysayers (BUY THE DVD) and purchase this fine DVD."
5,"""Rush in Rio"" - Double Platinum","The best music DVD of the world.Perfect, 22 cameras, multi-angles and 60,000(So Paulo); 46,000(Rio de Janeiro) and 25,000(Porto Alegre) people.In 01 week after release, ""RinR"" is double platinum.It's number #1 billboard."
2,Sound is trash,"If you are a Rush fan, just stop reading and buy the DVD. It gives you a feeling of being there which is wonderful. But if you care about actually listening to the music, it is about the worst sounding concert DVD I have ever heard. If you put the sound in 2 channel it is marginally better. The sound is better than a bootleg, but that's about all your can say. It's just a big mush.I got two DVD's this holiday season, the other being the Peter Gabriel Growing Up Tour and that is an example of how a DVD concert should sound. The Rush DVD is the opposite end of the spectrum. I won't be listening to it a second time.I would like to give it zero stars because without sound you have nothing, but the video is well done and its still Rush and it gives you the chance to see a full concert, so I have to give it two stars. I'm really trying to warn anybody who would consider awful sound to be a showstopper. Otherwise, go ahead and buy it."
1,"Perfect Picture, Horrible sound.","I Have almost all RUSH albums, but I sold back this DVD. Sound Horrible, Way Too much high frequency, Could not clearly hear the lyrics."
1,Major Disappointment,"Just piling on at this point but the sound truly is awful. Led Zeppelin DVD, with the source recorded some time ago, shows what a good producer can do. Rush should be ashamed to have put this out."
1,Audio Crap,"I think this may be the most disappointing music DVD purchase I've ever made. As a huge Rush (and Neil Peart) fan for years and a dedicated drummer, I have to say the sound quality of this recording is just plain inexcusable. When I first saw this DVD I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it. Now I think it will likely only get a single viewing (with the possible exception of the Neil Peart drum solo). I as I watched this for the first time I couldn't believe that a band so dedicated to musicianship and quality song writing could release such crap. This mix reminds me of going to a local bar where there's no sound engineer and the guitar player is playing a cranked 100W Marshall-and that (and the crowd noise) is the only thing you hear! And, by the way, someone happened to stick a cheap microphone way out in the crowd and record it. If sound quality is at all important to you, save your money. It's just plain bad..."
3,Could have been MUCH better...,"As much of huge RUSH fan that I am, I have to agree with some of the poor comments here. The concert was great given the songs they play, but yes the sound was not good, and the blurry video is tolerable. For RUSH, a technically savy and true musician band, this comes as a disappointing surprise. And YES the crowd was annoying at times and spoiled some great songs..."
3,Rushed in Rio,"Being the avid Rush fan that I am, I couldn't wait to see this tour. Saw the show In Hershey, PA and was blown away! The band was tight and the sound quality was exceptional. Purchased the DVD as soon as it was released. I have an above average surround sound system and was anxious to play the DVD on it. To cut to the chase, alot of volume level adjustments were necessary. First off, there is excessive audience noise that continues past the first few tracks. Second, the vocals and lead guitar were very faint at times. I increased the center channel volume more than ever to hear Geddy. Several times during Alex's guitar solos, I couldn't hear it well enough to appreciate it. The drums and bass however did come through loud and clear. I am really disappointed in the mix quality of this release without a doubt!"
5,RIGHT ON PEETEY C!!!,"NICE REVIEW PEETEY C!! (FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T READ IT, CHECK IT OUT..) THE REAL RUSH FANS ARE IN RIO!!! THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T STANDING THERE IN THE 5TH ROW, ARMS FOLDED, TOO ""COOL"" TO LET THE MUSIC TOUCH THEIR SOUL. SCREW YOU PEOPLE. RUSH IS AMAZING.I'M SICK OF READING ABOUT THESE SOUND TECH KNOW-IT-ALLS COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS DVD. GET REAL FOLKS. THERE'S REALLY NOT ANOTHER BAND OUT THERE WHO CAN TOUCH THESE GUYS MUSICALLY. THEY'VE GAINED THEIR HARDCORE POPULARITY OVER THE YEARS DUE TO THEIR MUSICAL CHOPS, AND IT'S NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT THAN ON THIS DVD.I LIVE IN HAWAII.. WE WEREN'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE VAPOR TRAILS SHOW LAST YEAR, SO ALL OF YOU COMPLAINERS NEED TO REALIZE HOW LUCKY YOU WERE TO EXPERIENCE THIS AMAZING SHOW."
1,"Great band, great concert, awful DVD","I have never written a DVD review before but I just had to on this one. First off, Amazon technical information says the disc is in anamorphic widescreen, wrong! Amazon also says the disc has DTS Surround, wrong! I have been waiting for this disc for almost three months and I can't put in words how disappointed I was with both the audio and video quality. The surround track is almost unlistenable, mushy loud bass and to much crowd noise. I missed a whole guitar solo with all the noise! Just so you know I'm listening on a very high end system, Linn, Lexicon, Runco etc. I have over 400 DVD's and this is in the bottom ten for technical merit and top ten for performance. Buyer beware!"
3,Poor Mix but interesting documentary,"I must agree with alot of the reviews and say that the sound quality of the concert footage is pretty bad. I have been a huge Rush fan since 1975--the only thing that rivals this would be the poor sound quality of Exit...Stage Left. I think they they need to get a copy of the Led Zeppelin DVD to hear what a good concert mix sounds like!Having said that, the documentary portion of 'Rush in Rio' gives a very interesting inside look into the band and their personalities and makes this DVD almost worth the money."
1,Poor quality,"Love Rush, but vocals are almost non-existent. Tremendous disappointment. Don't waste your money on this one. They should rework the audio and then try to sell it."
3,Video Good - Sound Bad,"I have been a Rush fan since the 70's and have been to several of their concerts.Pros:1. The filming of this video was done great. Not too jumpy.2. The crowd is REALLY into it.3. Very wide selection of songs.4. Alex and Neil are on fire! They hit every note every Song.5. It's Rush! One of the most talented 3 man groups ever.Cons:1. Geddy cannot hit those high notes anymore.2. The mixing of the audio sux. I cannot speak for the 5.1 option, but playing it in stero mode on a $15K system is disappointing. I can put inAlice in Chains - MTV Unplugged [Region 2] and tell a WORLD of difference in the quality of the audio.Seeing Rush in their later years is cool, but not having quality audio to go with it ruins the whole experience.-PlanoTech"
4,Almost Great,"The only thing preventing this DVD from rating 5 stars is the unfortunate sound quality of the concert. Otherwise this DVD is first-rate. The setlist is outstanding, and the huge Brazilian crowd's energy puts USA audiences to shame. Especially good are ""YYZ,"" ""The Pass,"" ""Bravado,"" ""Secret Touch,"" and ""By-Tor.""A must-have DVD for any Rush fan. It does a very good job of capturing the essence of a 21st-century Rush live show, as anyone who has attended a Vapor Trails Tour or 30th Anniversary Tour show can attest."
4,DISCONNECT REAR SURROUND SPEAKERS,THIS IS A REAL GOOD CONCERT.THE CROWD NOISE FROM THE REAR SPEAKERS MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE BEATLES AT SHEA STADIUM HOWEVER. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PULL THE PLUG ON THE REAR SPEAKERS.YOU WILL LOOSE ONLY EXCESSIVE CROWD NOISE. YOU WILL GAIN A GREAT PERFORMANCE FROM A GREAT BAND.
5,Awesome,"There are many reasons people become Rush fans. You will find them all on this DVD set. Flawless musicianship, great live energy, onstage charisma, and good solid rocking. When I saw Rush Test for Echo concert, I thought that it was the best concert I've ever seen. This is better. They play for three hours! They can play solos note for note yet keep the sound fresh and exciting. They improvise, they surprise and really know how to put on a show. These guys are one of the best bands in the world, they behave professionally, stay humble and are a class act all the way around. This DVD captures it all. Highly recommended! Thank you Rush! Big thanks to Mr. Peart for toughing it out and giving us the music and touring even though he may not have always felt like it. Thanks! I'm a ghost rider too."
2,Horrible,"This was a very long awaited DVD. Unfortunately it does not produce. The sound is absolutely the worst I have ever heard. In fact, it sounds worse than a bootleg recording. I understand that in the liner notes they say it was recorded using a very primitive sound truck. Well if that's the case, they had plenty of shows to choose from in North America where the electronic equipment would have been much better. Truly disappointing."
1,Rush from Rio Dissapointment,Do not buy from these people. I repeat do not buy from these people.Buyer beware.My copy of Rush in Rio will not play on USA region dvdplayers.I have sent two emails to these people to either exchangeit for a copy that plays on USA region dvd players or I want to return it.There is no phone number that I have found to contact these people.They have not returned my emails.
2,Disappointment!,"The sound on this is horrible! It sounds like they just mikes it from the back row. The combo of distortion and lack of mid causes ear fatique. The picture is poor, too. It looks like they used old betacams (Check out Springsteen's DVD to see what can be done with HD!) and the shots are constantly change with no coherance. I'll still cling to my LD of Exit- Stage left. I am surprised to see a recent concert look and sound as bad as this. Even some of the shots are shakey, as if filmed with a camcorder. Some shots aren't even in focus! I am sure that some of these things won't be noticed if you are watching on a small Kmart TV with junk speakers like bose, hooked up to junk electronics.My equipment- Sony 65""wv600 (calibrated with AVS), outlaw 750 amp (200w per channel), Outlaw 1050 receiver, Infinity 2112 sub (2 12"" servo woofs, 200w), 12 modded LX5 speakers."
3,rush in rio,"I just got the DVD today and watched the first hour. The sound quality sucks, even on my killer system! Geddy sounds like he's singing with a pillow over his face. The picture quality is good though. I've seen these guys in concert 6 times and have always been dissapointed with the sound. They need to fire there sound engineer. Because I'm a die-hard fan I still give it 3 stars."
2,An new low in sound quality,"These recordings CD and DVD sound terrible. Save your money. The positive reviews must be written by record company relatives because these is simply sub par merchandise. It's too bad I can't get my money back for an opened item. I'd take it back if I could but they would only take it back if it's defective, which it is, but apparently everyone elses is too.I've been a rush fan for over 25 years and I feel cheated by this puchase that I made based on the RUSH's reputation.The music companies wonder why sales are down. They blame piracy and the Internet. Maybe if they put out some decent quality product people would buy more. If you don't believe the negative reviewers here, ""preview"" it FIRST so you don't waste any of your hard earned cash on this lousy recording of a truly GREAT band.Maybe if we all team together we can get a class action lawsuit against the music company, and get our money back."
3,A Blu-ray upgrade with lossless audio will save this recording,"Rush In Rio is a fine video capture. But the audio suffers from over compression and a poor mix. The video was supposedly shot in high def, so someone on the Rush organization needs to get to work on remastering the video to Blu-ray, with a proper anamorphic aspect, and rescue the audio from the abomination it is on the Rush In Rio DVD and CD releases. This show deserves better and so do the fans."
5,You are there...finally!,"Some people complain about the sound. I agree it is not the most perfect sample in the whole wide world, and certainly far from what Rush had accustomed us in their previous live video releases. But for once I really feel I am there, not in my living room, but jumping with the crowd and enjoying every second of it.Yes these guys are approaching 50, but really you can't tell by listening and watching them play (unlike a certain Mick and Keith duo...). These guys are top notch, wonderful musicians, and they seem to enjoy themselves even more today than they did in their heydays (which I position as somewhere in the mid-80s). So Neal is a bit serious behind his drum army. Well considering what he's been through, you wouldn't even be there. Remember what Alex and Geddy said about him not appearing before the press? The man is still suffering people, but his drum playing sure isn't.Long live Rush. I worship you guys! From a fan since Permanent Waves."
3,where's anthem,This isn't really much of a review I'd just like to know how to find the Anthem video. Can someone please help me. Thank you.
1,RiR DVD,"TO ALL RUSH FANS OUT THERE:we are perfectionists- most of us are probably aware of the little timing mistakes made by the band since there are so fewthe band's live performances will never be adequate- yes indeed I also must confess that the ~1hour long Exit...Stage Left video on VHS was absolutely horrible (however a must have)RiR is still on my wishlist. And yeah okay the sound may be sucky. OH, WELL, I do not care, many fans most likely have unilateral high freq hearing loss anyway, besides, it doesn't matter what the reviewers say, we will still purchase the DVD."
5,A Wild Night in Rio!,"This concert DVD is raw, wild and in your face. From what I understand about the recording, they had no time to do a sound check before the show, so what they got was unbridled Rush! It was also mixed in such a way as to place you in the middle of the crowd. Listen with headphones, turn it up a bit and you are there! They play a ton of their greatest hits and if you like Rush live, you will LOVE this DVD! The 3-CD set is also available and captures the same sound. A must-have for every Rush-addict!"
3,"Great music, but camera work not very good","If you close your eyes, the music is awesome. But the camera work is awefull. It was very hard to watch this dvd. The cameras keep showing the crowd instead of the bandmembers, switching between camera angles too quickly. Very irritating. They keep missing the good parts of the band during the songs. I love RUSH, but they hired the wrong camera men to make this DVD. DVD disk 2 is much better to watch."
5,The spirit of Rush still shines,"Rush in Rio is a must for the symphonic rock fan. I only heard and saw them live in Rotterdam (the Roll the bones tour).Of course I have all their other (live)albums, but this is one not to be missed, a perfect document!The music quality on this DVD is good and the show in Rio is great. The camera shots are, in my opinion, sometimes from to many different directions. For me it's a suprise that even the vapour trail tracks can compete with the music from the 70&80. The film ""the boys in Brazil"" is a nice extra.I hope that Rush will shine their light on Europe again.Every big Rush fan will miss some material on this DVD.For me, Rush in Rio is one big victory."
3,Doesn't do justice,"There's no arguing that this show is a five star performance, nor that Rush is a five star band. This is merely about the DVD, the presentation of which I think doesn't do the band all the justice it deserves. First the sound; The audience is amazing, all 60,000 of them. I've never seen such a pumped crowd. And you can hear all of them, all the time. Too often it's difficult to discern Geddy's voice or much of Alex's guitar work through that - a lot of the mid's are completely washed out. No problem with the drums or bass!I, also, believe the video editing bounces around way too much and becomes tiresome to watch. The concert I saw was pure, smooth, perfection. Because of the sound and video this isn't that.It is still killer concert footage, an exceptional set, Rush at their finest. What'r ya gonna do?"
5,Riotastic,This concert and behind the scenes look into the guys is very candid. These artists are so down to earth. You will watch it over and over.
3,"5 stars performance, 2 stars sound","The sound is very disappointing, especially in the beginning of the show with all that crowd's screams. You must make an effort to distinguish between the guitar part, the bass part, the vocal and the noise. The explanation come probably from the documentary : The material trucks arrive about 6 hours late to the stadium...so the band,the crew and the recording unit didn't have time to make sound checks...too bad for the fan. A very good show but with a missing piece ! Why the stage a laundrymat ?"
5,How do you say AWESOME in Portuguese,"What an incredible show! The guys rarely look so animated on stage. We can thak those loyal die-hard fans in Rio for that. The guitar and the bass are strong, and easy to follow in the mix. The drums and vocals could be upped just a hair, but that's a small complaint. One major complaint I do have is the thanking of PerfectWerks in the credits. The PerfectWerks organization has done little to embody the true spirit of Rush. Instead, they have successfully divided the entire Rush Internet Community over petty differences."
1,Good Music - Very Lousy Video,"The music on this concert DVD is good, but the video editing is horrible, extremely annoying. The camera jumps on almost every beat of the music to various two second shots of the audience, the stage, the lights, the performers, and just about anything, etc. Who in their right mind watches a concert that way??? Its like disco video. The video should just focus on the performers and the stage and dwell on the musicians. When the video is jumping around every two seconds it completely distracts from the performance. I'd rather just listen to the CD. Its too bad, they really ruined what could have been a good overall concert DVD, because the actual music is good. I'm gonna sell my DVD, I'm that disappointed."
2,Bad Mixing,"I've been waiting for this DVD for almost two months and I couldn't have been more dissapointed. The mix on the Geddy Lee's mic is awful. I've changed settings on the audio menu on both the DVD player and the audio options on the DVD. My advice is do NOT waste your money on this, even if you are a huge RUSH fan like me. The sound engineers have slain one of the greatest bands of our time."
1,WORST SOUNDING DVD OF ALL TIMES,"Oh My God!!! They screwed it up. I was at the PORTO ALEGRE concert a few days earlier and was anxiously waiting for this DVD.They screwed up the mix! It sounds awful, you cannot hear the vocals and the bass is muddy. The cameras have a different quality or calibration which makes the video quality uneven.But that is only a small concern. The big problem lies in the audio. The sound quality of their latest two studio releases was terrible because of the too damn loud mastering approach. Now someone screwed up this DVD (and apparently the CD release too).Plus they didn't include an uncompressed LPCM audio track, just lousy MP3-like Dolby Digital, and not even a DTS track!Someone must call them and tell them. They are probably deaf after so many years of endless touring!!"
1,Basically a Sales Pitch,"This book is simply a sales pitch for this author to sell his law services. It doesn't contain anything of substance and often engages in hyped images of sipping champaign on the beach where your offshore account is contained. Additionally, there is not ample consideration given to the downsides of engaging in the ""touched upon"" strategies. This is a waste of money and may even lead you in the wrong direction."
5,"Not a lot of detailed info here, but.....","....if you know little or nothing about the subject it is a great ""30,000 foot overview"" introduction to the concepts. Use it as a general guide for delving into the deeper (and more expensive) treatments on the subject."
1,Beware,"Sorry but this album is not one you should have in your collection. Guy Mitchell was and is always at his best with the brilliance of Mitch Miller and the Columbia system behind him. These later re-recorded items do not in any way reflect the infectious toe-tapping hits or superb ballads which Guy and Mitch created in the 50's. Please, please spend a little more money and get the originals. Amazon has them and you'll be both better served and satified with the real sounds. Sorry to appear negative, but I grew up with and later came to know the man and it saddens me that newcomers to his music do not get the genuine article. Sure these are part of his work, but Stereo is not everything."
3,Not Bad..........Considering,"If you are a true Guy Williams fan like me, you will probably like this CD. Just be warned that these are not the original recordings. It gives no indication anywhere when these songs were recorded, falsely giving you the impression that they are the originals.I must admit these recordings are not bad at all. Mr Mitchel has not lost much of that wonderful voice. All things considered I enjoyed the CD. The recordings are clean, and some could easily take these for the real thing, they are that good. Worth the price."
3,Simply meh...,"I bought this to replace a very nice, restaurant quality wok that met its untimely end, and I'm not overly thrilled. The wok does not sit flat on it's own...the weight of the handle overpowers the weight of the pan, so when you set it on the stove top to cook, it tilts towards the handle. Not a big deal if it's full of food, but when you're trying to heat the wok, and get the oil in it warm, the oil only heats on one side, because the pan only heats on one side! Also the stupid sticker on the handle was insanely difficult to get off, and even though I've had it for a while now, I can't get all the sticky, greasy residue off of the handle. It works okay, but these small things are more annoying than anything. I miss my high-quality wok!"
1,Good Wok/Poor Seller,"The wok was ordered on August 22, and it arrived Sept 24. The company, M.V.Trading, first sent an incorrect item and by the time they acknowledged their error, it took the company 3 additional weeks to ship the correct item. The wok arrived partially damaged in a torn box with barely any tape to keep the box closed. One of the worst companies I have ever encountered with exceptionally poor customer service practices. Order with caution from this company."
1,"Never got my product, whats up with that!!!!","I am very upset I never received my product!!! What Im I supposed to do?!Wasnt even worth rating, but then I couldnt of posted this."
1,tips only poduct no pliers,"I too thought it was a pair of pliers I was buying. it's only the tips, the pliers have to be bought separately."
1,Misleading advertising: there is no pliers,"Although the picture shows a pliers, you only receive the tips. Grammarians and lawyers may parse the written description to try to determine whether or not it implies the pliers comes with the set. I was misled, and was not offered free shipping on the return.Even after my complaint, Amazon has not changed the display ad. I made it clear to the complaint department that the display should be changed. But it is still popping up with the same misleading picture. I bought another SK retaining ring pliers from Amazon which works very well. The old tips are sitting in my tool drawer waiting for a use. The copper ones might make nice antennae for a robot doll."
1,TIPS ONLY--no pliers included,"Despite the product description, this product **doesn't include any pliers**, it's just the tips. That's why it's so cheap. That's presumably also why the product is called ""SK 7648 16 Piece Retaining Ring Plier Tips Set"". Amazon gave me a full refund and said they'd change the description, but that was a couple weeks ago."
3,"Beware, Italian Cut!","This jersey has Italian Tailoring, meaning it is cut for skinny Italians who have no chest. I ordered it based on chest size and couldn't even get it over my shoulders.I returned it for a different jersey with an American Cut and it fits and feels great!"
2,Upload to iPod,Love the music and his band is top-notch. Disappointed that I could not upload to iTunes....I guess it was just in the wrong format.
3,Good Food - Impossible Index,"This book is full of wonderful recipes and a lot of interesting information about places along the old Route 66. However, buyers need to be warned that they will have to spend hours making notes about how to find the recipes they want to try because it has the worst index in the history of publishing. Ex: the banana cake recipe on page 110 is indexed under ""U"" for U Drop Inn Banana Cake. Black bean soup can be found under ""L"" for La Fonda Black Bean Soup. Buyer beware."
