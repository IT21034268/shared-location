2,Not for 30 amp motor loads,"Don't be fooled like I was - although advertised as 30A-120/277V, this switch is labeled: ""MOTOR LOADS OF 24 FULL LOAD AMPS. MAX. AND 2 H.P. MAX"". Although not indicated, the wire connection appears to be limited to 10 ga.I also purchased a Leviton MS302-DS (listed at 30 Amp 600 Volt, suitable for motor disconnect). It is rated for a 5 H.P. motor at 240V. That switch even looks more like an industrial switch and should be suitable for my application as a disconnect for my 5 H.P. air compressor."
2,Amazon Regular,"My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past. However, our last order was a big disappointment. The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past). Not so. Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs. You'd think I was buying caviar! The treats were promptly packed back up and returned. Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(So, 5 stars for the product itself. 0 stars for Amazon this time."
4,Hot New Blues Musician To Track,"I first saw Chico Banks in 2000 at a Chicago Blues Club. The moment I walked in, I realized I had made a discovery. Here was this guy on stage laying out licks that had mezmerized the audience and me too, as I staggered to quickly find a seat.I go to see him live as often as I can, each time he astounds me anew with smokin', exciting and riveting blues from his masterful guitar playing and soulful artistry. This album is the only way I can recapture a live experience anytime I want."
2,Another wannabe artist...,"A friend gave this CD to me so I gave it a listen. With 1 exception, this is all sub-average imitations of great old blues masters. But even the title song is taken from a famous song. Wow!- Go for the original artists- they are so much better. Someone rated this as ""4 stars? oh, I had to speak up! Too many great artists..Buddy Guy,(many Grammy's, still kickin hard!) Or- Albert King, Mudddy Waters, Hendrix.. the list goes on forever! Let this guy do late nite clubs!"
3,See Chico Live,"For true blues fans, Chico's -not- very bluesy. For chops freaks, his chops aren't even close to the 'real' guys. Kinda stuck in between styles, he gets over well enough with a boozed up crowd, (although I'm pretty sure even the drunks don't really like his singing). To make matters worse, his live show is filled with time wasting- lame attempts at humor, and long, private, (on-stage), discussions with his band-of-the-day on how the next song goes."
2,2 episodes are copies of season 3,"season four claimed to have 4 episodes,well it does actually, BUT, episode 3 and 4 are the same two episodes from the season 3 tape. so if you only buy season 4 your ok, but if you buy season 3 and 4 (like I did) your [paying too much]...."
1,It is just wasting time to watch a useless film like this.,"You will suffer for one and half hour by watching this terrible film. I like teen movies that started from in the late of 70s and the begging of 80s such as Swinging Cheerleaders, Bachelor Party, the Last American virgin, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""; or even films like ""Porky"" and ""Screw Balls"". Today, teenagers still like teen movies like ""There is something about Marry"" and ""American Pie"". However, some teen movies like ""Coming Soon"" (only because they are rated as teen movies) trick the young to waste their time and money."
1,havent gotten what I ordered,"I am not sure why, haven't gotten my stickers, I ordered 01/08 its now 01/15 nothing yet, but the delivery date says 01/14"
3,"Not bad, not great","The only reason I read this book is because I belong to a book club and this was the selection. I voted for something else!I liked the main character, and her best friend, and their activities made for really good reading. However, large parts of the storyline were sometimes tedious to get through. I found myself skipping ahead more than once, and only finishing because I didn't want to miss out during the book club discussion.Maybe I just came from too ""normal"" a home, but I don't understand why so many novels have to center around dysfunctional or non-traditional families.At least most of the adults in the novel had good intentions, and more redeeming qualities than bad ones, and there is a lot to be said for that. And, it was fun to read about the evolution of their family tradition, however weird.I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. It is just OK, but nothing I would rave about and recommend to friends."
2,"Quik Drive WSNTL2LS Wood Screws 2-Inch Lubricated Course Twin Threads, Yellow Zinc Coating",Item arrived as promised but the screws were not properly collated and frequently jammed my Quick Drive Gun. I wasted a lot of time and many screws due to this condition. I have used this Quick Drive Gun for many years and this is the first time I have experienced any problem with the collated screws.
3,Great price - when they finally got here,This was the best price I found anywhere but if I was ordering for a working job instead of stock I would have been out of luck. Ordered 1/20 rcd. 3/13 and the three cases were condensed into 2 priority mail boxes.
5,Awesome,"Thrilling and exciting. Might be scary to little kids a little bit, but other than that it is interesting and keeps readers into the book"
4,Awesome kids series,My 7 year old loves this series. The only reason I didn't give this 5-stars was because it's a bit scarier than the first one. But certainly not enough to steer us away. We have both loved the series!
5,Super #2 for Sisters Grimm,"Another great read. Read in one day, and loved it. Continues right where the other takes of and keeps you on edge of your seat waiting for number 3. Truly a wonderful ADVENTURE RIDE!!!"
1,years on the shelf?,"If you use this brand you know that this color has been discontinued maybe a year ago. Several years before being discontinued the packaging had been changed from a cover with tapered tip to blunt. The product I received must have been years old. It is in the old packaging with the tapered tip, and actually goes on thicker and darker than expected for this color, probably due to its time on the shelf. The picture actually does show the packaging with the tapered tip, but they don't tell you that not only the picture, but also the product is from the archives."
3,2 part lip coverage,"I like the color of this lipstick. It feels good on my lips, but it doesn't survive eating or even lip-licking as promised, so it's a little disappointing."
5,I am so happy!,"I loved this show and watched it every week! I was twentysomething when I watched it and couldn't wait to be thirtysomething myself. Hope and I both had miscarriages at the same time and had babies at the same time. That was kind of weird, but gave me some comfort in seeing how she handled the loss.Now that I am fortysomething, I look forward to rewatching the whole series and cannot wait for the remaining DVD's to come out!"
5,"I'd like to yell, ""BRAVO!!!...""","...but it took too damn long. They'll have to settle for my $$$. :-)Now all we need is Molly Dodd, China Beach, and the remaining unreleased seasons of Anything But Love to represent this era of TV properly."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW!,"Waited for this release for years! This is my favorite show of all times! Excellent writing, directing and acting."
4,Great,This was a great TV series and it's so great that it's on DVD now to enjoy over and over again. I gave the set to my daughter for Christmas and she just loved getting it. It makes a great gift for someone who really enjoyed the series.
1,Disc 6 doesn't work,"The show is great, but buyer beware! I watched 20 episodes, ready for the last one, and the final disc does not work. I have tried several players/computers. Too late to send it back, blah, blah, blah. Guess I'll never know how season one ends."
2,WAAAAAAMBULANCE,"Thirty Something was good for something back in the ""me"" days, but now it is a simplistic view of big babies in their thirties who are close to being devoid of character. They're all about their wants like the children they try to raise and I am glad I am not 'Thirty Something.' It is boring.....................call a waaaaambulance. The manufacturers of the DVD are not at fault for the writing of the show--their product was in perfect form."
3,Long awaited...but sometimes you can't go back.,"I was a ""thirtysomething"" at the time I watched Thirtysomething when it was first broadcast. I was a devoted fan who couldn't stand to miss an episode(even with the ability to video tape and watch later)and saw myself and friends reflected in every episode. However, many long years have passed and I'm now a fiftysomething with different friends,concerns and interests. I put in the first DVD episode and totally lost interest about 15 minutes into it. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood to watch that night, but when this much time has passed before a series is released,whatever relevance this may have had to your life will have completely changed. Better left as a fond memory."
2,No Menu??!!,"Very disappointed! There is NO menu on the dvd. It only says ""Play All Episodes"", period.Can not get to individual episodes---can not access captions/subtitles (not available).Was so looking forward to viewing all this and it is very tough to navigate.Great content, and Shout Factory should be ashamed to rip off people who have no other option if they want to watch a terrific show."
2,Blu Ray?,"A lesson in how to do things only halfway well. One of the best TV series, certainly of the 80's, and once out of the morass of music rights, they don't release it on blu-ray? Epic fail for a show that deserves to look its best. Look up ""Mad Men"" on Amazon, and see that the blu-ray version of season 2 sells for $9 LESS than the standard DVD version. So if the economics are not in the way, why do we have to settle for standard def DVDs? Thirtysomething was shot in 35mm film, and could have easily been mastered in the hi-def format. No wonder blu-ray is still a straggler. Until the studios figure out how to market it, blu-ray will remain a niche, unless it fades away forever."
1,Annoying characters,"I have several shows still on vhs & after watching them this past weekend I remembered how annoying this show was. OMG!...it's almost unwatchable, I wanted to throw something at my tv. The ""Hope"" character is almost comical now. I think the reason they delayed this dvd release so long is they were hoping people had forgotten how bad this show really was, especially towards the end. Save your money.P.S. Michael & Elliot constantly playing games in their office then they wonder why their business failed...LOL!"
5,How am I going to wait until May???,"I am enjoying this show as much, if not more than I did when it was my favorite series of all time back in the late 80's! It is superb in every way, from the writing, directing, fantastic acting by all, and wonderful story lines. No wonder I don't like TV much anymore- shows like this are not to be found!Like another person wrote I tried to space out the episodes, but forget it! I get totally lost in the lives of these complex characters and the hours fly by.Season 1 is wonderful, Season 2 is wonderful and now I'm so engrossed that I have to keep re-watching because I have to way until May for Season 3. Glad I got them in Winter so I have more time to watch.My sister starting telling me about all the other shows she's seen these actors in but I made her stop. I just want them to be Michael, Hope, Elliot, Nancy, Ellyn, Melissa, and Gary forever!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Underwhelming.,"I remembered this show as being quite good, but I'm halfway through season one and wondering if I can go the distance.The acting and writing are overdone. I don't mean that the characters are whiney and have issues, I mean that the characters are inconsistent, over-played, and come across as very artificial, very staged.There are some fun meta moments, such as dreams, animated photos, scenes replayed from different points of view, speaking to camera. There are some moments of genuine insight. There is A LOT of middle-class angst followed by a scene where the characters laugh at or question their middle-class angst, followed by more middle-class angst.I'm not sure if it's worth continuing. If aliens abduct my discs tonight, I won't miss them."
4,D&#65533;j&#65533; vu ¿¿ Excellent!,"The 6th record of Dieter&#65533;&#65533;s Blue System project. I don&#65533;&#65533;t really like the first single of the album, which is &#65533;&#65533;Dj vu&#65533;&#65533; (reached no.12 in Germany) doesn&#65533;&#65533;t really work for me as a single. I loved all the tracks on this album except the songs that were made singles! Which were the first and the second track. I feel &#65533;&#65533;Sexy Thing&#65533;&#65533; should have made a single. The second single was &#65533;&#65533;It&#65533;&#65533;s all Over&#65533;&#65533; which was a duet with Dionne Warwick and that single reached no.60. So to finalise it I would have to say all tracks from 3 &#65533;&#65533; 10 are very good, so all the fans of Dieter&#65533;&#65533;s work should defiantly get this album.FACT: This is a Gold selling album"
3,Great Ideas--No How-To's,"Full of wonderful ideas but they give sparse directions on how-to's or they say ""available comercially"". You just have to guess the rest? I love the ideas but instructions and product resources are sorely lacking."
2,Not good quality,Service was fast. Got delivered quick. But the book came not wrapped in anything. It was in a big box with other items I ordered so it must have been scratched up in the shipping process? Hopefully this isn't how the seller shipped it. The cover was all scratched and bent. Not happy with the quality. Hopefully content of book will be better....
3,Any new storage ideas?,I was hoping that this would have some new ways for storage in ways that were practical for my home.
2,OK but not their own ideas,"I did see quite a few of the pictures before, in other books. So all in all this book is OK, but not very original."
5,All good : No Filler,"Everyone talks about Parklife and refers to the singles cut from it like Girls and Boys, Parklife and End of a Century. But the one thing that makes this album great and on a par with the later 'self titled' blur album is the strength in depth. Some of my favourite songs of all time are the ""filler"" tracks from this album such as Tracy Jacks, Bank Holiday, London Loves and Magic America. Their dabbles with experimentation also become clear with The Debt Collector and Parklife, and both in my opinion are highly succesful. This is the album which cemented blur as my favourite band and it also contains one of my favourite songs; Trouble in the Message Center."
5,The Beatles Who?,"Despite the fact that the song ""Girls & Boys"" would make my top ten list of ""Gayest Songs Ever"", ""Parklife"" is a brilliant album. It established ""Blur"" as a band that is not only capable of creating catchy songs, but is also a band that is made up of musicians that are actually talented. The songs on ""Parklife"" sound as if they were composed, written part by part. When's the last time you heard an ""om-pa-pa"" song (""The Debt Collector"") on a pop album? Unfortunately, the mega-hyped arrival of ""Oasis"" in the U.S. overshadowed this great album."
5,Really wonderful British pop,This is a really lovely album. Really funny and poppy and oh so lippy and sweet. I couldn't stop listening to it.
3,"Good, but how can people say this is the best blur?","I had heard from many people that this was the best of the five albums . . . it's good, but inferior to ""The Great Escape"" and I don't know, I liked ""Modern Life . . ."" better, too. Still worth having, but tracks like ""Jubilee"" really bring the album down . . . starts great, but ends mediocre on some songs. Get it anyway."
3,Seldom seminal,A sometimes fun strain of dancier Brit alternative from the early nineties movement cannot live up to lofty praise.
3,Umm... Huh?,"I guess I don't see the big deal with this album. I'm a Blur fan yes, but I don't find this album satisfying. Some of the songs (London Loves, Magic America) are so ridiculous sounding that it makes the great songs (This Is A Low) hard to take seriously/enjoy. Parklife's predecesor 'The Great Escape' is a better and more satisfying album. I'm glad they've gotten away from this kind of quirkiness in recent days. Hope the new one is good."
2,"It's not Radiohead, but......","There's good songwriting and a lot of talent here, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea. Somehow, it just doesn't work, and isn't a pleasant listening experience for me at all. Radiohead is one of my all time favorites, and this just doesn't compare. I'm not saying everything has to sound like Radiohead (thank heavens it doesn't), but like RH I'll give this album several listens to see if my opinion of it doesn't change. Right now, to my unaccustomed ears, it sounds like Clash meets Duran Duran with some late Beatles thrown in. Maybe a bit too much ""British pride"" for me. If you like that kind of thing, then by all means get this album. I will end by saying it's better than 90% of the music being made today,, having good composition, arrangement, and songwriting."
4,Good,"Like their counterparts, Oasis, Blur has a knack for capturing late 60's Brit-pop and giving it a contemporary sound. However, what separates the two feuding groups is that Blur writes better songs. ""Girls and Boys,"" ""London Loves,"" and the title track are the standouts, but there really isn't a bad moment to be found on this album. Those interested in the British alternative invasion would be best to start with Park Life."
2,huh?,"I bought this album having only heard ""Girls and Boys"", which I think is a great song, and was immediately displeased with the rest on the album. The song appears to me to be ground breaking in its time and very catchy. The rest of the album is basically full of bombs - filler around the first track and its title track, ""Parklife"". Most songs are just a lot of sounds basically that have no substance to form a quality song. The others just aren't as catchy or pleasing as the first and fourth track on the album. For those that like it: well it's not my cup of tea but you are entitled to your opinions. If you really like and want to hear Girls and Boys and Parklife, just download them somewhere or buy the single... don't waste your money on the album."
1,I hope my review brings down the average...,"I had heard Song #2 and was drawn to this brit band that I thought would be like Radiohead. These guys don't come anywhere near Radiohead, I am taking this CD back as soon as I can. It's a total waste of time."
4,This Girl's got it!,"Once I heard Dannii's most recent album, ""Neon Nights"" and immediately became a fan of hers, I started buying her other albums, knowing I wouln't be disappointed. Well I was right. ""Girl"" is a terrific album with catchy tunes, and different ballads. My most favorite song is the famous ""All I wanna do"", which no matter how many times you listen to it, you never get tired of it."
3,"For all the Girls and Boys, this is Raw Dannii","This album has some stomping tracks that were overlooked when it was released. Its not a great album but its not terrible either. Worth a listen though and a suprise turn for someone who could have stuck to the old formula and not take a risk which this album was, as Dannii was dropped when Girl flopped. This edition includes ONE bonus track , not two as it is being advertised. If you want pure pop buy her sisters album Light Years, but if you want some thing a bit different then buy this."
4,excellent,"This is simply a class A rock and roll album. Ginger Baaker formed a band with two guys names Adrian and Paul Gurvitz, who were in a power trio called Gun. Check outGun/Gunsight.Straight ahead enough, but with Baaker's athletic African-influenced drumming, great guitar work and writing and vocals, plus a complete lack of showboating, this is really a straight rock dream formula: not the head and ten minute jam some power trios tended to fall into.Get this. You won't regret it."
1,Not rated for 250 psi as advertised,Found out the hard way that this thing is only rated for 150psi and not rated for 250psi as advertised. It made it to about 170psi when the bowl exploded like a bomb. Also the gauge that came with it didnt read right the needle was jumping up 5psi at a time instead of raising smoothly.
2,Only just satisfied,"Bought this CD for the Danny Boy track. Unfortunately, it was not the film version. Still good, mind, but not great. The rest of the CD is OK, but very short."
4,A Little can still Mean a Lot,"The principal draw of this disc for me is the film's main theme, which as others have pointed out is actually the melody Lament for Limerick. Carter Burwell's arrangement of it, admittedly, is haunting and much of the album is in a sense a set of mild variations on that tune, especially the End Titles. The rest are all too brief musical moments or arrangements of classic or period pieces like the King Porter Stomp or Danny Boy. However, the entire disc consists of only about 30 minutes of music, and a good portion of that is the main theme in one form or another. In that sense, I'm not sure whether investing in this release is necessarily worth it. I own it and enjoy it for the small portion of that half hour that I find so compelling, but I suspect that if I were starting over these days I'd just make a few trips now and then to YouTube to get my necessary dose of that main theme."
2,Imaginations Running (Really) Wild,"No matter what the gender is, everyone acts irrationally in all of Homes' short stories. It is without rhyme or reason these characters exist to do whatever and to say whatnot. Each tale ends abruptly therefore it is up to the readers to compose their minds about each conclusion. Some are funny than others and all of them are quite bizarre. Extreme usage of adjectives and pronouns in narrating events among more than two people at one time can result in a mild confusion in regards to the actual speaker or doer. Nevertheless, it is a fast read of a collection of peculiar people and happenings."
3,"Some good stuff, but not her best.","As is usually the case with Homes, these stories focus on discontented suburbanites. Mostly weaker men, stronger women. Some very good, if tough to read stories. As always, Homes's writing is quick-hitting. Especially as she deals with more serious topics: a husband and wife couple in which the woman's cancer is exposing the weaknesses in their relationship, the story of a man who hits and kills a kid with his car, and a story about Nancy and Ronald Reagan and dealing with his Alzheimer's. Overall, the stories were less outrageous than some of her other stuff, and several of them seemed to end with punch lines, which I didn't care for. But pretty good stuff otherwise."
1,"Yes, things you should know....","Skip this book as it will not save your life!!!But I LOVED the cover, of course...."
4,My pick for bookclub,"I am a big AM Homes fan and was anxiously awaiting this book. If short stories are your bag, then this book is a great read. Her characters are flawed and real and wonderfully odd and i love the way she writes. Most you wish went on longer. While it doesn't have the same sense of a community like The safety of objects, i still recommend it."
1,Book buyer - know this...,"This book consists of 13 instantly forgetable stories. These stories have no plot, theme or otherwise apparent meaning. Buyer beware. Footnote - 3 years later I now see that Amazon has 78 books for sale for as low as $0.24. Ha! Overpriced I say!"
3,Don't you read the track listing?,"Of course that song wouldn't be on it, because this is the SCORE. It says it on the label. If not there, it says it on the track listing. It's a Thomas Newman score. That being said, it's definitly not the best of his works, but it's not bad if you like his stuff. Some early electronic work that's not bad, but it takes a while to listen to it to like it. You may grow tired with it. Don't know where to find that song, though. Good luck finding it."
2,"None of the songs from the movie, just the background music.",Bought the album to hear In Roxy's Eyes which was sung by Melissa Etheridge in the movie. I can't find the song anywhere.
1,Ripoff,"This album is [awful]. There are two great songs by Melissa Etheridge in the movie, including the title song ""In Roxy's Eyes"", and neither song is on the soundtrack. This type of marketing should be illegal. I had to give the record 1 star to enter this review. In the future, Amazon should offer the option of 0 stars for CD's like this."
3,"NICE ,BUT RIPPED","I like the suit,helped build up a good sweat.But the pants ripped after wearing twice.I was very disappointed. I sent for another suit figured i would try it one last time."
2,GP,"sweat a lot not durable, if you use this product be careful, probably best for jogging no weight lifting if I was just a runner I would probably be able to rate this product different, maybe could hold up better than doing fast movements with heavy weights."
5,Pink & Clear Genuine Swarovski Crystal earrings,"I gave these lovely earrings to my daughter this past Christmas, and she loved them. They sparkle beautifully in the light, and their color goes well with many of her clothing choices. I would purchase these earrings again.SCER007 Pink And Clear Genuine Genuine Swarovski Crystals Cluster Sterling Silver Leverback 1"" Dangle Earrings"
5,Beautiful!,I bought these earrings for my Bridesmaids. They are lovely and will be perfect with their dresses!
4,It Made Gable a Star,"For that reason alone, ""A Free Soul"" is worth a gander, but I think you'll find it interesting enough even without that distinction.Norma Shearer is The Free Soul in question, a wealthy young woman who's looking for kicks and gets slaps in the face when she decides to walk on the wild side by dating Clark Gable, an underworld thug. At first she's turned on by the rough treatment she gets from Gable, especially as it disturbs her boring fiancee Leslie Howard. Her dad is something of a Free Soul too; Lionel Barrymore is an attorney who's squandered his abilities at the bottom of a bottle, a sort of black sheep role model for his impressionable daughter. Things go from bad to worse for Norma et al., and there's a murder and a sensational courtroom climax before we're done.Just keep your eye on Gable--you'll see that you didn't need to be a crystal ball to tell that hunk was going to be a big star!"
4,INTRIGUE AND SUSPENSE,"A very nice piece of work by two talented authors and excellent editing by Christine Mrazovitch. I enjoyed the interaction between the FBI informant and protagonist lawyer Sam Cohen, and the romantic interaction between the men and women in the novel. One of the more interesting characters for me was the bartender Mel Pollard, who knows and sees all when the legal experts and power brokers just relax and talk freely. Even more fun is the fact that Mel is a secret mystery writer. I liked that Sam took on the establishment and kinda lost, but is still in there questioning and searching for the complex answers. The story also gave interesting insight into the Black Panther movement whose members never fit into a standard mold - not all were Marxists, gangsters or simply misquided youth. A good book - watch for the follow-ups. I know these writers have many more stories to tell."
5,Griffith reveals his humorous side,Hollow point is a combination of action and humour. The cat and mouse game between Carrera and Griffith added to the enjoyment of the movie. Sutherland was a devious and witty character and Lithgow made an excellent bad guy! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie!
4,80's movies rock!,"A true 80's movie to watch, feel with action and drama. A classic cop story and still trying to get the girl at the same time."
4,Has its share of mishaps but otherwise decend flick,"This movie is good. Not an oscar worthy, but, otherwise good enough film. There are moments where you will think ""Yeah, like only one squad car is going to show up after a huge mafia shoot-out."" Or. ""Why are the mob-bosses running away instead of halting their own henchmen's fire."". But, hey, the acting is good. The overall story is decent, and I love Donald Sutherlands witty sense of humor. All in all a satisfying movie."
3,THE HUMOR HELPS,"HOLLOW POINT is a pretty routine action shoot em up, but it's keen sense of humor and its sharp performances elevate it to a much better than average thriller.Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith play sparring government adversaries out to stop a nefarious money launderer. Their romantic battling is reminiscent of MOONLIGHTING although a little more physical. Carrere uses her stunning beauty quite well and Griffith is very funny as an egotistical morphine popping agent. But the real stars of the film are veterans John Lithgow as the aforesaid villain and Donald Sutherland, just having a grand old time as a morally conscious assassin. Veteran director Sidney J Furie keeps the action moving with a funny climax with our four stars all pointing guns at each other. Not a classic but good entertainment."
4,Good brainless fun,"""Hollow Point"" is an surprisingly successful mix of action and comedy. The story is nothing special but there's plenty of action scenes and manyy funny scenes, and it's also helped by a good cast. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrere make a good team and John Lithgow a good villain, but Donald Sutherland really steals the show as a hitman. This is a perfect movie to turn off your brain and have fun for 100 minutes."
4,Great research but limited applications,"I would like to see new edition of this book that includes how the research can be applied to marketing, etc. Obviously the authors were very diligent, but some of the concepts evolved early in their research and no longer apply. For instance, the prospective demand for estrogen replacement therapy in aging women. Recent studies indicate higher incidences of cancer in women that take certain hormone replacements, thus a shock to the demand for these drugs. Let's get a revision and work with a marketing guru to apply these principles. Also, work with a new editor to make this more readable and less like a textbook. And lower the price and go to paperback, and maybe work with a reputable mainstream publisher like McGraw-Hill."
4,The Spirit Of Churchill,"Given the title and the picture of Churchill on the cover, it's hardly surprising that half the songs reflect the mood of the Second World War, and present a sound picture of a nation united against a common enemy. As to the remainder, not all of them fit the national theme quite so well, and I wish that the net had been cast more widely, so as to bring in a greater range of personalities. Nevertheless, remastering has been well carried out, and this 2-CD set is a real bargain,"
1,It's not very Good,"This was a very promosing album, however it turned out to be quite awful. The main reason for this is the exclusion of the track ""Pet Semetary"" by the world's first punk group, The Ramones. The track was written especially for the film on a request from Stephen King himself. I was overall very dissapointed with this album. The instumentals were tedious and were poorly composed by Elliot Goldenthal. This is unfortunate as most of his other soundtrack work is quite remarkable. I would advise you only to buy this soundtrack if you are truly a hard-core Stephen King fan and you enjoy bad music."
5,We came on down,"This is a really fun book for anyone who loved game shows growing up or has come to love them on the Game Show Network. I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loved it! It gives lots of ""behind the scenes"" info and is an easy ready."
2,Great Film; Terrible DVD Transfer,"I thought I had lucked out when I spotted this for sale on Amazon. But upon viewing my new DVD copy of ""Mister Johnson"", I was thoroughly disappointed. The picture is blurry and it ruins the viewing experience. Only buy this DVD if you are hard-pressed to see the film, like I was."
3,Excellent synth pop nostalgia,"Yet another 80's band gone into oblivion and one you probably won't brag about listening to. But beneath all the funny hairdos, electronic drums, synthesizers and the slick studio sound (Colin Thurston and Duran Duran keyboard player Nick Rhodes produced), this band actually consists of gifted musicians. Especially the bass player Nick Beggs, whose fat'n'funky slap sound can be heard all over 'Ooh To Be Ah', 'Frayo' and the instrumental 'Kajagoogoo'. It's pure kitsch but very listenable, and you'll have to admit that these guys knew how to craft many a hummable tune. Who doesn't remember 'Too Shy', their catchy No.1 breakthrough? Too bad that the fans turned their backs on this band on their subsequent and more mature releases. Definitely still worth a listen."
5,"cause they've been here for years, friends of mine","collecting dust and tears. this album is just new wave tops. there are some songs on here that rank as all time faves, and I was late to discovering kaja. this album, along with islands(extra play on vinyl), and crazy people, all have a level of consistency that, the songs you like on them, you LOVE. don't know where to start with this one. white feathers, magic man, hang on now, ooh to be ahh, this car is fast, all dope. I didn't like frayo at first and now it's amongst the beloved songs on this album."
2,One hit wonder,"This came out when I was in college radio. Unlike commercial stations which were limited to playing whatever the label released as a single, if we got a solid album in, we'd work every track we could. This means that consistent albums like Duran Duran'sRio, Squeeze'sSweets From A Stranger, the debut byA Flock Of Seagulls, the Psychedelic Furs'Forever Now, Bananarama'sDeep Sea Skiving, a couple of theGo-Gos'albums, Toni Basil'sWord Of Mouthwere all good for anywhere from four to seven tracks on our playlist over the course of six months after their release. We had no qualms about giving airtime to what the boring FM rock stations of that day might call ""bubblegum"".The debut by Kajagoogoo had an infectious lead single in ""Too Shy"" but everything else was pretty much just an album cut and we never went deeper than the one track on this one."
3,Respect,"This book's low Christology urges daily concrete salvations that address the oppression of women in the physical world of daily subsistence. In doing so there are multiple crucifixions and salvations that will include women, deviating significantly from the author's Roman Catholic life experience. The author conflates evil with tragedy and suffering. It argues for plurality of discourse without a universal statement that results in exlusivity. It calls for respect for all women."
5,I'll be visiting...,"this soundtrack & the movie again and again.I had first rented the film because I like time travel flicks and I missed it in the theatre. It was fun and had an enjoyable score. The medieval flavour and the surprise dance/disco ""Your Time Will Come"" at the end was the clincher and I had to buy the CD -- my first to go along with the film that I also bought.Recommended."
4,Great CD Storage!,"Got this unit today through Amazon.com, installed it and loaded it up. It just happened to be the right size for my cabinet. It makes storage a breeze, where you can easily get to your music with the pull out track feature. Highly recommend even with the slightly steep price."
4,Delightful and Refreshing for All,"A villain plans to take over the world. Two teens ( a boy and his sister ), a spunky aunt, and several very humorous characters work against him. I viewed this movie twice! The story moved at a good pace and held my attention throughout. The young teens are sweet, smart, and savvy. One minor character who is learning to speak English uses the word damn at the beginning but he quickly gets over that. The three females in the story are the sweet teen, her strict aunt, and the singer, Miss Missy. I also loved the amusing role of the dog. While viewing this DVD, I saw first rate animation. Children watching this film will feel empowered by the action of the teens and all will enjoy the humor. The adults will be entertained as well."
5,Fun movie for children AND adults!,"This movie was enjoyable for my 6 year old and for the adults in our family. Having suffered through watching many kid's films that are agonizing for adults to watch, it was a pleasant surprise to be able to share the enjoyment of this movie with our son. The film is funny, unpredictable, and tells an offbeat tale that hooks you in from the beginning. An added plus is that the animated western scenery is beautiful! I did not find any of the content to be inappropriate for my child."
1,NOT appropriate for children.,"This movie is rated PG, but I would not let young children watch it. Having a character scream ""Dammit"" several times in a row is a sure way to get your kid to repeat it over and over. Truly terrible. Couple that with the liberal references to alcohol, and the poor production value, and there is really nothing left to like about this train wreck."
1,AWFUL! I totally agree with first reviewer.,AWFUL! I totally agree with first reviewer. Thank goodness I only rented it and did not buy it. Waste of money even renting from a redbox for only a $1. Shortly in I stopped it due to the inappropriateness for my two children. Do not buy unless you like to throw away your money and do not care what your children watch.
1,Terrible and inappropriate,"We turned it off after they repeated damn it several times in a row. Besides that it was poor animation. From other reviews I've just read, I'm glad we turned it off!"
1,Horrible!,Absolutely awful! Very misleading. By the cover of the movie you would think this is for children...but what parent wants their children to watch a movie with foul language in it? I was shocked. TVG wouldn't work on the movie so I didn't bother waiting to see if there was anything more offensive. We turned it off and regret that we ever rented it.
1,AWEFUL,"Absolutely AWEFUL. We had to turn it off after 20 minutes. There is cussing, violence (fist fighting), guns, and references to alcohol. If that wasn't bad enough, the movie itself is really bad and the animation is second rate. Absolutely skip this one!!!"
1,Do not buy or let your kids watch this movie!!!,I am shocked that someone would make a movie and able to label it a family movie!!! I could not believe my ears when I heard cussing in the movie. Man it was a waste of money!!!
3,The Intermatic EJ351C has a Problem,"I have used this Intermatic timer/light switch for several years - I currently have 3 in service controlling outside lights. They work well, at least at first. My problem with the unit is that their effective working life is too short and any interruption in the power supply, however brief, will deprogram the unit. The worst of these two problems is that they last less than 2 years. That is, they just stop working for no apparent reason and have to be replaced - they will go off/on on manual, but you can't program them anymore. After 5 replacements, I am going to a digital Honeywell unit - I will tell you how that works out."
1,Poor Quality,This switch is junk it wont last long if it works. Find an alternative I did after 2 intermatics broke imediatly. Intermatic didnt really care when I contacted them.1 star is too high
2,intermatic,i would not buy timer again. it was a nightmare to get it to work. called intermatic--they lead me thru programing. very difficult to do. now it is finally working after 2 callls and 2 defective timers. try another timer.
2,Died after a few years,"I'm not sure how long these things should last, but I had two that were installed five years ago and they died at the same time. Maybe it's a mechanical issue where it just wears down after a while. Anyway, I'm going to try an electronic one this time. I'm way too lazy to figure out my circuit breaker again."
2,No improvement over the old model,"I used four Intermatic timers of this type over the past twenty years. They were easy to use (only one programming mode), reliable, and durable. This model is a step down from them. There are several programming modes, making the instructions more complicated and causing much doubt as to which mode is operative and whether or not the programming is successful. In addition, it is too easy to make unintentional contact with the switch when programming, causing mistakes. I have learned the idiosyrcracies of this timer and can use it now. I don't understand why Intermatic didn't leave well enough alone and continue the older, simpler model. I don't recommend this switch to a newbee; find another model."
3,Great idea if it would adhere to what I've programmed in!,This unit does not want to keep the schedule I have programmed in. It has a mind of its own and turns on and off whenever it feels like it even 'tho I've done the troubleshooting suggestions.
1,It's too bad it doesn't work...,"I was excited to find this product on line because I could never find one in the stores and needed to replace the one I had for three years. My current timer will turn the lights on and off manually but the timer isn't working now. When I tried to install the new one, nothing worked! You can't even manually turn the lights on/off! I put the old timer back in and will buy a plain light switch to replace it. If anyone knows of another timer with only two wires, I'd like to know. I only have two wires in my wall so I can't install the newer timers that have four wires. (black,white,green,red) I won't waste money buying another one of these Intermatic timers."
3,Wall switch timer,"This is the 3rd I purchased. First one lasted 8 yrs. The 2cd lasted 4 months. Yes, I am buying a 3rd to replace the one that stopped working. I love what it does and it is still the only thing I can find to replace a single light switch in a row of 4 light switches. If I could find something that would allow me to keep my current switch plate, I would try it."
3,"Easy to install,ok timer","A little difficult to set the timer,but once set,works well. Not 100% accurate with keeping exact time,loses a few minutes a day (not terrible). Very simple to install though and I am NOT handy."
2,Inexpensive and Short-Lived,"Pros: Inexpensive, easy install (there aren't four wires coming out of this thing, I only have two coming out the wall), unlike some timers, this guy is small and will actually fit in the J-box.Cons : Burn-out or malfunction after about two years, no longer carried by retailers around here. Does not work with CFLs.Note : Instructions are at Intermatic web site, also they can be easily scanned to a PDF on your PC."
1,Disappointed is an understatement.,"I ordered an in wall timer...a NEW, unopened item so I thought. When it arrived I was shocked to find that what I received was something that not only had been cut open and obviously returned by someone, but part of the packaging was missing and it was crudely taped back together. It actually looks like it might have installed and then returned. This is NOT a merchant I want to do business with again."
1,Poor Product,"All functions seamed working properly right after installation. I tried to adjust the timer to increase/decrease to trigger the on/off mode then the timer was malfunction. To me, this product is very poor performance. I replaced the current EJ351C with the cheap one (Wood 59745 Switch Timer - cost $12 bucks) and it solved all the problems."
1,"Do not waste your time on ""Used Like New"" switches","I have used these timers for years and never had a problem with them. Last year I broke one accidentally while moving some furniture and ordered several ""Used Like New"" switches through Amazon. These switches are not available locally so I thought I would replace the broken one and keep a couple as back ups. The first switch lasted less than a year and stopped working. The next two were dead out of the box and the return period is over--Should have tested them when I first got them. Don't waste your time on the used models--hopefully the ""New"" product is reliable."
4,Simple and reliable,"I have tried more sophisticated digital timers, but these are quite reliable and simple to adjust. They do require adjustment during the year, but there are no batteries to wear out, and making adjustments takes less than a minute. I have used about 6 of these without any problems thus far."
1,Less Than Worthless,"From past experience, these Intermatic Timers used to be well-made/reliable. However, after recently installing two timers and having to return them for replacements, I have concluded that the current defects were not a fluke. The quality control on these timers has apparently been abandoned. The first timer wouldn't turn on, the second timer literally fell apart when I was pushing it back into the electrical box, and the third timer (soon to be returned) has developed a mind of its own...turning on and off when it feels like it. Not only do these timers waste consumers' time to install and having to return them to Amazon (great return policy), it is a safety issue."
2,Save Your Money,"Timer worked reliably, so far as it is designed to, for a year or so and then began to turn on the light that it controlled earlier and earlier each cycle---clearly defective. Of course, the warranty expired two weeks before this began happening, so I am in the market for a new timer.Reliability issues aside, I will not be purchasing another timer of the same model due to the fact that it was a pain to have to regularly reprogram the timer to follow a dusk-to-dawn schedule anyway (it's a moving target), so I am now searching for a somewhat higher quality, self-adjusting timer."
1,These Always Break,"I'm not sure I've ever owned one of these that has lasted for at least two years. The previous one I had only lasted 18 months. The newer one only lasted July to September before it stopped working. It's too late to get a full refund from Amazon, so I am contacting the company directly. So far, I'm not impressed: their online customer service form is not working. If there were ANYONE else in the world making this particular product, I would buy it! (actually it seems there are a couple of other manufacturers now on Amazon -- yay!) Maybe I should start my own company! But anyway -- don't buy this if you can help it!"
4,"40 Watt Minimum, No Wall Plate","The enclosed instructions state this timer requires a 40 watt minimum load so I stopped there and decided to bring it back since it wouldn't meet my needs. I'm surprised it doesn't include a wall plate though. It isn't a standard shape at all so you're stuck going without a wall plate, or trying to find the one thats made for it which the store I bought it at didn't have."
1,NOT FOR USE WITH CFL,"It should say on the description of the product ""NOT FOR USE WITH CFL""Have return product very very very unhappy (Pissed off). Could have bought the correct model if this was pointed outreally sucks........."
2,Not happy with these,"I bought three. The pic was not clear enough to tell me whether I needed a switch or socket plate, so I also bought some socket plates. Well, they need switch plates. I immediiately had problems with the fit of these inside my existing boxes. These items are big and they take up a lot of box room. The connect mechanism was ok but took a little work. The front looks cheap and flimsy.The most frustrating was after the installation, I have had trouble controlling on one of the timers and this means I have to go through the effort of replacing it, which is a hassle. When guest try to use these, they look at me puzzled. The device is also not very good looking, almost something out of the sixties and sticks out way too far. It doesn't math anything. In the end, I am very disappointed and would never recommend these to anyone."
2,Very unhappy with both the purchase and the quality of the timer.,"Seemed like the timer was already returned to the retailer, then sold to me. It never worked properly as the timer just was not accurate in the on it off controls. I unhooked it and it now rests on my work bench. Should I return it to Amazon?"
1,dont reinvent the wheel,"Why do companys need to re invent the wheel.All I want,and most people,except men who like toys,is a timer that goes off and on at a certain time.This timer is a pain in the ass.I bought 20 of them ,I live in Antigua in the Caribbean,so it will cost more than what I paid for them to re ship them to the US"
1,poor product compared to alternative,"I have gone through five of these both at my own house and that of a relative. At first I though they were OK even if they were cumbersome to set up. But only one of the five provided reliable service for more than two years. None would work reliably with CFLs beyond the first week. I didn't realize how much better a wall switch timer could be until I bought Aube T1071. Now I wonder why I ever bothered with this Intermatic. When I read some of the reviews praising the Intermatic EJ351C, I have to wonder what other products it is being compared to. The Aube is so much more logical and easier to set up. The caveats on the Aube T1071 are:1) it requires a neutral wire in the electrical box2) it requires a ""decora"" switchplate (switch plate with large rectangular opening)I do not have enough experience yet to say how longlasting the Aube is, but just in terms of set up and operation, it is far superior to the Intermatic."
4,Timer works on second try,"Have had one of these timers on my garage/basement light for 8 or 9 years. It finally gave out so I purchased another one from Amazon. This timer is easy to install and does NOT require connection to the neutral wire. However, the first one I received was DOA. Reported it to Amazon and they shipped a replacement right out and provided a prepaid return label for the dead one. Received second timer and it works great. One caveat, the original timer killed CFL bulbs. Only recommend using incandescent."
2,NG with fluorescent,It was not made clear on line that this timer can't be used with a fluorescent light. I returned it.
3,It's okay.,"This timer came installed in the home I purchased five years ago. It is really great having the outdoor light turn on and off on a programmed setting. I agree with other users that it could be better. Mine recently stopped turning on the light at all, and I can't even manually turn it on. I am now looking for something a little better rather than replacing it with the same one. Intermatic makes a digital one I might try."
2,failed to operate properly,installed item five (5)times - failed to function after all attempts - previously used older version from manufacturer - suggest going back to former model
3,Programmable light timer,Timer works as advertised with exception that indicator light does not illuminate to show power to lights when programming the device.
4,So far-so good,"Intermatic EJ351C 120 Volt 24-Hour Programmable Mechanical Security TimerThis is the only product of its type that we are able to find. It usually works just fine but it is a little touchy and sometimes we have a problem with it. It seems that if we reprogram it, then it is fine again."
5,It's brightened my life,"This is one stupendous product. It has a full 24 hour (not 22 or 23) hour timer...and it turns my light on AND off.The two wire thingys made installation a snap...though it would have been better if I had followed directions, turned off the electricity before installing and avoided that nasty trip to the emergency room. The family tells me that watching me standing there jumping around was quite entertaining."
1,Programable Switch,"In most cases had to program two, three or four times before it actually started to work. I purchased 3 and only one is working now. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Intermatic EJ351C 120 Volt 24-Hour Programmable Mechanical Security...,Intermatic EJ351C 120 Volt 24-Hour Programmable Mechanical Security... This product did not work at all due to a broken connection inside the unit.
1,poor timer mechanism,the timer is very poorhas to be constantly reset to turn on and off at the designated timei hate it
1,Bell Fitness Solar Belt,"Bell Fitness Solar Belt (One Size Fits Most)This has been a most disappointing belt. Number one, it falls apart with hardly any wearing. Number two, the prices charged are outrageous for the amount of wear it is capable of.I would like to get a real belt that wears well and effectively for a long time of exercise."
2,What you pay for.,"Purpose of the belt was to keep the lower back warm while exercising. It works, does not slip. I would have paid more for a more sturdy neopreme fabric, thus adding some support. As i said you get what you pay for."
5,fast delivery and cheap price,They offer very fast and exact delivery service. That is important to me.They also provide cheaper price. I was satisfied.
3,Could be better,My stomach is my problem area eeing as that's where i gain my weight mostly. I wish that the belt was a bit broader and a bit longer. Apart from that it does make you sweat as for help with losing your tummy having noted that yet although to be honest i don't use it every day seeing as i only have one and iwash it after every use.
4,good quality,"the quality of this is good, and it survives washes (don't put it in the dryer though). don't buy the larger size of this, because it will probably fit most anyone alright with room to spare."
4,Back to the Future Part III Music Score CD,"This Varese Sarabande music score CD for Back to the Future Part III(1990) is a solid package. It has Alan Silvestri's music score as well as an instrumental version of ZZ Top's Double Back. A ""special edition"" of this soundtrack should be released one day. Back to the Future Part III takes place in 1885 and Silvestri flavors the music score with ""Western/Aaron Copland"" style music. Some of the themes and melodies from this music score can be heard in Back to the Future The Ride(1991).Some of the tender music would become the ""genesis"" of the Forrest Gump theme music. Alan Silvestri also wrote music for the Western film Young Guns 2(1990). The Back to the Future franchise has survived through Back to the Future The Ride, Back to the Future The Animated Series, Back to the Future The Game for the Nintendo Wii and Playstation 3, fan fiction, spoofs, and more. This CD is worth the cash."
4,Great soundtrack! Appropriate feel.,"I really like this soundtrack. While it is a bit divergent from the other two, it is appropriate in it's style and delivery. One beef that other have mentioned is the out of order tracks. I tried to figure out the best linear track and it could go:Main TitleIndiansHill ValleyThe HangingDoc to the RescueThe Future Isn't WrittenWe're Out of GasThe Science Experiment (Train Part 1)At First SightIt's Clara (The Train Part 2)The KissDoublebackGoodbye ClaraWake-up juiceThe ShowdownPoint of No Return (The Train Part 3)Doc ReturnsEnd CreditsWhile not perfectly correct, I think it's pretty close to being in chronological order this way. Great soundtrack!"
2,A big disappointment,"I was expecting so much more from this book, and I was disappointed with what I got. The photographs are beautifully done, but the contents of the pictures were so safe and conservative and devoid of personality. Not what I would expect from a book dealing with French taste -- which appeals to me usually for it's bravery and panache in it's interior design. About the only thing the rooms in this book shout to me was money. More money than style. More desire to impress than true chic. I want to see personality in interiors, and this book presents a heartless, soul-deadening succession of very expensive, very uninteresting rooms."
5,This book is delightful!,"I place this books among my top favorites in the decorating category (and I own many). Each time I flip through this book I see some new ideas that I didn't notice before. The are many beautiful pictures but the text is fun to read as well. The book helps to give you a feel for the way the French live and feel about their homes. Betty Lou Phillips also wrote French by Design which I also enjoyed, but of the two books French Influences is my favorite."
3,Puts the French on Pedestals,"The book is written as if the French have a monopoly on good taste. B. Phillips gushes over the French lifestyle to the point of annoyance. I found myself saying, enough already! I got the book because I've travelled to France since I was a kid and now I'd like to decorate my home with French influences. But after reading her book, with its genuflecting and contradictions, I was turned off. An example of contradiction: At one point the book states that the French are not ostentacious and prefer simple, tasteful items in the home. But from the interior pictures of mansions, that hardly seems to be the case. Also, I couldn't see any children being happy in these homes. They look like hotels and museums. The book had one very redeeming quality. The guides outlining ""must haves"" are very good."
3,"good so far, not great","the product is fine so far, hasn't mildewed yet, but the weave is very loose, not as tight/thick as one i used to have that was better quality, but this was about the only one i could find and it works as i expected--very good for exfoliating, although i got a little over enthusiastic one day and it left a small scratch on my face and my chest."
3,Pricey for the Product,"What was sent was not the brand that was ordered/pictured (that I had used before and liked). The wash cloth was not as crisp/firm as the brand I had ordered, though it functioned all right. It did get mold on it pretty quickly. I was somewhat disappointed, and probably wouldn't order again."
5,World's Best Wash Cloth,I've used these agave washcloths sine the 70's when I bought them in Piedras Negras. Sometimes they are hard to find and I'm delighted to have a reliable source for them. Thank you!
1,No 50s Music Here!,"Nice as the soundtrack music may be, you do NOT want to buy this CD if you're looking for the terrific 50s music that gave atmosphere to the movie. You CAN, however, find old ""Christine"" soundtrack LPs, some in mint condition and containing all the 50s music, at auction. It's worth it."
4,Great driving/background music!,"If you like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack in this thriller/killer background music. Wether you're driving down route 666 in an old Plymouth, or headin for hell in hearse, it's a must for any car!"
3,disapointed,this is an score soundtrack but everyones are interested in original 50s music. the question is; where we can find and buy that soundtrack$ im from mexico and heres not easy.alex luna
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this CD a while back, like many others, expecting to find the awesome collection of 50s music heard in the movie. While John Carpenter may be a fine composer, it is truly a disservice to have released this album instead of the ACTUAL movie music..."
1,The Original 50s Music From The Movie,"I have been trying for years to find this CD or even a listing of the music. Well I had to look no further. I found it last night on, yes you guessed it ....com."
3,Not what I thought but good,"Hi, when I bought this CD I thought it would have the real songs and I was pretty dissapointed about it, but later I dicided to like it and it was good. Don't bye this CD if you want the real songs."
4,Carpenter's smallest score.,"The score for Christine, unreleased for years, is finally available and well worth the wait. Largely felt more than heard in the film, the score shows Carpenter's gift for building the right mood with as little music as possible. It's also the first of his themeless mood scores. Highly recommended to Carpenter buffs."
4,Best book I've ever read,"I have just been transported into a U Boat and have experienced war, claustrophobia, sex, fear, exhaltation, depression, sadness, joy, and bereavement -- all from this book. Buchheim's descriptions are total -- they grab you and PUT you into the places and the situations. I'm shocked at my reaction to this book. I think I'll read it a dozen more times in my life -- and I'm 72. This is not a recommendation to you to read this book: this is an ORDER to read it."
3,Helpful Home Life,"The book is nicely written--from a Christian perspective. Mostly helps with mothers of sons who have to share them with ""the wife"". Some tips were helpful for relating to my own mother-in-law and being a mother-in-law. I am in a group using the book for group discussion. Lends itself somewhat to this type of setting."
2,i was hoping for more,"It is a good book, very basic. I can see it mostly helping those people who don't seem to see the world through others eyes. I was looking for more solid advice. It's mostly just stories and other people situations, there no real solutions or advice. Would I recommend it a friend? Maybe, but I would recommend Leadership and Self Deception by the Arbinger Institute first."
2,Be aware that it is written from an evangelical Christian perspective,"I was looking for help dealing with a problematic mother-in-law relationship, so I ordered this book. I found reading some of the personal stories in the book helpful, but I didn't realize that it would be so clearly from an evangelical Christian perspective. I didn't find that aspect helpful for me, although I'm sure it might be for others who share that point of view.Also, the author is not a professional psychologist or family therapist, so those looking for that type of perspective and advice should look for a different book."
1,Too Religious,"This book was not what I expected. Within the first 2 pages, the author is reciting the bible. Unfortunately, I didn't even finish the book because I felt that I couldn't relate to the biblical passages on a realistic and practical level."
2,The Mother-in-Law Dance: Can Two Women Love the Same Man and Still Get Along?,"I would have liked to know how much the author relied on biblical references and that her religious beliefs were the basis for all solutions in this book. While some of the references were pertinent, I don't like spending my money to have someone else espouse their religious beliefs. I didn't investigate the book thoroughly enough before I bought - had I know the pure religions influence of the content I would not have purchased it."
3,Wouldn't go out of my way to buy this book,"I wasn't enthused to find out there were so many biblical references in this book. I am a spiritual person in my own way and was just looking for some advice on having a healthy relationship with my future mother in law. I didn't enjoy reading all the ""extra"" bible stuff. Sorry!"
4,objective and not just ripping on your in-law,"yes, it has biblical references but i don't think it interferes w/ the points that the writer tries to make. it's great because it gives insight into what your mother-in-law might be thinking/feeling and why and therefore gives you a better understanding of their actions, but it does a really good job of identifying or empathizing with your own feelings and needs. the book doesn't take sides and is non-offensive so its a book you can actually give to your mother-in-law to read in order to get a better understanding of where YOU stand and how to act accordingly. Again, some references are biblical but often can apply to anyone. ie. ""He who opens his mouth less is wise"" referring to ""the less advice/suggestions you shell out voluntarily, the more likely your advice will be heeded"". Still reading it but finding it helpful so far."
5,Beautiful cards!,"These cards are beautiful and durable. I bought them to hang up in my daughter's nursery. They teach the names of 26 flowers, one for each letter of the alphabet."
4,Instant wall art,"I found these on another website and they cost alot more money. I bought some 8X10 frames and these become an instant collection of wall art. Some of the flowers are very off the wall and weird,but overall it is a great set for the money."
3,ddwilliams74,I've worn the same Speidel Twist-O-Flex band for over 20 years and when it broke I had to have another. The new band is OK but does not compare in quality to the old one I had. I'm sure the new band won't last 20 years.
4,Now this is a true MIX!!!!!,"1st of all I don't normally purchase a Dj mix cd because I get bored with them very quickly. I'm a victim of getting bored of sub-genre mix compilations mainly because of their repetitive nature.NOW HERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO ANY OF THE DJ MIXED CDs!!Armand Van Helden took me on an Odyssey across the nightlife of New York in a way that I've never experienced before.An impressively SEAMLESS blend between modern house to electro-80s to classic Rock anthems. Totally and utterly amazing!! I actually felt like I was club-hopping through many diverse clubs in a wonderful whirlwind of vibes that could only be provided by a great veteran to the club scene.This MIX had a grip on my attention. I couldn't get enough!Armand Van Helden, I tip my hat."
2,"five stars, but...","There's no doubt that VAN HELDEN is a great dj. There's no doubt, that this one may be a great mix. There's no doubt, that these songs may be anthems of New York club scene. There's no doubt, that the album may ""represent that feeling of nightlife, that feeling of going out..."", as VAN HELDEN says himself in the intro. And there's no doub't that it may do it really well.I haven't been there, i know nothing about it. And i know, the album isn't meant for me then. But still i wan't to say that. For an outsider, theese tracks sound cool. Songs are familiar, have heard them, like them, but there are no personal memories included. And that's why, for a non-NYC-clubber this cd may seem a bit pointless. These hits by themselves are not endearing enough to charm all music lovers.So take this poor piece of review just as a warning. If NY city-culture is not a part of your life, there's a chance, you won't see the appeal of this album."
2,not the greatest cd ive ever bought,"i heard the song My My My on the internet, and listened to it day and nite, thought his cd was worth buyin if that song was that good, but it wasnt. its got electroclash, funky vintage rock, dance punk and Eighties pop hits, kind of a weird mix. The eighties pop hits are ok but its the 2000s. i, personally, wouldnt recommend it. I would have rather burned My My My on a cd with other songs."
4,It is a useful tool.,"Although I have not yet finished reading the entire book, portions of it have served as a useful reference tool."
1,Worst Condition I've Ever Seen,"While this book is listed as hardcover, they actually send you a paperback version of the book still for the full $111. This is by far the WORST quality book I have ever seen. All of the pages are faded, most of which you cannot even read. I buy many books from Amazon and this is the first time I've ever had to return one. Do NOT buy this book! I thought, ""It can't be that bad."" But trust me, it is! The publisher should be ashamed. I feel bad for the authors who are stuck with a publisher producing such a low quality product."
2,poor quality,Effective Literacy Instruction K-8: Implementing Best Practice (5th Edition)I purchased this book for a college class I'm taking. The book was supposed to be in hard back and it arrived in paperback. The text itself is so light that I can hardly read it! Pretty ironic for a READING book!
3,Effective Literacy Instruction K-8: Implementing Best Practice,I thought I ordered the 5th edition and received the 4th edition????
1,Lame,"There are many great software programs for children and this isn't one of them. It is simply lame, my 4 year old was done with it in 15 minutes. Jumpstart World programs are definitely the best in the biz."
5,Great product!,"These vitamins are great, I tried several types and these, my 8 month old daughter takes just by themselves! I highly recommend them!"
3,"very good taste, possible allergy","my 1.5 y.o. son has been taking the vitamin for 1 week, and suddenly he started having a runny nose and sore throat even though he's never gotten sick before; it might be a coincidence but it was worth noting since two others mentioned it in their reviews. On a positive note, the taste of the vitamin is very good(I tried it myself) and my son likes it. I think the bad-taste reviews probably were given by people who didn't read the instructions on the bottle - ""shake well"", otherwise they end up eating the oil that rises to the top instead of tasting the actual flavor."
3,Darn! I wish it would of worked,"I bought this because of the ""taste"" reviews. My daughter runs screaming from this. I even try to hide it in her morning fruit smoothies but she can smell it and taste it there too. If I put the vitamin in her smoothie she simply wont drink it.So, the best tasting vitamin... didn't work for us. :(I gave it three stars because I am going to keep trying!"
2,Vitamin Smell & Taste,"My four year old son is a very picky eater and I'm trying to find a vitamin supplement for him. The previous reviews on this product were favorable so I thought we would try it. The smell is so strong and can not be disguised in milk, apple juice, etc... It smells like vitamins and the taste was intolerable for both of us."
1,Our product smells bad with strong smell of vitamins,"We've been using this product (not bought from Amazon) for the last six months and loved it. Found cheaper price on Amazon and bought 2 bottles. Unfortunately, we have to return the 2 bottles we bought due to strong off smell of chemical/vitamins which we never had prior to this order. The product itself is good (although no iron, which I wish they have) and my kids love the taste. But I would not buy it from Amazon again. Maybe we got a bad batch, but still I don't want to test it again."
2,Long delivery broken product,Delivery of this product took one week longer than another product ordered the same day. The product was damaged when received. The cap was chipped allowing some of the liquid out. It was wrapped in bubble wrap so I am not sure how the cap was chipped. When my 3yr old was given the supplement he tried to spit it out. I am now searching for a similar product but not by this company.
1,Pointless!,"My son been taking this vitamin for about 2 months and during the last month he had a bronchitis, non-stop runny nose and a very serious ear infection. Not that the vitamin caused this, but they did not help his immune system at all!"
2,not wonderfull,"the product not that great. It has after taste, so we back to the expensive poly multi. Not sure why this vitaman that expensive the poly. This vitamin has soure taste and sweet and god knows what. They need to make something close to poly multi but cheaper for picky kids."
2,The kids hated it.,"Even the non-picky boy, even if I mixed it into orange juice. It may be superhealthy, but that's no use if the kid gags on it. Will not buy it again."
1,Unfortunately my toddler won't take this,"Although this multi vitamin looks like a great natural product, my daughter wouldn't take it! She hated the taste, and I have to admit it does taste pretty gross. We bought it for her when she was a little older than 1 years old. We had to give her gummy vitamins early because that's all she'd take. If I could have gotten her to take it I would be ecstatic!"
3,"Good multi, stains clothes","I bought this for my daughter while she was going through chemo and was impressed with the ingredients. She would take it from a syringe for a while, but a month or so after using it she decided she no longer wanted to take it and would spit it out. Unfortunately, it stained several of her shirts that she spit it out on. I quit giving it to her and now use the powdered multi for kids."
4,"Does the job, gently",Vitamin syrup is easy on my brain since I have brain hypersensitivity. It is gentle enough but a little weak on the vitamin side. It does the job though.
4,Trapped In Paradise Entraps You!!!,"3 brothers (Nicholas Cage, Dana Carvey, and Jon Lovitz) heist a bank in a little town known as Paradise. After robbing the bank, Cage, Lovitz, and Carvey find it rather difficult to leave with the money due to the FBI, their kidnapped mother, and two local police officers whose liscence plate begins with DUH! They constantly run into the locals who live a quaint little lifestyle and are always willing to lend a helping hand. With the starring of Cage, Carvey, and Lovitz, you'd think that it would be a hysterical movie. After watching it, the movie does have some funny moments,and the entire idea is kind of quirky, but overall it's not as funny as one would project. However, the movie is very compelling and it sucks you in. It really makes you want to move to Paradise!!! Overall it's a fun and chrarming movie that you could watch snuggled up to your loved one or with your kids."
1,Something wrong with dvd wont play,I have a multi region dvd player and this dvd wont play on it to expensive to send dvd back.
3,predictable lines,"corny at times, predictable, but a light-hearted film that the family can watch together. Cage looks out of place in a comedy."
5,Love this movie-hilarious & sentimental! Great Xmas film!,"We watched this movie several years ago by accident. We had never heard of the film, so didn't expect much from it. This is a silent winner! We love this movie! We're not into Christmas, but we love this film. Why? It is just too funny, memorable and touching. Synopsis: Just before Christmas, three brothers wander into the town of Paradise to rob a bank. The town is small town Americana straight out ot a Norman Rockwell picture. Because of circumstances that happen, they can't leave. Hence, they are trapped in Paradise. During the time in Paradise, they become adopted by the townspeople and learn about the true spirit of Christmas. Overall, this is a cute film, a feel good. I highly recommend it."
4,Paradise is excellent,"Seller shipped within 48 hours. However, seller would not give any discount for multiple DVD purchases. You do not save any money the more DVDs you buy from this seller. The DVD is listed as used yet worked as if brand new.Movie is quite funny and a freshing break from typical Christmas movies. Nicholas Cage fans will enjoy watching his ""early"" acting. Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey are at their best. Typical ""what else could go wrong"" movie."
4,Funny Christmas Movie,"This is one of my favorite holiday movies. I am a big fan of the off kilter holiday movies. Some of my favs include Elf, Scrooged, Rare Imports, Ernest Saves Christmas, and this goofy comedy. The performances by Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz are classic."
3,Not Great But One of the Better Christmas Movies,Our family was looking for a Christmas movie and stumbled upon this one. We were pleasantly surprised and found it better than other movies of the same genre such as Christmas Vscation.
1,Wrong movie,"I ordered a bunch of holiday-related movies before the holidays, some new and some used. Anyway one movie that i ordered was Trapped in Paradise which happened to be used. A week or two after receiving it, i put it in the DVD player and The Three Amigos came onto my screen. The seller put the wrong movie in the case before he or she shipped it and I didn't realize it until after the time frame that I could have returned it... Very upset about it. I wouldn't use this seller again!"
2,"Good premise, but just not funny","No matter how you cut this film up, or what you compare it to, it just is not funny. A great cast of Nicholas Cage, Dana Carvey, and John Luvitz can not deliver enough punch to the awful lines of this film. The idea behind this is two small time crooks (Carvey and Luvitz) learn of a plan in prison about a small town bank that is ripe for the picking. All they need is a little help once they get outside. The help is in the form of thier somewhat honest brother (cage). The characters played by Carvey and Luvitz are just annoying, and Cage is just flat. And to top it off, they tried to add a love connection in it, just plain bad. I forced myself to finish watching this in the hopes it would get funny, but it didn't. Save your change, don't get this."
1,Truly Awful -A waste of ten bucks.,"It's hard for me to believe that this movie has received an average Amazon rate of 4 stars. It makes me wonder if the same person hasn't written in 7 or 8 times. I am a devoted Cage fan, and so went into this film with high expectations. As a whole, I found the film a complete disappointment. The gags were weary, the dialogue was tiresome, and the plot was thin. Even the slapstick style humor was weak; almost Benny Hill-esque. The only reason to buy this film is to complete a Cage or Carvey collection, and even then, I'd make it last on the list. Everyone in this film has done better, funnier work. If you're really considering buying it, take your ten bucks down the street and give it to some homeless guy, or buy a handful of lottery tickets, or anything else at all."
5,Buy this CD now!,"Sometimes live albums are released that are of an almost bootleg quality, sometimes you get those that are the run of the mill concert recording, and then (very) occasionally you get a recording that makes you feel that you are really there (and if you don't you feel you're there, you will wish you had of been! ). That is exactly what tracks 2-6 on this CD represent. They are all recorded in Johannesburg, South Africa, and the performances are absolutely stunning. Now all we need is Bon Jovi to release the whole of this concert on CD!"
1,a disgrace,"This is a typical entry in a terrible series - the recent complete Kinks reissue program out of England. The plan wassuperb. Each cd contains the a complete album unaltered plus ALL TRACKS RECORDED CONCURRENTLY that saw release. As a Kinks fan I bought the lot. I've since thrown them all away. The mastering is terrible. This is the worst of the lot, but they are all bad.Take one that is pretty fair, say Kinda Kinks and then a/b the tracks with same tracks off the Rhino Kinda kinks from some 10 years ago. No comparison. What a shame! The only recent reissue that made me angrier was 1 (the beatles) which is without a doubt the worst sounding reissue by a major rocker EVER. see my review at that site."
4,Nice looking shoes but un-breathable...,"It looks very nice and cute, but my boyfriend feels it's too hot and un-breathable for his foot, and it keeps his foot sweating when he wearing it."
1,Product not compatible and horrible tech support,"I purchased this because it was one of the very few multi-function print servers that listed my Canon MP830 MFP. When I received it, I tried to install it but it was not detecting the printer properly, it only saw the fax portion. I called tech support and they told me I had to call back between M-F 9-5 Pacific time to talk with a level 2 tech. I called on a Monday at 3 pacific and they said I had to call back the next day as their level 2 tech wasn't available. I called back on Tuesday at the same time, and I got the same run around, that I had to call back first thing in the morning. Since I work, I'm unable to do that and just decided to return the item back to Amazon, which so far has been the easiest thing to do thanks to Amazon's great return setup. I'm just going to spend a little bit more and by a network capable printer."
3,OK Product but software needs improvement,"I bought this product to use on a new Windows XP machine for a home network. It seems to do the job. However, when you switch users on XP you lose the printer connection and 2 screens pop up to warn you. Tech support was quite lame - suggested ""log off"" as the solution. Basically asking to limit XP functionality due to poor driver design. Havent seen to many other similar products so I am stuck with this for now and hope they will generate an updated driver."
1,"Software did not rerout the printer, have yet to get to work.","I have not been able to get the system to re-rout the print spool thru the print server to the printer. I only get the message, ""File failed to print"""
3,Still developing this product,"After several firmware upgrades, the server worked well. However, the software looses its connection to the printer once in a while. When this happens, you need to uninstall and reinstall the software. Customer service is pityful at best, somewhere in India. Response is up to 6 days. Phone support is for minor problems only then they refer you to email. 6 days X 4 firmware up grades."
3,server is so small,I was surprised by how small it is. I thought it would be the size of my router but it is half that size. I have it tucked away and out of sight. With the server being so small you do not have to worry about clutter on the desk.
5,For ALL Clubheadz!,If you are a clubhead or you love dance mixes or you like club mixes of popular songs then this is for you! It's just like going to the club but it's free and its great excercise music! (ha ha ha) It is mixed just like it would be in the club and is mixed by 2 of the greatest remixers/DJ's of all time.....THUNDERPUSS! This is a hit and everyone should get it because it is a great addition to anyone's CD collection! The songs are all the good cuts and theyare remixed great! I wish thunderpuss would have remixed all of them and then mixed the CD together because their sound is great!
4,He's A Hustler!,"Older women like me, pursued by acquisitive poor men, will really enjoy this film. First of all, it's sadly amusing to the inth degree. Here we have a sensitive, pretty but fading, highly intelligent, well educated and well read older woman who's lost two husbands and and is lonely. Along comes an attractive, viable man about her own age. Who wouldn't perk up for that? But what she gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for. You've got to see it."
2,Does NOT include Instant Streaming of the same film!,"If you purchase this through Amazon, you supposedly get free instant streaming access to the film -- unfortunately it's a completely different film that streams. So if you think you get to watch the British romantic thriller, think again, at least until the DVD arrives."
1,It broke after 2 weeks.,"The press mechanism broke in the 2nd week of a 3-week sailing vacation. It can't be fixed, so it's of no use any more. Before that, it made great coffee and appeared to be perfect for use on the sailboat."
2,Broke after using camping 1 time,"I was really upset that after using this for camping 1 time the inside of the press broke into pieces, I can't even fix it. For one thing these presses inside should not be made of plastic there is to much pressure."
1,Argh!,"I am from Milwaukee, and was so excited to see a video clip showcasing the best beer in the States. How disappointing it was for me to click on ""play"" and see the Chicago skyline!!! Free or not, how difficult is it to put in the correct description and video title?"
1,It wasn't Milwaukee!!!! It was Chicago...,"So, here we are... Waiting to see my husband's home town and the freaking video was of Chicago! Where is the beer capital of the country? MILWAUKEE!!! Chicago is pizza...It was free, so it was only disappointing."
1,Buyer beware,I got my dvd set in the mail and the second disc was not seated properly and was horribly scratched on the bottom. I did an rma and was sent a new dvd set. When the new one showed up it was the same problem. Amazon was awsome about giving me a refund but the dvd manufacture needs to address the problem with the dvd not being seated.
5,Excellent for the Eating Clean Lifestyle,We have been eating clean for over 5 months now and feeling better everyday. I bought this for baking and it is great and easy to use. This is a much better price then my local stores. The Wholesome Sweetener site has a lot of really good recipes too!
2,Not happy with quality,"I ordered four dinner plates and was not happy with what I received. One plate had a minor scratch on the rim. One plate was made in Malaysia even though the description stated that the Spode dinner plates were of high quality and made England. And finally, the colors were a bit dull and murky compared to my Spode that I have in my own collection. These plates were said to be new and sold by Amazon. I returned all four plates and received a full refund."
1,Junk Spode,"We have many pieces of Spode Christmas Tree dishes. But the last ones we got as gifts at Christmas 2008 are absolutely inferior. The first thing we noticed was that the Christmas Tree design on the plates was like a pasted on decal, not part of the dish itself. With the older plates, if you closed your eyes and touched the tree design, you couldn't feel it, it was part of the porcelain. But with the newer plates, it does feel like a decal pasted on. It is definitely inferior.And of course these newer ones are made in China or in Thailand. I would NEVER eat from any of these plates (since the melamine scare). Now, I am just looking where to dump them. I don't want to sell or give them to anyone. So, they will probably end up in the garbage.A bit of advice - don't buy any spode dishware."
3,FYI - Spode is not the same Spode you've known in past...,"Now seeing several posts from buyers unsatisfied with recent purchases of Spode china (particularly the Christmas Tree pattern). Be aware that Spode was purchased by Portmeirion and has now off-shored this pattern to Malaysian and Chinese manufacturers. That said, you can continue your collection but the quality will not be the same. :(Portmeirion also purchased Royal Worcester..."
1,Terrible for the money spent,This design is very pretty but the first time we poured a cup of coffee in the mug it cracked and immediately and started leaking. This set is not dishwasher safe nor microwave safe. I am very disappointed and now I'm stuck with a full set of dinnerware that really can't be used!
4,"good packaging, arrived fine","A gift for my wife. She likes the Spode dishes, but was missing a set of mugs. These work well as additions to her collection."
1,Chipped,"Dishes were badly chipped. I was really disappointed with this with this product. This was my second try with this order, the first order never arrived. Huge waste of time."
1,Spode Christmas Tree Mugs,"Our family has owned the Spode Christmas Tree china for over thirty years. The pieces are used for the month of December every year. They still look like the day we purchased them. The originals were made in England. Several years ago, production was sent to China. The quality of these pieces is just awful. Eight mugs had to be discarded due to crazing. Wine glasses are a different color pattern from the originals and the Christmas trees are haphazardly placed on the different pieces. I should have asked the seller about the country of origin. My mistake. We have not used them yet, but don't expect much. I should have returned them, but after Christmas, I was too tired and didn't need one more trip to the post office. I would advise anyone who wants Spode Christmas tree items to try ebay and look for older pieces stamped made in England. China really needs to step up their quality control if they want to stay in the manufacturing business."
3,Bowls were broken,"Love the pieces, but several were broken. Not packaged well. In each box, at least one piece was broken, usually the bowl."
5,Lively and Thought-provoking,"What a refreshing story! My daughter and I loved it. From the beginning to the end, children (and adults alike) will be caught up in the wonderful imagery created and clever ""sounding"" words chosen by its author. By celebrating the spirit of the individual and appreciating the simplicity and beauty of nature, children are introduced to Thoreau in a delightful and marvelously illustrated way. The Trouble with Henry is bound to be a favorite, especially among younger readers."
5,The Trouble with Henry,"Wonderful book, my adult friends loved it as much as the children. Thoreau was cool 150 years ago and knew then what ignorant people like GW Bush will never know. This book should be read by everyone!!!"
4,The plane manages to stay in the air,"Well, I'm a die hard fan of the Die Hard siries, ( Ha ha ha.... ) and also of their music. Kamen has quite a gift for music in that genre. Even though it's quality composing, it soon gets boring. It shouldn't be the only CD you have on a long trip or otherwise your head will explode. There is also some music in the movie that's not on it, which dissapointed me a bit. For example, the music that you hear as John McClane fights the leader terrorist on the wing of the plane. Still, this heart-pounding soundtrack will satisfy fans, even though it should be twice as long."
3,A Powerfull action soundtrack!,"This is a very good score from the genius called Michael Kamen. If you're a die hard and film music fan,this is for you!"
3,Decent Album,"This is a good Social D album but not great. It sounds a bit overproduced or mis-mastered. Some of the best songs are done better on Live at the Roxy. It's a solid add to a record collection, but for first timers I recommend the Self Titled (Social Distortion Social Distortion) or the afore-mentioned Live at the Roxy, both of which are great."
4,You'll like Social D even if you don't like punk,"I have 3 Social D cds and all of them are slightly different and all of them were well worth the money. Instead of giving you two good songs and the rest are trash this band(unlike most punk bands)can actually play their instruments and write good tunes.This album is more rockabilly than some of their other stuff. I would have given it five stars but I don't think it's quite as good as White Light,White Heat,White Trash, which came later and is a little more punk. It's a shame people would rather listen to pop punk crap than good stuff like this."
5,Instant Classic,"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell is one of the best albums to come out of the nineties. Its filled with hard-driving freight train guitars and country soul with a punk attitude. Gritty songs like ""Cold Feelings"" and ""Bad Luck"" are legendary and never get old. The fact that Social D. never changed their style to fit the grunge scene of the early nineties and kept putting out great CD's makes me appreciate them even more. It doesn't get much better than this!"
4,Packs a Solid Punch,"Social Distortion's ""Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell"" is the band's best and most consistent album. The songwriting is nearly uniformly excellent and their Delta Bluesman-meets-Johnny Rotten style has never been more fully realized. The two singles were ""Bad Luck,"" and ""Born to Lose,"" which are typical of the whole album, hard luck bluesy lyrics sung over high energy guitar fury. Other standout cuts include the prison lament ""99 to Life,"" the (almost) tender ""Making Believe,"" and the burning rockers ""Cold Feelings"" and ""Sometimes I Do."" The rest of the material is nearly as good and this is one of those rare albums that really doesn't contain any clunkers.Overall, the best example of blues-punk you're ever liable to run across."
5,Cold Feelings in the Night!,"Highly Recommended This is as pure and driven a rock combo as you're likely to find on either side of the punk/rock fence. The songs are a hail of rough-edged but well-constructed originals. The band's sound is reminiscent of ""London Calling"" era Clash. ""Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell"" offers rock-steady tempos, grungy guitars mashing through meat-and-potatoes chord changes, the gravelly musings of lead singer Mike Ness. This is probably my favorite Social Distortion album, and the one that made me a fan for life."
3,A sensitive look at the fragility of relationships.,"Sisters fight. But who'd have thought that the bitterness would seep down to everyday life! Saaz is a sensitive portrayal of how fragile relationships, even the most real ones, can be and how they can cripple. Shabana's portrayal of the younger sister, subjected to torture by a selfish, scheming older sister deserves mention. Her fight for survival,the complexity of relationships she gets into, really tell a compelling tale.It doesn't end with that, her failed affair with a younger man, loved by her daughter,brings the focus back on relationships, this time, between mother and daughter. So eventually, one is left wondering at the complexity of life and an individual's struggle to establish her own identity. Very well told."
5,One of the best halloween soundtracks!!!,"This is one of the best soundtracks in the Halloween series. The first 5 songs are 80s hits, but they are an extra. I personally love Romeo, Romeo, and Sporting Woman. Next, are the actual Halloween songs. The Halloween theme is excellent, as it is much darker and more spooky. The other songs are really scary, and I should warn you not to listen to this while you are alone in your home at night!!!!"
4,Best to just skip the songs and listen to the moody score.,The producers of the Halloween 5 soundtrack choose to include many of the disposable 80s songs that clogged up the ambient soundtrack (i.e. they are either heard playing on a car radio or at the Halloween bash the teenage victims to be attend at the farm). Of course if you like that kind of music feel free to listen to it. However I do not and recommend to those who share my film score passion to simply skip them and move on to another fine Howarth offering.Parts of the score for Halloween 5 are darker and more claustrophobic than the one for part 4. It also invokes the growing supernatural elements this entry attempted to build into the story by using vocal sounding chants amongst the humming and thumping. The finale features an outstanding sounding cover of the Halloween Theme that will be a welcome addition to any horror fans library. Recommended.
5,Halloween 5 Soundtrack is the best!,"I have been a Halloween/Michael Myers fan for over 11 years now, and I must say that the Halloween 5 soundtrack rocks. First the music that you can just groove to like, ""Romeo, Romeo,"" and ""Dancin til Midnight."" I turn up the radio when the Halloween finale comes on! It is just the ultimate best cd with the best songs! You will want to play this cd over and over again."
5,Finally out on CD,"I've been waiting for this to be finally issued on CD after going through two vinyl copies (first being my grandfathers original version from 1955). Parts of this album have been issued before as four tracks on ""Interchanges '54"" (Sometimes I'm Happy, The Duke, Indiana, and Love Walked In) and ""Lover"" was issued on a Japanese compilation. Nothing compares to the entire work being on one CD (or record). The CD also has the advantage of having two additional tracks ""Taking A Chance On Love"" and ""Closing Time Blues"" added on at the end of where the record ended to make a fuller CD. This live performance is incredibly warm as the other reviewers have pointed out. It was recorded in a small NYC club and is very intimate. The intimacy is what makes this such a warm recording. It is a real shame that this album is an such undiscovered treasure by most of the people who are familiar with Dave Brubeck's music and finally issued by the record company."
4,Very Good Book,"I had to purchase this book for a class I took in college. Before I took the class, I used MS Excel every day for 3 years at my job. Within 2 weeks of using this thing, I more than doubled my knowledge of the program. It is fairly easy to use on your own for the first 2/3 of the book. The last 1/3 is pretty complex, however the average user will never need to do some of things in that section. I kept this book instead of selling it back to the bookstore, and still use it as a desktop reference. I highly reccomend it."
1,Things do not work as intended,"I am currently using this text for an Information Systems class. The examples do not work as intended. Stay away from this book, it is a piece of Garbage. The only reason the editorial reviews call it successful is because colleges and universities make their students use it."
5,Oh Happy Mistake!,"I ordered the tie on eye patch. Lo and behold, they came with elastic! However my husband was VERY pleased with the elastic. So I guess this seller is somehow psychic!!!"
1,Not built to handle an iPod,"Although the casing is great, the flimsy plastic clip provides no support for the iPod OR case. Mine broke within a couple of months. I'm just lucky my iPod lived through it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The casing is heavy, and the clip, flimsy. Be wary, buyer."
1,"No ""Danny Boy"" by Harry Conick Jr.","I too was looking for the jazzed up version of ""Danny Boy"" By Harry Conick Jr. but, sadly, it was not included. Too bad, because it was a great rendition of a classic song.DDD"
1,This is not the original soundtrack.,Listen to Danny boy. In the move it was sung by Harry Connick Jr. and that ain't him on the last track. Listen to the sample and you tell me. This is just another soundtrack rip-off album. It's a shame that there is not a score lower than 1.
1,a disappointment,"I purchased the CD because I was expecting to get two songs performed by Harry Connick,Jr. Namely, ""Danny Boy"", and ""Amazing Grace"". These were after all,in the movie! When you open then paper CD jacket there is a picture of Harry Connick, Jr. at the piano. But that's all of Harry Connick your going to get with this CD because the songs are missing.What a rip off. It is the ""bait and switch"" at it's finest I must say."
4,"Great album, but why no ""Danny Boy"" by Harry Connick Jr?","I love the music on this album - my other half and I just LOVED the film, so I had to get hold of the soundtrack. Was happy with the original music on there and the WWII-era swing stuff, but VERY disappointed that Harry Connick Jr's version of ""Danny Boy"" wasn't on it, which was one of the film's highlights for us - the lame 'boy-band' version plonked on the end of the CD annoys the crap outa me (Gen Y 'himbo' rubbish - NOT EVEN IN THE MOVIE! Why did they even bother putting it on the CD?)Other than that last track (the gaylord mangling of ""Danny Boy""), the CD is worth having."
4,Beautiful soundtrack,"I like this movie, and the music is moving. It gives the idea of the story and of the tragedy in the skies of WWII. I especially like ""amazing grace"", because it communicates a sense of purpose and the tense preparation for takeoff. Overall it is a nice soundtrack, with very nice swing pieces. Personally, I was a bit disappointed by ""Danny boy"" in rock version, I was hoping for the version actually sung in the movie."
4,Great Starter Book!,This book is great for the first time sausage maker! Great recipes and easy directions. From start to end this book makes it easy.
4,The sausage making cook book,The book has some good recipes for sausage . My Daughter and I have tried a few of them with ground pork and beef . I have more meat ready for us to make even more . We both like to try different types of sausage and seasonings .
4,Good overview by decendant of master home sausage-maker.,"Very readable book with lore and recipes handed down ""through the ages."" Good tips and the love of sausage-making are conveyed. Recipes are traditional, ethnic, but popular, realiable varieties. All are high in fat; nothing on the modern era of lower-fat, high-flavor, innovative contents. Few poultry recipes. A solid reference for the novice."
1,Not like the old dollheads,This dollhead's hair was falling out the minute we untaped her from the box - don't waste your time with this chincy toy.
1,would not recommend!,"1. This styling head is TINY!!!! Either I missed this in the description of it wasn't there. My guess is the latter. It is much smaller than any other head I have seen, which makes it hard to work with the hair because it is not very stable.2. The hair extensions do not change color with water...hot or cold. The only way we can get it to change color is with a hairdryer.....obviously not something I am going to let a 5 year do by herself.3. Hair falls out in clumps when you comb it. At the rate we are going she will be completely bald after the 3rd time we play with it.Overall, I would give this an ""F"".. spend the extra money and get one that is normal sized!!!!!"
1,ARCO's GED en español (sexta edición),"No le recomiendo este libro. Esta no es una buena traduccion de la version en ingles publicada por ARCO. La seccion sobre matematicas es particularmente mala! Una mejor opcion es comprarse el manual ""Barron's GED: cómo prepararse para el GED, edición en español"" traducido por Montserrat Vendrell.This book is misleading. ARCO presents this book as the Spanish version of ""Everything You Need to Score High on the GED"" by Seymour Barasch et al. That is not the case, the Spanish version is dull and poorly written (particularly the math section)."
1,Rather a warning,"The Region 2 DVD of Alain Resnais' ""Providence"" (or should I say David Mercer's) shown here being the Manga Films Spanish edition, I must warn, since all the reviews refer to the film, and certainly not to the DVD, that it is not - as the film was written, acted & filmed - in English... but dubbed into French. That's why I keep waiting for a good DVD, in its original version, without Gielgud's voice replaced by another.Miguel Marías"
1,Less than worthless,"I gave this book one star because it does, in fact, contain sample resumes and cover letters. But it contains nothing else! And the examples look like generic resumes to me; certainly nothing geared toward those re-entering the job market.The book is broken into three parts. The first is a few pages of work sheets where you write in your job history/experience/education.The second part is devoted to sample resumes.The last is a collection of cover letters.But nowhere is there any information as to why these examples were used. This is just a trip through a personnel person's file cabinet, nothing more."
4,Loved Movie..so I bought the score,"First and foremost, I thought the Abyss was a great movie, visually stunning. Another aspect of this fantastic movie was the score, which made certain scenes that much better. At times, the score was better than a scene. Alan Silvestri is a maestro, and this was one of his better works. I strongly recommend it to people who are fans of movie scores. This is one purchase you must have."
2,the end is pretty good,"Buy this CD for tracks 11, 12, and 13. The finale of the score is amazing, with a powerful build-up of the choir and orchestra. The rest of the score, sadly, is a waste of time. Track 1 rips off the main title to James Horner's BRAINSTORM, before settling into a repetitive percussion motif. Tracks 3 and 7 are merely recycled from Silvestri's PREDATOR score. Everything else is simply synth droning and boring ""atmosphere"" music. If it weren't for the last ten minutes of the score, I would sell this disc."
3,less spectacular than i thought,"Perhaps it is the Varese label. I've watched this film tons of times at Universal Cineplex in THX and later in Century City HPS4000 sound. I'm not sure if it is the mastering of this disc that they didn't go back to a digital master or what, but sonically this disc is inferior to other soundtracks I have. As to the music, I was rather dissapointed that only a few of the tracks are great. Read the other review(by Todd)."
5,One of the most moving musical scores I've heard,The music fills the theatre with a feeling of hope and accomplishment. Will give any person a lift when they need it most. Highly recommended.
4,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic soundtrack.Try to hear it in the dark and you will have an incredible experience.One of Silvestri's best score,for this amazing film.If you like his work,this is a must have."
3,"Good soundtrack, but loses intensity of the film","I really enjoyed the movie, but I found that the soundtrack was a little bit repetitive. I also felt that after the first three tracks the CD loses some of its energy. I would much rather invest my money on the video."
3,OK but could go deeper,"The funny thing about The Abyss is that it's s great film but I'd be hard pushed to say exactly why, or pick out which scene particularly makes it. Maybe I just like diving- enough that I once built a closed circuit breathing set. I don't have a TV so it was 8 years between when I heard about it and when I got around to seeing it. This soundtrack is fair enough but it misses out the music the guys actually listen to in the film, which is a shame. Listening to ""Too Much Pressure"" by The Selecter in a deep sea habitat has to be a deliberate joke, and a pretty good one. It is touches like that which mean you can't help but like the film and find the people in it believable. The thing they sing along to isn't bad either. It's a shame this music isn't on the CD as it means a lot more to the film than some of the 'background' stuff."
2,"Better to buy ""Cinema Choral Classics I""","I listened to the choral peace of the album (can't remember the title) on ""Cinema Classics I"" and thought that it would be a great score.After buying the CD, I felt really jilted. From then, I've decided that I'll watch a movie before buying its score, or at least listen to the score before buying it. (This happened well before Amazon and other on-line CD services)I was really disappointed with this - especially that it came from the Silvestri, who gave us the beautiful ""Forrest Gump"" score."
4,Blunts,Blue Sky is a humerus story of a boy not quite ready to hunt in experience or what might be practical. A good starter book for young readers.
4,Frank really sings!,"I grew up listening to the song ""MASH"". And to do a movie spoof on the song was great. I liked all the songs in the movie. Some of the acting was a little lame but in the overall scheme it worked."
1,Horrid movie,"This is a sad knock-off of the classic film Rocky Horror. it is over the top campy, the comedy is predictable and the movie is horrible, I would not wish a viewing of this movie on anyone. save yourself and dont watch it."
5,Great Book,"I just got this book and it touches all bases. This great for anyone that want to get in shape, not just surfers. It has cardio, stretching, strengthing, balance, enruance and more. One thing I like was the flexibilty assessment, which tells you what areas you should work on.I wish there was a video"
2,Pretty poor,"I have no idea where all these stars are coming from. Basically alot of stuff you already know. Nothing big at all and like half the book is dedicated to those swedish 3' diameter squish balls. If you are into those balls this may good for you, otherwise I don't recommend. nice sf surf shop plug though."
1,Too Small For Anything,"When I bought my Lumix DMC-TZ5 through Amazon, this was the case featured at the bottom of the screen. It looked like just what I was looking for, so I bought it. But when I got it, it didn't fit the camera or, for that matter, anything else! It's a nice little case that seems to me great for carrying a pack of cigarettes (small) and little more. Amazon shouldn't feature such things without making sure they fit. I have a small handheld computer/phone and the case is too small for even that, and it's a good deal smaller than the camera.Don't buy the products Amazon features with any product unless you know dern well that it'll fit. I don't know who the yo-yos are who determine what gets featured with what, but they're most likely guessing.Even if something fit this little case, it's way overpriced."
5,An audio delight.,"This is my favorite soundtrack by Danny Elfman. A goofy upbeat oompapa through and through. Each trak is as daring and provocative as the previous and will have the listener humming and toe tapping to it's upswing beat. Each trak will have you dancing in the aisles and swinging from the cieling fan as Oingo Boingo and the rest belts out each tune like Benny Goodman on [something]. Yes, and the swarthy tootlings of Squeezit the Moocher will have you screaming for more. I highly recomend this CD to any highbrow misic lover."
3,"Where in the world is Pico and Sepulveda, Pico and Sepulveda...","Unfortunately, that song isn't included on the soundtrack cd."
5,Absolutely excellent,"As a young married woman, I know exactly the sexual pressures she discusses. It's real and it's oppressive. Kudos to her for actually taking a stand against this objectification of women! This is a handbook on how to be a person instead of a sex object."
5,A++++,This is a great pole jack. Excellent value. Even has a removeable rubber pad up top so you don't have to use a block of wood in between when supporting things like an aluminum engine oil pan. Will definitely buy an additional one if needed!!
4,Power choirs,"I was truly intrigued by this music after listening.(I forgot about the film!) It eminates a richness and power in its tracks, which feature loud choirs and many horns. Most of the tracks are dark, yet the more uplifting tracks really convey a power to them. I reccomend this to both Goldsmith fans and film music fans."
4,Magically sucked in...,"I had been avoiding this book for the title for several years walking by it on my bookshelf. I can't even remember when or where I picked it up. I dusted it off the shelf after promising myself to be a more virtuous reader and vowed to read a chapter a night. I couldn't stop until I was halfway through the book.I hadn't know a large part of the book was set in Sedona, a place I have visited and loved for many a year now. Or that the character was thinking many of the same things I was in visiting there. But the soothing memory of the healing energy of that place swept over me as I read the pages. As the main character thinks back to here time on Bell Rock I kept returning there again and again in my mind.I good read for anyone who loves the mystery of the desert or the orient. Or has ever felt alone in the world."
5,"Informative, enlightening, and well-organized.","Like many Americans, I didn't know much about our country's principles of government or its legal system. This book helped me to become more knowledgeable about both. I admit, this is not reading I would choose to curl up with in front of the fire; this was part of a requirement for my MBA. However, I will remember what I've learned in this text long after my class ends. Having previously been clueless about the legal system, it is now exhilarating to read about, say, how the nine US Supreme Court Justices are dealing with the aftermath of the Gore vs. Bush debacle and actually understand what is going on. The chapters are well-organized and easy to understand. There are even helpful study tips and ways to brief a legal case in the beginning of the text. After completing this book, I not only feel better equipped to handle business decisions, but also feel empowered and enlightened for better understanding our great country."
5,An interesting textbook - is that allowed??,"This book was purchased for a Master level Business Law class. I was fully prepared to use it in place of my sleeping pills. But it was interesting! The concepts are covered well, but not so in-depth that you get lost in the legalese. The cases in each chapter illustrate the laws in action, and the charts and text boxes throughout each chapter make the concepts easier to understand and apply. There are definitions in the back, and a very good index for finding specific topics fast. I actually found my self enjoying this class! This book gives a very good basic grounding in much of what a business person needs to know about the law."
3,ok??????,"this had some good matches but i did not like the lights out death match because you could not see anything,hint hint!!!!!other than that a medium good dvd from fmw.ps:that was my first fmw dvd and i just orderd yokohama deathmatch that will be very good as the reviews said."
2,The Legend is Over-rated,"Perhaps you've heard about how great FMW is. Perhaps you've heard how they ""invented"" hardcore wrestling. That may be so, but this tape doesn't prove it at all. Why? Let me count the ways.1)It has Horace freaking Hogan on it. In not one but two matches. Sure, it's better than his WCW work, but that's saying very little.2)The announcers are annoying. They can't convey any emotion, and their idea of insight is to rattle off the names of some old school wrestlers. Ole Anderson wasn't the only or first wrestler to work on one body part, so why do they keep on bringing him up? And their jokes are lame.3)The ultra-hardcore Death Match with Mr. Pogo is a lights out match. Meaning you can't see what's going on. Dumb dumb dumb.There is some good stuff on this tape. The work of Hayabusa is amazing. And the women's stuff is a hundred times better than their American counterparts. But really, if you can look around on the internet you can find much better tapes than this."
3,"Good, but could have been better","I liked this DVD alot, but I hated how some of the matches were clipped. Most it did not bother me, but the Kanemura/Tanaka match was one I REALLY wanted to see. Instead I got a 5 minutes of clips. It looked good too. I LOVED the Gladiator/Hayabusa match (shown in Full) as well as the Gladiator/Ooya vs Hayabusa, and ??. It was full too. The other DVD was much better. I hope all the matches are unedited next time. It was cool how they translated the speech!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","This is a good DVD to get if you're interested in seeing some good FMW action, but if you already have a bunch of their tapes you're not really missing anything. Some of the wrestlers included on this DVD are Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka, Super Leather (Leatherface), Mike Awesome (The Gladiator), Matsunaga (who gets set on fire in one match, very cool!) etc. Their are a total of 9 matches on this DVD including the bonus match found in the ""extras"" section of the main menu. Two of the matches unfortuntely are women's matches which I just can't get entertained watching. Instead of having the women's matches, they should have put in a few matches with Onita who is absent from this DVD which doesn't make much sense to me. The english commentary on this can also get very annoying, the announcers try to act all cool and say some really stupid jokes. Anyway, pick this up if you're in the mood for some pretty good hardcore action as well as some classic high-flying action."
2,Not Very Good.,"Some of the ECW tapes are much more exciting and more brutal. This tape is a little more brutal than WWF, but not as exciting as ECW. I have heard some good reports about FMW, but this tape isn't one of the better ones. No Cactus Jack in this one."
1,Chpped Enamel,After only two uses the enamel chipped. There is a significant chip near the bottom on the side of the pot.
5,"Attractive, lightweight, easy to use","I love Le Creuset pieces but some are so heavy they are a bit of a pain to work with. This stock pot is lightweight, consistent in appearance with other Le Creuset items, and easy to work with. Its shape is right for stock and it cleans up easily in the dishwasher. The inside is not a non-stick surface per se (i.e. not like Teflon or the like) but is very smooth and thus food tends not to adhere. Great price for a quality Le Creuset item. You do need to remember that b/c this is a stock pot, not a heavy-bottomed pot, if you heat spaghetti sauce or something else prone to burning you will want low heat (or to use another pot)."
3,Product is made in China,"I was not happy to learn that this is a product made in China, not France. Also the enamel is scratched near the handle."
2,Beware,"This is not made in France -- most of the Le Creuset line is from a centuries-old factory in France; this pot is not. When I saw where it was made, I returned it. Buyer beware."
4,4465612,"justo el artículo, trabaja adecuadamente, me ha gustado que es bastante comodo de precio con respecto los artículos de la marca, en casos como estos es bueno tener tantas opciones para adquirir productos"
5,Reliving his childhood,"I bought this set for my husband, he used to watch this show ehan he was just a kid. For a trip down memory lane these showa are perfect."
5,Very glad they reissued this program.,"Years ago, this program was either rare to come by or expensive to acquire. Thanks to the re-release & compilations of the program it is now easily available. I wanted it for Christmas this year, had it on my wish list, & thanks to my lovely sister [& in-law], will be able to enjoy the program. I loved this program as a kid but never had the chance to watch the entire series in order. IMO this is one of the best cartoon series [including the 1st] ever produced that was entertaining and taught us children morals, and as I was reminded last night: ""how to tread water""! :)"
4,A Little More Corn-ball Than I Remember,"This series held up to the test of remembered childhood...but not as well as I would have liked. I guess I was recalling the era of the animated movie when I decided to buy this, not so much the first few episodes...where Snake Eyes actually joins a chorus line and break dances. I kid you not."
4,WORD SALAD by any other name...,"Fischer Z's first album with two bonus track from later LP's. A strange mix but a welcome one for long time fans [like me] who never got Word Salad on CD when it was available. This is very typical of the early Fischer Z sound as found on their first 3 albums. For me it is better than the follow-up, Going Deaf For A Living, but not quite as good as Red Skies Over Paradise, my favourite Fischer Z offering. If you loved Marleise or So Long you'll find plenty to enjoy on this disc."
4,Carpenter's best score.,"I agree with the enthusiasm of the other reviewers here, and I think that this is EASILY Carpenter's best score. I normally don't even like synth music, but this creepy blend of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream at their most dark and moody sticks with you long after the (ridiculous, unfortunately) movie is over.Caveat emptor: It's a really good OST, but it's not worth 60 or 70 bucks (esp. for one that's not even in mint condition, like the one that's for sale at the time I'm writing this). Don't allow yourself to be gouged by some...uh...let's just say, ""opportunist,"" offering this for some exorbitant price on the Marketplace."
5,Excellent,This soundtrack has a completely different sound and feel than the other Halloween soundtracks and it should since Mr. Myers was not in the 3rd chapter. All the tracks have their own eerie sound which fits the movie perfectly. Unfortunately this soundtrack has been out of print for a long time and is extremely difficult to find even on eBay.
5,excellent overview of Paracelsus and his medical philosophy,"Paracelsus's personality and medical philosophy are well described by Hall. The book is very readable and entertaining. Paracelsus was a character, but also considered one of the early real holistic physicians. We are still able to learn from him today. He seemed to appreciate that combining traditional and non-traditional medicine together is the best medicine. Body/mind/spirit the Paracelsus way."
3,"Short, easy read","This 'book' actually looks more like something someone cranked out at home on a homemade press....it's very cheap in appearance. That said, it was an interesting read about one of the world's most famous early physicians. You can easily read it in a day. For someone who really wants a more in-depth and intellectual look ath Paracelsus I would recommend a better quality book. If you just want an easy reader this is it."
2,Poor quality,"The glasses that I received are defective, the rim on one of these is twisted and thin on one side, and two other glasses look rippled. The company that produces these must not perform quality inspections. I will be returning these glasses!"
4,"amazing music, but...","""Amazing"" doesn't begin to describe the singing on this CD. After all, it's Oum Kalthoum! BUT, the liner notes leave much to be desired. While the booklet does include rare photographs and notable quotes & accolades, there is not a single write-up about the songs themselves -- not even a rough translation of the titles! Oum Kalthoum's voice transcends language and touches the heart, but even so a CD set like this should include information about the poetry that she is singing."
1,Junk,"The plastic buffing disc broke off very suddenly during use and caused the large hex mounting bolt underneath to drive straight into the side of my vehicle, scratching the paint down to the metal before I could pull it away. This $25 buffer is going to cost me a few hundred dollars in repairs. Interdynamics no longer appears to list buffers on their website, so perhaps buffers weren't their thing."
2,Gift for my husband,"Husband really looked forward to using this. Made swirl marks on his car, actually did better doing it by hand."
3,okay,"I would not consider this book as one of Dickens best. It was a fast read, so that was nice. I wasn't as impressed with this as other Dickens novels."
5,Pictorial history of the WWII GI,"I had to say I loved the view into history that this book gave me. I also happen to be into the equipemnt of the G.I. This is THE book for that. It has over a 100 pictures that show what Patton's GIs really looked like during their epic campaign across Europe. The author is very good at pointing out details in uniforms and equipment on every picture. From types of boots and undergarmnents, he has a great eye. This book will stay in my library."
5,Who are you?,"Boy! This is indeed a strange book and if you don't know anything about pure Advaita just move on to Ramesh Balsekar or something. This is a sort of operating manual for folks at the end of the Advaitic rainbow. At this point you know who you are and you're sure about it and there's a knowing it's time to drop out of the play. This book is a collection of brief dialogues of ""people"" ready and willing to return home. If you like Stephen Wolinsky, Tony Parsons, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Bob Adamson, you'll see this is the absolute bare bones of Advaitic teaching, all fluff is totally and radically removed. This is kind of like meeting Joe Friday from the Dragnet TV series....just the facts Maam."
5,Don't Believe It?,"I did not believe the author's premise until reading his book. He covers the origins of many pagan religions, and then applies it to the medieval church. a few assumptions, but still an interesting book."
5,Religious Systems are united,"A true biblical perspective proving the bible is true.....if you can stand the truth, read this book. False religious systems are all united together."
2,way too much assumption..,"i could only read an hour of this. Read, 'a woman rides the beast' it's much better and covers the same ground."
1,This was not a book...it was a paper.,What a disappointment! This was not a real book -- it was someone's Bible College Book Report.
1,Great For The Unwashed Masses,I recommend this book to all uneducated bigots and holy rollers everywhere.This book has been de bunked over and over and yet remains a wonderful collection of fables and out right lies for bigots everywhere...The book also slams all traditions of the mainline Protestant churches....Warning please don't read if you posess even a rudimentary brain..For the Gullible out there only.
3,Over all a good read,"Over all a good read, but there are some issues with the connections made between Babylon and America. There are a number of things that make us like Babylon, yet there are a number of differences. America may no longer be blessed of God, but I still don't agree with his connection."
5,Revelational,"This book is a must have for those searching for truths. Explains SO much!The author's english is a little off at times, but it's easy enough to figure out what he's trying to convey.Definitely explains why the Catholic church is like it is.At the very least, the information on symbols and idols is worth it.You should find yourself at a loss for words MANY times throughout this book!There are a few points that I don't necessarily agree with overall but, this book proves to be a priceless addition to some of the research I have already done concerning this issue.... and THEN some!"
4,robi,"I am still reading the book along with a few others, but I it is all that I expected. Very good reading so far."
5,Satan's Deception,"It is amazing that I could be so blinded and deceived until the truth is presented to me. Although this book was difficult to read, I couldn't put it down. I immediately felt compelled to share with my Catholic friends and family what I had discovered. The information could be life shaking for a Catholic, and life changing if they were opened to the truth."
1,Hislop's sloppy scholarship,"Back in my much more ignorant and naive anti-Catholic days, I lapped up stuff like this. I read in amazement how the Catholic faith is really just rehashed ancient paganism! Only the truth is, it ISN'T. A very good website debunking his absurd hypothesis is [...]. An honest evaluation of the facts clearly reveals that Hislop's eagerness to condemn Catholicism resulted in some very poor and dishonest ""scholarship"". A big thumbs down."
4,The Twin Babaloyns,It is useful to see throughout history Man has defied GOD in making his own version of HIS WORD! The Catholics are just the most popular becase most of them are not required to read GOD's word just worship the pope and Mary the mother of Christ who did not realize all along who her?HIS son is.
5,Thank God for the Truth!,"This book should be read by all!!! It challenges the very existance of all that we have come to know as truth, i.e. Christmas, Easter, Catholicism and much more...I was aware of some of the idolatrous days that we celebrate, however, upon reading this book I have come to learn that it is deeper than that we know! It is interesting to me that intelligent people are the most caught up into societies standard religion and practices of ""Catholicism"", even though they are not all professing Catholics. It's amazing that we can challenge so many day to day issues and fail to see what is right before us...If you love the Lord, be willing and obedient to go with this author into the deeper depths of God's word. This book was termed as being a difficult read. It was, to a small degree. I attribute the difficulty to the time inwhich it was written. Never the less it is worth the challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!!!"
2,Pass on this one.,Very small print with bad print quality. The transcriptionsseem to be good but it doesn't matter if parts are unreadable.
5,A Must-Read for all those looking to live a better life.,This is a beautiful and eye-opening book. Even life-changing. It is a shame that these revelations granted to Saint Gertrude 700 years are little known today. I am buying another copy for my Mother right now. And I only send my Mother the best.
5,Beautiful,"I love St. Gertrude...and this is a wonderful book for anyone wanting to learn more about Purgatory...I am called to pray for these holy souls...I highly recomend this book to anyone who loves to read about the saints, as i do, and yearn to know more about Purgatory and the Holy souls who have been there, and will be going...This is a book that is hard to put down...This is a great read...The Amazing Secret of the Souls in Purgatory: An Interview with Maria Simma"
4,Excellent and thorough,"This must be the definitive history of voting in America. I hold back from giving it five stars because it was a little more than what I was looking for, but this is as thorough as I have ever come across. Also, I love charts and graphs, and he has a great array of tables at the end. Interesting tidbit was the role war played throughout American history in expanding the right to vote. Also, though we all know how the right to vote gradually expanded, but what many of us didn't realize was how the right to vote actually shrunk at various points in American history. That is, some people who had the right to vote had it taken away at various moments in American history. When all is said and done, this is a great book."
4,Almost five stars -- BEWARE!,"First the plus -- The picture quality is superb. No doubt about it. There are extras and while they are nothing special, they are worth the price of admission.Second the negative -- The final season was shot in color and this set contains only the first half of the final season. Why they never released the entire season I do not know.Solution? There is a 75th Anniversary box set being released containing the entire first two seasons of the series and with luck, they will continue in chronological order and release the rest -- and probably these episodes as well."
5,Amazing!!!,I love this DVD set!! The color is amazing. The episodes are so much fun to see now in this amazing vivid clarity.
3,"Great looking transfers, but. . . . . .","I am amazed that none of the early reviewers mentioned that the episodes are not the complete ones. The color transfers look great, but what a huge disappointment to discover that each episode runs only about 22 minutes, including the credits. Oh, yes, the opening segment is not the original one either. Rhino gets five stars for fantastic color and clarity, but it loses two stars for presenting incomplete episodes."
4,Childhood Story,"I'm not sure if this is the book I remember since there isn't a synopsis, but the book I remember while I was in first grade or so (about 30 years ago) was about an aunt or a nanny bringing a little girl to school and always telling her to Hurry, Hurry. Finally she steps into some sort of tar or goo and has to take very slow steps and forces the aunt/nanny to slow down and enjoy the journey. For some reason this book has always stuck in my mind in this hurry, hurry world we live in. Thought it might be food for thought for my children."
4,Perfect for storage of small collectables,I purchased these containers to store several items. They are strong but not brittle. The lid works nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to store something and keep it in good shape.
5,American Made,"Made in America, that's why I purchased this product. It's exactly what I expected and perfect for what I plan to use it for. Dimensions are spot on."
4,Very good FID bench,"With so much versatility in positioning (the seat is adjustable, the back is adjustable, the entire thing moves forward or back) it suits any exercise for users of any size. The attachment sleeve is very useful of course - only if you buy those Powertec attachments, which are quite good (bought several of those too). My ONLY complaint is that it seems slightly wobbly on my carpeted floor. Probably due to the carpeting, but since it's anchored to my power rack, it doesn't really matter. Once setup for an exercise, it doesn't wobble and feels pretty stable. So, four stars for sheer depth of functionality."
5,Great Color Gel!,Perfect for my front 150W Par38 cans to light local rock bands! Bastard Amber is supposed to be the best for skin tones!
2,MICROSCOPIC LIFE,"EXCELLENT PHOTOS AND DIAGRAMS, BUT FOR WHAT I NEEDED, I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE QUITE ELEMENTARY, SUITABLE FOR CLASSROOM USE FOR YOUNGER STUDENTS. I WAS DISASSPOINTED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T FIT MY NEEDS AT ALL."
4,One of Tintin's best albums,"One of the best Tintin books, done in the mid 50s, right after the two moon books, had the Bordurians and the Syldavians going after the latest invention of Calculus, a weapon capable of destroying faraway cities through sound waves. This is the closest Tintin book to a (nifty) espionage novel, submerged in a cold war atmosphere you don't see anywhere else in the series. It shows Herge's huge improvement as a storyteller, as the book starts mysteriously and suspensefully and slowly gives up its secrets. Borduria (where the action takes place in the last third of the book) is shown as the stereotypical country behind the iron curtain (with dictator Kurvy Tasch as an obvious stand in for Stalin). One quibble: isn't ungrateful on the part of the Syldavians to briefly kidnap Calculus, as he was so crucial on bringing them to the moon?. Another quibble is that perhaps the most obnoxious of all the characters in the Tintin series, Jolyon Wagg, is introduced here."
3,Ikki Tousen: The Complete Series S.A.V.E.,Great story line enjoyed characters. Not too short. I like for my animies to be at least 300 minutes or more. It has just enough action to keep you interested.
1,Fan service,"Believe me, i watched this anime. I watched it because i received it as a gift from my members in my anime club. Now I can take fan service, and sometimes shows with fan service in them turn out to be pretty good. I'm defiantly not a prude and have a open mind about anything. But this anime sucked so much, it was basically an excuse to show boobs, boobs and OH panties. .-. Ugh, and the story isn't that wonderful, to be honest I'd rather watch a concert recital of horrible playing then this. :O don't get this box set if your looking for a story driven anime with heart, and fan service. Get this, is your INTO FAN SERVICE and panty shots. xD"
5,Funny cartoon series for those with sense of Humor(?),"Curiosity caused me to check this out. Cartoons have come a long was since Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck! Not for the humorless. Watch with cold beer/coke and a bag of chips and no girls around unless they have a really good sense of humor and realize that ""girls can fight dirty"", so you better watch out."
2,I loved you Kanu!!! but this show is ZZZzzzZZZ,"The show is so lame....oh god whyI only know the show becuase the Kanu (blu hair girl in it) is so populer and I see her character everywhere.other then that the story is school's fighting, it's boringit's good if you arel ike 13-14 I guess,the animation is goodthe female characters are some of the hottest around.very sexy, the show itselfh as no nudity but the extra's have them.but it's 2 silly and cute to be erotic or anything really.it's for 12 year olds kids probebly for girlsit's boring and lame really."
3,You might like it if you buy anime for underdressed girls.,"The story is okay, but I think the animator was a pervert. Many times the main character -- Stupid girl (because I cannot recall her name only that she is called stupid girl a lot), is constantly having her clothes ripped off or kicking so high her panties are showing --A LOT! While many of claimed the story is a romance, it appears to be more of a rip-off between the Karate kid and some sorta sci-fi film (The latter is why I continued to watch this set.)Overall, I do not recommend this set for younger viewers. It appears to be just a step or two under Hentai."
5,Ikki Tousen Rocks!,"It's loosely based on an ancient story, has great action and more fanservice than Bill Clinton could take. Definitely for mature audiences! ^^"
2,"Series is okay, title is misleading","First off ""complete series"" what a load of bull. This DVD only contains the first season. Now that I got that outta the way, lets get on to my review. Ikki Tousen is about a very dumb girl, that really loves a good street fight. I guess she's supposed to be the reincarnation of some great warrior of legend and her destiny is to kick everyones ass. I'll admit I'm being a bit vague, but this series just isn't very deep. Get it if you love fan service and female street fighting. Bottom line I give the series 3 stars, but had to deduct one star because it was It was labed as the complete series."
2,Plenty of panties and nude girls...Just no likable story,"Watching this video was like being shuffed threw the doors on black fridays at walmart, not enough plot not enough charector developement. Just not beliveable enough for the premiss of the story or people."
4,Lots of great babes and action.,"7 schools are at war with each other. These schools have male and female fighters that battle for supremacy. Hakufu Sonsaku is new in town. Her cousin and herself are fighting to protect their friends and keep their school on top. More importantly they fight to make their own destiny.This anime is a lot of fun. It has great action, comedy, and some really great characters. It's more focused on chicks fighting and getting it on than the actual story. The plot is a bit thin and kinda out there, but interesting. You can easily get into the characters, and want them to be okay in the end. I guess that is what makes an anime good. Ikki Tousen is a very entertaining anime to watch, but as I said it's main purpose is fan service."
3,"Ok, But Not As Good As Some","I made it thru watching this anime set and was a bit disappointed. I'm the kind of person that if I'm going to like it, I know it by the first or second disk. After the first one on this series, I just didn't find myself getting into the series, and that was the way it went for the remainder of the set. I'm not saying it's a bad series, it just didn't grab me. Others might disagree."
4,Read the other reviews,I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
2,Adult content for Teens?,The story is bad. The voices are horrible.This series is directed at teen males by featuring a huge amount of violence combined with sexual content toned down enough to avoid a Mature rating.
4,Precious Moments,I get these for my Granddaughters and sometimes it's hard to get at the local shops. Ordering from here is fast and very convienient. I have never had a problem ordering and receiving merchandise from Amazon.com and the prices are right.
4,Tradition,"I have been buying one birthday train figurine a year for my niece since she was born 13 years ago. They are cute and she always looks forward to seeing what the latest one is. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is, I think it is too expensive. But it sure is cute, especially when in line with the other birthday train pieces."
1,HUGE Disappointment!!,"Again, as with another ""Moods"" CD, I did not listen first...I thought I wouldn't have to given that all the songs were ones I knew. However, I don't recall seeing anywhere on the description that the original artists weren't the ones singing these songs. Although I realized what was going on when the first bars played of Hotel California, I couldn't believe my ears.Each song on the CD's are a poor rendition of the originals. I can only suggest that you don't waste any money on this purchase."
3,takes from the Original,Since this is a sequel's CD I do think it is a very well orginized Cd and well put together. ALthough we all have heard the theme song of Halloween. It still doesn't get old through 4 movies
4,A fine effort,"With the Halloween 4 score, Alan Howarth was somewhat freed from the contraints of the John Carpenter compositions. The result is that there are less elements of the original themes and scores. Beyond that the soundtrack plays to Howarth's strengths more than weaknesses. The score is very full in it's synthetic symphonic nature. While it doesn't have the themes and motifs found in the compositions of Carpenter, Howarth kept the tension up in this score and used his skills as a studio master, coupled with his experience with the genre to complete a fine effort in the series."
5,GREAT CD!,This soundtrack is really good. All the songs are great.Halloween 4 - The Return - GoodJamies Nightmare - Really GoodGarage - GoodBe Back by 9:30 - GoodReturn of the shape - EXELLENT!Schoolhouse - EXELLENTPower Company - GoodPolice Station - GoodDownstairs alone - Really GoodMyers Finale - EXELLENTHalloween 4 Reprise - GoodOverall a must buy for everybody.
5,A pop classic,"While the excellent single ""Baker Street"" is the best known song from Gerry Rafferty's ace solo album, ""City to City,"" there are plenty of other great songs here worthy of the man who composed ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" as part of the band Stealer's Wheel. Rafferty shows himself to be a first rate songwriter, composing such fine gems as ""Stealin' Time,"" ""The Ark"" and the masterful ""Whatever's Written in Your Heart,"" which features him and his backup singers crooning with little backing instrumentation. Overall, this is one of the best rock albums from the late 1970s."
3,"OK - well, I wasn't missing all that much . . .","Like many who grew up in the late 70s and early 80s, I have fond memories of ""Baker Street."" I used to have found memories of ""Right Down the Line"" as well, but after listening to it a few times, the lyrics are just a little too blunt to be compelling. I finally broke down and got the album to see if Rafferty held up on a larger scale project. Some of the other songs are pretty decent, but in general the energy and emotion just aren't there in sufficient qualities. I love ""polished"" music, whether Bryan Ferry or Aimee Mann or any number of ""pop"" artists not afraid of putting a sheen on their work. Rafferty just doesn't seem to be in their league. Still, Baker Street's still a great moment in pop history . . ."
5,A Must Have!,"""City to City"" has always been one of my favorite albums of the 70's. ""Baker Street"" was a huge a.m. radio hit and has recently made a comeback through classic rock radio and its appearance on the ""Good Will Hunting"" soundtrack. As well as being covered by the Foo Fighters last year. The biggest attractions of the album are the diversity of the tracks and the unmistakable voice of Gerry himself. ""Mattie's Rag"" is a salute to old ragtime music and ""Whatever's written in your heart"" is a true pure love song. There's also some steel guitar mixed throughout just for good measure. As a whole the album is a great rock statement. ""Right Down The Line"" was also a hit that you may have forgotten about. ""City To City"" also has a very clean sound to it, the recording is exceptional. There's not too many albums you can say that you like every song, but ""City to City"" delivers."
2,180 Gram Vinyl 2010 Remaster Review,"I just wanted to let everyone know that there is a problem with this vinyl copy. Most of the LP sounds okay, but starting with the second track on side two, ""Whatever's Written In Your Heart"", there is a lot of crackle in the left channel. It's also present in tracks 3, 4 and 5. It completely ruins the listening experience."
5,Rafferty is Sublime...,"This wonderful album is one that you can sit and listen to over and over. It is good from beginning to end. The vocals are effortless, beautiful and almost not of this world. What a rare talent! The instrumentals are precise and clean and perfectly compliment Rafferty's phenomenal voice. The ""flow"" of this album is really outstanding too. Each song melts into the next with utter grace. The songs are each very unique, with meaningful, heartfelt lyrics. I have to say that this is simply one of the best albums I've ever heard. It is without flaw!"
5,One of the best rock albums ever.,"This is the album I can listen to over and over. As a matter of fact, I've been listening to it since it came out many years ago. The music is still great and carries me away!"
3,A response to all the rave reviews,"Let me start by saying that ""Baker Street"" and ""Right Down the Line"" are brilliant, extraordinary songs. But the rest of the City to City album is decidedly ordinary. Don't get me wrong, a few of the album tracks, like ""Stealin' Time"" and ""Home and Dry"", are decent. But there is a lot of filler, and this is not even close to a five star album."
3,Good but less so without Baker Street,"A disclaimer to anyone who likes AOR type rock and roll: I may not be the best one to offer a critique on this release. My musical tastes are a bit harder (Deep Purple, Dio era Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden), so take it for what it's worth. I remember immediately liking ""Baker Street"" when I first heard it in 1978. I bought the CD more than 10 years later. Other tracks are listenable such as the title track , ""Stealin' Time"", and ""High and Dry"" but nothing that stands out for me other than ""Baker Street"". On the other hand, Cat Stevens' Greatest Hits..."
2,Just buy the two tunes,"If you don't have ""Baker Street"" and ""Right Down The Line,"" just spent the $1.98 for those two. The rest is forgettable."
5,excellent,very good albumall the songs are good.i'll recommand very much this albumone of my favorite CDsuper
2,"I'm sorry, this is not good enough...","My main problem with the book is the quality of the pictures. I read in another review, that the picture quality was great, but it isn't. Instead of doing the pictures for the book, by scanning the original 35-millimeter prints, as they should have done, for a good result, it looks like they've used video-images. yes, that's right: Video. There are those pink and light-green distortions at the edge of white areas. Pixelation happening all over the place. No clear, sharp edges. Very dissappointing. I love Mr. Romaneks work, and this book does not do his images justice, I'm sorry."
2,Invest in Complete Impulse and Atlantic sets.....,"First off, I want to say that all of the recordings on here are beautiful. They all capture the pure genius and sheer beauty that is Coltrane, but it amazes me why they put this set together like this. Im giving it 2 stars....but dont be confused, the music is beautiful, its the set thats getting 2 stars. You Do Not Ever Ever Ever in Life Ever Seperate A Love Supreme! It is a suite, meant to be heard in its entirety. How could u leave out 2 movements? This is like one big sample set. They took pieces from all over the place and threw them on 4 cds. It isn't how the music is supposed to be heard. Pay the extra 40 or 50 bucks and buy the Classic Quartet Complete Impulse! recordings. It is a more complete and logical approach to the genius that is Coltrane. Then, buy the Complete Atlantic recordings. These two sets are the reason God put me on this earth."
3,"""The Construction"" makes it worth it","Truly one of Mr. Goldsmith's most uplifting themes is ""The Construction"" from Explorers. It is a fabulous piece of music that expresses the inspiration, passion and the process of a creation of something important. I listen to this track whenever I'm writing and I lose myself in my work. It's classical string arrangement reverberates throughout, giving you a feeling of power.It belongs up there with Maurice Jarre's ""Building the Barn"" in Witness.The rest of the soundtrack works with the film but rarely retains the flourish of ""The Construction."" But in my humble opinion, you must have this track, and thus, get the CD."
3,"good, but no masterpiece at all","I know this is a rare score. When i finally got it, it dissapointed me a bit. There is nothing here that we didn't already hear in other Goldsmith scores. No truly heroic piece, lots of terrible eighties synthsounds. apart from nice moments of melody, there is to little to enjoy here. Why the horrific blues in the last track? Goldsmith has done better, it is not bad, but rather average. Too short though too."
1,Suprisingly Dull,While doing research for a project on Radio City Music Hall I kept coming across critic's review of Peter Allen shows at Radio City. They raved about his talent and energy of the shows. Surprised with my lack of knowledge on the performer I purchased this cd. None of the music on this cd is worthy of praise and shows Allen to be a campy overrated hack.
3,Some magic...but some overly sweet!,"I was first introduced to Peter Allen via the brilliant movie ""Dominik and Eugene"" and the song on offer was ""I go to Rio"". The song was so good that the movie producers put it in twice!. This led me to purchasing ""the best of"" collection which overall is good but for me nothing quite hits the dizzy greatest of ""I go to Rio"". Many songs are smooth/gentle/romantic (Don't cry out loud, I honestly love you), jazzy/clowny (Just a Gigolo, Everything old) or sweet and fast-moving (""The more I see you"" ""I go to Rio"", 'Bi-coastal).Overall, the album shows a very talented musician and most of the songs will sound very familiar (e.g. ""the more I see you"" was a recent beer comercial).Me?....I am going to buy the live album with the live version of ""Rio""...its THAT good!"
4,Great engaging game,"I have only played the single player missions for about an hour, but I'm already drawn into the world of Devastation. It is immersive with the physics and graphical elements. Who knew that going through an abandoned building would be so cool, until you could see the fires burning and chemical showers going off throughout the place.What's really amazing is that this all ran on my old ATI Rage 128 pretty nicely. I can't wait to see what it looks like on my ATI Radeon 9700.The only downfall is that the gunfights were a little too easy, so far. When all you have to worry about is strafing and shooting at each easy target, it starts to get boring. I think some more heavy weapons should be added like the Grenade Launcher and RPG7 from SOF2. Those are a little harder to dodge."
3,"boring , redundant shooter","some may be okay with this one, i couldn't get it to work on windows 7 , had to use my xp laptop and the game is okay but just became redundant and i found myself not wanting to finish it, some parts toward the end of the game were just a bear to get through and just left me wanting to go to a different game.......still hardcore gamers may still like this one and if you pick it up for a few bucks it may not be a loss"
2,Multiplayer thingers...,"There seem to be so many bugs in multiplayer, random items floating in the air, strips of ammo floating in the air, randomly moving an object that is no where near you, shooting a gun even though nothing is coming out (such as, you'll have reloaded your gun and then suddenly you can't shoot it anymore), let's see...team switches/scores are occasionally screwed up, sounds are poor, BUT, Graphics are pretty nice due to UT2, and it's an overall fun game even with so many bugs. However, I have noticed this game seems like 3 other games: Red Faction (the Antique Machine Gun, nOOb cannon, a real lamer weapon, as well as a lot of bugs, RF had so many bugs it isn't funny) Red Faction 2 (the style of gameplay) and Counter-Strike (the purchasing menu)...and one thing I don't like about it is the arrogant people that play it, and the way the game shows how somebody killed somebody else...still fun though :)"
1,Low Budget,"This game is terrible. The sound is bad, the character models are graphically 5 years out of date, and the voice acting is bad even for a video game! Other than the bad models, the rest of the graphics are very nice (thanks to the Unreal 2 engine)but this doesn't save an otherwise sorry game."
2,Overpriced and Buggy,"This game is very buggy. I bought it and it is slow and the physics, while cool are pretty unrealistic. This should have been a budget title - it is not worth the $$$."
2,Devastation is a Devastation,"Devastation is your basic run of the mill fps... the graphic are good but could be a bit more polished. and the game could get a decent score but the ai has many problems. many. the enemy ai is insulting the ai will do dumb thing like... wait for you to reload behind a corner...Guard corners...and my favorite walk right into you crosshairs. and you have team mebers to ""help you"" the game htat could be a decent run and gun now is an escort mission. the ai the enemy are grace with is also in your teammates. if your teamate dies you have to do the mission over again and you do that alot because your team is sucidel. save your money and buy another fps like unreal"
3,A pretty fun game under the surcomstances,"You get to pick up new weapons, use a mouse (the blows up), use guns (up to 50) and you get to blast the heck out of the people. The plot, trying to achieve something. Its actually quite fun, I like to blast them strait to hell with my laser gun. A GREAT GAME UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. This game isn't suitable for children under 13"
1,"GREAT CONCEPT, TERRIBLE EXECUTION","First of all, forget what anyone else says. This is a terrible game. The enemies and squadmates are total idiots! The graphics look terrible."
2,made in Taiwan??,"Gee, I love their products made in France, but the stockpot is made in Taiwan and has all of the qualities of cookware that Taiwan is known for manufacturing. A fairly nice pot, true, but much better can be aquired for the money."
1,"Extremely poor quality, not really Le Creuset","This is another product that had the name brand, but not quality. First, it is not the normal cast iron Le Creuset products. It is made of a thin layer of steel, with some enamel like paint on it. It does not heat up evenly, and food burns and sticks to the bottom. Second month of using it, the enamel paint start to chip off the bottom. I did not use any abrasive cleaning products, and always used wood or nylon utensils. Contacted the manufacturer about warranty, and never heard back from them.I bought it for $40 when it was on sale. Definately not worth even that, let alone the normal price."
3,Burns thick sauces,"I probably should not have used this pot for making jam, but I did. Beware. At first, I thought that Le Creuset's enamel finish would be sufficient to withstand the temperature of a blueberry jam that was going to be carefully watched and stirred. I never used more than medium high heat -which the pot should have withstood-. However, although the jam turned out fine, the pot's bottom became scorched and NOTHING would take off the burned mix off. I tried every method (vinegar, baking soda, etc.). After trying everything and reviewing online posts, I asked my husband to power wash the pot. That worked. From now on, I would only use it for light soups (no lentils probably) and stock. However, for a lower price, I can get a pot that does the same work. That said, I bought a Le Creuset French Oven that I adore and do use for making jams. I would not trade this one fore anything else."
1,Do not buy without prior inspection,"There's no way I would buy one of these online.If you aren't familiar with the colours, the photos will throw you off. The ""cobalt"" comes across as a very deep and rich blue in a lot of online photos, while in reality it is dull and somewhat purplish. Similarly, the red is also much deeper and punchy in photos. In contrast, the ""caribbean"" aquamarine and ""kiwi"" green are much more saturated in real life.The real problem, however, comes with the enamel. I just bought one from a Le Creuset store, and the enamel is terrible, with multiple black spots where the enamel didn't fully adhere. By multiple, I mean that there are about a couple dozen spots on the lid and main pot. Granted, the spots are small and look like coffee grounds, but you probably don't want to be faced with the hassle of sending your pot back. For these non-French stockpots (mine is made in Thailand), at least, I would recommend buying in person and inspecting carefully."
2,Flawed enamel exterior,Just received this stock pot. Very disappointed in the quality. The exterior enamal has open holes where the enamel is not complete. Appears as though air bubble ruptured during the enamaling process and left the open holes. This is especially prominent under the handles. I will not purchase any more of these. Will stick with Calphalon and All Clad from now on.
1,"Nice, BUT buy somewhere else","I ordered this one at Amazon last week, I got on monday but it was defective product or second quality (the handdles are repainting you can see it clearly). So I asked for a replacement, which was sent immediately, however the second one was worse, one of the handdle has large chip. So, I called amazon again, but this time they told me they can't replace item twice. Now, I got no stock pot and I have to wait 10 days to two weeks to get my money back."
3,"Pretty pot, but not a great perfomer","There are a few things I like about this pot. You can get it in attractive colors to match you Le Creuset cookware. It lighter and easier to lift, and also cheaper than my ""good"" Le Creuset cast iron cookware. It is good for boiling pasta. It is not good for cooking anything that might stick or scorch! I am not a bad cook, but I keep having things stick in the bottom of this pan, which also wore quickly in spite of using gentle stirring implements. It is simply not a high-performance pan, but for just boiling things in water, it comes in handy, and you don't have to be embarrassed if you leave it sitting out, since it's pretty."
2,Beautiful but not durable,"I purchased this pot for myself as a Christmas gift. I read and followed the directions for use and care, always hand-washed the pot, and I never dropped it or banged it into anything.With normal use and special care, the pot started to get chips in the enamel at the base after about three months. I used it maybe twice a week.After six months, the chips extended to the inside of the pot and it is now unusable.This is a very poorly-made product and is not up to the usual Le Creuset high quality standards despite its high price."
2,I Expected Better from This Company,"The price was great and I was already familiar with the quality of this company's merchandise, having used some of their pots and pans for years since marriage. When the stockpot arrived, it was just so pretty and I couldn't wait to use it. The first time was great. However, this time I was putting together a black bean soup and as I scraped the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, I became aware something had happened. A day or so later, as I took all the soup out to transfer to a bowl, there on the bottom of this pan was all the enamel coming off in big pieces. I couldn't believe it! It is ruined and I will never be able to use it again. It's just so pretty and the perfect size, so it's a big disappointment. I won't buy LeCreuset again."
1,Beautiful pot - just don't cook with it!,"I own many Le Creuset pots (cast iron) and think that they are the best to cook with - even heat and long lasting. This is not of the same quality and should not bear the Le Creuset name. It is a cheap pot with obvious surface flaws, after ONE use the enamel chipped in three places - two inside and one outside. I wasn't exactly trying to put the pot through it's paces, just boiling water (at a medium heat per the instructions).The color is quite nice, and if you just want a pretty pot sitting on your shelf it is quite economical. But, if you want to actually use it for cooking - do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
3,Bmg,"I love the size of the pot, but that's about it. Everything sticks to the bottom, no matter how low of a flame is under it. I've tried everything. It is very difficult to clean once anything sticks to it."
2,not too good,i would not buy another one. the lid doesn't fit tight and the bottom chipped easily. the first one i ordered was chipped when i opened the box
5,Awesome stockpot - make sure you read the directions!!,"Too many people have complained about this stockpot....the reason for many complaints is that people are not paying attention to the directions, and they're cooking foods that are not recommended for use in an enameled pot. It's a stockpot - meaning, soups or boiling pasta. It's not meant to cook heavy foods that will burn and scorch. I have several enameled pots, including the Le Creuset, and I love them all and they're in great shape - because I use them as intended."
1,Disappointed.,"These pots are terrible. I've had mine for over a year and it looks like i've owned it for twenty. Even though I've been careful to treat it gently, the paint chips and breaks off, leaving really unsightly spots on the exterior. The interior seems to have similar problems, chipping easily.I love the stone bakeware I have by Le Creuset, but after this purchase, I think I might look to other brands. Don't buy unless you never plan on using these pots."
4,Snow in August,"I strongly recommend the book Snow in August because two individuals from different religious backgrounds bond together to defeat a common enemy, racism. Through their continous contact, Michael and the rabbi's bong grow stronger surviving acts of racism as well as town beatings. Not only did their bond survive through harsh tests: their retaliation struck fear into other racists and those who oppose them. Those who read this book can learn the valuable lesson that true friendship and strong beliefs can overcome tough obstacles in life."
5,What a great read!,I loved this book! It pulled me in right at the beginning and held my interest the whole way through! I thought the ending was a little bizarre but the good guys won!
3,Miracles do happen if you believe.,"Snow In August transcends the racial barrier and focuses on Michael Devlin, an 11 year old Irish male who befriends Rabbi Judah Hirsch, a refugee from Prague. What transpires during this unlikely friendship is both heartwarming and compelling. Although they are from different cultures, they find a common bond in the all-American past time:baseball. During the friendship, Michael teaches the Rabbi English through baseball analogies. Subsequently, Michael learns Yiddish from the Rabbi. However, the story also includes gang violence which in a way tests their friendship. Michael's mother feels it is wrong to be an informer;whereas Rabbi Hirsch feels it is as wrong to keep silent about a crime, as it is to actually commit a crime. Inevitably, Michael discovers a way of resolving this issue through his belief in God. This was an interesting book which will make you reflect on your own belief system."
3,An unintentionally cynical message,"Not as good as Hamill's other work. Michael was a very believable character, the rabbi less so. But what was the author t h i n k i n g of with that ending? Thuggery, bigotry and brutality are an all-too-real part of the world. Are we to oppose them with nothing but fantasy? With a world in which the Golem walks, and the dead of the Holocaust rise? Surely Hamill can't mean to say: those things don't really happen, any more than it really snows in August. Yet isn't that exactly what he's saying? He is not a cynical man, yet his book carries a sad and cynical message. At best, I'd rather believe he's saying: this is how we wish life could be, too bad it's not."
2,Disappointing,"I was thoroughly enjoying the romp through the Brooklyn of my youth though somewhat skeptical of the boy, Michael, believing in all the superheroes stuff while seeming to be quite levelheaded about the reality around him. Then the ending made me wonder why I had wasted all that time reading the book. Michael's refusal to report the atrocities to the police also didn't ring true and the heavy handed racism didn't help any either. This could have been a very good book if the author either did it as straigh fantasy or straight reality. Mixing the two is a cop-out."
5,Correction- Swantek Comments,"Oops! Somehow (brain atrophication, I think) caused me to give the wrong e-mail address in my comments on Pete Hamill's ""Snow in August.""In the name of fairness, and in case anyone wants to chew my butt, below is the actual e-mail addresses for moi -- both at work and at home.John swantek"
5,A wonderful read,I picked up this book and could not put it down. Thisis the finest novel I have read in years.
4,A jew And A kid from IReland,This book was an excellent boook until the end. It was intresting to read about what happens to Micheal. The book was a pretty hard book to put down becuse you didn't know what would happen next. There were a lot intresting parts like when the rabbi and priest got together to clean of swastikas. The thing that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the endind it ruined the book for me i thought there was going to be a serious ending but no there were mud figures prancing around. So if you want to read a good on what an irish boy has to deal with in america read this book and skip the end.
4,A compassionate read that shows the goodness of human heart,"I thouroughly enjoyed the characters and the feel of the era that this book brought to life. A simpler time, perhaps, but not without injustices and racism that we still face today. Of course the baseball and introduction of Jackie Robinson as the first black ballplayer is symbolic of these truths. While I thought the ending was somewhat fantasy and different from the rest of the book, I would definately recommend Snow in August."
2,Didn't spark my interest!,"Though Hamill's ideas were interesting, the execution of his novel was too simpistic to be an effective story. I would love to see how another author would bring bring this novel's contents (i.e. the richness of the divergent Jewish and Catholic religions, the psychology of gang violence, the nostalgia of 1940's baseball, the mystery of the Kballah) more to life."
2,A wonderful classic story with a disappointing ending,"I would have given this book 5 stars + if it had maintained the promise of the first 3/4 of the book. I loved the little boy, the Rabbi, the mother. And the bad guys were easy to hate. It was a perfectly woven story, full of good characters, scenes, suspense, surprises, twists of fate. But I feel that the writer didn't know how to end this story and so resorted to a fantasy ending which was so unbelievable and unsatisfying. One reviewer could be right though-- it might well be a good ""allegory"" to expose young children to. It certainly points out good over evil."
2,Hamill's editor must have been asleep at the wheel.,"This book starts out so amazingly promising, the lackluster ending is a huge disappointment. As I read the first half of the book, I actually thought I was reading a new classic -- the kind of book that would be read in junior highs and high schools around the country for years to come. But Hamill loses it about 3/4 the way through. Suddenly, he shifts from a very realistic narrative to fantasy, without batting an eye. Now we've all made writing mistakes and taken inappropriate tangents in our prose. That's the process of writing. But most of the time, we re-read ourselves and/or get good advice from well-meaning friends: ""Oops! You slipped off course there."" WHERE WAS HAMILL'S EDITOR? This could have been such a great book, with an important lesson for every reader about racism. But with a fantasy ending, nothing carries any weight or teaches any lasting lessons. What a disappointment!"
2,"Nice start, no finish","A pleasant enough start to this novel carries you along for a good while. I was willing to overlook the hard to believe level of introspection and insight for a pre-teen boy in Brooklyn (or anywhere else, for that matter). I am pre-disposed to enjoy Brooklyn in the 50's because that's where and when I grew up. However, DON'T waste my time with a plot you didn't finish. This is not a novel, it's a fantasy. Very disappointing resolution to the conflict. Don't believe everything Imus says."
5,Snow in August is about character-building and healing.,"SNOW IN AUGUST is a moving story about a boy searching for values. In the midst of racial and religious prejudice, he discovers that the deepest of all values, a personal spirituality, is a powerful and healing force. What is more, this young boy discovers that this core of Spirit is the only thing upon which any of us can truly depend.If you like history, tales of growing up, and the mystic, you will be mesmerized by SNOW IN AUGUST"
5,Super Read,An enjoyable and sweet story. There are few storytellers as engaging and talented as Pete Hamill. This book harkens back to an earlier time where people of different backgrounds learned about their neighors' cultures without the forced and sanctimonious multiculturalism we see today. It reminded me of the stories that Colin Powell tells of learning to speak Yiddish in the South Bronx. The book also contains an interesting treatment of Jewish mysticism woven into the narrative. One of the best stories that I have read in awhile.
3,We did not enjoy this book half way through.......,"If you are someone that enjoys a coming of age book , read Snow in August . Michael is an Irish boy who befriends a rabbi and they teach each other the ways of their land. I enjoyed reading the book in the beginning, because it dealt with real life problems after the war. Then near the end of the book, super magical power is used and it confused me.I wish that the author had come up with an ending that I could relate too, and made me feel that there was a good conclusion to the problems that had arose. With the magical powers I feel that Michael did not make enough effort in the ending to feel that he has accomplished anything."
5,When The Morals Forget Their Morals,"Brilliantly written, Hamill present's an extroadinary talent by so carefully describing 1940s Brooklyn compared to 1930s Prague...An unlikely occurance of an Irish altar boy meeting a poor rabbi opens doors to all sorts of reactions from the parish...In the face of bigotry for the rabbi, and likewise for knowing to much about Mister G's brutal, discriminated assault, Michael must summon the Captain Marvel of the Jews, the Golem, who under the direction of the wizard (rabbi), is able to uproot the nearing ""Holocaust"" of Frankie and the Falcons..."
2,A disappointment!,"""Snow in August"" is a big disapointment. Main characters are not fully developed. The reader craves more information of their lives than provided by the book. Tertiary characters are interesting but fade out of the novel without reappearing.Several sequences seem out of place. The ending is unsatisfactory with respect to the plot and the literary device. The novel makes one wonder if was a joke. It was definitely not up to the standard one expects from the author."
1,What's to like about this book?,"It's overly sentimental, melodramatic, predictable, repetitve, and the ending is a world-class cop-out. This fantasy story reads like it was written for grade schoolers; that's the only target audience I could recommend this book to."
1,What a disappointment,"I am so glad to have Amazon.com as a way to vent my frustration over this book. I read it eagerly for the depiction of the interaction between a young Catholic boy growing up in Irish Brooklyn and the new Jewish immigrant saved from a horrific Europe. Unfortunately, what I found was a sentimental and largely uninformed view of Jewish life and a superficial set of characters who stood as icons for real people. Then, after slogging through the book with the hope that Hammil would at least address the hard question of good and evil in real life, he decides to fall back on a Deus Ex Machina to save him from the hard work of having his characters find their own way out. I can only say to Mr. Hammil what he seems to say to his readers: Phhhht!"
3,A good read but a disappointing ending.,I approached this book hesitantly as I have never been a big fan of Hammill's writings in the local newspapers. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was written and how much I enjoyed it. The book is the tale of post-war Brooklyn and the unlikely friendship between an Irish American boy and a Jewish rabbi. The friendship educates them both as does the parallel saga of Jackie Robinson. I was disappointed however by the ending. I won't give it away but to have a novel so firmly rooted in the gritty reality of the streets end in such a mystical fashion was lost on me.
3,not for realism freaks,"Despite all the wonderful parts of the book, the ending left me wondering if Hamill wants us to believe that running away from a problem or invoking a mystical superman is a solution. I need real world, not ""snow in August."""
2,What a let down.,"God, did I hate the ending of this book. At least with ""Forever"", which I loved, you are asked to suspend reality right from the get, so you know where you stand. This book""Snow in August"" starts out with a great story about a friendship between an eleven year old Irish kid and a Rabbi in 1947 Brooklyn, a time and place I know well, having grown up there in those years. But the ending ruined it for me. I won't give it away, but it really, really sucked. Big time. Come on Pete, you coulda been a contender but you opted out for the cheap shot."
3,Snow in August review,"This book is about a young irish boy who lives in brooklyn. Him and his mother live there after his father was killed in the war. He meets a rabbi and becomes very close with the rabbi. They build a strong bond throughout the book. Michael teaches the rabbi english and all about america, while the rabbi teaches him yidish and about the jews reliegon. Throughout the book they face many challenges dealing with racism and inequality. They had many times of seeing people being unwanted because of their race of religan. They wanted the world to be more interacted with different races. They used many different things to acomplish their goal for equality, for example thy used magic to help them teach the people that are racist such as the falcons, a local gang, a lesson. They also have to deal with death due to world war II. Throughtout this book they form a tight freindship adn learn many lessons."
3,"Good local color, weak on plot","While the Brooklyn environment of 1947 or so is very ably described, including Catholic-Jewish tensions as well as hope for improvement, the resort to magic and legend in the plot can only be considered unfortunate. If it didn't really work for Isaac Bashevis Singer how could it work for Pete Hamill?Also, it is doubtful that an educated Jew from Prague (Rabbi Hirsch) would speak Yiddish at all. He would probably speak German and perhaps Czech."
1,"Great begining, end just lost me","This book started out wonderfully, with great vivid discriptions and real life problems. I could really relate to it, until the end. The book just changed around completely. I thought it was awful."
2,disappointment,"Although I enjoyed this story and the reading, the quality of the tape was disappointing. I understood that the tape case was cracked which I thought would simply be cosmetic, but several of the tapes kept flipping over to the second side and it was tedious to try to locate the right spot let alone to get the tape to stop flipping. I wouild actually like to return this purchase, but I'm not sure how to do this!!"
2,cute but tedious,"On and on it goes about race, religion and, of course good and evil. Forget this and spend your money on anything by Steinbeck."
5,Moving story of an unlikely friendship in post-war New York.,"The unlikely friendship between a young Irish Catholic boy and a Rabbi in 1950's New York City & the boy's coming of age, plays against the backdrop of predjudice and attitudes of the time. Pete Hamill skillfully builds up to a mystical ending. This is the 2nd Hamill novel I've read & highly recommend anything he's written."
4,Amy's Review,"It was an easy book to get into, but the ending made me not want to read it again. It had a happy ending, but it sounded like the author was trying to cram too much information into the ending. All the loose ends turned into a big happy knot at the end."
4,Wonderful Story--Strange Ending!,"I agree with other reviewers concerning this book in that it is wonderfully written and the friendship between the main character and the rabbi is quite special, poignant and charming. I also agree with the others in that the 'supernatural' twist at the end seemed out of place and definitely unexpected. However, if one enters this book with the knowledge that it ends like a fable or child's tale, perhaps the reader can enjoy it more when knowing what to expect (but I will not ruin the ending for anyone!)I stumbled accidentally across this book and when I started to read it, I was quite happy with the selection I had made!"
3,GREAT book - until the end,"I agree with the reviewer above who thought the book was great except for the last 40 pages.Pete Hamill is a great writer and writes vividly about a young Catholic boy who befriends a rabbi. They learn from each other - and the reader, in turn, learns quite a bit about religion, struggle, and friendship. The book is intense and you will not want to put it down! It is unfortunate in the way it ends, however. It just is not a believable or even possible ending, in my opinion. I thought I might have missed a detail when I was reading the events that unfurl at the end, so I even re-read the last 2 chapters - but it still was unsettling, and I didn't miss any details.It's a great book until the ending. This high quality story deserves a much better ending than the one Pete Hamill chose to give it. Read this book for the learning experience and 90% of the book - the last 10% is just not the way it should have ended."
2,Disgraceful Ending,"I feel the author cheated me. Most of the book is a fine story of an Irish Catholic boy who befriends a rabbi in post-war Brooklyn. Through Jackie Robinson's first season with the Dodgers, Rabbi Hirsh's stories of Prague under the Nazis, and the menace of a violent local gang, young Michael is learning important lessons about hate and racism. The reader is led along, expecting that at the end Michael will have learned how to cope with the uglier side of life without himself becoming hateful or violent. Instead, the author gives us a ridiculous cartoon ending. Shame on Pete Hamill. I give this book two stars rather than one only because until the awful ending the book was quite well done."
5,Interesting and worth reading,"This book deals with many aspects of life: religion, baseball, gangs, and death. Based in the post-war 1940s, it was written in the perspective of an 11-year-old Irish Catholic boy growing up in Brooklyn. He learns about Judaism from an orthodox rabbi, and gets in trouble with the neighborhood gang. This book documents his journey through learning about what happened in World War II, and what the Jews are really about."
3,Great Policy Writing but Dubious Science Facts,"As an addiction and drug writer, I was thrilled to see a book specifically on designer drugs. I found the politics side of the book good, while the science side rather lacking.If you're looking for a book that follows designer drugs' evolution and entry into the masses, as well as the legislation surrounding them, Synthetic Panics delivers. If you're looking for good hard science, pair this with another read, perhaps like ""Buzzed,"" a simple, yet effective, handbook on illicit drugs."
3,good book,have not had alot of time to read it but i was told its a book to have in your library if you like this kind of book
3,Pre-pagan Lifestyle Options,"You may like this book if you want to live a more pagan lifestyle and integrate a bit of magic into your home. Nothing harmful in the least, in this volume."
2,Jumbly Mishmash,"This book is stacked with lore. Nice for a light read, but if you are looking for a really useful book with practical information (and less superstition), pass this one by."
4,Mindfulness of One's Surroundings,"This book is like all of Scott Cunningham's books, easy to understand, helpful, creative, basic yet founded on deeper knowledge. It has a lot of interesting lore and folk magic and much Feng Shui type of ideas. It discusses correspondences in good detail. It has information on cleansings and purifications, pets and plants, the household altar, the hearth or ""heart"" of the home, furnishings, moving, protection, the bath and the kitchen...even the garage. It is useful and grounded and homey. It will aid in focusing intent and provide inspiration for making one's dwelling into one's truly magical and personal home. Most of us, whether witch or not, instinctively surround ourselves with little ""magics"" that help us to feel comfortable and in ""our own space."" This book puts some thoughtfulness and understanding to the concept of personalizing our space and encourages creative and harmonious atmosphere where good vibrations abound. Try it. You'll like it."
3,good in some aspects,"Maybe it's just me, but I just find it hard to jell with Scott Cunningham's writing style. I picked up this because the title appealed to me, and I thought maybe it would be different from his others, but no. I find it hard to wade through a old lore here, a spell there, etc. Most of his books have good information in them, but seem to be written is a kind of meandering style that just doesn't grab my attention. This probably would make a good housewarming gift for someone, particularly a Scott Cunningham fan (of which there are millions)! But for me personally, is was so-so."
1,I wouldn't buy it!,"I read this book and thought it was filled with useless information. It was boring and I barely got through it. It's old so if you really want to check it out, you can probably pick it up in local library or used book store. Don't waste your time or money."
2,A few good tips,"A lot of this book is outdated and kind of silly. It's worth reading to pick up a few good idea's but with any book on magic, you have to remember that you are the source. Really the only thing that i found valuable was the trick about cleansing the houses energy with salt. That's tried and true. It's kind of the witches version of Feng Shui."
3,Household Magick,"I like the book, but I miss Robin Woods' illustrations.On the other hand, Llewellyn probably suspected that R.W's illustrations were too foofie for male readers, but they should have gotten someone better.Besides that, there's folk magick galore, and ideas ranging from useful to 'interesting'. Much humor, and doesn't get too hung up on Feng-Shui the way many many books of this ilk do. (not bashing it, it's just not for me. You can't do Jack with Feng Shui in an apartment) Something for everyone but the High Magick minded."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,As anything by Scott Cunningham this book is very well done and you can read it cover to cover. It gives you many ideas of how to bring magic into your everyday life and into your household... Worth every penny!
2,Better info elsewhere,"Pretty old books. First volume is just trig tables that your calculator will give you. Next two volumes have all the gear formulas, but not a lot of explanation on how to apply them."
4,"""Williams music will prevail""","Varese Sarabande presents this CD of suspense and intrigue, with John Williams at the helm. Much different score than what we've heard in the past, dark and foreboding, creates the perfect mood for the film. The underscore is forever present, with a haunting theme interwoven beneath this mask of deception. Williams is a true champion of any task set before him, whether action, comedy, drama or suspense is the game, Williams music will prevail.Total Time: 42:53 on 14 Tracks/ Varese Sarabande - VSD 5280 (1990)"
2,Huge price premium for Firewire,"I have had a 380n Sony UX PC for the past year, and love it (after removing all the crapware and reverting to XP). I bought the far cheaper Sony external DVD burner with the USB2 connection for maybe $90 and it works great. No need for this unit and its Firewire connection unless you really want Firewire."
4,"Revenge, raw emotion and excitement!","This is an awesome movie for those who love revenge ficks! Anthony Wong is one of my favorites, and this movie reminds me why I love him!"
4,Revenge Is Sweet,"Over the weekend, my husband I watched Punished on DVD. I find myself drawn to movies that revolve around crimes and revenge, so after seeing a preview for this film, I added it to my list of movies to see. I was fascinated with the plot and the acting was great. Punished has a unique feel to it and I'm glad to have it in my collection.Disclosure: I received a copy of this DVD for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own."
4,Worth the money! But still...,"This is the GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH!!! Yeah, Wringling Bros. I said it. Zane Lamprey travels the globe taking in the local drinking cultures and ultimatly hangover cures. It's fun, ""Zane""y and actually quite educational. But it is NOT a drinking game... Heh.The Only reason this did not get a 5 out of 5 rating with me is it is in Standard TV format. Three Sheets is originally broadcast on an all HD channel called Mojo. But unfortunatly Mojo overlooked the HD Format all together. This was very disappointing, especially because I do have a Blu-Ray player and was really looking forward to an HD title from them.The show is great regardless! But in HD, the sites and sounds are that much more sharp and crisp."
4,Drink Up With Three Sheets and Zane,"I was a bit disappointed with the lack of ""extras"" contained with this first season of the show, but we love the show and we've already watched both DVD's! If you haven't seen the show, I would strongly suggest upgrading to HD and checking out MOJO to watch the show. Or...just watch some of the episodes online to wet your appetite, first."
3,fair price for the product,It worked ok on my ukulele and is an ok product it didn't meet my needs for stabalizing the ukulele neck. I ended up making my own.
1,A piece of junk,This product hangs on your neck. The guitar is not balanced. It is unstable. This is a literal piece of junk.
2,No interest.,Couldn't hold my interest. Just didn't want me to get any more. The mystery wasn't there. Just not my type of book.
5,No home should be without this tool,This is the most extensive computer research tool for teaching history. Learning it right from the words of our founding fathers and so many others. This information is not in your average history book. The concordance and bible search is fantastic. Having All this and a dictionary at my fingertips made my lessons much easier. Thank you William Federer.
3,"Enz are strong, too bad about the audience loop","This CD, is good, infact it is very good. Recorded in 1992, the band are in fine form, both Tim and Neil Finn give very strong performances and the band are tight and the banter in between the songs is strong.However the audience loop is highly distracting, it is extremely loud and in more than one place runs over the top of vocals and/or banter making it inaudible.The audience loop is the difference between what could have been a five star album and the three stars I've given it."
2,Cost,With shipping and handling my total cost came to: $12.98 for one pair. I can purchase the very same product locally from Walmart for $2.39! Item was as presented on Amazon but the cost is prohibitive.
4,Helpful,"These are definitely a 'one size fits all' liner. They were much larger than I was hoping/expecting. However, they fit perfectly into the pair of shoes I ordered them for (ladies size 7.5 flats). Now maybe my husband will let me wear the shoes since they won't tear up my heel anymore!"
3,A SEISMIC SENSATION!!!,"This was the first Motion Picture Soundtrack purchase as a pre-teen. (8-track tape...who knew ) Although my parents thought it an odd choice, I bought it with my own money (paper route)and couldn't wait to get home to play it! It has become one of my all time favorites. Alhough short, it is an exciting listening session, complete with the rumbling sound effects of the earthquake and aftershocks/danger montage. This music helped to make an otherwise cheesy, effects driven disaster flick much better! Much better than his Poseidon Adventure score, John Williams has made this, along with his Towering Inferno soundtrack the absolute best of this kind of music. Daring, exciting, highly emotional, this pre STAR WARS soundtrack adds a completely satisfying addition to the world of John Williams Movie music. One of the things that i like best about Mr. William's work is that he is instantly recognizable, always different, forever original. Go on, try it, you'll like it!"
5,Scary Movie,This film was really scary and I thought the plot was well done. The actors did a great job for a low budget film and I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to be frightened and enjoy a good Thriller.
5,Memories,"I remembered seeing this film in French Class during high school after reading the novel, on a film projector. I enjoyed watching it again and intend on watching it yearly. In addition, I would recommend The Hunchback of Notre Dame and A Tale of Two Cities."
1,Les Miserables - Lite,"While other reviewers may have found this a worthwhile set, I did not enjoy either movie. In truth, the 1952 version seemed to use the same screenplay/script as the 1935 version. I have thoroughly enjoyed the book in several readings, and on audio, but these two movies are ""disneyfied"" corruptions of the story. I realize that two hours is not enough to do justice to Victor Hugo's tale, but the 1978 version is a much better attempt than either of these. I must say that I also resent it when screen writers re-write a masterpiece. Fantine does not meet Cosette before she dies! The absence of the Thenardiers leaves out two important characters that should flow throughout the story as symbols of the ills of the society being portrayed. If you would like to see a version of ""Les Miserables - Lite"", then these are for you; however, neither version conveys more than a smidgen of what Hugo wrote."
4,Les Miserables,"DVD was received in a prompt and timely manner and was received in excellent condition.I prefer the 1952 edition, but it's great to see them both and compare."
3,"A bit stodgy and stagey, but worth seeing...","This 1935 version of LES MISRABLES has interesting cinematography (the sewer scenes have Valjean and Marius traversing a near-mythological underworld) and fairly solid performances by March and Laughton (who leaves no scenery unchewed, but is still effective). Still it seems dated and very stagey--with that early-talkie sense of there being a little too much dead air. One senses the limitations of the cinema of the era, although we're only four years away from such (technicolor) splendors as ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of OZ."" The art of movie-making must have been growing by leaps and bounds in these years. Well worth seeing as a slice of cinematic history. Admirers of Hugo's novel can, with some justification, complain about its treatment of the classic tale, but compared to more recent cinematic attempts at realizing the author's vision, it holds up rather well."
1,Riot Act,"I can't believe what they did with the barricade scenes. The noble cause of the students and the lower classes was turned into a riot, and those same students were pictured as ""Rebel Without A Cause"" louts stirring up trouble. Now, I understand, this was the '30s, Depression Era, the government did not want anyone getting any ideas about revolutions, but this character assasination saddens me. And by the way, people, Les Miserables is about far more than Javert chasing Valjean. It's about freedom, and hope, and opression, and guilt, all those universal topics all of us face every day of our lives. You can't get all the feeling of the book in any of the adaptions, save perhaps the musical, the only version where the writers obviously read the unabridged book. So take my advice, forget the movies. Go see the musical and read the book instead. You won't regret it."
5,"""I give to you, so you can give to others.""","In France in the early 1800's. The poor are hungry. Petty-crimes are punished harshly and unjustly. Those released from prison are blacklisted making it difficult or impossible to get a job. An ex-prisoner, who has served his time for a petty-crime, jumps parole, because it is the only way he can get a job, though the penalty if caught is life pulling an oar on a ship as a galley-prisoner. A petty, policeman hunts the now-wanted man.The 1935-version is best because it leaves you with something, with a moral. The 1952-version changes the story enough throughout the movie that it is interesting even if you have just watched the other. Each version does some things better than the other. However, only the 1935-version leaves you with uplifting thoughts. Both versions portray injustice that continues today."
1,DVD NOT as described,"This concerns the DVD itself, not the movies. Amazon lists this a a 2-Disc set, and perhaps at one time it was, but that is no longer the case. I received a single, 2-sided DVD with the 1935 version on one side and the 1952 version on the other.I detest 2-sided DVDs. They're usually less reliable to begin with (often skipping and freezing) and are more prone to further scratches and damage. It's a terribly cheap way to package these films and it also makes no sense since both versions could easily have fit on a single side.One disc instead of two is bad enough, but why not at least put both movies on a single, one-sided disc of better quality?"
1,I'm miserables,"I feel duped! Purchased the video an demand version expecting to see my favorite, Charles Laughton. Got some other guy instead! Very disingenuous!"
4,Enjoyable movies,"The 1935 version is the best one of this collection, it has more dept and the story flows better. Well worth the price just to see this one."
5,Les Miserables without the music !,"If you want to watch the story ""Les Miserables"" without the music, the 1952 version of the two films offered in this DVD is very good. It is a serious telling of the story and Michael Rennie carries the role expertly - giving us introspection and quietly leading us to examine systems that seem to be in place - usually for some set of reasons involving the exploitation of people - He portrays the death of the human spirit, until rescued when he rescues a woman - He then begins to come back to life, but will always be changed from his imprisonment and brutal treatment. This is a heavy and serious film and a good one to share with someone - inviting discussion afterward."
2,The Wretched Who?,"I enjoyed this movie. It was pretty, entertaining and touching. As a movie, it did its job. As an adaption of the classic novel, I thought it was horrible. The entire plot was Valjean's escape from Javert and Cosette and Marius' romance rather than the wretched ones, the rebelling, poverty stricken French citizens striving for a better life. It's too bad that by watching this movie someone who has never read Hugo's story will never fully understand why it's so loved."
5,Outstanding classic movie,"If you are a Les Miserables fan, you have to have this classic. It is not a musical! The acting is classic and old school but it is very good. The Les Mis story is clearly told and if you have seen the play or musical version, this will add to your enjoyment of the story."
4,fun & easy workout,"This is such a a reasonably priced product. The ball and band are so easy to use. And the video that goes with it gives you a nice starting point, if you don't know what to do with them. It's amazing how many different things you can do with a ball and a band. But, it is fun too. I find myself giggling like a little girl.Try it!"
2,Unrated is Unworthy.,"I saw this movie in the theater and loved it. I'd give the theatrical release 4 or 5 stars. This unrated version is horrible! The original ending was changed. Luckily the special features has it, but then it's not with the continuaty of the film. Scenes were changed, deleted, information's lost etc. I found myself watching this DVD thinking, ""this movie sucks! I know it didn't suck when I saw it at the theaters."" Apparently there is a full screen version, same as the theatrical release, you can get on DVD.Bottom line on this unrated version - don't waste your time. Especially if you saw it in the theaters and loved it. You will be sadly disappointed."
3,The Ex,"This film is a pretty lack lustre affair, that severely under-uses Braff's talents. It is fairly easy going and has some funny moments, but nothing truly gut busting. I struggle to write much more about it really! If you want a chilled out film, that doesn't take itself too seriously and don't mind a touch of Hollywood cheesiness, then this film should suit you fine. Good, but not great.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,Awful DVD release!,"My 1 star rating is for the unrated version of this DVD release, and not for the theatrical version of the movie itself. This is BY FAR NOT the funny movie that was in the theatre. This version has a lot of stuff cut out, including funny stuff and material that helped with character development. Because of this, the unrated version is a chore to watch. It is actually 5 minutes shorter than the PG-13 version available. IF YOU SAW THE EX IN THE THEATRE AND LOVED IT, YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THE PG-13 RATED VERSION, WHICH IS EXACTLEY THE MOVIE THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE THEATRES, (which I give 4 stars)."
3,Ex This Out From Your To Watch List,"The Ex, the latest Zach Braff romantic comedy, lacks the intelligence and the sincerity of his other projects (Garden State, The Last Kiss), but it's still an entertaining way to spend one and a half hours. Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Smokin' Aces) is absolutely hilarious as the ex with a hidden dark side.Lucian Maisel's trick alone is worth watching the movie for. Does anyone know if the kid is actually able to do that?"
3,WORTH A LOOK,"I thought this movie would suck but it was actually pretty good. The pitch was nothing engaging but the wide cast of young and old actors truly pushed the picture up. Note that this presumes you like the actors in this movie and don't find them irritating. Bateman was awesome. He played the cripple card to the hilt and made everyone feel bad as he tried to manipulate the (insert expletive here) out of everyone. The ending and other scenes just didn't feel right. That said, it's worth a look. MY GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: 10/05/2010."
4,This is the version you want.,"IF YOU SAW THE EX IN THE THEATRE AND LOVED IT, THIS IS THE VERSION YOU WANT! THIS IS THE VERSION THAT WAS SHOWN IN THE THEATRE. The unrated version has a lot of material cut out, including a lot of character development and stuff that made the movie funny in the first place. This PG-13 version is 5 minutes longer than the unrated. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that this rated version is available in widescreen at this time."
2,Pathetic!,"As much as I love Zach Braff and Amanda Peet, I really thought this movie was a bust. I would have given it 1 star except for the two of them. This is a very dark ""comedy,"" and most of the movie is rather depressing as Braff goes from one predicament to another. You feel sorry for him rather than wanting to laugh. Jason Bateman's character is really too diabolical for a comedy, and the constant pratfalls are just not funny. The movie seems to miss its beat somehow. The concept is sort of cute, a guy whose boss just happens to be his wife's ex, but the movie is more like a foray into an evil and disturbed alternate universe than the side-splitting hilarity I was expecting. I would not recommend this movie."
3,THIS ISN'T THE VERSION OF THE MOVIE YOU ARE WANTING!!!,"THIS IS THE ""UNRATED"" CUT OF THE MOVIE WHICH HAS MOST OF THE FUNNY PARTS CUT OUT. YOU WANT TO BUY THE ONE THAT IS THE ""FULL SCREEN EDITION"" WHICH IS THE ONE IN THE THEATER.The unrated version has MOST of the funny parts cut out and the ending isn't the same or as good. i wish i read the reviews for this version before i bought it but i didnt. so hopefully i have saved yall from buying the less funny version of the movie like i did.BUT the full screen edition IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! DEFINITELY BUY THE FULL SCREEN EDITION!!!"
5,Great Movie,"Worth watching, great movie. It will make you laugh with Braff's low intellingence and Bateman's pure evil. Also A guy in a wheelchair goes down the stairs."
1,A Miss in Every Sense,"Zach Braff, Jason Bateman and Charles Grodin have all been funny on many an occasion. This film just isn't one of them. The film does nothing that the viewer does not expect from the previews and has two, maybe three chuckles in it. It is neither ""Outrageously Funny,"" as Bill Bregoli from Westwood One put it, nor does it contain any ""off-the-wall go-for broke zaniness"" as another reviewer put it(See the DVD cover.). Overall, it is a story that holds the viewer on edge, waiting for the insanity and laughs to ensue. Unfortunately, as the end credits role, we may be happy to see the villain get his just desserts, but we find that we didn't laugh much on the way. Be glad you didn't drop the $9 to see this one in the theatre."
1,Lame,"Braff and Bateman are funny actors. The plot is so lame that it defies explanation. They do the best they can with their parts, but the movie has very few laughs. I tried to explain the one funny gag about the ""yes"" ball to my brother. Nothing. It was a bad sign. Watch Scrubs or Arrested Development in stead."
1,"Movies must be Rated, or they should be banned.,....","I am tierd of unrated movies on the market, they must be rated, or they should be banned from sale."
5,"silly plots, but among the best action movies ever made","Yes, I do mean that: these are among the best action movies ever made -- but I'll qualify by adding ""which involve humans doing athletic things"", such as martial arts movies. (I like the other kinds too, BTW.)But if you enjoy watching incredibly gifted athletes doing great stunts done in a very believable way, and don't mind preposterous plots, then these movies might tickle your fancy. Just being able to watch David Belle (said to be the founder of parkour/parcour) is worth the price in my opinion.So remember, don't expect any Profound Commentary on the Human Condition (thank goodness). Don't get too hung up on the silliness or the stereotypes, that's part of the fun. Just relax and enjoy great escapist fun with a good companion or two."
5,Different that the original series,"This is the 3rd installment after OVA's if you want to go in order. Each episode is a short story attempting to keep track with the chapters, however, this one is a little more uncensored (in this version) than the 1st and the situations are a little more mature as well. The original returning characters plus the additions from the OVA to include a flower girl, Lala's younger twin sisters, and a new body for the ghost. The humor is still there along with their adventures, but you still get involved trying to figure out who will Rito choose from all his vast selection. The flowchart for the love connections are pretty linear, however, there are some weird ones as well."
4,CORRECTION: This is the 2nd season,"Thanks to the folks who pointed out that this is actually the second season and not the first. So this collection is complete.I saw this one quite some time after I saw the first season. I mistakenly thought it was from the first season because of an episode where Rito is subjected to a gender transformation and becomes a girl. This happened in one of the first season episodes but it happens to him again in the second season. This is what led me to think this collection was from the first season.This is a really funny, crazy series that is a lot of fun to watch."
3,Woop,"This is funny, but if you are expecting a good story look elsewhere. This is just like the other series, pointless fan service."
4,Dirty Beasts,"Dahl and Blake are top notch in this 1983 collection of short stories. However, reading this book as an adult, I was surprised at the overt racism in one of the poems. The Flying Cow features a ""horrid man who traveled from Afghanistan"" and then calls him a ""silly foreign freak"" as the cow poops on his head. Unbelievable!"
5,Goodness Gracious Me,A classic piece of Dahl lunacy. Whether you are 5 or 50 this Roald Dahl classic will have you squirming and tittering. Quentin Blake's wonderful illustrations capture Dahl's beasts and bring them hairily to life.
2,Mecanografia al Dia - Contenido,"I only recommend this book to students who are interested in learning typing using a typewriter. I don't suggest it at all if you are trying to learn using a computer. Also, it is important to note that the book uses the spanish keyboard, so if you plan to learn/teach using an ""english"" keyboard, I don't recommend it.I will use this book for my classes in typing for Spanish speaking students. However, I will only use some of the exercises in the book. I will definetely not use it to teach content. Some of my students will order the book to use as background, but only because they don't understand English and this is the only book we have found in Spanish."
4,sleepy time jazz,"there is some jazz that seems to be for the bustle of the day, busy, energetic. then there is some that seems to be for the calm and quiet of the evening, relaxing, winding down, getting ready to slip into the place where the human consciousness turns to dreams. this album is one of those.i bought this when i was first getting to know jazz and hard bop, and this is such a departure from what some would call jazz, ie miles davis bitches brew and records of that nature- its hard to believe they're even lumped under the term ""jazz"".this record brings to mind great visualizations of springtimes in japan with cherry blossoms, of peace and the formality of a japanese garden, and the quiet grace of the japanese people..if you're expecting something that swings, this isnt it. if you want a truly deep and spiritual- in the eastern sense of the word- jazz record, this is it."
3,EH...................,"The only good tracks on this cd are ''tokyo traffic,mr broadway,and osaki blues.'' they others are slow and boring. Joe is a little sleepy on this album because of the arrangments and tempoes. Only recommended for serious Brubeck collectors, like me."
5,Deserves a Reprint,"I read this book many, many years ago, and have never forgotten it. I kept thinking someone else wrote this book, and had to search long and hard to find the true author. I wish this book could be reprinted. I would love to buy it and have a copy. It was wonderfully written and nice to read. If anyone can get their hands on it, give it chance, you wont be disappointed."
4,Glory and the Lightening,As with all others from Taylor Caldwell this is a good read. I am always amazed at her various subjects. I just couldn't make it through this book.
4,"Read this, nitpickers","Maybe the author could use a better editor, but still the MINOR nitpicks didn't take away from the enjoyment of the book. This isn't a police procedural. It's FICTION. It's not REALITY. So get a life, people. Ninety percent of the books in this genre don't have anything to do with reality. I thought Zen and the Art of Murder was much better than City of Angels, but I still enjoyed both books. Zen is a unique character and for those of you who want to compare this book to reality, Zen lives behind a pet cemetery. Clearly, the author wasn't going for real life settings. I guess most people didn't get this. Too bad. You're missing out."
3,Worth the Read,"An impressive effort from Elizabeth Cosin. At times, the novel was slow-paced, nearly unbearably. The beginning was also quite boring, but once the action it started... well, as they say, when it rains, it pours. Despite being hard to get into, I did thoroughly enjoy this book. Plenty of the key ingredients desperately needed by any murder-mystery fan. Overall, quite a good book."
3,Come on...,"Five stars for an author who tries to be musically hip, but doesn't know the difference between Percy Sledge (""When a Man Loves a Woman"") and Percy Faith (""Theme from a Summer Place"")?Five stars for a character who doesn't know that airplanes fly at 35,000 feet, not 35,000 miles?For a buddy pairing ripped off straight from Spenser and Hawk?For interior monologues that sound like the deliberate cliches of Tracer Bullet in Calvin and Hobbes?Puh-leeze. This was an okay read, nothing more."
3,Childlike magic,"I first saw this book as a child, and it ignited a strong interest in science and exploration. It looks as good today!"
5,Absolutely stunning,"The first Tintin book I ever owned, and along with the second part (Explorers on the moon) is still the one I love the best. A witty, clever tale with suprise twists and turns, great characters and all those fantastic drawings of the spacecraft itself. These two books played a huge part in starting my love affair with SF, and I'd even say they influenced my decision to write novels of my own (now happily published)If you want to see how a true master does it, buy this book. Just make sure you pick up Explorers on the Moon at the same time."
4,Amazing but difficult to read,"I am so excited that Tintin has been brought to life again. I have very fond memories of reading it as a 10+ yr old. I have brought a few copies to read to my 7yr son, mmm, not as easy as I remember. I think I'll have to read them myself and then wait for him to be old enough to read them to himself! Not a bedtime story book! But none the less I am pleased to have a few copies of this amazing adventure book series."
2,Johnny Tillotson 25 all-time greatest hits,"I bought this CD but would not have if I had known that most of the recordings were from live concerts. This is typical of most recordings of live performances, poor quality sound and generally disappointing presentation."
3,Decent CD,I was satisfied with the CD. The quality and sound is very good but I only liked 5 of the songs personally.
3,NOT A GOOD QUALITY RE-RECORDING,"DISAPPOINTING, WE GREW UP WITH JOHNNY TILLOTSON AND LOVED HIS MUSIC, BUT THIS IS VERY POOR QUALITY RECORDING"
4,The All-Time Timeless Masters,"Johnny Tillotson's soothing harmonies swooned audiences through much of the '60's, and the tracks on this compilation aptly demonstrate why. Of all this artist's releases, including the ""Best Of ...,"" this one is easy the best and most comprehensive. A pleasant surprise are some unexpected standards, but the main draws are the chart-busters like ""Send Me the Pillow ...,"" ""Talking Back Tremling Lips,"" (which no other artist has been able to score like Tillotson's energetic and soulful rendition), the classic and timeless ""Heartaches by the Number,"" & another near two dozen cuts. Not only is Tillotson's compilation a refreshing nostalgic blast, it's proof of the timelessness of songs performed by a true artist. Buy the disc! Promise, you won't regret it."
5,"Lawrence of Arabia, a classic film score for the ages....","David Lean's epic film from 1962, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is one of the big screen's finest achievements due in great part to the sweeping score writen by Maurice Jarre. Here is a match as close to perfect as I can imagine of spectacular visuals supported by stunning music, more than ably recorded for the Original Soundtrack release. For me, the listening experience was as enjoyable as viewing the film but after a few years, the soundtrack disappeared into vinyl memory. That is until I recently purchased the CD and to my suprise, Sir Adrian Boult's beautifully conducted score is as evocative and magical as ever. I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do."
4,It could have been better,I love Ani don't get me wrong..I live for her but this C.D. is a bit too short and leaves a bit to be desired.
4,Military and Naval Workbook,"I bought this book when it first appeared and was amazed at the wealth of detail, location maps and the general presentation of what is basically dry fact. There is a wealth of understanding of the times and events, that the author was able to bring to the the lay reader, that stands out in my mind even today. He provided military undestanding, foundation and logistics for the campaigns waged in these three areas. A major work for the WWII History 0fficiando"
4,simple and hypnotic with a lasting quality.,"I bought the cassette tape of this when I was about 15 years old because it was on sale and soundtrack music was the only music I knew of. At that time I hadn't even seen the movie. I loved the soundtrack back then and still do 10 years on because it is catchy, and had a soothing, hypnotic quality about it and one can listen to it again and again. Yes, I have now seen the movie and my view of the soundtrack has not altered one bit. Who else has listened to soundtracks before having even seen the movie?"
3,Rock Springs,A good read for those familiar with Montana life and the boring existence it holds for many. Certainly not a Hemingway or Steinbeck here. The sex passages are too cold to be real. This book will send many a westerner running to New York or LA to find a life or at least an existence that lets them know their alive.
1,Desolation of the Real,"For anyone interested in reading this, I'd just like to share my thoughts. This bok was one of the more depressing things I've read. The entire premise, it seemed, was that the reality of life in and near rural Montana is desolate, hard, and filled with things that quickly turn anyone apathetic about their own life. Its stories contain some of the most hopeless and luckless emotions and situations, and they can quickly transfer over to the reader. At any given point, I could have put the book down forever and not care at all. This, I think, is the direct result of all of the main characters being desolate, powerless, numb males. They didn't care about the outcome of their lives, and I didn't care about their outcome either.Sure, the writing style may be great from a literary standpoint, but let's be honest. What kind of person would want to read something so bleak - just because it's written well?"
4,Good Stories,"This is my first exposure to Richard Ford. I picked this up, based on the reviews found here. While all of the stories are involving, they seem to gain depth as one moves from one to the next. Ford tells his stories simply, never trying to impress or dazzle his readers with multiple syllables or obtuse references. Because of this, the stories unfold naturally, as if told by a friend, and the characters seem all that much more human. Fans of Russell Banks and Richard Russo should enjoy this collection."

4,"Fantastic, for David Newman and Heathers lovers!","I ordered this CD from Amazon.com, and although this is only the instrumental score.. it's great! I love popping it in occasionally whilst doing work or relaxing and listening to some of the great funky 80s'ish Heathers tunes. A must for any fan of David Newman and definitely the film Heathers. A collectible! To discuss the soundtrack, or the movie - join the discussion list, email heathers-subscribe@onelist.com"
5,totally enjoyable,"A simply enjoyable book for those of us that appreciate art but do not have the time nor the resources to devote much time to it. One can sit down and just study one or two pictures and feel the sense of the picture. I have found my 13 year old paging through it at times and studying the pictures. I don't think I could get her to read too many other art books. Sister Wendy's reviews give us a place to start to think about what the artist was trying to achieve. Perhaps having this book in the home will lead to a greater interest and study. But, if not, it will surely make one appreciate the diversity and beauty of the art world over the centuries."
5,From an Artist...,"This Nun is a maverick in taking the reader off the beaten path of Art appreciation. Sister wendy has a great point of veiw in showing the power that Art has. It's endless capacity for Truth. How the pieces of Art in this book are a mirror showing us to ourselves. (not to mention some of the Art and Artists were new to Me also) No matter how much we think we know, there is always something new we can learn, and this wonderful book is an example of that."
2,Disappointing,"Usually a DK book is THE DEFINITIVE book on its topic. The problem with this book is that the ""masterpieces"" are not always the definitive ones. A number of the world's most famous works are missing and a number of inclusions are not so famous or particularly good. Suggest you go with her original, less expensive work, ""the Story of Painting,"" and Wendy's videos, which are expensive, but very good."
5,Wealth of information!,Though it is disconcerting to have the artists in alpha order...ending up with a realistic painter on a page next to an abstract modernist....the information that Sister Wendy provides is very helpful. It is a good first reference for any artist.
3,Not the best book on art,"As an art history student I have seen many things about art as well as seen many paintings in this book. My question is what was she thinking with some of her selections? The tub by Degas? Hello. Lots of his work is more well known. Ballet dancers anyone? Also the ""masterpiece"" by Van Gogh, is one i've never seen. Being my art teacher's favorite artist we covered him in depth but I've never seen that painting. I would have picked Starry night or even Night cafe. Goya was another. He hated his pictures of the royal family so why pick one as his masterpiece? The traits of the royal family (she said were in the painting) were ones he made up! Some of the masterpices were also ones anybody who knows art the least liitle bit knows. For example the Old King, another was Grunwald's Crucifixtion. Also she also used scandel and contversory to become a masterpiece. Olympia by Manet."
3,Too many paintings with suggestive homosexuality for my liking,"I am sure this is a wonderful collection of art(being as I know nothing about art). That being said, I do NOT like SO many paintings that suggest homosexuality since this was intended for my kids to freely view & read for our christian homeschooling environment! The captions with the art describe these paintings as being this as well, it's not just by own observation."
1,horrible exp to try to change out the battery,"I'd never buy this again. Rubber came out of place, and the batteries were a nightmare to get back in place and ran out quickly."
5,Awesome Album,"A treasured addition to my'Golden Groups & Artists Collection',thanks Amazon for a timely delivery and for always keeping my shopping time to minimum;I can always find what I'm looking for.Thanks,T. Lindsey"
5,S.S.S.,"Spirited, Special and Stunning, An brilliant album from Earth Wind & Fire. But then, I have yet to hear a bad album from this group."
2,Plagued with Inaccuracy,"This book contains a lot of summary judgement which falls outside the authors' expertise. False emphasis is put on words in the original languge which serve the author's purpose rather than Scripture's. In addition, metaphors and examples often fall dangerously short and are logically flawed.If required for a class, get it. If not, consider C.S. Lewis."
1,NOT THAT GREAT!,"I've seen this movie many times, so I've heard all the music in the movie many times as well. I loved the music so much that I paid $40 for the soundtrack not knowing that the soundtrack was either comprised of different versions or just didn't have the music that was in the movie. This purchase turned out to be one of my biggest disappointments. There are a few tracks that were in the movie, but almost all of the music on this album is a different version plus there are a lot of pieces of music from the movie that's missing like the music at the beginning of the movie and I especially loved the music when Macready and the others discovered the thing beast devouring the dogs, and it's missing.........UNBELIEVABLE! Honestly, I think this is a waste of money considering the amount of money that was spent."
2,Nothing special,"I've seen the movie many times, and was expecting John carpenter's eerie background music, not this dull work which never even reminded me of the film. It did not even contain most of the scary synthesizer sounds which made this film a true classic tale of horror. I guess this CD would be okay to play on a boring, rainy Sunday evening by a candlelight dinner; it's that thrilling."
2,dad,Music overshadows narator. Graphics and games not near as advanced as they could be. I like useful learning interactive activities for kids and this does not fit any of those.
5,Perfect Trust,"This is an excellent book. I have purchased it several times because I give it away to people as I meet them in their circumstance, or I have recommended it to them, and given it."
2,Sonically disappointing - Lacking in expressiveness,"The selections presented here are wonderful. But this CD has sonic issues. At the beginning of the CD before the music begins, there is a short static sound. Although unusual, I don't consider that a big deal, but sporadically throughout the entire CD there is static. Most notably during track 3 `Sorcerer's Apprentice' at 9:30 - 9:58 and again during its climax at 10:51. Also on track 4 `Symphonic Fantasy After Dante', static is heard during the climax from 23:46 to the end of the piece. I also sensed a lack of expressiveness in the performances and was not surprised to discover that the pieces were electronically conveyed to the organ via computer.I also bought Josh Perschbacher's 'Carnivale' and 'Sinfonietta' CDs, with which I am also disappointed for similar reasons. I noted sonic issues with these including some very strange digital anomalies.However, I commend Josh Perschbacher's efforts, and his devotion to the organ and fine music."
3,organ orchestration,"The concept of this recording sounded intriguing, that is a complete orchestral score translated to an organ console. But upon listening to this cd, I found it sonically thrilling and well recorded, but it somehow lacked the ""personality"" that a transcription played by one person on the keyboards would. It all sounded too mechanical rather than a live performance. I'm happy to have this cd in my organ collection, but mildly disappointed in the results of the concept."
2,"Promising story, but...","The Pleistocene Redemption is an interesting story, that would have been a good book in the hands of a better writer.The interesting, if unimaginative, premise is that, through genetic engineering, a theme park and preserve is created featuring an extinct Ice Age fauna (including Cro-Magnan and Neaderthals). As in Jurassic Park, things get out of control.Gallagher's writing is very poor, however. Cliches are everywhere. He has a very annoying habit of italicizing all the emphasized words in his dialouge. His characters are flat, and he never allows his characters actions to reveal anything about their feelings. Gallagher takes the lazy way out and just tells you how they feel.Not a very good book."
1,probably the worst book I have ever read,Thank god I read this book while working in a used book store. That means I did not pay any money for the experience of wading through the incredibly bad prose and extraneous plot lines.
4,A must read for the adventurist!,"From the beginning you are caught up in the web of intrigue and I had to remind myself this was just a book. The relm of possibility is scary of what we could be facing and we need to be careful of what we choose to do with our future. A fast paced, thought provoking book. Can't wait for the the sequel."
5,A fine first novel with good science behind the fiction,"I found TPR fast-paced and exciting, entirely too hard to put down. From my point of view as an intelligent and reasonably savvy non-scientist, I found the science in the story a little far-fetched, but very well thought out and internally consistent. Too many authors writing adventure stories contrive any pseudo-science that advances their story; Gallagher deserves credit for taking the time to do it right. I look forward to more."
2,"good, but not thrilling","Just because I like paleoanthropology doesn't make me biased, but it was enjoyable, that's all. The character development wasn't good and the plot was questionable to realism even as a sci-fi. I thought I was reading a poor rendition of Jurassic Park."
5,A vision of future scientific discoveries.,"Scientists might argue with the science of TPR, but whether it's accurate or even plausible science is not important. For me, an educated but unscientific reader, the novel offers a vision of who we are and how we got here. The characters and plot draw us emotionally into the story, and the science keeps us fascinated. The story is more compelling because we feel the same curiosity the novel's characters feel about our ancestor organisms. Fortunately, Dan left himself room for a sequel. I'm looking forward to reading it."
1,The Painful Redemption,"I always try to think of something positive to say when I review a book or story, but in this case I don't think ""makes a nice doorstop"" is relevant. If I could give a zero-star rating, I would. At one point in the book, a character loses the ""lower third"" of his head after being attacked by a giant turtle, and goes on for a good while before finally, blessedly dying. There's no grounding in reality at all."
2,Christmas Pudding by Nancy Mitford,"A friend recommended Nancy Mitford to me and I bought ""Christmas Pudding"" and ""The Blessing."" Frankly, I don't get it with ""Pudding."" I thought it was as leaden as the article after which it was named (and yes, I do have a sense of humor). A week later I read ""The Blessing"" and loved it. If you, like me, don't care for this one, my advice is not to give up on Nancy Mitford."
3,"Listenable, but not great.","This album was done while Bruce was still with Maiden, and it's quite apparent he was trying out new styles he could't do with them. Not really his best, although it's OK. I'd advise checking out his later solo albums if you're looking for a true continuation of his IM style."
4,"tastes great, hard & crunchy","However, not all the bars in a package are the same size. While one package has two bars that fill the entire container the next one you open might be two half size bars. It makes you feel cheated."
5,"Yum, yum, yum.","Holy moly, this stuff is delicious! These bars taste like Starbucks pumpkin loaf but with about half the calories and twice as filling. I'm so glad I found these gems!"
2,Not square,"The cards themselves are very pretty until you go to cut them out, There is four cards to a page and because they were not printed ""square"" or aligned properly, when you cut them out they are not all the same size. I find that this is true of the all the postcard book that I have bought that have 4 cards per page. The little books that have one per page are much better."
4,"Beautiful postcards, perforations a bit of a drawback","These postcards are absolutely gorgeous. The color is very nice, and there is a great variety of different options for the various postcard recipients in your life.The only drawback is that these come in a book format and need to be torn out (which leaves a less-than-perfect perforated edge). Still, for the price and the number of postcards (24), this is totally worth it and still highly recommended.Also, Amazon shipped this super fast!"
3,"Great printing, but thing cards.","I was pleasantly surprised to see that the color on these was nice and bright. Often with Mucha reprints you find dark, dingy, brown-tone things. The printing is crisp and high quality, though I'd prefer a matte card.However, the card itself is quite thin. It will probably be fine for travel within your own country, but I'm not sure how it will fair on international journeys or countries will less reliable mail services. I suppose I'll find that out soon enough though."
5,Along came the Best,"It's a awesome movie and I love the score!. Jerry Goldsmith has again come out winner. Along Came A Spider is the best. Hats off to Goldsmith for a another memorial score. This Soundtrack is one of my favorites. Track 7, ""Ransom"" and Track 8 ,""Cop Killer"" are the best Tracks on CD. This is what you expect from a legendary composer like Jerry Goldsmith ."
4,pretty darn good,some very far out trivia mixed with some familiar q and a make for a very entertaining trivia book.
4,Ratermann and Brosi do it again!,"A rip-roaring ride through the land of basketball trivia. Ratermann is poignant and articulate. His best work since ""Two on the Aisle"". Brosi's research is immaculate. I laughed as I read through the section on ABA trivia. I cried when I read that Cindy Crawford never scored in an organized basketball game. A must read for the basketball fanatic that can't find the information on the Internet. I am looking forward to reading the next work of these brilliant associates. Bring on the next book!!"
2,Milking It,"If you are reading this because you keep hearing how great the Sisters are (were) and want to hear it for yourself, DON'T buy this album. Go buy Floodland instead. That, and parts of Some Girls Wander, is what most people are raving about. This compilation is, for some strange reason, dominated by songs off the horrible Vision Thing album instead, which will give you a completely false picture of this once-great band. For Sisters collectors, this collection is an even worse choice. You lot should be buying Some Girls. Yes, I know it's more expensive, but it has all the tracks you need. The original Temple of Love! Alice! Gimme Shelter! Body and Soul! And the entire Reptile House EP! Give this collection a miss. A Slight Case of Overestimating Your Own Importance, Andy."
5,Slight Case of Overbombing ~ Sisters of Mercy,"Andrew Eldritch is a truly tallented artist and a good lyricists. I love the lyrics for temple of love (1992) and this is a truly one of his greatest tracks and having the vocals of Ofra Haza makes it an even better track. Edlritch is an underappreciated vocalist and his unique and different sounding vocals fit this kind of music perfect. There are so many amazing tracks on this greatest hits compilation, but if I had to pick a few then it has to be under the gun, doctor jeep and temple of love (1992). The book-let is quite nice and the logo is awesome as usual. However, the text is like miniscule and it is quite hard to read. This is an awesome greatest hits collection from a truly great rock group."
1,A big disappointment.,"Unlike most SOM fans who have followed the group since their early days, I only recently became interested in these goth rock legends. I bought their first album, First and Last and Always, to start out, and consider it to be a gem in my CD collection. This caused me to become interested in their later music, but I couldn't decide on which CD of theirs to get. So I got their greatest hits to give me an overview, and I have to say it is a big disappointment after having known only the material from First... The numerous eight minute long sagas sound aimless and repetitive and lack much originality. Even old favorites, like No Time to Cry sound weak with the added effects. This album definetly should not be a starting point for those who are new to the SOM because it will only turn away new listeners."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I'd never even heard of the Sisters until recently but then I listened to This Corrosion. WOW what a cool sound. It's funky 80's goth/industrial with a Nick Cave impersonator as the singer. What could be better? If you're a fan of modern industrial and goth. Check out the Sisters, it's where it all began. A little nostalgea is good for you."
4,"If this isn't an example of their best stuff,","then I definetly need to get the rest of their albums. I hadn't even heard of the Sisters until a friend of mine played this album for me. I have rather ecclectic music tastes, and have some of just about everything in my collection, but at the time I didn't have any ""goth"" music as I'd never been around it anywhere. After I heard this album, I immediately bought it the first time I saw it in a record store. As I find this to be a great album, but most of the serious Sisters fans on here say that there are much better tracks not included, I'll definitely be picking them up eventually. Andrew is undoubtedly one of the best songwriter and vocalists I've ever heard.P.S. The reason the lead singer sounds like a guy is because IT IS A GUY. Don't take the ""Sisters"" name too literally, i.e. Marilyn Manson and Alice Cooper."
3,Sister please.,"Not a bad collection, BUT, could be better. Songs go from new to old. Many are not the studio versions, which can be good or bad. Bad here. And I believe the weakest tracks from ""First and last and always"" were chosen. I personally am in shock that this ""Best of"" does not end with ""Some kind of stranger."" Ok, maybe not in shock. The ""new"" song ""Under The Gun"" with Teri Nunn (Berlin) is great. Nice to get a ""Temple Of Love"" in here. I think all the Vision Thing tracks are shortened or lengthened. Why? The right selections from Floodland. Still your best bet if you only want one of their albums."
5,Gothic and exhilerating!,"I love this album. My favorites are Under The Gun and Temple of Love....the music is so gothic, dark yet exhilerating! Also good with lots of bass and volume.If wanting to know what SOM is like, this one is a good one.A great album to play at dance parties."
5,great looking and comfy too!,These are my favorite pair of business shoes. They look really nice and feel like you have a tennis shoe on.
5,Hudson Hawk,Bruce Willis is great as Hudson Hawk and he can sing the classics. I would recommend this Soundtrack to anyone who saw the movie or likes classics.
3,List of songs,1. HARD LOVE2. TAXI DANCER3. LIE TO ME4. ONE MORE NIGHT OF YOUR LOVE5. IT'S LIKE HEAVEN6. OUR NIGHT7. SHE'S RIGHT8. MIDNIGHT SUN9. RIGHT BEFORE YOU SKIES
4,magicians vs. machines,"I'm not a devotee of future-fantasy fiction, but both aficionados and non- of this genre should appreciate Reflecting Fires. The novel is a nicely compelling read, and yet is quite thought-provoking. In this far future age, magic (the 'bright mechanics') appears to be fading as technology (the 'dark mechanics') gradually regains favor with the people and the ruling classes. However, this magic vs. machines question is not debated, it merely serves as a vehicle for the story. Mr. Claburn has an economy in his style of writing that I appreciate in this computer age, where novels tend to have about twice or triple the number of words they actually need.I think this novel could make an interesting film, though it would require a ""cast of thousands."" I see from his website that the author has made films in the past, and I suspect this work was written with that in mind. Read Reflecting Fires and see if you don't agree."
3,Archaeology Myths,Condition of book excellent. Content questionable. The one area I looked up led me to believe author was envious of Barry Fell.
1,not what I thought it would be!!,"Do Not buy this album!!! This whole album is just a bunch of cheesy remade versions of her classic songs. There is less heart & soul in the vocals, and the productions are really Realllly bad. Although Barbara is probably my favorite soul singer, I give this album 1 star (if I could give it zero i would!!) If you want to hear any of her real music the only place to look is on the Arctic & Buddah label. the only good music you'll find from her on cd is The best of the Buddah Years. Seek out her records, these best of & copilation cd's are a joke!!!!"
2,Not the Orginal HITS,"When I purchased this CD, I thought it would contain the hits found on the 45 copies I had. Not ture. The sounds are not the same as the orginal hits. Thus, I was really disappointed. The Good news is, if you like Barbara Mason and good songs.. then you might like this CD. Since the songs are indeed good songs. But don't buy it, if you truly want the hits has played on the radio back in the day."
3,Watch Out!!!,"Despite the fact that this CD is called ""Yes, I'm Ready"" the version of ""Yes I'm Ready"" on this CD is NOT the original. This is a newer 1990s re-interpretation.I like Barbara Mason and it is always good to hear her sing anything, old or new."
1,Not Happy,Not the original 60's or 70's recordings. Overproducer late 80's/early 90's production with synths and reverb drums. Not what I was looking for.
1,This is not about the Honey Swamp Monster!,They tell you that he doesn't exist and it is super boring! It is just a very amateur guy talking into the camera saying that it was a hoax.
4,"STIRRING CIVIL WAR DRAMA IN ""BATTLE FOR GLORY""","It's been a long time since I've seen a really good Civil War drama, but ""BATTLE FOR GLORY"" more than fills the bill. Lots of interesting characters and drama are acted out against the threat of war breaking out between North and South. And when it does, all hell breaks loose! Miles O'Keeffe, who played Tarzan in that Bo Derek movie, plays a Yankee soldier who takes over a plantation and holds some Southern Belles hostage, and things heat up from there. I don't want to spoil any surprises, but you won't be disappointed when you rent BATTLE FOR GLORY."
4,OK - Minor Problems,This is decent and cheap storage cabinet for CDs and DVDs. The only problem is it is very top heavy when the doors are open and the shelves are empty. Once you have loaded up the lower shelves it stabilizes and all is well.
1,cream is awesome; pad is very disappointing,"I had great results with this product with the first use. However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle. I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a ""dud"", but had the same thing happen with the second pad. The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively. If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product. On a positive note, I love the facial product!"
1,Complete waste of money,"While I usually like Neutrogena products, this is such an absolute waste of money, I'm taking the time to warn others. The vibrating, rather than rotating pads are completely useless is removing dead skin cells. I'm so disappointed in Neutrogena for producing such a ripoff product."
1,Save your money!,"This is an absolutely useless and inconvenient product. The pads don't rotate, just vibrate and that doesn't do anything for exfoliation. I used for a couple of months with no results."
1,Big Disappointment,"I explected the microdermabrasion head to rotate, but instead it vibrates very strongly in your hand. My hands are still buzzing from the night before when I used this product.I would not recommend this product to anyone else, I loved the crystals cream."
3,Neutrogena microdermabrasion system,"This inexpensive device really works. It leaves my skin clean,soft, and supple - even at my age, 64! However, I think the microdermabrasion pads (puff refills) are over priced at $.51 a piece. I re-use mine several times before replacing them. I'm giving the system a 3 star rating due to the expensive puff refills."
3,ATENTION PLEASE - THIS IS ONLY THE Sing-Along Edition,"This is the Sing-Along Edition and not the 2 discs special edition.It is the restored version, but without the Road Show Version.For that purpose buy it from Amazon.co.uk (Region 2 )the only available editon with full movie restored with the American Version presented after the ""première"" in the first disc and the Road Show version in the 2nd disc.It is included also the Sing Along option.The 2 pack DVD is really a masterpiece much much better than this edition only with 1 version.Joo Pereira Bastos - Lisboa Portugal"
3,LCD TV/DVD combo 15 inch,"The ease of being able to move this item - it is so lightweight is a real plus. The LCD is a little fuzzy at times - but the DVD is great. You cannot get a wide screen on it like you can with the bigger ones but the ease of use is what is the best. I can work on the computer and view the TV at the same time. It is very sleek looking and the burnished metal look is also a plus. All in all, I am very pleased.Elaine LaMagna"
4,Great TV for Kitchen,We bought this TV to use in our kitchen because we had very limited counter space. For our purposes it has worked out great. The picture looks fine to us (we hooked it up to our cable) and the DVD player is an added bonus. For the money we were well pleased.
3,Cute dog costume,"Actually, it looks a lot more comfortable than other pet costumes and clothes that people make their pets wear. It's not like it's leather or some tight t-shirt. And at least the dog isn't stuck in a tiny purse being carried around as an accessory."
3,This one's OK,"I have been on a Jerome Jerome kick lately, reading everything. This one is OK, but not his best. Still worth a read."
3,A Hodge Podge Dozen Black And White Episodes From The Post Ward Bond Years,"Good film to DVD transfers here, beat the ones that appear in syndication. Timeless Media did a good thing by releasing season 7 (color 90 minute programs) in it's entirety. Full season releases of the hour Wagon Trains would also be appreciated more than these episodes culled from several seasons."
4,"ultimate o""jays","I consider this c.d. to be a classicone offerd by the o""jays, I recomend buying it for anyone looking to purchase it."
2,not as good,the songs that were made popular ar egreat but there are too many songs i don't know!someone should but ALL the top songs on one cd!
4,Why don't they have a complet box set?,"This CD is terrific. Every song on here is a classic. I only gave it 4 stars because it's missing too many hits. Why doesn't one of the most original groups to come out of the 70's have an extensive box set? Amazon has one listed that is from England I think, but it is missing way to many songs. And why haven't their albums been remastered and rereleased the way that they did Earth, Wind & Fire albums? Weren't The O'Jays just as good and deserving? I realize these guys have about 10 different greatest hits and were on more than 1 label, but come on, it's 2005 and we, the fans of The O'Jays, demand a complete box set."
2,Only the BIG hits,"This is a nice collection of the group's recordings from 1972 thru 1975 on Philadelphia International Records, all sung by original members Eddie Levert, Walter Williams, and William Powell. It may be ""Ultimate"", but it is not extensive or complete."
4,"It's classic style will ""live forever.""","Always a bit sinister and dark the compositions by Alan Silvestri keep the air of first certainly mystery and later impending doom in the air. Lush with instrumentation and simple in orchestration the music ushers you into the sometimes silly and twisted minds of our two far from deceased female leads Madeline and Helen ( ""Mad"" and ""Hell"" ). The opening number alone is pure camp, in it's best form, especially when it breaks into period disco. Ms. Streep is a joy to listen to with her unique and brilliant phrasing and the words are so silly...you can't help but want to learn it to sing to your friends."
3,Decent One Volume Commentary,"I own the 1986 Edition which should be simliar.This commentary is based on the NIV which is a modern and reasonably scholarly translation.This commentary is limited by having to fit in one volume, thus there is not as much analysis of the Greek and Hebrew as one might like. The commentary is fairly conservative though not literalist.It is much superior to Wycliffe, but falls below the New Interpreter's Bible. If you don't have $600 for the New Interpreter's Bible or access to it at your church library, the New International Bible Commentary is not a bad choice."
2,New International Bible Commentary,"Poorly written, it doesn't get to the meaning below the surface, It looked more like a repeat of the words written in the bible text. I didn't go through it thoroughly, but what I did see was a disappointment."
2,Not authentic Brother,"I have a Brother CS6000i and wanted to make sure I got the original Brother ruffler foot so it was easier to install and worked properly. The ruffler foot I got does NOT look like the one in the picture. Instead, it looks exactly like the other generic foot you can find on here for less money!!! I have seen the original Brother ruffler foot in store and it comes in a Brother box and looks like the picture for this one, Mine does not.It works fine, and although it was difficult to install, I figured it out. I am just extremely disappointed that I feel like I was lied to. This is not original; it is the generic."
1,Ruffler Foot,"I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. It was an expensive foot with lousy directions. There were only a couple of pictures for directions. There were no written directions, trouble shooting or anything to assist with using this foot. I purchased the ruffler foot because I make numerous garments with ruffles and I was hoping it would allow me to speed up the process. Unfortunately it takes longer than manually making ruffles. The metal clamps, for lack of better word, catch the fabric and there is not a guide to ensure you sew in a straight line. I would prefer to return this item because it is truly a waste of money."
3,Great value,"This product is a great value compared to local store prices. Does an excellent job of making a ruffle, however, you have to use it at a slow pace in order bit to break a needle."
2,Doesn't fit the machine it is made for.,"I really love my Brother sewing machines, of which I have 3. The Pacesetter NX400, the 1500 portable professional machine, and a computerized industrial. Unfortunately, this foot does not fit my machine. I wish it did. There are so many cool things you can do with a ruffler foot. I may have to find a generic model to fit it."
5,Have fun improving your life simply one step at a time!,"""Your Life only a Gazillion times better"" delivers an amazingly simple yet profound way to improve all aspects of your life one easy step at a time! Cathy and Judy May have taken the best of the ""self-help"" world and condensed it down, added their amazing wisdom to it, and created a fun easy-to-follow one-step-at-a-time way to create HUGE changes in your life! If you are ready for some fun and great life improvements this is a great book!"
4,never have to buy filters again,"Simple to use, easy to clean out, and you'll never run out of coffee filters again. I find that some fine particles get through that would not get through a paper filter making me have to clean my coffee maker more often, but this is so simple its not a real issue. Fits perfectly in the cuisnart 4 cup coffee maker suggested with it. Would buy it again."
5,Works for me,I much rather this over the papers. no more needing buy a pack of filters.... personally this will start saving me money within 6 months. I was also told that the coffee will taste better because the oils from the beans are not absorbed in the filter like with paper ones and it might just be in my head but i find it does really taste better!
3,Great product but,I gave mine away because I find it easier to just use paper filters and just throw them away. So I guess this product was a waste of money for me.
2,why so small,"I thought this would be close to filter size. It's tiny. I do use it, am getting used to it, but was a little disappointed that they can't make this to actually fit the size of the pot. I'm pretty limited on how much coffee I can put in it. If I want stronger coffee I use a filter. Also, there's a lot of sediment in the coffee using this. But coffee tastes fine."
4,great product,No need for paper filter anymore...It works well for us as we are not coffee drinkers but once in a while we love drinking it..this works well for filter..good replacement for paper filter..
4,definitely worth getting!,this filter is great! at first it seems like it doesn't fit perfectly in the cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker but i haven't had any problems with it. it's durable and easy to clean and SO much cheaper and easier (and less waste!) than the paper filters.
3,Cuisinart 4cup filter,"I have an older Kitchenaid coffee pot so I wasn't sure this filter would fit but it fit perfectly but hard to rinse out, cleans up great in dishwasher! You can't use the coffee in the bottom of the pot because there's coffee grounds in the bottom. I went back to using paper."
3,I went back to paper filters,"It didn't take me long to realize that this product wasn't for me. My coffee always had grounds in the bottom, and cleanup is NOT a breeze. Grounds stick to the plastic frame, and the filter itself gets residue stuck on it at the water line.I went back to paper filters."
5,Superior to Paper Filters,"I've been using this filter for over two years now, and it's still holding up well. Coffee beans retain flavor much better than when run through a paper filter. The ease of use amplifies the value, considering what a hassle it was trying to separate individual paper filters from their stack. The cost is both justifiable and easy to recover. I highly recommend the Cuisinart GTF-4 Gold Tone Filter."
3,Go with paper,"I bought one of these on the assumption that I could stop buying paper filters. Not because I'm an eco-type, but because it would save me money.But this filter is a nuisance to clean. I didn't expect all the used coffee grounds to dump out into the garbage, of course, but too much just stays in the filter & has to be rinsed out. I suppose that if you don't care about clogging your drain with coffee grounds, that's not a problem, but since I own my apartment, I have to deal with the downstream cleaning.So now it's hiding somewhere in the cabinet, against the time when I run out of paper filters and need to buy more."
1,gold tone #4 filter is really four cups,"Ok, So I just thought if I bought this along with my 10 cups krups coffee maker it would be a winner. However it only wins if you make 4 cups in you 10 cup brewer. My mistake for thinking #4 meant something other than four cups. I always make 10 cups, so the little bugger is useless. Cute, but useless to me."
1,Too Large,There was absolutely no way to fit the filter into the top of a 4-cup Cuisinart coffee maker! Maybe a 12-cup coffee maker would accommodate the filter?
1,Garden spray nozzle,"Difficult to adjust, holes leak whenOn a setting where holes should not beFunctioning, like shower setting, therefore lowering spray pressure."
1,Leaked like a @#$$%,I ordered 2 of these. One works fantastic. The other one leaks terribly. I would not recommend this because you don't know what you are going to get.
4,"Good, but not great","A little tricky getting full jet spray (you have to relax your ""trigger finger"" a bit). Takes a little getting used to, but miles above the basic hardware store product."
2,Great Idea ~ Poor Quality,"One of the nicest nozzle ever owned until it broke. The nozzle spins around and prevents the hose from kinking - wonderful! However, it is made of plastic and the connection below the trigger broke. It's still kinda useable but if you don't watch out, you will get wet. For the cost, should last much longer. Would recommend but be very gentle with it."
3,It's just the stylus.,Why in the world does just a =stylus= cost $25??I own the Sony UX280P computer and it is terrific. I will be sure to never lose or damage it's incredibly expensive stylus!
4,Mortal Fools,"This story of murder and deceit is fresh and involving. It was a page turner to the end. I liked ot very much, and recommend it to anyone."
4,"Exciting, Suspenseful Read to the Last Page!","The story is well told, original and intriguing giving readers enough information to satisfy, but yet as little as possible, to ensure that they need continually to turn the page to find out more. The characters are likeable, so it has a warm, deceptively cozy feel, which is juxtaposed with unexpected twists and turns of tantalizing mystery and titillating romance that holds the reader on the edge of his seat to the last satisfying page!It all culminates excellently with a shocking revelation that is not overblown and exaggerated, but casually underplayed, thus bringing power to the climax. I never guessed it would end this way!I highly recommend this book for all readers and especially those who love an exciting and suspenseful mystery!I can't wait for the author's next book"
5,A highly recommended and authoritative work,"Schuon's approach to both Christianity and Islam takes the reader to new and unexpected levels of understanding, where their outward differences are seen not as irreconcilable alternatives but as necessarily different crystallizations of a unique sacred Reality which itself is above all forms. Schuon writes with a certitude--and without the usual scholarly references--that readers often find either shocking or, just the opposite, absolutely refreshing and clear. His erudition verges on the encyclopedic, but even more important is his insight into the ""inward intention"" of so many traditional beliefs and practices that, while perhaps challenging the conventional mentality of the modern world, are meant to deliver a kind of ""spiritual shock"" which opens the soul to what transcends its limitations. The following excerpts from reviews show that Schuon certainly deserves the attention of serious readers."
5,My My mY!!!!,Great Stuff! The eyes on the cover move! I swear they followed me everywhere! That's what attracted me to the book..and then I was hooked by the writings! When's the next book coming out? How can I meet the author?BRIGUY
1,Poor quality,All the blades fell apart and landed down into the machine I was working on. Happened the first day I used it. No more china made tools for me
1,A few paragraphs.,"I was hoping for a critique/analysis. Not much of that. One could buy many beautiful used books on this subject for this price.A ripoff, very dissatisfied."
2,not quite,I mainly use the CD to practice test questions. The questions are worded incomplete. Don't provide enough information to come up with an answer. Statements are even worse. Very confusing.
2,lippincott's nclex-rn review book,Although the book was good...it was way out of date. I need to know the date of edition before buying anymore books. I'd like to get books that are current for this type of material.
2,"Helpful practice book, but watch for a few things...","I used this book to study for my finals in nursing school. I noticed that on my final i came across a question very similiar(actually, identicle) to this book. My professor used 5 questions from this review book on the exam.My problem with this book was a few things. The wording of questions were ackward. For example, ""Impending hypoglycemia"" measurement. If anyone knows the meaning to ""impending"" and what the value range is for hypoglycemia is would understand why there is a flaw in how the question and answer do not match up. If anyone thinks differently, let me know. I think the answer given is incorrect or in the least misleading--needlessly.I recommend Mosby's NCLEX- RN made incredibly easy and Kaplan's NCLEX review instead."
5,"Very ""User Friendly"" review","Great review, thorough with a CD that has study, exam, and quiz selections. Buy it at the beginning of the year and use it throughout, it will help with nursing concepts and practice, as well as prepare you for the NCLEX-RN."
5,CGFNS - a breeze thru this tough exam,"This book has a massive collection of questions covering a broad range of topics needed to answer the cgfns exam.The CD which is part of this book has a nice program which has a random question generator from the various topics. Extremely helpful to evaluate your performance on the test.If you can consistently get over 80% on these practice tests, you've cleared your cgfns test.Note: In addition to this book you need to have supplemental study material too. The more the material the better your preparation for this exam."
4,NCLEX-RN,I don't known whether this is correctly to prepare for NCLEX-RN. Mosby's may be better; some one who taken this exam told me.She said Mosby more lively to take this exam.I try to my best. I read this book very day. I want this is best same me.
5,I pass the NCLEX the first time,I highly recommend this book esp. if you're out of college for more than 5 years because it would refresh all the knowledge you have learn in school.It really helped me analyze the questions and choose the correct answer.The CD rom was helpful too since it was similar with the actual CAT exam and it would give you alot of practice on how to take the NCLEX under pressure.Good Luck and I hope this book would also be your next bestfriend.
1,Watch out!,"I purchased this book to prepare myself for the NCLEX-RN and was very disappointed with the results. I took MANY of the practice tests on the CDROM and after completing them I would review the questions the computer said I had ""missed"" only to find that the computer was marking them as the correct answers when I reviewed them. The book says you must score 75% on their practice tests in order to pass boards, and all my results were in the 74-76% range, but with many of the ""incorrect"" answers ending up being ""correct"" it did not help me do anything except be very stressed out! I took the Mosby's online practice and scored in the 94th percentile--a more true reflexion of my abilities--I passed boards without any problem, but no thanks to this book."
5,Richard's Piggy Review,"In this book, a pig got adopted by a dog named fly on a sheep farm in Gloucestershire, England. Then one day she named him Babe and it stuck. Then fly had to do something with the boss. Then they came back with a sheep. Then Babe asked what is that mum? There is the stupidest animal on earth, sheep. Then Babe wanted to meet the sheep.So he did then he asked what her name was. She said it was Ma. Then Babe wanted to meet the flock. So they made a plan. It was to let Mr. Hogget and Fly go to the market. Have Ma go back in to the flock. One day, Babe went up the hill and saw the sheep running like crazy. He felt anger against the dogs. He ran after them; then he rammed one in the side. One day, Mr. Hoggett went to the trials with Babe in the back of the truck. Will Babe win the trials? I think this book is for any age. I recommend this book to read for fun."
5,Great Animal Book,"This is the best animal book ever(except Charlotte's Web.)It's about a little pig named Babe,who is adopted by a dog,Fly.And I like pigs and dogs.Get it."
3,Kevin's babe review,"One early Sat. morning in DeMoines, Iowa, Farmer Hogget wondered what a squealing noise was coming from the fair. ""What's that noise coming from the fair?"" asked Mrs. Hogget and told Mr. Hogget to take some pies down to the fair. So he did. While he was at the fair he heard the strange sound again.He followed the sound until he came to a pig. It costs ten cents to guess his weight, and if you get it right then you get the pig. So he tries, and he wins! They were going to make pork chops, two hams, and liver. Babe met a dog-named Fly; she adopted Babe. Pretty soon Babe was as good of a sheep dog or sheep pig as she was.One day Babe met a ewe named Maa, and while Fly and Farmer Hogget went to the market, Babe went to visit Maa. There were sheep rustlers. Some how Babe saved the sheep. So they did not kill him.Babe gets signed up at the Annual Sheep Trails. Will Babe win? I recommend this book to all readers, because it is meaningful, suspenseful, scary, and sad."
2,O my gosh dont bother,"Smith, Dick. Babe: The Galliant Pig. Knopf Paperback.118 pages.Knopf's Babe The Galliant Pig is an inspiring, and heart-warming story about a pig that goes to the Hoggot farm. At this farm Mrs. Hogget is having dreams of a big fat pig that she can make into bacon. The pig's destiny is breakfast until Mr. Hoggot reveals a talent Babe has. He is a sheepherder. Babe is the best sheep dog Mr. Hoggot has ever hade. Shortly after finding babe's talent he is entered in a sheep-dog championship. The audience is confused to see this sheep-pig. Will this galliant pig win the tournament? Babe The Galliant Pig is the most pointless story I have ever read. There is hardly any plot, and the ending was enormously cheesy. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
2,THROW BACK FROM EVOLUTION,"I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE ALL THE EVOLUTION TALK IN THIS BOOK. I READ THIS BOOK ALOUD TO MY CHILDREN AS A PART OF A DINOSAUR UNIT STUDY. MY 7 YEAR OLD REALLY LIKED THE STORY BUT, MY 4 YEAR OLD NEARLY CRIED EVERY TIME I PICKED UP THIS BOOK TO READ. ...A NICE STORY FOR THE CHILDREN, I HAVE READ WORSE."
1,By far the worst book I've ever read,"I was forced to read this book in fourth grade, and I still cannot forgive the school board for making me read such a deplorable book. If I wanted to describe how awful this book is, I'd need to speak in Mandarin, and have Harry Browne translate. If you must read this book, read it as quickly as possible, and try to put your life back together."
2,watch the reading level,"After reading many reviews, I purchased this book for my [...] year old who is reading on a pretty high level for his age. I found the font to be quite small and with very few pictures. So watch the recommended reading level originally stated and don't be convinced by other reviewers who have smaller children reading this book. My son gave this book back to me. Better luck next time."
5,Great book! You must read it!,"Butterworth, Oliver, The Enormous Egg New York; Little Brown and Company, 1993. 188 p.p.I think this book was great. It is about a fiction book about a kid named Nate who finds an enormous egg in the chicken coop. It hatches into an animal. The animal grows and grows. Soon it got too big to stay there so they shipped it to the Washington D.C. zoo.My favorite part is when Nate was riding the animal and a truck honked in the animals ear. Then the animal knocked the truck on its side.I would recommend this book to 4th - 8th graders."
4,The Enormous Egg,I like this book because it has a dinosaur in it. The book made me laugh a little bit because a chicken has an egg and a dinosaur hatches; they name him Uncle Beasley. Dr. Ziemer and Nate Twitchell take Uncle Beasley for a walk around Freedom New Hampshire. Later I was angry and sad when they said to destroy Uncle Beasley. In the end Nate Twitchell gave Uncle Beasley to a zoo. I give this book 99 percent. :<)
5,For anyone who wants a dinosaur as a pet,I first read this book over 40 years ago. It was facinating and well written. It's a wonderful adventure. I re-read it numerous times in the years since. It's kind of like a great movie; you will re-read this many times through the years as it really makes you feel good.
1,This book is not worth the $45 price tag.,"This book tells the student repeatedly to ""send the file to Drive A and remove the read only status."" However it gives very little attention to relationships and join types. Also there are numerous typos throughout the book; some of which are obvious and others will cause the student to pull out their hair in frustration. This is a decent book if you have a good instructor who can steer you around its pitfalls...."
4,Terrific soundtrack -- score AND songs!,"This is a beautiful score by Maurice Jarre that's bookended by classic cuts from Roy Orbison (the title track) and, best of all, Van Morrison's sublime ""Someone Like You."" It's a short but sweet album that I love to put on to relax and have a bit of bubbly with. Check it out!"
2,What a disappointment...,"The movie was great, the tunes in the soundtrack of the movie were great. The only tune on this CD is ""Only the Lonely"" by Roy Orbison. The rest is the instrumental soundtrack associated with the movie. Big disappointment... I wanted the tunes...."
4,Doesn't read like a first novel,"Strong effort. In the paperback the print is tiny, give us a break next time, because this writer shows great promise. Loose the drawing room confrontation next time. Good action, good time."
3,Overrated,"Still River is a decent private-eye novel, but no great shakes. The problem: the protagonist keeps doing things he knows are dumb, even thinks to himself they are -- yet, he does them anyway... Sigh. With a little work, the author could have given him real motivation.A first novel I suspect. Too bad, because the action scenes are well done and Hunsicker certainly knows Dallas... I'll check out his follow-up novel from the library!"
3,"Good, but not great","Some have compared this book to Lehane and Connelly. While I understand the comparison, to me this book just didn't have the same cachet as those. Hank is interesting and there are the well-armed, violent, gay-couple sidekicks, but I never felt connected to them. Hank gets beat up and shot, and shot, and shot but is the proverbial Timex. There are a lot of bad guys without any of them being memorable. The dialogue is good, although the author needs to ensure he does not overuse the phrase (paraphrasing) ""If someone knows of a better...I wish they'd show me."" The author works too hard at cleaver names for his characters: Lee Henry Oswald, for a book set in Dallas; Vera Drinkwater, client with an alcoholic brother; bad guys Clairol and Fagen. For all that, the story moves well and there are some clever moments. The book was good, but didn't knock me out."
1,garbage - why is there no option for ZERO STARS,"Plain and simple, this is not metallica, this is cowboy music.Not only have they released crappy albums, they destroy all their old material when they play them live. I really hope they call it quits or die."
3,Disappointing,"When I got this album when it first came out, I thought that it would be a another really great album. I had heard many rumors that metallica would be going back to their 80s sound, but instead they go and make Load. Most of the songs don't live up to what metallica is. There are a ges songs that are good like until it sleeps but most of the album is bland like king nothing and the house that jack built. This album has marked their decline as metal pioners to metal downfall."
3,NOT GREAT BUT NOT TERRIBLE EITHER,"I'm giving this album 3 stars because about half the songs are pretty good and the other half are laim. Compared to Metallica's earlier work, I thought this CD was kind of a let-down because MOP and RTL only had one lousy song each. This Cd has 8 good songs, so it's worth buying. But don't expect it to be as good as The Black Album and all their other albums prior to that because it's not."
4,Ohmigod! You mean-- Things CHANGE?????,"I'm really sick and tired of hearing people pna this album as the downfall of Metallica. Okay, it's true, they mellowed out A LOT on this album, but it's still some quality music. Some songs bite, and some rule. And, I don't care what people say, ""Mama Said"" is NOT country. It's not metal, but it sure as hell isn't country. I doubt that Metallica will ever return to the style of ...And Justice for All, but who cares? As long as they keep putting out GOOD MUSIC, not necessarily good METAL, I'm satisfied. And by the way, who cares if they cut their hair? Nobody cares when the guys in Pantera get a haircut, so why should it matter when Metallica does? Just a thought for ya...."
2,80's Fans of Metallica Beware!,"As a long time fan of the 80's Metallica, this was a horrible disappointment to me after waiting so long for some new material from the guys. Not only has all the thrash been stripped away, but the rock has shades of alternative music throughout.Although ""Ain't My Bitch"" starts out more or less on the right track, the album soon becomes boring, because while the soloing, time changes, and little interludes have mostly disappeared from the songs, they are still mighty long. Metallica originally wrote long songs so as to properly let them breathe, but these alterna-metal snore-fests would be better if they were short.For what it's worth, the public seemed to love this and there was suddenly a new generation of Metallica fans, yet again. It seems that Metallica knew exactly what they were doing by taking time off and then coming out with a different sound that kept them in the mainstream. That doesn't make me enjoy ""Load"" any more, though."
3,good CD by any other band,"I would give this CD a higher rating it it weren't by Metallica.The songs are pretty good, but we all know what the band is capable of, so I had to ding it a little.I recommend this to non-fans, but you will be VERY disspointed in it if you ever listen to Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets."
2,"Metallica officially ""Jumps the Shark""","One star awarded for ""Until It Sleeps"", the second for ""Hero Of The Day"". The rest of this is an unfocused mess, and I liked ""King Nothing"" a lot better when it was called ""Enter Sandman"" on the previous album. Actually, this album should get another half star for being worlds better than anything that followed, but that's another story entirely..."
4,Last good album,"This CD is worth it for the several good songs that are featured: Until it Sleeps, Hero of the Day, House that Jack Built, Fuel. There are also quite a few decent songs that you probably haven't heard before: Ronnie, Wasted My Hate, Thorn Within. The sound is still genuine, unlike the forced crap that they're putting out now. So even if you aren't a diehard Metallica fan, you'll probably find something on here that you enjoy."
3,"Decent, if you're looking for change.","Though 'Load' is clearly not Metallica's finest hour, or artwork, I found it to be a somewhat decent album. As many of the other reviews have stated, 'Bleeding Me' is one of my favorites on the album, along side with 'Wasting My Hate' and 'The House That Jack Built'. Some good tracks and something different, three stars (two and a half, rounded up).But I would still much rather listen to 'Ride The Lightning' than this."
2,The day Metallica went crap.,"'Load' is a bad album of bad songs.This would get 1 star, but it's saving grace is 'The Outlaw Torn' and 'Bleeding Me',thus it gets 2 stars for these songs, which are addmitedly brilliant. It's lyrically,musically,and idea-wise (it's a bunch of rock ballads for christs sake!) a bad album. It is uninspired,plodding drivel and should be forgotten about. I respect Metallica for having the gall to change direction so sharply,but they seem to have forgotten what made them special in the first place,i.e being a metal band.It's depressing that a band can progress from starting thrash metal to being a dull mainstream rock band,in about a decade. If you want a '90s (studio) album by Metallica then get 'Metallica' or 'ReLoad'.Anything but this."
4,well...do you really want to know?,"Yes, I am a big Metallica fan, and own every album except for Garage Inc. My fave album is Ride the Lightning. That's enough about me, now let's talk about Load.Metallica proves, with this album, that they are still great musicians and have only improved over time. Their songs have so much going on in them. There are a lot of really good songs on this album, but there are also a few that aren't so good. I think they should go back to having 8 or 9 songs per album, because the album gets bogged down. Since I do love the old Metallica thrashing days, this album can seem like a cure for insomnia sometimes with the tempo on some of these tracks. But this album is still great. If you're more of a black album fan you will love it. I like it too. I just can't listen to it all the way through in one sitting.....zzzz....but when you do listen to this album attentively, only then can you appreciate all the work and the musical mastership this album has."
1,there's always shuffle board or checkers fellas.,"hang it up, or come up with a new name because you're not metallica anymore. i totally understand people getting older and obviously it would be even more ridiculous for these guys in their late 30's early 40's to still be screaming about jumping in fire. metallica is just a midlife crisis now."
4,"Hey, I actually liked this one....","Definitely not Metallica's finest hour, but I found this album to have a nice alternative sound. Who F***in' cares if they had short hair, pimp suits, and goth makeup back in '96? Not me. I like alternative rock too, you know, and I found this one to be particularly underrated.Ain't My B**** - 4 stars2x4 - 3 starsThe House That Jack Built - 4.5 starsUntil It Sleeps - 4 starsKing Nothing - 5 starsHero Of The Day - 5 starsBleeding Me - 4 starsCure - 3 starsPoor Twisted Me - 2 starsWasting My Hate - 4 starsMama Said - 3.5 starsThorn Within - 4 starsRonnie - 4 starsThe Outlaw Torn - 5 starsI don't know if I'd recommend this to the casual fans that LOVE metal and nothing else, but if you like Metallica and alternative rock, then give this one a shot."
2,Horible,"Two good songs: Until it Sleeps and Bleeding Me. From Metallica, this CD is HOrrible. What the @#$%s wrong with Hero of the Day, it sounds like pop. Pass this one up and buy some of their 80's stuff."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?!!!!,"AFTER RELEASING 5 OF THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL ALBUMS EVER RECORDED, METALLICA RETURNED WITH THIS MEDIOCRE ALBUM. THE ALBUM ACTUALLY STARTS OUT OK. BUT AFTER ''THE HERO OF THE DAY'', THE ALBUM JUST DESCENDS INTO RAMPANT BOREDOM. AND QUITE FRANKLY, IT ALMOST NEVER RECOVERS. THE BEST SONG IS EASILY ''UNTIL IT SLEEPS''. WHAT A LETDOWN FOR ALL THE METALLICA FANS. CMON GUYS, Y'ALL CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS!"
2,load of crap,"never thought my favorite band could go that low.unless your rich dont buy this disasterpiece,sorry for being so thruthful but this is not metallica."
3,Eh...,"I'm a long time Metallica fan, and I don't particularly care for this album. I know a lot people don't like their more recent stuff because it isn't ""heavy,"" but that's not exactly what I don't like. Sure, I wish they still kicked ... like they did in the 80's, but oh well. Where Metallica have gone down hill is that their songs are so basic and uninteresting now. There are a few great riffs and hooks on this, but just not enough."
5,The best any genre album ever,"Yes, Metallica has abandoned the thrash metal style. But its trademark musical integrity remains and is taken to the max. Every song starting with ""Until It Sleeps"" and after is incredible. Check out ""Thorn Within"", an unpublicized song of great power."
5,Load is Good!,"Everyone has a different opinion of this album. Although I dislike ReLoad, this album has great songs, like The Outlaw Torn. The Outlaw Torn is an excellent song, every part of it is good and it flows together so well. Mama Said and Bleeding Me are other good songs."
2,This ain't the Metallica I remember.,When I poped this cd in I thought to myself. What the Hell have these guys been doing for the last five years! The last I remember these guys could play. Now they just stink. I only liked two songs. on the whole cd. its not worth buying if you're a metal fan.
3,What happened?,"Man, whats going on? Every cool band is changing its style... and confirming Kravitz words: rock n roll is dead. Metallica, with this new album, became an ordinary band. There are thousands of albuns that sound just like ""Load"". Metallica destroyed its registered mark: guitars sounding like classic music and narrow space for lyrics. What happened? Are they becoming a punk band? You will find only three good songs in this album: King Nothing, Mama Said and Ronnie. The disease that is destroyng bands like Guns N Roses, U2, Type O Negative, Smashing Pumpkings, Motley Crue,and destroyed Fastway, caught Metallica."
1,Boy...what a stinker.,Metallica has not made a good albumn since 1988 and this record gives me no indication things will change any time soon.There is not one good song on this entire CD.Its just not the Metallica I grew up with.I understand Bands evolve over the years but these guys have taken it a bit too far.Metallica used to belong to us....now they belong to them....Wht more can I say...Its over...Its been over for years..It is time for Metallispears to hang it up.
1,A load alright,"yeah a load of crap. So Metallica sells out. They go ""alternative"" to sell more albums. Instead of remaining true to the ""artistic vision"" they produce what is a truly embarrassing album."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why I do not like this cd is that the Metallica cd's they made in the 80's where good and hard, and now all we got on this cd is a bunch of sissy crap! ""Ride the Lightning"", ..And ""Justice For All"", those were good cd's. This is not good, for us hard metal rockers we want hard stuff, I like Metallic, but this cd just doesn't fit my tastes as does I am sure many other hard rock Metallica fans. The only remotely good song is ""Until it Sleeps"", and you can get that on singles. We Metallic fans want the hard stuff, the way it once was, and unfortunatly is not on this cd, the music doesn't sound right."
2,"Oh my, the downfall.","Ugh, what happened here? The band really shows their creativity, yes, and have complexity, but the riffs...are GONE! WHOOSH! They're extinct! Metallica really have reached their low on this album. Gone are the great riffs, filled with jamming sessions. Not that that's bad. It's just the riffs that make Metallica. But, they do get better with the next album, Reload. I'm glad they aren't making stuff like this anymore."
2,"In my opinion, the worst Metallica cd.","In my opinion, this is the worst Metallica cd. The overall tone is depressing and the CD definitely lacks the fundamental drive I expected from Metallica.What I expected were some awesome catchy drum, bass, and guitar rhythms. But, this album didn't have that. Instead the album has an overall morose feeling to it.I hope the drive will come back because this CD seems to take the METAL out of Metallica."
1,EB multifx pedal boards must be destroyed,Is that a vox wah pedal in kirks pocket or is he just happy to see me
2,"2 1/2 Stars for Load alone, 3 1/2 with Fuel & Devil's Dance","This would have been a decent album if Fuel & Devil's Dance from Re-Load had been added and The House That Jack Built, Hero of The Day, Poor Twisted Me, Mama Said, Thorn Within & Ronnie been cut out -- 3 1/2 stars if this been the case.Instead of trying to release two albums chock full o'filler, the guys should have kept all their best material for one album. Although I do respect the chances that were taken with this effort."
5,Their change is a good thing!,"For all of the people out their that gave this cd bad reviews are wrong. You relize if metallica would of kept their old sound they would of faded out. This change they made brought them into the new age rock. That speed metal stuff was great at the time but would of not been popular today. They would of never been who they are today if they would of not made the change. It think cd has a lot great songs on it like bleeding me, hero of the day, and until it sleeps. I think any metallica fan who accepts the change should go buy this cd its just as good as their other's!!"
3,Hmmm....,"Well.....it IS different, but that's not necessarily a BAD thing. It's not nearly as fast or as heavy as all the previous albums, but it is an enjoyable listen for the most part. The first 10 songs or so are pretty good,but then, after that... it gets a bit boring. And sometimes, even annoying.... But if you're a fan that insists that Metallica sold out,(even though they did)and demands that they return to their older days...you won't enjoy it. If you do, however, have an open mind...you might want to give this one a listen....or something..."
1,I dislike Metallica anymore,"Maybe I sound like a lot of people but I really like Master Of Puppets and I think it's one of the best thrashmetal albums recorded ever, but Load and Reload? They are not worth a cent. That's it."
1,"Yep, It's Me Again!","I've written another review on this one, but it hasn't been posted yet so I'll bash this album again. First of all, I'll try to stay neutral after reading all the reviews: maybe they've sold out, maybe they've matured, maybe they're on crack, maybe they've grown up. That said, this album is the worst collection of refuse and nuclear WASTE that I've ever had the misfortune of hearing. If you want something new to add to your torture chamber, play this one over and over again. It works, trust me. Even my cat can't stand it. I actually sold this one to one of my friends (ex-friend now, and you can guess why) to make some sort of profit off it. The music doesn't have to be exceptionally heavy or fast, just QUALITY! A five-year hiatus is too much."
4,"Geez, people, realize what your saying!","Well... I personally dont like load as much as their previous work, but going downhill? No, they went the way THEY WANTED TO. They are older, and thus more mature. If you dont like it, I'm sure they dont care. Someone said they they care about their fans. Well, the fans dont care about the band if they disagree with what the band has done, eh? If you are a true Metallica fan, like me, you would realize its still Metallica, but just not quite as heavy.Metallica Is the greatest band of the decade, no doubt. i would say century, but they arent, Led Zeppelin and Ruse are clearly better and more tallented bands. Anyone who opposes that statement doent truely like music. You may not like Zeppelin, but they are more tallented Metallica."
2,Metali-who?,"Is this really the band that produced such classic rip-your-head-off anthems like ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Ride the Lightning""??? Forget LOAD; make no mistake about it, Metallica is now writing for the radio! Ever since they won their battle with their record company, they've gone downhill, fast."
4,On the whole this CD is very good,"Tracks like 4,3,7,12,1 are the best racks on this CD. I would have rated this Cd 5 stars if it werent for tracks like 8 and 11. But on the whole this CD is awesome and should have recieved a better rating"
1,I would give this 0 stars if Amazon gave the option,"Awful.....absolutely awful. Even though Metallica has sold out,that's not my gripe with this album. This is just poorly executed nonsense. It truly is a feeble attempt to reach a wider audience. This album is missing some of Mick Foley's testicular fortitude."
2,This is not heavy. NEVER!!,"Do you really think this is heavy metal music? NO. Of course, this work is worth 15 bucks for the kind of radio-metal or pop-rock fan. But then why don't they change their name first? For instance, POP MUSICA. This is never heavy nor metal."
3,solid album,"First off, Metallica was one of the first bands that got me listenting to rock and roll, and I thank them for that. i have listened to everyone of their albums, from Reload, the Black album to the legendary Master Of Puppets(their best and the second best rock album of the 80's next to Guns N Roses Appetite for Destruction). Load isn't nearly as impressive as the 80's Metallica, but it [not bad] either. Until It Sleeps, King Nothing and 2X4 are some of the highlights on the album, but there is definite filler on the album. Overall a solid performance."
2,I must be old,"I was really disappointed by this album. However, I have been disappointed with most of Metallica's releases over the last few years. I am assuming this is because they simply grew a different direction than I did."
3,Slow but still on top,"When I heard about this CD I expected the old heavy metal metallica, but hey what can you expect from a band thats been kickin' for almost 20 years, the times have changed too. I am not saying that this was a bad album, I personally think it was good. It was the begining of a new softer Metallica. They still impress me for their efforts. I do recommend this Metallica album for those who like them, but are thinking about settling on a more relaxing album. I recommend all (exept one) Metallica albums, they are all good. For heavy metalhead albums, I recommend KILL 'EM ALL, RIDE THE LIGHTNING and MASTER OF PUPPETS. If you are looking for a slightly more quiet and cool metallica, I recommend AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, THE BLACK ALBUM and this album. GARAGE INC. is good, but I prefer Metallica's own work and style, not already copyrighted songs. All is good exept for RELOAD. RELOAD is a piece of garbage ..., under any circumstances, do not buy that cd."
3,"No sell out, but disappointing to speed metal fans","I liked the ""black album,"" as did a high percentage of the millions of fans who bought it. However, because of the large number of sales, the band thought they should stick to the slower, distorted tone. They just took it a little too far with Load and Reload, and people called it selling out. I know that's untrue, but they did lose the sounds which they are best known for, and I hope that they will put out another album with that type of music.."
2,Thre good songs; a prewiew of what was to come...,"This ia a preview of what was to come.. Metallica walking over their fans, saying that they doesn't matter to them anymore. Sad."
1,The most infamous sellout in recent music history.......,"Yes, it is so true.What a waste of a once great band...."
2,just pretend its not metallica,"if this was some other band that wasnt as good as metallica, than this would be a better cd. just pretend songs like masteer of puppets and fade to black and one dont exist."
2,This was so stupid,"This album was definetly the low point of Metallica's career, even though Reload isn't no better. So much crappy songs on here with 4 or 5 good ones. Until it sleeps, Hero of the day, king nothing, cure, thorn within, and Outlaw Torn, are sweet tracks, but the rest suck. I thought the house jack built was Metallicas worst song ever. The vocal solo is so stupid, and the lyrics suck. Mama said and bleeding me are ok. Get AJFA, RTL, KEA, and MOP before this one, yikes."
5,Only one trouble with this album,"I think both Load and Re load are great albums. The groove and the lyrics are great (Hetfield's eternal struggle with his inner demons). But the problem is the band's past. They had great albums before this one, and the obvious tendency is to compare them to these. Every artist MUST change, because mantaining as ther were is a sign of mediocricy(I dont't know if is spelled like this).This is a GREAT album"
4,Not as good as Reload,"This is a relly great and underated album, it may not be as good as Reload but this is a great album none the less. 'Until It Sleeps' is with out a doubt the best song on the album. This is a strong and concistant album and I know its not Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning but this is really a good album. It has hard tracks, and great riffs and solos, and Hetfields voice sounds great. This may not be the fastest Metallica album but is still great none the less, but falls short of Reload."
1,Piece of Garbage,"A low life in the discology of a once great, ok, almost great, band. You want real metal, go with Metallica's old nemisis, Megadeth. They SOLD OUT!!! Enough Said."
2,What is this @#%&????,"O.K., boys, nice try, but for making your fans wait so long only to put out this?? It's not metal, it's alternative!! It may be very good, especially compared to the rest of todays music, but it is just not what everyone was expecting."
1,I am being extroadinarily polite - YUCK,"I wasn't *real* impressed with the Black Album, but even low expectations didn't prepare me for the abysmal depths reached in ""Load."" Let me say something nice before I go on a tirade. There is absolutely no doubting the musical virtuosity of this band. And yes, groups do grow older, mature, and change style. But sometimes this process leaves their old fans in the dust.I dusted myself off and endured a round of ""Load."" Overall, I'd say Metallica most reminded me of one of those early 80's Led Zep rip off bands (can you say Whitesnake?). Yeah, musically they're more complex, and they do show flashes of brilliance, but it's buried under a Load of crud. Those wimpy intros had me screaming, ""Would something on this album PLEASE rock???"". The songs are long, self indulgent, and lyrically vapid. But hey - if you like this version of Metallica - take it - please. And spare me Reload."
1,"Who are you guys, and what did you do with Metallica?","Why can't I choose 0 stars? This CD is just plain horrible, although not as bad as Reload. The self-titled album was the beginning of the end. This is not Metallica. ...And Justice for All and Master of Puppets is what Metallica is all about. They have sold out and gone trendy. This CD is worthless. The only bright spot is the songs ""I'm Bleeding Me"" and ""Hero of the Day""."
2,If you start here you won't be disappointed....,"but if you're like me and have been listening to metallica for 20 years or so this is complete garbage compared to other releases. If somebody else would have released this record I would of liked it much more but I feel it did not live up to Metallica's standard of greatness. So, if you start with Load and you like that, then get Reload then the Black record and work your way into the older stuff. And Justice for all, Ride the lightning, and Master of Puppets are must owns' this record is not. If your looking for And justice For All again or the Black record skip this. Thanks for your time and enjoy the ride."
4,It's good!,"Yes, I gave St. Anger one star. But as for Load - I don't think it's bad, there are many tracks I enjoy! And I'm not going to downvote the album because it's not metal."
2,What's the deal with the math?,"Um, this album WAS a sell-out. That's like trying to argue Saddam Hussein is not guilty. It's sell-out, face it. Is it thrash? No. It's sell-out. It's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing, (...). Let's call it for what it is.Why the 2 stars? I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc. etc. etc. These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.(...)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play. Shame on them. This band died with Cliff."
3,Good but get rid of rock,When metallica had bob rock produce the black album and they put out a masterpiece. And then they thought that they could do it again by putting that old fart back on the producing this album. Now this album isn't that bad. Hero of the day and outlaw torn are actully pretty cool songs. In fact this is way better than st. anger.But this isn't metallica with the long hair or with the hard riffs that they had on the old albums. It's more bluesy or mixed with some kind of metal but I'm not sure. But please metallica get rid of bob rock. Ever since he came he put you guys in this mess. It's like he wants you guys to be soft. He dosn't want you guys making another ride the lighting of master of puppets. When you guys put out another album I hope it is without bob and it is back in the hands of the four guys that knew metal. Please metallica for your fans.
4,Good album,"Ok, here is how I see it, metallica was experimenting with this one, if you like the black album, but not their older stuff, you may like Load and Reload, though alot of there old fans dislike the change in their style, I like it. I can't get enough Hero Of The Day and Bleeding Me, not to mention the awsome Until It Sleeps, Don't get the idea that it's better than the black album. Even the people I know who hate Metallica admit liking The Black Album."
2,This Is A Load Of Something,"I'm not going to rant about Metallica selling ou, but I am going to tell you that this album mostly sucks.Good Songs: King NothingOK Songs: Hero Of The Day and Ain't My BitchBad Songs: Everything ElseKing Nothing is the closest to any of their old stuff so you might want to have a listen."
2,it's O.K.,"ho-hum. just O.K. nothing new or special. that's why i have a problem with it. it bores me. it's fine for playing at work as background music that coworkers might like, but that's about it."
2,this cd sucks,worst metallica cd.....when cliff died they defintly changed i think.....im only into the old stuff so i dont really like this cd
1,Time for a name change,"Maybe they didn't sell out, but Metallica is certainly no longer metal. I think a name change is in line: Bluesica"
1,THEIR WORST CD,...and yet.The band sucks and not even a single good track or two will save them.NOT EVEN ONE.They suck!
1,Diarrhea For The Ears,"If you love radio-rock, you'll love this album. This is weak even compared to the Black album. And the Black album was weak compared to Metallica's four previous albums."
1,Horrible,"Just a horrible album if you like the old material. It is a rock album and does not even come close to a metal album. If you want to hear real metal, hear SLAYER!"
3,okay (3.5 stars),"acuctually to be honest, i AM kinda disappointed in this album. when a new band puts out one like this, u'll go crazy over it, but here we're talkin about metallica. so i'm kinda disappointed. but it's still worth buyin. cuz some of the songs here r pretty good, (...) bleeding me, etc.i recommend RELOAD."
4,Load a pretty good album,"Load, id haft to say this album is a lot different than there previous albums. But hey they been out for a few years. James just happened to lose a little bit of the music. And for the people who dont like it, take my advice listen to the album over and over and the great vocals and instruments will catch ya. I give it 4 stars because its not greatest album, but its got some good songs on it, so go out and buy it."
4,more actually 4 1/2 stars---very good album!!!,"the reason i don't give it a full 5 stars is because this album is not as catchy as their older stuff. but that does not mean that this album sucks. in fact, it is the opposite. this album still has a lot of depth musically. ain't my bi!$h is a raw, aggressive opener, perhaps not the best guitar solo but still the song really flows. until it sleeps is an example of a classic song from metallica. they still have shown that they can still make classics in the past 10 years through this album. how about hero of the day? this is my personal favorite, flows really well from being a slow melodic song into a faster groove. this album is much better than reload, every song is very good. heck even the songs which are almost 10 minutes long seem to go by. why? because they were masterfully orchestrated and timed to make them flow effortlessly.metallica is the best!!!!"
2,Definately not there best.,"I have to say, I was disappointed with this album, I only like maybe 2 of the songs included on it. I really prefered the ""older"" Metallica. It really doesn't compared to Cd's like ""And Justice for All"" or ""Master of Puppets""."
2,Mediocre at best,"The tracks aren't actually all that bad, it's the album as a whole. Load's rather choppy, it switches styles too often, going from fast to slow to thrash to glam to etc. etc... also, I personally think it's way too long. 14 tracks isn't that much, but it just seemed overwhelming. I guess they were just out of practice after 5 years, but they really could have done better. The only really outstanding tunes were Wasting My Hate, Thorn Within, and Hero of the Day. Good thing I got it used and only spent $4.99 on it."
4,Until It Sleeps Until It Sleeps Until It Sleeps,"""Ain't My Bitch"" and ""Until It Sleeps"" are ultimate songs from a great album. This album has heaps of good songs, but lacks good songs after ""Bleeding Me"". Hammet displays his brilliance in ""Thorn Within"" and Hetfield screaming the strong lyrics in ""Until It Sleeps"". Like this??? then get RELOAD too."
4,a great prequal to reload,i dont think of this cd being the start of the load cds i bought reload first and like it more this one wasnt as enjoyable as its sequal either aint my bitch is probably the best song on this cd
1,Total Sell Out since Burton Died,"If you started listening to Metallica post Black Album, you may like this album and all similar to it. I'm from the fan base that started listening to the group with Kill Em All. I can't stand the new stuff they are doing.I'm so disappointed, I can't even begin to explain. If they could get a bass player with the same energy and feel that Cliff Burton had, maybe they could redeem themselves.It's not any different than the rest of the industry I guess. Everyone has sold out, died or just suck now... Megadeath, Testament, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest... At least Slayer is trying to maintain their roots.Come on Metallica, do something for the old fans at lease once!!!!!!!"
2,Meh,"Didn't live up to my expectations. I love the earlier albums, but I feel like they've gone off on a tangent and lost some of what I love about their music. It started with the Black album and continued here. I really hope they get back whatever they lost, this just doesn't get me rockin' like their other albums."
1,One word.......,METALLICRAP. It's time to admit it folks. What was once the mightiest band in the world now unquestionably sucks and worst of all they can't even see it. They can say anything they want about changing with the times and not wanting to produce the same album over and over again. The fact is that they were in a perfect position to be LEADING the trends but instead they chose to be followers. That is unforgivable.
3,great album if anyone else had made it,"Okay, I'm going through the inevitable re-assessment of Metallica's catalog that comes with every new album. With Load, I have the same opinion that I did ten years ago: if this album had been made by anyone else, it would have been hailed as a great ROCK album. Problem is, Metallica spent all those years putting out truly epic, towering songs. After their 1st four albums (lets just ignore BLACK) anything other than truly legendary thrash built on mathematically precise, wonderfully layered foundations sounds weak and pathetic.The songs on this album are good. I spent a lot of time listening to it and still go back every once in a while. I, like everyone else (or at least everyone who was around for the old stuff and has good taste) would have preferred MORE of the old sounding stuff. That being said, what's here is good music and should be judged on it's own merits rather than being trashed because of what its not."
2,Lame as* detour off the metal highway.,"I will keep this simple. Metallica still shows decent musicianship, but no balls, no passion no real OOMPH. I love all kinds of music and I dont just hate the change in musical direction. Its a little deeper than that. Just listen to the first disc of Garage days especially the songs that were the 5.98 E.P. revisited. This is the music they cut theyre teeth on the music that helped them define theyre own sound and intensity. When you listen to most of the newer stuff it is clear that they are what, wimping out getting old who knows all I know Is I have been playing Guitar for over 17 years and I do listen to loads of music but my first loves are metal and punk and I cant see that ever changing."
5,Great album,"This is really a great CD, and a great example of Metallica's talent and diversity. I recommend this CD to not only metal fans, but to those of genres, because it has a mixed variety of sounds incorporated into one album."
5,UG! Im tired of this crap! Not a bad album!,"I love Metallica, i have all of thier albums, yes even St. Anger. While St. Anger is not good, Load and Re-Load are not bad albums. Many people would prefer that Metallica had stayed the same and kept rehashing thier old stuff. Load and Re-Load are NOT heavy metal like thier older albums and the songs aren't 9 minute metal epics. These two albums have a darker, mellower, more Alternative feel to them while maintaining Metallica's signature sound. I can understand how a narrowminded ""heavy metal only"" person couldn't accept these albums, but people with a taste for all kinds of rock music, be it punk, metal, alternative, grunge, etc. should be able to appreciate these two albums for what they are, genuinely GOOD albums!"
1,Lyrics. The Achilles heel for modern Metallica.,"Seemingly plagued by a sudden and jarring loss of ambition, Metallica indulges full-fledge in its own overblown excesses while abandoning any semblance of intellect in its songwriting. ""Ain't My Bitch"" is a song straight from the Metallica men's willies into the speaker, with no cranial interruption. Unfortunately, that is not songwriting is about. So all that's left is a good Bob Rock mix and some loud, meaty guitars that have no real songs to support (hence, useless). The sonics of the album drew me in upon first listen at the record store. My brain complained when I played the CD at home, and I haven't touched it since.Metallica has died. Or, at the very least, its sense of shame."
1,Bleahhh...,"It's a pity that Metallica will not be remembered as the best band of the 80s, but rather as the band that perpetrated the worst sellout in musical history. Despite what the MTV-watching hordes will tell you, this sure is a Load.If you go to a Metallica concert and it starts to rain, that's just Cliff Burton pissing on his betrayers from above."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,"This band continues to evolve and whever thinks this album is bad needs to be shot. What are we going to have speed metal forever? IDIOTS say yes. This was the best album in my opinion that Metallica ever did. Bluesy and musical. Not just noise. Bleeding me is the best song they EVER did and the sound in general on this album (and RELOAD too) needs to be revisited after the disappointment of St. Anger. There is more to do in this genre for Metallica, simple as that!"
3,Thrash no more,"This album is proof that money, success, and easy living can completly kill the Godfathers of thrash metal. This album is barely even metal. AS good as many of the songs are, and the material is still better than 90% of the bands out there, the speed with which they move shows that Metallica have completely lost the edge that took them to the top. I'm reminded of Apollo Creed saying to Rocky that 'Its the eye of the tiger.' I listen to this record a lot, because its a very good rock record, just not the thrash that makes Kill'em All, Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets absolute must records for metal lovers."
1,Alternica,"The worst Metallica album to date. Even the album's sequel Reload is better than this! If you like The Cranberries, or Radiohead, then this album is for you, but if you like Megadeth or Anthrax, skip this one."
2,I gave this album away...,"When I first listened to Load, I was expecting to hear some great stuff after hearing ""And Justice for All"" and the Black album, but I was GREATLY disappointed, so much so, that I gave it away to someone who has a taste for that Alternacrap. There must be a connection... Anyway, if you want good material, buy ANY Metallica album prior to this one. This album is just a little bit better than Re-Load, the best songs (IMO) are: King Nothing and 2x4. If you like that basic, rocky kinda sound, get this one, otherwise go for albums from the real Metallica years (1983-1996). C'mon Metallica, put the ""METAL"" back in ""METALLICA""!"
4,Not like Puppets?? no kidding mate,"The transition between Justice and Black was much greater than between Black and Load. In all fairness, the album isn't bad and it shows that bands can evolve and do the 180. However, people who reckon they sold out with this one are wrong. If they ever sold out, it was when they released the black album. New producer, shorter less complex songs, softer more simplistic drumming and not really any lyrical vengeance was associated with that album, Load is just inevitable follow up to it.Now really, Black is when they changed, forget the hair, and all the makeup in the booklet and stuff, they changed when they released black, an album caught in a bluesy/older style time warp. Load, suprisingly more musical then black, is just the washup that had to happen."
2,it sucks,"Metallica's older stuff is a lot better, because it is a lot more raw and heavier. This record does not do them justice(no pun intended). I feel that even the record from '91 is a lot better than this record."
1,EXACTLY what the title says...,"Load is a load of... Such a bad album. How can a bunch of talented musicians go from rock to suck so quickly? No, it's not because they cut their hair. It's because James Hetfield decided to try to sing (which he can't) and the band ran out of things to say. Say they sold out if you must, I don't care about their politics. I'd still listen to 'em if they had a shred of talent anymore. They don't, and it's a crying shame for the former kings to have gone Fat Old Elvis so quickly."
4,Personal Preference is EVERYTHING.,"Hi,I got this album a while ago, back when it first came out, and i'd agree with most 1 and 2 star reviews that it was a horrible album. But over the years I've come to like it a lot. With songs like ""King Nothing"", ""Until it Sleeps"", and ""Ronnie"", I don't see how people cant like this album. I'm an old-school fan of Metallica, I have Kill Em' All on Vinyl, and it's a great album, and i think that ""Load"" is a great addition to my collection, and it fits along with every other 'tallica album.In conclusion, It's a pretty good album, so i'd recommend it to any metallica fan who doesn't care if they've changed over the years, Metallica is one of the greatest metal bands in the world, and it'd be a shame not to have All of their albums to listen to all of their great songs.-Walt"
3,Some Good Stuff,"Now to look back on the CD I feel that it's not the best thing they put out but it's what they wanted to do. There's several great songs on this CD. Bleeding Me was engraved in my mind from the 2 local stations but recently I heard it for the first time in a few years and loved it.While I may not always like the music direction Metallica takes, its the direction they wish to take and I respect them more for doing what they want and not what the ""whinning"" few that call them sell-outs want.The only reason Cliff would roll over in his grave is because of the respect they currently get from those who once said they were fans. Cliff listened to a lot of diverse music growing up and no matter what others may want to think, he would have also wanted to ""grow"" and not be stuck in the same old grind for 20 years!"
1,Its a Load alright!,I'd give this album 0 stars if I could. This alternative/country/ rock album goes way off the tracks at the beginning and has the distinction of being on of the few albums that makes me physically ill.AJR
2,This is THE WORST METALLICA ALBUM,"Only reason I gave it two stars is cause it's Metallica. Whatever happen the songwriting from And Justice for All, Master of Puppets, or even The Black Album?"
1,Metallica is DEAD,Metallica died with Cliff Burton. This is watered down RADIO GARBAGE. Where is the musical debth of Orion or the ballsy Damage Inc. Cliff is turning over in his grave
4,A change in pace...,"...OK so some fans were a little dissapointed about this, but lets face it, if ANY band releases the same music over and over agian, no matter what guise it may be in, the monotony is bound to drive people away. I feel that Metallica made a wise decision in taking a slightly different route.So what about the album? Until it sleeps and Hero of the Day are my personal faves although there is nothing on this album that I did not like. It does lack some the edge of previous albums but this is replaced by a depth which breaths in new life. Mama Said is probably the best example of this.If you are expecting more of the same then this album is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for something a bit different then here it is. Either way, you should at least give this album a chance, it IS good!"
2,this is metallica?,"I must say that while I don't think Metallica sold out, I do however, feel that this cd is a bunch of crap. I loved there cd before load (even though it was a little different from their previous recordings), and all there other cd's. One reason why I don't like this cd is it contains nothing that made me like Metallica in the first place, i.e double-bass drum, hard-headbanging riffs, heavy bass, amazing solo's, excellent lyrics etc... Until It Sleeps, King Nothing are decent songs but they pale in comparison to any other song Metallica has put out. Bottom Line-Only buy it if you collect Metallica cd's or if you didn't like there other cd's, then and only then will you like this cd."
2,The worst?,"No, for me Reload is worst, but Load will never be a classical album like Ride ,'Master' or even the 'Black album' because there's no really good song. There is no 'Fade to black', 'Enter sandman', 'The four horsemen', 'Battery' etc ... For me take 'Bleeding me' and 'The outlaw torn' and that's all"
4,"Not the best metallica album, but it's still awesome","Well, load is a different direction for the horsemen, but hey, i don't blame 'em for mixing it up a bit. Wouldn't you get tired of playing the same style of music for 15 years? Their music still rocks, though jaymz's singing isn't the stereotypical screaming anymore. 2x4 and King Nothing rock, although don't expect the same amazing technical skill you saw on the 80's albums. People complain about the lack of double bass drum on this album, but the two bass drums still make an appearance at every live show. Although some of the songs are more spooky than rockin', the only album i like more than this one is ...And Justice for All. Don't listen to the bashing! They didn't sell out, they reinvented."
4,Experimenting...but still decent,"Metallica seems to have gone a different direction, and although this album doesn't compare with The Black Album or Justice is still good in its own right. The lyrics are more personal, and meaningful, while the music lacks a bit of the usual fire/passion.Nevertheless, The Outlaw Torn is a classic. So is Until It Sleeps, and possibly Bleeding Me. If you're wondering whether to buy this or RELOAD, don't think twice: Get it. It's the last decent album Metallica is going to put. Seems like it..."
1,NOT METALLICA!!!!!!!,This CD has to be the biggest pice of sh*t i have ever heard in my entire life. I am a die hard Metallica fan and saw them live not to long ago. They didn't play anything off this CD so the must think its f*cking sucks to. WHAT HAPPEND TO THE GOOD OLD METALLICA!!!!!
2,"Dear God, make it stop","Metallica continues its quest to reach new listeners and ""broaden its musical palate."" Meanwhile, longtime fans can only shake their heads in pity at the second-rate boogie rock and Danzig-wannabe posturing on ""Load."" Trying to listen to Metallica swing its way through midtempo and slow songs is nothing short of sheer torture. With each track, I have to scream ""Faster, play it faster!"" Nowhere is this more apparent than on ""Bleeding Me,"" which keeps threatening to turn into another classic like ""One,"" until it runs out of steam toward its finale.Yes, it's fine if musicians expand upon their sound. We encourage it. But when a metal band starts convincing itself that it's the heir to the Allman Brothers, then they need to be set aright."
4,Not so bad.,"Aint my B****-- This is a cool song! 4/52x4-- great! 4/5house that jack built-- keep it up! 5/6Until it Sleeps-- the best song here!!! 4/4king nothing-- AWESOME! 5/5Hero of the Day-- peesacrap 0/4Bleeding me-- cool, kinda long 6/8cure-- excellente 4/4poor twisted me-- what were they goin for here?? 1/4wasting my hate-- its pretty cool... 2/3Mama said-- ayayayay, no way! 0/5thorn within-- too long for such a small song. 3/5Ronnie-- it actually sounds coooel. 5/5the outlaw thorn-- whats with all these thorns??? 8/9so the full points would be 72... this gets 51.51/72... not bad at all. reminds me of my grades in school or sumtin."
4,Not bad but I expected more,"If you listen to every album from Kill to the black album then you would know that this album with ReLoad is different. However my response regarding Load and ReLoad is not negative. Its not as powerful as their previous LP's but its still has some of that trade mark Metallica sound. I think what Metallica did here was to attract new fans but for someone like me who has been a fan for about 11 years, it was hard at first to grip this album. Eventually I grew on to it instead of bashing it. Overall its not a bad album if you think about it. It could of been worse the band could've put out a folk or country album. Metallica will always be the greatest band on this planet along with Megadeth,Iron Maiden, Anthrax, Ozzy solo/Black Sabbath/AC/DC/Led Zeppelin/Judas Priest, Pantera, Alice in Chains, Sepultura, Soundgarden, Slayer, Fear Factory, Faith no More, Korn, Deftones, Rage against the Machine, Punk and Blues music."
2,"Between 2 and 3 stars, more veering towards 2","well, this album isn't NEARLY as Metallic as others, but it's still decent music if you forget who wrote it.... people say Metallica sold out. my reply to that is, Metallica didn't sell out, they changed their style..I must say I was VERY disappointed with Load, so much so that I didn't buy it. I did however buy ReLOAD, for one song, Fuel.While this album does not scream sell-out, it doesn't scream metal either."
4,55-year-old rocker likes this album,"How's that for shocking, kids? These guys have indeed grown up. Nice chops & lyrics too. And Ulrich is one of the few Danes with a rockin' bone in his body."
2,Most dissapointing record of all time,"The ""Black album"" was a big step towards ""mainstream music"", but it stayed pretty much inside the metal genre. All bands at some point tend to experiment with other styles, and the result of that is almost the same everytime. Metallica's case is a little bit complex. They went through a whole change, and the most impressing was the change of look. The photos in the booklet, tha hair cuts, i have nothing against that. But it shocked everybody. For old metallica fans..with their high-mental-inertia the change was too much, and the sold out was finally completed.All of the speed is lost, and their solos too.The album has a good song, though:Until It Sleeps."
1,LOAD WHAT ????,"If you like this, you have nto heard MASTER OF PUPPETS or RIDE THE LIGHTNING or even AN JUSTICE FOR ALL. I'm not saying a band can change or try new approaches. Not at all. I'm just saying that, when doing so, one must feel that they are doing it with their hearts, and the new music don't loss force or spirit. But both are lacking in LOAD. It seems a band who has never played metal before."
2,+++ LOAD of CRAP!! +++,"I am a hardcore MetallicA fan and i can tell you that this is not MetallicA, this is Metallica trying to keep up with other bands and updated metal. They cut their hair, started wearing make up, and playing blues style rock while drinkin martini's instead of an old fashioned beer can, get me? Load is different in deed, too different. All though they did surprise me with a few good songs such as ''Hero of the Day,King Nothing,Until it Sleeps, and Bleeding Me (The best one on the album). Im not angry or hate them for it, im just not used to it, but still it's Metallica and it was just a fase. Buy this at a yard sale or flea market for cheap, dont pay the full price."
1,"Should Change their Name to ""Popica""","I must say that the downturn for Metallica began with the Black Album. The intensity and high voltage sound was pretty much dying on that album. But now, this isn't even the same group. I could care less if they decided to take their music in a ""new"" direction. But they should change their name. They are no longer a metal band. They are a pop band. Plain and simple. This belongs next to the Barry Manilow cds.We metal fans will just have to stick with Cannibal Corpse and Slayer. Which is fine with me, they both rock."
1,They got the title right....,"This album is garbage. Sellout pop metal, radio crap from these former thrash giants. Im glad after the s&itbombs load, re-load and S&M we got a solid album like St. Anger and Death Magnetic to put Metallica in the right direction again."
1,Pathetic,"THIS is where Metallica took a wrong turn off the Kick Ass highway. (They SHOULD have taken that left turn at Albuquerque) It would be hard to list everything that is wrong with this album.The hair.The makeup.The videos.Ths songs.The LACK of lyrics that mean anything.Lars.James.Kirk.Jason.Semen on the cover.Lars.You get the picture. Metallica sold their soul with ...And Justice for All. The cut hair was a symbol of the loss of bollucks. It was a sign of things to come, a sign of things that ceased to be.Smeared semen on the cover? I see Lars finally got his way."
1,WHAT THE F*********K!,"THIS IS PURE S##T. THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS CD IS ""UNTIL IT SLEEPS"" THE ONLY GOOD SONG. THE REST IS PURE CRAP. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER METALLICA. PASS LOAD AND RELOAD. ITS NOT WORTH ONE F**KING CENT."
2,I had a dream the other day...,"...It was about the old Metallica meeting the new greedy b**ta**s. The younger James said to the older one ""how could you let me turn into you?"" and continued to toss a match onto his gel-ridden hair and watch him explode. The mullet Lars Ulrich beat up the greedy one, and then pissed on him. Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted teamed up with Kirk Hammetts younger self and threw the older Hammett off of a cliff. Megadeth Mustaine and Metallica Mustaine just stood there and laughed, while Slayer and Anthrax cried at the fact that a once musically beautiful and talented band had turned into a bunch of money-hungry f**ks!(this dream was TOO true)Well, I guess that 'Aint My B**ch' and 'King Nothing' are decent songs, but the rest is crap and proves how lazy Metallica became."
1,"Forget Metallica, go buy Mayhem instead","Metallica's first 4 albums are the best (ahhh the good old '80s). Forget anything that came after it - I believe drinking too much alcohol has killed most of their brain cells. Now if you are looking for 21st century thrash then try Mayhem -their latest album ""Chimera"" is utterly brutal."
2,Oh how the mighty have fallen,"No, Metallica did not sell out. They merely changed their style at a time when everyone else was doing the same thing, nothing to get in a stink over. But, it sucks. They tried to change their style like everyone else and they failed miserably. This is a ridiculously overrated album and I'm just glad that most of my friends who once liked it are finally coming around."
3,Its not a bad album,"Its not a bad album. The songs are pretty good...but what happened to metallica? I loved the kicking speedy guitar riffs and Lars Ulrich's amazing drumming. None of that is really present in this album. The drumming could have been done by any drummer, and the music had a far more poppy, post grungey feeling to it. Its not metal. A band with the name metallica should be a metal band. Thats how I feel."
2,Metallica without ideas,"They should have taken time off. Spent some time in rehab or just wait for musical inspiration. And I think I am being generous by giving 2 stars. If it were not for the song Hero of The Day, this would be ONE star."
1,THE MEMORY INDEED REMAINS,"Load is an attempt to stray away from a style that made Metallica famous amongst those of us who were nobody, those of us who fought through High School as nobodies but had this great band, and the few of us that were nobodies fought together, with old school Metallica, it meant so much to us.Albums like Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning are untoppable; I think the worst thing a band can do is press forward with mainstream garbage. A collection of poorly designed rythms, and while the lyrics might be pretty good, who cares. The lust is gone.I thank Metallica for the tough years they helped myslf and my friends through, its payed off. But Im in complete disgust with their last ten years and I learn a new lesson from it: STICK TO YOUR GUNS."
1,I happened to be...,"cruising regular radio today and one of the stations was Lite FM (just by the title you can tell what type of music it is) and I heard a song titled Mama Said. The voice sounded VERY FAMILIAR! When the song ended and by Metallica, I knew I was done! The last GOOD Metallica cd was.. well, you know. Cliff needs to be resurrected and whip the 3 horsemen back into shape! Long Live Cliff!NO STARS FOR ME!"
1,Slow & weak,"I totally disagree with the reviews that claim how ""nice"" and ""cute"" heavy metal should be. The FIRST lesson to know about heavy metal is that this music is played fast. This music is energizing, blazing and filled with riffs, except the ballads, of course, which are played by their own atmospheric tunes. However, Load lacks any kind of heavy metal riffs and tunes which are defined way beyond in the beginning of 70's by the bands like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. I request fans of Metallica, especially the new ones who don't know anything about the history of heavy metal, to respect this music and not associate the after ""Black"" era materials of Metallica with it. There are LOTS of differences between Southern Boogie Rock and Heay Metal.A few spins of Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" (1970) or Judas Priest's ""Defenders of the Faith"" (1984) against ""Load"" should be enough to present you the difference."
1,I hate it when this happens...,"Am I the only one who thinks these guys are gay? Is that their new target audience? Wearing makeup has a different meaning in the 90's than it did in the 80's. This is not some 'inspirational' turn in their career, it is the sound of old guys who need to give up or at least change the name of the band. I hate it when bands (and shows) get run into the ground. It's better to die with pride and just stop making albums. I feel sorry for Cliff, he must be in Hell."
4,This is a great ROCK album....,".....not a METAL album, but a ROCK album.Problem with a lot of hardcore metalheads is that they can't venture out of their narrow views, and I say that as someone who has been a Metal fan for many years, but not ONLY a metal fan.The album is a bit too long, some more quality control could have been exercised and it would have been a 5-star 60-minute album.No, it's no Master of Puppets, but it's not meant to be !"
4,IT AIN'T TOO BAD...,"It wasn't what I expected at first, but it tends to grow on you. From the haunting melodies of ""Until it Sleeps"" to the rocking of ""King Nothing"" Load is a good CD."
5,THE BEST METALLICA CD EVER RELEASED!,"This is simply an incredible CD. It contains my favorite Metallica song, ""King Nothing,"" plus the hits ""Until It Sleeps,"" ""Ain't My Bitch,"" ""Bleeding Me,"" and ""Hero Of The Day."" There is not one bad song on this CD, and it's definitly worth getting."
3,I want the old Metallica back!,"Where are the good old days of real kick-*** Metallica heavy metal! Since the Black album they have been going downhill (I suppose it is because they've cut their hair). C'mon guys, I'm sure you can still do it!"
4,Alternica,"Metallica sorta lost their metal edge with this one... Don't get me wrong, it is a great CD but more chill than we are used to from the band."
1,Cow semen in blood?,"Bad album, bad cover. This signified the end for Jason Newsted. I don't blame him one bit. The heaviest band on the planet with a cover of cow semen in blood? I know, it's not about that, it's about the music. So let's get into it. THIS IS TERRIBLE! Yes I understand growth but c'mon. The real problem isn't the haircuts or any of that crap. IT'S BOB ROCK! He needs to go. He ruined a great band. Anyone who loves this cd probably jumped on the wagon after the Black album. Well posers, stay on the wagon. You'll find me listening to Kill-Ride-Puppets-Justice-Music that still holds up today."
1,Load of S#@!,"I was a fan prior to the black album though I don't go back as far as some die hards. My favorite album of theirs was always ""Master of Puppets"" I enjoyed the ""black"" album. I have TRIED repeatedly to enjoy this album. They've changed, I've changed, and it just isn't working anymore. I found nothing inspirational in this album. It was boring and flat. Bob Rock works well for a band like Motley Crue; he's screwed up Metallica. I was genuinely excited about the release until I got home and put it in the CD player. That was when my smile went away. I just wasn't feeling it. It felt childish, trendy, artificial. These weren't angry boys with a social conscience anymore; they turned into the pop-metal bands they claimed to have despised. If that's what they want to be then so be it. I've said my goodbyes and won't be spending another dollar on any new Metallica releases..."
2,What the hell happened?!,"In my book, this is not the best Metallica album, probably one of their worst. The best are Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning. There are some good, memorable songs on this album, but the rest are dead ends. The bluesy thing would be ok if they kept it like the Black album, but in here it sounds almost like country music. The album gets boring if you listen through and this is where Metallica loses its reputation of being a heavy and fast thrash metal band. Lyrically, it's horrible. On some songs it's like James isn't even trying, like on Bleeding Me. The guitar work is good, but the riffs and solos aren't too exciting. The drumming is the least of what Lars can do and Jason, as always, is practically shunned out. It just amazes me how they could make the greatest metal album of all time (Puppets) and then turn into this nonsense. This isn't real Metallica music. This isn't even metal."
1,This album sucks...,"we all know that already. I just bought it for ""Until it Sleeps"" to put on the mp3. Disc was just as cheap as a download."
4,Good Album,"I didn't grow up with Metallica so I guess I had the benefit of not being shocked by such a different sound compared to their older stuff. I slowly collected all their albums a few years ago, and I think too many di-hards come down on this album, along with reload. Load is a great album, and while its a pretty a big transition from the past, it's still Metallica at heart. Wasted My Hate, King Nothing, and Bleeding Me are my favorites. Lots of bands just regurgitate the same music with every new album...god forbid they try something new."
2,I Think I Made A Load In My Pants,Two stars for Ain't My B*tch & Wasting My Hate. The rest I can live without.
4,Who?,"Hey now, this album isint that bad...if this cd came out under some new anonomus (cant spel) name, hell I would still buy it!...Now this isint the Metallica everyone onced loved, its different, but yeah its good.1.

5,dont like it then your dumb,this is a great album with blues influence i garuntee im the biggest metallifan on this site and this is not as good as the older more agressive albums but when im not in the mood to thrash i put this album in because it helps me relax and those of you who say metallica sold out your right every night they play they are sold out because of loyal fans like me they are the best band in the world and i garuntee that the next album will be better than slayers christ illusion (man they are to old for the satan thing) because i like all the albums (even st.anger) and they will always rule for they are the gods of all music!!!!!!!
1,come on,"stay away from this album. and stay away from the black album, stay away from reload, st anger, and the new that came out, i dont even know the name hahaha"
1,If only there was no star,The only reason I am giving this one 1 star is because that is the lowest it goes. Now don't lission to what anyone else has said on here about this cd. It sucks!!!!! THis is one the worst cds I have ever herd by metallica well this and reload and there verson of Misfits. If like real metal then don't get this one. Get old metallica like anything before the black cd. Well S&M was ok the newest cd St. whatever is better then this crap. What where you thinking Metallica and the rest of you people for saying buy this what are you smoking crack or like 10 or somthing. Get over it Metallica is dead musicly. You know who has never changed Slayer and they came out the same time as Metallica and has alwas keep it hard. If you are looking for a old band that still rock pick up anything by slayer. Because Slayer fans would kill metallica fans even one of the members of metallica said this. So leave metallica alone and go with Slayer. Hail SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Wha, wha ha happened? Where's Metallica?","To everyone that expected Black Album II, you were in for a rude awakening. Metallica has changed on this album, and it is a far cry from everything else they have done. If a different band recorded this I would think that they did a decent job. The tracks are still heavy, but not nearly as fast as the way I like my metal. The songs also sound somewhat like blues, and have lost some edge. And what happened to the metal ideology? Grow your hair as long as it goes and play the loudest rudest angriest music ever? I must admit that I like this album, but I did something on it I have never done with a Metallica CD. I skipped tracks. I suppose it is selfish of me to want every song to be my favorite, but it felt wrong.This had to be expected. When a band puts out so much great music like Led Zeppelin did, you have to expect that at some point they will start to decline."
4,"Metallica never sold out, and never will!","Ok, the bottom line, I got a haircut at the mall yesterday. Did I sell out, no I didn't! So just because METALLICA got hair cuts and changed their sound of music, no, let me changed that, just because they got haircuts and matured their music does not mean they sold out. They are some great songs on Load, trust me its worth the money because you know something, Metallica never sold out, and they never will. And don't bother to look for my review for Re-load, it would just be the same."
1,This is a load...,Metallica should change their name to Pop Musica. I'm just waiting for them to release an album of Hanson and Jewel cover songs.
1,Waste of money,"Nothing like to forget to play music and do what the market wants. Metallica is the best example of contradiction. I, as an old ex-fan, remember very well the words of James saying ""Image is nothing for us, what matters is music!!"". Today this should be changed to ""Image is everything for us, music is nothing!!"". After this, I need to say nothing about the record. Oh, there is just one music worth listening, ""Bleeding Me"". The rest is garbage."
1,Bob Rock Killed Metallica,Before you buy this cd or any Metallica CD. LOOK ON THE BACK AND SEE IF BOB ROCK PRODUCED IT. If he did it's a LOAD OF S#@T. DO NOT BUY IT. The only exception is the Black Album. And even on that one they started to go soft on us.
2,Will the real Metallica please stand up?,"I bought this album when it first came out, and I had to check the cover to make sure it said Metallica. Although I didn't expect another ""Puppets"" record, I thought that they'd atleast try. As a metal fan I wouldn't suggest it,I will say that for those radio happy fans should appreciate the hard rock style."
2,not my metallica,"this isn't my metallica. metallica have turned into tired old men looking for something different to play for money. sure there are a few catchy hard rock songs on the album but i don't really think its worth buying. master of puppets is ten times better than this, don't get me wrong i don't hate metallica because they went in a softer direction with the music but i hate what they turned into. its pretty obvious that they completely abandoned their roots and turned radio friendly to become more popular. i would have rather seen them retire after the black album."
1,Smell,These guys just plain old rot anymore. Lars should star in a remake of Gomer Pyle. The Black album was bad enuff. This is worseOUT
1,Nooooooo!,"The first Metallica song I ever heard in my life was Until It Sleeps. I was expecting something fast and heavy hence the name METALlica. Instead, I heard Alternative rock similar to Bush. If they want to make this type of music then the least they could do is change their name because this does not represent metallica. I later bought Kill 'Em All and I heard a totally different sound. Please don't buy this album or Reload. However, I DID enjoy both discs in Garage Inc."
1,horrible,"this album stinks, the whole second side is bad. only two good songs on here ""until it sleeps, and hero of the day"". All you metallica fans have alot to learn about music because this is bad."
2,crap,"james voice is horrible. It's been high pitched and squeeky since the black album tour, dont believe me just check out the live s*** box set and listen. He tries to hard to ""sing"" and in turn ends up signing off key and what not. The cd has 2 maybe 3 songs on it that are worth listening to. Bleeding Me is one of the best songs they've wrote, hands down. I love it. But some of the other material they put on this cd is pure utter crap"
3,Too Much Filler,"Some of the songs on this album are good, and I dont want to get into how Metallica should go back to their old ways. But Until it Sleeps, Bleeding Me, Hero of the Day, Outlaw Torn, and Mama Said are actually decent songs.The rest of the album is almost all filler. This album should have been trimmed down to like 8 or 10 songs. It is better than its brother cd Reload, which is almost all filler itself. But overall this album is a decent listen, you have skip tracks to find the good ones, and its not really good for playing straight through. Like their older cd's are."
3,Loaded...with mediocre,"Yeah, it's a alright album, but it began what would become Metallica's downfall. The black album's sucess killed them, with them going more for airwaves on the radio, it sld them cd's at first, but eventually led to St Anger. They go in a different direction, but it more sounds like 70's hard rock. Instead of making there own voice, i feel it's more copying someone elses. if your into the thrash on the older metallica albums, you will not find it here. The instrument parts are more watered down, as well as the production is unfortunally, which is a shame because with a few different settings and a different direction this could of been a fantastic album. Overall, alright album, maybe one to download :D"
1,Very sad...,"If you compare it to all the garbage that is always being played on the radio or eMpTyV, this album is not that bad. But if you compare it to the work that this band did in the 80's, this is absolute trash!!! Long gone are the days in which MetallicA was one of the top 5 music acts in the world. It's very, very sad... :("
1,Sell Outs...Every Last One Of Them...,They need to go back to thier garage and do some serious soul searching
1,What the hell is this? It cant be Metallica!,This album was terrible! I dont know how you could go from Kill em All-Metallica to this crap! Someone get me some ear plugs! Only good song- House that Jack Built
3,Where's Metallica?,"Metallica made their die hard fans wait five years for this? This is a LOAD of crapp! How could they go from being headbanging monsters to a wimpy little alternative band? Perhaps the music is good in comparison to other alternative/rock bands, but not Metallica. Give me a break. When you listen to tracks such as ""Mama Said"", you think, ""wow, this is good"". When you realize that it is Metallica playing, you say ""What the hell?"" Truly a LOAD of crapp when you consider what Metallica is capable of. I still respect their music tremendously and I know that they can still wip out the old metal and kick butt."
2,"I'm a big metalica fan, but I don't like this album.","Metallica is gone since they have released ""Black Album"". Please back to 80's sound. I love the 80's Metalica sound."
5,"It is not quite Metallica, but it is still great.","Well with this album Metallica took a 180 degree turn from what they had previously done. It is slower indeed, but if you listen to the lyrics, it is one of the deepest albums they have realeased. And musically, the melodies, counter-melodies, and harmonies are more sophisticated than the other albums. I admit it does not sound like Metallica used to sound. But this IS Metallica."
4,"yeah, I'm starting to like Metallica","great. Now they have me hooked. Pretty soon I am going to find myself looking for another Metallica CD to buy. This is a great addon to my small collection. Metallica is a great band, they don't brag about themselves, and their music is straight from the heard and soul. This is a great CD, go for it! buy it!"
4,"Not as good as the black album, but thats a high standard","James, Kirk, Jason, and Lars are back with a surprisingly good album, their best since the 1991 self-titled smash. The group has clearly matured and grown, and they do reflect this in their sound. They still rock just as hard but now James is more or less singing instead of yelling. There are more ballad types of songs on the album, like ""Bleeding Me"", ""The Outlaw Torn"", or my favorite tracks ""Until it Sleeps"" and ""Hero of the Day"". Harder tracks are ""King Nothing"", ""2X4"", and ""Ain't My Bitch"". This album is the best they released from 1991-1998 so buy it if you are a Metallica fan. For those of you who aren't Metallica fans, give it a listen and maybe you will see what all the fuss is about."
3,Kinda' cool,"Pros:*In my humble opinion,I think that the punishing ""King Nothing"" is the best song here.Extremely powerful.It alone makes this album good,but not great,since the new style isn't as good as,say,the black album's.*A lot of songs to choose from(14!)Cons:*Not the best Metallica album.Doesn't get close to the black album,or Reload.Bottom line:Not the best start if you're a non-Metallica fan,but a terrific choice for Metallica fans,for the astonishingly powerful ""King Nothing""."
1,If I could have I would've given it no stars!!!,"Never have I regretted buying a Metallica CD, until now. I tried to like it, but it was impossible. The new alternitve/country sound of this album just made me sick. I was completly disapointed with the new direction the music has taken. The only reason I knew it was a Metallica album was the name on the cover. If you like alternative then by all means buy the album. If you are looking for Heavy Metal buy something else, The Chemical Wedding by Bruce Dickinson is your best bet, IT ROCKS!!!!"
4,"A good album, though not as good as others.","I'm not a heavy-metal fan per se. I bought and enjoyed immensely ""Ride The Lightning"" and The Black Album (""Metallica""). After listening to other Metallica albums and disliking them as mere noise, I bought ""Load.""Though without outstanding hits such as ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Creeping Death"", ""The Unforgiven"" or ""Nothing Else Matters"", this album still holds its own with beautiful songs such as ""Hero of the Day"", ""King Nothing"", ""Bleeding Me"" and ""Until It Sleeps.""I recommend this album for people who aren't necessarily heavy-metal die-hards who already have ""Ride The Lightning"" and The Black Album."
1,Simply Just Not Good...,"Load thier sixth albumComing off thier most successful album Self titled Metallica, they released Load. To put it plainly, its just not good. To anyone that will try to tell me im not a 'real' fan because I don't like Load has no idea how many hours i've spent listening to this great band. Im not using the whole 'selling out' thing as an excuse not to like this album either. I have listened to Load many times trying to give it a chance; I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't there. Aint (...) is the only reason that I even still have Load, and even then I only end up putting it in every once in a long while."
2,Hmm.,"I used to like this album, as well as Reload. But then, something happened.I heard Ride the Lightning. And Master of Puppets. And Kill 'em All. And ...And Justice for All.When I came back to Load and Reload, I was surprised at how empty this music sounded. Except for a few songs (Until It Sleeps, Bleeding Me, Outlaw Torn, which are decent), this album isn't very good.Call it whatever you want, but to me this is pop country."
3,like,Metallica had some good hits this was good but not the best album made i would say a 5.1 for this
5,yes!!!!,"Found it for the right price and it shipped really fast. I had this years ago but iy got stolen,i need better friends."
3,The Eternal Lover,"This book by Edgar Rice Burroughs was originally published in two parts, in 1914 and 1915. It is about a caveman named Nu. In the first story, Nu time travels to the early 20th century and meets a girl who is the reincarnation of his old girlfriend. Tarzan actually appears as a minor character in this story. In the second story, Nu ends up back in his own time period. This being Burroughs, Nu goes through various hardships before he ends up with his lady love. This is a minor Burroughs book, but it's fairly entertaining."
3,A very strange soundtrack CD.,"This CD is sawed off version of what was in the film, probably to make it a Zimmer showcase (does Zimmer need a showcase). Aside from the one Mozart piece and Larry Wright's drum solo, the CD is all Zimmer. No Enya. No Soul II Soul. No David Carr. No Zorba the Greek. No more Mozart. Etc. etc. I don't think this should deter you from enjoying this CD unless you happen to focus on the other pieces in the film. I mean Zimmer is a noted film scorer. I think the oddest thing about this CD is the title of the film protagonist's composition: in the film it was ""For"" Bronte, not ""Pour"" Bronte. I mean, that was right in the film. See Enya's Watermark CD for her work in the film."
4,Green Card- CD,Enjoyed the movie and seeing it again reminded me of how much I had enjoyed the soundtrack when I saw the film years ago. So glad Amazon had the DVD so I could order it.
4,Solid Feel,"Others said these needed washers to keep them from turning in the hole. This isn't true the cylinders have the normal flat sides. The ""feel"" when you switch them on and off is very solid. They seem to be well constructed. You do have to solder the connections. I would have preferred screw connections on the base I took one star off for that."
2,key switch with 2 keys,"The switch itself is fine, but it needs a washer to go with it to keep it from turning once it is installed in the hole. I called and they don't have any such thing. It needs to be a flat washer with two flat spots on the inside circle to work properly. It sholuld also have screw on connections, these are soldered connections."
4,"Needed now more than ever: a retroactive response to the ""sensory turn"".","Lecercle draws attention to what is typically ignored in contemporary studies of Deleuze (in the wake of overdoses of Derrida in the 80s and 90s), the relationship between language and sensation. The question is important not only because we will never wholly overcome language with sensation, but also because language and sensation are always in relation to one another. If an alternate politics to that of the present is indeed possible, it will not be that of ""just sensation"" or ""just language"", but rather that which throws the false opposition into disarray, enabling the emergence of a mode of materialism that is no more devoid of ideas than a mode of ideas that is devoid of materialism..."
2,Its the best available but only b/c its the only one,"Lecercle has written other works that at least deserve a read but this particular book is probably not one of them. Amazingly, Lecercle picks the best quotes from Deleuze but has them pointed in the wrong direction. His continual talk of metaphor in Deleuze misses the subtley of Deleuze's work. The greatest crime however is the complete reduction of Guattari to that of another instance of the machine Deleuze. Guattari's value to Deleuze seems to always be reduced and it is to everyone's loss. If one would read Guattari before he met Deleuze everything in the ""Capitalism and Schizophrenia"" (at least that on language) is already present. The same cannot be said of Deleuze who was still to much of structualist and Lacanian before he met Guattari."
4,A Rare Color Series From The 1950s,"Sergeant Preston Of The Yukon is very entertaining (76 of the 78 episodes are in color), with outdoor scenes which were filmed in Colorado. The quality of the transfers ranges from great to okay visually, with the sound sometimes below par. Even so, I had never seen this show before the DVD release, and I found myself always rooting for the trio of Preston, his dog, Yukon King, and horse Rex (the latter of whom only appeared in season one). The two black and white episodes, which are from season three, may well have been initially filmed in color, but only exist in monochrome here. This mega series set is substantially cheaper than what I paid for the individual seasons."
5,Sergeant Presenton of the Yukon,"What a great and endearing TV series, a show that I never missed watching as a young kid. And these DVDs very well capture the adventure and action as I rememeber it. Well done, and VERY well worth the purchase!"
5,One truth,"Leo Hartong is one of the clearest, intelligent, articulate and considerate communicators of non-duality around today.Leo's second book, From Self to Self is a worthy follow-up / companion to the now classic Awakening to the Dream - expanding on and probing deeper into many of the topics explored in that book.Each of the short chapters - taken mainly from e-mails and letters - is presented in a question and answer format that lends an intimacy and relevancy that is often lacking in the traditional method of transcription from satsang recordings."
4,Good Extention of Awakening ...,"This book is a great extention of Awakening to the Dream. One thing I've learned about the author in reading his work is that he makes great use of metaphor and repetition. This is a very effective teaching style. It certainly works for me. If you got into Awakening to the dream, you'll like this book too. I particulary like the short style of the sections. I can do a few reads while waiting at the bus stop, doctors office, or right before going to bed."
4,Not as much fun as Fit,"Since purchasing Wii Fit, I have focused on similar Wii games. While I thoroughly enjoy Wii Fit, I have not found the same level of enjoyment with this game. With Wii Fit, I kept playing and unlocking new things. I have not found that same addiction with this game. Some of my movements do not register with the game. The connecting and disconnecting the nunchuk can get tiresome. Maybe it will grow on me in time."
2,Just not happy with it,"I have the Wii Fit and have been using it for a couple months. I thought I'd try this product just to get some variety. Sorry I did.The interface to the game is not nearly as good good as the Wii fit. The exercise routines are OK, but the leg band keeps falling off and the rubber band they send you to work with is a joke.While some of the graphics are nice, the overall quality of it is just not up to what I expected."
1,Not for folks with a latex allergy.,The resistance band and leg strap both contain latex. Would have been nice if that was noted on the outside packaging.
1,WII Active,"A little disappointed, does not always pick up body movements and transfer to the screen. May have been a better ""fit"" out there. You might try it out before you buy it and are stuck with it."
3,"more challenging than wii fit, but trainer is annoying","i'll still use it because it gives you back to back exercises, and I'm now really bored of the Wii Fit, but the trainer is seriously annoying. She's like one of those yuppie parents who has to over-narrate every single thing the child does in a patronizing tone. If the sensors aren't quite picking up on your movements it will say ""watch MY moves and do EXACTLY as I do."" I work out because it feels good, not to be barked at about how productive I am or to be told how in control I would be if only I took charge of the exercise at ten second intervals. Neurotic, but glad to see its on the market."
2,Leg strap,I am very disappointed in the leg strap. I bought this game to help lose weight and if you are heavy the leg strap is difficult to get on and keep on. In fact it may not fit depending on how big you are. The company should really develop and include in the game an extension for the leg strap.
1,Does not register my movements,"I think the overall concept of EA Active is great. The problem is that the actual product does not follow through.- The game does not register my movements. Many times it does not register that I've done the exercise. It just stays stuck in one place. Even if I'm holding still, it will tell me that I'm not.- Too much downtime between exercises. I wear a heart rate monitor and my heart rate drops too much between exercises for it to be effective.- Not intensive, or enough, cardio.- Resistance band is cheap and does not provide enough resistance to really work muscles.Overall, I find this be a big waste of money. I really expected more from EA and Nintendo with this product."
2,Extremely Awkward,"I think this game is great in theory, but it wasn't well implemented, particularly with regard to the controls. The leg strap falls off too easily. It's difficult to get the game to recognize your movements unless you hold the controller just so or have it just perfectly positioned in the pocket of the leg strap. The resistance band is chintzy and weak. I found myself struggling more with controls, the strap, and the band then with the actual workout."
2,Wii Active,I got tired of this very quickly. At first I thought it was great. Better than Wii Fit.Now I have Wii Fit Plus and I love it.The leg band was uncomfortable and I kept having to readjust.It was hard to actually get in the spirit. Too much wii control activity and not enough straight routine.
1,This has problems,Have used this system 3 times and it constantly fails to continue the exercises. I think there are multiple software deficiencies
1,Frustrating non-working technology,"This software could be really good, but after 3 days of dealing with all the non-sense involved, I'm either going to trade it in or throw it away. The game has no idea what my movements are. It says to run on the track, so when I start running in place, the message on the screen constantly switches back and forth from ""perfect"" to ""too slow"" even though I'm running at the same pace for the entire exercise. The resistance band that comes with the game is not even challenging for my 7 year old daughter. I'm not sure if it's 2 lbs or 5 lbs, but it's useless. When performing curls, the game repeatedly told me to hold still and hold my arms like the person on the screen. I ended up doing about 30 curls and it only registered one of them. I have no reason to believe this is a Wii hardware problem as the family plays lots of other games on a regular basis."
1,EA Active Sports gave me TENDONITIS,"I've been using this game for over two months now... as a workout, it is very effective: I actually felt motivated to exercise and would produce a sweat almost every time.Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with tendonitis this week, resulting from the repetitive strain on my wrists from pulling the orange weight band. Tendonitis is commonly developed after the start of a new workout program, since it puts a new, constant, and repetitive strain on your wrists. And boy does it hurt, all day, every day.So a warning: you'll get a good workout, but be very careful of your wrists! If you also play other games like MartKart that involve repetitive finger motions, EA Sports might well be the death knell for your hands."
1,"Good concept, bad software",This game has a bug that sometimes it can not recognize the movement and just hang there.
3,Wii Active,This game does not weigh you which would be benificial if you want to keep track of your weight loss as well as how many calories you have burned. The black handels don't come attached to the fitness band.
1,Very disappointed,The reason I gave the Wii Active such a poor review is the numchuck holder is designed very poorly. The numchuck holder does not stay on the thigh very well - Nintendo could of come up with a different way to hold the numchuck on the leg. If I knew how poorly designed the holder was I would not have purchased this workout from Nintendo. I wish I could get a refund.
2,Left me with nothing but aching knees,"Thankfully a friend loaned this to me, so I wasn't out the money. I tried it maybe 5 times over 2 weeks, doing the 30 Day Challenge after the 1st time. While at first it seemed I was getting a good workout, after the first time, the only thing I was feeling after the fact was massive knee pain. I amped up to the ""hard"" setting on the Challenge, and I have to say, it was not challenging at all. There is a lot of stop & wait, a lot of ""hold still"" and a lot of annoying chatter from the trainer. If I ever hear ""You, my friend, are poetry in motion"" again, I may have to strangle someone.I would say if you have any experience working out at all, this won't do it for you. If not, perhaps this is the way to get into working out."
4,Have yet to use it,"Got it opened it and then life happened. But i have been looking forward to it soooo much. As soon as i am once again able, i will be all about this and all my other wii games i recently purchased."
3,Pure Exercise,"Unless I just haven't gotten into it far enough, this game is pure exercise. I haven't found anything ""fun"". If you are not in good shape, which I am not, it is a very challenging work out."
5,EA Sports Active,Love it! You get the best workout ever! Very Highly recommend for those men and women that can't get to the gym.
5,So much fun!!,I love the wii active...I am someone who exercises all the time 5 days a week and was looking for something new tired of the boring treadmil and this is so much fun you end up really sweating and time flies by so fast. It is great for all ages and especially for someone who wants to get in shape a definately must have for the wii collection
2,Frustrating,"Some aspects of this game are fun and challenging but the game is just too frustrating to use for a regular workout. I have had the same problems a lot of others complain about -- the resistance band snaps and doesn't offer much resistance anyhow, and my movements do not always register. It's annoying to have to stop to adjust the remote in all different directions to find the perfect angle to make it register -- even when following the directions exactly. I would not recommend the game."
5,Excellent Workout and Fun Too!!!!,"I love this product. I have had the Wii fit since it came out last year and though it is fun, it didn't give me what I needed in terms of a workout. Well, they have outdone themselves with the EA Active Sport. I have literally improved the way my body looks in 3 short weeks. I love the shape of my legs, arms, shoulders, and back. The workouts are short but targeted. Best of all, I look forward to the workout because it is so much fun. For those who don't want to spend money on the gym and don't have a lot of time, this is the answer."
3,Huge strain on the knees...,"I got this game during the holidays, and I couldn't wait to try the 30-day Challenge feature. The 30-day challenge is VERY heavy on lunges, jumps--including lunge jumps and side-to-side jumps), and running in place. These activities are very hard on your knees. I had meniscus surgery in the mid 90's, never had a bit of problem since then...until I started playing this game. Now that old pain is back. I'm giving up on the game and hoping that the pain goes away so I can avoid another surgery and disruption to my family. If you start feeling pain/strain in your knees, please stop. Don't try to push through and continue on to finish the challenge. I got a little over halfway through, and was hobbling around my house in pain. Not worth it."
2,Needs a little tweeking.,"Fun game, but system does not pick up each body movement - which makes it very frustrating to continue."
3,Leg strap is annoying,"I love the activities in this game, and I can really work up a sweat when I am doing them. My only complaint is the leg strap. It is sometimes uncomfortable, I have to pull it up often, and when I am switching exercises it is annoying to try to get the nunchuck out or put it back in. My favorite part is the running and walking exercises. This game would be perfect if it wasn't for the leg strap."
2,annoying,"The leg strap falls off easily. The game doesn't do a good job registering your movements and you can't keep going once it decides your not moving your arm in the exact correct position, even if you are actually moving the correct way. You can customize your workouts but you can't just go in and try different activities, you have to actually set up a workout in order to even just try one exercise, which is time consuming when you just want to try the different activities. There are no core muscle exercises."
4,Brought it for myself and then brought it as a gift,The game is fun you do get a little sweaty depending on which drills you do overall it a fun game. I wouldn't substitute it for my gym membership but great for those days where you didn't make it in for your workout.
3,"love, it but I am right handed","I am having a great time with it. I am doing the 30 day challenge and each day is a new workout and it it fun to do. I got a kick out of tennis today, so I asked my hubby to try it out, and he is a lefty. He has to watch a right handed avatar play. So he can hold the remote and play with his left hand, but he has to watch a right handed avatar for his cues. I find it hard to believe that this game makes no attempt to make it easy for lefties. I set up a new player for him and there was no place to chose what hand is dominate."
4,"Wonderful Program, Shoddy Acessories","I just got the game today and tried it out. I'm very pleased with my purchase, but the elastic band is very flimsy and I find myself handling it very carefully when exercising. I half expected it to break with each curl.The leg strap slipped loose and finally left my leg during the boxing and kicking game. I strapped it back on as tightly as I could, and it stayed after that, but I could still feel it threatening to loosen with each kick.I plan to make my own leg strap for the nunchuck out of lycra or a similar elastic material that will hug my thigh, but replacing the elastic strap will take a little more research.Overall though, I love the game and regret nothing!"
5,Great exercise motivation,"I bought this game when I realized I wasn't going to follow through with any self-motivated exercise regimen. But I do love me some videogames, so I thought that having exercise in a game would pique my interest. Assumption correct! I actually can't wait to workout now (except for my aching pudgy body). Having my avatar on screen and the trainer talking to me is engaging enough for me to keep with it. The 30 day challenge is well laid out: I don't have to think about my workout, just do it; the whole program is predetermined for me, including blessed rest days. Can't wait for the sequel this fall."
3,So-so game,"The game itself is not bad, but the elastic band it comes with is horrendous! The first time while using it, about 5-6 repetition of the excise on the screen the thing broke and we had to reknot the damn thing.Though it is pretty fun to play with someone else, the dancing game is pretty fun as is the skateboarding one. Decent game, just disappointed with the resistance band that came with it."
5,Wonderful,"This is surley a wonderful and workable game, it reallys does do what it says and its also alot of fun. If anyone once a good workout and a good sweat then this is the one to have EA Sports Active."
5,Fitness made fun!!!,I purchased this game as a way to lose weight and get into shape...I was very pleased ...I am about to finish my first 30 day challenge... I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun and get into shape..Enjoy
3,"Choppy workout, doesn't flow well","I got this and was really let down. I didn't get an effective workout from it due to the fluidity, or lack thereof, of the program. Each time you change activities, the tutorial pops up along with instructions for the Wii controller. Also, during some of the workouts, like squats, the nunchuck needs to be positioned perfectly or the game doesn't register your motion. This constantly had me shifting around the controllers and skipping through tutorials. I spent more time standing than moving.I didn't like that is doesn't track your progress in any way or suggest what workouts might be best for you. Some of it was fun, but it just wasn't doing enough to actually tone me up or lose weight. I ended up going back to Fitness Coach (Wii version of Yourself Fitness) for a better, more effective, workout."
5,Great Workout!!,This game give you a great workout....a variety of exercises so you don't get bored. I'm using muscles that I didn't use before.
5,A great workout!!,I love this game. It's better than all the money I spent at the gym on a personal trainer. You can do the programs already designed or create your own workout. It tells you how many calories burned and tracks your progress. I recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight or maintain a healthy lifestyle.
1,Awful - does not work - save your money,"Awful design - save your money! The leg strap is either too tight or falling off. Even when properly on the Wii will not read the remotes. For some reason, the game stops dead if it can't tell what you are doing. I spend more time adjusting remotes & waving them at the machine to get the exercise started back up than I do actually exercising. Needless to say, I am not achieving my target heart rate, although my blood pressure is way up.My wii does other games fine; software glitch or something? Very poor design to have the exercise come to a dead stop if it cannot read what you are doing.Also, the intensity of the exercise is lacking. I am an overweight couch potato trying to get a bit more fit, and I have a hard time breaking a sweat on a lot of them."
2,not as good as people say,I am a mom of 2 and have been trying to get some workout in at home. I thought this would be very challenging. The upper body workout is not challenging at all and there is no ab workout. With in a week of using this the resistant band broke. I thought I would just return it since I barely even used it. I was told that I could only exchange for another one. I was not happy about that. I would not get this item again if I had the choice.
2,A big hassle,"I hated putting on the leg strap. which always fell down or completely off. Also, when you're doing the exercises a lot of of times the game doesn't pick up your movement so you are stuck and not able to move ahead. Total pain. I ended up buying an exercise DVD instead."
5,A real workout,"I ordered this to use along with the Wii fit plus. The fit is more fun to do, but the sports active gives a work out you can feel. I can tell the next morning that I worked out."
3,"Good game, but...","I really like the exercises and the variety, but I was frustrated when the exercise band split only 2 weeks after I got the game!"
4,Great Workout,"I have to say that this is a really great workout. I was disappointed with the Wii Fit as it seemed geared more towards kids and many of the activities were for balance and timing. This ""game"" provides an excellent workout in about 40 minutes (depending on if you watch the tutorials). It nicely tracks your goals and progress and allows you to enter diet and other activity information. It is also a good mix of cardio and muscle strengthening/toning. 2 drawbacks...but would not deter me from getting the game in any way...the resistance band is very weak. Since I already had some other bands this wasn't a big deal. The other issue is sometimes the nunchuck does not ""register"" as in the correct position. Many times simply lunging lower will fix the issue. All around great title and worth the dough if you want to lose weight!."
2,wait for the update in November,"EA Sport Active is a great concept. An interactive coach that monitor your form, speed, etc while performing the reps with you is amazing. Unfortunately, this software come with a big issue; it has glitches. Certain exercises cannot be recognized, no matter how you attempt to mimic the fitness model. What happens? The game stops (trying to correct you) and you become increasingly frustrated. This can go on for 4, 5, 8 mins. Worse than the frustration is you lose the 'pump' and your heart rate drops (I wear a monitor). Finally you cancel out that session and on to the next... and it will happen again on another exercise. I contacted the tech's at the software company and they said 'Yeah, we know. We get a lot of complaints on it' only to end the conversation with 'maybe it's your form?' It's not. They made a ton of money on a faulty software. You've been warned. Make a better choice."
2,just OK,"The 30 day challenge has a lot of running and jumping which is very hard on the knees. I already had one replacement (and need the other knee replaced) so I have to take many of these exercises out of my workout. The ones left are okay but I don't feel that I get that good of a workout. And you definitely need to have the remote and nunchuck in the correct position or they won't register your movements.If you choose to use the balance board, you either have to take off and put on your sneakers several times or (as I now do) just keep them on while using the board. I know this isn't recommended but it is less of a hassle.I finished the 17th day of the challenge today. I still do WiiFit Plus everyday in addition to this one. I enjoy WiiFit Plus much better than this one but I will continue to use both. (P.S. I DO NOT WEAR shoes when using Fit Plus.)"
2,leg strap too short,"I didn't get too far because the leg strap is too short to fit high enough on my leg for the nunchuck to register well. For the first running exercise I could just put it in my pocket, but the squats were just impossible. I may give it one more try to see if there is any way I can rig this thing to work with my body, but otherwise I may just return it. When making a fitness product, it helps to consider that people who aren't fit and are looking to change that may want to use it."
4,Nice... but not that much fun,"It's an excellent personal trainer... if that's what you are looking for, that's what you'll get.But it has no fun games or easy to access activities, most are routines, and long ones.It won't be a game to play with friends or family as WiiFit could be, but it sure accomplishes it's objetive to make you sweat and train.It's responsiveness is sometimes clumsy, trying to accelerate your rhythm at some excercises might not always work."
4,A good workout,"I would definitely say this game works you out. I am an avid runner and am fairly active, so I was skeptical to say the least. But this game definitely gave me a workout and got me sweating. It offers tons of different exercise to keep your interest... I'm hoping they come out with some additional ones in the future."
4,I Love it.....,I love the Wii Active. It gives a great workout. I was sore the next day after the first time.Two complaints though.... First it doesn't really explain that the numchuck goes in upside down. Once I figured that out it worked a lot better. Second the leg strap. At first I was excited that it was actually going to fit around my thigh. As I work out though it slides down. It works better on skin than on clothes.I love it though. No more gym for me....
5,Great workout!!,"I love my Wii fit but hate how you can't put together an intense workout to really get your heart pumping and I have been looking for something that does it - I have found the answer! EA active kicks my butt!! I use it with my Wii balance board (but you don't have to have it - you only use if for a few exercises). I am doing the 30 day challenge on medium right now and have woken up with sore muscles since starting and haven't stopped sweating yet. And, I can already feel and see a difference! This is much cheaper then a gym membership and easier to fit into my schedule since I don't have to travel to the gym. This is a must buy!!!!!!"
4,Finally - Strenuous Exercise!,I bought the Wii and Wii Fit to exercise. I'm disappointed with them because you can't get your heart rate up. But this is great! I would like to see more emphasis on the mid section.
4,"Good workout, okay included equipment","This is a great supplement to WiiFit, and definitely more of a ""work-out"" than WiiSports, but the equipment is less than fab. The leg strap is uncomfortable and the elastic band is weak, I can believe the reviews that say it's already ripped."
3,Three Stars - Here is Why,"- 1 star - NO exercises targeted specifically for your abs. None. That's an issue and worthy of losing one star.- 1 star - A.) Too much repeating if you don't have a Wii balance board. I am on the tail end of my first 30 day program and am starting to get bored. (However, I am burning cals and losing weight.) B. The resistance band does not allow for much resistance. (Had to purchase some rip cords.) And C. The game makes it difficult to maintain a steady cadence. It usually favors a quicker cadence for the right leg (where the nunchuck is strapped)over the left leg."
4,good workout,I have the wii fit and I really enjoyed it. but you really didn't get a good workout with it. It was more fun and games. this you actually sweat. the only thing I don't like about it is that the resistance band isn't hard enough. but I figured that I could just go to walmart or some store and buy harder ones (they are pretty cheap). I don't work out really at all but I really enjoyed it I was sweating by the end and there is 3 levels that you can choose from. I choose the easy level to start out with and it gave me a good workout.
4,Great workout,"I hate working out but I did enjoy this workout, you can definitely feel the burn especially the next day. My only complaint is the elastic strap is too long so you have to fold it over to get a good workout and the handstraps doo not stay tied to it very well. This game is like Wii fit it is the Wii fit for grownups. The balance board really gets you into the workout."
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE LEFT HANDED,This game does not have provisions for left handed people and takes away from the game. EA is not commenting on it. This is a big oversight them.
3,"Eh, it's okay.","This is the type of program that makes me hate working out. It's a full-on Western workout, which I know appeals to many people. Not me, though. I don't care to be stuck on a track when I'm at home. I need something a little more interesting. I was also annoyed that there was no ab work in this game. Not a very complete workout system.However, I will say that this is a great workout for your arms and legs. It's probably great for working out, if that's your goal. It wasn't my goal, so eh. I also liked the incentives to win trophies. That's nice. I would recommend this game to someone who likes straight-forward Biggest Loser type of workouts."
2,awkward,The leg strap and and also the cheap flimsy resistance band are awful. You have to assemble the resistance band. The loops on the resistance band are too small to fit my hands in. When using the leg strap in falls down my leg. There is hardly any resistance at all in the resistance band. If EA improved on these two things it would be a decent product. Maybe put a real resistance band in the box?. I'll stick with a real gym for now...
2,Long time set up,"I have yet to really use this product fully as the set up takes a bit of time. In addition, you pick your own type of music and I don't particularly care for any of the choices. I'm a more Oldies/Country type and they are not a choice.I think the exercises should allow for people with prior sports injuries. I had knee surgery and can't do a lot of the lower body exercises such as lunges, squats, etc. and they should offer alternate exercises they can be done with the lower body."
2,just doesn't work well,It's to bad but on to many of the activities there isn't enough detecion and your person in the game just stands there and doesn't do anything and then you can't play on it sucks!
2,It could be much better!,"This was the first day I used it.Pros:It has an organized program, easy to followThe graphics are OKCons:The leg strap is falling down on my leg all the time. It takes my attention to the strap instead of focusing on the exercise. By the way. I am wearing pants!!!!The resistance band is a joke. It hurts the skin of my hands. Using weights and holding the remote control and the nunchuk in one hands is not feasible.I did not find the use for the fitboard. No special feedback when using it. A wasted opportunity!A very important component of a fitness program is one's weight. One cannot use the board to evaluate daily changes. This was a silly oversight!There is delay between one movements and the moment they get into the program. It is very distracting..."
1,EA Sports Active,I was a little disappointed in this. I read lots of positive reviews and how it was better than the Wii Fit. I disagree. There is a lot of running which I can't do and it's mostly exercises without being games so it's not that fun. I used the Wii Fit every day for 5 months and was ready for a change but I've had this for 3 weeks and only used it once. Wish I had my $[...] back!
4,EA Active,"Gets you into your workout. I just wish it gave you 10 minute rests when it knows you should need them. Other than that, its motivational and fun!"
3,It's no Gym,"Got this cause i was bored with Wii Fit, and while it's a little bit better...don't expect this to pump you up. It's not nearly as intensive as lifting weights and doing REAL cardio, but certainly can be a good way for someone who is intimidated at the gym to start to ease into a workout routine and earn for some more! I'll won't be canceling my gym membership anytime soon though..."
5,Great Workout!!,"I've only used the product for a few days now and love it. It's great to go through an entire workout routine without stopping to pick another activity. I feel like I work a lot harder and more complete (head to toe) than Wii Fit. This ""game"" challenges you to work hard and sweat."
4,Great! Great! Great! But have a question for other users,"I am thrilled with this product! It is definitely not a ""game"" it is a workout product. Still love my Wii Fit and use that also, but I love the intensity of the Active. The workouts are only around 20 minutes long, so I tend to do them twice.My question is on the inline skating section where you need to jump, any suggestions? I keep jumping but obviously I am doing something wrong because I never get credit for one."
3,Too much rigamarole.,"This game would be just fine if not for all the time spent stopping to put on and take off that darn thigh wrap (which only stays on if I'm wearing the right pants or shorts) and stuff the nunchuck in the teeny pocket. Also, it's annoyingly picky about how ""fast"" I do the exercises-- I follow the avatar's motion exactly, and somehow it's still not right. This causes the avatar to stop and chew me out (while I am forced to stand there and wait patiently for her to start up again, lest she continue to tell me what an awful job I'm doing before returning to the exercises), wasting more precious time in which I should be working out. Good concept, bad design."
3,Would be great but too compliacted,I bought this game as I wanted a great workout that was fun for the Wii. I was looking forward to it considering it had sports like the inline skating and the boxing. But my biggest problem with this game is it does not allow you time to grab the resistance band or put the numchuck in the pocket. It goes from one workout to another without allowing you time to set your controllers down and pick up the band or put the numchuck in the pocket. Also one thing I don't like is that strap for the band around your thigh is huge and keeps wanting to slip down my leg. The trainers think you are not doing the movements when in turn you are trying to adjust the strap or pick up the resistance band. All in all it would be a great workout and you would get great results but it is just too complicated with all the tools you need for it. Less is more when it comes to this workout.
2,Maybe good for someone who is new to exercise...,"I just bought this, did the ""hard"" workout, and felt like I wasted almost 60 bucks. While I did break a little sweat...this game was not challenging enough for me. I could see how this game would be good for someone who is just starting out with exercise, but as I already get regular vigorous exercise, it just didn't cut it. I also found the resistance band to be flimsy and a bit of a joke, not providing enough resistance to get real toning. Also, if I am going to run...I am going to run outside in the sunshine and fresh air, not run in place in my apartment. While I did like the boxing challenges, the rest I could have done without. I liked Wii fit's yoga and strength training much better as it focuses on balance and correct posture. Save yourself some money and get Jillian Michaels or Tie Bo workout videos. They are cheaper and provide a much better workout."
3,so-so,"Just got this yesterday, and tried it out. I started on the medium level. I get more of a workout on the Wii Fit than this. The band is kind of a joke as well, not much resistance. Overall, not too pleased."
4,Not Developed For Left Handed People In Mind,"I'm still learning the different activities for the EA Sports Active so my rating is tentative. I can't give it a five, though, no matter how much I play and like it because if there's a way to switch the hand for the main wii-mote from right to left, I've not found it. That means that I either have to do some activities (such as the tennis activities) ""backwards"" or do them much more awkwardly and somewhat more clumsily with my right hand. That definitely takes away some of the fun for me. Doing things as a right handed doesn't feel natural and I do find it harder to concentrate on whatever activity I'm doing because I keep wanting to adjust the remote in my right hand or switch to my left altogether. Given that some games do allow for a handedness setting, I don't think it would have been asking too much to expect such an option in a game like EA Sports Active."
2,EA Sports Active,"The product is fair. Not all motions are reflected and you end taking a long time to get the information to record. For example, in the lunges an individual could be doing the exercise, but the software/hardware will not recgonize the motion. Things depend on how the nunchuk is in the pocket and/or how the motion is executed.Also, most of the exercises do not use the wii balance board -- at least the ones I have seen. I would not recommend the product. The activities that come with the wii fit balance board are much better.2 Stars at best"
2,The idea is better than what actually happens!,"I would not recommend this game due to the fact that it often underperforms. It does not read your movements as well as WII does which causes you to have to repeat the excercise numerous times. It gets very furstrating at times. I loved the idea but it was below my expectations for reading movements. Also, the graphics are not the best. My sister, my daughter and I were all equally disappointed!"
3,"OK game, prefer others.","This is an okay game, it was fun for a while but we got bored with it. I prefer Gold's Gym which is boxing. Sometimes the sensor is off, and it doesn't accurately judge what I am doing. The lunges for some reason never work with this game- I do it correctly but it always says it's wrong. For the price I prefer others."
4,A Step Above Wii Fit,It hurts so Good! I really enjoyed Wii Fit and it helped me begin to get back in shape. As my conditioning improved I found that it took me over an hour to get the workout that I wanted and it felt like many of the aerobic exercises needed another level. EA Sports active seems to fill this need. The workouts take about 30 minutes at the hard level and I get all that I want and more in terms of a rigorous workout. It hurts and makes me sweat but thats GOOD! The only reason I have not added a 5th star is that I want to see the results than 30 days of using it will allow.
4,Great work out!,It's a great work out and definitely had me sore a few days in a row. You can create your own workout or do one of the pre-created ones at various difficulties.
4,I like it but wish there was more,"I do like the Wii Active and feel that it does work. The only thing I don't like is that you can't review the exercise before other than watching the ""watch me"". For example, while making my own workout, there were 6 different icons for volleyball. Sure they say, SET, HIT, BUMP, SERVE, ETC but it would be nice to see the whole thing first to decide if I can Volleyball #1, #2 or #3, etc. The other thing is it seems as if they target mostly upper or lower body areas. Being a typical middle aged woman that enjoys a good beer now and then, I need to target mostly my middle and there wasn't alot to choose from. I do think it works. I really like the 30 day challenge idea but again, seemed like it targeted upper & lower mostly. But so far I've tried Gold's Gym (like for boxing)Gold's Gym Cardio Workout, Jillian's FitnessJillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum 2009My Fitness CoachMy Fitness Coachand Wii FitWii Fit Plus with Balance Boardand of them all I like Active the best."
5,Serious workout,"I am so glad I bought the wii active! I also own the wii fit but that is more of a ""fun"" ""game"" type work out and the wii active is a really great workout. It is very much what I needed since I have children; and a membership at a gym is not really in the budget nor do I have time to go to the gym. This is a GREAT product, if you are looking for a great workout and don't want to leave home to do it, then this is for you."
5,Best Workout Wii Game Yet!,"Absolutely fantastic. Wide variety of exercises. Great movement tracking with the leg strap. Summary:- It's just as fun without the balance board. I doubt I'll purchase one.- The running exercises are MUCH more enjoyable if you have a mini-trampoline.- It's easy to upgrade the resistance on the band. I swapped out the red band and inserted a more durable, stronger rubber hose from another piece of workout equipment. It really stepped up the arm exercises.- It's completely customizable. You can create any combination of workouts that you want. I'm currently doing the 30 day challenge but if you wanted to you could set it up to do arms mon, legs wed, etc.Highly recommended!"
5,Just what I needed,This game is just what I needed. It is the trainer in the box! The steps are all explained. I am new to working out and Im glad I got something that is not boring.
1,Just a way to play games,"The WII Active gives you a nice alternative to walking, running and jumping, but the resistance bands are a problem. The bands that come with the package aren't adequate for a taller or more fit person. The suggestion is to buy bands that fit your height and resistance need. The problem is that the WII controllers don't pick up the signal as well, so the trainer gets ""stuck,"" and you are unable to go forward without bumping out of the exercise. After bumping out of all of the resistance band training exercises, there is no reason to have WII Active unless you need a running companion or the same sports you get on other WII games.Don't buy this product until the resistance band problem is resolved (or at least noticed by EA Sports)"
2,Frustrating when sensors don't work,"It is very hard to get in a good workout when after a few lunges the system suddenly can't read what you're doing and stops to try to tell you to ""put the nunchuck in the pocket,hold the remote facing up ..."" when they haven't moved. It's just not good when the program prevents you from doing straight reps and adds stress instead of reducing it. This was a complete waste of money for me."
3,Good Workout But Band Band Not Very Effective,I bought this game for the Wii because of trying to lose weight. I love the workout that it gives but theBand that came with it doesn't register when trying to do the required exercise's & the Wii does not seem torecognize that I am doing the actual workout. This is frustrating because I have to take all the exercisesoff that require the use of the Band which means that I am not getting the full workout.Other then this I like the Wii game and the exercises.
3,Useful but not impressive,"I just purchased it and worked our for a total of 36 minutes. This includes the initial 30 day challenge workout and one medium intensity workout that I created. The workouts are effective. They weren't necessarily fun; but, I don't believe they were intended to be really enjoyable. The workouts would be greatly improved if the game had more sensitive remote recognition and synchronization. My avatar was almost always out of sync with me; however, I guess the game understood my motions because I did fairly well even if my avatar was a spastic mess. The fitness tracking options appear to be extremely limited. The software only seems to only track calories burned and duration of workouts. It would have been nice if it also tracked weight gain/loss and your weight loss goals."
4,EA Active,I have read most of the reviews and a lot of them are spot on. Both good and bad. I think that this is a way more intense work out then Wii fit. The resistance band is weak but I had a different one anyway. I use these as alternate work outs to biking and Tae Kwon-Do. I had no problems with the registeration of movements although I will admit they are very specific on how they need to be done. It can get annoying. the first few days I have done it I have only had one or two reps stopped and corrected in each of those days. As for the timing I think it's perfect because correct motion is AS important as rhythm and speed of reps. You train your body to move properly it will benefit you a hundred times more then fast sloppier reps.
4,review,"I think this is a great product for those days when your not able to get to the gym. I do not use it as my primary form of exercise but I do enjoy having it for when I don't want to go to the gym. It is a very god leg workout (the lunges and squats) but the arm band is a little weak but I heard you can purchase I new one. Overall, this is a good game."
2,very frustrating,"The difficulty in getting my movement to register with the game makes the whole game pretty useless for me. To keep the leg strap from sliding, I have to tighten it very tight, which seems unwise (restrict the flow of blood to muscles you're working? Bad.) In many of the arm-movement exercises, my arm movements aren't registering well with the game at all. I spend at least a third of my exercise time not actually exercising, but adjusting and attempting to get the game to know what I'm doing.Since I don't have trouble with any other Wii games' knowing what the Wiimote or nunchuk are doing, this seems to be a Wii Active specific problem.And I'm not really getting much use from the game. Only frustration.Your mileage may vary."
3,Just OK,"This game is fun and I like how it has a daily calender and tracks your progress.Pros:Different sport activities dailyHeart monitorProvides a good work outChoosing the type of weights you use, I use free weightsCons:It has a hard time tracking some of the fast movements some of the exercises require like the foot fires exerciseThere is a long time between each exercise, estimated time for the workout is 33 mins but in reality you are done in 45 minsThe resistance bands are not great, I use free weightsThere is to much lower body exercises, almost all workouts feel like they're 85% squatting and jumping with 15% being armsOverall:I like this game for an easier at home work out but I still go to the gym everyday and run and bike."
2,Disappointed,"Wii Active is a huge disappointment. If you don't hold the remote and numchuk in the correct position, the games doesn't ""see"" what you're doing and it either makes you repeat it until you get it right (meaning the position of the remote and/or numchuk) or it won't let you go on. It also locks up and won't register what you've done at all, no matter what kind of gyrations you try to do to go on. I haven't gotten beyond the first set of workouts because it was so frustrating. The game wastes a lot of time having you take the band off and on, instead doing all the exercises using the band at once. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone."
4,"Wish I could give it a 5, but no ab work and poor resistance band","I have just completed the 20 day workout. I am really enjoying the workouts and end all of them feeling like I accomplished real exercise. I wish I could give this product 5 stars, because I am having fun and sticking with it. In reality though, this isn't a 5 star product. There are virtually no abdominal exercises and as many, many others have noted the resistance band that comes with the game is not strong enough. To make this game work I bought a second set of handles for the resistance bands from Amazon and a package of harder bands. I use 2 different bands for my workout, one band for exercises that stretch over my head, and a tighter band for the bent over rows and other lower height exercies."
5,Wii Active,I was looking for something that would help me exercise. This one really helps you keep track and gives you a work out that is fantastic!
3,It was ok,I bought this thinking that it would be better than the Wii Fit. It is very hard to get the leg strap to stay on even when put on correctly and the nunchuk doesnt fit in the required pouch very well. The nunchuk also doesnt respond well to the squats section of the workout.other than that i like that you can form your own workouts every day in order not to be completely bored with the repetitive workouts.
2,Very Frustrating,"I purchased the Wii Fit to get more exercise during the winter months. I really like it, but after so long I wanted something different. The EA Sports Active sounded like what I was looking for.It is the most frustrating game. My 30 minute challanges always turn into an hour or more just because of the way you have to hold the two controllers. You try over and over to get it right and it still will not register. If you do not have them held EXACTLY right, your Mii just stands there and the voice constantly tells you to try it again. You go back again and look at the video, checking for the correct placement of the controllers. You try again & again and continue to have the same problem. It is so frustrating! I wish I would have read about this complaint before I spent the money."
2,Frustrated,"The software as good as it is, can only go so far. You would think EA would take more time to test the leg strap, and realize how frustrating for everyone heavy or thin, for this thing to stay on. I've tried all the suggestions, but the strap still falls off. I think I'm getting more of a work out, picking up the strap, and trying endless ways to keep the strap on, then actually working out. Seriously! Finally, I stopped using the strap and figuring out ways to work with only the wii motes and nun chuck...actually way more liberating! I wanted to love this game, but come on EA think of the consumer! There are quite a few ""honest"" reviews here who don't overlook this. If you are willing to spend most of your workout picking up your leg strap, then I guess this won't disappoint. As for me, I expected more...especially if the leg strap is a vital part of each work out!"
3,"Overall, it's great! But...","I'm gonna make this short. Overall great concept but needs minor tweaking. The resistance band is a joke, so get a real one. Two, the nunchuck strap is constantly coming off, especially when running, both when put over bare skin and clothes. As for the workout concept and drills, simply great! But when you have a resistance band that doesn't really give any resisitance and a nunchuck strap you need to use active constantly falling off, I feel a little cheated. EA Sports had to have known this after testing the product."
2,This stinks!,"I purchased this on launch day as I could not wait to try it out. I haven't used it since. The leg strap won't stay up and the game doesn't recognize most of my movements. Save yourself the frustration and by My Fitness Coach, Wii Fit or Gold's Gym Cardioboxing.The only reason [...] because it did get me moving, even if it was frustrating."
4,Awesome with Kinks,"This is a great game. The 30 day challenge presents an opportunity to vary your workout day after day. The actual workouts are interesting and engaging, allowing one to use all body parts each time. There is also a nice mix between cardio and strength training. I've taken to completing the rep as instructed, then doing the rep again using my own free weights. This really intensifies the workout.The only problem I've seen so far is that the program sometimes neglects to save some workouts, causing them to be repeated. I've completed the same workout three times now!"
5,Working it out!!:-),This is wonderful! One of the best workouts I've experienced while in the comfort of my own home.
4,Great workout - but equipment needs improvement,"Provides a great workout. Loving it! However, beware that the leg strap tends to slide down the leg when you're jumping or running, even though it was tight. Also the resistance band does not provide enough resistance. I had a resistance band at home already, and i attached the handles to that instead. I had a little trouble with some of the exercises because the game wasn't registering my movement. However, i switched over to the demo to make sure i was doing it right, and the demo really helped to solve the problem.For a good workout, wii active is better than the wii fit, but the wii fit still is great fun for the whole family as a game, NOT as a workout."
3,EA Sports Active,"This is a great game. You actually can break a sweat playing it. That said, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because(1) it lacks support for lefties. Some activities it doesn't matter; others it does. For the activities where it does, the game will not register moves correctly if done left handed. Taking that into consideration, I put myself in their shoes...It's not easy to do some of the activities with your non-dominant hand...like lefties are expected to since the game doesn't offer a lefty option.(2) it lacks support for additional weights. The resistance band that come with the game is...well let's just say it doesn't have much resistance even folded up. I play the game on hard and still find it necessary to add resistance; however, sometimes when i use weights, the game doesn't register my moves correctly."
1,Argh! My knees!,"It seems that no matter what exercise regime I chose, what day it was on my 30-day plan all I did was lunge after lunge after lunge. The game should really be called EA Sports Lunge. After using the program for two weeks I woke up one morning and my knees now make a very loud ""click"" when I walk up stairs and are very stiff. Now, far be it from me to argue the quality of lunges but for pete's sake, why so many? I'm most unhappy with this product since if I took the lunges OUT of the regimes I'd be doing 3 exercises and be done in 5 minutes.All of the positive reviews really hyped me up for this but no one really mentioned the lunges. Besides, squatting would be slightly more productive anyway."
1,Not for people that work out regularly,"I'm surprised by all the positive reviews. For some context: I'm a healthy 26 year old female. I go to the gym about 3x per week, doing a combination of running (2-3 miles) and lifting weights. If you fall into that category, this game will NOT be enough of a workout for you. I did the ""high intensity"" setting, and didn't even break a sweat after 40 minutes. As many others have said, the resistance bands are laughably low. In addition, I spent way too much time trying to position the wii remote and nunchuck in a way that the game would actually recognize my movements. Perhaps this game would seem better if I never did any other exercise, but even then I feel that the annoying technical nuances of the game would make it not worth buying. I wish I could return this!"
3,Better Then Wii Fit,"IMHO this game is a lot better then Wii Fit. It has the ability to make you own workout save it and use it later. You don't have to keep going though menus. It does have some draw backs, when your punching the bag it seems to read one punch as two. could use a lot better resistance band for the workouts."
5,Great way to get active,"I bought this product a few weeks ago and I love it.I've owned a Nintendo Wii since December '08 and then on Jan '09 I bought the Wii Fitness with the balanced board, which I think is also a very good game, but nothing compared to the EA Active one.Wii Fitness is fun and basic, but the only thing on it that I like better over the EA Active is that the balance board also works as a scale and gives you your weight and BMI (not 100% accurate, but close enough).Besides that, I would recommend to anybody to get the EA Active. There are several ways you can exercise with this program, either just you, in pairs, specific exercises/levels and also the 30 days challenge (which is what I've been doing since I got it), that gives you different exercises everyday and even your own personal trainer.This is definitely as good as it gets if you want to get Active, get sweaty and even loose some pounds in the privacy of your own home!"
3,kickboxing?,"I got this about a month ago and was excited to try kickboxing as all the advertisements show a picture of someone kickboxing. Well, I have not found this exercise on my DVD. Perhaps someone can tell me how to get this??Overall, it is kind of an easy exercise program. The band that they provide with the game is way too easy. I have also been getting frustrated because the game doesn't track me all that well. Sometimes an exercise takes long/or even a few reps because the game doesn't think that I know what I am doing. Other times/reps it goes really fast. It is pretty frustrating. I just talked to some folks at Gamestop and there were really no help at all.."
4,LOVE IT!,Love the EA Sports Active. I'm doing the 30 day challenge and it is making me sweat! I got frustrated with the Wii fit as I didn't get a hard enough workout. NOT an issue w/ this! Bought it off Walmart though as better price.
4,EA Active,I just purchase a Wii because I wanted to get some exercise as well as have some fun. I like the EA Active although a few times it was difficult to maneuver. The strap is a little uncomfortable so I think I am going to purchase the balance board. Overall I do like it and hope to get fit in the coming days.
2,I'd rather work out with traditional aerobic videos.,"The pace was very slow, even for someone out of shape like myself. So, it takes far more time to get half the work out.The exercise band was too easy, even for someone out of shape like myself. I needed to stand within five inches of each handle to feel a slight effort. I suppose I could use hand weights instead, but then it would be difficult to hold the wiimotes. I could buy more difficult bands, but it seems a a stronger one should have been included. A toddler would find this exercise band too easy.A lot of accuracy depends on the position of the leg band that holds the control, but I found out it slips off my pants easily. So, I was often pulling it up and trying to make it tighter, which affects my score.I found it confusing to determine what to follow: the trainer, my mii, the visual graph or the voice command. My mii didn't reflect my actual moves or timing.It seems far more efficient to just use an exercise video."
3,Hope Next Version Will Be Better,"This product feels like it was rushed out before it was ready. The biggest issue is timing. Your avatar moves before or after you move. Some exercises (like lunges) have you hold the position for a second longer on one side than the other. The next rep is either rushed after the last one, or they make you wait too long (and then you get scolded for jumping the gun). The trainer's encouraging sound bites have no connection to what you are doing. (I got a ""Right on!"" for adjusting the leg strap.) One last irritation: on Bentover Rows With Triceps Kickbacks, they have your avatar look around helplessly at the end of every rep.I suggest you wait for the next version and hope they've ironed out these glitches. Oh, and Bob Greene is creepy."
2,It could be great,"This fitness product is so close to being excellent if only.... Good variety of workout excercises, much harder routines than WII Fit, and good animated venues, however the product does not recognize the signals from the WII handheld devices in some of its excercises. I can't get it to work with squats at all. In others it takes a long time to receive/evaluate the signal even though it shows your avitar having completed the move and then it ""yells"" at you for taking to long. It is so close to being an excellent workout product. If you can live without some of the routines then go for it."
4,A super workout,At first when I bought this for my wife I thought I'd be able to do it and not even break a sweat. First day 13 minute workout and I was dead wrong. It is an amazing thing and I can't wait to tomorrow's workout. My 7 year old also has a good time with it.
2,So BORING.,"I bought this after much research, because so many people liked the variety of workouts, etc. I'm going to pass it along to someone who will enjoy it more than I will.POSITIVE-Good how-to videos-Good tracking-Pleasant coaches-Lots of different workouts-pre-set 30-day workoutNEGATIVES-It's dull. Really, really, really dull. That's why I don't exercise in the first place.(example: when you run, you run on a track. Why can't it be the countryside, or a race, or something interesting?)-I haven't found a way to skip exercises that I'm not supposed to do. (ie my knee problems won't allow deep knee bends. They're in many of the workouts, and there's not a way to skip past.)-Although there are many music choices, none of them really got my blood pumping.Tons of people love this product. However, if you're the kind of person that needs to be entertain, that needs to have her mind taken off of the monotony of exercise, then this is not a product for you."
2,Game Freezes,"I really enjoyed this when I first got it I've owned it a little over 90 days. It keeps freezing up on me, telling me to follow the instructor which I'm doing. I thought batteries, so I changed them, I thought, where I was standing so I moved, I thought, the WII bar so I've adjusted it. Nothing worked, yet all my other programs work fine. I've attempted to email EA, call EA, and have had no response. I feel this is poor customer service and a bad CD."
3,Great except for one BIG flaw.,"I like the product and the thought behind the workouts. It really does make you sweat and the routines build in complexity in a good way.However, the transition between biceps curls and shoulder presses is ridiculous. You can literally spend minutes at a time making tiny wrist adjustments and then holding still, making tiny wrist adjustments and holding still, trying desperately to hit the precise position the game wants - all the while being scolded by the game for not doing it right. There is no way to snap the game out of it and move on.This isn't an exercise you encounter infrequently, and it becomes immensely frustrating at times. There is no way to count on a quick 30-minute workout if this exercise is lurking in your path. Did they not play test it?This would otherwise be a solid four - even four-plus - stars. It's unbelievable that EA Sports would release such an otherwise terrific game with such a huge, annoying flaw."
4,Active but lacking,"The game is a workout but you have to know the basics for proper form. It lacks a good core (stomach) workout. Mixing it with the Wii fit program is an excellent idea.I really like the way the 30-day challenge is set up with ""rest"" days. Overall great workout and fun."
3,EA Sports Active,"I like this system, the only problem is the fact that the nunchuck always has to be plugged in. It definitely gets in the way sometimes."
4,"Video is good, leg strap is lousy","I've been enjoying the workout immensely and definitely feel some results in my shoulders and arms. I do agree with some of the posters saying it's a little cumbersome to be constantly changing things like the resistance band, leg strap, etc. Oh, and I hate the leg strap. It constantly slips out of place and shifts around, no matter how tight I put it. I've resorted to sliding the nunchuck down the front of my shorts leg and my waistband does a great job of holding the nunchuck in place. It's a lot faster than taking off that darn leg strap, too!"
5,Very Good Workout,I am just starting to exercise and try to get in shape. I went for the 30 day challenge which will be over this Thursday. It is a great way to start (I picked the easiest level). I will make my own custom workout next time. It isn't too hard for a beginner to get in shape. I love the on screen follow me instructor. That just makes it even easier to follow along.
2,Needs many improvements,"This is a better workout than Wii Fit. It needs some improvements though. The leg strap falls off easily and when it's tight enough to stay up, feels like a tourniqet. The cord between the controls keeps getting tangled and is a bit of a hazard. The sensors are almost too sensitive and the workout stops when it feels you aren't doing the move properly, even if you are. I find the pace a bit aggrevating too. It's too slow, not in time with the music and just doesn't flow. I wish I hadn't spent the money on this one."
3,Works with problems,I would like this better if was easier to use real weights instead of the bands...the band just does not work that well for me. I would also like to have a choice of different warm-ups other than jogging. It is hard on my knees to do that but walking in place brings up all sorts of annoying prompts. I would rather like that option to continue through the entire program and have the option to pause myself instead of having to stop and go through all the screens every time. How about a ten second delay between exercises that give me the option to pause at that time.
4,Great workout even if you are a beginner!,"I recently bought a Wii, but don't have the balance board so I was looking for a workout that I could do without it. This game is perfect, and if you do have a balance board it will incorporate that as well. I haven't worked out in a long time, and I found that I could keep up with this. It has different levels so I started on the easy level. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks, but so far I really like it!"
2,No option for left-handed players!,"Not fair! You can't play tennis if you're left-handed. I looked on the EA games website and they said that you can't do it! You have to play backwards! InWii Sportsyou can choose if you want to play lefty or righty for everything. That's good, especially if you play baseball righty and tennis lefty. This was a BIG disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Not really a game,"EA Sports Active will give you a great workout. However, it is not a game, nor do many of its workouts come in a sort of game packaging. I'd wanted to set it up to play through games, that also gave a workout, but it doesn't really work that way - at least not easily. For the most part the 'game' is full of workouts with very good examples given by the Wii instructors."
5,Great Workout!,"EA Sports Active is a great workout game. It can be set to 3 different levels, Easy, Medium and Hard. The 30 Day Challenge is a gradual, comfortable way to get in shape. You can turn the volume off and workout to your own music. All instructions are demonstrated visually on screen. There are over 50 different routines which keeps things interesting. The actual games like tennis, baseball, basketball and boxing are especially fun. You don't have to get weighed everyday like with Wii Fit. It allows for rest days. I was able to quit my gym membership and stay home to work out. The only weaknesses are that it doesn't work the abs and sometimes the controls don't work perfectly. It really is like having your own personal trainer at home!"
4,Great service,"Product arrived on time and in great shape. Game is interactive, but not as good as going to the gym for a work out"
5,In Better Shape Already,Who knew a video game could give me the kind of work out that leaves me sore for the next 3 days? For the price of only two months worth of membership at my old gym! I would definitely recommend this game.
5,This is a workout!,While Wii Fit is fun...this is a WORKOUT! I've tried most of the workout games and come back to EA Sports Active for a real workout. I've got EA sports active more workouts too - both of are fabulous! Definitely worth the money.PROS:A great work out!Easy to follow directionsCONS:Almost no ab workout (need to get more workouts for that)resistance band is pretty weak
5,Absoulutely Love This workout,"Originally I was looking to buy the new Wii Fit when I came across EA active. It looked to be more intense and I liked the idea of the leg strap ( so you can't cheat or slow down).I was right. It is more intense and a lot of fun! One thing I absolutely love is its like circuit training and you have an audible trainer and beeps , so if your doing an exercise where you can not see the TV you can keep up by sound.I enjoyed working out with this product so much I went on to buy the ""active more workouts"".They have added a warm up and cool off and to me I think this is greatly needed.This is not an easy workout in my opinion. I am a regular at the gym etc and find this challenging. Great Job EA Sports!It has a little bit of everything and you wont get bored..... Fabulous game ;)"
4,Fitness Fun,Great workout routine from Wii. Like having a trainer to assist with workout and motivation. Work with the routines and when ready add addtional workout programs later. Great way to exercise annd have a sense of accomlishment.
3,Got some glitches!,"One major flaw in this program is that it does not allow you to designate whether you are left or right handed. This makes it difficult in some of the sports, like tennis. In addition, the program is too sensitive to the position of the WII remote and nunchuck. If you are a fraction off in pointing the device, the game halts till you correct it. If you have small hands, like I do, it is difficult to hold the WII remote in an exact position. Also, you cannot choose the eye color when you put together your likeness so if you have blue eyes, the likeness is not going to look at all like you."
4,Lovin' our Wii Active,"My wife and I have been using this for two weeks. Results are great! We're maintaining a low cal diet and each of us do the 30 day challenge every day. We both have about 50 lbs we need to lose so we are far from being ""in shape"". The exercises are becoming a little easier each day. Unlike a tread mill or stationary bicycle, it is not boring. By constantly changing what we are doing we give attention to cardio, lower body and upper body. on the off days and on weekends we like to do some of the custom workouts together. Only wish we could do the 30 day challenge simultaneously. Some of the routines are very picky about how you hold the remote but that is to be expected I suppose with this remote technology. Best purchase of 2010 so far!"
4,THE definitive Empire Strikes Back release,"Charles Gerhardt and the NPO released many CDs on RCA Victor, mainly of golden age film scores, but also a Star Wars/Close Encounters CD and Return of the Jedi. For whatever reason, RCA passed on Gerhardt's recording of Empire Strikes Back, but no fear, Varese Sarabande picked it up. I love all of the Gerhardt recordings, and this is my favorite of the three. While it doesn't have all the cues that the 1993 Anthology or 1997 sppecial editions had, it still has most of the major themes and is performed superbly by the National Philharmonic.George Korngold (producer) and Charles Gerhardt (conductor) did a huge favor for film score fans with the Classic Film Score series, and of course the Star Wars trilogy recordings."
3,This isn't a [SOUNDTRACK] of the music.,"All of the music on this album is the motion pictures SCORE, but isn't the motion picture SOUNDTRACK performed by the London Symphony Orchestra for the actual motion picture. Mentioning SOUNDTRACK in your description of this album, even when you also refer to it elsewhere as from the motion picture SCORE, is confusing and misleading."
3,a joyride,This movie was absolutely good movie.The film is meant to be a joyride. Music is strictly okay. Emraan tries hard to infuse life in JAWANI DIWANI.
1,Buyer Beware,"Be careful when buying. We received a completeley different item then we thougt we were ordering. Instrad of the the Tradtional Spode Tea saucer illlustrated, we received a ndiferent spode pattern and not he traditional one."
3,"bad sound quality, pretty good music","Most of this music is pretty good, however, even the highest-fidelity tracks on this album are not much above bootleg quality. It is often a jumble of instruments and voices, but usually good enough to still enjoy. If you're going to get this, get Yes and Time and a Word so you have a reference as to how these songs sound. The listen to Something's Coming and use your imagination to enhance the album and see how his early lineup would have sounded if you were actually at a concert."
4,A must-have for every Yes fan... and every jazz fan!,"A must-have for every Yes fan... and every jazz fan!This is pure pre-nostalgy. This is how it all started.The genuine, raw and crispy sound of the very early Yes. Very jazz-inspired and probably quite unique for the time.Before some of the songs, you even hear the original presentations from radio reporters.So if you're a Yes fan, or even a fan of jazz: get this! It is uniquely nostalgically interesting music!"
3,not what i had expected,"I rated this book as average. I think Gantar whines way too much to open the book and makes lame excuses for his actions while simultaneously accepting responsibility for his guilt and coming clean. It introduces the question of telling the truth for the sake of honor or lying to save your butt. Toward the end of the book I think there was a little too much talk about Gantar's ""finding god"". Overall; good ideas, strong conflict, but not well written or thought out in my opinion. This has a ""Christian"" theme to it, though you may not realize it until the end of the book."
4,Great Western Movie Music,"I introduced my wife to western movies in general, and John Wayne movies in particular after we were married. We've got quite a few on DVD, and she's been asking for the soundtracks for several years. When I found this CD, I bought it and hoped that it would be a fairly decent reproduction. In a word, it's excellent! The CD contains all of the music that we would want from this movie, and the quality is superb. Although I've been buying DVDs of these movies, I wasn't aware that anyone would actually produce a soundtrack for something this old. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who enjoys this movie and music genre."
2,"Disappointed! Badly cropped for false ""Widescreen Effect""","BUYER BEWARE: This movie is a must-own classic, but be warned that this version has been cut -very poorly, by the way- (foreheads, chins cut off, etc. It's enough to annoy long-time fans) to seem like a widescreen edition, for which one doesn't actually exist. The original made-for-tv movie was meant to be viewed in full screen format. I'm going to try to return this copy for a better version."
3,Book helpful but more needed,"The book may tell you how to become an engineer but it does not point to available jobs. There are many websites that claim to offer jobs but it often remains difficult. At, [ ... ] you can find jobs dealing with this specific career field. At [ ... ] , they only have jobs from employer websites and offer far more jobs than other job boards."
2,don't bother,"A waste of time and money.Poorly animated.Not appropriate for the targeted age. Buttons to advance pages are not highlighted. It's not clear when an activity ends or how to advance to the next page.The story writing activity is horrendous, incoherent, and filled with non-sequitors. The premade stories illustrate this perfectly.The pinball game is too hard and has no educational value.The card writing activity is too limited, and again not clear how to advance through the different steps. The shape matching activity is noisy, gives insufficient reward for completing the task and doesn't indicate clearly when the child has completed all the tasks. The music activity is confusing, insufficiently interactive, although the music itself is high quality. Overall, this software has a few good ideas, but some are just plain bad and boring. It also suffers from poor execution and obviously insufficient play testing. The Jumpstart programs are a little better."
4,Land Before Time ...,"My kid likes it ... 'nuf said.It works on my older PC (866 Mhz, Windows XP, all stock, nothing special) ... does not need a graphic accelerator 3D card (like many other programs these days).GMB"
4,DK Millenium World Atlas,"This is a superb resource in the DK tradition. Coverage is comprehensive, Juxtaposition of maps with satellite images at the same scale is very effective, and immediately alters one's geographic understanding. The maps are beautifully rendered. My only complaint is that the satellite images don't quite reach the razor sharp resolution and stunning color of National Geographic's Satellite atlas. DK's satellite images seem flatter, with more noticeable pixelization and slightly muddier colors. On balance, though, this book is an excellent value."
2,The Natural World,This atlas concentrates on the physical world rather than on what man has done or is doing. Much of the book is dedicated to mostly green satellite images of the earth. There are few thematic maps and little statistical information. Individual country maps are surrounded with little photographs and some non-probing information laid out in magazine format. The arrangement is beautiful.
4,"A Beautiful ""British"" Atlas",This is a beautiful atlas for correlating the natural geography of the land with political features as we know it. The level of detail allows for garnering the big picture of the world without being overwhelmed.I have only one complaint and it is that the British names are still used for places around the world that are recognized internationally as something other. One example is Lake Turkana in Kenya that is listed as Lake Rudolf. This depicts the imperialistic attitude that the British still hold toward thier former colonies and the utter disregards the new countires have to self rule.
5,The best world atlas ever published,"I thoroughly enjoy reading this atlas--it's absolutely amazing. If you're like me and won't be satisfied with some average atlas, spend the few extra bucks on this one--it may be the only atlas you ever need to buy. Totally amazing."
1,Not for PAL?,"I can't explain why it happened, but the bottom line is that this cable never worked for me, although Amazon sent me a second cable after I asked them if it fits my PAL Wii.My question to the provider was not answered, so I had to return both cables."
3,Global Leadership - the Next Generation,No double that the content is very good and useful in the real world. Unfortunately the print quality is so bad that it makes scanning difficult. Some parts are almost smudgy.
1,Better books available,"Unless you want very simple beginning cross stich, you will not like this book. The designs are unrealistic and uninteresting. A good deal of the book is taken up by the history of the art form and even that is not well written. Save your money there are better books out there."
2,Not a good value,"I was disappointed with this hose. I wanted a flexible hose and this one was stiff and even retained the kinks from being in the original packaging. The lifetime guarantee is nice and the fittings seem solid, but I know there are better hoses out there."
2,Flexible like a cheap vinyl garden hose,"Hose would not hang straight down in the shower, was constantly in the way, seemed to be a cheap grade vinyl hose colored to look like chrome. Returned, had to pay postage since it was a direct from buyer purchase."
3,Typical Black/Chrome Handshower Hose,"This is a fairly average Black/Chrome hand shower hose. I ordered this product based off the product image which shows a black and chrome hose with a smooth exterior, the hose I received is black and chrome but has a ribbed exterior like the hoses included with most new mid priced hand showers. The last hose I owned with a ribbed exterior was difficult to keep clean so I will be returning this one. I ordered a Hansgrohe Techniflex B Hose in Chrome which I know has a smooth exterior."
4,Nice product,Doesn't double the size of your camera. Nicely finished. Wouldn't fit anything bigger than a Kodak M753.
3,Weird dimensions internal vs external,"I got this case because the internal dimensions fit my camera perfectly. What I failed to realize is that the external dimensions are bigger. Generally external dimensions account for like the padding of the case and the material, but for this case, the external height dimension is just air. So when the case closed, I ended up having this gap of air on top which I didn't like. I couldn't fit the case around my camera since the magnetic clasp is a one setting type of clasp. Some other cases have velcro so you can make it tighter.I also didn't like it that the sides aren't really covered. So it's a lot easier to get lint and pocket crap on your camera. I ended up returning this case and getting the Lowepro Napoli 5. I would definitely invest the few extra dollars for one of the Napoli cases.The one thing I do say that is nice about this case (if it fit your camera well) is that it has some nice straps if you want to wear it around your neck."
5,Tamrac Soft Camera Case for Subcompact Cameras,"I have just purchased a subcompact digital camera. Since I don't want to carry around a large camera case, I was looking for a small case that would not take up a lot of space in a purse but that would still protect the lens and, more importantly, the LCD screen. A few soft cases I had seen did not have side panels to keep the camera from sliding out of the case. The Tamrac did, and came in a nice blue color, matching my camera. I am very pleased with this case."
4,Perfect for the Purse,"This is perfect for keeping a digital camera in your purse. It's also a perfect fit for a Nikon Coolpix L15. If you just need something to store your camera in that's already padded (like a purse), this might be the best option since it's not bulky. The only thing I would change is to add more room for extra SD cards."
3,Worthwhile CD but missing too much score.,"The songs on this CD offer as much as you can expect from a 1991 movie set in Brooklyn. There is a strong feel of Latino/Rap that dates the CD more than the film. You will probably like a few of the songs but you'll be too embarresed to play it in the company of friends.David Michael Frank's vigorous score only gets 3 tracks worth of space here, a rather odd choice for Varese Sarabande to have 8 songs and only 3 intrumentals tho. He created several cool themes and atmospheric cues. But each and everyone of them only gets one exersize. A real shame. Track 10 will sound terrific for anyone who has a great speaker set-up. The heartbeat bass will bring the house down.I doubt it wil happen but it wouldn't be a bad move for Varese to rerelease this with the full score from the movie and ditch those grating early 90's tunes."
2,Only a few good songs...,I bought this after watching the movie several time. No Sleep till Brooklyn is NOT on this CD. That was a major despoilment. Only 3 good songs. If you are a Steven Segal fan you 'll still enjoy it.Anthony
4,Cute toy--for older babies,"I bought this toy for my nine-month-old daughter. Like all Melissa and Doug products in my experience, it is well made and very cute. It requires a bit more motor skills than I thought it was going to...so I think it would suit older babies (18 months?) better. The little legs and head tuck under the turtle, and then you can flip them out. They're very sturdy--a bit too heavy/tight for little babies to move. The appendages don't move quickly, either, so they don't suit a quick ""peek-a-boo"" move. My daughter likes to kind of push it around now, and I think she'll be able to take fuller advantage of it as she gets older. My six-year-old daughter and my three-year-old nephew were interested in it and wanted to play with it, too...so it does arouse curiosity."
1,Choking Hazard,"My nine month old son almost died chocking on a piece of wood that broke off the turtle's leg while he was playing with it. The toy appears to be made from a solid piece of wood, but it is actually made out of glued wood pieces that easily chips off in form of sharp wood splinters."
5,Lavender Blue and Clear Crystal earrings,"These earrings are lovely, they have a great sparkle to them, especially in the sunlight.They made a wonderful Christmas present for my friend. She likes them very much."
3,Pleased,"These were a gift for a 13 year old and she seemed to like them so I'm pleased overall.However, the description says Swarovski Crystal, but it looks like plastic to me.Not quite as pretty in person as they look online.I would have given it four stars, but felt misled by the description."
5,My New Favorites,"Lavender Blue And Clear Swarovski Crystal Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5"" Long Dangle EarringsThese earrings are so beautiful that everyone notices them and comments on their beauty!"
5,Very pretty,"These earrings are just as pictured. The subtle differences in colors between the crystals are lovely, and the tones are beautiful. They were a gift, and the relative who received them really loved them. I would definitely order again for another gift."
5,Very Pretty,The item came in a bag in a nice box. Packaging was nice as this was given as a gift. They were really pretty and sparkly despite some of the negative comments on the item and my friend absolutely loved them! I almost didn't want to give them to her and might have to order myself a pair =) They are nice to dress up or dress down. Great buy!
3,it's okay,not that big as i thought through looking picture. and the shape is not exactly the same with the picture. but the cut is beautiful.
5,FABULOUS GEMS AND JEWELRY AT A FANTASTIC PRICE,"My husband was the one that actually ordered these beautiful earrings for me. They are breathlessly beautiful and priced far below comparable jewelry I have seen in the jewelry cases at Penny's or even Walmart. If you men out there are looking for an inexpensive gift that has all of the looks of expensive, buy 'em and fool 'em!"
5,Crystal earrings,"These were bought as a gift for my daughter to match an outfit for a special occasion, and she loved them. They are well-made with beautiful color and hang perfectly on her ears. When she wore them, I noticed how they caught the light and framed her face with a soft touch of elegance."
4,Look more expensive,"They are small-ish, so that is why I give them four stars, but otherwise they look nice and they even look more expensive than they actually are."
3,Blue could be bluer ....,"Nice earrings, but the colors aren't as distinctive as they are in the photo. The blue is quite pale and doesn't stand out against the orchid and clear stones."
5,Lavender blue and clear Swarovski Crystal earrings,I was very pleased with the earrings. They are beautiful and I received many compliments on them. The color is great!
5,Excellent Jewelry,I bought these earrings as a gift to my friend. She loved them so much. Great quality and an affordable price. I don't think you can find anything like this anywhere else than Gem Avenue.
5,earrings,"these earrings are prettier than the picture. they pick up the light quite nicely. the gemstones give off a warm glow. would compliment dressy, or casual apparell. thank you for a nice product. would recommend you to anybody!"
5,Quite Lovely and Delicate Looking.,"Bought for my Sister as a present ""just because"" and they are beautiful.She loved them. Don't know if they are real crystal...but for the price, they sure are pretty."
5,Great with Tanzanite,"I bought these while searching for ""white gold"" tanzanite earrings. These look very beautiful with a tanzanite pendant that I already had so I wear these instead of the tanzanite earrings! I have owned them for over a year and they still sparkle beautifully."
3,Smaller than expected.,"I was expecting a cluster of crystals that were individually dangling to maximize movement. They hung straight down from a center post. They sparkle and look good- but I expected much more after I read all of the reviews for them. I would not pay full price for these, but I paid $18.99, and feel slightly ripped off. I'm beginning to think that most of the reviews are fake, since this is my fourth purchase from Gem Avenue."
2,eh.. seen better,When i received my earrings in the mail i was not so excited as when I saw these compared to when I saw it on the web. They are good quality and cute sparkly earrings but they are definitely not genuine swarovski crystals. more like glass.
2,"Pretty earrings, but poor quality","I only wore mine for 2 hours, the crystals fell off on both earrings! I love the colors and the length, too bad the quality isn't as good."
2,The Photo is Misleading,"These earrings seemed gorgeous in the photo, but when I got them in the mail they looked cheap - and not much like the picture. They don't dangle the way they seemed to in the photo, either. They're small plastic beads on a wire. I got them as a gift, but didn't give them to the person they were intended for - I plan to give them to my 14 yr old niece for her birthday, instead. They're more suited to a pre-teen/teenager than a woman."
2,too small,the picture makes the earrings look more brilliant and bigger than they actually are. They are a gift but i am disappointed.
5,Ear Rings,My grand daughters loved the ear rings for their color and elegance and they treasured them. They told me that the shape was awfully good.
1,B o r i n g,I have read numerous Doctorow novels and was generally satisfied by them but WORLD'S FAIR was a boring waste of time. I have yet to finish it.
5,very cute and informative,This book reads somewhat like a comic book. It teaches children the behind the scenes look at the making of a newspaper.This book made my son want to make his own newspaper with his Dad!The pictures in the book are also very cute!
5,From a healthier time for newspapers,"This book is well written and does a good job introducing kids to the basic concepts of how a newspaper works. That said, it was written in 1990 and is a little dated. Skunks produce copy on typewriters. The squirrels literally cut up articles and paste them to fit. And there's nary a mention of the Internet. Made a newspaper reporter reading it to his kids nostalgic. Perhaps his favorite line was the rabbit editor telling her reporter ""This story needs to be longer."" He doesn't believe he's ever heard that in his newsroom."
3,Too wordy,"This book's story is decent, and the artwork is great, but the writing feels a little amateurish. The author uses many more words (particularly adjectives) than are necessary, which gets in the way of an otherwise nice little tale. Do you really have to say ""caterwauling"" when ""meowing"" would do?My son is too young to read, so I just skip most of the words, but he's starting to catch on and ask me to read all the words--what a shame that they aren't better written."
3,"so it's ok to say ""hell"" in G-rated movies?","I'm screening movies that a friend gave me to see what might be suitable to show my students. I looked up this movie online, saw that it was Hallmark, and rated G, and thought, Great, good start, so I threw it in the VCR and started it up. To my dismay (not a deal-breaker, but it bugs me) in the first 5 minutes of the movie, the dad tells the boy he played a ""hell of a game"". That's just not necessary, and I teach international students, so I hate being put in the position of having to explain anything that I wouldn't say myself and that we don't want to hear them saying either. Why do producers feel it's ok to slip in stuff like this and still give it a G rating?"
2,Better on the picture,I bought this shoe because I thought it had an unique style. I wear a six and this was a little big (and a little wide) for my foot. My heel kept slipping out of them and the only thing that helped keep my foot in was the cheap elastic band going across the shoe. The white is more of an off white with a pearl to it and an orange peel texture. I opened the box but was completly underwhelmed. I returned the shoe. IT also wasn't comfortable to wear or walk in.
5,Good product for the price,I bought this TV/DVD combo as an extra TV in bright room. I have it connected to coax cable through a VCR. I get a very good picture from satellite and antennae through the cable connection with no bleeding of normal black tones. The picture is crisp and clear.I like the 4/3 screen for broadcast viewing as that is still the prevalent ratio out there. Probably not the best choice for mainly movie viewing. But the built in DVD player is nice and one less component in my limited space.I did alot of pricing and looking and am very pleased with the quality of this item and it's capabilities for the price.
1,DVD player doesn't last,"I was initially happy with this TV due to its nice picture, size of unit and weight. The convenience of a DVD player built right made it look clean and less hassle with cords and hookup. I didn't use the DVD player that much but when I went to use it after the 90 day warranty, it would not read the disk. I found a repair shop and was told the whole DVD unit needed to be replaced but only the part was covered. The labor of $150.00 was not covered. I called the Sylvania company and they said ""Sorry, we can't help you."" I opted not to get it repaired because I could buy a DVD player for around $50.00. I would not recommend this TV."
4,good product for the price,Very good quality product for the price we paid. Nice package with good features.
3,father of the bride,"I am having trouble with it skipping often, right out of the package. No marks on CD that I can see. Musically, it is one of my favs."
1,"Awful, just awful.","For the most part, this soundtrack reminded me most distictly of the background music for a Tom and Jerry chase scene. The tracks generally range from 30 to 80 seconds in length, and seem to repeat at least once every three minutes. Honestly, the only reason this soundtrack is worthy of even one star is its adoption of Pachelbel's Canon and The Way You Looked Tonight, neither of which were created by the mastermind behind the rest of this circus-like album. Instead of spending your good ol' greenbacks on this audio version of a hampster-wheel, consider letting the four neighbor kids fingerpaint your Volvo with ketchup and mustard. Ok, maybe this was a little harsh...however: this soundtrack does well to complement the movie, but nothing else. It is wholly unable to stand on its own merit, and coincidentally results in a bloody headache rather than a positive listening experience."
2,Where's the rest of the music?!!,"I bought this soundtrack assuming it contained all the music from the movie--so I'll take the blame for not getting what I expected. I should have paid more attention to the contents and the length of the CD. What's there is good, but it certainly is NOT the soundtrack one would expect to get. Where are all those ""oldies"" that made Father of the Bride such an entertaining movie? And why is such a short CD (less than half the length of most CDs) priced right up there with much longer CDs? Surely there's a ""real"" FOTB soundtrack out there somewhere! This one should be called ""Very, Very Short Tidbits from Father of the Bride""!"
5,"Don't be fooled by the ""negative reviews""","This CD is not meant for those who want lyrical songs only. I am using #1 for my wedding as the ceremony entrance....and it's beautiful. Also, if you like the song ""The Way You Look Tonight"" the version by Steve Tyrell is wonderful. It's a sentimental CD....for those of us who saw it when we were younger and dreamed of the day we were getting married. Each song has a special moment connected to the movie."
2,Where's the Rest of the Music?,"The tracks on the CD are good, but I really wanted the entire soundtrack--all those songs from the past that made the movie so much fun. My fault; I should have read the cover more carefully, or at least have added the track times. You don't get much music for your money."
4,The Bungalow Experience,"Living in a bungalow is a unique experience. We live in an older(1924)bungalow. Remodeling is always a challenge -- how do you maintain the original character of the house, especially with the solid iron four-foot bathtub that nobody can move. This book was very helpful -- at least we know we have been on the right track."
3,"Okay, not exactly what we were looking for","We were looking for ideas to redo our 70's redo bathroom in our 20's house, but we didn't really find much of what were looking for in this book. The like titled kitchen book on comparison, was much better."
3,It's great if you are looking to restore plumbing.....,"But if you are looking for ideas of how the past looked---this is a limited source. It has a handful of historic homes with numerous photographs--toilet on one page, the tub 20 pages later and a light fixture 20 pages beyond that. The photos are great, but I live in Los Angeles (the birthplace of bungalow living) and I expected a lot more pictures of even the most architecturally insignificant homes that displayed wonderful examples of tile work, fixtures, etc. It is a book more for how to live with the old stuff rather than a book that glorifies the old stuff!"
4,Waterproof your book and take a bath!,"Considering the fact that the bathroom was still an area being perfected when bungalows were built, this book displays an insightful history into bathroom technology, both at the time and throughout history. As well, it gives reality-based examples for a bungalow-phile to follow in order to mould their bathroom after those of the era, allowing for the advancement modernity. A well-researched, well-done book."
5,essential reading,Jane Powell's books are the gold standard for bungalow reference. This book was critical for making sure I got my 1911 master bath remodel done the right way. Still a work in progress.
3,Beat by the internet,"Unfortunatley (or fortunately depending on the perspective), most of the images and information in the rather expensive book can now all be found on the internet."
2,Too historically obsessive for my new Craftsman home,"If you want to be historically accurate, this book is for you. The author gives examples of ""Obsessive Restoration"" and a ""Compromise Solution"" for each element of restoring a bungalow bathroom. However, even the compromise was too obsessive for me. In addition, the author wasted way too many pages discussing the history of bathrooms, which is irrelevant to me. Her companion book, ""Bungalow Kitchens"" is much of the same. I just built a new Craftsman home, and my goal was to build a new home with historic influences, so what I was hoping for were suggestions on how to incorporate modern materials and modern conveniences to achieve a bungalow look. Obviously that was not the author's goal -- she's all about keeping the historical accuracy. This book has lots of illustrative photos, but they all look dingy and stodgy to me. I was looking more for something to show me how to bring bungalow style to my home without it looking outdated and old."
3,"ok, not enough variety of styles of bathrooms shown","I needed a good book to review lots of craftsman/bungalow bathrooms as we now own a 1911 bungalow and are restoring the bathroom. My husband is a tilesetter and I worked in architecture for years.I expected a larger, more creative and diverse selection of bathrooms than what is contained in this book. It's best to buy several books on the subject rather than put all your hopes on this one. I'm not happy to have spent $23."
5,A must for those restoring or remodeling a bungalow bathroom,"This book is a wealth of information for anyone restoring or remodeling a bungalow bathroom! All the information I have been searching for is right here in one book. We demolished a BAD 70's remodel, and are in the process of restoring our bath to it's original (1926) condition. This book covers it all beautifully!Especially helpful are the sections labeled 'Obsessive restoration' and 'Compromise solution'. These give you choices on how historically accurate you would like to be. These sections have kept my husband and I out of marriage counseling!I would highly recommend this book. I liked this book so much I want to get the others available from these authors."
4,Good Read,"This was a good read, sweet story. I really enjoy Rida Allen's writing. Maybe not my favorite of this authors works, but a good read. Glad I got it."
1,Not working anymore,"I came home tonight to a TV that no longer works. Purchased 1/17/05 and no workie 6/8/05 - RIPOFF!!!! I see that someone else had the same issue - mine shows the ""Standby Timer"" light flashes 5x and then pauses and then 5x and pauses, etc. Sony CS says needs repair. 5 MONTHS! COME ON! $600 down the tubes - labor is on me... I have a TV upstairs that I have had for 20+ years - not a SONY. I have been a loyal SONY customer for 15 years.... gotta wonder. Take a hard look at this TV."
3,wish I would have seen text,"Overall, for daily TV viewing, I like this TV. Picture is okay, sound is fine. However, I do have a major problem with it - TEXT! I don't mean the text like scrolling at the bottom of the screen on News Channels or during commercials, but the text that makes up the score of the game you're watching and text overlays like that. For some reason, it really looks bad. When you turn on Sony's ""enhancement"" for text, it looks worse, IMO. Another time I notice this is during video games (PS2 specifically).Would I buy this model again? Probably not. I like it for normal viewing, but this TV was bought to be a gameroom TV (sports and console games, mainly) so the text crap is annoying."
3,Good film from Quebec,"An enjoyable film about the life of a family with great acting, cinematograpy and period details. I do think that it dragged a bit during the last half an hour. Also, despite being a movie where a large part is about the character coming to terms with himself and his sexuality, the movie is rather timid when it comes to any onscreen depictions of homsexuality. As seems to be all too often in films that deal with gay themes, the characters always tend to have their heterosexual relations get more screentime. In this case, it was with the homely girl next door, a move that didn;t even seem entirely plausible.That said, this is a great depiction of a large Quebecois family. You'll never listen to Patsy Cline in the same way again."
2,Rusted metals,"Hi,I bought this for a present, but the metal pieces came al rusted and worn out. Crystals are amazing, but what was supposed to be Silver is all dark. I cannot give it as a present looking like this.. I know Silver might get dark IN TIME, if it's in contact with skin, due to body grease and dust but not out of the box.I uploaded an image about this.It's not the first time I buy stuff from this guys, but seems to be like a lottery, hoping your product to come as described.thx."
5,Elegant and sophisticated,"I was looking for a pair of earrings that I could wear to work but also wear out to dinner. These are the perfect earrings and complement any outfit. The crystals are beautiful and look like they cost a fortune. Really great product, now I need to order the other available colors."
5,Love Love Love,"Love them I get complimentsSCER008 Stylish Clear Swarovski Crystal Cluster Sterling Silver Lever back 1"" Long Dangle Earringson them all the time"
4,"Packed with journal articles - not exactly an ""Encyclopaedia""","If you're too busy to visit a library for Chinese-English or English-Chinese translation papers, this is the one to stay in your collection. This is not a subject by subject encyclopaedic book, rather it's a one-stop book that contains categorized articles.I usually look for the subject I need and in most cases I can get at least one or two published articles about the issue that I'm interested in.Most articles already appeared in other journals. This compliation gives a handy all-in-one academic reference to a comprehensive list of translation-related issues.Mind you this is not a very new book, but quite worth it if you need to do substantial research work in the subject matter."
3,a curat's egg - good in parts,Some very interesting articles with lots of useful information but it needs revision as there is some material that is not necessarily on the topic.
2,How ironic !!,"Georges Delerue composed over 150 motion picture scores in his long career -- yet this mediocre effort won an Academy Award !! The music varies from downright awful to fairly good; yet never APPROACHES Delerue`s real potential. This CD remains in print, while his GREAT music -- FAR more deserving of awards -- remain either UNRELEASED on CD ( "" American Friends ""; "" The Escape Artist ""; "" Our Mother`s House ""; "" Women in Love ""; "" Beaches ""; "" Joe Versus the Volcano "") or deleted ( "" Chouans !; "" Le Mepris ""; "" La Revolution Franaise "" -- possibly his BEST score of all time !!; and many others.) A prime example of how an artist`s best work remains supressed and how few people really care. Criminal."
2,Religious beliefs are trumped by homosexual beliefs?,"Homosexuality for a christian young person who does not share the beliefs of this book will find it's very one sided, and at one point acutally states that God hates homosexuals. This could not be farther from the truth. Ofcourse in society you will find extreme opinions against homosexuals, but many, many religions/church bodies today embrace, pray and are very loving towards homosexuals, even though they do not agree with their choice of lifestyle. Christians, nor God practice ""hate"". Intersting that it's o.k. to say God or Christians ""hate"", but if someone says I hate homosexuals, people of color, different race ect, thats called ""hate speech"". Hummmmm? Double standards here? A simple clear encouragement to both sides of beliefs on homosexuality to work together, and help each other understand acceptance is o.k. No one on either side has to hate."
1,Very Disappointing,"I love all the other Bernie Rhodenbarr books. In this one the author bastardizes Bernie, which is a surprising and painful thing to someone who is a big fan. I don't want to give away specifics, because those Bernie fans who have not read the book don't need to know.Fictional characters are very fragile. I believe the author did this because he no longer wanted to write Bernie Rhodenbarr books.--David"
2,"Weakest of the ""Burglar"" books","Burglar on the Prowl"" starts off strong, but loses steam about 2/3 of the way through. Block recycles the ""suspects all in the same room"" ending from one of the early novels in this series and the the book finishes on a less than satisfying note.The ""Burglar"" books have always relied on loose plotting that strains credibility and oddball characters. The smartass humor is there, along with the eccentric oddly named characters, but the result seems labored and seems to recycle elements from past books (names, plot devices); there are even footnoted entries that direct you to other books in the series that explain why he has a Mondrian, etc.I'd hoped that the long drought since the last ""Burglar"" book was a good sign, particularly because Block seems to have revived the Scudder series after a series of clinkers. May be the next one will be better........"
4,Great old Block,"Good old Bernie the Burglar - I dont know if I over-identify because I too run a bookstore, or because I daydream of being a burglar, or pulling the heist in Ocean's 11, or 12, etc...Must just be a guy thing, we all like to think about pulling it off...This was a nice installment, I dont know if I am finaly synced up with the writing, or if this one was more transparent than some, but I had it pretty well figured by the end, when Bernie did the big reveal.Usually I am doing well to be close, let alone had it mostly ciphered out, and he added a nice. ""Explain it all to Caroline"" at the end, so if anyone missed any nuanced subtleties, whey got to know what it was.This might be the last of these I have... May be time to hunt..."
4,back to the basics,"After the successful stylistic experiments of the last couple of Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, THE BURGLAR ON THE PROWL is a return to the earlier form of the series. It's a bit darker than the others -- some reviewers have complained that a fairly graphic rape scene stops the book cold, although I disagree -- but it's a typically solid Bernie yarn."
4,Essential underground hip-hop,"""Duck Season 1"" was one of the most ambitious and exciting rap compilation mixes of the last year, no doubt, and established Babu as one of the better DJs around. Instead of trying to outdo Volume 1, the new ""Duck Season"" is far more laid back and sophisticated in terms of song choice, mood, and overall vibe. If Volume 1 was for the ride and a bunch of brothers cruising around on a Saturday night, Volume 2 is its mellow cousin, not exactly hitting you in the face but keeping the flow. I'd say both of them are two of the best mix CDs since the ""Superrappin'"" compilations. A must."
3,"Great film, disappointing presentation on Blu-ray","I loved this film when I first saw it on DVD, particularly because of the excellent music. I was initially disappointed by the stereo only soundtrack of the DVD, so when I heard of a Blu-ray release with DTS-MA audio, I was really looking forward to a high quality, full surround presentation. I received the Blu-ray, put it in the PS3, AND..... was again disappointed by 2 channel audio! The back of the disc is marked ""Dolby Digital 5.1"", ""DTS Surround"", and ""DTS-HD Master Audio"", but don't believe it. There are 3 audio tracks on the disc, 2 of which are director/cast commentaries, and all 3 audio tracks are DTS-MA 2 channel audio. Also, as indicated by the other reviews, I was unable to access any of the featurettes. On the plus side, the video quality is a big improvement over DVD."
1,I *hated* this movie,"I thought this movie was a complete disaster. It all starts with my reaction to the songs. To be blunt, they *sucked* big time. It was impossible to believe that these people were creating any sort of ""magic"" when my ears told me otherwise, and the whole thing lacked credibility. When you see characters in front of the screen reacting as if they are there at the moment of creation of some great music, and you hear something that is worse than forgettable, it just fails miserably. As this movie did. So the bottom line...listen to the music first. If it works for you, then perhaps you will like the otherwise trite and not terribly believable fairy tale of a story. And if it doesn't, save your time and money and watch Disney's ""Snow White"" instead--it's a lot more credible and enjoyable."
1,Dog of a movie in need of a leash.,"I don't get it. How on earth could anyone give this stale slice of mediocrity a favorable review?The acting was so banal it made the second-rate, cheese-ball story line seem Shakespearean. And let me go on record and say the screenplay came across as having been cobbled from every sappy `boy meets girl' endeavor to flop on the wide screen.The music was touted as being so powerful its contribution to the movie may well make it the ""best musical film of our generation"". Puleeze!! I noticed a poster of Leonard Cohen's 1973 'Live Songs' on one of the walls in the boy's bedroom . Do yourself a favor and buy the Leonard Cohen album. It's a thing of beauty and will sustain your soul for the rest of your life. Avoid this trite affair at all costs. No should have to suffer thru Once ... not even once."
1,Trite Mediocre Garbage,"Boring, slow moving with no screen chemistry, poor acting, and miserable meaningless ""music"". The storyline was poor and unimaginative. Are so we so used to mediocrity in this culture, we actually believe drivel like this has value? I am afraid so."
1,Cliched,"This movie is slow paced, cliched, filled with bad music and has an unsatisfying ending...How Roger Ebert could give this a good review is beyond me."
