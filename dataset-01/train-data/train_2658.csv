4,KitchenAid Mixer,"I love KitchenAid products!This is only my 2nd kitchenAid Mixer, the first KitchenAid I purchased was in 1990(Ultra Power in Cobalt Blue)that one lasted for 18 years with regular use. I just hope this one can go the distance.ACB-FORT WASHINGTON, MD"
5,"Excellent product, worth the purchase price","I purchased this about a year ago on sale. (The white was on sale for $199 and I couldn't pass it up even though I worried I wouldn't use it much). Turns out it's been a huge help in the kitchen. Especially great for yeast breads, as I can mix the bread and let it rise in the bowl. Really low clean up. The bread hook that is included kneads bread well. Also great for cookies and other baked goods.The mixer is heavy and stays well put on the counter, it does not take up as much counter space as I had thought. It came with a cook book which doesn't get used much, but just about any baked good recipe can be made with this mixer once you've got the routine down. I purchased an additional recipe book, but really did not use as I mainly recipezaar recipes these days.Well worth it, you won't regret the purchase, but you may want to watch prices for a little while and time your purchase."
5,Love it!,I bought this to replace my older basic Kitchenaid mixer. The color is beautiful! This mixer is so easy to use & easy to clean.
5,KitchenAid KSM150PSGC Artisan Series Tilt-Head 5-Quart Stand Mixer. Gloss Cinnamon,I been cooking for several years. I had several different mixers. But nothing like the KitchenAid. The narrow beaters cut right through the dough and batters. So many of the other beaters the batter or dough collect on them and ball up at the top of them. You have to stop clean them then go on finish the job. This mixer has the SPEES AND POWER LIKE NO OTHER.I remodel my kitchen i wanted a burgundy color.I got the Gloss Cinnamon IT LOOK GREAT I LOVE THE COLOR. I like mine so much i purchasted one for my Daughter for a christmas gift.
5,Awesome KitchenAid buy,"Great product, arrived in just a few days, securely packaged in original packing. Everything inside was in pristine condition. Used the mixer almost immediately and it performed just like I hoped it would. So easy to use and a good owner's manual included. The splash shield is very handy and the side handle on the bowl is a big help. Due to the weight, it sits out on my counter top but the red color makes it almost like a decorative item also. I recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a new mixer. The price couldn't be beat, and believe me, I looked!"
5,At Long Last!,"I have wanted a Kitchenaid stand mixer for years. This Christmas I finally got one as a gift from my wonderful husband. And the mixer is everything I thought it would be and more. I made bread following a recipe that came with the instruction booklet and--oh my gosh--so very easy. The hook attachment is fabulous and I did not have to hand knead the dough at all. And the bread was excellent. Love, love, love my Kitchenaid. Also, it sits on my kitchen counter looking like a work of art!"
4,Very good mixer,I am really happy with my mixer and have always been impressed with the KitchenAid brand. The only thing I don't really care for is that the batter/ingredients get on the side of the bowl and you have to stick a scraper in while it is mixing or shut it off and scrape the sides frequently. But overall I really feel I can rely on the mixer for a LONG time and I really like the large selection of color choices!
2,Works Well....Now....Looking Like Hell,"Bought this device in Green, years ago.NOW the paint is peeling off and the bare metal looks like Hell."
2,3 minutes and dead!,"Got the Artisan from another retailer for Christmas. Ran for 3 minutes on a quick bread recipe, turned it off to get an egg, and it will not turn back on! KA customer service is good - sending a new mixer, but now I'm skeptical of the quality!"
3,"Good for easy mixing, not good for bread dough","I am somewhat disappointed in this mixer. The only reason I bought it is to make large quantities of bread, which I sell out of my home. I have been using a hand mixer with 2 spiral dough hooks and it works great, it mixes and kneads my dough as long as I need it to but it takes a toll on the mixer after a while and me since I have to stand there so long to get it kneaded well. I thought this tough kitchenaid could take it but it gets really hot and the dough climbs up the dough hook and makes an aweful mess! I read online that the solution for this is to get a spiral shaped dough hook instead of the C-hook that comes with it, but I can't find a spiral shaped hook that is compatible with my model. If I only needed it to make cake batter I'm sure it would be well worth the money, but the only reason I got it is for bread and it's not doing a good job for that, so hence the lower rating."
4,Technically it's not mine but I love it!,"My sister got this for my mom as a Christmas present. Little does she know that my mom really doesn't like to cook much (I seem to be the gourmet in the family). I've wanted one of these for a while and my mother says it's basically mine. All I know is, it's definitely coming with me when I finally move out! I have used it twice so far and I think it's a great machine. The only gripe I have with it is that the splash shield really doesn't work very well for liquid mixtures. I used it to make pudding and every time I put the milk in it got sprayed everywhere. One way they could remedy that is to make a shield that has a slide-out cover for the pouring implement. Other than that I've found it's lived up to my expectations and I can't wait to purchase the pasta attachment kit. It's been so long since my family has had homemade pasta (we're Italian on my mom's side). I'll be happy to finally be able to taste Gramma's ""homemades"" again!"
5,Kitchenaid Mixer,I am really enjoying my new Kitchenaid mixer. I have been very pleased with the product and was very pleased with the price...especially since shipping was free! Thanks!
4,Works great but could use more recipes and tips,"I love my new KitchenAid Stand Mixer. So far it works great. it was perfectly adjusted for clearance when it arrived, and everything works well. I wish more recipes and tips of how to adapt recipes had been included with the machine. For a couple of days I just wasn't quite sure what to do with it or how to use recipes I already have with it. I have found some tips on-line but would like more. It is a beautiful machine. I was not prepared for how much movement it makes in kneading bread, but I assume that is normal. I also was given the ice cream attachment, which I will add comments on once I have a chance to try it."
5,All That and MORE,"I first owned the 6 qt mixer, but it was more than I needed. I then bought the 5 1/2 qt model and its perfect. Its large enough to handle my largest mixing needs for baking. Soon I will attempt to make dough from scratch, something I have never done before. I have no dout of this being successful, I'm looking forward to it. I'm what you might call a Sunday afternoon baker, but with the tools included, I feel theres not too much that I can't do. I am so glad I purchased this item. A great product and at a more than fair price."
4,Mixer Madness!!!!,I've been wanting one for a very long time and I'm quite glad I waited and got this outstanding mixer! I also was able to get a great color!!!!!!
4,Great lights,"These are great solar lights. They are larger than most, have a bright white light and even on the cloudiest days they are lit at night. They are a good great of stainless and really shine. The only problem is that they only come with a deck mount. We really wanted them for the yard so we inserted a 2x2 stake and put the light over then. They sit nice and did not even move in a strong wind. I bought the first two sets from Overstock for much more."

3,"underwater housing, dome port","everything received in good condition and timely.The dome port seems to be easily scratched. It was delivery with a protection hood, which is appreciated."
2,you get what you pay for,"This vacuum is very loud, while the suction is not good either. With such bad suction, you have to vacuum the same areas 2-3 times in order for it to pick up the dirt and dust..."
1,Not Happy,"I don't have this exact model but one just like it. It doesn't have a lot of power. It can't pick up things like a little piece of napkin off the floor. Also for it to pick up crumbs, I have to go back and forth over it many times. My best friend bought one also and says the same thing. I've had to take it apart to clean it many times. Hair gets caught and every so often it has a burning smell. I'm unhappy and so is my friend and we haven't owned them long. We are looking to buy new vacuums."
3,read your manual,"in response to the last review, I have a featherlite bagless and it works fine. It has a two year warranty on parts and the motor, so if it burned out after 9 months, you could have very easily gotten it replaced for very little money. And if you read the manual people, it gives very detailed instructions on how to solve any problem you might have."

3,Shame about the DVD standard,"This is a great fun season with some fun new characters (especially George Kennedy- a great actor and Cathy Podewell) and some great plot twists, but, oh dear, a TRULY TERRIBLE DVD TRANSFER--the wort of all the previous seasons. Why????????????????? Even when showing it on my blu ray, it still looks blurred, fuzzy, almost like a copy of a copy of a copy. Are Warners now just rushing these out to the conclusion with no concern of quality at all? It also arrived in terrible shape (Amazon bad packaging) Again a shame as it has one of the best episodes of the latter part of the series (""The Sting"", more plot twists and surprise returns than any of any episode)With only three box sets to go (season 13 and 14 and the telemovie set)can't Warners at least look at the poor and shoddy prints they are selling to the public??"
1,Trash,"The producers have obviously tried very hard to make one last season,but have totally failed to do so. The video quality is much below standard and the season ends with a number of unsolved issues. There is no happy and no sad end, there is just no end.After enjoying the first 11 seasons, number 12 was a total flop and a waste of money."
1,season 10 in season 12 box,I AM SOO BUMMED BEEN WATCHING ALL THE SEASONS UP TO SEASON 12 it gets here and the seller put season 10 in season 12 box ..so sucks now I have 2 season 10's and the seller just wants to refund my money after I send back HIS MISTAKE !! Told him please just send me the right season no responce back ...
5,Great Season - one of my favourites!,"This season is one of the better ones, JR is getting a few good ones here (he certainly did not expect his hunting trip to turn out this way)! There are a number of great scenes, two of my favourites are when his new wife enters the dining room at Southfork to everyones surprise (but not to JRs pleasure) and this wonderful scene when Bobby and JR get stuck in the office elevator and are forced to spend the night there (Bobby having a box of the finest French Red Wines and not wanting to share with JR - just enjoy what happens)! Carter McCay is a worthy opponent in this season, the way he makes it to the top even JR has to admire. Sue Ellens ambitions in the movie industry and Cilff Barnes new job round up the whole thing. All in all most certainly a good buy!!"
3,"So-so Season, So-so Video","Certainly not the best season storywise, but it wasn't the worst either. Hadn't watched this season since it first aired, so it had some intrigue for me. Some stories are laughable (like Haleyville), and Sue Ellen's storyline is a complete waste. She should have gone to jail (and left the show) in the Season Premiere for shooting J.R. in the Season 11 Finale. Instead, we're subjected to boring, predictable scenes with her and Don Lockwood throughout the season as they work on her movie (which was just an excuse to take viewers down memory lane during the show's glory days). At least there are still several fan-favorite characters left this season, and a few familiar faces return to Dallas this year (Lucy, Ray, Afton). By Season 14 (maybe Season 13?), I recall there were few original or long-time characters left in the cast. The video quality could definitely stand to be cleaned up."
5,Dallas part 12,Dallas was one of the best shows on TV. We have all 12 seasons now. Can't wait until April till season 13 come's out. Really nice to re-live this show from the 80's. We just love it.
4,"Wonderful season but sucky season finale,","I hate how it ends, but the season was great, very short season compared to all the other seasons."
3,"Dallas 12th Season played good, but snowy picture.","I bought this new DVD from Amazon. I figured it would have a crisp clear picture, but it doesn't. It did play well, without skipping or stalling. That was a plus, because I have bought new Dallas DVDs in the past that have not played well and had to send them back. It's a shame the quality is not good because I love Dallas and have almost all the DVDs in the collection series and they don't come cheap. I guess it's the video company. Amazon has been good about my returns, and I appreciate that.Dallas: The Complete Twelfth Season"
3,"lets get honest old actors, bad transfers and lousy season","man lets get honest here, the story line for this season was boring, the actors look like they need to have an oxygen tank next them for every scene, even Lucy has bags under eyes and not even as beautiful as the early years and after watching and old dvd of the fourth season, this season transfers were horrible pixeled and double lined and looked awful enough for the viewers watching with me noticed it too. Also the stupidest cliff hanger is whether JR.movie on his life that Sue Ellen made will hang on his head how unexciting.its a shame to cash in on a good show with fast lousy compressed discs all 26 episodes on three discs how cheap.I am going back to Dynasty and channel 34 novelas which have HD and improved production values.Ps I still will buy season thirteen regardless of the quality and maybe this stilly storyline from season 12 will get better."
1,Very disappointed.,"When I ordered this video, I based my decision on the ratings it had received. I was very excited when I finally received it and sat down as soon as I got home to watch it. I watched the entire video and at the end was very disappointed with the content. I was so hoping to get some new insight on potty training my son. But this video showed me absolutely nothing I didn't already know and hadn't already tried. I'm sure this video would be great for those parents who don't have the first ounce of common sense."
4,HELPFUL IN LEARNING THE ARAMAIC LANGUAGE,I am so far very pleased with my purchase of this bible. It helps me to learn more about the aramaic language. I wake up each morning with an eagerness to learn more in God's WORD. I highly recommend it.
1,YUK!,This did nothing to ease a dry mouth caused by medications. This did not taste good and almost seemed somewhat salty.
3,A Good Beginning,"This small booklet, only about 20 pages, has short articles on some of the various rituals of mourning practiced in the 19th Century. I purchased it many years ago, perhaps from the author herself. It's a good beginning for one who wants to research Victorian mourning customs, but there is much more to be learned."
3,Standard tees,"These are great standard tees with a problem: why use black, dark blue or green for a golf tee? Impossible to find."
3,You get what you pay for,"Quantity not quality.They are painted, so they'll mark up your driver something awful.Bottom line, if you have expensive clubs... get expensive tees.If you have less expensive clubs (beginner clubs) then go for it... just get ready to constantly clean your driver head after snapping these tees."
3,Cheap Tees,"These tees are made from some sort of cheap wood. They break usually after one or two uses. They are inexpensive, but they are also cheaply made. I will buy them again, but only because they are cheap."
2,For diehard fans,"I've like everything Bose has done since Bandido over the years, well, not so much Sombrero. This live set is just ok with a very boring song selection that he's covered to death or should have forgotten. The only real gem is a new, almost better, arrangement of Sevilla. He seems to be playing to the teenybobbers and coasting a bit, which is disturbing after Velvetina. I think he's great and this is enjoyable but really for hardcore fans."
5,For the Poultry Surgeon . . .,"These Sabatier poultry shears have four great features (among others): (1) Made in France, by Sabatier, a 160-year-old house of cutlery design and manufacture; (2) Ergonomic--your hand doesn't get cramped from cutting up large amounts of poultry; (3) Hygienic--they go in the dishwasher, so any Salmonella or other bacteria are eliminated; and (4) Great Buy.My J.A. Henckels's chrome-plated poultry shears are beautiful but so hard to sanitize because they cannot go in the dishwasher. Use these Sabatier poultry shears, along with a good quality boning knife, and you will never want to buy those expensive packages of cut-up chicken again."
2,A bit disappointing,"CEC is an important new analytical method for chromatographers, so I was disappointed by the authors' superficial treatment."
4,A little boys dream,"I bought this for my 4 year old nephew last year for Christmas. After the frustrating process of getting it together, the darn thing kept falling apart. He did not care though. He has as much fun playing with it in parts as when it is together. When they moved this summer his dad tried to get him to throw it away, but it made the trip across country with him anyway. A year later he still plays with it, so I have to say it is a pretty good investment."
1,Bad battery,"I purchased the Ultralast UL-NH10 battery for a digital camera. It would not hold a charge! My first test was a trip to Mexico. I had gone through the routine of a full discharge and then full charge numerous times for the battery ""memory."" I got to Mexico, took two pictures and the battery was dead. My old battery I was replacing did better!"
5,Hey that's my name too!,"I really liked this book. I picked it up because I like historical romances. It was great when I found out that the heroin's name was the same as mine. Definatly a plus! The plot was very interesting. Gwendolyn is a woman branded a witch. In the start she is tied to a stack and ready to be burned. I like the element of magic through out the whole book. I would really recommend this book to anyone interested in history, magic, and love!"
5,Excellent!,"Gwendolyn is sentenced to die at the stake as a witch in 13th century Scotland, but that's just where the story starts. Condemned by false accusations and spurned by her clan, Gwendolyn is rescued from the pyre by Mad MacDunn, a laird at the end of his rope and in search of a witch, his last chance to cure his dying son.The character studies in this book are outstanding. I cried at the injustice of Gwendolyn's treatment and I cheered when the MacDunn's defended her. I hated to put this book down and would easily have read it in one sitting if I had the opportunity. It was captivating and interesting. The strength of this book is in the strength of Gwendolyn's character and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical romance. I got two of Ms. Monk's books at the same time and am now impatient to get into the next story. Ms. Monk is now on my shelf of favorite authors."
4,A good Book!!,I LIKED THIS BOOK. The only thing I didn't like was the character Isabella. She was rather annoying to me. Gwendolyn was a good character who finds out she really does have powers. Because she had different ways people ostracized her. I thought the other characters were a hoot especially Lachlan. All I can say is I enjoyed this book. The banter between the characters made it fun to read.
3,a good story,"This is the second book I've read of Karyn Monk's and I must say I liked it much better than the first one I read ""once A Warrior"". I liked the fact that the heroine in thei book Gwendolyn may be very fragil looking but she is strong in spirit and puts others beforeherself even though the other may not be deserving of it. Alex the hero is a tortured soul after his first wife's death and I liked the way Karyn Monk showed that he had true feelings of loss and really truely mourned his wife even though it was common practice to get remarried asap if children were involved. I didn't like the relationship that Alex had with his sick son and even though it gets better during the story it could have been so much more.I enjoyed this book and will probably get other books by Karyn Monk."
4,Very interesting indeed,"Saer begins the book with a coiled narrative with intensive mood, a story that took place in a freezing winter in Paris and then suddenly changes to another environment, a lazy conversation between friends in a hot summer in Argentina. That happens throughout the book, like a warn-up then cool down joke.The most interesting thing here is a story that one of the characters narrates to the others.At the final revelation, you'll be able to know the reviews of the story through the eyes of these ""independent"" personages.A very interesting book by a great writer."
1,Clogs Galore,"I've spent more time clearing out clogs then vacuuming with this piece of junk. The clogs aren't easily cleared either, you have to have an engineering degree to dismantle the entire thing before clearing it out. Suction isn't there either. You get what you pay for, I guess. I just purchased the Eureka Boss Smart Vac 4870 which is rated CR Best Buy - I'm sure I'll be more successful with it then this loser of a vacuum!"
3,Good but not great.,"I purchased the Dirt Devil Platinum Force because I read somewhere that it was the most reliable of cleaner of this type. ( I've owned a long line of Bissell spot cleaners and Proheats that worked great, then died as soon as their short waranties expired).After my first use, here is how it compares to Bissell Proheat:- While still heavy, running the DD seemed to stress my arms and back less.- I miss the Bissell's water heater.- I miss the small attachment tool being ready to use at any moment. (You have to attach/detach this one for each use).- The DD seemed to leave the carpet more damp.Overall, DD did well, but the Bissell just cleaned better. And the DD is less handy. So, if you have no expectations for a cleaner lasting longer than 1-3 years, buy the Bissell. Why can't somebody make a great carpet machine that lasts? I wish everyone could ship all their broken junk machines to the Bissell CEO's home."
2,Disappointed!,"After being offered this item in my Gold Box, and reading its rave reviews, I was really looking forward to getting it and seeing how it worked on my fairly new (but stained) family room carpet. What a letdown! It was complicated to put together, heavy, and didn't even begin to remove dirt or stains from my carpet. If I still had the box, I'd send it back (my good ol' Hoover Steam-Vac works much better)."
3,Get the Hoover steamvac 5914 instead,"I had this for several years until the water tank cracked and I decided mayber it was time to just get a new carpet shampooer. I thought the Dirt Devil did a decent enough job for the price, until I decided to try the Hoover Steamvac 5914 (which costs about the same when on sale) to see how it worked, and let me tell you - there is no comparison. The Hoover Steamvac 5914, works much better - lifting and cleaning matted down carpet that the dirt devil couldn't touch. I had been using the dirt devil carpet extractor regularly for the past 5 years, but my carpets were still looking old and worn - the dirt devil just doesn't do a very good job of getting into the fibers, or of sucking all the water out afterwards. After using the Hoover only 2 times, my 10 year old carpets look almost like new again. So my advice is, pass on the dirt devil and get the hoover - you won't regret it."
5,The best I've ever used,"I clean houses for a living, so you can imagine the abuse my equiptment takes. When I first looked at this steamer, the price almost scared me off, but after some more research, I decided to go for it. What an amazing machine!! This is the third steam cleaner I have purchaced,and I am extremely impressed by its performance! With its two bruches and dual suction, not much dirt stands a chance. I've even gotten old stains up, many that I had treated before. It's about time that somebody (Thank you Dirt Devil) put out a home machine that can handle everyday kid, pet etc dirt."
2,hard to push,Hoovers are easier to push. My old one was a Hoover and I loved it. This one only lasted a couple years if that. I am just doing my review and I have already had to replace it.
1,Piece of junk!,"I had this product for little over a year. I took it out today to clean my carpet after winter and after I put the water tank onto the unit, the cheap plastic that the water tank is made of broke and water went everywhere! I couldn't believe this happened and wound up going to Home Depot to rent a cleaner (which worked very well) and threw this unit in the dumpster. I will never buy another Dirt Devil product again - they really lost their quality since they are mass producing everything in China now. My friend has a Bissel steam cleaner and she loves it, I think I am going to get one of those next time or just rent one again."
1,ka- put after 3 uses,"Wow !! rinse pump died on the third use after 14 months. We'll see about warranty, two years, good thing, BUT Royal says to ship complete unit back, prepaid!! UGH!!"
4,Pet owners rejoice!,"Stop wasting your hard earned money on those store rental machines while having to lug them back & forth,the dirt devil cleaned my carpet just about as good! I'd say the ""Rug Doctor"" has a 5% edge in cleaning power, but the convenience, affordability, and ease of use of the Dirt Devil makeup the differance!A ""Dirt Devil Plus"" was the shampoo dispenser, I found it saved time and over use of shampoo, also smelled and worked great as well! (A free sample came with the product!)The only negative I found with the Dirt Devil Platinum Force was maneuvering, the wheels were a little difficult."
1,Good while it lasts,"We purchased this machine 4 years ago. We used it twice (for a total of 12 hours, at the most) and were pleased with the performance. However, the motor died 2 hours into the third use. We called Dirt Devil, but they would not compromise on the 2 year warranty."
1,Terrible service,"Unfortunately I never got a chance to use this product because I was sent an opened box with the contents falling out. It was obviously shipped this way, and the tape job was laughable. I sent it back, and won't reorder because someone who cares so little about their product doesn't deserve my business."
4,"Good Product, very simple to deal with","Bought the Dirt Devil and just like the reviews said, it was very easy to assemble. A few screws and your done. Easy to use, nice features, easy to clean afterwards. The suction is excellent.The only negative thing I have to say is that its pretty heavy and hard to push. Not impossible, but its heavy.Overall for the ease to operated, and put together, its well worth it. You will NOT be dissapointed."
2,"Owned for 4 months, doesn't work already`","Heavy, cleaned ok, (no better than others I've tried), hand tools didn't work well the ONE time I used it, now sprayer doesn't work at all. I purchased it mainly for my upholstery. Overall, I regret buying this product."
4,Dirt Devil CE7900,"The product was very easy to assemble. I have two dogs so I plan on using the Dirt Devil frequently. The units is easy to fill w/ water and easy to empty. I like the reservoir that mixes to detergent with the water so you don't have to. I have been pleased with how clean the carpet gets and also the amount of water extracted. The unit is also very east to clean after using. I have used the unit about 5 times so far and the only downside I see the the weight. It is relatively heavy so if that is an issue for you, it may be a problem. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
5,One good cleaner!,"I have two cats, and I do vacuum on a very regular basis to keep up with the pet hair, but to my surprise, this thing kicked up nearly an entire cat's worth of fur! On top of that, the water was FILTHY when I finished cleaning. I cleaned my carpets with my sister's Hoover only about 6 months ago, so it was a little surprising how dirty they were. I had no real tough stains, but the Dirt Devil easily took care of the stains I did have. The unit was easy to put together (done in minutes!). Yes, it's heavy when it's loaded, but well worth pushing around the load for the job it does. I did a lot of research, and the only thing I would change if I had it to do over again would be to have purchased the Dirt Devil sooner. I am very happy with this machine."
5,This is a great carpet cleaner!,"Over the years, I have owned several carpet cleaners in addition to using professional cleaning services.This cleaner was the best. It left my carpets the cleanest and the machine is easy to use. Other machines were bulky and messy; this machine is relatively light and doesn't leave a mess.I bought the Dirt Devil Extractor after workers had gotten sawdust over everything and when I finished cleaning, the carpets looked like new.My mom was trying to clean her carpets with spray carpet cleaners and they were only looking worse. One time through with the Dirt Devil Extractor and she was amazed at the difference."
4,one year later and still going strong,"I am so pleased w/the performance of this product.I had found this 6 month old chocolate milk stains on my carpet and thought ok I'm screwed I'm not getting back my security deposit.I gave my new steam vac a try and it came right off w/ the help of the brush attachment.We were living in Guam last year and our apt. got soaked from the super typhoon.We used this steam vac to help suction out the wet carpets and worked like charm,then we went back and shampooed it over,over and over again.well,it's one year later and still going strong.It's easy to use,clean and manuever.I highly recommend this product and I hope it works as well for you as does for me."
4,Great carpet cleaner,"Received this item in record time. Ordered on Saturday, and received it on Tuesday. Wow!! Item is easy to use and does a great job. Recommend it to all!!"
2,"hate to be a party-pooper, but....","I was so excited to get my dirt devil delivered so that I could use it to clean my area rug under my dining room table. The main reason I ordered it was because of the mutitudinous positive reviews from other amazon customers. Well, I assembled it easily enough and got going on the carpet....it was such a let-down. It was not very effective, I had to go over and over the same spots which were light/not major stains. In the end I unassembled it, put it all back in its box and had it returned. I must say, amazon was great about the return...picked it up at my door and gave a full refund quickly."
1,impossible to clean front suction area,"I've had mine for about 4 years - We have shorthaired dogs and I vaccuum before carpet cleaning. Immediately I discovered that there is no way to open up the front suction area to clean the unit (even thought there are screws). Now the water tank leaks through the rubber connector. The last time I used it, the water leaked out of the tank quickly as soon as I put the handle down to push the unit. It is also hard to totally clean out the dirty water tank. Clearly I have a dog hair problem - however I wouldn't have a complaint if I could open the unit up and clean out the hair. The suction was always good and I was happy the way it cleaned, however I wish I had bought a brand that heated the water for even better cleaning."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this extractor a while back. I don't clean my carpets a lot, so it didn't get a lot of use. The fifth time I went to use it, the motor burned out. Of course, it was just out of warranty. So, I only got 4 uses out of it. It would have been cheaper to have my carpets cleaned. I tried to get it repaired, but it cost as much as I paid for it. I contacted Dirt Devil (Royal) to see if I could just buy the motor and install it myself, but they won't do that. Only authorized dealers can work on them. What a scam!"
4,Great Cleaner for the Price,"I purchased the Dirt Devil CE7900 last week here at Amazon. I am very happy with the job this unit does. For what I would have spent to rent equipment or have a service come in once, I own a machine that does just as good a job. It is very easy to assemble and simple to use. I will admit the unit is fairly heavy so be ready for a workout if you plan on doing an entire house. I have read other reviews complaining about the dirty water that drips out of the front when emptying the dirty water reservoir. I Just carry a little towel or rag to place under the front while I dump the dirty water. I had a one or two stubborn spots/stains that I ended up treating with a different product but the dirt devil worked wonders on heavy traffic soiled areas and the spots where the dog lays. I have not owned other carpet cleaners but I can say this one is a great bargain at [this price]."
4,"Great product, still working after 4 years of heavy use","This is one of the best purchases I ever made. The dual brushes and dual suction really clean a dirty carpet. I have used this shampooer at least once a month for 4 years and it is still going strong. I recently lent it to my brother who's dogs had soiled his carpets for years and after a couple cleanings his carpets look like new and the smell is gone. The only negatives I would have are that the handle is in two parts and feels a bit wonky so you don't want to put too much sideways torque on it. I should also mention that the suction and weight of the unit makes it hard to push and pull, so small or weak persons might have trouble operating it. Because I, my wife, and my dog have long hair, I have to take the roller brushes all the way off and thoroughly clean them after every use or they get bound up, the belt melts and then breaks. Replacement belts can be purchased on Amazon. They are Dirt Devel size 4/5 belts."
1,Misleading Advertsising for this product,This vacuum CLAIMS to be steam vac--but is NOT. The water you add does not heat up--it's only as hot as your tap =costs as much as really good ones that really heat the water in the unit.Don't buy this if you want a steam vac.
4,Worth the money,"Used this on carpet badly in need of cleaning. Did a very good job. Not like new, but it got the spots out. Easy to assemble, easy to use and I like the clean water rinse. It does leak a little when standing still, but just vacuum over the wet spot and it's fine. Got an amazing amount of cat hair from the carpet even after vacuuming with a Dyson. Heavy, but feels solidly built."
2,Classic and solid book but a lot of typo error,"This book contain all generalized concept of random processes which is very classic and good book but we are all know that first version of this book have many typing error. Due to difficulty of this book, any printing mistake can make you stuck for a really long time (for real). In the hope of some improvement that second edition will fix any mistake occur in first book. In reality, it is a big surprise to me that there is a LOT of typo error. In addition, I realized after borrow first edition from my professor that THIS SECOND edition have MORE typing mistake than first one...In my opinion, for any people who really need to read this book for their research or interest, try to find old first edition.Buy this one if and only if you cannot find first edition..."
5,Pretty color,I have been wanting this print for years and was very surprised to see it on your site. I was very excited when I finally received it.
3,Where the frock is Season 1 & Untucked!?,"RuPaul's Drag Race continues to wow me season after season. Their was no hesitation when it came to buying Season 2 on dvd. I am glad to see that it is uncensored...BUT WHERE IS SEASON 1? Season 1 was what started it all with some of my favorites, Nina Flowers & Ongina!!! AND WHERE IS UNTUCKED!? Untucked is a HUUUUUGEEEEE part of the show...this season cannot be complete without seeing Mystique yell ""BITCH I AM FROM CHICAGO!""Also i know LOGO explained why the first season would not be released, saying the music could not be cleared and instead of Untucked...that their would be lots of bonus features...yet there was only a few. The bonus features include meet the contestants, a closer look at the outfits from the ""gone with the window"" episode, Grand finale acting scenes & Reunion fan questions answered.Overall i am happy with the Season 2 Release, but i can only rate this 3 out of 5 stars. I hope to see Season 1 & both seasons of Untucked released soon!!!"
4,This is Just NOT RIght!!!!!!!!,"Where is Season One??? Season Two and Three before Season One is just messed up! Nina Flowers & Raven were two of the BEST of RuPaul Drag Race....... Season One ......... Duh!!!!!! Without Season One, it's a waste to buy Two and Three and I won't buy either!!"
1,What a rip off!,"I have to say, I got SO super excited reading these shows are coming out on DVD and not just iTunes but when I read the DVDs do not include The Untuck Episodes, I became very disappointed, I mean the untuck epidoses are part of the main show so why not include them on these releases? It makes no sense whatsoever to give the fans only half of the entertainment of what RDR has become to SO many fans worldwide. I will not even go into the drama behind the Season 1 DVD release. It makes me even more upset, I mean who uses other people's songs and not get clearance first? Not cool at all to deprive the fans from owning these tremendously funny and riot episodes. And yes, I know there is always iTunes but not everyone is into downloading stuff, some of us still prefer actual DVDs/CDs. Needless to say, I will not be buying these DVDs as I feel they are incomplete! I can only hope there is a second edition somewhere down the road with eveything included for each season, :-)"
1,"Sickening, and not in the good way...","No Season 1 due to ""music not being cleared"", no Untucked, no Drag U, no Bluray option...?Thanks but No Thnx, get back to your loyal fans who are just DYING (!!!) to buy this long overdue product when this herrific, drag-injustice is cleared up.. This is not Mildred Fierce LOGO TV!!"
2,Crying Fowl....,"""Country Queens"" is one of the most disappointing episodes of season 2. The queens have to star in a campy fish and chicken commercial directed by Kathy Najimy and go country. They rely on the old hillbilly stereotypes, without the comedy. The humor is expected. RuPaul, who's usually creative, gives a drab, unfunny script. Nobody even tried impersonating Reba McEntire, Taylor Swift, or Dolly Parton. Definitely a downer."
3,"A Fun Show, Too Heavily Edited","I like all the seasons of RPDR, though I was less happy with the outcome of Season 2 more than the others. There are fan favorites Pandora Boxx, Raven, and Jujube, which makes us wonder how Tyra won - her low profile, her somnambulance, and her tangible sparklessness are all rather obvious to see. The trouble with this show is how choppy it seems. Though it's gotten better of late, I always feel that we're not seeing a lot - a lot! - of what's really going on, what it takes to be a drag queen, the work involved, and the emotional toll of working in a field that doesn't get much respect. The challenges themselves are always heavily edited (Snatch Game in particular), so the results may not make a lot of sense to viewers. OTT and loving it."
5,"Eccentric, modern and eye catching","This show truly was like Pandora's box for me, thinking it was just another reality t.v. contest. It was so much more, the contestants on Rupaul's dragrace not only stunned me with their fierceness, but truly inspired me to go get out in the world and be who I am. Entertaining, jaw dropping and at times suspenseful, this show had it all."
3,Kill and kill again,Saw this a kid and although the acting is cheesy the fight scenes are pretty cool its one of my favorite martial arts movies of all time if you like cheesy acting and martial arts movies this is for you..although its a classic the price for this is extremely rediculous...
3,He's not one of the best but he isn't the worst either,"Kill and Kill again is all that I remembered: fair acting and mediocre martial arts. James Ryan does a decent enough job but his lack of expertise is evident throughout. Fast cuts and trampoline flips can't disguise average skills at best just as the puffing of one's chest can't compensate for a lack of physical size. The characters are cliche and comical (The fly being the exception), and Marduk beard's laughable. For the most part the fighting is stiff and so obviously choreographed that all exchanges come across like the ""one step sparring drills"" of beginners. Regardless, Ryan plays it straight and if your expectations aren't high, the movie is mildly entertaining."
3,Money better spent elsewhere,Only a so-so manual. Have found errors in this book. Nice cover though. Money much better spent on Lee's manual. I reload many handgun calibers. I really don't think they have actually tested every load in this book.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the skimpy section on pistol reloading. Since I had several Speer bullet calibers, I sent it back to order a Speer Reloading book."
5,Reloading,Reloading is a Technical and precise skill and you need the best technical help. HORNADY RELOADING HANDBOOK is the best. Don't go wrong do it right.
5,Reloaders bible....,"I load Hornady projectiles almost exclusively so the Hornady reloading charts are tailored to my particular use. I usually refer to more than one set of reloading charts for comparison. I also refer to Speer and Lee books for reference but the Hornady manual is my benchmark for loads, velocities and trajectory.No matter what reloading manual you purchase, the first chapter will be devoted to that particular company's corporate rise. I just skip that part and utilize the tables."
2,.... Yeah...,"Okay, once again if you want to see some nudity, it is here - story line is as cheesy as it gets, so you can look at it from a humorous perspective"
1,Are words really equivalent to physical assault?,"One of the key points of this book is that words can be as harmful as physical assault, which is why the authors believe that the law should suppress both.But if the two are equivalent, if hateful words are equivalent to bullets, then logically one can respond to words with bullets. Is that the view the authors really believe in and wish to promote? I sure hope not. But then the entire premise of the book is undermined."
1,don't like this item,It is just a trash. Blame me. I should buy an expensive flute instead. It was broken in a week and it's not worth to return it.
1,Not Really There At all,"We picked this up and watched it last weekend. What a complete disappointment. We should have realized what it was going to be like when very near the beginning the actors talked about how Byron had swam the Hellispont, not showing it. The point is, of course, this is a movie. I should move. It should not be people talking about what had happend in the past.It went on like that for most of the whole movie nothing really happening on screen, but people talking about what had happened off screen (except for a few mildly [and I do mean mildly] eroitic sceens. Shelly dies off screen, Byron's one daughter dies off screen, the entire lake Geneva summer never happens in the movie.We ended up watching the movie to the bitter end, just because we couldn't believe that it could possibly continue as badly as it had started out.It could."
4,Byron,"Byron was a pitiful excuse for a human being. Thank God he chose to write poetry--leaving some redemptive spirit behind. Luckily his poetry is controlled enough to read, unlike his personal life. A good film if one wants to learn something about Byron without having to wade through tomes of researchers who either attempt to emmulate him or denigrate him."
2,All the right features (with bugs),I've owned the Homepod for over 1 year now. To get the features I wanted I needed the Release 2 Beta firmware. This has been Beta for 2 years now! (written 4/2005) The system will hang after it's been on for several hours if you do anything besides just let it play. I find this particularly true if a shuffle operation is attempted. The system has to be power cycled. That wouldn't be a really big deal if it weren't for the 37 second startup time! I've found the overall experience to be a bit frustrating.
2,"Too much trouble, no support","Buy this only if you are a ""hacker"" type and want to spend hours getting it to work. The PC software is very poor and the unit is slow and buggy. The remote has a very limited range. If the software was improved on the PC side and the bugs removed from this device, then it would be worth it.Also, MacSense has not yet honored their rebate on this and it has been well over 10 weeks. They have not responded to my email about it either. Very disappointed."
2,Would someone please tell me why the audio server won't start?,"Well, I upgraded the software, and the rom and everything else I could figure out how to do on Macsense's on page.I still can't get the audio server software to start!It's really frustrating, because I'm pretty good at this stuff usually.Emails to Macsense have gone unanswered.If someone wants to help me...I would be forever grateful!Steve[...]"
1,Cylinder not long enough,"The bowl is beautiful and looks functional. However, the cylinder in the middle is not long enough for the chicken. The chicken drooped over and didn't stand straight. Going back to our old stand-up roaster, even though it's not pretty."
2,Cracked after one use,"Fantastic tasting chicken...put white wine, chopped rosemary and lemon grass, salt & pepper in well and it was one of the most moist chickens ever with a nice brown crust. Only problem was that it cracked (I had oven at 425 which I now realize is hotter than they advise) after the one use and I had to throw it out. I love the theory and method of cooking but next time will buy one made of stainless steel or iron."
5,Just what I wanted!,"I had given away my Tumbleweed chicken roaster to a friend and got a different one for myself, but I didn't like. It finally broke and I was so glad to get the original type back. Even my fussy husband loves the way the chicken cooks. It's always tender and flavorful - the best way to roast a bird!"
5,Great chicken cooker!,"This cooker was amazing! I used it in my oven and the chicken was moist and perfectly cooked with a crispy skin. Have not used it on the grill, yet."
1,Very disappointed,"This product was ordered as a Christmas gift for my sister. When it arrived, the packing box was in pristine condition - not even a crunched corner - and well packed with bubble packs. Not so with the box containing the actual product. It looked like it had been hanging around in a warehouse somewhere for years; worn, crunched corners, a hole in the front of the box, a hole in the back of the box, edges worn down to bare cardboard. If this had been the last one on the shelf at a store, I wouldn't have purchased it. Fortunately, the product itself was fine. Regardless, I was very disappointed that a company would send something in this condition that's ordered in December and may very well be, and was, a Christmas gift."
5,A Fun Adventure in Chick Lit!,"A walloping, spicy summer read. Plays up city romping by still-single women. Taps into a vital dynamic of Sex and the City -- jobs and men will come and go, but your girlfriends will always be there. Hope to see more from this author."
1,Shallow and Annoying,"Generally I love this genre. A group of single friends trying to make it in New York City. This story, however, was predictable and shallow. The main character concentrated mainly on getting drunk. Repeatedely her buzz is descirbed in mind numbing detail. Even though she is in the midst of a divorce, she is more concerned about her new haircut than her financial and emotional challenges. Her friends are equally annoying and often portray insulting stereotypes. The African American, the gay guy, and the Jewish girl all seemed consumed by the search for sex and the perfect relationship. The dialogue between the group was corny and unbelievable. What makes the author think it's okay to keep repeating ""You go girl""? As is typical with this type of literature everything works out nearly perfect in the end for everyone involved. This book was juvenile and boring and a complete disappointment...Don't waste your time."
4,Great knives,"I left one star out for some minor rusting that may be my fault. I started being lazy and running them in the dishwasher. All in all, the best for the money."
2,happy only so much.....,"Received knives a week ago. They arrived sharp and in good shape and look/feel nice. Sharpern works so-so, put a bit sharper edge on an old dull knife. The set is definitely not worth the list price, so the savings are in the mind of the seller.NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE STORAGE BLOCK. It is a nice looking block, but the cuts were way to large to properly accomadate several of the knives and not properly spaced for this knife set. Several slots were almost big enough to store the chefs knife. Without some ""creative"" placement, the shorter knives would tilt. The solution was to ""wedge"" the shorter knives below the chef knife. I will probably take effort to refinish the block from my old set and use it to store the knives."
3,A better description is needed,"This set was not marked that it was made in China, I also thought France was it's origin. From what I saw though not a bad set for the price at least how they look, only time will tell how the steel stands up. I managed to get a perty good edge on hem after a little work."
1,read the reviews,"I am a sucker for a bargin. While in France I bought a Sabatier Knife and have been delighted. When this DEAL came up I almost bought the set. After reading the reviews and finding the product made in China it is true you get what you pay for. This fall I will again be in France and will buy some more Genuine Sabatier knives. Now I begin to wonder about the other DEAL. I was looking at cookware, but now??"
2,"Yes, you can find a deal","That old saying still holds true ""you get what you pay for"". You can find a bargain out there, do alittle research ahead of time, it won't be wasted believe me when it comes time to buying ""quality"" knives, cookware sets, flatware, dishes etc., as they will be more expensive, but last you a good many years."
1,Sabatier Precision Sey,"I was under the impression Sabatier was a French product. This set is made in China. Knives were dull upon arrival,they are tough to sharpen and do not hold an edge when sharp. They also started to rust after the first time in the dishwasher. I am very disappointed with these knives and will return them ASAP."
2,Not the Real McCoy,"I own them, use them and enjoy them...however I was not happy that the knife set they advertise as Sabatier (which is French cutlery) is made in China which is not the case with the other more expensive knives I received as a wedding gift. ...."
5,Perfect for the Home Chef,"I purchased this set because of the Sabatier name, and once again I was over-impressed by the quality it delivered. This set does it all from the hard jobs of carving a 25lb top sirloin roast into perfect steaks to cutting the delicate tomato without crushing it. The bread knife is stellar for those of us who like to make our own bread at home and the steak knives are great for large dinner groups, (six knives instead of the usual four with most sets in this price range). All the knives have an excellent ergonomic friendly design for people like me who put in long hours in our kitchen for the relaxing stress relief of creating fine cullinary works of art. I encourage all chefs, (especially novice chefs), to buy this set. I am positive you will be happily surprized at the quality you get for the price."
2,Caveat Emptor!,"Made in China versions of the venerable french cooking knives. Not completely useless, the toothy utility knives are great for steak, and I use the boning/filet knife from time to time, but this was not what I expected-- the deep discount led me to believe the set was of higher quality. The price is low, but you get what you pay for!"
3,Average Set,"This set is an average lifespan set, I have had it for two years now and it has started to show quite a bit of wear and beginning to show signs of rusting in small spots."
5,No better knives for the price,"The feel of these knives is of professional quality. They are very sharp after 6 months and still spotless and look new. $$$ is a little pricey, you can probably get these for about $$$$ or so in you Gold Box."
4,Great Set,I have been using these knifes for about 2 weeks and for the money this is one of the best purchases i've made in a long time. I carved a Turkey in no time and it was effortless... I highly recommend this product.
5,best set of knives ever bought,"The price that they were sold , i was a bit sceptic, but gave it a try annyway, and frankly, never bought a better set of knives.And i speak from experience, used to work as a butcher for many years."
2,Hate at first sight,"Take my words for I learned them the first time I looked at those handles. I think they are made of woods and with such poor craftmanship. Obviously, it was made from China. Blades are sharp but they didn't appeared to be fine tuned with any detail. Bottom line is, good metal but bad product. $80 for a brandname set should be a big reminder of ""you get what you paid for""."
4,good for the price,"... They are ultra sharp & perform great. However the fit & finish are a little questionable. Don't plan on running these in the dishwasher, the wood handle finish will dull quickly & the blades will show some signs of rust or flaws. If you can live with washing these by hand they are a great deal. ..."
1,Not what you think you are getting,"You might think you are getting a great European manufactured high quality knife set that would retail for ($) (Amazon's list price, You save ($)This is in fact a light weight Chinese manufactured set which is not the quality you would be expecting from a high quality French company. It also looks like it will not give you years of us and since the metal is suspect you may not be able to shapen it over the years. Do youself a favor and spend more money for the real thing.REMEMBER IF IT LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THEN IT USUALLY IS."
3,Read Up on Knife Care Before you Buy,"This is a nice quality set for the ""regular"" home cook. (...) Rule One before you spend good money on good knives--learn how to care for them. Good knives do NOT belong in a dishwasher. Read Amazon's care guidelines and then take the one star ratings here with a grain of salt. If you want to abuse your knives or simply don't care about taking proper care of them, buy a ""cheap"" set every few years here or at your local discount store."
4,Great set of Knives for the price!!!!,"I was in the market for a new knife set and I really was not in the mood to spend a lot of money. This was an Amazon deal of the day and I got for 80% off of retail. The knives are extremely sharp and they feel good in my hands. Not too heavy, not too light. I have been using them for 3 weeks now and they get used everyday and run through the dishwasher every night. They still look and feel great!Bottom line is that they are a great deal for the money."
2,This set are made in China.,"Amazon.con should provide more details, where the product made. I thought this set made in France but it was make in China."
2,White Mountain Hand Crank Ice Cream Churn,"This ice cream churn was expensive and difficult to transport to where I live overseas, in a country whose unreliable electricity makes it a good idea. It came without any instruction booklet or recipes whatsoever, and ground a fine black metallic powder all over the top of the icecream. I suggest you look for a more user-friendly alternative with instructions and no black gunk."
4,The Pictures Were the Best Part....,"It's a fast, fun read but I was a bit disappointed except for the photos; I thought they were the best part. I'm probably being too critical, but I think there is more interesting and detailed ""behind the scenes"" info in other books, such asFilmed In Supermarionation: A History Of The FutureandThe Complete Book of Classic Thunderbirds."
5,If your out there please release on region1!!!,"This film is so beautiful-i saw it in the U.K.I really wish they would release in U.S format so i could have it to keeeep!!It is very realistic real film that gets right under your skin and into the little boy's head.Life is stark and hard for him but when he flys or handles that bird ,it sets his soul free.Not much time left-he's soon going to grow up and have to work in the mine and be smothered by mundane grind like folks around him.Heartbreaking without an once of sentimentality so this film gets you.Somewhat upsetting.But so goddam beautiful."
2,Marbles not as described.,"The Item was not as described, had cheap plastic marbles instead of glass marbles. Glass marbles were indicated in the product description."
3,Chinese Checkers game board too small..,I have my original game board from the 60's. This one I ordered for my Grandson to have because he likes playing it.. The holes are TOO SMALL! The marbles keep falling out when you try and make a play because your fingers bump the marbles next to the one you are moving! Please make the board bigger and user friendly! I would pay a little more for it to have one like the original..My old board used regular sized marbles...These use pea size!
1,Terrible - Way too small,The pieces are way too small. Nearly impossible for adult hands to pick up and move. Holes in board are too shallow and pieces are too light. The slightest bump sends everything flying. The drawstring clamp just broke as well.
2,Cheap!!!,"The product is NOT as described: marbles are PLASTIC and small - about pea size!The description says GLASS marbles!Also Instruction Sheet not enclosed.Not holes in the tin, but shallow indentions and the marbles are easily dislodged!Three of the colors for the marbles do not match the board: black, white, and green! Only red, blue, and yellow match! Thus lacking the violet, purple and orange/pumpkin colors!Very cheaply made as regards the pea-size PLASTIC marbles and the indentions being shallow!No way, no how comes close to the Chinese Checkers that I had invisioned and used in my youth!"
3,OKAY,SURE NOT MADE LIKE IT WAS YEARS AGO...ACTUALLY MADE CHEAP. THIS WOULD PROBABLY WORK WELL FOR TRAVEL OTHER THAN ALL THE SMALL PIECES. JUST KEEP IN MIND IF YOU HAVE LITTLE ONES THE MARBLES LOOK LIKE GUMBALLS!SUGGEST REPLACING THEM WITH REGULAR MARBLES!A TRADITIONAL GIFT BUT NOT MADE LIKE IT USE TO BE.
4,Thumbs up for a 'quick release' bicycle basket.,"I have used this basket with the Explorer rack for about 6 months now. I commute daily without a basket but put on this MTX Basket 10 or more times a week to run shopping errands. It has worked out very well for me.The carrying handle is too weak to carry more then light loads by hand, but I tend not to use it that way. I regularly carrying 20 to 25 pounds in the basket on the bike with no stability problems. Two full grocery bags fit in it just fine. The basket is holding up well, it still looks almost new.If you are looking for a quick-release basket for light to medium loads, this basket is worth considering."
4,Nice for small errands,"This basket mounts on the Explorer bicycle rack so you will also need to purchase thisTopeak Explorer Bike Rack. I did install it on a ladies' beach cruiser and just like other reviews stated, the basket wobbles a little and mounts close to the seat. However, my wife wanted a rear basket to carry a cooler to the beach and this is perfect. It won't hold alot like other reviews stated, but it will easily fit one bag of groceries. It comes off and on easily with Topeak's MTX track system so it isn't mounted permanently on the rear rack like other rear baskets and you can leave it off if you don't need it. It could be a little bigger in length, but otherwise is what my wife wanted."
3,A Convienent Product with Some Quirks,"I've really enjoyed using this basket, but there are a few caveats. I'm 5'7"", and I would caution folks shorter than me that their seat will push up against the basket -- mine does. It doesn't bother me very much, but it might if my seat were just a little bit lower.The only other issue is that you really have to tug at the basket to remove it. Sometimes I ask someone else to hold onto the handle bars of my bike for me while I pull it off, which gives extra leverage. When I'm alone, it can take a minute.All in all though, I like the mounting system and the way this basket looks, and it has held everything I've put in it. If I'm piling stuff high up in it, I use a net to hold everything in place."
1,Cheap Plastic,"This basket was so cheaply made, the plastic holding it on the bike rack snapped. I was only carrying one or two books in it! Topeak needs to discontinue this item! I don't know if I want to purchase anything else from them, but I am stuck with their bike rack :("
3,Very functional,"This arrived in a box that had been crushed. I was able to repair the basket because the sides are not that strong. That could be a disadvantage for some. I use this to pick up heavier groceries (bottles and such). It holds these products quite well and keeps them on my bike, but the handle will not carry the weight to use it as a shopping cart.My real advantage comes from the MTX attachement system. The basket is also used on my nephews bike to carry his school things back and forth. The attachement system allows us to share the basket as we need it."
2,Too cumbersome,"I have had this basket only since April 22nd. On one of my rides, I lost the handle somehow. Now it's a pain to carry into stores with me and I am going to get something else that easier to deal with. I like the rack system but the basket is just too cumbersome!"
4,Basket is on Bike and working (sort of),Nice basket idea and it fits the rack. I did not realize how it hooked on the rack. I am glad i ordered it from the same brand. However it does have a problem with the style of bike we have. Its too close to the seat but its not the makers fault. The bike is setup different. Low seat on large frame. Be nice if there was a way to adjust where the basket hooks. It's 2 inches too close to the seat. Should be a way to show types of bikes basket good for.
3,Be Sure You Purchase the Special Rear Rack Needed for This Item,"This basket is a nice one. It seems relatively sturdy, although it did arrive with one side crushed down a bit. But I was able to bend it back into shape. To use the nice clip on feature, though, you need their special rear rack to clip into. I had ordered a different rear rack, thinking it would clip in universally to any rear rack. Not the case. So now I have to go through the hassle of returning the incompatible rear rack and finding the right one. All in all, though, I do think this will be a good system for biking to the grocery store and purchasing two bags of groceries. I also purchased two of the diamond cargo nets and they appear to work nicely with this basket for securing the grocery bags for the ride home."
1,Not worth any price,"I bought this item and the rear bike that it goes with 4 months ago, and it has completely fallen apart. The handle will bend, the rail it uses to lock into the rack will jam and break off, and the latch will fall off. Please save your money. As an engineer i can say this product was very poorly engineered."
1,"Doesn't fit my ""standard"" bike rack!!!","It should be made clear that this basket only fits topeak racks.Now, I have to find some way to attach this thing, and it certainly won't be ""quick-release"". Ugh."
3,Not what I had hoped,"I purchased this basket for its compatibility with my topeak explorer rack. Topeak generally has good products but this basket fell short. It is made of very thin wire mesh which dents and bends with the slightest stress. The handle is unpadded and very thin and bent the first time that I used it. It was easy enough to bend back in to shape, but the fact that it bends so easily makes it pretty much useless. The basket does transport stuff on your rack, but I wish I had just strapped a plastic crate on and saved myself $20. The quick/track idea was good, but not very well executed on this particular item."
3,Convenient size and mounting,"Easy slide on -slide off mounting, large enough for a bag of groceries, sturdy enough for a frozen 20 pound turkey. Don't even think about using the handle to carry groceries though, it can barely support the weight a sack lunch and sweatshirt. Can only be used with a Topeak rack. Suspension seat post or oversize saddle may interfere with fit."
4,nice basket,"I had a Topeak rack and a matching panier (travel bag). I needed something a little larger for trips to the beach...don't buy this basket without the matching Topeak rack or you are wasting your money. Also, you need about 8 inches of clearance between the bootom of the bike seat and the top of the rack...The basket needs to fit under the bike seat...In other words, you need to be six feet tall if you want to use this basket..."
5,Great size basket,"This product I use to tote mainly groceries. But the thing can be used for a whole bunch of different jobs. The locking mechanism is great, as I can detach and take into the store to shop. It also fits into my husbands seat mounted rack. So he can use it for his errands."
2,Little disappointing,Very flimsy and weak cheap metal. When i opened the box it came in the basket was already bent and i do not think it was the delivery because I get packages all the time and they and never damaged. Not worth it.
1,bike rack,"Overall it looks like a nice product. I feel it was somewhat mis-represented, in that it wasn't made clear that you would have to purchase their bike rack in order to mount the basket on your bike ANOTHER 30 dollars on top of an already expensive basket. Basically had I known I'd be into this thing for OVER 60 dollars I'd never had done it..."
2,"Rating for the package, not the movie","THE BOOGIE MAN WILL GET YOU is a fair-to-middling comedy in which everyone wants it to be funny but it rarely is. Peter Lorre shines and gets the most laughs. Boris Karloff (who got this film as a consolation prize for having missed out on ARSENIC AND OLD LACE) tries too hard. Maxie Rosenbloom is funny in his own low-brow way. Jeff Donnell (where'd she come up with that name?) is good, but Larry Parks (with a mustache he didn't have in the two Jolson movies) is weak. But hey...the title is THE BOOGIE MAN WILL GET YOU. Who decided to shorten it to THE BOOGIE MAN for this release? I wouldn't buy it for that reason alone! Better to get it as part of the ICONS OF HORROR set."
4,Tantra Review,"Great, informative video about Tantra, and has definitely peaked my husband's and my interest in taking a massage class.It doesn't hurt that the tantra ""students"" are both HOT!"
5,Tantra,This is one of the best erotic videos we have seen. It explains how to give really great massages and shows real couples exploring each other's bodies. This has definitely helped my husband and I spice up our sex life.
3,too much dort,"I just bought this yesterday. I'm on my way to take it back. When you empty the dirt container you must also take the filter out- By Hand- and ""tap it against the inside of a trash can"". This means you have to touch the dirty filter and release the dirt into the air when you knock it off the filter. The machine DOES pick up a lot of dirt, but I am not interested in coming into contact with it!!!"
2,Not worth the money,"I got this vacuum 2 years ago and I don't like using it. It is very hard to push. The swivel guide is more of a pain than helpful. To empty it you need to go outside so you can bang the filter that is in the center of all the dirt, which then gets all over. (very messy) It is also heavy. This vacuum does do a great job of getting the dirt. ( execpt along the edges you have to use the hose for that)"
1,No Suction....Whats the point vacuuming?,"I have owned my Dirt Devil Vision for 2 years. As of just recently I have had nothing but problems with this machine! Just today the suction hose which wraps completely around the unit decided it had enough of my crap! Figuratively! Now with alot of animals and 3 kids making constant messes I no longer have a vacuum! I have encountered the same dilemmas with it as the others who have written reviews (the messy canister, the vacuum tipping over and 3 belts breaking). For the price of this vacuum it should be able to at least do what they say its capable of doing!"
2,noisy,"I paid 270 CAD, and it came with 1 year warranty in Canada(US counterparts give 2-4 years warranty). Its really noisy,and hard to hear even phone ring when it works. I've used it 2 for years, and now motor is dead although it has motor guard system. Now I'm looking for another brand, I don't recommend this product."
5,Old Time Fun!!,"This is a replica of the game I grew up with in the 1960's!!! Board and game pieces are exactly the same as I remember it, but comes packaged in a MUCH MORE sturdy wooden box. I can share part of my youth with my family. Great to get the family together for a fun activity"
2,Not for hardwood floors!,"Although the description for the item claims that it works well on hardwood floors, that is certainly not my experience. The first time I used the vacuum, it left scratches on my floor! So beware!"
5,Great little machine,I purchased this to use in the cars and for my hard surface flooring. It works great on the kitchen floors - light and easy to move around. Also works great on carpeted car flooring. Even picks up the dog hair in the carpets.
4,Good for hardwood floors,"I bought this vacuum for my hardwood floors and it works great. It's very light, easy to clean and rolls well. It's absolutely not made for carpets though and it is very loud."
3,Sucks for carpet,"Great for wood and tile floors. Sucks for carpet. Thankfully, our house is only carpeted in the living room and upstairs bonus room, or we would have returned it. There isn't a beater bar on the vacuum head on this model; if we had known/noticed that, we wouldn't have purchased it."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I don't like the entire vacuum being plastic. Plus it is too lightweight.It keeps moving when I am vacuuming. It doesn't pick up very well on rugs. It does okay on my hardwood floors.But I do have many rugs throughout the house, so it would be nice if it had more suction when cleaning the rugs. Was a decent price."
2,Good for quick pick-ups on hardwood but messy to empty,"If you want to use this vacuum on any type of carpeting, do not buy it. I do not use it on carpeting. It just doesn't work on my area rugs. I have two dogs and three active boys. It works well on the hardwood floors in the upstairs of my house, and I like that I can carry it on my shoulder with the strap and move around. However, my dogs spend the most time in the downstairs level of my home, and this vacuum can't handle all the hair. The head gets clogged and hair gets stuck all over it. I also find emptying the dirt cup a messy job and the dog hair just won't come right out because of static cling. I always empty it outside, which is a pain when it is really cold or there is snow. It is also very loud compared to other vacuums, both large and small, that I have owned over the years.Overall it is good for quick-pick ups on hardwood floors or tile. You will find it is a good vacuum for this purpose."
2,Not great,"We purchased this vacuum several years ago for our apartment with all wood floors. The unit itself is just awkward. The hose disconnects from the unit every time I vacuum. The attachments fall off or come disconnected while using. Storing the unit is annoying, as it constantly falls over and gets in the way. The suction is mediocre at best. The HEPA filter needs to be replaced frequently, at a cost of $20 to $30 a pop. I would not reccommend this product."
3,It's average and OK,"This serves the purpose we bought it for but I can't say it's fabulous. It works great on hard surface floors and uses a HEPA filter that can be washed/rinsed so I like it. It is noisy. For the money, it's a good buy."
4,Dirt devil travel vac,This is perfect if you have several levels and need to clean stars as well-strap hangs easily on shoulder and it wheels as well. It's nice and light for carrying and provides pretty good suction. The best part is it releases no dust as opposed to bag vacuums or sweeping.
4,Works like a charm,"Replaced a 30+ year old canister with the Dirt Devil. It's compact, easy to use and efficient. Our only complaint is that it is quite noisy, so we happily use ear plugs while using it for bare floors and dusting. Excellent product for the price."
2,disappointed,"I needed a small vac for my floors. Unfortunatly, this one was not what I've expected! noisy, heavy, and the nozzle was falling off from time to time. I've sent it back."
3,works ok,im not happy with this vacuum at all. the attachments are made of cheap flimsy plastic. doesn't pick up stuff off the carpet very good. i have to go back and forth over things that are just laying there in order to suck them up. really wish i had bought something else. but it will have to do.
3,Okay for bare floors,"I bought this vacum because I wanted one that was light weight. It is very light and easy to carry/pull around. It works good for vacuming bare wood floors. But you need to use a light touch when operating. Don't push down while vacuming...let it lightly go over the surface. I only use it on the carpet when I am doing a light clean up. It is not the vacum to use if you want deep thorough cleaning for carpets. But for the price it was a deal and works good for my everyday pick up in the kitchen/dining area, where it is only bare floor."
2,Not what I expected,Well based on the other reviews I order this vacuum. I should have known it was too good to be true. The hose constantly fell out of the machine and the floor tool kept coming off. Very cheaply made. I will be returning and getting a Miele.
2,"poor construction, cheap plastic and suction power",Oh I miss the European vacuum cleaners. You can actually get someting decent for under $80 there. This one is *relatively* inexpensive but feels really cheap. I bet it won't last long. Suction power is way way way below the average too. Picks up dust quite well but bigger junk doesn't go through.
5,Buy the Breeze - you won't regret it!,"I love love love this vacuum. It's light, has all the attachments I like (small brush, large brush, crevice). Bagless, and easy to empty canister. Does great on hardwood floors, and even on tough jobs. (This is not the vacuum for you if you have a lot of carpet. It works fine on low-pile though). The reason I wrote this review is because of how versatile this machine is. Today we were sanding exposed beams in our 20 foot high attic, and this vacuum worked like a charm to get the beams clean! It comes with a strap so you can sling it across your back and go anywhere with it. I purchase this vacuum because my grandmother has it - it's a great size for older people as well, because it's not too heavy, and they can maneuver it easily."
4,Hard working and durable,This is my second Breeze vacuum. I love it. The first one lasted ten years. I notice the first one allowed a hepa filter to be inserted at exhaust and this one does not. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.
4,Dirt Devil 082500 Breeze Bagless Canister Vacuum,It's a nice unit a little noisy but since it's so compact it's easy to store.
1,It's not what I expected. Does not have to much power.,Most of the time I end up sweeping floors with broom which is something I was avoiding to avoid stirring mess all over. It lacks power. Very disappointed with product :(
2,Dirt Devil Dud,"Vacuum worked great when I initally got it for small around the home uses like around baseboards and spills, however after about a month of use the suction got weaker. At the 6 month mark I just don't use it anymore because I find it just doesn't pick up anything. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Good value for hardwood floor maintenance,"This is a good value for a lightweight vac that can be used to keep hardwood floors clean on a daily basis. It doesn't work very well on tile or carpet. It has a very long cord, but it isn't retractable, which is a pain. For the money, however, it does basically what I need it to do."
1,Poor quality,Works great for a while but the plastic tubing is so fragile it broke after a few months use. Pay a little more and get metal tubing with a Royal.
1,do not buy!!!!!!!!!,"Horrible, never worked, won't return my item, is a piece of junk!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! (EVEN AMAZON.COM WON'T RETURN FOR ME) IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. (NO STARS!!!)"
5,Best All Around,"I have a vacuum on each of 3 floors, both upright and canister. In the past 3 years I have replaced all the canisters with the Breeze Bagless Canister.Great suction and light weight. Couldn't be more pleased. In fact, I have purchased one for my daughter-in-law and two for my daughter."
2,"Good suction power, but....","The carpet nozzle is very flimsy...I'm glad I saved the one from my old Dirt Devil can vac. The floor brush doesn't seem to pick up dirt very well, either. Personally, I prefer using throw-away bags...too much dirt & dust flies all over when I'm emptying the cannister (have started going outside to empty it). I bought this model to replace the Dirt Devil can vac I had for years that finally died...not a good replacement at all."
2,"Good on wood, braided rugs, hopeless on carpet","I have a small townhouse and replaced my huge upright vacuum with this sleek canister. It has powerful suction and works well on wood and very dense rugs such as the braided rugs in my dining and bed rooms. However, it is hopeless at picking up cat hair on carpet. You really need a vacuum with a power brush to get up cat hair on carpet.The filter is also icky to clean. Fine dust really sticks to the filter. Plus, I find I don't want to see my dirt!"
4,So light and easy to handle.,"I am enjoying my new vacuum. It is sooo light and easy to handle. I can vacuum much longer without wearing myself out.It does a great job. Would hate for you to see all it picks up! It is not FUN to empty the canister, but that's part of the deal. I'd rather do that than drag a partially filled bag around as I clean."
2,you get what you pay for...,"Nice packaging, convenient canister design is very easy to use adn lightweight, BUT:1. You have to empty the canister about every 10 minutes in order to maintain decent suction,2. Emptying it is a pain, you get covered in dust and practically have to use your fingers to get debris out of the filter.We resold ours and opted for a Dyson instead, which cost almost 4 times as much but worked like a dream!"
1,Broken on contact,"The vaccuum broke the first time we used it. The motor over heated and stopped working almost immediately. The return process was simple and easy, and maybe we just got a lemon, but I wouldn't buy this item again."
2,Dirt Devil 082500 Breeze is not as Advertised!,"Length:: 1:06 MinsWatch for yourself.I give this product a 2.5 out of 5 stars.It works a little better if no tools have been attached. However, now you are left with a quarter sized radius of suction. That would only take you all day to clean one room. I highly recommend buying something else. This product is a complete waste of money."
1,Heavier than anticipated & falls over a lot,The suction seems ok - other than that it's much heavier than I thought & it falls over all the time making it very hard to move around. The cord is too short and the hose keeps coming off the main unit. Not worth buying - I'm going to throw it away.
4,"Good suction, flimsy construction","Recently had the house tiled, so we needed to replace our upright with something easier to use. After doing some research, we settled on this Dirt Devil 082500 canister. It has impressive suction, and is easy to use. The hose, fittings, and dirt cup latch are all very flimsy and we are worried about the long-term. So far so good. On sale, it seems like a decent purchase."
4,Tough little Vac but needs a couple changes,"I've purchased two of these little vacs....and if you keep the canister clean it's got great suction. I tossed the plastic floor brush, though and use the bristle black one that comes with it exclusively. Have suggestions, though...first, the carry strap which I found extremely useful lasts about a week and this happened on both vacs..the clips are just too delicate for the job they are designed to do. And the hose end that fits into the vac SUCKS...again, poorly designed. I remedied that problem with some sticky tape. Looks awful, but keeps the hose attached. I beat the hell out of vacs. REALLY...and run them daily over hardwood floors and rugs and around the Wood cook stove where I pick up chunks of charcoal, bits of wood kindling,ashes and this little Vac soldiers on beautifully. Doesn't take up too much room, and inexpensive enough to replace often."
3,Dirt Devil,I was very happy with the swift delivery. I use this little vac. for hardwood floors and to clean my car. For that I'm satisfied it's very light weight and has plenty of power for those jobs. I don't recommend using it for carpeting.
1,Nice at first but then...,When we first got this it worked great for the first few uses then the suction died on it. Replacing the filter still didn't help. It was trashed later down the road. not recommended
5,Dirt Devil Rules,"This is our third Dirt Devil over the past 15 years. We have one in the garage, one on the porch in a closet and one in the house. We like three machines because of the different stuff they pick up( garage stuff, vs house stuff, vs outside stuff). We chose this particular vacume because of the permanent filter which is easy to clean with a hose and how light and easy it is to move around. You have a winner with this Dirt Devil."
2,fair,"I find the hose is not made well enough for what I use it for, 2 to 3 times a day vacuuming cat litter up. I believe the hose may last at least a year which is good, but I had trouble with the other dirt devil I had with the hose giving out on me quickly. I was unable to buy another hose for that one as it was discontinued, so I had to buy a new vacuum. If dirt devil could make a better, more durable hose, that would be a definite plus."
2,Not worth the mess.,"One would think that Dirt Devil would come up with a sleeve to go over the fluted filter to make cleaning it easier. As it is, dust clumps and sticks in the filter grooves. If you need a hepa filter for allergies, then get covered in dust cleaning the thing, it makes no sense."
1,don't buy this vacuum cleaner,"Yes this canister vac is bagless, but what exactly does that mean? It means wear a surgical mask when you empty the bin because the dust and dirt will go flying... (they tell you to replace them every other year...HA! that might work if you have a small apartment with no rugs, kids, animals or dirt.) This is a bad deal all around. Approach with utmost caution."
3,It's OK,"I bought this vacuum cleaner for the air filter because, at the time, it was about ... less than a HEPA filter vacuum. I also wanted to try a bagless vacuum cleaner.The suck power of this vacuum is good, but not about to pull up any carpet. I found that having a bagless is not all it's cracked up to be - especially since trash and dirt are affected by static electricity and don't always pour right out. Make sure you clean the filter outside -- banging it around inside the house will just put dust back into the air.The vacuum is compact and stores well. I'm a little displeased with the handles, though. I don't think they're air tight enough.3 stars means I'm satisfied, but when it's time to get a new vacuum I'll look for a different one."
4,Great Vacuum,I have been very happy with this vacuum. The bagless feature is great as this is my first vacuum without a bag. I find the suction excellent and the cord long enough and the abilty to move the canister around effortless. I would not suggest this vacuum to someone with a lot of carpet. I have hard wood floors in my entire home. I have two area rugs and the vacuum does a good job but is excellent on my hard wood.
4,Good and powerful,"We purchased this little vaccum for about 2 mo and are very pleased. It provides great suction and manuverability. We can easily clean the old dark corners like the floor underneath our beds and air duct of central AC. It's very lightweight and we don't need to wrestle with it to get the job done.The missing star is mainly from the cleaning of itself. You definitely need to clean the vaccum outside the house, and use another small vaccum (like the ones for cleaning car seats) to clean up the HEPA filter. This is okay for us since we already have a little vac handy. For those who don't, you might want to think about it."
4,Strong but loud,Pros- very strong- good for tile and corners- compact and light- good for the priceCons- head piece is a little flimsy- electric plug is too small for standard outlet (keeps falling out of socket)- loud
3,OK...but,"This vacuum does a decent job cleaning however, it is the loudest vacuum I have ever had or heard. I am dissapointed with my purchase and will go back to a Royal canister vacuum next time if not sooner."
1,Expected more for the money,I like the fact that this vacuum is light weight and you dont have to change the filter but it takes forever to clean my carpet because its doesnt vacuum good. It feels like there is power missing so it takes me like the double amount of time. I wouldnt suggest buying it for that money!
2,"Fine for a small 1 bed apt, NOT for a 4 bedroomed house!!","Got my new dirt devil today, took it out of the box & was shocked by how small it is! I've owned 2 canister vacuums & 2 uprights (all bagless HEPA)over the years but the suction on this one is garbage! Its like vacuuming with a toy. The head of the vacuum is minature & it would take hours to vacuum my 4 bedroom house. I wanted another canister vacuum because they are more light weight, easy to manuver & great for stairs, but this dirt devil breeze is useless. Its the first dirt devil i've owned & it'll be the last, as im about to return it. I expected much more considering the recommended retail price was $129."
1,Don't buy it. It won't last,We bought this vacuum cleaner as a second cleaner for the lighter jobs around the house. We were satisfied with it until its sudden death in its 13th month (thusshortly after the expiration of the warranty). One more item in the landfill!
2,Very little power,"Very light and compact, and probably would work well on non-carpeted floors. However, it's not even as powerful as my little electric broom. Did not pick up most of the items I could see on the carpet, so I had to re-vacuum with a more powerful vacuum."
3,worth the money,if you are looking for a cheaper vacuum - the Dirt Devil could be it. It's not the high power vacuum but ok for the price.The best is that you don't have to deal with the filter bags.
5,Amazon reviews tell it like it is.,I read the Amazon reviews prior to purchase and found them very helpful and truthful. This is not the first Dirt Devil Vacuum I have purchased and I am very pleased with it.
4,review for the Dirt Devil 082500,I already had the machine and liked it so much i purchased another one for the downstairs. It is lightweight enough to pick up and the long hose permits reach the ceiling corners. And i like the see thru canister. And pickup suction better than more expensive models i have owned.
4,Dirt Devil Breeze Canister Vacuum,"Great product for hardwood or tile floors. I have two Sheltie puppy's and this little power house whips through my house in no time. One down side, not recommended with any type of carpeting."
4,Most Unbelievable Thing I Have Ever Seen,I just watched this film and was inspired to immediately write about it. I would not believe this to be legit if I hadn't watched this film. I figured it was like most carnival side shows in the '40s....phony. But this proves it to be true.The movie itself is very artsy yet very factual and in many places quite funny. The people from this little town of Fruita take this thing very seriously.Definitely worth the money.
2,Converter breaks within 1 week.,"I purchased this converter on Amazon, thinking it was a good price. I installed the converter. I am a master certified mechanic and it was installed correctly. All went well for a week and then one of the small tubes that are welded to the side broke off. It was totally unsatisfactory. I would not purchase a Walker product again."
3,average rating.,there are a number of good steps taught in this video except the instructional text that keeps popping up which are distracting and time consuming.
5,Interesting and fun!,"Okay, I must admit that I'm the type of person who is fascinated by nature documentaries. I picked up this book on a whim, and loved every page - it's like a PBS special on paper! I found that it includes an impressive cross-section of naturalists throughout history, all over the world. Sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking, but always profound and sincere, this book was simply a delight. I even learned a bit.My favorite section was the one on the mating habits of scorpions - the gentleman who documented the scenes was touching in his simple joy of nature and observation. I felt affection for many of these dedicated writers who took such pleasure in watching nature without feeling the need to destroy and display it. It's pretty light reading - and perhaps could be a good ""bathroom book"" but is inspiring in a quiet way. Recommended!"
2,THIN PLOT,"plot interesting, but the story line too erratic to supportthe story. More connecting stuff needed to make theplot reasonable"
5,Awsome head,"This head it great. I have had this head on two of my sticks and it has never failed me. It's strong and stirty. The head has not cracked once so i got another one. I used my old one on the street pretty rough and it hasnt cracked, chipped, or gotten weak. If your looking for a good quality head that isnt real expensive get this one. And by the way it goes great on a kryptopro wirefade."
3,"Fine, for a drama made in the early 1970's","Hard to enjoy it despite a number of quality actors. (John Mills's, Margaret Leighton's, and Ralph Richardson's performances were well done; Chamberlain's character was just a difficult one for me to enjoy). It isn't a comfortable theme, although it is worth contemplating. Sarah's totally out-of-period hair and initial costume continually distracted much of what insight I would have had into her character."
3,Picture doe not correcctly represent what is included in the box,"I paid an extra $30 to purchase the ""starter"" kit for a gift thinking the recipient would be able to actually get started using his fun, new camera. However, the kit does not come with film or batteries (even though the product picture includes them). I wish I had just purchased the camera & not spent the extra $30 for a ""coffee table"" book & a roll of tape."
3,No Film Included,"The specs are not explicit in saying NO FILM IS INCLUDED.If you want this to be a useful gift, buy some film too."
4,GIFT PURCHASE,PURCHASED AS CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR GRANDSON (HIS REQUEST). HE LOVED IT AND SEEMS TO ENJOY USING.
3,Eh,"I was under the impression that this kit contained batteries and film. It does not. Know that ahead of time! When I received the kit, the flash in the camera did not work, so they were very understanding and are sending me a new one plus film and batteries. The books and instruction manuals are pretty helpful! I really enjoyed that."
3,False Picture,"The camera itself is awesome, I have no problems with it. But the picture of what comes in the kit is rather misleading. It's really just the camera, instructions, and a book. Theres no film or batteries. So just make sure you get some film when you're ordering this kit...there isn't any in it."
1,Frustrating,"I suggest that those who have not even experienced this type off photography,to not get It. I was confused and frustrated on not knowing how to use it after hours of research tutorials . I recommend this to experienced peopleLomographic Holga Starter Kit"
2,A Major Disappointment!!,"This year(2010) i got the Holga Starter Kit for Christmas. I was my first time using a camera like this so I was super excited to start taking pictures with it. Since it DOESN'T come with film i had to use the only film i had at hand which was 35mm film. After two days of taking pictures with the Holga I went to develop my photos at Walgreens, big mistake. A hour later I arrived to find my pictures a horrible mess, all of the frames were half picture half black. All of the pictures came out below what i actually wanted to take a picture of. Because of all of this I am returning my Holga and I don't recommend this camera to beginners."
5,Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse - The Complete Series,"Watching the cartoon brought me back to my childhood. Although the cartoon is rudimentary as compared to today's high tech animation, it was still as powerful as ever. Always loved the string bass in the theme music and The Frog, whose voice was patterned after the late Edward G. Robinson."
2,COURAGEOUS CAT & MINUTE MOUSTE-THE COMPLETE SERIES,"GREAT THAT THEY RELEASED THESE DVD'S.SORRY TO SAY THEY ARE NOT REMASTERED, SO IT'S JUST O.K."
2,"$71.99, What Are They Smokin?????","Ummm, nostalgia aside, I remember watching this really cheaply made cartoon emass in reruns through my childhood, almost shown as much as the quality WB Bugs Bunny stuff made during the movie era. But over 70.00 for this stuff? Now thats a little out of line. I dont think I'd spend more than 15.00 for this stuff, nostalgia or not, and thats really the only people who would want to watch this stuff. Its really cheap stuff and very repetative. 5 stars for the opening sequence and music and 2 stars for the rest and that pricetag."
2,They made 130 of these?!,"I'm all for nostalgia and all but this DVD set does little to invoke any sense of it for me. About the best part of the series is the theme music and intro. I remember little else about the series, having last seen it nearly 30 years ago (!) in black & white. Watching these episodes again I find that instead of being fun, the series is ludicrous: the animation is bad, the plots are nonsensical, Courageous Cat's gun-for-every-situation is ridiculous and Minute Mouse is 100% useless; it almost boggles the mind that 130 of these cartoons were created. As another reviewer stated, these shorts can get tiresome quickly and watching no more than 3 or 4 at a time is recommended. Unfortunately, I rented the first disc from Netflix.com and, not wanting to hold onto the disc too long, am forcing myself to watch 11 shorts at a stretch (good thing they're only 5 minutes long) so I can send it back from whence it came as soon as possible. Feels more like a chore than a nostalgia trip."
2,Corageous Cat,Not really exciting as an adult but I must say it probably wasn't my favourite back then either I just remembered it vaguely. Definately for kids and great to show your own kids and feel safe about what they are watching.
5,Cute lion backpack!,"This Plush Goliath Lion Backpack has a lot of room. It holds a decent amount of clothing and objects, much more than I originally thought it would. I purchased it to carry shoes, make up, water, and a sweater, which all fit inside. The straps are sturdy, and can be adjusted to any length. It's very cute, and gets a lot of compliments. The only (minor) problem is sometimes when you are zipping up the backpack, the fake fur from the mane gets caught. I would also ignore the educational value score I gave it, considering it is a backpack."
4,"If you really love guitar, this book is for you.","Warning, this book is not for those picking up a guitar for the first time. The book focuses mainly on theory and therefore should not be used as a starting point for building dexterity.However, once you build some dexterity, this book has a lot of information that a real guitarist needs to know. When i say real, i mean someone who knows how to actually create music as opposed to someone who knows how to repeat songs. That is what the book is for, to create music, and learning this difficult art takes time and patience, so don't rush through the chapters. Also, the keys to the riffs given are indicated and finding the right scale pattern(s) of each riff is a way of learning as opposed to having everything handed on a silver platter. This is what makes this book so effective. So if you buy this book, remember, this book requires a lot of patience, time, and dedication and is NOT for the lazy musician."
2,this book is just plain frustrating,"I am a self taught guitarist playing for 2 years, and every time I sit down and try to learn something from this book I just get pissed off.The authors give you riffs to play over the cd, but don't explain where the riffs come from or how to play them. The very first riffs are difficult and frustrating.You are slapped in the face with scale after scale after scale and variations within them, then given an often too-fast chord progression and a riff that is hard to decipher. Find a better book to learn this."
1,"A very confusing, scattered approach to teaching guitar","This book has held me back for way to long. I finally decided to try some different teaching methodologies, and I am finding that everything else is opening up my eyes to the fretboard. I went back to review this book last night after letting it sit for a year, and was horrified by the knowledge gaps that this book assumes the reader not know. This book is horrible. I think it is meant for people who already have music degrees (theory training) and want to transfer that knowledge to the fretboard. However, if you're a intermediate guitarist with basic theory knowledge, this is NOT the book for you...."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"This book and cd arent worth the paper its printed on. I bought this book and immediately came home and popped it in my cd player. To my horror the progressions it supplies for you to solo over are date, non-spectacular and boring. They were all done the a drum machine, a generic keyboard and a sequencer. Its actually painful to listen to. With all the amazing technology out there you would think that a school with such a great reputation would put out products of quality. Next, the example soloing techniques are more of the same flat, boring and non-spectacular. I am actually annoyed I wasted my money on such a crappy book. DONT BUY THIS!"
4,great window fan,"I've had several of these close the window-on-it types of fans, and this is one of the better variants I've owned. I tried a single lasko fan that was much bigger and moved more air by far (I wish this one moved a BIT more), but the problem was that when it was off, the gap in the fan was so big bugs were getting thru etc. This one is tighter. It's very hard to find any data on the amount of air these types of fans move, or the motor size...this one is pretty good, but not great."
4,"Good Fan, Gets Dirty","I bought one of these several years ago and am now getting a new one. It's a reliable and quiet fan, and I do like it. I've not had any of the problems described in the other reviews.Be forewarned, though, that as a window fan pulling everything in from outside, it WILL get very dirty. There's no way to put a filter on it, and it's not designed to be taken apart and washed. Furthermore, as a result of being exposed to the elements, the plastic ultimately becomes dry, brittle, and easily breakable. This is a good fan while it lasts, but it's not designed to last forever."
3,Not bad for the price,"This fan blows more outward than straight unlike my 15 year old Advantage window fan. It's great for cooling the entire room but for being close by it for the air to blow in your direction not so. The plastic is sturdy,the fan seems pretty well built. Unfortunately their is no way to open the fan to clean it. The Thermastat control seems only there for looks, I see no point in it since I haven't notice a difference, if you turn the thermastat down the fan stops so that was something that was a let down. But the individual reversible fan blades are a +. This is about as much as I noticed aboue this fan."
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap......","Made totally out of flimsy plastic. Side extensions to close off area on left and right of fan, don't stay extended. Screws are suppose to hold them in place, but they don't work. Air movement mediocre at best. Not worth the 39.99 price tag. Save your money go to a Walmart or similar and check out the displays first."
1,Flawed side panels,"The fan works just fine, but the side panels do not. When you pull the panels out they tend to slip back into the fan, leaving undesirable draft space on the sides. Also, instead of a convenient side panel locking mechanism there is a screw set. Two strikes."
2,Inferior plastic product,The accordion panels on the side are cheaply made. The screws that are suppose to hold the panels to the width of the windows do not hold the panels at all.It is a quiet fan but the panels are irritating.
1,Almost Useless Fan (please see comments),"I purchased this fan some time ago. Tried to use it a few times, but the windows were never the right size for a good fit. I am giving up on this fan and putting them in my garage.Update:7/22/11As per my discussion with K. Irwin, I would raise the stars on this fan to 3 instead of 1, as K. Irwin pointed out that it is not the fan's fault that it didn't fit in any of my windows. Please refer to the first 3 comments on this post.Thank you, Cate"
4,Great Fan,"I am using this fan as a test in my restaurant. I have a problem area that holds smoke and cooking odors in my dining room and I have installed this fan vertically in a small sliding window next to one of the guest tables. To be honest with you, when I first turned this thing on I expected it to move more air and be alot louder. But as it sits I have found that it actually does a very good job at getting rid of a very noticable amount of odor and smoke (without taxing my A/C system!). And my customers can sit next to it and not even notice that it is running! Most likely I will probably keep this unit as long as it runs and be quite satisfied with the results, especially knowing that a commercial unit would cost several hundred dollars more and most likely have to be professionally installed..$$$$$."
1,never got to use it,I live in an apartment in an old house so keeping it cool is a big priority. I took this out of the box and it never got in the window. The accordion part of the fan that adjusts to fit in the window has two fastening screws to keep it in position...well they don't work. I tried and tried but They would not stay out to fit my window. So back it went..
3,A Coffee-table Book &#65533; but no more,"If you want a coffee table book, then buy it. The photographs by Hu Chui are stunning, and the reproductions of Chinese scrolls and paintings are excellent.However, the information about the Forbidden City is at the breakfast mush level - easy to digest but of little value. The information is superficial, and often inaccurate. Knowledgeable students of the Forbidden City will groan, and wince. It perpetuates blunders such as referring to the East Glory Gate as the East 'Flowery Gate,' and the Chinese advisor on eunuchs knows little about the subject. The book talks about emperors as if they all had the same personality and all did the same things.Enjoy the pictures, but take the text with milk and sugar."
2,Great Pictures But Could do more work on the Information,"I had hoped to be reading about the Forbidden City-its origins, its designers, its layout, the function of the buildings and structures, the treasures it contained,the catastrophes it survived and so forth.I was disappointed to find that only the first chapter was of some relevance to the Forbidden City. The rest of the chapters were devoted to the famous ""inhabitants"", the officers ranking system, concubines, eunuchs, the foreign priests and so forth.The books saving grace is the breath-taking photography. But then some of the pictures I felt were rather irrelevant to the Forbidden City ie Yong Zheng's concubines, Kang Xi's various potraits.In conclusion, this is a good book for browsing through the pictures, but not for the serious historian."
3,Good family fun!,"This movie will keep the kids entertained time and again. I thought that it might be low on production values but I was pleasantly surprised. The story evolves around a would be magician who comes across a ring that once belonged to the famed Merlin. Johnny, with the aid of the ring, manages to make his sister really dissappear. He enlists the aid of his best friend and his TV magician idol to venture back in time so that he may learn how to bring his sister back before his parents find out.This movie is recommended as suitable film for kids of all ages."
5,So far so good,"Despite Amazon's car part finder saying this wouldn't fit my 2001 Camry LE with V6 engine, several car parts stores suggested this exact model as a replacement. I went ahead and ordered it and I haven't noticed any problems with it.Edit: And I managed to leave the gas cap on the trunk of my car again...ordering another one. Had no problems whatsoever in the three months I had it. Just need a new brain along with the new cap...."
2,Not so good for a 2001 Miata,"It fits the tank but it sits so high that it makes the cover very hard to close -- and worse, hard to open."
2,'98 Honda CRV: no,"It fit the fuel tank but didn't turn off the Check Engine Light which was indicating an emission problem, according to the computer code read at AutoZone."
4,Nice morph of all global spiritualities... to one deck,"inspriring to use and learn more about other spirituality angles from other parts of the world, still very much like our own."
5,"A rich, beautiful deck crammed with global culture symbolism","The Haindl deck is one of the most multicultural I've ever encountered. Instead of the Anglo prototypes prevalent since the Rider-Waite, Hermann Haindl uses India, Egypt, England, and America as his four suits. He also uses Norse runes, Hebrew letters, and I Ching characters on each card. It's lovely and visually enticing, and it truly speaks to the experienced reader. It's a good intermediate deck, perhaps a bit too full for the neophyte reader"
2,Nothing special,There is nothing great about this book. It might be OK for a novice (but then there are so many other books in the market). Information in this book could be easily obtained from Oracle documentation...no need to spend money on the book. Just another Oracle book.
3,"Good coverage of topics, but with many error","This book covers many topics quite well. However there are several errors in the Tuning session. The book is titled 8i Tuning and Administration, but mentions many parameters that are obsolete in 8i (DB_BLOCK_WRITE_BATCH on page 460). Also, it is mentioned to look at rclm/s for sar -p. but sar -p does not have a rclm/s value (even in the eg. table on pg 435). The correct value to look for is atch/s."
4,Great Concert,This concert was filmed in the historic Tennessee Theater. I was lucky enough to be there that night. It was a very memorable concert. Not as much energy as the Other Voices concert however.
4,One Criticism,"I've been a fan of Nanci Griffith for years. I couldn't wait to buy this DVD when I saw it was available. Like the other reviewers, the music is great. What's not to like? But.....I couldn't believe that she would issue a DVD in only 2-channel sound. Why on earth would you use the latest technology of DVD, and then not utilize 5.1 channel sound? This was a huge disappointment, and prospective customers should know this, since the package does not specify the sound specs."
5,Interesting format,"This book is written for an individual that needs to find out how things work and how to get where they want to go. In other words, almost everybody. It really is a self-teaching guide. As you begin to read the book, you are instructed to go to a different section depending on your answers to questions. That way, you are finding out specifically what you need, and don't have to wade through lots of information that would apply to others, but not necessarily yourself. Not only does it cover 'making it in the system' it also goes over Improving General Reading Ability, Reading Textbooks, Writing Short Papers, Writing Term Papers, and taking Exams. Very useful."
2,"Touches on a lot of topics, but not in detail","The book has a lot of information in it; although, it doesn't go into much detail leaving me with more questions rather than answers.Also, the book does not cover the current line of HP scanners. It talks a lot about the DeskScan II software which, evidently, came with previous HP models; however, DeskScan II is not shipped with the current line of HP scanners. And the PrecisionScan software which does come with current scanners does not have the same features/capabilities as the DeskScan II software."
2,Not very good,I wanted a tutorial to learn how to use my new scanner. This book is for intermediate users. I am a beginner.
5,Good,"I was told that this book is a good intro to more ""adult"" graphic novels. It's good, but I never got into comics. Except for Wolverine"
3,A Decent Read,"This book is good if you are interested in reading about sexuality. Really, to me it was about how a young girl is trying to find herself. she's confused about who she should date, men or women? i liked it but i dont think i would read it more than two times.It's not even about the death of speedy, speedy didn't die. this pissed me off pretty much.So i gave it three stars."
2,2 have broken on me so far,"I purchased one of these heaters, but within a week the motor began making an awful squealing noise. I exchanged it for a new one. This one lasted about a month and then the heating element died. I liked the heater when it worked, but the overall quality seems to be lacking."
5,Wonderful,"This book has become such a great health resouce for me. I purchased it after hearing Dr. Cowan's lecture at a Weston Price comference. It has helped me, and I will be purchasing 2 more to send to my children. Thank you so much."
5,Revolutionary and Inspiring,"Having just attended the Fourfold Path to Healing Conference in Oakland, CA, (www.fourfoldhealing.com) I feel absolutely inspired to spread the messages of this book. If you are looking for a new approach to health and well-being, yet not ""new fad"", if you believe in the wisdom of traditional peoples, and you want to help co-create a beautiful world of healthy individuals and societies, this is the book to read. It is very attractive, well-organized, and will definately introduce you to some new ways of perceiving our bodies and bringing them to wholeness.I also recommend the other books by contributer Sally Fallon, especially Nourishing Traditions."
1,More mystical hogwosh than good science,"I have enjoyed Nourishing Traditions, by Sally Fallon, so I bought Cowan's book b/c it is advertised as a ""companion"" to Fallon's book. Fallon's book is an objective assessment of the often misleading information out there about nutrition. Her book is clearly presented and backed by copious notes. I was hoping Cowan's book was equally objective and convincing. Well, the best chapter is the one written by Fallon!Cowan's book is weakened by his reliance on the theories of Rudolf Steiner, guru of ""anthroposophy"". Whatever contributions Steiner may have(or may not have) made to the field of education, his scientific theories are just goofy. Cowan bases his entire book on Steiner's four bodies or spheres of activity, which correspond to the four ""kingdoms"" or ""elements"" of body as forwarded by the medievalists 7 centuries ago. Okay, this stuff is for fairy tales! If the Steiner slant had been made clear on the back cover, I would not have purchased the book."
5,"This is a great companion to ""Nourishing Traditions""","I've been following a ""real foods"" kind of traditional diet in making meals for my family for several years now. We eat as organically and locally as possible, even growing much of our own food in garden and greenhouse. This book just fills in some more of the blanks towards being truly healthy--body, soul, spirit. The author, Dr. Cowan, brings a 4-part emphasis to healthy lifestyle--diet, movement, therapeutics (healthy alternatives to pharmaceuticals), and meditation. While I can't always agree with his philosophical foundation (I'm a Christian), I do think he has a lot of meaty information to bring about positive changes for a healthier life. It's fascinating reading at the very least, combined with in-depth, holistic healing suggestions."
5,Fourfold Path to Healing,"I am a student of Naturopathy and had to buy this book after checking it out of the library. Cowan is masterful in presenting a true wholistic healing approach. Having studied the work of many healing masters, I find that his work is solid and rational. I will use his book as a resource and as inspiration."
5,Total shocker,"I love the LvB string quartets so much I try to collect every recording on CD or DVD. I was simply amazed. These guys play superbly. Their interpretation of both quartets is almost flawless. The four instruments are balanced in tone and dynamics, and the tempo at every turn is perfect. These are just superb performances. I'm now eagerly searching for other LvB string quartets recorded by these guys. (They've also issued CDs for Op. 18 as well Opp. 130&131, but they are hard to find.)"
3,"'Watered"" down Semiconductor Devices","I feel like this book leaves out necessary explanations on solid state physics to appreciate or fully understand semiconductor devices. Knowing that S.M. Sze's other book ""Physics of Semiconductor Devices"" is used as the ""bible"" of semiconductors, I would have preferred that our teacher had used that book instead."
2,Reference book yes... but thats about it,"As a undergrad electrical engineering student I found this book a horrible choice for an introductory level semiconductor class. As another reviewer mentioned, the example problems (the most important part of any textbook) are few and far between. Most of the book is filled with equations and derivations that are overwhelming and confusing. Clearly the author is well versed in the physics of semiconductor devices; however, the presentation of the information leaves any student reader overwhelmed. Maybe this book makes a handy reference, but only after you have been exposed to the material. As for me, I'll be replacing S.M. Sze's ""Semiconductor Devices Physics and Technology"" 2nd Ed with something that makes more sense for a student."
2,Potty Chair,I suppose I should have read the info better. I thought this was a seat that could be used over toilet seats while travelling too. It won't fit on top of a regular toilet seat. It is really just a foldout object a child can sit on to potty outside with plastic baggies underneath. You have to buy more of these potty-specific baggies and they cost as much as the chair. I don't know how many kids would use something like this outside or even in the back of the car.
2,"terribly uncomfortable, skinny seat can't be sat on","I thought this was a great idea, but my daughter can't sit on the seat, and it hurts her when she tries. The seat is so narrow, it's not really a seat. Her legs aren't long enough to straddle it (on her knees). I have to hold her up so she can ""sit"" on it without her full weight pressing down. I'm shopping around for another one...Fisher Price's Potty On-the-Go looks good. Bigger, but at least she can sit."
1,way too small,"This would be a great idea for potty training a newborn. It is way too small. I started potty training my daughter early and even when she was a year old it was too small for her. It sits way too low to the ground, and the seat itself is not even a seat. It's just a plastic ring which must be horribly uncomfortable. My daughter refused to use it, so I'm stuck with it and the extra 4 packs of liners for it."
4,"Great for ""on the go"" parents","At first this potty was not so friendly for me and my daughter, it took us some time until we finally felt comfortable using, but once we hit that stage it is one of the most useful things I have bought in quite a while. My daughter is practically recently trained and we had to go on a trip out of the country, I was a little worried on how we would handle the situation during the trip, but with this portable potty it was so easy, we even used it in the airplane. Highly Recommended..."
1,Too Small,"I purchased this item because my friend had showed me hers and looked like it would be a great travel potty. What i didn't see is that this ""on the go potty"" was extremely small. I would recommend the potette plus instead. Amazon was excellent about returning the item though."
2,"Nice idea, but too small","I was so excited to find a portable potty b/c we like to travel and my son is finally potty training. Well I opened it for the first time about 4 months ago and what a disappointment! My son is 2 and absolutely could not stand sitting on this the first time. It's too small and pinches. I tried to maneuvere his bottom so that it would be more comfortable. no positioning worked. if your child has a tiny bottom then go for it, otherwise, skip this one."
3,Not as sturdy as the 2-in-1 Potette Plus,"We bought the Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus several months before we bought this one. I didn't realize there would be a big difference, but there is! This one (the regular Potette) is definitely less sturdy than the Potette Plus. The legs on the regular Potette have collapsed a few times, with the kid sitting on it. That has never happened with the Plus. Otherwise, it is a great travel potty. We have one in each car."
2,Not what I was hoping for,Not very sturdy. I found it easier to just hold and prop my daughter up than put her on this potty.
3,When they said small they meant small,I read the reviews that mentioned this being small but I never dreamed how small it actually is. It's on it's way back because there is no way this will work for my 3 year old boy. It measured 8.5 inches by 8.5 inches. The hole itself is 5 x 7. I cannot imagine we would get any pee actually in this potty because when he sat on it he was half off the front. It is on the other hand it's very sturdy and I don't think it would fall or anything. You do need the bags with this as there is nothing to it but a seat and legs. If you have a tiny child this might just work for you but if you have a bigger one there is not a chance. We are going to try another brand now. I just need something for the car. I have the fold up one for the big potties.
4,Gotta go!,"This is really compact and comes with 3 bags to get you started as well as a plastic carrying bag. We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car. This is small enough for a diaper bag or under the stroller. Really great idea for potty training and young children who can't ""hold it"" for very long."
1,Not Potette Plus!,"I should have paid closer attention to what I was ordering. This is not the Potette Plus 2-n-1. This one is not nearly as sturdy, and is obviously not versatile. It is only a free standing potty. You cannot open the handles all the way to use as a potty seat on a regular toilet. Spend the extra $5 and get the Plus 2-n-1!"
1,Buy the Plus model,I accidently bought this potty chair instead of the Potette Plus. Please do not make the same mistake. This one does not fold out to fit on a toilet seat which is why I bought it. It folds out to sit on the ground and use with liners. There is no reason to buy this seat when you can buy the plus model and have both options. I wish that I would have read some of the other reviews before I bought it. It might just go in my garbage.
1,Buy the Potette Plus!,"We had a Potette Plus for about a year and it is a fantastic product that held up well and was perfect for both toilet seat use and stand-alone potty use outdoors. Then we accidentally lost it and replaced with this version, not realizing that it can only be used as a stand-alone, and NOT also on toilets such as in restaurants, playground bathrooms, etc. Do yourself a favor and buy the Plus to get maximum use out of this terrific, indispensable product."
4,Worked well overseas.,"I carried this to India since my son started potty training just before we left. Wound up using it with relatives who didn't have conventional Western toilets and restaurants that had toilets that weren't kept clean. This is definitely going in the trunk of my car for any future emergencies. The travel bag it comes with isn't anything to write home about, but it afforded a clean way to carry and store the potty and some refills, along with a few diapers and a travel pack of wipes."
5,Indispensable for little kids,"This is a wonderful, very helpful product. I think it's usefulness goes well beyond potty training. My daughter is completely potty trained, but we still carry this potty in the car so that she doesn't have to use the not-always-sparkling-clean gas station bathrooms when we travel. To me this is an absolute MUST for anybody who likes to travel with children. Its design makes it so convenient that it even fits in my shoulder bag, perfect for those long walks. The portable potty completely eliminates the need for public restrooms, and that to me is absolutely amazing."
5,Worked like a charm,"I was looking for a potty seat for our powder room and happened to stumble onto the On-The-Go potty. It seemed like a good idea so I picked it up. The next day my husband had to take our 3-year-old daughter with him to our older daughter's soccer practice where there isn't a bathroom. Sure enough, our 3-year-old (who we are in the midst of potty training) had to go potty. My husband was able to whip out this potty and it worked perfectly. Now I just need to purchase some additional liners (it comes with 3). I wish I had had this when we were in Florida this summer. It would have really come in handy when we were stuck in line for rides and the kids had to go to the bathroom (instead on having to get out of line, find a bathroom, and then try to find someone to let us back in line with my husband)."
2,"Very small, just like a toy...","Just be aware of its size: it is very small. But on the other hand, it meets the need of easy-use and portability for private time."
3,Our Emergency Potty,"We got this so I didn't have to take all 3 kids out of the car if our 3 yr. old had an bathroom emergency.So far he has tried it but hasn't actually gone on it.The seat is not very big or comfortable,even for our little guy,and that may be part of why he hasn't gone yet.I may upgrade to the one that also fits on a big potty in the hopes it is bigger."
3,okay product great concept,"I just got this portable potty. Our son is a little heavy 34lbs and moves alot at 18 months so although it works we have to cue him to sit still so that it does not collapse on him. But, with the choices available I would purchase this product again."
2,Only works as topper,"I bought this for my almost 3 year old and the first time we tried to use it as a stand up potty it collapsed. I set it up again and it collapsed and pinched his finger. We'll still use it as a topper for the big potty when we're on the go, but I won't try it as a stand-alone again."
4,good potty,"my son seems to enjoy peeing on the little turtle pictures on the absorbent pad inside the plastic bag. The potty only comes with three bags- should come with more. Small, compact and stable."
1,Wobbly seat,"My daughter sat on the seat for the first time and one side folded closed. She refuses to use it since that first experience. If your kid sits perfectly still on it, maybe the legs will stay upright. If they shift slightly, the legs will fold. I don't recommend the seat to anyone."
5,"This + the ""sassy sacks"" = freedom","This potty is a lifesaver. Allows us to go anywhere, anytime. We don't have to worry about nasty public bathrooms or even if one exists. Folds up small and the ""Sassy Sacks"" fit over them perfectly and cost a few pennies per sack (don't buy the massively expensive Kalencom refills!!)"
4,"Great, but different from the Potette Plus","This is a great, very compact potty chair that has kept us from being house bound while potty training. However when I bought it I thought this was the same as the Potette Plus but just came in different colors. It does not however serve to use on top of a regular toilet seat, it can only be used with disposable liner bags. Also the refill bags on Amazon are for the Potette Plus and don't fit this one snugly like the 3 bags that came with it did. They still work, and I think an undamaged plastic shopping bag with a paper towel in it would work fine too."
2,How can I expect her to sit on this?,"I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?My daughter was fairly young when we tried it (we did some early PT, and she was about 10 months old). She's now 2, fully pt, but will still not go near it. If it was so flimpsy for a 10 months old, how would it do under the weight of an older child? Beyond me.I still give it 2 stars, because it's an otherwise neat idea. Impractical execution, though."
2,potette on the go potty,I thing it is to small . my daughter din't liked that much she cry when I seat her in ..
1,very unhappy with this product,"We bought this potty to keep in our car for emergencies for our 15 month old. She has been mostly potty trained since 13 months, but refuses to sit on this chair. It is too short (and she is very small). She loves to sit on her regular potty at home & in the car, but would rather go in her pants than this potty. When she tells me she needs to go, I get her out of her car seat, & as soon as she sees this mini potty, she starts crying. She absolutely hates it. We are very unhappy with this product."
1,Portable potty,"I guess I did not understand exactly what I was ordering. I thought this was a potty seat that hooked to any toilet, and I could take it anywhere and he could use it anywhere. This is not a rational purchase. This is like a port-a-potty... Who is going to let their child use the bathroom out in the complete open?"
3,I should have ordered the other one!,"I ordered this for my son who is potty training. It serves the purpose but I don't like that it doesn't convert to a toilet seat topper, I thought it did....wrong order. I will be ordering the other one for sure!"
2,My son thinks it's weird.,"My kid refuses to try this potty because the seat feels weird to sit on (because you're essentially sitting on a bag. I love the size and the portability, but if the kid won't use it, what's the point?"
1,"Don't make my mistake--buy the Potette Plus, not this!","I accidentally bought this, when I meant to buy another Potette Plus. This is much flimsier, it doesn't stand up as securely as the Potette Plus. In addition, it cannot be used as a topper on top of a toilet. I am throwing it away and buying another Potette Plus. Do not make my mistake, do not buy this! For the extra couple of dollars you get the difference between and awesome product or a mediocre one. I honestly don't know why they even make this anymore. My first Potette Plus has been in heavy use for 18 mos now, and it is still going. We just want another one for the second car. Also, you don't need the refills--a plastic shopping bag and a cheap diaper make a great liner."
4,"Small, but does the job","Yes, it's tiny. Not very comfy for long sits, but great for emergencies, or during potty training while out and about. My 5 yr old has even been known to use it in an emergency (fear of auto-flush toilets). It will easily fit in a diaper bag, although we mainly just keep it under the seat in the minivan for traveling."
2,Too small,This potty seemed like a great idea for on the go potty needs but.... it is too small! My daughter is tall but petite for a 2 year old. She cannot get comfortable on the tiny seat so after a couple of failed attempts she refuses to use it. I read the other reviews commenting on the size and wish that I would have listened to them. I decided to get a regular potty chair to keep in my trunk but use the potette liners with it.
5,Fantastic product,"This on the go potty has helped us train our daughter. Because of the on the go potty, she has never had an accident away from home. It is easy to use. She loves to use it. We set it up in the cargo area of our SUV when she needs to go and there's no convenient bathroom. Great for parks, trailheads, and long trips. Definitely worth the money."
5,Absolute Lifesaver for Potty Training!,"I cannot count the times this potty seat has saved my daughter from having accidents on the road! I absolutely love it's portability. We have taken it to theme parks, road trips, the beach, etc. I just leave it in the car for those times when we get stuck in traffic and then we just pull over and pop it out for her. This is not a luxury item, it is a must have for all parents with potty training toddlers!"
2,Sturdy but useless,"While I haven't tried this with Skype yet, it's integration with MS Lync is not at all good. The case seems sturdy, the switches switch. This seems like tech from a couple of generations back."
1,The Rose,"She is a very talented girl. She sounded great when I saw her on TV. I bought the CD because I was impressed with her voice, but I thought the CD was terrible. It was annoying to listen to because of the way it was recorded. It does not due her justice. I will never play it again."
3,Poor title for the movie,"My granddaughters, 2yrs. & 4 yrs., did not like this dvd as much as others. They love Strawberry Shortcake but kept waiting for the Glimmerberry Ball to begin. It was in the very last few minutes of the movie and only lasted for seconds. Because of the title, they expected to see a ball with girls in pretty dresses dancing around. It just seemed like a poor title for the movie."
5,Kids LOVE it!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter got this movie as a present and we have watched it about 20 times in the last week. I was skeptical about the new look of the characters at first but, I actually prefer watching the new characters now. My 4 year old son will even sit and watch it with us once in a while. Needless to say, my daughter absolutely LOVES this movie and I am hunting for more DVD's of the new Strawberry Shortcake to add a little variety since we have just about memorized these 3 episodes."
5,Great Movie,My girls and I saw this in the Theater and they fell in love with it. Can't wait to give it to them for Christmas.
4,cute,Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter she loves it and has watched it a few times. I;m sure it will be watch a few times more.
4,4year old addicted,"My four year old is addicted to this movie. The storyline is average, as is the animation."
5,Daughter loved it,Received in great condition. My 4 1/2 year old loves Strawberry shortcake and she loved this movie. A wonderful addition to our existing collections of Strawberry Shortcake.
1,these movies make me want to stomp some berries,So annoying and teaching my daughters how to be snobby and full of vanity. Ranks right up there with Barbie.
4,she like it .,she like it think you she as two other movies that santa gave her to look at also .love shylah
4,Beats the 1980's version,"Remember Strawberry Shortcake from the 80's with the giant head, sad hat, and terrible songs? Well she still has the big head but this modern version looks and sounds much better! Animation is pretty good, and it has a modern tone without snotty attitudes (ie the new My Little Pony). What I really like is it is one long story (about 90 min) but is broken up into segments that each stand alone. This makes it perfect for when I need a short distraction for my 2 year old, or when I need it for a long drive. My daughter loved her first Bright Lights Big Dreams so much I bought two more. My 4 year old son even likes it too!"
4,Good buy,"These earrings are very pretty; far better than I anticipated, considering the price. Definitely a good purchase."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is not geared at all toward the older runner except in the photos and in the title. Arthur Lydiard still thinks that the older runner needs to work up to a weekly mileage of 160km (100mi) a week to insure he or she is running fit. For the older runner and for that matter for most runners this is excessive. His schedules also advocate running every day. This also contradicts much of the advice given by other experts who advise at least one day of rest per week, especially for the older runner. I was also very disappointed in the photos. The photos depict an older runner doing various running drills. However, these drills are not described at all in the text. As a matter of fact it seems that for the most part the photos bear little relation to the text they are embedded in.My bottom line recommendation is to forget this book. There are much better books on the market for the Master runner that provide a lot more useful information."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I like a story to start more slowly and allow time for character development. This is not that kind of book. It's more a Wham Bam, Oops, I'm Already Through, kind of book. There was also a lot of focus on pill-popping (prescription), which got old quickly and didn't serve to advance the storyline at all. Maybe this is someone else's cup of tea; it's not mine. I passed this book on to my sister, and she shared my opinion."
3,I had a problem with the wick fitting my lanterns,"The product arrived quickly and was as described in the ad submitted by the seller. Unfortunately the wicks didn't really fir my lanterns and were very difficult to install. I view this as my issue. Perhaps the product description could be updated to beter describe the wick thickness. Widith was fine but they were a bit thick for my lanterns. That said, I would still recommend this seller's product for the right lanterns."
5,Nothing bad to say about these wicks,"They are lamp wicks, they work just fine, no complaints! Not always easy to find, so a good purchase all in all."
1,An abomination,"It was just a matter of time before the sharks came out to infest the DVD world with inferior ""product"" like they did a couple of decades back with VHS. There's a new rule in my house: if the name Platinum Disc Corporation is on the box, avoid purchasing the same way you avoid disease. No care has been taken to obtain good prints, the visuals are murky and the sound choppy, the constant corner bug to let you know what miserable company is responsible for the mess (PIP...what does that stand for? shouldn't it be PDC? Did they change their name? After their latest batch of releases, an even newer name change should be in order, if they are to ever get any one to buy their junk releases.)Don't let the bright, attractive packaging fool you. Buyer beware! And by all means, film buffs beware!"
2,Service,"I ordered two different sets of the Blondie movies and received tow of the same sets of movies, despite the fact the invoice listed the correct order. It's frustrating because now I have to send the product back and wait for the right set to come in the mail. What ever happened to double checking your work!"
3,condensed Blondie,"Say what you will about the dupe quality, superimposed ID logo, etc. but these are NOT the original Blondie films as seen in theatres.In reality, these are butchered versions from a mid-Sixties syndication package, apparently edited down to fit into one-hour TV time slots. The original Columbia Pictures titles have been deleted and replaced with an idiotic jingle and credits, plots seem to pick up in mid-scene several minutes after the original film actually began, and in several cases, key sequences appear to have been excised, resulting in baffling continuity gaps.That said, Platinum packaging identifies these condensations as ""episodes,"" not movies--and the company is merely re-releasing an abomination, not committing one. And, c'mon, what do you expect for $6?Even in this chopped-up form, this rarely-seen series is still a lot of fun. The antics of Baby Dumpling, the dog and the neighbor kid are worth the price alone."
3,An OK Collection,"First, you'll get a glimpse of some actors who went on to become A-Movie actors. The sampling of movies are only OK because there are better examples of this collection than could have been used."
4,"Blondie, Sets 1 and 2 by Penny Singleton, Arthur Lake",Just like I remember as a kid watching the old re-runs on saturday afternoon TV. This is good for the whole family to watch. Funny and enjoyable for the old folks to remember the time they saw it in the theater and even for the kids seeing it for the first time. Good humor that has wit and quick comebacks without being mean to each other.
4,Funny Classic,"Blondie, Dagwood and Baby Dumpling deliver hours of slapstick family friendly entertainment. Even your young children will enjoy this one."
4,good set,"not a bad set. quality is OK. contains 10 episodes and each episode starts off with a preview which is nice. looking for the day when the remaining 18 episodes will be available and the quality even better. but if quality isn't improved, would still purchase."
5,Beautiful,This CD is one of Shirley Caesar's best. I absolutly love the song Faded Rose. Her voice just calms my nerves and helps to let go of whatever bad thing is happening to me.
2,Great Expectations Unfulfilled,"I loved the premise: Harvey Girl + Pinkerton Agent + New Mexico = Fun in the Sun. This book starts strongly. Ana Leigh can write.But from the second third to the end, it meanders from location to location. Frankly, I kept reading only because I thought the writer would find her way again. Then I started paging through very quickly, especially during the outlaw action.One more thing: I nominate the skinny dipping scene for the Most Gratuitous Sex Scene in a Romance Novel."
4,Great,"Excellent quality and turnaround time, received when promised. The games are fun, and not immature for adults!"
4,Good Stuff,"As a social worker, it is good to have many ideas at hand for groups and trainings. A lot of the ideas can easily be modified to meet your needs."
1,Terrible!,"This book sucks! I literally was not able to find one clever, effective or original activity in the entire thing. Not one. Write down a story about yourself or a provocative question you want to ask your co-worker, and then ask it of them? Really? If it wasn't going to cost me more to send it back that it is worth, I would."
2,not worth buying,This book is not comprehensible and boring. I don't know what to do with it's content.
2,Simplistic,"OK but kind of simplistic. I used an item in an MBA class, but I had to add a lot of content to make it interesting."
1,Borrrrrriinnnnnngg!,"This book might be appropriate for a grammar school teacher (maybe). Application to contemporary business environment, NOT. Save your money (and time)."
1,Terrible,"I ordered this book along with Alanna Jones ""Team Building for Every Group"" and this book is horrible. The Jones book is outstanding.This book is very difficult to follow, it doesnt flow very well and the activities are very weak. It is geared more towards office stuff, but you couldnt even use it for office stuff since the games are very difficult to manage and obvious. I think they are more concerned with The Questions they ask than the activity. These games are some that I could think of on my own... I am returning the book."
2,A few nuggets,"I ordered this one with Brian Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activities for busy Managers (which is excellent). I was disappointed by this one. So many of the activities were overly simplistic. Several werent what I would even call activities, but rather ""facilitated discussions."" I only found a few worth trying. I rely on the other book much more."
4,From a review in the Shambhala Sun magazine:,"If you haven't heard of Ko Un, take note. This Korean poet is a former Buddhist monk and a two-time Nobel Prize-nominee for literature. The fall book season sees the release of two English translations of his work, a novel and a collection of poetry (Ten Thousand Lives from Green Integer). An accessible introduction to Ko Un, Little Pilgrim is a fictional tale based on the Avatamsaka or ""Flower Garland"" sutra, one of the most influential scriptures in East Asian Buddhism. It's the story of a young boy, Sudhana, who sets out on a journey and meets fifty-three teachers-Buddhist, spirit, and otherwise-who help him to become a bodhisattva. Ko Un has rendered it as an engaging narrative that will be a treasure for a young, modern audience, fulfilling a promise he made to his teacher more than thirty years ago."
4,I found the icons and directions extremely easy to follow.,"I believe that this book is an excellent resource for newbies like myself. I found it to be easy to read, with great icons and picture examples. As you grow in experience this book will allow you the expertise reach those applications that you want to attain. The book was written in a humourous may allowing for easy read."
3,A well written into to an obsolete computer,"This is an entertaining book that will help people learn to use their Mac. Unfortunately the author exhibits the kind of irrational, foaming at the mouth delusions that plagues so many Apple fanatics. I have to use both Macs and Win95/98/NT systems daily and frankly the Mac is JUNK."
1,very very small package,"the package containing the beads is about 1"" by 1"" MAYBE a little bigger it is VERY disappointing considering I payed $11 for PLASTIC BEADS"
3,"The ones that worked, worked well...",One third of the beads - the orange or yellow color judging from the package - don't seem to change color at all in sunlight. The other colors work well and are great for teaching kids about UV light.
4,want more of these beads for less money?...,the beads themselves are freakin cool but you dont get a lot of them. click this link and it'll bring you to a page where you can purchase 250 of them for like 7 bucks. anddd you can watch a nifty little video on them haha. its really cool. heres the link:[…]
3,100 beads is just not much,The picture accompanying the beads shows multiple bracelets on a child's arm. But one hundred beads is really barely enough for one small necklace.
5,New Believers Bible,"Easy to read and understand. Had many helpful sections that describe and explain things that would normally be hard to understand. Also has sections answering tough questions, as well as many applications of the Word to real life! Love this Bible!"
3,"Good quality, but one package only had 9 stickers (instead of 12 as advertised)","I was excited to use these for awards to my students. Luckily, I bought two packages since one of the packages only contained 3 sheets of 3 stickers/each instead of 4 sheets of 3 stickers/each. The second package contained 12 stickers as advertised."
1,Where was the editor?,"Mile-long paragraphs, mind-numbing descriptions, sparse, irritating dialogue, endless run-on sentences and apathetic, near-comatose characters made this book an impossible read. Not even the dogs were engaging. The only horrifying thing about this book is that I can't return it and get my money back."
3,worth a second read,"although, I will agree the work leaves the reader without a definitive expression of the author's intent, I must disagree that it is unworthy of reading. Not a typical horror story, with obvious villians and heroes, this book is filled with haunting passages that will stick with me for some time."
1,"bad, confusing","I like to give all books a chance, I read a lot, but this is the worst book I read. I read the whole thing, when I was done I went online to see if anyone could help me out with what this was about, but I see everyone was just a confused as me. It was like a bad confusing dream."
1,AND THIS AUTHOR WON AN AWARD FOR HIS 1ST BOOK?,"I agree with every negative review of this book. (And I have no intention of reading ""Ordinary Horror"", to see why Mr. Searcy won the International Horror Guild Award for best first novel! That would be throwing good money after bad.)I struggled for more than a month to finish ""Last Things"". In fact, I was afraid it might very well be the last thing I ever did. (Terrible pun, I know.) Searcy's prose, perhaps, belongs in poems.....SHORT poems.One reviewer refers to the ""heroic quartet""? I'm sorry (no, I'm not). The only character I found of even remote interest (the woman who regularly raked her dirt) came and went, within the story, in lurches. Sort of like someone trying to learn how to drive a standard.This reviewer wishes she had read some reviews before purchasing this book. For anyone out there thinking of doing the same, DON'T! Get yourself a copy of ""Retribution"" by Jilliane Hoffman instead!"
1,Stunning and not in a good way,"So it wasn't just me being impatient or dense. Many of you didn't sense the boding horror behind those cheese sandwiches or the pointless dialogue. I'm not the only person who came away from this going ""huh?"" I still don't know what the heck that peg board trap was supposed to do. This was, at best, a (very) short story allowed to spin endlessly out of control. And whoever compared it to Flannery O'Connor on the dust jacket should be forced to listen to an audio version over and over and over."
1,"Last things, should read last book","I have read a lot of bad books, but this is the worst. More then half the book is about Luther doing day to day tasks. Luther feeds the chickens, Luther makes a sandwich, Luther plays with the dogs, and Luther goes to Wal-mart. One bit of advice I would like to give Mr. Searcy. If he is going to write a book at least have a story to tell, it makes it so much more interesting for the reader."
3,I kept expecting Barbara Windsor to pop up in Bert and Maggies cafe!,"Rosie was an intelligent little seven year old and seeing the world through her eyes was clever because we, as adults, can see more into things than she can, which made her observations amusing.I felt I was living in 1950's Soho whilst reading this and what a warm and friendly place it appeared to be. Yes, the people in her world were wide boys, rough diamonds and even prostitutes but the characters were totally believable and you felt absolutely safe with them. The sense of community was the overall theme and how they always cared for their own, especially Rosie. I almost wanted to boo the baddies when they made their appearance.A warm and amusing story but a book that needs to be read in large chunks and not a page or two before bed."
2,"Disappointing, but a brave effort","I really wanted to like this book. Its author is cheerful and well informed, and the subject is an important one. However, while the book has a promising beginning, it falls apart quickly - droning on like a university term paper in an alphabet soup about MZ, MZT, MZA, MPQ, LZT, MISTRA etc. (none of these acronyms are in the index)Then full chapters are dedicated to bragging about his wonderful, well adjusted sons who received full scholarships to important universities and how wonderful various other members of his family are. He sounds happy - but I was much more interested in finding out how I could be more happy in my own life and helping others acheive the same. On this effort, he offers very little advice, ranging from a beer bread recipe to rambling on about making sure people are licensed before they can have children. This book would make an interesting, short pamphlet - but as a book it is deeply flawed."
2,A great psychologist...but a disappointing book,"David Lykken is a superbly intellectual psychologist and I was hoping this book would reflect the power of that intellect, but this book ultimately collapses into some home spun family tales and ""common sense"" notions of happiness that may just be wrong. A real disappointment"
5,Nothing less than great,Very impressed with the quality. The episodes look as though they were just shot yeasterday when it comes to sound and clarity. Hopefully all 12 seasons will be put out. If you are a Hawaii 5O fan you won't be disappointed!
4,Solid stories. We need more Steve McGarretts today!,This was back when you could still tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. A really good collection.
5,All fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine,All fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine.This takes too much time.
2,Defective disks in this edition!,"This is the SECOND set of ""The Fourth Season"" I received after returning the first set because certain tracks wouldn't play on my DVD player. And I'm having the same problem again with the same tracks! Same problem occurs on all my DVD players. If I hit fast forward on the tracks that won't load, then I can rewind to the beginning, but that's a real pain. Obviously a defect in the manufacturing of this set."
5,Hawaii Five-O fourth season,"I loved this show from the beginning. It was filmed in Hawaii which brought many tourists here - and Jack Lord was perfect for the part of Steve McGarrett. I don't know how many seasons it ran, but I hope to own all of them."
1,Boot Leg Videos,"Consumers, beware of bootlegged copies of video's being sold as originals. I recieved a ""copy"" not an original of Hawaii 5-0 4th season in original packaging but with a copy dvd. This is unacceptable and I had to contact the manufacturer to confirm that the dvd itself should match the outside cover graphics. Mine was simply a grey cd with the words Hawaii 5-0 inscribed on it. Not what I paid for and never again will I purchase anything from that seller as they either dont know they are re-selling fakes or they just dont care."
3,OKAY.....,"This Hawaii Five-O edition was just ""okay"" it seemed a little slow and choppy, but I can't remember if it was just this season, or if the series was getting slow an choppy at this point? I give it an ""okay"" but it did make me wonder if I wanted to keep collecting this series?"
2,HAWAII FIVE O the fourth season,"I can say that the quality of this product is very good, But for me, I'm french lady, In my country the américans DVD can't be reed by our dvd reeder. the zone is different and I Have to incode all the collection with my computer to be able to watch them in AVI film.That's a problem for me.I wait for the fifth season to by this in France.It's damadge because in France the price is more hight.excuse me for my bad english.Hawaii Five-O - The Fourth Season"
5,When is season 5?,Hawaii Five O is one of the best dramas in television history. The writing is outstanding. Can't wait until season 5.
3,Ok,"This movie was far from what I've expected. First and last stories are barely interesting at all. It was a very theatrical experience, with overdone performances and stage-like lighting. Most interesting piece to me was the story of the earless."
2,only okey dokey..maybe.,"this film is 4 stories of japanese folklore told back to back and is filmed the just like the stories are read...that isn't always a good thing...the sets and the atmosphere are Awesome! Beautiful! But...It was super duper slow...there are not so much to the stories for them to be taking 30 minutes each...adding to the boredom, there is hardly any dialogue, just lots of cold stares from the actors...I own a couple of Japanese folklore books and the stories usually wont even last a whole page...the stories are very quick and very to the point....but the short films are not that great but very pretty...I wish these kind of sets were on more films....anyways...I regret spending this much money on the film..."
2,Ugetsu it isn't,"All of the story lines are too predictable and overdone if not over""acted""...this is far off from the Japanese classic, Ugetsu. The beauty of the cinematography in this movie is symbolic and spirited, sometimes surreal, but cannot compare to that of the past masters."
2,"Ok, I always get sucked into these ghost stories","Lesson 1, always look at the date of the movie and then read the premise. I always read the premise, get the movie and then once it's in, realize that it's more of a Sinbad Saturday Afternoon movie then the Sixth Sense. The last story was cool about the boy who is on the cover but the rest are boring.Rent-MaybeBuy-No"
5,Amazing!!!,"This collection of stories is a mysterious journey into the folklore of Japan. The emphasis, though in a visual format, seems to be the ancient oral traditions of myth from a society that remained relatively unchanged for hundreds of years. The cinematography is compelling, and the stories are scarey as hell.If you like scarey movies and have a passion for the culture and traditions of Japan, get this movie. If you are expecting ninjas or gunplay, this is not the movie for you"
5,unforgettable,Superb Japanese anthology film.Ravishing photography and incredibly beautiful sets make this a visual treat.Director Masaki Kobayashi does a wonderful job with the Lafcadio Hearn ghost stories instilling each with its own haunting quality.A must buy disc.
3,Truncated version!,"Nobody seems to have mentioned it here, but this Criterion edition is the 'international' version. at 160 minutes (Amazon has listed the wrong running time as usual) it is missing a staggering 22 minutes of footage. The original Japanese version can be found if you do the research. The Region 2 dvd from ""Masters of Cinema"" is the full-length version, and it is even a better transfer! When buying films like this I always do my research, as many Asian films have shorter versions for international films. Very disappointed in Criterion; they are usually great, but they really dropped the ball for this title."
4,Obscure 70's Music by Australian Artists,"This is album is a real find. Ironically, I had to source it from the USA even though it is a collection of Australian artists, manufactured in Sydney and I live here in Australia. Go figure!! Some of these tunes you really would not want to hear again but the majority are real gems.With Other Fabulous Australian Performers of the Seventies"
2,good keyring,I put this on my keyring - definitely makes it unique. It's not very useful for removing ticks on a Corgi though - plain old tweezers beat it by far.
5,Great product,"I have used this once on my cat since I received the Tick Key in the mail. She didn't try to run away when my husband and I removed the tick. When tweasers were used, she wouldn't go near us for three days."
4,Glad to have it,"I got bitten by 3 ticks while camping last spring in North Carolina and my camp mates, between them, got 6 more. I will throw this in with my camping gear from now on...hope I don't have to use it, but the design looks like it will do the trick."
2,Not effective,"I've only tried to use this a few times so far but it's proving to be less than straightforward to use. Our dog has long hair (border collie) which doesn't help, but there are two problems with using this item - 1. When placing the key around the tick, the tick tends to be pushed sideways making getting a good grip difficult. This has happened each time that I've tried to use it. 2. For the one tick that I did manage to remove using this device, since there's no way of holding onto it once it's removed, the tick then fell back onto the dog, getting lost in the long hair. I'll try a few more times, but so far I've had to revert back to using tweezers to remove the ticks."
4,Good to Go,"Good to go, especially if you go hiking as often as we do. Being that I am taking my dogs in to the wood with frequecy I wanted to get something to take off the ticks when a flick of the finger wouldn't do it. And as long as you have your keys your in business. No packing extra stuff or having to wait until you get back to the car.I have used it, and I was impressed to see just how well it worked. The only draw back is if the ticks are teenie tiny. Then you still have to reach for the tweezers and hope to remove the bugger, head and all."
5,GREAT product,"I HIGHLY recommend this product! I ordered this on a whim (to get a pet supply order over $50 for free shipping!) and it wound up being worth every penny. I am completely squeamish when it comes to bugs or blood...and a full tick is a horrible combination of both! Last time my dog had a tick, I took her to the vet and had to shell out big bucks to have it removed. This time at 9 PM, I had no other choice than to try my new Tick Key...it worked awesome! Tick came right off, and I did NOT have to touch it! So glad I ordered it!"
4,"Solid, good #2 book","This is the third ""how to get a job in pharma sales"" book that I'm reading. Both ""Insight into a Career in Pharmaceutical Sales"" and ""nsiders Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales"" provide more comprehensive treatments of the actual tactics for getting a job in the industry. However, Mr. Melfa provides tactical information for actually succeeding as a pharma rep once you've landed a position, and this information is not included in either of the either two texts. This book is an excellent companion to pair with either of those two. I give Mr. Melfa credit, though, for actually responding to my email. Thanks, Frank!"
1,Heard It Before,"Unfortunately this is another book contains the same information as all the past written books on pharmaceutical sales. It seems mr. Melfa spends most of the time ""tooting his horn"" then focusing on the subject at hand...selling pharmaceuticals. I would save your money."
2,Fails to live up to the hype!,"This book does not deliver based on the description given of the contents. It does not supply comprehensive or even adequate information on gaining a pharmaceutical sales position or excelling at the position as advertised. This very small, thin book is a disappointment to the reader. The limited information from one ""current district manager"" from an un-named ""world-class"" pharmaceutical company pales in comparison to several pharmaceutical sales interview books which are currently available for the pharmaceutical sales job seeker. I definitely don't recommend it."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,This book reflects reality in job seeking and actual employment! I always like straight forward information.
5,An Angel for May,A wonderful family movie set in the present and in World War II England. This is a heart touching movie that my wife and I love and I think you will too. I purchased this movie on a Amazon movie recommendation for me and with Amazon I also was able to purchase it at a great price.Gary
4,good film for family,"A jump in the past and Tom finds himself on the time of the second world war, he finds a dog named Tess and then becomes friend with an youg girl avacuee, May... Very good story,to see with all family....a film about friendship."
5,Wish they made more like this.,I saw about 5 min of this movie at an RV show and the whole family said we had to get it. When it arrived we hoped it was as good as we had thought. We were not disappointed. It was the best movie/DVD we have seen in a long time. It was one of the few movies that I have watched where I did not want to get up and miss something. The movie people really need to make more movies like this. Better than anything coming out this summer.
1,Lack of depth,"This book could have been summed up in two pages. There was nothing new or insightful in this book. If you need someone to tell you that to be an effective coach you have to communicate, give feedback, dont leave negative emails, etc. then this book is for you. If you are looking for something more, save your money."
3,Cheaply made,"It looked wonderful, but it was just cardboard with a plastic cover. Did not hold up. I bought it for my granddaughter in another city, so I don't know how it is now."
4,Interesting and hard to watch.,"As a huge Beatles fan, it was hard to watch this documentary and interview stuff. At the same time, I enjoy knowing how regretful he is and how depressing his life is now-deservedly so. There a 2 DVD's with some interesting interviews from various people involved at the time, etc.As someone who will never forget that day, it is never the less a fascinating reminder of what happened and why."
2,wasted opportunity,"a great idea these headphones seeing as the headphones that came with my 6230 (HDS3) fall out of my ears every 10 seconds and you have to hold the microphone close to your mouth...So these headphones solve that problem with a great design, clips over the ears to hold them in place, brilliant clip-on mic/control pad that can go on your collar, nice rugged plastic.However this is all wasted when you plug in... the sound on these headphones is awful, no bass, no sound balance, no subtlety: just blaring all the horrible tinny mids so it sounds like a 50p set of headphones from a christmas cracker. Should have stuck with the other ones which fell out the ears, at least they sound good...Pointless."
4,Great headset,I like this product. The headset is comfortable to wear and the sound quality is good the cost.
5,A SPECTACULAR STORY,"When it comes to fantasy, Mr. Godfrey in my opinion is one of the best. His lastest novel ""Ledgend's Prophecy"" is miles aheadof the competition. The story moves swiftly and gracefully through each captivating chapter. His characters are firmlybelievable with the storyline, and the action, well, you've gotto read it to experience the ""rush"" for yourself. The clamaticclash between the evil sorcerer and the all-powerful wizard willleave you breatheless! I highly recommend this book."
5,fantasy with niceness,"With all the publicity about fantasy books lately, Ledgend's Prophecy is right in style. What I discovered about this book is that it not only features wizards, magic belts, spells, sorcery and traditional fantasy elements: it dishes up some big scoops of ""niceness."" Take for example some of the characters names: Faith, Hope, and Charity. It is almost as if the author is blending in biblical themes with the expected offerings of the fantasy genre. And the story has its share of evil bad characters, which helps to give a good contrast between the ""niceness"" of the good characters and the ""badness"" of the creepy characters: makes for just the right amount of conflict and resolution to stimulate and satisfy the reader. It is also easy to read and understand. Good story, author Tyrone Godfrey!"
4,"USB Fine, Firewire not so much...","I have used this product for a while and tried in many computers. It always works when connected to USB ports, and if they are USB 2.0 it is pretty fast. On the other hand, firewire ports are a pain in the... sometimes they work, sometimes they don't without any possible solution at sight."
3,Not you're typical carpenter,"This made for TV movie is just that, a made for TV movie . You won't find any carpenter music style in this or the intensity that most of John carpenters movie have . It's an ok film . It was filmed before the iconic halloween right after assault on precinct 13 . If you are a John carpenter fan like myself then check this out but like I said ... Made for TV movie."
3,Creepy and Watchable,"This made for t.v. film from '78 is suspenful and well done. The acting, directing, and story are top notch. It is, in my opinion, way better than ""Dark Night Of The Scarecrow"" an overrated t.v. movie from '81. It holds up well and is one of John Carpenter's best. He did this film right before ""Halloween""."
3,Predictable but worth seeing,"I ordered this film since I had memories of it making me really scared in the early eighties. Obviously, today I see it with different eyes. I can see that Lauren Hutton's acting skills are not what gave her the part and I can see that the movie is predictable and in parts quite unrealistic. That being said, I'm glad I took this trip down memory lane and I had some fun watching."
3,It's ok as a TV movie,"No es la típica película de John Carpenter, se nota que se le contrató para hacerla, pero a pesar de ello el suspenso nos mantiene atentos a todo momento, por lo que cumple su cometido, pero no con creces."
4,Exactly as it should be!,This mount is works exactly as it should. All the parts you would expect are included and it arrived FAST! I am very pleased with this purchase.
3,Not quite as pictured...,"The design of the mount is slightly different that what is displayed above, the result of which is that the line-in plugs on the XM MiFi no longer fit when the MiFi is on the mount. We had to file down the mount, which kind of defeats the purpose of this model purchase. It was disappointing to say the least."
4,good product,This product does what I needed. It does have a little vibration because of the length but I can live with it.
4,Excellent mount for satellite radios,"This product is just what I was looking for to mount my XM radio in my Sebring Convertible. Because of it's deep windshield, this unit is great for any of Chrysler's ""cab foward design"" cars. Only the extreme tight fit for the radio slot prevented this from being 5 stars, but this is easily remedied."
3,Does not work with my Sirius!!!!!!!!!,The universal plate could not work with my unit the XTR7CK and besides it has adhesive backing. I did take the xm bracket and use 4 nuts to attach to the akrons screws; and after 1 hour of fiddling i jerry rigged something that should work out of the box. the unit itself is very strong and would recommend it with 5 stars if they would include directions and appropriate hardware
1,What a total piece of crap!!!!,Received product and everything was fine until I opened the package. The side of the unit that connects to the radio lasted about five minutes before it cracked and then broke. Unit was garbage at that point since it would cost as much to send it back as I spent to buy the product. What a waste of money. I will never buy Akron products if this is the best they can do.
2,"Great idea and design, poor quality.","This was exactly what I needed. It is very adjustable, and feels solid and well made. The suction cup also holds very firm on the glass, a big plus since most window-mount devices like this constantly fall off. Unfortunately, after about a month, the adapter broke off, right behind the plate at the swivel. I was adjusting the swivel, while it was attached to the window, so there is no way that I put that much pressure on it, but it just snapped off in my hand. I looked at it pretty closely, and I couldn't see any defects that could have contributed to it breaking, it must be just the poor quality of the plastic or molding process.Were it not for the seemingly poor quality, this mount would have easily gotten 4 or 5 stars from me. Great design, but it's just not up to the quality of previous Arkon mounts I have owned. The only way it gets 2 stars from me is that I was able to patch it with Gorilla Glue and it is still functional. Gorilla Glue gets 5 stars."
5,easy and practical,"This is the best solution I've found to mount something without adhesives or drilling. The suction cup and arm are very sturdy, and easy to move if needed.Really can't beat it for the price."
5,Long Enough for Sharply Angled Windshields,Very good design. Suction cup is very strong and easy to suction. Long enough for angled windshields (I have a Honda Fit which has a really angled windshield). Clips right in with no problems. Only issue is the wires from the module extend up to wherever the device is mounted (to be expected when you mount to your windshield) so I didn't take off any stars for that.
4,A must have for fans of Tricky,"Not really much to say here - this dvd contains all his music videos (his latest albums not included obviously). Famous tracks such as ""overcome"" ""poems"" ""christiansands"" are included. I can do without the documentary, but it was interesting him going through his old town and talking about it."
4,Clear and concise introduction to Dreamweaver 8,"I decided to try my first Dreamweaver site today. Thankfully I had this book on my desk.So, when I tried to create a template, I found the information that I needed right away in this book.I appreciate the tips and suggestions. The layout is great and easy to read, not overwhelming as I have found many other books to be. Efficient use of graphics as well."
2,I'm lost with this book,"This book is not totally disappointing. It has some good sides. However, my overall experience is not very positive. You get the impression this book targets about 1 percent of DW users, the heavy-duty coders. If you are like me, more design-oriented and interested in Flash, web images and other stuff, you'll be lost with this book."
2,Confusing for the Novice,"While I have a background in graphics programs, I'm entirely new to Dreamweaver. This book looked like it would be a sole resource. It wasn't. Too often terms are mentioned without definitions (a glossary would be a help). More than once a process was described without a basic first step that would seem obvious to experienced users, but only confused novice users. I wound up having to use other resources to make sense of this book. I wouldn't recommend it to first timers like myself."
1,Not for novices,"I am very computer savy. I have used Photoshop, Freehand, Illustrator, and In Design almost from the get go, yet, I have been very frustrated in trying to get web pages up and going by following this book and toying with Dreamweaver on my own. Very frustrating!"
2,Not intended for the web design novice,"I am completely new to web design and found this book extremely overwhelming. The series title, ""Visual Quickstart Guide"", appears to be aimed towards beginners such as myself, however it is probably aimed at people with experience with older versions of Dreamweaver looking to upgrade their knowledge. There is so much talk about the old dreamweaver, new ways of doing things etc. and I'm not really interested in that. Other clues that this book is not designed for a beginner is the lack of glossary (mentioned in another review) and the amount of space devoted to setting one's preferences of Dreamweaver. As a novice, how am I supposed to know what I prefer when I don't even know where to begin?"
3,I have read better DW8 manual,"I am learning DW8 from the very 0. I can't judge ""objectively"" but ""Dramweaver 8 the Missing Manual"" for me reads easier. English is my second language and maybe here is an explanation, or maybe Negrino's and Smith's book is for more advanced people then I am."
2,What a mess!,"If you have learned the first steps in web design with the superb didactic Dreamweaver books from J. Tarin Towers, you will find this this one from Tom Negrino and Dori Smith very confuse for everyone who wants to to learn or update his(her) knowledges about CSS Layout.For Example, the authors wrote:""...Dreamweaver's layers are in nearly the same shape as that of the HTML 'layer' tag: obsolet, and not for use going forward.""... Or ...""If you have a site that use layers, it's woth taking the time to carefully convert it to use block positioning layout, divs, and CSS...""Macromedia TechNotes for Dreamweaver 8 pointed out:""...Dreamweaver treats all div tags with absolute position as layers, even if you didn`t create those div tags using layers drawing tools...""And much better:""...When you draw a layer using the drawing tools, Dreamweaver inserts a div tag in the document and assings the layer ID value...""I think this book needs a revisionRegardsManuel. Vienna"
1,never arrived,I ordered this product but it never was delivered even though amazon tracking info said it did. I eventually got my money back after waiting for 2 weeks.
1,Disappointing,"Spenco products for many years were my favorite orthotics. However since manufacturing shifted from USA to China, quality has seriously declined (this is not the first China-made Spenco I have returned). The right/left orthotics did not match each other and exhibited an offensive ""chemical"" odor. I will no longer buy products from Spenco !!"
3,Just ok,The product does give adequate arch support but overall the insert is narrow and slides around. You have to always adjust it before putting your foot in the show to make sure its all the way to the back of the shoe. I just wish it fit a lil more snug like the Dr. Sholes that I have (which don't provide as much arch support as these).
2,Spenco arch cushions,"These are OK. I had ordered the Spenco Arch supports with the solid bottoms for my feet and recieved these instead. I gave them a try; they help a little, but if I'mm on my feet more than 2 - 3 hours my feet hurt anyway. I don't recommend these for really busy people or professionals on their feet for extended periods of time."
3,maybe it is my foot,"The arch placement seems too high up on the foot pad, too close to the heal, at least for my foot thereby rendering this product marginal and somewhat painful."
5,Highly recommended,I have a high arch and these inserts were recommended by my orthopedic surgeon. Have used for years. Are in every pair of shoes I own.
2,Not for dressy shoes,"The arch support was solid, but these cushions were too thick to wear comfortably with dressy flats. Maybe they work better with athletic shoes?"
3,They tend to shift in your shoe,"They have great support, but do tend to shift in your shoe. Probably only best when when full length simply won't work."
1,Does not work,I have high arches and am constantly having buy arch supports because shoe makers not make shoes correctly? These not help if heels hurt! Not seem pad much ?
3,not very helpful for plantar fascitis,"I was not crazy about these. They were a good cushion, if you just want that. This was not eveyr helpful for me."
2,Meh,"Somewhat supportive, but compresses very easily. I was hoping they would be a bit more substantial. I will look for other more solid arch support inserts."
3,not as great as the ones I bought several years ago,I have used this same number cushion for several years.This new version is not as sturdy as the original ones I have.The arch seems not to give as much support.
5,cushion insoles,Insoles were an improvement. no longer do I have pain in my right achilles tendon and at last I can do my powerwalk as much as I want.thanks again!
3,Not for me.,My orthopedist told me to start wearing inserts in my shoes to support my arches. Of four different types I have tried these were the poorest fit. The arch support feels like I have a large rock under my arch and they move around even in my athletic shoes. I have the correct size and have tried them in a variety of shoes but it is still the same result. On the other hand I just purchased the new Dr. Scholls customize inserts and they are wonderful!
4,Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?,"A very nice intro to the sounds of New Orleans, a mixture of styles and genres,for these things one can always say - it could have been better, but I'm primarily a jazz fan, so you can guess that I have a special relationship to the music of New Orleans. Maybe Louis Armstron and Louis Prima are not very well represented, maybe Sidney Bechet or Wynton Marsalis could also have been there, etc., etc.But this is a very NICE jazz, jazzy, blues, bluesy, gumbo soul (etc.) compilation album.My favorite track is maybe the collaboration between Nicholas Payton (in his 20s) and Doc Cheatham (around 90, I believe)..."
5,First class Jazz!!,"Although it is a jazz class of it's own, (New Orleans only), it is the best compilation ever!!! The selections are upbeat, lively and extremely professional. Loved every bit of it!"
2,Mouse won't connect,"The keyboard and mouse worked for a while, but then it lost the mouse. Efforts to re-connect proved fruitless (tried the recommended methods as well as switching batteries, ports, computers). Nothing would re-establish the wireless link. It only lasted a couple of weeks."
2,some missed typng,"The keyboard sometimes misses, I believe because of signal interruption. This is a real hassle, It is nt from lack of keypad pressure on my part. I also agree that the extra buttons don't work and the software was no help. It really stinks."
1,It's junk,"Doesn't work right... It takes forever to get it to connect to the receiver, then when it finally connects, half the keys don't work. I'm not talking about the extra function keys, half the alphabetical keys don't work. S, B, T most of them don't work. Waste of money."
2,Well at least it works as a normal keyboard now.,"I am a Windows user and concur with other bad reviews on this product. I have had similar problems. Most of the extra keyboard functions do nothing. I have had problems with my mouse that the click would work but the mouse movement would not. Ever since installing the product my OS takes 10 - 15 seconds longer to boot-up. To get everything working to an acceptable state I have had to do a lot of re-installing and tweaking. Currently I have everything setup so that it works fine minus all the extra key functionality (bummer). Maybe if I tried a little harder I could get the extra keys working, but its not worth putting more time into it--it does what I need it to do. FYI I am a Software Engineer with a CS degree and I found this difficult to impossible to get working as it should. Kensington!!! You need a patch for this. ...and... It better not break mouse functionality again!!!!"
5,Reliable and quick performer,"Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase.Also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar."
5,Works great for me!,"After going through the reviews, I bought this CF card for my Canon Digital Rebel. So far it has worked fine, though I don't pretend to be an expert digital photographer. When the card is empty, it shows 127 shots available. It seems to read reasonably fast, though it takes a bit longer than I was used to with my point-and-shoot Olympus and its SmartMedia card."
4,Squirrel Wars: Not Just Squirrels,"The book says Squirrel Wars but it's a book about keeping other creatures out of your yard/garden as well. I was hoping it would be more comprehensive but since it gives tips on other creatures, I thought it had more value. Haven't gotten thru the whole book yet...too busy trying to salvage the bulbs that survived the squirrel attacks."
1,Watch out for yourself by skipping this loser,"The Gershwin estate should sue this ""author"" for defamation of character. Judi McMahon's idea of creative writing is to include a direct object in a sentence, which seems to tax her creativity to the max, hence she doesn't try it very often. Actually even getting a subject and verb in the same sentence seems to be beyond her most of the time. A truly abysmal piece of tripe that will at least start a good fire at so many pages, but one weeps for the dwindling forests that were sacrificed so needlessly."
1,Truly horrid,"This attempt at a ""novelized memoir"" (I kid you not) packs more cliches into each sentence than can truly be believed. The stories of three women--complete stereotypes meant to be instantly identified by their different religions (I kid you not)--manages to trivialize and marginalize everything real women have experienced for the past 50 years. The author's completely inept writing style (""style"" here is a relative term) actually will provoke laughter after a while--but at 400+ pages, it's too long a while to have to wait."
1,For those who consider Jackie Collins literature,"Ever get stuck in a swamp and spend days trudging through muck praying to get out? Then you've already experienced something akin to reading this book. The author's megalomania is surpassed only by her inability to write a comprehensible sentence. Evidently Judi McMahon, who claims these are her novelized memoirs (whatever that means), believes she was at the center of the universe for the past half century, knowing everyone who was anyone intimately, and affecting cosmic decisions on a daily basis at a level usually reserved for a minor deity. What a joke. One good thing--this hefty lump of pulp makes a formidable doorstop."
1,Someone should watch over this author--with an eraser,"Another abominable effort from this ""author"" (I use the term beyond loosely) who just barely manages to get a subject and verb in the same sentence. How this loser ever got published is the real mystery. The Gershwin estate ought to sue for defamation of character."
2,learn to dance for hip-hop,"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO UNTIL YOU HAVE HAD AN OPPROTUNITY VIEW IT FIRST!! the learn to dance content of this video is only 13 MINUTES long. the tape is about 18 minutes long after you subtract the announcemnets, OR 21 MINUTES with the announcements. It is too much to pay for this short tape.the five dancers are very stiff and dance together standing straight up like soldiers without any FLAVOR or ATTITUDE in their movements!if i saw the President and First Lady dance this way, i would say:""cool"". but for anyone else, forget it.i purchased six hip hop videos at the same time. this is the one that i would NOT purchase again. leon END"
1,TERRIBLE video,"I bought this video, among a few others, expecting to learn some dance moves. The video is awful, and not worth your money. It's a shame I opened it to find out. Next time I think it would be a good idea to read the reviews before making my purchase. READ this review. The video is lousy, outdated, and too short to waste your money on."
4,Paris,This is a more downtempo collection of house with inspiration coming from R&B and soul. It's still very soulful house though. The first disc was mixed by DJ Rork and the second by DJ Gilb'r. Not as good as Chicago and San Fransisco (which are awesome) but this one is still worth checking out.
2,Buy Chicago or San Francisco instead,I gave this CD at least three listens but just could not get into it. Both AD Chicago and San Francisco are hot and so if you are going to spend you money then buy those CD's instead.
1,Don't buy it!,"Save your money for another CD...or in this case, TWO CDs that BOTH unfortunately are not even worth the CDs they are burned on to!If you like ""Adore"" by I:Cube (the whole reason I wasted my money on this CD set), you can find that track on the ""Best of Hotel Costes"" along with quite a few other tunes that are just as creative and unique...Contrast this to ""Afterdark: Paris"" which is just plain boring and so NOT creative that you may just yank it out of your CD player before you get to the best track which is unfortunately at the END of the 2nd disc...The best liquid lounge compilation I have discovered thus far:""Sub Zero: The Essential Chill Out Collection""Pass on ""Afterdark: Paris"" and save your hard earned cash for ""Sub Zero"" instead...you will be a much happier camper!"
3,"Light is bright, but the hum is there..","The bulbs are bright, the light is good and not irritable, but as soon as I plug them in, they hum. It is a very low barely noticeable hum, but I can hear it and don't like it. I use another brand CFL which are absolutely noiseless and I love them but they are just a little more expensive. Back to them..:-)"
5,"Great light bulbs, long lasting.","I ordered my bulbs 1 1/2 years ago. They really last a long time. Great illumination, clean light.I am ordering more today."
1,Mis-advertised,This product was mis-advertised and categorized in the search results. Very poor customer service from vendor.
2,Jerry Springer Goes to Church,"I read this book because I am in a book club that read it. If I did not have to discuss it, I would not have finished it. The story was absolutely absurd! The molestation, incest, stealing are all too much for one book! The author would have done better with one or two tragedies, not one per chapter. I felt as if I were reading a cheap romance novel written by an extremely intelligent person."
2,Danielle Steele If She Were Pat Robertson,"This book was interesting, much the way night time soap operas are interesting: the events are so fantastic that you want to see what happens even though you don't give a damn about the characters. Ms. Cooper's tale reads like a miniseries on some christian TV station: all the good guys get rewarded and all the bad guys get punished - just like in real life, right??! She frequently lets us in on Satan's thoughts, and I know she knows that Satan is laughing about the lost time I wasted on this book. I'd have given it one star, but I did read the whole thing, and even if the devil made me do it, I figure that's worth an extra star."
4,Heart rending story I couldn't put down,"This was the kind of story that you love and hate at the same time. The characters experience made you laugh, made. You cry and made you mad all at the same time. The role of the devil was ingeniously intertwined along with the spider. I can't wait to read more from this author."
5,EXCELLENT,"This book was loaned to me by a friend, and I was initially a bit slow to 'get into it', but that did not last long. I found the storyline gripping, and the message reinforced what life is about: family and love, without the frills that so often distract us. I have recommended the book to other friends, and have now started to read more of Ms Cooper's writing."
5,great book!!!!,This was one of the best books I have ever read. I am a seventeen year old and was deeply delighted by this story. It truly has many different layers and each is unique and special. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical novels.
5,This book was mind blowing!,I have never in all my reading career read anything like this. This book was beyond exceptional. I could not seem to find a stoping point I could not put the book down. The author explained every character in detail and I actually had a visual picture of each character I felt as if I were there with them. I even like the way the spider had significance in the book. Good Job
4,Voted Best Book of 2003 ('Just Us Girls' Book Club),The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed this book in June '03. Overall the group felt that this book was very good!! The author did a good job in depicting how money does not ultimately bring total satisfaction! Each character portrayed selfish characteristics... there is a thin line of pleasing yourself before pleasing others. The metaphor of the black widow spider clearly depicted the character of Carlene. Hosanna made important decisions in New Orleans that impacted her family in Yorkville.Question - `who has greater power God or money?'
5,Couldn't Put It Down,The character development was excellent and the twists & turns of the novel were nothing less than brilliant.
4,An Enjoyable Story,"This was my first experience with J. California Cooper, and I can't believe what I've missed all this time. The story starts slowly, but it will soon capture your attention. Cooper does an excellent job of drawing you into the book's characters. Throughout the book, she focuses on the issues of greed, incest, and adultery, and finally, some of the characters start to experience ""true"" happiness and love. Read this - you'll enjoy it. -- Gayle"
5,Incredible! Really fell in love with the characters.,"This book was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is African-American (which I am not) and she said J. California Cooper was an incredible author. I bought the book that day and started it. I could not put it down! The characters were so rich and interesting. It gave me a new insight into post-Civil War days and struggles that the former slaves and their descendents lived through! Definatly a must read! Looking forward to reading ""The Wake of the Wind""---if I can ever get a copy!!!"
3,much better ms .cooper,I've read three of her books and this one is by far the best. I liked the characters but once again Ms. Cooper moves much too slow through her stories for me. She's a bit long winded of matters I see of no substance to the story. With that being said I did enjoy the book but not enough to read anymore of her writings.
3,very not bad,"I went on a Netflix L-Word marathon and then wanted some of the music from the show. Sad to say, the music is not too interesting -- at least not as much as it was when it accompanied the show."
3,Tracks are mislabelled,"The first track is presently labeled 'Organ Symphony No. 6, Op. 42, No. 2 - Finale'. This is actually a work for organ by the French composer Widor and doesn't appear on this disk at all.According to Fanfare magazine all six tracks on this album are by Bruns. His five movement Symphony No. 9 is actually tracks 1 to 5 on the disk. The tone poem called 'Aus dem Buch Hiob' appears as track 6 after the symphony."
3,"Good rules of thumb, thin on real investing info","A small book that is easy to read and is an okay starting place for beginners despite the fact that Bernstein conveniently makes a lot of recommendations for his own books. There's a little of everything, money management, what you should expect to make during your first years as an investor, a little technical analysis, some nice rules of thumb, etc. But this is also the book's weakness--it spreads itself thin covering a lot of topics in this short introductory book. For example, only elementary momentum analysis is explained and a beginning investor should have more information than that to start investing. There are better ""starter"" books and readers of No Bull Investing should be aware that they can pick up a lot of simple tips and rules from Bernstein, but should continue their education before diving into investing."
3,THIS IS NOT ALL-CENTURY!,"I Was Expecting big things from this book but came away disappointed with both the packaging and content of the book. The packaging because the pictures were nothing exciting and the order seemed out of sync,like they put this together quickly to meet some deadline.As for the content or selection,it baffled me that Roger Clemens was on this team.In big games,I'll go with Whitey Ford any day of the week.Apparently,the selection was based less on performance and leadership in clutch situations than on strikeouts and statistics.Also,people who picked this team have short memories and attention spans because when you look at the whole century instead of the 80s and 90s,you will find much better pitchers than Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens who despite the many strikeouts and good stats,never led their teams like a Ford,Koufax,or Gibson.These guys knew how to win the big one.I'm surprised Randy Johnson,another good stats man wasn't voted in by the judges,12 yr olds."
3,Nice presentation...,"Of course there would be controversies.Starting with a premise to namethe 100 greatest ball players would be difficult.Theseselections,though border on the absurd.Nolan Ryan{?]ROGERCLEMENS{?!}Ken Griffey,Jr. Mark Mcgwire??????Wher are the graet negroleague players?Cal Ripken Jr. Who voted on this?These selections arelaughable....Hank Greenburg, Buck Leonard,Joh Henry LLoyd[Babe Ruthsaid he was the greatest player he ever saw}Tom Seaver,JuanMarichal.Sigh.Home Runs and strikeouts rule.This is a list forchildren.Simply terible.That said, the publishers have done a fine jobwith the presentation. The pictures are fine,of excellent quality, thebook, a coffee table tome,actually, is nice to hold and look at,thewriting is fair,not great,simply adequete.With what they had to workwith,they could have done much much more."
5,I Depend on Garlic,"If you are considering using garlic, talk to your doctor (mine recommended this). Garlic can thin your blood, and if you are already taking blood thinners you could have problems. I've used Kyolic Garlic for several years at a high dose daily for allergies and sinus problems. Sinus infections are a nasty thing of the past now.If you research Kyolic brand you will see that it has been through rigorous studies and is found to be beneficial for the body in many ways. Another plus is that no matter how much you take, you won't smell like garlic."
3,Bought this for a friend,"My elderly friend asked me to buy her a new bottle so rather than drive around town looking for it , I went on-line and bought it through Amazon."
5,Raffi in Concert,Hello! - While I haven't played the DVD - I'm surely expecting it to be great. My grandson was just born - so we have some time to check it out and learn the songs. Thank you for offering this on Amazon!
5,Great DVD For All Ages,"This is a timeless DVD for any age. It's a feel good DVD for any child or adult, great songs that should be taught to every child and a great way to spend some quality time with your child. You can't go wrong ordering this DVD. Fast delivery. No problems here. Would purchase from this seller again."
3,Rafi in Concert,"This video is nothing but Rafi sitting on stage singing his songs. Very simple--no visual or sound effects added---But younder children (2-5 years) who know his songs seem captivated by it. It's a wholesome way to entertain a child for a short period while parents get a little work done. My granddaughter is multiply handicapped, and she loves the video, so it's a blessing for us!"
1,didn't even last 24 hours,"I bought this drum for my twin 3 year old boys. I read several reviews that said it was durable. The drum didn't even last a whole day. The top is a thin layer of plastic that busted with in a couple of hours - the metal drum fell apart, it is VERY thin & flimsy - it didn't hold up at all. Total waste of money."
2,Not worth the price,"For the price, this was not a very durable drum. When it arrived, it was unusable. The top band was not set right, so the plastic piece that the kids beat on, was not secure. It could not be fixed. As a whole, it was a pretty flimsy product. It looks better in the picture."
1,Broke Within An Hour,"I bought this for my 2 year old. He loved it, but that was short-lived because he destroyed it almost immediately. Very cheaply made product. The clear plastic came unglued from the tin, the drumsticks are really small, and the tin dents easily. Would not recommend this drum unless your child is VERY gentle with toys."
3,drum,Ti's very small and they didn't show the balls inside the drum witch I don't like. I thought the quility would be better.
3,"""aluminum"" drum","I got this drum for my sons first birthday because he loves to bang on daddy's real one so much, I thought he might enjoy his own.I was right, he does! He loves it! My 2 yr old daughter does too! The problem I have is that it's so cheaply made that when my daughter dropped it(from one step up)it put a dent in the side of it and I can't get it to bend back. Every time I try a diiferent spot starts to bend. Considering the cost I'm not to upset. Afterall, you get what you pay for. I think it'll last until he moves on to the next phase. I'd have to find something to do with it then anyway."
2,Fell apart,I bought it for my two years oldHe liked it very much and than destroyed it easly. When falls on the floor it bends untill a complete destractionProbably the only toy that we bought so far that fell apart easyThe cover is plasticand the body is cheap tin
2,LITTLE Toy drum.,"I ordered this drum to be used in the Nutcracker Ballet, but it is way too small. You can't tell from the photo, but it is TINY! It would be okay for a two or three year old, but not for an older child."
2,Broke too quickly,"My boys, ages 4 years and 15 months, received this drum for Christmas and it was immediately a favorite toy! I loved the size and sound of the drum. We were all very disappointed that after 4 weeks the drum is broken beyond repair. Now I know I have boys but they truly only treated this toy like a drum and beat on it with the sticks provided and occasionally some of my kitchen wooden spoons. I didn't feel like the treatment it received warranted it breaking so quickly."
2,Destroyed,"We got this for our 4 yr old for Christmas, because he loves drums. Our 3 yr old had it destroyed within 30 minutes of taking all the Christmas gifts into the toy room. We're not exactly sure what he did, but it was crushed, so he could get the balls out."
2,"Cute, but not what we expected.","This drum isn't too bad, but we failed to realize it has 3 large balls in the drum that you can see thru the top and they rattle around like a baby toy. My 3 year old just wanted to shake this thing around to make the balls rattle instead of actually using it as a drum...a bit disappointed and I've already hidden it in the closet as the shaking makes it sort of irritating."
5,Fun drum,Great drum that we got for our son the just turned 2. It is easy for him to carry around and make his music
2,a bit crappy,"For $15 I would have hoped for a better made drum- Within 2 weeks of Christmas, my 2 year old son, stepped on it and broke it- he wasn't really interested in it to begin with and he generally likes musical instruments. Next time I would get a natural toy from a fair trade store or something- I have since seen drums for children that are less expensive than this and sturdier- this has a tin like structure around the body, but the top and bottom of the drum is just clear plastic. It is cute looking on a shelf, but toys are meant to be played with!"
4,Little Drummer Boy,I got this drum to go with my nephew's Halloween costume and the fact that he loves to play the drums. There are 3balls inside which makes no sense but don't cause any problems. the sides come up slightly higher than normal and makes it a little difficult for him to play but he still enjoys it.
2,"Fun, but broke quick","My kids loved the drum, but it broke already. Now I have a broken drum that no one can play with that can't be returned."
2,Poorly design,My 3 yr old son destroy in no time by playing the drums. This was pooly made from flimsy material that will not hold up to the power of a 3 yr old toddler.
1,Cheap...Cheap...Cheap!,Our son recieved this drum from his grandmother three days ago for his birthday. He used it once and set it up on a shelf and the tin part of the drum collapsed on itself and it is now ruined...I think this drum is meant to be a decoration and NOT a childs toy! It is extremely fragile and is covered in very lightweight cardboard paper. The drum material is basically a sheet of transparency page clear lightweight plastic. If your child is even half the kid mine is it will be broken within a week! It's best feature is the look of it. If you are buying it as an untouchable decoration item then this is the right purchase for you!
3,Small Drum,"I bought this for my almost 3 year old because he fell in love with marching bands on some of the nick jr shows that hes inot. its a small drum and hes thrilled with it/ the clear plastic drum surface has some dents from my toddlers ""misuse' of the drum sticks. For the price its a cute little drum. When hes older and has more dexterity we'll get him the more expensive full set if hes still interested. I would recommend this on the understanding that its not a musical instrument to really practice on, more of a toy to get them interested in that field."
1,Fell Apart,My son got got this drum for his Birthday - he was so excited and had a lot of fun playing it. The first time he took it off - it fell on our hard wood floor and completely fell apart. Really disapointing for Schylling who usually has quality products. Don't buy unless you are just planing to put it on a shelf to look at - to fragile for use...
5,Great flavor for the price!,"I disagree with a prior reviewer who feels this is the same as cheap brands. Comparing this to national brands available in chain grocery stores, there is no comparison. I first received this balsamic as a gift many years ago, and have purchased it ever since - wherever I can find it! Certainly, if you are seeking a 20 year aged balsamic at $60 a pop, or you are a connoisseur likely to have 6 different types of balsamic in your cupboard, this may not for you. But if you are seeking a reasonably priced brand with great flavor, and want to venture away from the cheap store brands and seek some new flavors, this is the one! I make a dressing that is 1 part honey, 3 parts balsamic, and 6 parts oil that is fantastic! I find this brand very versatile for salads, fish, meats without having to buy the most expensive Modena balsamics. Try it - you'll like it! Great great flavors for the price!"
1,Cancer causing caramel coloring,"Paying what I did for this, I would expect it to have real ingredients and not the same cancer causing caramel coloring I could get in a $2 or $3 bottle of Balsamic vinegar from a local store and not pay 10 times the price I did for this bottle. I bought this paying more because I was hoping to avoid caramel coloring. I mean, if my goal were to purchase a product with lots of caramel coloring and get cancer, I could have bought 32, two liter bottles of Wal Mart cola for the price I paid for this one bottle."
2,Meh,This stuff tastes like an overly sweet Koolaid drink. It has no body and too little taste. Don't purchase ! Save for the real deal.
3,Syn - 'Syndestructible' (Umbrello Records) 3 1/2 stars,"Until fairly recent, I was never even aware of this band. This 2005 reunion release isn't as good as their 'Original Syn' record but it's still decent. A worthy reunion between two original Syn members, Yes bassist and founder Chris Squire and vocalist Stephen Nardelli. Best described as well-produced progressive. Better cuts are ""Some Time, Some Way"", the Yes-like ""Reach Outro"", the snappy ""City Of Dreams"" and the intricate thirteen-minute ""The Promise"". The other personnel on this CD: Paul Stacey-guitar&vocals, Gerald Johnson-keyboards&vocals and Jeremy Johnson-drums. Should appeal to fans of (I'm second guessing here, now) Tomorrow, Primitives, Yes (of course) and Lower Third."
5,Amazing!,"What a refreshing surprise! I am such a Yes fan; Chris Squire is different, but solid all the way through. I've listen to the album about 6-7 times in the past 24 hours. Its gets better and better every time. Treat yourself! I am not sure how this will fall on the radar of popular music, but this is one of the best recordings of ""new"" music that I have heard in many many years!"
5,what an album!!,Anyone who loves music should get this album.It is superb on every level from the quality of the songs to the great musicianship and arrangement.Squire and Nardelli are amazing!
3,"Pleasant, but not amazing.","Frankly, this work somewhat disappoints me. After listening to Yes for 30 some years, I find the lyrics definitely superficial and lacking in this work. True,the instrumentation is not lacking here, but the spiritual content is just not here in this work as I had hoped. I also feel that Steve Nardelli,s voice is pleasant enough, but not compelling.Nonetheless, if a listener is not as demanding as myself, one would probably find this body of work pleasant and enjoyable."
4,A good how-to-book on the topic of Personal Magnetism,"This book gives clear and precise instructions on how to use the 'power' of personal magnetism. With the teachings in this book, such things as influence, telepathy, and suggestion can be made to serve the user of. In terms of occult books in the west, this book--and just about all the other books from the same publisher--Yoga Publication Society are excellent in giving clear instructions without the usual obscure veils meant to illude the inexperienced reader."
1,Contains no pictures.,This book is described as having over 840 color pictures. It does not have a single picture...A price book with no pictures is useless to me.
5,Great product,This is exactly what I needed for my Biology class. It is an excellent model of the lungs and shows great detail!
3,Lung Model,The model once put together is great. However instruction not clear enough for a 10 year old to put together.
4,CLASSIC,Great Send Off For One Of The Best Series Of All Time. Well Worth It For Fans Of The Seventies Series.
2,"Buyer beware, edited episodes","Have seen a picture of the rear box art and the infamous Paramount disclamer (Edited content, music changes) is listed on it. So once again if you buy this set understand that you will NOT be seeing the original classic episodes as they were originally broadcast."
1,Garbage! Paramount are thieves without guns.,"Every season of this classic show has been slapped together with no thought given to the presentation. Even one edit is unacceptable but these releases are sliced and diced and it is evident even to people unacquainted with the original episodes let alone the true fans. It is just this type of slap in the face to fans that makes people turn to bootlegs. I support the legitimate releases and this is what I get for it? Thanks for nothing.Add to this the fact that there is nothing in the way of extras, not even so much as a single outtake, an interview or a trailer. You can be sure that I won't buy any future Paramount DVD products until I've read a couple dozen reviews."
3,"OK, but music edits don't make sense.","Overall OK, but I know of several edits that are unnecessary and really detract from the overall humor of the show.Anyway, can anyone explain this to me:How come in ""This is the Army Mrs Madison"", Murray can play ""I love you truly"" on his harmonica, but they cut out felix's singing of the song? Do they have to pay for words and not the music? I don't get it. The musical cuts in all the seasons were bad, but it is getting rediculous."
2,Cuts and more cuts,"I have to agree that Paramount is not doing a good job with securing music rights. The episode, ""Gloria Moves In"" was one of the ones where Felix starts singing and the rest of the group joins in. It's funny, but it is cut. Very obvious. I also much rather prefer they leave the original Paramount Logo at the end with ""A Gulf & Western Company."" I don't need to be reminded that its now CBS/Paramount."
2,I refuse to buy Volume 5,"An extra star has been added merely because it's the great Odd Couple.I have purchased the first four seasons of one of my all-time favorite series, The Odd Couple, but I refuse to buy Season 5. It's simply too painful to pay hard-earned money, then see how something I've waited 30+ years to view has been butchered due to the cheapskates at CBS.I am so sick of being sold short by corruptorate fat cats. Until I can be assured that all five seasons have been restored and re-released, I will be boycotting everything CBS and/or Paramount releases. Everything.I feel thoroughly cheated. It seems that in the case of The Odd Couple, F.U. does not stand for Felix Unger. It's what CBS is saying to its customers by cheating us. :-/"
1,"I Don't Like Cuts, Cuts, Cuts, In My Discs, Discs, Discs","""The Odd Couple"" is my all-time, number one favorite TV show. And not being able to own the complete series on DVD is one of the saddest things ever to happen. I bought the first two seasons. They were great. Season three onward were butchered beyond belief. I honestly don't know what, if anything, Paramount was thinking to allow such an atrocious release. I used to watch The Odd Couple on TV Land years ago. The cuts on this DVD are even worse than in syndication! Further more, I used to own (back when I still had a working VCR) the complete Columbia House VHS set. I really wish I had hung on to those, because every episode they released (although they only released half the series) was uncut, with all the original music intact. These DVDs are not even worth the plastic used to make them."
4,Good blend; traditional and origional styles of dancehall!,"If this was a big name artist this would be large. Briefly and to the point; (1)Physically Phit - good melody, nice flow with a finished riddim. (5)Rasta Symphony - one of the top 5 Reggae\Symphony tunes I've ever heard. Strong lyrics ,good melody and harmony. (6) I See The Light - Conscience ting, food for the brain of the righteous. There's other good tracks as well, the whole Album was well produced."
2,Too expensive for what it offers,"The book is geared toward people who want to sell stuff or take advantage of the Associates program. It's really a better-organized version of Amazon.com's own help pages (which are more accurate but harder to navigate). If this book were half the price I'd give it 4 stars, but it's too expensive for the limited content."
2,Amazon's improving usability renders this book unnecessary,"When this book was first published, it might have been somewhat relevant. However, Amazon has continuously upgraded the usability of its site to the point that where the answer to any question you might actually have about its features is now on the website, including forums where you can discuss individual books, and even a forum where users discuss the well guarded formula for ranking Amazon reviewers, which one clever person came up with via experimentation. Also, Amazon's interface and features are constantly being changed and upgraded, so that some of the specific information in this book is no longer correct. I give this book two stars only because it is well written, but I strongly advise against buying it."
1,Waste of Money,"I can only assume that the positive reviews were written by relatives and friends of the author. This book is only useful if you are totally unable to search a database by typing in ""rolling pin"", and if you are interested in doing a lot of programming to accomplish simple and mostly useless tasks. As a seller on Ebay, I found nothing of use in this book, and, as a purchaser, I am capable of finding a ""flashlight"" without doing a lot of programming. This book is highly oversold. Save your money."
4,can't get unwired,"Small form factor, rugged anodized aluminum case, light-weight. Almost everything you could ask for. The combo (usb 2.0/firewire) version REQUIRES the power adapter to be plugged in at all times. This is the only down side. If you don't need firewire compatibility consider the ""USB 2.0 only"" version for hassle free use."
4,Pretty good,This meter has worked good but did not have to proper calibration tools. It took a little while to get here but it was with in the dates listed. Product overall: Good!
4,Mr. Moto In Manchuria,This book is an exciting thriller written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. Most of the story takes place on a trip by two young Americans to Ghuru Nor in Mongolia prior to World War II.
4,A nice mix.,It was the MP3 file of Intimate that made me buy the CD. I wasn't disappointed either. There is a cut on the CD that I swear has a female singer who sounds remarkably like Anita Baker. That through me for minute. I recommend Intimate by Raymond Jones.
5,Another great one from McManus,"Patrick McManus is an amazing writer who will lighten your spirit and make you laugh out loud. Very easy reading chapters (short stories) that most can relate to and identify with. Once you read him you will be glad you did, and just want to read more and share with others. On a recent camping trip I read a story each night around the camp fire and it was a very enjoyable time for all. It will make you laugh I guarantee...unless you're asleep of course or just way too grumpy. Enjoy life and read McManus, and you'll be glad you did. Promise!!"
5,Great Reading,"This book brings a new meaning to outdoor lit. His humorus tales and fun characters make this book fun for all ages. For anyone looking for good reading or even for humorus interp. for speach as I did, Patrick Mcmanus is on the top of the list."
2,"good stories, uninspired narration","Terry Beaver's narration is disappointing. He can't hold a candle to George S. Irving or to P. MacManus in narrating MacManus' tales. It doesn't seem that Beaver understands the underlying gist much of the time, so his diction doesn't add to the hilarity of the tale."
3,Not His Best,"I did finish it, but it did not give the in-depth feeling for the characters that his other novels have had. I really didn't ""care"" about the characters like I usually do with his books. I hope he goes back to the lawyer scene next time that he does so well."
1,Critical Mistake,"I usually am very loyal to authors I've come to prize and buy their hardcover editions to show my support. I had a collection of Steve Martini's work right up until I bought Critical Mass.I know everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I also am entitled to not having to pay for someone mocking mine. Specifically by ridiculing a President and his wife whom I enthusiastically support.Dale Brown did the same thing some time in the past and I quit reading the offending book mid-page and tossed all of his work. Tom Clancy did a similar thing when saying that he felt persecuted for smoking (after all, it wasn't like he had AIDS!). Out that pile of paper went.I hope Martini feels better now that he's catharsis'ized his political opinions, and that the good feelings are enough to offset the minimal amount of discomfort my ceasing to further contribute to his income will cause.Plus, look at the book shelf space I freed up!"
2,Boring and predictable,"I was very disappointed in this book, especially as all the reviews were so great, and surprised to find myself rather bored with it. My first Martini book was Double Tap, which I was very impressed with. Reading this book was almost like it was written by another author. I found the characters flat, none of whom I cared about except the Dutchman, and the plot seemed well put together, but somehow predictable."
2,Disappointed,"Compelling Evidence was the first Steve Martini novel I read and I loved it. I then read Critical Mass and was thoroughly disappointed. The plot was predictable, except for a surprise ending, at which point I had already lost interest. I will stick to the Paul Madriani series."
1,Get an Editor!,"I have read all of Steve Martini's books and this is the worst (by far). The writing is very sloppy and could have used several re-writes. There is a reasonable plot here, but the writing is so bad that it detracts from the story. The dialogue is so wooden at times to be almost laughable. I have noticed that when Steve Martini wanders out of the legal drama genre, his writing seems to deteriorate. Stick to what you do best Steve and get a better editor!"
4,Good but his earlier works were great,"Martini is one of the top fiction writers in the country. This doesn't hold up to his earlier books but is still better than most of what is out there. Also I recommend checking Bob Mayer's thrilers-- I've searched for new stuff by him but haven't been able to find any, but his old books are really good."
2,Disappointing for Martini fans,"I am a huge fan of Steve Martini. I liked every one of his books, ""The List"" being my favourite. This, however, was a letdown. Terrorism, a nuclear bomb, covert operations, this has Tom Clancy written all over it. I was lost in pages of descriptions of nuclear devices, radioactive waste and the likes. Exactly the reason why I don't like Clancy. And an ending that calls for a sequel. I am not sure that I want to read it, if Martini writes it.Well, if you are a die-hard Martini fan, you probably need to read this, if not, please, stay away and read one of his other books, they are all a lot better."
5,Martini is one of the best,"~Joss Cole is happy to have left the rat race as a Los Angeles public defender for the serene Puget Sound area. Her cases are no brainers until a group of local fishermen come down with a strange illness that Joss feels is industrial related. <P~ Before Joss can learn what happened to her client, he dies in an explosion. Within a few hours of Dean's death, unknown assailants try to kill Joss. Later on, a nuclear expert comes to the island searching for two missing nuclear devices, which Joss concludes is what led to the ailment of the fishermen. Now all she has to do is find the devices before they are used against America. <P~ please anyone who enjoys a non-stop, action-packed thriller. Readers of this novel will have the impetus of perusing Mr. Martini's previous tales (see THE LIST and UNDUE INFLUENCE, etc.) because all of this writer's novels will be judged as compelling evidence on how great of an author Mr. Martini truly is.<P"
3,A TOO-DRY MARTINI,"I am basically a Steve Martini fan. When he is at his best, there is none better. When he is not at the top of his form, you have a book like this: not bad, not that good. The storyline involving a missing nuclear device has been done before and better. While the book is a page turner, getting me to read the last 200 pages at one sitting, I still had no real sense of enjoyment after completing it. The characters were too stereotypical, especially Belden/Thorn and Joss, who never really came across as an appealing individual whom one could care about and really root for over the course of the novel. Maybe Martini got tired of Paul Madriani and the legal thrillers, but I hope he returns to them soon. The List was not up to his standards, neither is Critical Mass. Critical Mass was not terrible, but there is really nothing special about it. I read it, but it was just another book."
2,Critical Disappointment,"I'm normally a Martini fan, but this one lacked something - sympathetic and interesting characters for one thing. I think a large part of the problem is that he tried to incorporate the viewpoints of too many characters. Did we really need to read about the viewpoint of the Militia guy with the cute posterior? Martini kept skipping from one set of characters to another. In the end, I really didn't like any of them."
4,all good except the end,"Well i agree with most of the readers only that i find that the end is a bit dissapointing. If the readers doesnt know what i am talking about, here is a clue (the little boy should have gone off)"
1,TERRIBLE!DONT WASTE YOUR TIME READING IT.,A hell of a dissappointment. A waste of a rental.Dont blow up your money or your time reading this.It is not like his other books.
2,Compelling Story Ruined by Sloppy Editing,"I just picked up Critical Mass, my first Steve Martini, attracted by the storyline. I'm about 200 pages in, and while I like the overall story so far, I must say that reading it has been very disappointing. One reason, the major one, is the very sloppy editing. Some sentences run on, some are incomplete, some make no sense whatsover, and a lot of necessary punctuation is missing, which is very distracting to the flow of reading. I should have known there would be a problem when the book jacket spells the protagonist's name Jocelyn, but in the story it's Joselyn. The other reason is that so far, the characters aren't all that sympathethic, and there hasn't been enough background on the main character of Joselyn Cole.Hope it gets better as I go along."
4,Well written and disturbingly plausible,"I had not previously read anything by Martini and always assumed he dealt exclusively in the legal thriller .Critical Mass does not come into this category despite having a lawyer as the heroine .Instead we get a smooth , polished and proficient international thriller revolving around the theft of nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union and the attempt by terrorists to deploy them against the USA in particular the President as he gives a key address to Congress .It is disturbingly detailled in the way points out the flaws in the security of the weapons stockplied in the FSU and refreshingly cynical about politicians all around the globe .Adequate characterization and a lawyers grasp of drama make for good beach or airline fodder with enough grit to resonate in your mind for some while ."
5,The verdict is in this tight woven thriller,***** Exceptionally intrigue thriller by the author of the Judge. Great plotting through out! I just can't believe that Martini can actually make me read every page. Great pulse pounding.
2,a technothriller that lacks the brain,"Critical Mass is my first Steve Martini book. I hope his other novels are better because... The story is full of cardboard characters who perform actions that made no sense. For example, any hospital noticing such serious cases of radiation among the fishermen will report the illnesses to the government. You would not have to wait until a local lawyer starts investigating the lawsuit potential! I guess such logical actions cannot take place because the story would end right on the first chapter. The more the story progresses, the more it feels like a story of how wrong things can go. Unfortunately, stories of how things can go wrong tend not to be fun to read.If you want a superb story of terrorists taking the world hostage, try Devil's Alternative by Frederick Forsyth, and skip this one."
3,"All style, no substance","If all you want out of a comic is 200 pages of fight scenes, then by all means pick up this book. The artwork is fantastic, but I also like having a bit of story to back up good artwork."
2,fun but shallow,"I'm not gonna ramble on about this book just give my own honest opinion of what I thought. I was taken in by the wacky, dynamic, scott pilgrim-esc style of corey lewis' artwork initially but upon reading it it failed to live up to my expectations. If you're looking for a comic book story with substance you won't find it here unfortunately, It's pretty much just an excuse to feature page to page action sequences (which at times can be hard to comprehend) with plenty fighting game references to boot. The first few pages provide all the exposition leaving the rest of the book devoid of any depth or reason to identify with any of the characters or situations they are placed in. All in all this is more of a tribute for the scott pilgrim fans .. oh and if you happen to love sharks and ninjas."
3,I totally agree....,This author had me in this story totally up until they married. It lost something in the chemistry between the hero and heroine after that. I've struggled slowly through the hero's revelation to the heroine. I think the story lost it's interesting touch when author took the couple out of the Court and away from the royal family. Now I'm ready to start skimming through the book until the couple gets back to court.
4,decent,decent backpack . Have had it for a year now . little wear . Not the sturdiest i have come across.The Headphones : I find that the sound level in left and right ear are different and is a little annoying . the noise cancellation is lame . Most noise reduction comes from how very tight the headphones fit on your head . Just remember that this is nothing more than a free bee headphone and targus is not exactly a player in the area.
2,A real disappointment,"There are a few good stories in this edition,but Reilly really dropped the ball more often than not. To many lengthy stories that just aren;t that interesting(Rae Carruth,moronic backyard wrestling)and far too many stories associated with death. Can we actually focus on the sports a little more? There are also too many articles on obscure topics."
2,The Tale of the Brown Bunny,"See Vincent. See Vincent drive. See Vincent stop for gas. See Vincent drive some more. See Vincent's hair get greasier every scene. See Vincent ride his little motorbike. Oooh, Vincent's a big boy now, he can ride a motorbike. See Vincent confuse some trailer chicks. See Chloe. See more of Chloe and Vincent than you thought you'd ever see. See Vincent cry. See Vincent drive some more. The End. For those who needed to know how to make a 92-minute movie from a 5-page script, there you go!"
2,An Oscar Trivia Question!,"This is a slow paced, dreary and dull film. For almost an hour, I was trying to figure out who this Bud Clay fellow is and why all these women are talking, or lack of, to a complete stranger. Once he gets to his destination, we see the real reason for this film. By that time, it's too late to even care. Vincent Gallo is a poor filmmaker. His previous effort (Buffalo '66) was in the same vein of work. This, however can be considered pornography! With that thought...Who is the first Academy Award nominated actor/actress to perform actual oral sex on screen? The answer to that question is Chlo Sevigny (Best Supporting Actress Nominee for Boys Don't Cry, 1997). And in this film, nothing is left for the imagination."
1,"Very Much A ""D"" movie",This movie was by far the worst I have seen in some time. Lack creativity and was very boring. The director demonstrated limit depth in cinema. The acting was awful as well. This movie was done some time ago and I hope the actors have work on their craft.
1,It was odd.....,It was basically mostly about a guy on the road driving for a long time. Way too much road scenes. Although it did have one racy scene.
3,"Gallo is in the driver's seat, literally.","Gallo is in the driver's seat, literally. This film is an exercise in patience. All of the shots through-the-windshield were a bit tedious. But Gallo does what he can to make you a passenger on his long, lonely journey.Sorry, no big explosions, witty one-liners, etc here. Instead, a man on a mission, a pilgrimage. Perhaps a second viewing with the realized ending in mind will effect you differently.By all means, not the worst movie ever. Just extremely personal.I still rank Buffalo '66 as my favorite Gallo film and one of my all-time favorites, period. If you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor and give it the once over twice.Pass the popcorn..."
1,What a waste of time.....,"At some stage I had to put this movie at double speed. The guy who made the movie and play the lead role is a total egocentric, thinking that his vision will make a great road movie. Wrong. It take more than this to make a good road movie."
3,the brown bunny controversy?,"very different type of film.if you are a fan of vincent gallo,this movie is very much like his other films.intropspective and offbeat.the controversial scene that made this film to me was not all that shocking,maybe due to the fact that the context in which the scene took place was not at all sexually charged,but more sad.a good film if you like gallo."
1,"A Haiku, inspired by ""The Brown Bunny""","""Man, this movie sucks /with the same vaccuum power /that Chloe displays.""the end"
1,waste of space,"I was really shocked that someone of Chloe Sevigny's talent chose to do such a trite little film.The brown bunny is a story of a man who , haunted by his personal demons, takes a road trip. Along the way he meets and discards women. The driving scenes did nothing to help the pace of an already slow film., the storyline was somewhat silly and the ending left much to be desired.The rather crude sex scenesreally added nothing to the movie.When I saw it many people left long before the ending. Wish that i had had that wisdom. I only regret that the cinema did not have a return policy ."
1,"Moments of Brilliance, but Wasted","Vincent Gallo, indulging himself in more ways than one. A road film which feels pieced-together as it goes, a bit like THE RAIN PEOPLE, but without any of that film's minor-key beauty and mystery. If you've seen BUFFALO 66, you'll wonder what happened to Gallo's brilliant scene-making, his exquisite stylistic touches, his perfect-pitch dialogue and the oddball beauty of the characters' interactions. BROWN BUNNY, in contrast, feels like an exercise that fell flat. It might have made a nice short film, I suppose, say, ten minutes at the most."
2,Art or Self Absorbed Waste of Celluloid?,"I think the latter. I apologize if I offend Vincent Gallo/Vincent Gallo Fans, but this was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever experienced. I loved Buffalo 66, but what the heck was this?! One hour and 15 minutes of Gallo's character driving across country. You could watch this movie in maybe 20 minutes if you put it on fast forward, while using the subtitle option on your DVD player. There is little to no dialogue of any importance. The whole movie is summed up in the last 15 minutes of the movie, when we finally see Gallo's monster phallus and Chloe Sevigny servicing it. The story itself is very sad, and really could've been done better with a rewrite (including some freaking dialogue) and a few extra likeable characters. I really wanted to like this movie, and I felt kind of cheated."
4,BLOWN AWAY,"This is a Bergman/Antonioniesque film done by a guy who probably grew up in a trailer park.Gallo has talent as a filmmaker. I loved the road shots through the dirty windshield. Every other filmmaker has used a clean windshield but it your windshield is anything like mine, it is never that clean.The Acting: Gallo (the actor, as opposed to Gallo, the director) cannot act and has absolutely no charisma. But Chloe Sevigny deserves an Special Oscar. She really got into some aspects of her performance, and exhibited a deep desire to satisfy certain requirements that were quite hard."
2,Fair Enough,"The draw to watch this flick was Chlo Sevigny. Interesting that she did this film after Boys Don't Cry and other big films, so she clearly wasn't needing to do graphic sex scenes. At only an hour and a half long, this film should have been maybe 40 minutes. Although fairly well acted and lovely, it lagged with arthouse montage and long scenic travel shots. If a film translated into a short story, this would have been a captivating read. The connections between the women in the film, their names, the foreshadowing... all nice subtle suspense builders. It was just too little a story to be spread over a big screen."
2,"Not really worth reviewing, but worth a warning.","I'm not sure that this could be considered a movie as much as a total and complete waste of time and an insult to intelligence. I detected nothing that even resembled a story, nothing that would qualify as acting and a total lack of creativity. There is, however, lots of footage of the leading man/director/cameraman & editor driving down some of America's nicest highways. Filler no doubt. The scenery surrounding said highways being the only interesting feature of this ""movie?"". The ""star"" of this flick plays a man, no, a worm wallowing in gross self pity while wearing a demented facial expression throughout, ending up on a bed in a fetal position and sobbing like a fool. Watch this flick if you have absolutely nothing better to do. I do mean absolutely nothing."
3,ORAL SEX,"This movie to me was slow and boring. It centered around a young man I felt was basically a whiner. The fact is that, the very best part of this film, and the reason it got what attention it did was because of the REAL ( not simulated ) oral sex scene in which Chole very clearly swallowed at the end. This is the only thing I can see that would get it any attention and the only reason I rated it with a 3.Steve Of Tenn.."
3,"Besides the porn scene, A very good art film","If you have patience and enjoy art films, this is really fine stuff. Gallo compells the audience with mood, humor, and sheer will. His energy as a filmmaker is through the roof and hypnotic.The only downsides are the porn scene with Sevigny(it really was not needed and adds nothing, feels tacked on.) And also the fact that the movie has a heroin 70's feel to it that you see in magazine ads all the time. So it's not that original a style.Those complaints aside, it's shows a lot of heart and courage."
1,Brown bunny,Wow I really want my money and my time back. Dont ever watch this movie. It doesn't even deserve one star rating.
2,Could have better,"What a boring movie, good actors but boring as hell. Even the sex scene couldn't save this one."
2,"Skip to the BJ, This Movie is That Bad","I'm not exactly sure what Galo was going for, but he sure needs a lesson in COMPRESSION.A painter knows that to paint, what to depict on the canvas and, as important, what NOT to show. Galo works on too big a canvas.Too many pointless shots, scenes, and dialogues. This movie could be widdled down to 30 minutes and still have the same impact, if not more.If you are intent on seeing ""the scene,"" rent or Netflix this one. Otherwise, I recommend staying away."
1,definitely not mainstream,"Read the story description, it says it all. You see a bit of motorcycle racing at the beginning, the rest of the movie is pretty much shot through the mostly dirty windshield of the main characters van as he drives cross country. He has some dialogue with the parents of his ex girl friend who are taking care of her brown bunny, this lasts about three minutes, there's another two minutes of dialogue with a prositute in Vegas and about the same with a small town waitress, he crashes at a budget hotel in LA, leaves a note for his ex who shows up and they too have about two minutes of dialogue, then she gives him around five minutes of oral sex and the credits roll. Strange movie, I obviously didn't quite get the director's point.Great movie to have on in the background while you are reading a book."
1,DID SOMEONE SAY,Did some critic or other say this movie is boring? THis movie stretches the boundary of Vanity Projects! Pointless self indulgence comes to mind. If you're into celebrity skin then probably this is for you but then again I'm even seriously thinking is this DVD worth the space in my collection?
4,"""Pornography or Art?""","This question gets asked a lot, as if a film couldn't be both. ""Brown Bunny"" appears to be driven more by loneliness than porn fantasy. It's beautifully shot, which enables us to accept some of Gallo's narcissism. Chloe Sevigny accepted an extreme role with respect to sexual intimacy. She's a trooper - hopefully Chloe has expanded options as opposed to requirements for other actors. As I saw ""Brown Bunny"" I was getting sold on it - until the very end - the party scene. Why did Gallo leave Chloe in basically the same unredeemable ending as ""Kids?"""
1,The Brown Bunny,One of those movies where you just kept watching to see if it would get better......than it was over!
1,The worst movie I've ever seen,"This is literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of them.Walk into any video store blindfolded and throw a dart and you will absolutely get a better movie than this one (unless of course your dart happens to land on this movie, which is unlikely).Don't say I didn't warn you should you decide to buy or rent The Brown Bunny. It plays like a college or even high school film project that the professor gave an failing grade to. Everything about this movie is sophmoric. Seriously, you are better off throwing that dart I mentioned and watching whatever movie you hit."
1,Yawn,"To keep myself from falling asleep during this incredibly boring movie, I finally picked a book and started reading.Thank God/dess, it was only 92 minutes long and I didnt see it in a movie theater..."
2,Did we do something to offend you?,"Oh the tedium... All that pointless driving... did we do something to mr. Gallo that we need to be punished for? And that resolution ... For cryin' out loud... such bottomless sorrow. Oh Mr. Gallo, You must be close to 40, so what's with the broken young rebel schtik? As for the infamous scene...it dunna good movie make."
5,Lush and Breezy,I liked the film...esp the soundtrack choices....a little oral sex never hurt anyone.....an enjoyable experience.
4,"I loved it. Mood, plot and Chloe Sevigny.","I know this film is reviled by many but I found it captivating. Having driven across the US many times and having lived in a lot of less than stellar towns, this film struck many notes with me. I know that road and it was the first time I thought anyone captured the intimacy of the experience. I'm not a Vincent Gallo fan and I thought this was his best performance I've seen. Sevigny was a revelation. After the movie ended, I knew why she had done this picture.I nicked the film a star because of the amateurish way Gallo set up the credits. Yes, Vincent, we know you did the whole thing yourself. Tone it down, eh?"
5,5 stars for what I did see,"however I cannot personally endorse the entire film. This is because my girlfriend is a strict evangelist Christian type, so she took our copy of the movie to a local movie editing place (which are perfectly legal per the Supreme Court) that removed a scene which I hear contains some naughtiness. But I did see the rest of the movie and I can say that it is downright brilliant, and more beautiful than seeing life through my own eyes. I also liked the driving scenes because for unrelated reasons the state of Florida permanently revoked my driver's license, so driving scenes bring back fond memories of, well, driving. By the way what was in that missing scene anyway? I would search for it on the Internet but my girlfriend got us signed up on one of those ISPs that filters things. But I stay with her because she can drive."
3,Edgy and racey and provacative,This film was interesting... It is not your typical Hollywood flick. It is worth watching at least once to form your own opinion. Mr. Gallo definitely has an edgy style and artistic ability. And for that infamous scene with Ms. Sevigny... every man's fantasy. I added this to my collection.
2,I will admit it,"I got this movie orginally to see Vincent Gallo's schlong and that I did. That is why I did give this movie 2 stars. The story of this movie is very boring and it is a very dull movie all in all. The dialong is awful and it's actors are boring as well. I am sorry, but I will have to say don't even bother with this movie unless you want to see Vincent Gallo or Chlo Sevigny nude. Other than that, don't bother."
1,The Blow Bunny,"God-awful, pretentious, self-indulgent, soporific nonsense. Vince Gallo needs to lighten up and have his friends pitch in and buy him some film classes, or at least some classic movies on DVD.If I want to see a film shot almost entirely from the interior of a moving car looking through the windshield, I'll watch my own home movies from my last vacation. In fact, I may enter my home movies at the next Cannes Film Festival and see if I win any awards.Only redeeming scene is where Chloe Sevigney goes pole diving on Vincent Gallo, but like another viewer correctly suggests, the movie is not worth dying through for this one scene, so download it from a website instead. The DVD is suitable as a drink coaster or mini-frisbee."
1,Need an excuse?,"If you need a reason to finally pull the trigger and blow your brains out, the this movie is well worth the money. It's 90 minutes agonizing tedium followed by 3 minutes of Chlo Sevigny giving soft-porn oral. I guess I could give her bonus points for having sex with a guy for a change."
2,Chloe...are you feeling a little disappointed?,"If you can fast forward through 3/4 of the movie, the remaining bit will shock and stay with you. The majority of the film that you'll be skipping will include: driving, driving, oh, and more of Vincent driving. The shocking parts will include a gangbang and fellatio. Unforgettable yet forgettable...all at once. Quite a feat."
3,Watch this movie while sleepy or stoned.,"That's the secret, because it really is quite a movie, but your mind has to be slowed down to appreciate it. If you are in ""normal"" movie watching mode.......looking for excitement or intrigue or laughs, this will seem very slow and pointless. But with a little heaviness in the eyelids, the flow of the scenes and the abstract imagery will seem quietly mesmerizing. The songs in the film are just right. It's not a great film and not for everybody (especially those with an aversion to graphic sex), but not nearly as bad as some people have said. I stopped paying attention to Roger Ebert's opinions a long time ago!"
3,Challenging for sure.....,"...but I found this oddly hypnotic. This is not a movie you should watch if you have recently lost a loved one through death, divorce or breakup because if you weren't suicidal before, you will be afterward. It is basically a stream-of-consciousness type of film that centers on lonliness and remorse after the tragic loss of a loved one. Anyone who has gone through a devastating loss or breakup will get this movie. The rest will be puzzled and bored. I had the advantage of knowing a little about the story line beforehand, which helped me appreciate the film more than most reviewers here. What I liked most about the movie was the lack of ""Hollywood dialogue""....this just looks completely improvised (and perhaps it is), and therefore has a gritty, realistic, truthful feel to it. Buffalo '66 was darkly hilarious. This is darkly real (and one of the saddest films I have seen in a long time)."
4,The worst porn film ever made!!!,"...just kidding. but that's the only reason i could think of for this film getting a 1 star rating.Packing a slow-burning punch to the heart and soul, ' The Brown Bunny' gently reveals a lonely man's wanderings across america as he grapples with his life now seemingly anaesthetized by the absence of his former love.Recommended viewing, one of my favourite films of the year."
5,Looking For a Copy of This Book!,This is not a review as much as it is a plea to get a copy of this book. You see Jimmy was a friend of mine and I would really like to get a copy. So if anyone wants to sell their copy or hears of one thats available please let me know? Thank You.
3,Lexar Media 1 GB 80x Pro Series Compact Flash Card,Compare prices and features before buying. There are plenty media to choose from. Check features (speeds/security/etc.).My purchase functions satisfactorily.
1,Buy another brand,"I purchased my Lexar Flash 1 GB Card in January and placed it into service, light service at that, in the middle of February in my Canon 20D.It started acting squirrelly by the middle of April. I had to remove it and reinstall it several times to get it to work.Today it finally died and will not work at all.Ineed to buy another card, but it sure will NOT be a Lexar.At the price of these cards I expect it to work a lot longer than 2 months of light duty."
2,Corrupt pictures with Cannon Powershot G6 7MP camera,"Bought this CF card to be able to take many pictures on vacation. Indeed, it provided me with about 400 shot capacity. I could not see a difference in speed but that was not a major issue for me. When I downloaded the images to my PC, two of the 300 shots were corrupted. It appears there is an incompatibility with Cannon and I have to send the card to Lexar for a firmware update. This is annoying to say the least."
3,Good product - but don't buy it here....,"The seller that offers the product doesn't ship the product properly wrapped! It is an expensive and fragile item to be shipped in a simple envelop!! The product box and invoice were completely torn when I received it. Not worth the hassle - besides, they charge a high shipping fee for not even shipping the product in a box!!!"
4,Works well but Write Acceleration Technology may not be used,This Compact Flash card works very well with my Canon EOS 20D but I found out (Lexar's web site) that Lexar's Write Acceleration Technology is not supported by Canon (at least not officially). So may be for Canon camera's owners it's not worth buying the 1GB 80x card when the 1 GB 40x would suffice.
3,Was Expensive at the time,Bought this a long time ago and met the needs at the time. I filled it way too much and had to move on to a larger card. No problems at the time of purchase.
1,Don't buy this card!,"I'm a professional photographer, and I bought this card because of itswriting speed. After using it for a couple of months I would try to reviewimages in the camera and would get messages that the file was unavailable.I'd reformat the card and it would tell me that I had twice the images I was supposed to.I sent it back to Lexar for replacement and they said they never received it.I've used other cards from other manufacturers without any problems.I'll never purchase another Lexar product."
5,A call to action,"This book is great.If you ever thought that youth ministry was insignificant, think again!!"
2,Alarmist,This book presents relevant and true facts in an overly alarmist fashion. Obviously intended to create an emotional response that closes the ranks of Christian culture to keep the saved in and the unsaved out.
1,Comment on Ron Luce,"I just wanted to say that years ago I went to Ron Luce's Acquire the Fire program, and I am still emotionally scarred from it. He was very into the idea of purity pledges and such, and got us all to sign this ""Teenage Bill of Rights"" at the end, after he had spent the whole time manipulating our emotions to make us more likely to sign something too hastily. I know my reaction is abnormal, but I became obsessively worried by the idea that I had made a binding, life-long obligation, and when I emailed Teenmania (Luce's group that put on the program) about my situation, they were very unkind and seemed not to care about what they had done.I now have problems with Ron Luce on a number of levels, but this is the one that is most important to me. It is deeply unethical for Ron Luce and people like him to pressure young people into hasty oaths and vows. At best, it teaches them that your word is to be given lightly. At worst, as with me, it can deeply scar a child."
1,Step off your Moral High Horse,I'm honestly getting sick of these religious zealots trying to brain wash my generation into believing this crap. This so-called moral crisis is a complete fabrication. It's nothing more but fear mongering by radicals like Ron Dunce over here. I don't want to be saved so just stop. I'll be so glad when my generation grows up so that hopefully this stupid trend of blaming pop culture for all of society's problems will finally stop.
1,not that great of a book,"I originally had a really detailed review of this book but Amazon yanked it for some reason.This book is horrible and awful. The author spends time bashing non-Christians and blaming them for the decline of Christian youth. He spends little time talking about solutions to the problem, like getting rid of cable. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,You tell'em Ronny!,"Classic comedy from a queen of late night. If you haven't checked out the late night show on TBN, what are you waiting for? You don't have to pinch yourself, this book is real!"
4,good fun in new orleans,"Not a conoisseur of Ruffin's work, I can't really tell how representative this album is of his usual music;all I can say - it's fun, it's swinging, sometimes funky;a healthy mix of traditional jazz and pop-music - not insulting to jazz fans, entertaining enough for the wider audiences.Obviously, this entertainer's main influence is Louis Armstrong; it would be silly to compare him seriously with the good old Satchmo, but Kermit Ruffins definitively keeps a great deal of his legacy alive...Almost all of the songs feature Kermit's often charming vocals (in addition to the trumpet)."
3,"Muttsy feels good, but looses hair","The Muttsy Plush Toy is a great gift for any older kid or teen, but not for a tot. I got this for my 2 year-old niece, and though she does play with it, her mom is fearful that the hair that falls out might be inhaled. It sheds quite a bit of hair when being played with.All and all, other then the hair problem, it's a fun toy."
5,Great Dog,Both my boys had this dog as their favorite stuffed animal that they slept with and still do.It is very huggable and has held up well.
5,"Cate's favorite pal, Dog-dog","Cate(2 years old) received Dog-dog (Mutsy) for Christmas last year and won't go anywhere without it. Unfortunately, we lost it last week and had to do some quick research to discover the brand and name. Thanks to Amazon.com we are able to replace it. In fact we ordered 2, to be on the safe side."
3,"PLEASE DON'T KILL ME, I HAVE A DOG AND 3 CATS","Randy (David Leo Schultz) is a production assistant who is also narcoleptic. When he passes out he dreams about bad movie spoofs. The film company he works for creates ""B"" grade movie rip offs and is going broke. They decide to make a spoof movie, something that Randy hates. Ellie Gerber shines as Wendy, the adorable girl next door.I admit I had several LOL moments. For instance in one scene, Chevy Chase asks, ""What makes a great movie?"" Jennifer Sciole replies, ""Paris Hilton."" There were however more scenes that didn't work than those that did. Many of the spoofs were simply not funny.No sex, no nudity, I don't recall any f-bombs. Some minor sex talk, but this is not a sex comedy. Burt Reynolds and Michael Madsen are in limited roles."
1,"Do buy it, don't rent it",Do not spend your money on this because you will not spend the time to watch it.It is bad acting in the highest form.Very boring
1,made me want to watch Jaws 4,"This was a horrible movie experience. The acting of the main character alone is cringe worthy,and the production values aren't anything special either. Who wrote this? A monkey with a hangover? There's not a single funny thing here,with the exception of the 'Titanic' spoof that lasts too long anyway,and a few short Chevy Chase pop ups. I bought this movie because i'm a Chevy fanatic and i still regret spending the measly $10. So why did it make me want to watch Jaws 4? Simply put..there's not a laugh to dignify this comedy being made,and the serious thriller that is Jaws; The Revenge has PLENTY of side splitting qualities.If you can find it for a penny on dvd,go for it..at least you'll have a spare case..."
4,pretty funny,"This movie wasn't a spoof, more of a mocumentary like the office with spoof moments. I actually found myself laughing quite a bit. They did a good job for an indie movie. Chevy chase always makes me laugh, but I was surprised to find myself laughing a lot at the more unknown actors. The guy who plays Randy, David Schultz, (the PA) in the film was genuinely great and very funny. It's worth checking it out."
4,Great game,"I bought this game about two years ago for my son, who was eight years old at the time. He liked playing with this a lot, and still does every now and then (he's 10 now).The cards that come with the game have two sides. One side shows the pictures without the outlines of the game pieces, and the other side shows ""hints"" to make it easier for younger players to get started with the pattern.It's challenging, yet not too hard for kids to play this. The age category this game is sold in is definitely appropriate. The game helps with spatial relationship concepts and conceptual thinking.I would buy it again."
5,One of the Best Thinkfun Games,"This toy is a great toy for many ages, even adults can like it. It also includes 60 Puzzles, unlike many other Thinkfun Toys include 40."
4,So hard my brain is sore,You just have to love an engaging activity that involves a small handful of simple shapes. The only complaint I have is that these puzzles are hard - really hard.
5,fun that makes you think,"I got this game for my 10 year old daughter because of 2 reasons. First, sometimes she wants to play games when no one else does. This game is something she can do on her own, or everyone can take turns. The other reason is to help her learn to think things through this is a great educational toy - you have to think not only about what you are doing now but what your next move will be. I really recommend this not just for the fun but for the education value as well - this is both of those and just makes for hours of fun."
5,"Great travelling game, keep you entertained for hours","This is a great game. Nicely packed in a box and easy to carry around (albeit a little bit of weight). This is good to take travelling to occupy those hours on the plane.I ended up letting my 5 year old niece play it when I got home from holidays. She uses the answer card to identify the shapes and put it together. For a 5 year old, thats quite a challenge, and its a lot better than video games."
1,"Flimsy, poor quality camera","This camera is a horrible camera! It is the size of a credit card is is poorly designed. The structure is made entirely out of plastic -- I felt as if I were going to break it if I put it in my pocket. The image quality on the camera was sub par, and the image on the viewfinder was terrible. In order to zoom in, you have to go through the menu. There are WAY better cameras that are at the same price range. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Perfect for beginners,"Be advised that, assuming I was shipped the right camera, the picture on this page is slightly wrong. My camera doesn't have a manual viewfinder or lights along the top. Moving on, this camera is perfect for stashing in a purse in case something memorable comes along. It's smaller than a pack of cards, rechargeable, has all the basics (flash, zoom) and, to my delight, has a feature that prevents taking pictures of my pocket. Sure, there isn't a flash button, but switching takes literally 4 seconds and then you can choose auto flash. I took off one star simply because it only charges through a USB port, which can be a problem when travelling. I definitely recommend this camera to someone who wants a reliable camera but admits they're not a photographer."
2,There are better cameras for just a few dollars more.,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. I thought it would be a good, first ""real"" camera for my 13-year-old. The view in the LCD screen was grainy. The flash washed out any photo taken at a fairly close range. The camera kept shutting off after about 20-30 pictures (could have been bad batteries that came with the camera). Half the pictures came out pretty good, but half were dark and grainy, even at the best setting. We returned this camera and paid a little more to get a 5mp camera (Fujifilm FinePix A500) with a lot more features."
1,Primal Quest,"I'm sorry I purchased this item. They have started to do too many interviews and too much talking and not enough about the actual quest. I know Amazon cannot do anything about this, but to other customers do not buy this item."
2,disappointed by the size of this product,"I was so looking forward to this product after I hit the place the order button, but after I received the package I was very disappointed. The reason why I bought it is because my 3-yr old loves dinasaurs, so I thought this might be a fun activity for him, I bought two because I want to give one as a gift to my son's best friend. Once I got it, i realized how small the whole package is, it's about 5X7 size, not even the normal letter size,which makes me wondering it's gonna be hard to do origami dinasaurs on such small paper, I would expect this at least the letter size. I haven't really do the origami yet, will update the review after we do it together some time later."
5,Simply Loved it!,"This book made me cry so much! I could read this book over and over and never get bored! It's really a book you can't put down.I say it would make a really great movie.It shows her love for her brother and her horse.Though naughty at first she learns that people out there aren't as lucky as she.Simply loved it, i recemended this book for any age.I'm sure you'll love it too!"
5,Very versitile pump,"This pump appears to be adaptable to almost any installation. I have a small water fall and my unidentifiable pump went out. I chose the larger pump knowing I could adjust it down. However, it was the same volume as the OEM pump. So, be sure to oversize."
1,Don't buy for aquariums,I bought this to replace the pump in a 12gal saltwater aquarium because the one in the tank had gone bad but this one started making awful noises within just a couple of months and I've already replaced it. I also expected it to be stronger in such a small tank but the flow was really weak.
5,EXCELLENT,"WE LOVE IT, ITS EVEN BETTER THEN EXPECTED...!!! THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT , WE WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO FRIENDS & FAMILY..! WE ARE VERY PLEASED...!!!!!!!!"
1,book not what I ordered,"This book was touted as new. Shipping was as much as the book itself. Book came in the mail. edges are worn and it has the 'read"" look to it. I am VERY disappointed a sthis was for a birthday present."
5,My 2 year old Nephew LOVES this book,"We bought it for him for his 2nd birthday and he loves to ""read"" it over and over. Very cute for any little one who loves Thomas."
5,Share your child's birthday with Thomas!,"This is a great book and was lots of fun at our three-year-old's birthday party. In the story, Thomas thinks everyone forgot his birthday but he ends up with a surprise party. Now my nephew thinks he and Thomas share the same birthday!Sturdy, colorful- good buy."
1,Was charged & delivered a product I did not order,I did a search on Amazon for a Thomas book and went to check out to see how much delivery would be. Given delivery was double the price of the book I closed out of Amazon. I did not confirm the payment but somehow payment was charged to my credit card and this book was delivered to me. Understandably I am not happy this happened but given it only cost $14.98 I didn't bother contacting Amazon. It just wasn't worth it.
2,very soft erotic movie,"I spent more money on this movie than I should have. It was very soft porn with lots of simulated sex scenes. Yes, there was a story line, but it didn't impress me. I felt no excitement after viewing this movie and intend on selling it to another viewer."
2,Save your money,They look cheap and get dirty fast no matter what. Dust sticks to the rubber and it just isn't worth the purchase. They tare easily.
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately these towels did not live up to their description. When I took them out of the package, there were many loops that were already unravelled. They were also quite thin for supposedly plush towels."
1,Stole the name?,"If this is the group's first release, they stole their name from one of independent hip-hop's best artists who put out his first release, Up to Speed, with Greenhouse Effect in 1999. I doubt it was intentional, but regardless, if you all are reading this, CHANGE THE NAME!"
1,wuss rock not hip hop,"Not the Blueprint I was expecting. I wish there was something to differentiate between the two. If you are looking for the Blueprint that is half of Soul Position, keep looking. Bummed"
1,Not 12 AWG gauge wire,This wire is saying that it is 12 gauge wire. It is not even 14 gauge wire. The wire looks like it is pure copper so on that aspect you are getting what you paid for. It is just smaller than what you are paying for.
3,Nut and Peanut Allergy,"Does anyone know where I can find an allergen statement for Iron Chef Teriyaki, Plum or Hoisin sauces? Or a customer service email address? I have severe nut allergies but need to be able to cook Asian food at home. To do that I need a few nut safe sauces!"
4,Unparalleled,"While Reggae begat Dub, I am more intrigued by the latter. Such craftsmanship as The Luge Sessions - Hard End reinforces this. What's more, this premier album is yet without peer; It makes me want to hear more and so keeps me coming back. The songs are individually designed and have varying moods and tacts, yet are cohesive. It is apparent that they've all been molded by the same skilled hands. Minute sound loops underscore the prevalent score, giving the songs layered richness. Yes, I've heard this ilk of statement of other albums, but this is the only time I've ever really understood them - thanks to O'Luge."
3,Failed to perform as well as another,"I just bought this Aquatics Infinity and aSunterra 109006 Small Fountain Pump, 75 GPH, Black. Both are adjustable to 75 gph and both are about the same price, shipping free with Amazon Prime. This Sunterra outperformed the Aquatics Infinity by 50% in our kitchen sink.STI AQUATICS INFINITY- 16 seconds to fill a pint sized mug- A little quieter than the Aquatics Infinity- Adjustable dial was loose, giving the impression that it could change position while in use.SUNTERRA:- 11 seconds to fill a pint sized mug- A little more noisy than the Aquatics Infinity- Adjustable dial was more solid.Both were about the same size. The Sunterra also pushed out a slightly higher stream, perhaps 5 inches rather than 4."
5,good quiet little pump,"Good quiet little pump - extremely quiet. You rotate the yellow disk to adjust flow rate. Meant to sit on the little suction cups on the bottom, with water intake is right above that. We had to install it on its side (too tall to fit as mfg intends), but it seems to work ok - just keep water level above water intake. Make sure that this pump's flow rate is adequate for what you want. It was perfect for our small water fountain."
3,Extremely Tight Fit For P226 with Standard Rail,Was one day late on shipping. The product is very well constructed looks like it was made to last. Only complaint is that it is EXTREMELY tight fit for Sig P226 with standard rail NOT picatiny. I am still in the process of breaking it in. I ended up buying EZ draw to help break in the leather.
4,Great DVDS Player/Recorder,"Deliver was as forecast by Amazon.This replaced my previous Tobshiba VCR and DVD player. Operation was integrated and much simpler than with the previous two pieces of equipment. Installation was almost nothing. Plugged it in as described in the summary sheet, turned it on, and all worked without a problem."
4,Nice Affordable Player,"This has been the perfect solution for us. I needed to replace an older model VCR/DVD combo player that died and this has been a great replacement. Yes, there is no tuner, but we do not need one for playing DVD and VHS tapes on my daughters television. The packaging and all other info on this unit clearly states there is no tuner so I do not understand some folks confusion there. The remote works just fine no issues and playback quality has been wonderfull. It would be nice if the VHS and DVD could both be hooked up through S-video, but this is a minor issue and if you read the specs before purchasing you know this. All in all this has been a great unit for the inexpensive price. If all you need is something low tech to play your VHS tapes and DVDs on a non-HDTV then I would recommend this unit."
4,Toshiba SD-V295KU,"I purchased mine today at Best Buy, and YES it does not have a tuner built into the unit. The Best Buy price sticker indicates this as well as the outside of the unit does. It works great once one reads the manual which is actually very helpful, not to mention in perfect English also."
2,Cannot record and watch TV at the same time,"I bought this to record programs from TV/Cable to watch later. You have to remember to set the Timer Record button and cannot watch TV until the show has been recorded. Or you can undo the Timer Record button, watch another program, them remember to set the Timer Record button when you are finished. Very inconvenient.You can, however, watch a DVD while your VCR is set in Record Mode/Prepare to Record Mode! Unfortunately this does not work well with me."
4,Poor quality,"The thing did well for a while. It has no tuner, but you can run cables from other places. The dvd player often stops in the middle of the movie and no way can I restart it. Other times, it displays just snow. I thought it was a bad dvd but the disk works fine on other players. Toshiba had problems with this a while back, but it is still junk. This will be my last Toshiba product."
1,Do not buy,"Purchased from Amazon thru third party 6ave.com. After less than 4 months of use, it ""ate"" one of my VCR tapes (could not eject it). Since the warantee is for 90 days only, I am out the full purchase price. 6th Avenue does not consider unusual circumstances - only the miniscule manafacturer warantee. Do not buy the SD-V295KU DVD Video Player & Video Cassette Recorder!!!!!!!!"
1,blurred picture in both vcr and dvd modes,"This unit outputs blurred and faintly colored video in both vcr and dvd modes, had to return back for a full refund. My 10 year old Mitsubishi that this was supposed to replace was outputting perfect picture on the same setup. Highly unrecommended, what a disappointment in Toshiba."
1,Stay Away,"DO NOT buy this machine. I purchased mine at Best Buy in late July, watched exactly one DVD on it, and now it won't play anything, anywhere, anytime. I tried resetting it, hooking it to 3 different TV's, hooking it through different cables, and nothing. The display counter goes to 00:01 on both the DVD and VHS sides, and that's it, nada. Toshiba only has a 90 day warranty, and since we don't watch many movies, I'm SOL. Doubt if Best Buy will do anything either. Total garbage"
2,Arrived DOA,"I bought this through Amazon as a Mother's Day gift, drove clear across town once I got it, and set it up only to find out that the VCR side wouldn't work. It would load a tape, but not play it, fast forward, rewind, or anything. Toshiba's support phone number was entirely useless as it was just a recording saying to use the web. Not wanting the hassle of trying to return the item and being at least a little technically inclined, I got the courage to open the case and look inside hoping not to leave any evidence that would void the warranty. Once open it was clear that the unit was not fully engaging the tape to the tape head. A quick inspection showed that a bracket had been bounced out of place during shipment which was jamming the tape loading mechanism and so I was able to return it back to where it was supposed to be. That did the trick and the unit now works fine. Most anyone else would have had to return it or have it repaired."
2,Its not clear this unit requires an external tuner to record,"Its not clear, until you recived this unit, that it reqruies an external tuner to record from tv. This should be clearly noted in the ads for this product."
3,it's all good,"this dvd/vcr it's alright i guess, with it not having a cable hook up in the back the only way you can record any tv programs is to use your auxiliary hook up on your tv but it does play real good but you have to make sure that you have that timer button on or you will not get anything you can programs how many programs you want but if you don't hit that timer button you will not get anything but like any other new thing you buy you have to get use to it right ? but all around once you get use to it you'll love it i do really like it alot now"
2,Expensive Gimmick Box,"After reading the Chili Systems description of this do-it-all unit, I had to have it. I was disappointed to find sketchy instructions and a basically closed system that won't even function as a basic web server. Tech support can't even figure out how to adjust the NAT and firewall for remote desktop and other web access functions. Local technicians are available in about 6 of 50 states. Not good if your business depends on this thing working. The Chilibox is just a simple, limited feature Linux box in a pretty package. You would be much better off taking any junker PC and loading up a version of freeBSD (available anywhere online... for free). You will have a newer version of a fully functioning web server, firewall, DHCP, file server, mail server, etc. Actually, that's what I'm going to do right now."
4,Good but small size,"I liked this book, the photos are lovely and the text is nice, only the size is bad."
2,disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""surrender to a stranger"" so i was looking forward to reading this book. i was very disappointed b/c the dialogue between the characters (esp. between the mackillion clan) was silly and seemed wasteful. i was so bored and wished that the pages weren't so wasted. i dont understand the attraction between the protagonists either. one is super old and the lead male (roarke) doenst seem to mourn the passing of his wife and child. the leader of the clan is made out to seem evil but that is waht all lairds did back in those times. i think that this book is definitley skippable."
2,The Rose & The Warrior -- burned out...,"I took a chance on this book (given the mixed reviews) but since other Karyn Monk books had received accolades, why not? I have never not finished a book, until now. I just can't do it! Things happened too quickly and didn't make sense as to why. Melantha's clan too readily accepted warriors from an enemy clan, who had just raided and destroyed the majority of their village not two weeks prior, regardless that these men did not participate. I know that romance novels don't necessarily follow the ""rules"" as it is for how people would react in a given century, but that was ridiculous. If you were part of an enemy clan, then you were also an enemy. For crying out loud, at least have Roarke save her brother BEFORE they think that he might be an okay kind of a guy! If you want to read this book, please do, but be forewarned.. look for it at the library before you spend $7 on it... What I want to know is can I get a refund???"
4,Very Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the characters and enjoyed the humor which was throughout the whole book - especially the exchanges with Magnus and Thor. I know I wouldn't mind being conquered by any of the four warriors, Roarke, Myles, Erik or Donald. This book has been put on the ""keeper"" shelf and I'm looking forward to reading her others."
5,exactly as described,awesome product...I wanted to frame my own wall and not use some cheap wall kit from the box stores. This did the job great..I was able to hang a heavy antique door that is original to my 100 year old home and it looks and works great.
1,Don't pay more than the cover price of this book - there are other books out there with more up-to-date info!,"I just received a copy of this book & had I known that the original price was just $17.95, I would not have paid so much money. Not only is this book overpriced, it is dated. Although there is some good information in this book, alot has happened since 2002 & there are better resources out there that are more current & don't cost a small fortune.Buy the e-copy, or get something more current with just as much information like 'Issues in Internet Law'($17.71)"
3,why is Stravinsky cut into gnarly pieces?,"The 3 stars in my review is an average of 5 stars for the work and 0 stars for the way Amazon or whoever creates their download mangled the music files.I've long been looking for a copy of the Stravinsky -- I had a recording of it that went missing many years ago. It is a marvelous and exciting rendition, but I made the mistake of buying the download, which inexplicably slices the work into segments and thereby destroys much of the flow. Perhaps this happens to all classical music but it really is a travesty that could be avoided easily if the preparation and pricing of the MP3 files were done with a bit of care rather than by what appears to be thoughtless automation. I seriously advise avoiding the download -- the material I received is virtually useless for me. I will try to knock on Amazon's door about this but I am not expecting any response from them."
2,Old package dried up before use,"I can't find these on store shelves anymore, but I was thrilled when I found an unopened box in my closet. I used one and it didn't work because it was almost dried out. I tried a second one - same story. Be sure you're buying fresh product and not something that's been sitting around on store shelves for years because I think they stopped making these quite a while ago."
1,dont buy this product,this item is horrible! It is flimsy and didn't even come with any instructions. Even though it was so cheap I feel so ripped off
1,broken in 72 hours,"Terrible. Bought two, they were so cheap, but they are both broken, and I'm just waiting for my name brand controller. Save your money. Avoid this garbage."
2,Calmini sponsored book?,"Come on! This book seens to be sponsored by Calmini.But in general, good information for dummies and nice pictures."
3,Kind of cruel if you think about it =(,"I thought this would be great fun for my ferrets but if you don't give them the treat inside after awhile, it is kind of cruel (Neh, neh!! You can't get the treat!!!!). This is an interesting concept but don't leave your fuzzies alone with it without giving them their treats!!!"
5,Puccini: Turandot,"This was a performance I had seen in HD at the movies. I had also seen live performances of this production of Turandot at the Met. Because of the Zefferelli staging, this is one of the most opulent and exciting productions extant."
4,Terrific for the money,"I just got this cart. I was looking for a push cart that would transport easily, but not be a hassle when using. My cart maintained a straight line when pushing and folds up to a small enough size that I can put in the truck of my Accord without having to remove the bag. Getting the bag on the cart was easy, so even if I had to remove the bag from the cart I'm not concerned. Don't know about durability yet, only time will tell for that."
5,Happy hubby!,"This golf cart is a good value. It is lightweight, easy to fold up and to push. It might not be durable enough for the ""everyday"" golfer but for the 2-or-3 times a week guy, it works well. And the free shipping with Amazon always a ""plus."""
4,Intech golf cart,These golf carts are great. Very light weight yet sturdy at the same time. An incredible value.
2,cheap cheap cheap,"Exceptionally disappointed in this product. First the assembly instructions are absolutley horrible, and second it was broken coming out of the box. I dont know how it is possible to break 4 rivets (where the 'landing gear' attaches to the frame) inside the box. The only explanation is that the quality is substandard or there is no quality control at the factory before packaging. Now I know why it is the only 3 wheeled cart for $60... I am sending it back and spending more money on a better product."
2,tri-trac3 poorly made,center wheel pulls to the left on both our carts. water bottles are very cheaply made. the pullup part cannot stay up and is worthless
4,Love it,"Got this for Christmas and now walk instead of ride and this product really makes playing golf enjoyable for me and really getting that much needed exercise. The wheels are great and very sturdy, love it would recommend it to others for a cart under $50.00"
4,fair value,"fair value for the price, stable design , easy to fold/unfold. Only critic is the missing brake."
3,IntechTriTrac,The IntechTriTrac 3-wheel Pull Golf Cart pulls to the right ALL the time. The fork is probably machined wrong. I have reversed the front wheel and it continues to pull to the right. This defect makes the cart not worth the $65.00 I paid.
3,Good cart for the Money,Very good cart for the money. Product Support from the Manufacturer was very good.they sent me a new wheel because it was pulling to the the right. Works fine now if only my Golf Game was as good.
4,golf cart,very light and easy to push around the golf course. have a bad back and this unit is easy to push. only one problem is the lack of a brake.you must strategically position your cart or watch it run away
3,Golf Cart,The golf cart operates as intended. There's not much more to be expected.The parts fit rather well with one exception: the front wheel is slightly off centercausing needed corrections when in use.
4,Pleasant Surprise,Have only had the cart out on the course once but am very impressed. Pulls/pushs with ease & although some of the reviews have complained about the alignment of the front wheel I didn't have any problems. I was a bit concerned about the fact that the Cart had no brakes but found I had no problems just had to be aware. It is a handsome looking product easy to assemble.
3,Rico Grand Concert Select Alto Sax Reeds (2.5) Not For Me,"Gave the Rico Grand Concert Select Alto Sax Reeds a try, but was disappointed. They lacked the life/brightness that I like. I found the sound a bit flat and soggy. Going back to my Van Doren V12s."
3,Only Videos from the album Azul,"When you read the message ""en grande"" you think you will find a differet videos or live performance from Critian. This DVD only has 8 videos: Si tu me amaras, lo mejor de mi, lloran las rosas, volver a amar, mi vida sin tu amor, yo queria, azul and lloviendo estrellas. There are three behind the scenes of the videos, but is not worth. I think the title must be changed to Azul."
4,the sunshines once again for Gareth,Hay if you r a Gareth fan they you all will love the cd singe.. its purely briliant the song Sunshine just has a happy feel and just a good vibe.. I would say it is a must for all Gaz fanz
4,Emotional and gripping,"A remarkable deep CD. If you like female vocals, interesting instrumentation, and dramatic delivery, try this CD. Special guest appearance by George Winston on the last song."
4,the cutters,i love miss aldrich's writings and this book was no exception. she has a wonderful way of bringing her families to life.
2,box of disappointment,"I bought this for my daughter and she really liked the idea of it, but it never really worked very well. Often times, Jack would pop out the box without warning and getting him back in was always a hassle. The clip is supposed to hold him inside when the song ends, but it didn't alawys secure Jack in the box. Eventually, the clip broke and fell in the box and now Jack is permanently out the box. I contacted the manufacturer because I thought we may have rec'd a defective model, but they ignored me. My daughter is not rough with her toys at all- she takes very good care of them , so I have to assume this is a cheap toy and a waste of money."
4,great old fashioned toy,Could not find this toy anywhere else. My one yr old grandson loves it. Needs help turning the crank.
4,Works but poor packaging,"The toy works well with the clown poppong at the beginning of the ""pop goes the weasel"" part of the tune. The packaging, however, is poor with a little bit of cardboard enclosing the bottom 2"" of the metal box. The rest is covered by thin bubble wrap. The first one I ordered cam dented because of the poor packaging. I was luck on the second came even though the packaging was the same. Amazon should do a better job of stablizing a fragile item like this when shipping."
4,good traditional toy,"I ordered this for my 5 year old's birthday. I was surprised that was what she wanted for her birthday, but she and her 3 yr old brother love it. She has had it for about a week, so I can't speak to durability or how long it will keep the kids entertained. It is a good, traditional Jack-in-the-Box and it looks nice. The 5 year old can figure out how to put the Jack back in, but the (barely) 3 yr old hasn't figured it out yet. It seems a little expensive but I didn't find any better options. The package arrived sooner than predicted (like usual for Amazon)."
1,pop goes the dud!,"I was very disappointed with this product. The jester popped out when it felt like it (the latch wouldn't release)and it arrived nice and dented.Beware...they add insult to injury by having YOU PAY shipping to return a defective product!oh, it gets one star for being in stock and the color."
4,Fun toy,I have a 3 year and 1.5 year old. Both love to play with the toy. The 1.5 year old does not like to do the hardwork of turning the lever for the jack to pop out - so she just pulls the red clip on top which makes the jack to pop out- Clever ;-)Toy is a lot of fun (at least for the first few weeks) and my 3 year old had no problems with putting the jack back in the box.
3,Traditional Jester Jack in a Box,Purchased this for my 2 year old grandson. It is cute and works well-- but has a flimsy metal box and must be used with adult supervision. He loves it-- it is a replica of an old-fashioned Jack in a Box.
4,"Nice, but not a lot of fun","This product is nicely made, but my 16-month old quickly figured out how the rather obvious latch mechanism worked, and would just pop the jester without turning the handle.Nicely made, but still needs a bit or work."
4,Schyling Jack-In-the-Box,This was such a surprise to my Grandchild. He was so excited finding the clown jumping out of the box.
4,Original looks,"Looks, acts, and plays like the old jack in the boxes. Was a real hit with the kids at Christmas."
4,Glad I bought it,"My daughter seems to love the element of surprise so I thought this would be a good toy. It was a first birthday gift. She points at it all the time so that I will take it off the shelf. We have to play with it together right now - her little hands can't quite handle it yet. She loves trying to stuff Jack back in the box. She gets impatient for him to pop up, so it is teaching her to wait for her reward! This toy is well made and will be one that we don't get rid of for a long time since it is a ""classic"" and not just the usual plastic junk."
4,Just What I Wanted,"Purchased this for use in story times--Jack is cute and smiling, so not intimidating or frightening; item is durable and should entertain generations of toddlers!"
5,"fun, cute, not haunted!","Santa brought this for our newly two year old son. He LOVES it. He can crank and close it most of the time with out any problems, I do have to remind him which way to turn it sometimes.We have not found it any where we didn't leave it and have never had it pop up in our face in the middle of the night, so to the felow with these problems perhaps you either 1.) need not watch IT any more or 2.) investigate if your house was built on any indian grave yards.If you want your kids to enjoy an old beloved toy then well buy buy buy."
2,"Lots of fun for all ages, needs a bit of help from mom though","I bought this for my 1 year old, not really paying attention to the age suggestion. It is NOT appropriate for a one year old. My 3 and 5 year old love it and my 1 year old does enjoy watching it. It needs to have the song finish before Jack can go back down which is frustrating for kids until they understand what that means. I have seen some of the paint chip and the edges of the box have a few dents already. For the price everyone is listing it for, they're ripping you off. For the price I paid ($3.99), it's a good buy.EDIT: Ours died in late summer. It just stopped working. No music, no popping up. Nothing. I am so glad I didn't pay full price for this. Maybe we got a bum toy but as far as I'm concerned, between the paint chipping and it breaking, it is pretty much a cheap toy. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great toy.,"Bang for the buck. My 2 year old loves this. As the other reviews suggest, the closing is a bit trickly for little ones, but over all it's fantastic value. My kid uses this a lot."
4,COBBLERS BENCH,MY 2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES THIS TOY. HE LEARNED QUICKLY HOW TO TURN THE HANDLE SO JACK WILL POP UP AND HE WAS EXCITED. IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO STUFF HIM BACK IN BUT ALL IN ALL IT IS A GREAT TOY.
4,Fun Toy,"For some reason my eight year old grandson wanted a Jack-in-the-Box. He also has a younger sister whom he adores of almost 2. He was delighted when we got this box and played with it quite a bit, especially with his sister. I suppose the only down side is that, though the latch is strong for the top, it doesn't appear to be, so one is not always sure that it is latched well.Since we also have a puppy German Shepherd who is teething, we have to watch out for the puppet in the box when we aren't around, so it is placed very high up. That prevents them from playing as much as they would if it were in view and easier to get to. When the puppy is an adult, I have every expectation that this will be a loved toy again, especially for the baby."
3,a new jack-in-the-box,it's ok for now a days. I understand why but i do miss the big bang that jack used to have coming out!
4,Great toy for toddlers,We love this toy for infants to toddlers. We brought it for our son when he was around 15 months old and he still loves to play with it once in a while. My younger daughter was introduced to it around 8 months old and she likes it a lot as well. This is a must have classical toy that everyone should have. I recently purchased one for a friend's son turning 1 and she likes it very much as well.
2,Jack in the Box Junk,I purchased this product for a grand-daughter for x-mas. We tried the product upon receiving. There were 4 adults trying to get this thing to work and could only get it to work about every 8th time. Not Impressed!!!!
4,Great Fun Toy!,"Recently my grand daughter had her 2nd birthday party. She and the other children were amazed and delighted by ""Jack-In-The-Box"". It was her favorite new toy and just the right size to carry. Many of the adults were surprised, also, that it can be purchased now a days. It is definetly well worth the money."
4,My son loves it!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and is now 14mo old. He loves it and out of all the toys he received this is the toy he hunts down to play with. I will tell you that with just a few turns of the handle after the clown pops out you and hear the latch click back into place so you can close the lid. My son is to young to do it but my almost 3yr old has figured it out. All my small children 6yr, 3yr, and 14 months play with this toy all the time. It was a good choice."
3,Good for parents and kids,"Jack in the Box is a great toy for older children or for parents and kids to do together. My 18 month old cannot turn the handle in the correct direction and gets easily frustrated that ""Jack"" doesn't pop out! But when we do it together or my older son does it with her she laughs and loves to play with this toy."
3,Love it and leave it,"This is a great toy...for a small amount of time. After a minute or two my son gets bored of it because it only does one thing and only plays one tune. Not great for younger kids because jack is hard to get back into the box and I think the young ones will have a hard time (sometimes I have a hard time...lol). Not worth the money I spent on it, but still a fun toy...and a classic."
3,"Classic toy, but hard for kids to close.","Kids like this toy but get frustrated when they can't close it... and then parents are constantly being asked to help them ""make it work."""
5,Jester Jack in the Box,"I was delighted (after searching all toy stores in my area) to find the Jester Jack In the Box. It arrived in perfect condition and works just like I remember as a little girl! I couldn't belive the only place I was able to find this toy was through Amazon. It was worth every penny. Though my Grand daughter is too young to operate it, she squeals with delight when the silly Jester pops up! We get enjoyment watching her enjoy a truly classic toy!"
2,Returned to Amazon,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. After testing the product once or twice, the top would not close and the music reduced to a slow drag. This product was returned."
2,"cute,but not durable","The cuteness factor was certainly there. My grandchild was thrilled to have it, however it lasted 1 day. The plastic clip that holds the lid down completely came off shortly after playing with it. Since this toy appeals to young children I would have expected it to be more durable."
3,So-so fantasy.,"This is an interesting fantasy movie about five men dropped on a desert island during the civil war. It very loosely based on Jules Vernes masterpiece, very loosely. Lots of monsters and women which were not in the book. You might enjoy the movie, but if you want to know the real story, you have to read the book - that will be well worth your time. I wish that someone would produce a movie that really tells the whole story as Verne wrote it; I'd buy that in an instant."
5,Magnificent Island,"1961,and the production values plus high action score are unsurpassed. This is indeed one example of special effect stop motion effect master Harryhausen at his best, and most esteemed. Bernard Herrmann yet again matches the Ray Harryhausen action with masterful score. Island locations are equally splendid, and fine cast by all. A must for science fiction action fans."
5,Mysterious Island,"Great storyline, awsome music, survivors, monsters, and a volcano. What more can this classic adventure need? Great for kids and adults alike."
3,Entertaining,"This movie comes from an era 1961 which I have never seen anything from. As a result, all the actors were new to me.The acting was I thought was ordinary except Joan Greenwood who I thought played well. I am surprised I have not heard more about her.However, none of the characters impressed me as interesting, I am not sure whether it was because of the script or just the ordinary acting.The script itself was ordinary, which surprises me as Jules Verne normally makes a very good story. I suspect the screen play does not do it justice. So while watching it, I thought it was a shame that as a kid, I missed reading his book as I am sure I would have enjoyed it like so many other Jules Verne's book.The graphics were probably very good at the time, but technology has moved on so it does not compare with what we have today.The action scenes, I did not think were very exciting.I would not see it again, but I would recommend it for children."
5,Mysterious Island,"Great action/fantasy adventure story written by Jules Verne. Several people are standed on an Island that has a gaint bird, crab, bees, clams and vegetation. How did they get there? How do they get off the island? Boy and girls ages 8+ will love this movie and dream of their own Mysterious Island and what they would created and how they would survive. It has a light hearted love story too! But it has lots of actions to keep the story line moving along and yet it also has a moral to the story and makes you think what can I do to help mankind and our plant. It makes you think and encourages you to try and do something and it may help you choose a vocation in life that could make a difference."
4,It is NOT wide screen,"The movie is a 5. The fact that it's advertised as Wide Screen yet isn't is why I give this a 4. Mysterious Island is one of my favorite movies, but I've never seen it in wide screen. (I was grounded as a kid when it was at the movies ...) Anyway, I was excited to finally be able to see Mysterious Island in Wide Screen. It's advertised that way, states it's wide screen on the package, but trust me -- it isn't."
4,Good Fun!,"""Mysterious Island"", is really neat, I remember saying after seeing it on tv in 1965! Of course the book is better,(well almost, the film has Joan Greenwood and Beth Rogan, oh mama!). With an eye on the youth market casting has (as in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"")two young actors Michael Callan and Beth Rogan and two seasoned actors Joan Greenwood and Michael Craig. Notable British Director Cy Endfield,(Zulu) was on board and the excellent Ray Harryhausen was responsable for the amazing special effects, excellent for their time. Last but not least the part of Captain Nemo was played by the excellent Herbert Lom! The movie screenplay used the book as a point of departure, so don't read the book see the movie, no comparison. I love this movie as much as I did when I saw it ""a thousand years ago"", and especially because it is directed by Cy Endfield. If you love sci-fi do get a copy of this flick!"
1,Waste of time,"""Mysterious Island"" by Jules Verne is a fantastic book. The story is gripping and engaging, well-written, and a delight to experience. This movie is ridiculous. It barely follows the book at all, grafts in scenarios that are just ludicrous and personally, I find it an insult to Mr. Verne's work.If you're looking for a movie adaptation of the book, keep looking. If you want a ridiculous, fanciful sci-fi movie, this one is a sure bet."
3,Mysterious Island,Well made... however it was loosly based on Jules Verne's novel.Ray Harryhausen did a great job on his stop motion animation! Those who like strange-world movies... see it!
4,Good Family Adventure,"I remember this from my childhood watching ""Family Classics"" with host Frasier Thomas on WGN TV. It has some gripping adventure for the young--dodging giant animals and insects, submarines, a mysterious recluse, all while trying to escape an island as it is about to be destroyed by an erupting volcano. It doesn't plod along too badly, and it is well worth the price of admission."
2,Another Harryhausen DVD disappointment,"Finally got this DVD,and again I was disappointed with the less then great remaster of this movie. Just like the "" 7th Voyage Of Sinbad"" DVD, this one's soundtrack really let me down, especially when I had the vhs version where the picture and soundtrack was really remastered. The soundtrack on the vhs had a great surround sound quality, even though it never mentions it on the box cover,and this DVD sorely lacks this. Columbia Pictures really got sloppy with this like they did with ""7th Voyage"",and when they claim remastered in high definition sound and picture, and then its not,I think you should get your money back. The only reason I give it 2 stars is being in widescreen, and thats a shame as this is one of my favorite Harryhausen movies."
3,Mysterious Island,"Any Jules Verne or Ray Harryhausen fan should have a good time watching this movie. It's not "" 20,000 leagues Under the Sea "" or "" 7th Voyage of Sinbad "" , however...it's still fun fantasy."
4,solid family fun,"I've reviewed the VHS version of this movie, and the DVD doesn't add much, but the picture and sound are definitely clearer, and you get a short documentary about the making of the movie. You also get some other documentaries that seem to appear on all of the DVD's of Harryhausen movies, which would interest you more if this was the first such movie you had.It's a lot of fun, my kids especially like it, and they did a good job putting it on DVD."
2,WIDESCREEN WARNING...,"Warning before you buy!! This particular ""Widescreen"" version appears to be nothing more than 4:3 ""Zoomed"" (not the best term I agree) to 16:9, which results , for me anyway, in a terrible picture of, giant heads, and half bodies w/ most of the original movie chopped off...it DOES fill the screen however,...which seems to be the most important thing to 90% of viewers..."
5,A Ray Harryhausen / Bernard Herrmann classic!,Finally we are treated to another Harryhausen/Herrmann masterpiece. Many young folk consider stop-motion archaic. I see just the opposite and find that stop-motion gives more life-like character to the created entities. Mr. Herrmann's trademark haunting scores always guarantee chilling and enjoyable cinema.
3,Not Harryhausen's Finest But Close,"I was bitten by the nostalgia bug because this 1961 version, based on the Jules Verne classic novel (published in 1874) is only memorable for its stop-motion action sequences. It's got a solid cast with nothing to do but spout ridiculous dialog all at the service of bridging the wonderful Ray Harryhausen set pieces--my favorite being the chicken monster thing. The story moves along, painlessly and I was glad I bought the disc on Blu-ray. The quality of encoding preserves the colors as I remember them--even the heavy grain that signaled an animation sequence was arriving. This is not the best of the Harryhausen collection but will satisfy fans of the genre like yours truly."
1,mysterious dvd,for the first time in my life I was surprized to open an apparently sealed dvd case and found nothing inside!
1,Destruction of Jule Verne work,"Jule verne did not wrote action novels.They were essaies the dwelved into the science fiction of his time and in wich he often brough social or moral issues.To remove these aspect in this ""commercial"" film feels like the producer wanted to sell Vernes work as an action movie. The only pro I see is to encourage yougsters to read his book, wich I doub't they will by any account after having seen this film."
4,Mysterious Island,"One of the last Ray Harryhousen films to be released on DVD. Unfortunately a very grainy print. and the mono soundtrack is fair at best. Bernard Hermann's score in stereo is breathtaking but you won't here it on this DVD. That's unfortunate. Fair job of remastering on this one! However,The wide screen format is excellent. And the picture to this day is as entertaining as it was in 1961. Story and special effects are a treat!!! Fun and exciting to watch!"
2,Sounds like...,"There's a number of differences of opinions regarding the audio portion of this DVD. I own both the DVD and VHS versions of Mysterious Island, and can tell you that sonically the tape is superior, with Bernard Herrmann's score in stereo (as it was recorded). This is also true for the VHS version of The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. If the DVD of Sinbad is not up to the quality of the remastered tape (as another reviewer noted), then I'll not be in a rush to replace mine anytime soon. Thanks to the previous reviewers who noted this."
5,Amazing!,"What first attracted me to this was the cover. I wondered if anyone could make music that matched a cover like that! Or the title: ""In the Bloodlit Dark."" Can anyone make music to match a *title* like that?!Zoar's answer to both: Yes! This CD is amazing!Zoar is three instrumentalists: Michael Montes on keyboards (including mellotron on ""Child of God""), Peter Rundquist on electric and acoustic guitars, and Erik Friedlander on cello. Together, they are indeed ""masters of the cinematic instrumental."" More than that, these are soundtracks to horror movies not yet made--or maybe to your darkest nightmares. The compositions range from soaring Pink Floydian compositions (""Spiderlace,"" for example) to ambient-industrial sound sculptures (the title track, ""Ghosts and Molecules""). Imagine Pink Floyd as a Goth band, and you'll get a basic idea how this group sounds.Great listening for thunderstorms, dark rooms, and those dark corners of your mind ..."
5,Great deck,"A lot of people seem to have a problem with the colors. If you look carefully at the use of color, you will get a sense that it was purposefully used. For instance, the use of an orange background in the wands gave me a sense of the fire element of the Wands suit. The backs of the cards is a simple design but it has a nice off white with a gold sun in the middle that give it a nice classic stylish look. This is the drawing is the original Rider Waite, the only difference is the use of color. I recommend this deck and hope it remains available in case I wear out the one I have! Some people have their complaints about the use of color in this deck but it really is a great deck and the issues others find are truly miniscule!"
2,There's such a thing as too much color,"Although most people would agree that the original Rider-Waite colors are a bit bland, the Albano-Waite solution is actually worse: the colors are bright but often absurd and weird, making the cards clownish, garish and distracting (imagine pea green skies and a completely red Knight of Pentacles). As this is a facsimile, the colors bleed and often obliterate some of Pamela Colman Smith's details. The dark colors are especially brackish and cheap looking. A few cards have some colorful force to them (The High Priestess is quite striking) but if you're looking for a better version of the Waite-Smith cards, get the beauitful and finely detailed ""Universal Waite"" deck, with its attractive shades and depths."
1,Disappointed,I received this as a gift per my request.I was so disappointed once I opened it.Some colors are too dark and take away from the picture itself or there is a lot of color saturation that is distracting to the images and symbols.
2,I've never heard of an Albino Parrot,I don't really know what these guys below me are talking about. Maybe they all got together for Peach Schnopps one morning and made out while hashing their ideas out. Deck? I'll deck you!
4,seemed ok instruction book writing very small,The cards were a nice deep color. The backs on the cards were a tan color with a little box with a design.I didn't like the instruction book it was very small and the writing was too small to read.
3,Ana Leigh has a way with words!!,"The entire MacKenzie series has been wonderful. ( The new frasier series promises to also be great). MacKenzie's Zach is 3rd generation and he is a hunk(as they all are). The strength of this ""basic texas ranger western"" is the dialogue. Ana Leigh brings her characters to life and the stuff that comes out of their mouths is sometimes laugh out loud funny although a tad risque. I don't think Zach's story is as good as some of the others (ironically I didn't prefer the one about his father, Flint, either) perhaps because the plot was fairly standard but it was fun to read. And his redheaded, feisty flame, rose, is pretty unforgettable for her sassy speech. Cute, cute, cute. A feel-good historical romance, more on the romance(not explicit sex) and less on the historical side."
5,Great book...,This is a wonderful book! Love it... I read several days in a row because I didn't want to put it down.
4,Rustic Cedar Lounge,"Assembly was fairly easy - I did it without my husband's help. They are absolutely beautiful, and extraordinarily sturdy. We bought two for our dock. Heavy enough not to blow away, but light enough for me to move.My only complaint is that it doesn't lie down flat. The slats in the back hit the rails preventing it from going down all the way. My husband did help with this - he cut down the lower slats so they didn't hit the rails - YAY !!! The back lays flat enough to sit on as a bench (but still hits the end rail slightly)."
4,Soccer Ball,"When we purchased this ball we knew it would be a great assett for us however, when it arrived we had to use it immediately in a tournament which we won, it must be the ball."
5,mimi,Thinking in color and understanding color; the info in this book has really enhanced my understanding. The teaching on lighting tech really blew me away also! Great book for the beginner and the pro. Thanks Amazon!
4,RJ Helton,"I believe that RJ has really improved since he was on American Idol! He is a very talented singer, and puts feeling behind his songs. This album consists of mostly slow songs, but that's nice, considering that the songs have very good lyrics, and make you feel calm, rather then put unwanted pressure on you. After hearing this album, all I have to say is, ""Go, RJ!""."
5,Amazing!,"I'd like to first ask Nancy where all the negative reviews are for RJ. I haven't seen one negative review for this CD (I'm not talking about what people post on Amazon.com, I mean, REAL music business reviews). Everything I have seen has been positive...even Billboard. And by the way, he IS making a video for his first single, ""Even If"".But anyway, this CD is absolutely amazing. There isn't any way to describe it but amazing. You can't go wrong if you buy this CD. Even if you're not an RJ fan you should give it a try. I've convinced many a NON-RJ Fan to purchase this CD and they really enjoyed it. I suggest you go out and get your copy TODAY! Don't wait. hehe :)"
1,Don't bother...(yawn),"Vocals are weak, music is thin, lyrics are dull. Worst thing to come out of 'Americal Idol.'"
1,Nope... no growth here.,"Well, that was disappointing. Helton shows the same weaknesses he's always had: bland vocals, terrible phrasing, and awkward delivery. On top of those problems, the lyrics are pedestrian and the arrangements mediocre.Something is terribly wrong when the ""deer in the highlights"" presence Helton displayed on AI can actually be transporterd onto his album and clearly demonstrated through audio only."
1,FLOP,This album is an utter disaster. I can't believe that a record label actually thought he could sing. There is not one song on this album that could be a hit. No wonder this album is a complete flop!
3,Da Da Da,"There are a couple of good songs on ""Real Life."" ""Freedom"" boasts a driving beat that sets you immediately in motion, an excellent dance track. Helton's breathy vocals give him a sound like a slightly more masculine Michael Jackson. It's all about the feel, nothing deep here, ""Gotta hit that beat now yeah, ba da dat dat da da da."" ""Why Don't We Pray"" is another upbeat track that strikes a chord with anyone who has suffered through a difficult day, ""For the strength that it takes to make it through the day; Why don't we fall on our knees, know that He will meet our needs."" The rest of the material on the CD is standard boy-band product that has a certain dated appeal, but is already a bit out-of-style three years later. If you wax nostalgic for 2003, this set will hit the spot. Enjoy!"
5,Mariah who????,"Shoot, forget Mariah.... RJ is the next big thing. Sorry Mariah, I love you dear.... but it's coming to be your time up. And who's here to take your glorious place??? Mhmmm that's right.... RJ HELTON! We're sure going to miss you, but we're going to bask in the stupendousness that is RJ HElton for the next 20, 30 years. Well, I am atleast..... as I'm sure many of his other fans will. We're the most dedicated bunch of babes, isn't that the truth lol. We've been here for over 2 years, we're hardcore. Top THAT! Heh"
5,Simplement stupéfiant,"I am of France and I am on internet to find music and see RJ. I heard small samples of songs and am love. So much amazing voice. For French listeners,RJ Helton est stupéfiant. Nous n'avons pas l'Américain je dol ici en france mais j'ai fait chercher sur l'internet et l'ai trouvé et ai écouté sa musique et c'est vraiment bon. Il est est un homme magnifique et il est si très doué. J'ai entendu des échantillons des chansons et maintenant j'attends le CD pour entrer le courrier. Je le jouerai sans arrt! Je sais c'est stupéfiant. RJ Helton est un génie."
5,CAN WE SAY 'TOUCHDOWN'?!?!?,"Yes, indeed we can...... TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is beyond anything I expected from RJ. But I had heard clips of each song on a website and was REALLY impressed. I couldn't help myself and HAD to buy the CD the day it came out. I can't believe people would vote it anything less than 5 stars. They obviously did not listen to the CD and must be fans of other, less popular American Idol finalists. But you can't bring RJ down. He's got what it takes. And he's got a huge amazing fan base supporting him. Eat that, LOSERS!RJ HELTON IS TRUELY AMAZING!!!! BUY THIS CD!"
5,Never misses a beat,"You can't put the perfection of 'Real Life' into words. Just take my advice, this is the absolute best investment you could ever make. I would gladly have paid $100 for this, even more. THAT'S how good it is. Absolute creative genius."
4,"Good voice, and surprising twist to a gospel-themed label","Since the label was basically Gospocentric, a gospel-based label, the surprising twist was that the songs sounded strangely like contemporary love songs and ballads written for a Christian and non-Christian audience alike.Although RJ Helton may not enjoy the raving popularity of Clay Aiken, and the likes of Kelly Clarkson and so on, he does have a pleasing voice which if he develops in the course of time to include a greater range of performances, will be even more impressive.For a debut album effort, it is really much more refreshing than I expected it to be. Given that the themes governing a gospel-based label record are often about faith, love, healing, and emotional-spiritual recognition of the power of faith in God, this set of premises are very much the mainstay of the album and offer RJ Helton what he has to stay on as a singer."
5,All I can say is WOW,"I couldn't have asked for anything more in a CD. Everything about it is pure perfection. The lyrics, the music, the vocals, the way he delivers the lines.... it's all pure genius. He will EASILY surpass all competitors in his path. I'm so excited that everyone finally gets to hear what we've known to be true talent from the very beginning. Way to go, RJ!!"
5,An Artist Underated,R J Helton has a god given talent of a great voice. Unfortunately American Idol didn't promote him as they should have. I hope that one day he gets his just recognition that he is truly deserving of. I can't for his next CD to come out. I wish they would re-release this CD to give it more exposure.
1,Way better than Squeaky Idol's CD!,What's good about this album is that there's REAL singing of good songs. Very much unlike the all-squeaks-and-screams rendition of the cheesy songs in the overrated idol's CD whose sales didn't even come close to AI 2 runner-up Clay Aiken's figures.
5,Excellent debut CD for an Amazing Talent !!!,"RJ Helton is one of the most gifted and talented new voices to hit the music world in a very long time. Everyone knows he was absolutely the Most talented Man on American Idol season One. That was just the start,he has long passed everyone in talent and style that has ever been on American Idol. His vocal range and style is very impressive and his smooth move from one type and style of sound to the next is breath taking. I highly recommend this CD. If you appreciate Real talent and a beautiful voice you need this in your CD collection. He absolutely has the IT factor."
4,My mom loves this!,"The songs are I guess meant to be religious which is why this CD didn't get any airplay or really any notice at all, but my mother loved it because she said majority of the songs it sounded like he could be talking about a girl. I heard a little of it and I think he has a great voice and a cute look. Besides Nick Lachey can you honestly think of ONE cute singer in music that isn't alternative/rock? I didn't think so!! Certainly better than justin Timberlake which is the closest you could compare him to. R.J doesn't try too hard or do a lot of posing or reaching out for styles that make him look stupid vocally and physically. If he should ever go mainstream, I'd definitly cheer for him to win the awards over timberlake and usher. And BONUS -he's Spanish so he can rightfully do songs in Spanish, and really, who doesn't love a Hispanic guy?"
3,A Good First Effort,"Came across this while looking for NOW 15. Since I am a big American idols Fan, I do have all the CD's that's been released so far. Even the American Juniors CD. Anyway, after listening to RJ Helton's CD, I have to say that I am surprised. I was actually impressed with his vocals and song choices. Some upbeat and some slow. Overall, I would recommend this CD. It's a good first effort and hopefully he can continue. Since there was no publicity for this CD, I am sure you won't see it at the top of the charts which is too bad. I do believe that this CD is much better than Justin Guarini's. Justin's CD, I think, was too mature of a style for him. The song choices were all wrong and he wasn't being publicized properly. So on that note, buy RJ's CD, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Now all I'm waiting for is Kimberley Locke and Joshua Gracin to release their CD. Both their singles are terrific."
2,Mediocre,"Ok, I was an RJ fan during the 1st season of AI (he was my 3rd fave after Kelly and Tamyra) but the fact that this was a Christian Album did put me off at first, so I almost didn't buy it and now I kinda wish I hadn't wasted my money.The only good things I can say about it are that it isn't as preachy as I expected and that RJ has a pleasant voice.However, as pleasant as it is RJ's voice is boring, the lyrics are terrible and the arrangement on most of the songs is awful. I recommend that you listen to the samples before you buy otherwise you might end up as dissapointed as me."
5,MMMMMM,"It doesn't get any better than this. Creap of the crop. I'm in awe. I can't even describe to you how much this album has touched my life. What an inspiration. Pure genius. RJ deserves to be number one on every chart. Way to go, hun!"
5,Let's keep this streak going!,"Wow look @ all the amazing reviews for RJ!! Way to go, babe!! You deserve everything you set ytour heart to and so much more. You're blessed in so many ways and I hope and pray every single day that everything you want from this worl you recieve. You deserve it more than anyone I could ever think of. You're definately a star in our eyes, regardless of what these stupid Clay and Justin fans think. They're just jealous because they can see how much more amazing your material is. Hahaha losers. I love everything about you. You inspire me to be so much more than I could ever hope to be. You will never know the impact you have made on my life. I adore, admire and respect every aspect that makes up your being. Keep on dreamin, RJ.... I want to see everything else you can acheive when you put your heart and soul into it. Love you SO much, hun!Love, Jamie <3333333 ((L.A.)) ;) heh"
3,A little bit of every layer of RJ,"Hi! I was so excited to get this album because RJ is my favorite idol of all the seasons so far. I've seen him live before, but the songs he sang did not appeal to me because I expected him to sing ballads or pop songs... in this album, RJ gets down to his spiritual roots with some really touching love songs to God. Also, he has really put his emotions into the lyrics and his voice is of excellent quality. I only really listen to 3.5 of the songs on this album... That is not bad at all for a debut album... but if you are looking for an album that will be popular with your friends... this is probably not going to be one of them."
3,If this is REAL LIFE....then polish up your act !,"This CD is very confusing to identify, label and categorize. The rhythmns are solidly influenced by the ""Latin"" musical trend. However, the production values sound 1998ish (a moment in time when Ricky Martin was starting to peak on the charts). The vocal dubbing and multi layering of HELTON's vocals have RJ sounding as if he is auditioning for a COLOR ME BADD reunion tour. The CD is not bad; the material is stronger than anticipated. Yet I do believe this CD will go unnoticed (as did Justin Guarini). That being said, it's better than you'd imagine but not enough to make any significant impact on the Billboard charts. Word of advice would be to sample and audition the tracks before purchasing !"
2,"Real Life, maybe! But not Real Good!!!","I will make this brief.......the lyrics are one dimensional, the vocals are weak and not full of any sort of depth and the songs have a been there done that sound......this is another example of why he did not win American Idol 1. Great guy, so so singer and performer."
3,For a live album is a disapointment!,"I love Yolandita's music. I been collecting her cd's for a long time. I was waiting for a live album since ""Cara de angel"".When I heard the cd, the first thing I didnt like was the fact that a lot of songs that made her a ""Diva"" are not in this cd. The sound is not ""all that"", and there's a big error in the middle of the song ""como puedes"" there's people clapping out of nowhere! The other thing I wanted to mention is this cd should be called ""medley live"" or something; too many medleys in just one cd.I think she should have make a two cd set live album. Don't get me wrong I still love Yolandita the highlights of this cd are: ""Mala Sangre"" and ""Susususubir"". If you are a die hard fan you sould get it, if not just buy her full albums."
3,Good for what it is...,"If you imagine carrying a light tool bag because this is a multi-diameter tool, think twice. This tool is not for very tight nuts (it cannot hold them if the nuts are very tight), in general is way better than your own fingers but again, if the nut is solid tight it will not move it. Solution, get fixed measure drivers for whatever you face most times and keep this one as spare for the rest; remember, it works either in standard or metric. I inspected the tool, the technical concept is good but the holding teeth are not flat but rounded and that's what makes this tool fail."
3,On the fence,"I'm still on the fence with this product. I have only used it a couple of times and I wish I could get it to lock in better, but the idea is great."
1,not happy,"I thought you could count on Klein Tools for being a little pricey, but always a-one tools. After my experience with this tool I will not buy any Klein products that i cant check out first, simply not as advertised."
1,beware,I received the product in a sealed bottle that is half empty. Emails to the supplier go unanswered and NOW AMAZON tells me they are not responsible which is why i've spent thousands of dollars with them over the years. I am cancelling my AMAZON acct today and will refuse to do business with them in the future.
1,pheromone products are poor investments. Period.,"My conclusion. Artificial Pheromones don't seem to work with Humans. I have been trying and testing various products since 1986. BETA-androsteNOL is the most recent version that I purchased. I truly wish that I had saved my money. People that claim this stuff is miraculous and makes women more into them, well that's just wishful thinking and blatant self delusion... Plain and simple."
4,Review,"Excellent working with seller, but shipping was slow; should have told buyer how the item was being shipped and how long. Would recommend business with this seller."
3,Carry On Regardless/Carry On Cruising,"Haven't watched this DVD yet but if you are opening this DVD case just slice the factory seal open or you'll end up doing what I had to do: put the DVD in another plastic case because the label destroyed the clear plastic on the DVD case it was so stuck to it, possibly due to age."
3,YES IT'S 'BOOK 'EM' DANNO!!!!!!!!,"Movie wasn't totally bad or silly as some reviews say. It was after all a made for TV movie and budgets are lots lower then the theater blockbusters.The best part to me was seeing JAMES MAC ARTHUR. Not only from 'Book 'Em' Danno fame, but from all of his wonderful Disney and young adult films of my youth. I've always loved him and it was so great to see him on the screen again. Hawaii 5-0 was too long ago. James, your fans miss you.vannevel"
3,Excuse me if I giggle.,"I thought the movie was a little silly. Kelly McGillis gets into her maniac role pretty well. Is that Danno? Yes it is! Waiting for the tornadoes was tiresome, however. And yes, they do use the ""food coloring in a tank of water"" effects. Actually well written, and interesting just to listen to."
2,"Utter Nonsense, Poor Stroy Line, and Bad Acting","I thought this would be a good sequel to ""Twister."" Was I ever wrong! The story line was poorly conceived. The acting was just as bad. If you want to see an action-suspense movie featuring tornadoes -- and, you really don't care about ""realism;"" then I suggest you get the original ""Twister"" instead. Leave this one on the shelves."
4,A Solid Bio,"McMurry writes a solid bio of Hood in this book. McMurry traces the key turning points,in his mind, of Hood's career. In doing this he delves into the battle of Chickamauga, the Seven Days' Battles, the Atlanta Campaign, and the Tennessee Campaign of 1864, and Hood's courtship of Buck Preston while hardly mentioning the battles of Antietam or Gettysburg, in which Hood played a key role. Even so, it is still a very good book with some new views of Hood. One thing I found annoying was when McMurry dealt with the Atlanta Campaign he was very harsh and critical of J.E. Johnston (who he obviously dislikes) while basically claiming Hood could do no wrong during this campaign. Still, it is a interesting and good book, while being an easy read and giving some new views on Hood the man and Hood the general."
4,Solid Bullmastiff Info,"We are new to the breed and bought this book earlier this year to learn more about our new family member. Although, my first take on the book is that it was too focused on the professional breeder and showing the dog, I find I continue to go back to this book for basic information. Seems that I glean a little more info with each re-read. I still have unanswered basic questions but overall the book gave me much valuable information. We love the breed and are now 8 months into rearing a beautiful brindle bullie girl."
4,This rice pasta is a good replacement for wheat - without adding weight to yourself,"Instructions on heating this rice pasta are not clear,using comnon sense and not overcooking work ideal.Pasta has good taste and mixes well with tomato sauces.Easier to cook than wheat pasta."
1,Kills my battery,"The gauge I recieved has an internal short that causes a 3-4mA drain on my car's battery. The drain dissapears when the gauge is unplugged from it's wiring harness. Spoke to a representative at glowshift and they cannot honor the warranty on the gauge as it was not purchased directly from them. I'll be going with a higher quality autometer or sunpro gauge to replace this one, but beware, if you have a warranty issue and the gauge is not purchased from them directly, they won't replace it."
2,Nope..,Not that good of an anthology movie. Just kinda boring and the tales/stories that they have going on are just not all the interesting or fun to watch. I would say skip this one unless you just wanna drink some beers and chillout.
2,Promises More Than it Delivers,Why can’t every collection of horror shorts be like Romero’s original Creepshow? The first short is excellent however it’s all down hill from there.
1,Too Bizarre For Me!,"Unfortunately, I found the stories too disturbing for me. Very bloody, sadistic, degrading, and violent. Then again, many like these kinds of movies and will probably do fine with it. Could not watch some of the parts in most of the short stories. I quess I was expecting something else. Should have rented first. Will be destroying this one for the trash."
5,The Theatre Bizarre,"This Sleeper film was truly a strange collection of bizarre shorts. I wasnt expecting much but it was pretty entertaining. Each short seemed to get darker, stranger and more entertaining as it went along. I liked the off the wall theater the youg viewer was in that introduced each short film. The clown that popped out of the box was really freaky looking in a dark weird sort of way. Also, each film was unique and stood on its own not relaying on the other shorts. I think this film was just a cut above some of the other so-so dvds out right now. Will worth the cheap price I paid for it."
2,A dream to forget,"There really isn't a lot of good things to say about this album. Most of the tracks are more like ""filler"" tracks, which gives you an empty feeling. Plus at a cost of close to $30, It would make more sense to purchase a compilation from Dream Dance or Sunshine live."
2,"Nice balls, crate is utter trash.","These balls are beautiful, but the crate is useless. i would never trust the crate to hold the balls, because if the wood doesn't break apart the locks will, then I'll have 8 HEAVY balls falling on my foot. Really, the container is scary. Halex should recall it!"
5,"Heaviest, Biggest Balls Around","Colors are a little weird and bright, which make them look cheap, but when I compare these to any other set, they are bigger and heavier (and were fine after I threw them off some concrete)."
2,"No, This actually is ""Gripping Hand"" under a disquise.","Do not spend your money on this. No. This, actually, is the British edition of ""Gripping Hand"" under a disquise or nom de plume or some such alternate name. I gave ""G.H."" a two and will give this the same two. As a sequel to ""Mote"" it is disappointing. If you must have it, buy ""Gripping Hand""."
3,ripoff,It would be nice if you would state the other name for this book which is the Gripping Hand. Maybe then people wouldn't buy this book twice!
5,DVD+RW Dymystified,"The previous information presented in the ratings is not accurate.A DVD+RW Disc is made to be used with DVD+RW recorders only. The statements concerning usage in the Pioneer Drive DVD-R/RW are incorrect.The DVD+RW disc is not to be used in a DVD-R/RW recorder. It will not operate and it is not supposed to operate in this type of drive. The DVD+RW disc is made to operate in Philips, Ricoh, HP and Sony Drives that are DVD+RW compatible."
3,Works just fine,"This product works just fine. To use this DVD-RW as a data disk, you'll have to format it first. I used Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 Direct CD Format Utility. After formatting, the disk holds between 5.4 and 5.5 GB. I'm not sure DVD-RWs will render other removable media obsolete, as write-times are not what you get on hard drives or Iomega disks, but when you consider portability and physical storage space, this solution is pretty hard to beat."
3,Some songs ruin this DVD........,"I like about 3/4 of this DVD. BUT, they included some of the poorest songs from the albums Technical Ecstacy (the song with Bill Ward, the drummer, singing is HORRIBLE) and some of the weaker songs from their last album with OZZY Never Say Die. THEY COULD HAVE INCLUDED THE GOOD SONGS FROM THOSE TWO ALBUMS, but instead, they gave us [poo]. ALSO, the DVD is not anywhere near as long of playing time as claimed on the back cover."
4,THE GOLDEN YEARS,"The DVD is a Great item, and works well in this format. Plays best in a THX system. It's a Great Overview for any new or old fan of the original group. The time of the disc ( 85 Minutes) refers to the full disc content. This is a great disc if you don't like the Non-Ozzy Sabbath lineup. Disc one is potentially for one set of fans, and the second DVD has a different appeal, but this explains why the discs are separate, and it is not a ""Grab the Cash"" concept ( as in the way Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley do their Shtick)."
2,"20 years ago, on VHS, this was probably exciting","But today, most of this material exists in *far* better quality on youtube. For example, the Cal Jam footage is now color whereas on this DVD it is only B&W. And the Paris 1970 footage is not the original master here. Finally, the interviews are not very enlightening. If you want more interesting interview material (as opposed to a full concert) get the Last Supper DVD."
2,did MTV make this?,"i was looking for the definitive Black Sabbath dvd, something along the lines of what Led Zeppelin or KISS did with their dvd packages-- this ain't it. it looks as if VH1 produced this! i know they didn't, but, it looks like one of their 'Behind The Music'-jobs. 'Sabbath could've/should've put more stuff on there. i know there's a Vol. 2, but Vol. 1 wasn't all that-- plus, it covered the time frame i was interested in, The Ozzy Years. maybe, someday they'll get it together."
2,Love Sabbath but...,"I love the footage they showed, however the makers of the dvd cheated the public. The back of the disc say the aprox running time 85 minutes. It's actually 60 minutes. Somone said Vol. 2 of the DVD is 45 minutes. Don't you think they could have released both volumes in one disc? I think so. Talk about milking the fans for cash."
3,Fills in some blanks in the interesting history of this band,"This is a must for any Sabbath fan. Especially interesting were some of the less famous cuts performed live- like a vocal number by Ward. The downfall is only Butler and Iommi are interviewed here -cool stories though. Input from Ozzy and Ward should be crucial. Also the Video clips are poor. It would be better if a more thorough job was done documenting the band. (past interviews, recording footage etc.)"

2,Can I get an editor?,"Yes, the pictures in this book were breath taking, and yes, the piece was extremely well photographed. But as an editor myself, I was appalled at the poor quality of the text. It is obvious that Mutual Pub Co put very little, if any, funds and effort into editing this book. Did they think we weren't going to read the text? That we were just going to look at the pictures? When I buy a book about plants that claims that it will tell me about plants, I expect the book to be decently edited. I do not expect glaring grammatical errors (eg, confusing ""than"" and ""then"") and I do not expect a sales pitch in the middle of the book for canned pineapples. I returned this book to Amazon after I bought it. I'm going to go out and find a book that is actually readable AND has great pictures."
1,Time to Move On,"My language-learning background is one where I've learned French and Japanese by way of schools, textbooks, online, and CDs. By far, this book is the poorest method of teaching a language that allows an English speaker to dive wholeheartedly into the culture. First published in the 80's (in the US), the teaching methods show their age; especially given the wealth of technology available today.An example: I've learned via Japanese language that it is important to address fundamentals first, such as enunciating and writing an unfamiliar alphabet. Alas, charts and tables in this book do not provide these options, and it appears the author assumes one has a basic understanding of the Greek language. In short, presupposition reigns. Interestingly, I can see how this text would also be pedantic for the intermediate user, making me wonder at what level one might benefit from this book.I wish I could recommend an alternative, but I'm in the throes of discovering that myself. Onward..."
1,Poor Quality Control,"The switch is very easy to hook up (that is one star). However, there is a lot of static noise. Since all the terminals have the same problem, it is probably due to a loosened power cord/switch, or poor insulation, causing interference, or maybe worse. Return immediately the next day."
2,"not a good purchase, no tech help","bought this for the game cube . i can get the vcr and game cube to work but the TV will not work. The instructions are not very clear and mentions a tv/game switch that is non exsitant. i am very dissapointed. There is no tech help availbe to find out what the proble is.I would like to have everything working but can't figure it out. Have spent countless hours re doing all the wiring and with only the success of getting game cube and vcr to work. NO TV , if my granddaughter wants to watch TV we have to unhook everything or go to another tv"
2,"Many Problems, but decent support","I purchased this, but it was defective. The coax output (built-in RF modulator) always had major white noise, rendering the unit utterly useless. I called their support line with the problem, and they answered immediately and gave me a reference number and address to return it to, but I decided it was not worth the effort or cost of shipping to return the unit. From the looks of other reviews on here, it seems that my experience is not uncommon."
1,Cute only...,"We bought the whole Pink Toile set, so I gave it 1 star for it being a cute (but very expensive) addition to the set. However, it only spins and makes music when you wind it up, which lasts for maybe 45 SECONDS!!! Just buy for decoration and get something else if you're looking for more stimulation for the baby."
5,An excellent dictionary that is easy on the eye.,"I am no lexicographer, but this is definitely one of the better dictionaries in terms of ease of use, layout, and print quality. It is smaller (and thus more convenient to handle) than the American Heritage or Merriam-Webster college editions but still packs almost 1,700 pages. The entries include many examples and concise, straightforward etymological notes. I particularly like this dictionary because of its clean layout, the quality of its paper, and its typeface: they make the dictionary much more readable than most dictionaries. Of course, it serves mainly British English, but American spelling is included. Definitely recommended by this reader."
3,Not so fast,"This is by no means a worthy successor to the old Chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary. Printed on thick paper, it has nowhere near the number of entries, has none of the interesting and charming Contents such as Correct Ceremonious Forms of Address and Supplement, and is cumbersome to the hand. Serious crossword addicts and etymologists should try Chambers English Dictionary, 1993. Out of print at the moment but worth waiting for."
1,Not as Good As Last Century's Chamber's Dictionary,I was expecting an update to Chamber's Dictionary (formerly Chambers 20th Century Dictionary) and was very disappointed. It seems that many words have disappeared from the English language as we move into the 21st Century. While easier on the eyes it does not cover as many words as the earlier edition. Don't buy this if you are looking for a good crossword puzzle dictionary.
5,Alphagrip AG-5 USB keyboard and mouse combo,"Ergonomic USB Computer Keyboard & Trackball AlternativeI've had my first alphagrip for well over a year and have a second one for home now. I love it and use it literally everyday. Most of the day at work I'm stuck behind a computer and this keyboard has improved my productivity tremendously. Typing speed is faster and mouse to keyboard transitions don't exist anymore.My favorite part is the extra desk space I have now, and the ability to sit back and relax while working and typing. Also, if you have an xbox360, then it will work as a USB keyboard for it as well.It took me about a week of use to get the buttons memorized and another week to improve my speed with it. This is a great product and a reasonable price for a combination keyboard and mouse."
2,"Interesting idea, but hurt my hands even more","I have large hands and RTS, and thought I'd give this a whirl. Aftera couple weeks I sent it back. The mouse was too hard to use, and I couldn't see spending the time for it to feel ""natural"" when it only made my hands hurt more. Not to mention having to hold up the controller all the time."
2,Very odd but innovative,"This ""keyboard"" is very innovative, but you need to hope you have the right size hands to use it. It's not adjustable and I found my wrists to be in an awkward position.It's an innovative idea, but needs some refinement. In my opinion, it's and idea who's time just hasn't arrived yet."
3,"Ok, but not good enough","I had hoped to replace my keyboard and mouse with this product and it doesn't quite come up to the level required to do that. I spent the time to learn the keys, but a few things bothered me too much:1. I use the arrow keys a lot and they are hard to use with this product.2. I use the mouse scroll wheel frequently, and again, it isn't made easy with this product.3. Even with the modifications for my larger-than-average hands, it still hurt my fingers.If you are primarily using the computer for data entry or typing, this is a solid replacement for your keyboard and mouse. It will make you more comfortable and possibly even more productive. As a general-use input device for people that may type, surf the web, play a few flash-games, etc, it will end up being a hindrance."
2,"Interesting idea, clumsy implementation","I bought this device as part of my search for the perfect input device.I give it a try for a month and try to use it as much as possible and get proficient with it.My conclusion is that this device is a good idea, but end result is clumsy and of low quality (of course but that time the return period lapse, so I had to take the hit and donate it to GoodWill).It has too many buttons on the front which are difficult to operate because the character keys are actually on the other side, so you can't get a good grip without hitting the character keys.And regarding the character keys on the back, the feel is flimsy and erratic.I found a much better device for my Apple Mac Mini media center; that is the Logitech diNovo Mini.Not as alternative looking, but well constructed, reliable, and bluetooth capable!Logitech diNovo Mini"
4,Liked!,This book had me feeling a plethora of emotions but I'm glad a read it! I had to rush through a few parts because I couldn't handle some of the emotions but I'm glad I read it!
3,What a downer,"This is a nice quick read, but it is the most depressing book I have ever read. It is well written, but if you are looking for a pick me up this is not the book for you. It starts out good, gets really sad and it never really gets happier. I just felt that I was in a day to day grief-fest with the character."
4,Excellent!,"This is the copy of their old VHS and is well worth the purchase for any Queensryche fan! I think they could have done some editing of the band chatter behind the scenes (not into it when the interview or people are doing voice over while the music is playing), but the copy form tape to the DVD is a great addition to the collection!!"
2,"What an awesome DVD this could have been, if Geffen hadn't ruined it.","Finally we get the entire music video collection from Queensryche. Unfortunately, somebody who should be shot, decided it would be cool to have the band talk over the start of nearly all the music videos, essentially ruining them. Geffen & whoever was in charge of this project screwed up in a major way! This could have been one of the best DVDs out there..."
5,Awesome!,"Queensryche in my opinion, is one of the best bands in the progressive metal era. I really wish that it would've included more from the MTV ""Unplugged"" special though. The way they played ""I Will Remember"" was so spine chilling that it gave me goosebumps. I looked all over for this video and I found it. It's very hard to find now since it is out-of-print, so that makes it even more special to me. If you like queensryche this video is a must."
3,Very gruesome but inspiring,"I would recommend this book for those over the age of ten. The first two or three chapters go into great detail as to how a cannibal catches his prey and then kills him and eats him. While the story itself is a great one, and very inspiring, the writing could be better. It gets a bit monotonous at times."
2,Major Disappointment,"With all due respect to Don Richardson and his editor, the book is far too wordy. I would recommend any of the following books instead: ""Bruchko"", ""Torn Veil"", ""I Dared to Call Him Father"", ""Heavenly Man"", or ""A Thousand May Fall.""I was disappointed that Peace Child was so ponderous because I know this must be an incredible story, yet I could not wade through the verbiage. And, the gory descriptions of cannabalism were gratuitous, at best."
2,ouch!,"Peace Child did not leave me feeling peaceful or inspired. I enjoy missionary books, I have a deep respect for those who use their lives to save others.Yet this story seems not only violent, but contrived, and saturated with vivid descriptions of evil. The descriptions of God's saving Grace amongst these people are unaccountably mild and weak.I wanted to like it, but after some thought and prayer,I ended up throwing this book in my garbage, because I have my doubts about who is served. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
3,Torn :(,The book was recieved quickly but it was torn up in the mail. The cover was torn and all the pages were bent. The package was ripped open on both ends and caused the book to become damaged and ripped.
2,Interesting but not exciting,This is the true story of a missionary who lives among cannibals to bring the word of God to them. It's a quick read as there isn't a lot of substance to it. No surprise ending. Obviously if the missionary wrote the book he didn't get eaten!
5,Don't miss this book.,"How can it be anything but a series of miracles that a missionary couple and their children would even want to venture into tribes of cannibals and headhunters where no white man had been seen, survive and thrive and bring many to Yahusha the Savior? Nowadays some feel it is politically incorrect to take the Gospel into pagan areas and change their culture. The cannibals in this srory saw it differntly. Their lives of treachery,butchery, fear and horror were not exactly Edenesque. While others are making names for themselves in politics, Fortune 500 or wherever, I suspect this couple's names are famous in Heaven. It is not just reading of the lives that were transformed that was so transfixing, but how much we see the grace of the Father in leading to that transformation, and how the book helps us to see what our basic human nature is without the Scriptures and their impact on our culture."
4,An unbelievable story,"A wonderful testimony of God's faithfulness to all of His people. It proves that in our heart there is no cultural barrier, nor is there a cultural barrier in God's eye. The reason I didn't give it a 5 is that it wasn't 5 star writing, even though it was a fascinating story I thought it dragged at times and a little hard to follow.On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine the courage of Don and Carol Richardson. I would never have lasted a day!This is definately a must read. I'm not sure I would recommend it to a younger audience only because it is a bit graphic and sickening."
5,Shakey start with a strong finish,It is depressing to read about the horrible cultural elements of the Sawi people. I'm thankful that Don Richardson and the many other incredible people had the guts to answer the call to go to these people. Don's wife is above remarkable. She was such a key to Don being able to say yes to the Holy Spirit's call. Our world is so full of people who are full of themselves. The Richardson's emptied themselves in order to reach these people. I am challenged by their story.
5,Bruchko,"A quick, easy, descriptive good read! I wanted to know more but realized the author gave enough info to totally describe his experiences."
5,Peace Child,"A true story of how the Gospel of Jesus Christ can cross cultures and change the lives of violent people. A great message for the world today, especially for people who believe that the answer to violence is more violence. Also, an interesting cultural study of indigenous people."
5,Our God is an awesome God!,This book is awesome. My family first read it when I was about ten. I read it when I was fifteen for school and did a report on it. It is a life changing book which realistically shows what true missions is. It also shows God's amazing grace in a hopeless situation. The way God used the Richardsons is amazing. Praise God!
3,Long time to deliver,I have been waiting before Christmas for this book and there is no word as to why it is delayed.
3,Peace Child,"The book was in excellent condition. Would certainly purchase from this vendor again.This book is quite descriptive and very detailed, especially in the first part. Getting past that, the remainder of the story is definitely inspired, and reflects God's wonderful preparation when He calls you to act to His Glory."
1,Not worth the price,"I purchased this last year. A few months later several squares were unplayable. The company never responded to my emails and I should have returned it through Amazon. It is very bright, but I was easily able to defeat it at the highest level setting for playing a simple game. DO NOT pay $100.00 for this product."
5,super,"This handheld is sturdy and cool.The LCD is one of the larger ones I have seen on a handheld computer.Unlike some LCD Handhelds, this one actually has a white square in the bottom right corner."
1,Don't Buy This Chess Game,"I love chess and I play at least one game of portable game versus me daily. When I am on frequent business trips, my chess games keep me sane on delayed airplanes. I have several Excaliber portable chess games, and although they work, the screen is hard to see in most light and the white pieces tend to be the hardest to see.The pieces in this game are even harder to see and distinguish one from another. The black and the white look similar, and all the rest of the pieces are so similar that it is hard to distinguish a bishop from a knight.The game is also very heavy, and since I am a small woman carrying a heavy bag, that is also a big disappointment. Not worth the price -- it seems like an old design because of the lousy graphics and weight."
1,graphics are very poor,Product Dimensions:as shown on amazon site 8 x 6.8 x 2.5 inches are incorrectactual size 3x5x3/4 inches....resolution of display is very poormuch better would be the cheapest pda running chess master which i use now
1,broke very easily. can't be repaired,My daughter is an excellent chess player so I got this for practicing on the subway and times like that. She only got about a month of use out of it before it stopped working out of nowhere. I can't believe I spent $80 for this thing and it is already completely useless. I guess you live and learn. Online chess or computer software will have to do but what I really wanted was something handheld because we spend a ton of time on the subway.
3,Very Small,These are nicely made but much smaller than I thought they would be. They almost disappear in your ear. Luckily the necklace I bought them to wear with is also smallish.
3,A Fun Ride,"A fun little read, this one follows the trials of a guy my age, living in my city, having much more crazy and interesting adventures than I do. Naturally, there was a lot there I could relate to (especially the ""This is a Heavy Product"" sticker mystery - on of my favourite quirks of Melbourne).On the downside, I found the ending a little unsatisfying, and although there was some sense of closure, there were still plenty of questions unanswered towards the end. I don't know whether it really sets itself up for a part two, however it could make for a decent movie adaption one day.All up, a humourous look at life in inner-city Melbourne, but I'm not sure how well it might work for those unfamiliar with the territory, as a lot of ""Australian-centric"" things can be."
1,Buy with caution!,"Some of the other reviews refer to DVD/R, DVD/RW or DVD+RW, which are all different, incompatible formats from DVD-RAM. I can only speak to my Memorex DVD-RAM experience. I own over 40 DVD-RAM cartridges, mostly from Maxell, TDK & Panasonic. Only 2 have ever failed: this Memorex & a freebie from Optodisk. I thought I would try this Memorex because if it's [low] price. It failed within the first week of use, taking all 9.4 Gigs of data with it, and the defect was such that it could not even be reformatted. Getting a replacement under the warranty was so much trouble that it wasn't worth it. I've heard tell that that these Memorex DVD-RAMs don't play nicely with Macs. Buyer beware!"
5,Very fun and educational,"Lambchop's playalong was my favorite tv show growing up and this dvd does not disappoint. From all the songs to the hilarious antics of Lambchop and her brothers, this dvd collection is a must-have for fans of this barely-known series. These dvds are also educational for non-Jews who are curious to some of the customs surrounding Chanukah and Passover."
5,Awesome movies,Every Jewish family needs this. My kids watch this every year and love it. Great for little kids. It explains the holidays while keeping the stories fun.
5,love this game,"My family hasn't had this game in ages, and we were always talking about it but couldn't find it anywhere. I was so excited when this seller offered it at a reasonable price. If you have looked around this site, some prices are around $90 !!!! - - - - for a board game!!!!This game is fun and you will learn quite a bit if you retain the information it contains. I say you should try this game if the price is right. Make sure you play with fellow gamers, because if you have to twist someone's arm to play games, they probably won't like this one. It can take a while."
2,"Good info, but horrible binding","My daughter consulted this so much that the pages fell out. They are scattered all around the house now, which doesn't much help her. Before the binding failed, she read it constantly, now we can't even find all the pages."
1,Worst book binding I've ever seen!,"It is simply not bound well enough to be used frequently. Ours started falling apart within a couple months, and has lost several pages. For a while it was being read nearly daily by my son, but that shouldn't cause a book to start losing pages."
1,Product O.K. just missing several pages,"This book arrived but it was missing several pages. It looked good on the outside but as soon as we looked inside, we could see that it was missing pages.Sad that people would sell the book for money."
5,pokedex guide,"The first of the pokemon game pokedex guides. This one is pretty good, lots of pokemon and their general locations in them up to a certain game in the series."
5,one of my all time favorites.,"this movie about a fish (nemo) he is lost, and his father is trying to find him. great movie for the kids"
2,finding nemo movie,don't use the 3d dvd. the shipping was fine.One dvd we can't get to work on our blue ray dvd player.My 2 year old loves the movie very much
2,Disappointed,"Received my 3D movie yesterday, played it last night and am disappointed in the 3D quality. The movie, of course, is great but am not impressed with the quality of it being in 3D."
3,Labelling/Sizing,"I purchased a pair for my wife who normally wears a size ""medium"". Either the medium gloves were incorrectly labelled...or the sizes run small and you should order a size larger than you normally would. We're requesting a return authorization and exchange for a size ""large"", same gloves and color."
3,Great Clip Restorations,"This presentation was especially notable for the wonderful quality of the restoratins. A lot of time and effort went into making very old, beat-up material look great.That said, not much new is added here. FDR's era has been well documented, and saying that this is about ""a Presidency Revealed"" is a little overreaching. We've seen or heard all this before.Well-presented and a good trip for newcomers to the Roosevelt tradition, especially given the oncoming election season..."
2,Drags on too long,"So this is basically a Scarlet Pimpernel story: man has a secret identity helping people escape unjust torture; woman marries man and has complete contempt for his foppish persona while secretly admiring his heroic, exciting alter-ego. And oh, yeah, that's also the basic premise behind Superman and Spiderman too.So the story isn't exactly original, and the first 100 or so pages of this book just beat the plot into your head until you just want something to happen already, for heaven's sake! I have a feeling the author could have cut out almost half of this book and had a pretty decent Harlequin Historical.Suggestion: The Scarlet Pimpernel is a much better, more exciting book."
1,beloved warrior,"haven't started this book yet; but after i bought it, read that it is #3 - but no where in the book tells me the names of books #1 and #2. i would like to get them and read them in order. can someone tell me the names of the other books and did they like them. i collect patricia potter books and would like to read them in order. thanks"
3,It was good..,"but not GREAT! For some reason Rory & Bethia did not ring emotionally true - like it was difficult to connect with their emotions and really believe in them. With most good books, I really identify and champion the characters and for some reason this book didn't breath life into the characters. It was a good story and suspenseful story, but in my opinion there are many books I've enjoyed much more."
2,Buy one of her reprints instead!,"What has happened to Patricia Potter? How did an honored writer of historical romance get trapped into penning this lukewarm rehash of The Scarlet Pimpernel? Man-masquerades-as-fop-even-from-his-wife-who-coincidentally-needs-his-rescue-services. Ho hum. If she had added any value or research to this I would have rejoiced. But no post-Gabaldon author can be allowed to think that she has written a Scottish romance just by using the words ""plaid"", ""kilt"" and ""no"" instead of ""not""? I have read every Potter every published. I wish I had stopped before this one."
5,I just LOVED it.,"This is the type of book that isn't easy to put down once you start reading it. It was so intertaining, so 'on the edge of your seat' and also romantic. Ms. Potter is no MADELINE HUNTER when it comes to love scenes, but they were sweet nonetheless, if evasive."
5,Great clock for car dash,"Just want I needed for my car dash, so my passenger could see the time . Easy to read with date and time"
3,Amazon purchase,Meets my expectations with the exception that I wanted a small digital clock with 24 hour (Military) capabilities. Other than the 24 hr aspect I'm very happy with the RoadPro rp-255 Elecrtronic Big Digit clock.
4,needed a clock for my truck,Works good easy to use and looks good too.Glad I bought it. Wish this program did't count words good ye
1,How unlike Amazon!,"One little piece of paper telling you what you have, what each button is for, like how the hell do you set it, would have saved me a trip to the kitchen to throw it in the trash can. Yeah! Very unlike most of Amazon's products!"
2,Not The Best Deal Ever,"I used this clock in my car, but when inside of the car gets hot, the clock resets the time and won't respond to button pushes until you remove the batteries. If you plan to use it inside in a cool or normal environment, it should be fine. The numbers are big and easy to see, it's just not suited for automobile use."
3,It's a clock,"When the clock on the car radio died, we had two choices. Buy a new radoi or a clock. We bought a clock. This one works as advertised, keeps good time and has a light. I stuck it on the dash, set the time and forgot about it."
4,Serve its purpose,"I found the product decently made. Large display and so far accurate. Given its cheap price, I wont ask for more. It fully serves its purpose as a car clock."
5,One idea alone has saved me thousands!,"I'm not kidding. THere are several ideas in here that will save you tons of time AND money! I share concepts in this book with members of our eBay discussion group almost every month! GREAT IDEAS. REad about saving on insurance, shipping, and more."
2,Not popular at all,"My cats did not like this at all. They like things that shake and make noises, but they also like things they can sink their teeth into and carry around proudly. This toy was a bust because they could not pick it up and carry it around."
5,Shake rattle and roll!!!,This is smaller than I thought but no problem because my kitten LOVES this toy!!Would recommend this toy :)
3,An OK read,"Book was ok, it was purchased because other books in the series were given as a gift. Completly predictable and unrealistic as with all romance books."
5,Great book,I bought this book as a gift for a 3 year old who is part Caribbean. Everyone in the family loves the book. Very happy with the purchase.
2,I don't like it,I don't like the book becuase the mom diyd in the begining of the story.The story is about a litol girl in the begining of the story and after the begining it's about a litol gril named Cendrillon and a prins and a faerygodmother in the mittol of the story and she wont's the prins look at her like a rich person at ferst then she wont's the prins look at her like her sellf
1,cendrillon,This story is about a poor girl that lives with her two sisters and her evil step mother. And at the middle of the story she goes to a ball and when her god mother pulld her out she lost a slipper on her way out. The man she saw was a prince and the prince she saw looked all around town and he nocked on there door and first he checked the evil step mother and then the two sisters and it did not fitht. Than he saw cendrillon and she chride it on and it was a perfict match. Than they got married and lived happley ever after.I do not like this story becouse i am a boy and some boys do not like storys like this becouse it is like a prince and queen.
4,This book is fairytale magic!,"If you liked cinderella you will love cendrillon. It's Cinderella back in action, but on the island of Martinique. Read this revue.Like all princess stories there's fairytale love. This book is about an evil step mother and a evil step sister taking over a little girls life by making her a maid. The little girl has a godmother. Her godmother has a special wand her mom gave her.The little girl's step mom won't let Cendrillon go to the ball. Will she go to the ball? Will her godmother use the wand on her? But theres one thing i forgot to tell you something the godmother can only use the wand on someone she loves. So can she use the wand? That is the question?I thought this book was great!!!! I thought it was so cool how they put of the laugene of Martnque in the book.The pitures were great too.From:Weasel"
5,Written by Nakeisha,"My class wrote book reviews and this one was too good to not post.CenderillionI liked this book because it is a very good book to read. I liked the part when Cendrillon's godmother waved her wand and Cendrillon turned into a girl with a beautiful dress.What I didn't like about this book was when Cendrillon's mother died. It was a little bit upsetting so I don't really think that I want infant children to read this book.The author was called Robert D San Souci and did a great job of the writing. The paragraphs were very good and had lots of verbs, adjectives and adverbs.The illustrator was called Brian Pinkey and he must have traced the pictures unless he is that amazing of a drawer and is very smart!We loved this book in Year 3!"
3,"I liked it , it was ok exciting","Cendrillon, by Robert D San Suoci is about a washer woman who has an evil step mother and step sister. Sound familiar?I enjoyed the book because it's like Cinderella and it is funny. It is funny because she turns lizards into horses.The author is trying to tell us how Cendrillon is like Cinderella."
4,We liked this story because some words were in French.,"We rated it number four because we liked the drawings. We thought the drawings brought out the book. We thought the illustrations were very colorfuland very interesting because it was by the Carrabien Sea. We, also, liked it because some words were in French. There should not have been servants in the story. We thought it was like the other Cinderella stories. The author should have changed it a little bit. We suggest younger school aged pupils would enjoy this book better that upper elementary pupils. We have enjoyed reading this book a lot. By : The Four Recess Lovers*"
3,Cendrillon was o.k.,This story is about a poor girl named Cendrillon. She works for her eivil step mom and step sister.When cendrillon godmother was little her mother died and gave her a wand and that was the only thing she gave her because it was so speacial to her.I think this story is o.k. . Itis good if you would like fariy tales it was exactly like cenderalla .
2,Cendrillon,"Once their was a girl who was poor. Her name was Cendrillon, she was a washerwoman. A fairy came and turned her into a buitful woman.The only reason she went to the ball is cause of her fairy. She makes her verey happy. Her fairy grabbs her out of the ball she is verey mad. She droped her slipper in the ball. The prince goes around to all the houses and tryed to see whos slipper it was it was Cendrillon's. they get maired and live happley ever after."
2,It's not the greatest.,"Cendrion is another version of Cinderella. It is o.k but it doesn't grab me like other books do.Nannin's mother dies and gives her something special. Nannin ends up as a washerwoman. The lady who she is working for has a baby and then dies. The step mother is working Cendrillon so hard that her hands get bright red and blistery. Later Cendrillon's godmother helps her sneak in until 12 o'clock.The story is o.k, but I have read better books.It's funny because I LOVE Cinderella but not so much of Cendrillon.By:Felicity M."
2,Cendrillon was O.K.,Cendrillon I think is a O.K. story because it is a lot like Cinderella it's just anouther version Cinderella.Nannins mother dies and gives her something magical. Then Cendrillon comes along and her mother dies to. Her father marys Madam. The prince Paul has a ball and Cendrillon has to sneek in to the ball.I feel the book was a O.K. But if you like Cinderella you will really like Cendrillon. Cinderella and Cendrillon are alike but then they are not the same.By:Space Dog
3,"Great photos, context lacking","Color photographs of rare uniform items, associated insignia, and field equipment used in the Wehrmacht's tropical campaigns are outstanding. Moreover, the selection of period black-and-white photographs is exceptional - nearly all of them are unpublished and all should be of interest to both the historian and militaria collector. Unfortunately, a number of their accompanying captions contain errors or omissions, and often fail to provide context of a respective unit's operations in the North African or Mediterranean campaigns. I realize that this work is not intended to be an operational history or order-of-battle tabulation, but found that the lack of more background perspective was dissatisfying. I haven't yet seen the companion volume, which covers documents and paper items - perhaps it provides the historical framework that is lacking in Volume 1."
4,Title of Book is Misleading,"The author did a disservice to himself by incorrectly stating in the title of the book that it was a history of the cold war. The book is not, unlike the title might suggest, a history of the cold war. The book does not cover anything much outside of Europe and really does not touch on the political issues of the time.What the book does give you is a very detailed and interesting review of the U.S., NATO and Warsaw Pact equipment, base structure and high level battle strategies for a war in Europe. The author has done a good amount of research on these topics and presents a very readable rundown of this information. If you are interested in these topics, especially the details on the equipment used then this book can almost act as a reference book. Overall it is a good book, good level of detail and written in a readable fashion."
3,Awesome IF COMBINED WITH the FerreTrail Flex-E Fun-nels!,"I initially bought this item by itself for my energetic pet ferret thinking he would roll around in it and have a great time. BUT he just didn't understand what the point of it was. I'd put him in it, next to it, and even roll it around in front of him and he would just stare at it blankly. This being the case, I decided to buy some of the Flex-E Fun-nels that are compatible with it to try and peak his interest. Now he loves sliding through the tunnels that attach to this ball and rolling about it it. Both items however, were rather pricy and I've found toys that my ferret enjoyed more that cost MUCH less."
1,Not what is shown in picture!,This item was misrepresented. As shown in the picture there is a clear lid on this ball. When I received mine today it has several holes and no lids to cover any of them. This is advertised as a ferret roll around ball and instead it is actually a ball that conects to tubes for the ferret to crawl through. If possible I would like the covers to the openings sent to me. I am not returning the product because its not worth the shipping or the trip to the post office. I am very dissapointed that there is no way to contact Amazon about problems with orders. If the seller is an individual you can contact them but if the seller is Amazon there is no way to contact them. This is the second problem I have had with an item purchased from Amazon.
1,DANGEROUS TOY - DO NOT BUY FOR GUINEA PIGS!!!,"Never ever put a guinea pig in one of these -this seller is misrepresenting the product by claiming it is for guinea pigs, and it can result in severe injury to the spine of your animal and other types of injury as well. An exercise ball is actually a very poor toy when there are other options that allow your pet to get proper exercise. Your vet will agree! Don't trust the pet stores that sell these -if your pet dies they'll just sell you another pet. Listen to the folks that love animals rather than this seller who is deceptive -advertising a product for a use it is not intended for by the manufacturer and advocating a use that could cause severe physical harm. There are many other reviews on Amazon about the dangers of this kind of toy. This seller makes me ill."
2,Trashy,"I watched a few episodes of this show on the recommendation of a friend and I'm not sure what appeal this show holds. It's full of paparazzi jerks running around making life miserable for everybody around them. The characters are all really disagreeable - except perhaps the psychitzo photographer. Also, at least one scene per show borders on hardcore porn. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it does have some innovative cinematography. Still, the show overall feels like reading a tabloid mag in the supermarket aisle."
1,Bad Movie,"Illogical film. The script does not work. When Slater finally realizes what is happening, he would have gone directly to the FBI with his girlfriend. After all, we are told in the beginning of the film that the FBI are paying close attention to these oil mergers. But he acts stupid? His life and his girlfriend's life are on the line and he keeps playing the game? He doesn't seek protection and call in the professionals? This stupid course of action is never explained.One star because I like Slater's acting talents -- even in a bad movie."
4,Good movie but slow,"The deal got a bad review because it points out corruption in are system.While the movie is slow it does tell a great story.I believe the deal shows the real side of a corrupt society. This movie is fiction but it shows what people will do for the power and money.""It is a revoultionary act to tell the truth in a nation,society, and world full of deciet and lies."""
3,Lacking tension,"A distinct lack of dramatic tension afflicts this summer release thriller, but Christian Slater really isn't too bad as the corporate lawyer at the center of a corrupt oil deal at a time in the future when U.S. gas is at $6 a gallon. This came out in '05 before the $4 gallon gas of '08 almost made the movie unexpectedly prescient. Robert Loggia is also pretty good as the corporate tycoon who brokers the deal. A few people get shot. Hey, this is Hollywood. The romances have some heat, too. I'm surprised this one is so under the radar. It's worth a watch on a slow weeknight."
5,An H.P. Lovecraft story written by Faulkner,"This is a book that takes the familiar Lovecraftian, or maybe Derlethian, scenario--a young man inherits a house, is taken over by the spirit of the place and is destroyed by obsession--and explores it with deep psychological realism. The effect is uncanny: It's almost as if the cardboard characters of the Lovecraft stories (which, don't get me wrong, I love) have come to life. In order to sustain the realistic tone, the supernatural elements all happen offstage--but if you've ever wondered what it would really be like to be enslaved by a priestess of the Elder Gods, this book is for you. This edition is out of print, but the novel is reprinted in full in The Fred Chappell Reader, which is in print. I have to wonder what fans of Chappell, who is mostly a writer of Southern Literature, make of a novel whose first words are ""Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."""
2,Creepy & somewhat evocative but deeply gross.,"Subhuman yokels abuse, tattoo & murder one another while worshipping demons."
2,Read this for your own edification.,"1) incredibly small - inside dimensions about 34"" x 34"" and the small slats make it look like a high security prison.2) difficult to move from room to room. bulky and surprisingly heavy for its diminutive size, even disassembled.3) ugly, bulky plastic. not attractive unless you live in a plastic house. the inexpensive metal cages look better.4) ignore the review that says 'just hose it down for cleaning' - screws and moving metal parts will rust and water will be retained in the hollow housing."
2,Not Escape Proof!,"Loved this product when I received it, but it's been just two weeks and my 2 lb 2 month old chihuahua puppy has learned to scale these walls with ease!"
2,escapable!,"While it looks nice, it has two large flaws, my 19 pound boston terrier was able to easily jump out and then when he was lazy, he somehow managed to figure out how the door latch works and simply opened the door. So in a nutshell, it simply is not secure enough for small dogs."
2,I wanted to love this book... but,I really loved the potential of the story line. But the execution was very poor. Unfortunately. It could have been a significantly stronger story with just a few adjustments.I WANTED to love this book... and unfortunately I couldn't. The characters and the story line were solid... but the writing itself... and the romance between the two was uneven. I really couldn't see the much except passion and respect between the two... I didn't see love ... and the kids were WONDERFUL... but they did hog the limelight... and take away from the romance.
3,"Okay, but not her best.","As with most of the other people giving their opinion on this book, I must say I agree. While I do read a lot of romantic novels, I also read a lot of just about everything else.I would love to see Ms Monk return to the style of her Scottish romance; Once a Warrior, The Witch and the Warrior and The Rose and the Warrior. Now those were books to go to bed with and enjoy."
1,Why so expensive?,I want to try her books but they are so expensive!! Why? A lot of them are older too. I don't get it? The kindle version is more money than the actual book! $10 is way to ridiculous.
2,The queen of romantic let-down......,"This book was not about Genevieve and Haydon, it was about the children. Karyn Monk has such potential but I don't think she knows what type of book she wants to write. Her writing is far more intelligent than some other writers, but she needs to entwine that intelligence with a romantic plot. She strays from what the romance reader wants to read. I wouldn't recommend this one for fans of the romance genre."
2,Disappointing,"I have read all of Karyn Monk's books and have loved them, especially her earlier ones. This one, however, I could not get into and what little I did read I didn't like. This one I would recommend you pass on buying and get it from a book exchange in stead. Save your money for some of the better books that are out there."
1,Nothing More Than Common Sense,"This book is obviously outdated. I knew that going in, but thought there would be some timeless gems. I bought this because it was based on interviews with successful job seekers. There is not one single quote from a successful employee. It is all generalized common sense. For example, win over gate keepers, Define problems, etc."
3,"Good Content, could have been written better","The authors show good command over the subject. There are several key aspects mentioned in the book which are not obvious to everyone. The authors stumble on getting the right message out. In short, it's a very long book to cover a small subject."
4,Great video if you're a real Chili Peppers fan,"I hear a lot of people say about this video, ""This video only has their old videos, it would be better if they put some newer ones on it."" Well, that's the point. If you are a fan of the pre-90's chili peppers or just want to learn a little about their history, this is a great dvd. It contains all of their pre-Blood Sugar Sex Magik music videos, plus some bonus concert footage. If you want newer videos, buy their newer DVD. I personally liked ""What Hits!?"" a lot, as I am a huge RHCP fan. Definitely worth checking out."
4,very engaging and informative,Gives you the background to appreciate the Bellows exhibit and catalogue. Great old film footage of the New York of Bellows' early years.
5,KEEPING THE MAGIC ALIVE,"This is one of the most interesting seasons. With Samantha having a second baby to Dick Sargent and Alice Ghostley making their debuts. Agnes Moorhead, Erin Murphy, and Maurice Evans return as part of the whole Bewitching family. And who could ever forget Sandra Gould as the hysterical Gladys Kravitz and George Tobias as her oblivious husband. I hope Season Seven holds some more interesting surprises!!!"
2,Disappointed,I only ordered this video because I thought there may have been a few episodes with Dick York on it. Dick Sargent is so wooden.
2,real darrin gone,"i collected all eight episodes to have the entire collection, and although i am a huge fan, the season starts to stink with the new darrin and running out of plots. the new darin has no facial expressions and the chemistry between the two of them is not good."
5,My favorite tv show,"I collect Bewitched, it is a great tv showw, I will pass it long for all my future generations."
4,Four Stars,"Another great season of Bewitched. As everyone knows this is the season Darren has been replaced which sparked endless debates on which Darren was best the first or the second. For me neither of them made much of a difference. The best scenes for me were always centered around Endora, Samantha, and Tabitha. The three actresses were so good and funny together that he almost wasn't even needed. Endora's endless spells on Darren started getting old and boring. Another new charactor was Esmeralda a bumbling witch now that Clara was gone (the actress who played her passed away). This didn't work for me. I adored Clara who was bumbling but lovable at the same time while Esmeralda was just didn't have the same magic as Clara."
1,Bewitched Season 6,The discs were damaged and did not play properly. I Could not contact the sender to refund. I ended up throwing them away.
4,Bewitched 6th Season,"I have not had a chance to view this yet it seems to be new as ordered, Thank you so much"
5,Great TV,"The sixth season was at first hard to watch with the ""new"" Darrin (Dick Sargeant). But once you get used to him, it's alright. And It's nice to see Tabitha grow up into a cute little girl. All the others still crack me up - Serena, Uncle Arthur, Endora, and Larry Tate."
4,I am satisfied with the delivery system. It was so fast.,"Overall, the contents of book are well organized, and easy to understand.I do not hesitate to recommend this book as a text book for class."
1,Math book,"Sorry to say, book was in very poor condition......do not think it was worth the money I was charged."
4,A very informative book. Interesting and informative.,"Overall a very good book. Not only covers lighthouses but lightships and fog signals as well. Most of the major lighthouses were very well covered, however some of the lesser known ones were not as well covered. The book is a little sparse with pictures, but what pictures it does have are very good. A comprehensive chart listing the charactaristics of the lights covered would be nice. I would not hesitate to purchase this book."
3,Average,"I was a little disappointed because the title of the book said, Illustrated copy and there were hardly any pictures. I sent this book to a man who speaks very little English and I wanted a book where he could view the different lighthouses of America."
5,Wow!,"This book is great! It all starts when the dark magic lures innocent mouse Arthur into the sewers. In the sewers you will find rats with mousepeelers instead of hands, rats wearing mouse coats as a trophy of slaughtering an innocent mouse, and a dark rat god. It will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense."
3,cramps,"Brass part is very good, but the hose clamp is a piece of crap. I had to go all the way to town for a decent one."
3,Could've been better,"This book starts stronger than it finishes. Like others have mentioned, it definitely grabs you from the beginning, but along the way you start to wonder if the author has really worked it all out, or if he's just making things up as he goes.For instance, what was the deal with the whole South Pole sequence? That primeval forest discovered below the ice? It had absolutely nothing to do with the story. Neither did the flashbacks to the Giza pyramids, which were narrative dead-ends.This story needed a cleaner, tighter narrative that didn't skip around quite so much. By the end, it felt too scattershot and just a tad contrived the way everything comes together.Still, it was fun, and the parts I liked I really liked. I'll definitely check out Tigerman's next novel, he has promise."
3,not up to its potential,"I liked the concept of this book but the plot failed to develop as one would expect for a thriller. The characters are interesting but poorly developed and one dimensional. The book was too short for all the characters involved and the plot suffered from lack of develpment. It could have been great, but ended up mediocre."
4,Mission to Mars fanatics...,"For those of you who enjoy reading Mars conspiracy books, this delivers a rather thrilling tale. Tigerman does a nice job of weaving many of the conspiracy theories about life on Mars and hidden secrets into a pretty decent thriller. Some of the characters are a little hokey, but not a bad book. A good read."
4,"A good read, a page turner",The story moves right along and remains exciting almost right up to the end. A few things are not quite believable for the real world of today in which the novel is set but its till a good story.
5,What a ride!,"Charges forward from the first page. More political thriller than sci-fi, this first novel hurtles to a fascinating conclusion. Tigerman's style is cinematic, full of cross-cutting and tight, well-crafted scenes. A terrific first effort! Where's the next one?"
5,Same tracks as When The Gates Swing open,"Do not confuse the title of this album with the LP of 'We Remember Clara Ward'. These are the same tracks of the album 'When the Gates Swing Open' on HOB. I was anticipating the rerelease of the LP but when I received it, I was disappointed that I already had all of the tracks on the above mentioned album. If you do not have the original CD release, I recommend it, but if you think you are getting the LP, be forewarned."
5,A facinating look at a man who helped set things right...,"Juan's engaging and highly readable book may not be a ""comprehensive"" Marshall reference, belabored with extensive footnotes & references, but persons interested in Civil Rights, or American history will find the man Turgood Marshall compelling & complex, and the book enjoyable and very informative."
3,"Good, not Great","A very competent, but not spectacular, biography. Williams does a wonderful job describing Marshall's early court battles, but his handling of the landmark Brown case is lacking, to say the least (20 pages? Come on!). Williams also seems to relish describing Marshall's heavily criticized final years on the bench, constantly refering to reports of Marshall's laziness and ineptitude. But overall, Williams gives a good introduction for those unfamiliar with Thurgood Marshall and his importance."
2,"Very tedious, superficial","Maybe its unfair that I read this book after reading the spectacular autobiography of John Lewis, Walking in the Wind. However, I found that this book was too detached from the man. I did not come away from this book with a better understanding of this man than I did before hand. Thurgood Marshall is one of the most important people of 20th century America but you don't see why in this book.The major problem with this book is its writing style which makes reading this book tedious. I found myself bored by page 200. Also, I believe the Brown decision is given 20 pages and his solcitor general appointment is given more.If you want to learn more about this guy, study the cases of the era. Sweatt v. painter, Brown of course, etc. Marshall's personal life really is irrelevant towards understanding this man's accomplishments. I would not recommend this book."
3,Life of Thurgood Marshall,"Thurgood Marshall, American Revolutionary is a book written about the life of Thurgood Marshall. It is about the life and accomplishments of Thurgood Marshall and how he changed the American court systems forever. I only gave it 3 stars because it had some parts that were dull and repetative. Other then that it was an insiteful book."
5,From a leadership Perspective,"It can be exemplified in the life of Thurgood Marshall, based on this book, what it means to become a leader. It's not something you're born into, but rather something you can be bred into. Thurgood had many factors holding him back (economic, racial, social) but still rose to the challenge and created for him and others the life he wanted. It can serve as inspiration to us all that, although we face many trials in life, let us not be held back by these circumstances. It is outdated that only certain people can be born into leadership roles, but rather it's the decisions and life trials that shape us into leaders. It's not only that, but also how we can harness the experiences life throws and develop these skills into manageable knowledge. Thus allowing people to become leaders."
2,Her worst book,"This is just mho but I thought this book was blah. I read all Amanda Ashley's vampire books and loved them. I just couldn't get into this one. I did not like the heroine Kelly at all. She was almost ""slutty"" compared to Ashley's other heroines and I didn't believe her character to be genuine or real at all. I don't like it when the heroine is more sexually experienced than the hero. ALso this book focused too much on two couples rather than developing a better relationship between the main one. I think back to her older books and this one pales in comparison. I hope she writes another vampire romance in a style that is more like her older ones."
2,Too dull...,"I have read alot of Amanda Ashely's books, but this one fell short of what I expected. I loved Shades of Gray, the prequel, but this one wasn't that great.Edward Ramsey, the vampire-hunter turned vampire, I really like this character, and his struggle to accept his life as a vampire was believable. I'd like to see more of him, but his love-interest, Kelly...I just couldn't get into her. He told her his secret and then changed her into a vampire too quickly, and their romance...well, it just seemed ""forced"".By the middle of the book, I had to force myself to keep reading, by the end, I was glad to finally close it to be done with it.I expected some degree of erotic romance, a little more vampire sensual ""sweep me off my feet"" kind of love, but didn't get it, not in this book.I'm not turned off by Amanda's books and I do intend to keep reading them, it's just this one didn't do it for me."
2,Amateur-ish writing skill,"This is not well written. The characters are fairly 2dimensional, and not much happens for a large part of the book. The plot is not very ambitious, there are wierd lapses in the storytelling (another vampire mentioned halfway through who shows up at a wedding for no reason, as she doesn't know any of the characters and is shortly dispatched) Also, not a new or interesting take on vampire culture. I would pass on this one. Lack of storytelling skills and a basic and uninteresting plot do not a good book make."
3,Okay.,This was a okay book. I think it should have focused more on the main characters (Edward and Kelly). The relationship moved a little too fast with her becoming a vampire too quickly. It wasn't bad but it could have been better.
3,A bit disappointed,"I love Amanda Ashley books. I eagerly waited for the release of this particular book, and it left me feeling slightly disappointed. Sure, the book was worth a read and the price. But the plot was not as thick as her previous novels. I felt it was erratic and loose. It was nice to revisit some of the old characters from previous books. But that was about it. I gave the book 3 stars for effort. Not a bad read at all...just not great either."
2,~ Misleading ~,"I'm not going to rehash the story's plot b/c it's been done. Admittedly, I started reading this book without knowing it had a prequel. The back cover was misleading; I thought it was supposed to be about Ed Ramsey and the woman he loved, Kelly. Unfortunately, their love paled in comparison to Grigori and Marisa's relationship. Kelly seemed like a secondary character throughout the novel while Marisa, Gregori and Ramsey were the front-runners.I enjoyed reading about Ramsey and his trouble adjusting to becoming a new vampire. I also enjoyed all of the parts with Gregori and Marisa. Everything involving Khira (the evil vampire) or the relationship between Ramsey and Kelly fell flat.Overall, it was a simple vampire romance that didn't require much thought. Unfortunately, when you put this book down you'll easily forget it."
5,Legend (Ultimate Edition),"I ""grew up"" loving the Tangerine Dream version of Legend. The soundtrack is so haunting, and listening to it always reminds me of that surrealistic forest Jack and Lilly inhabit. However, the Director's Cut has its own magic. I like the extended sequence when Jack meets Gump and his friends, and has to be tested. The menace of Darkness is enhanced as well. I love both versions of the movie."
1,Garbage of a movie.,"Stupid and dull, poor camera shooting quality. I couldn't even make it quarter way through, amateur. Just plain garbage the makers should pay people to watch this movie."
1,I hated this film.,"I am HUGE fan of Grave Encounters, it is one of the rare movies that I can watch over and over. Grave Encounters 2 was a major let down for me. The biggest let down was the story its self, I found it to be dumb, just plain dumb."
1,This movie was crap.,"I saw the first one & I liked it. So now the same creators that brought you part 1 now brings you this piece of crap of a sequel. Maybe it was just me that was bothered by this but they couldn't go 5 or 10 minutes without dropping an F-Bomb or some cuss word. Seriously what has happened to the horror genre? Too much cussing, too gory or bloodied scenes. Don't get me wrong people like me have the choice to view movies like this 2day. We still enjoy the horror genre but for movies that are going to scare us, not having to sit through an hour & a half for a crappy film. Bring the element of horror movies back which are movies that are meant to give the audience a good scare, do without the constant cussing."
2,Sequels are usually bad... This one doesn't disappoint.,"I am a horror fan. I write horror and film horror movies. I am also a fan of ""found footage/reality"" horror films.When I watched Grave Encounters on Netflix I was really surprised about the acting and effects - great stuff!So when the second was coming out - I had to see it. Bigger budget, better effects.. Win-win right? Wrong! I'm not going to give you the synopsis but I will tell you it takes 50 minutes to get anything scary going and I'm sorry the lead character who plays ""the next horror director"" is terrible on so many levels. His persona on film is ridiculously bad.We are treated with a nice twist with 20 minutes left in the film which leads to some gruesome deaths - which was shocking and really well done but all in all it's not enough to save this movie.Save your money and time. Watch the first one and forget this one ever came out."
3,Scripted Didn't mean better,"I read that the movie was a documentary-style-but-scripted, so I hoped to have more back story either around the characters from the first film or the asylum. Didn't get that but it was an okay movie for frights."
4,Actually a decent sequel,"I never get high hopes for sequels, but this one was pretty decent, I liked the first one cause it made me laugh a bit and scared me good once or twice, and the sequel did the same, a few dumb things, but still interesting and worth watching if you saw the first one."
1,not as good as the first,"really didn't like the direction this sequel took. not really worth it, doesn't add to the lore and not really that scary"
1,I rate it 0 point 0,"Don't waste your time on this movie. The first 40 minutes of it is about stupid kids and their crappy life, parties and other B.S. The rest of it (until the titles start rolling) is based on a very bad plot, with unlikable actors, and average special effects made with nowadays available for everybody, programs. The after titles last minute of the movie was without any scare or whatsoever. Don't believe what the trailer or the cover says. It is NOT! twice as scary as the first movie. It is far worse! I was bored through all of it! Stupid, pathetic, shameless movie! That is all I have to say. Nice attempt to make money! Now I would like to get payed for watching this garbage!"
3,Good but not as good as the first one,"I was surprised I liked the first Grave Encounters as much as I did, but was glad to see a second one available. They spent too much time covering stupid college party scenes for the first 15 minutes, that felt like 2 hours. Just stupid Blair witch camera style stuff. I am a huge horror movie fan and have sat through some BAD ones, and this one was looking like it was going that way. However, it did finally pick up at the point I was about ready to tapout and move on. I won't go into anything that may give the movie away, but if you can get past the pointless beginning, where they could have covered more horror, it isn't too bad. If you liked the first one, then this one is similar enough. I just kept thinking they had a chance to make it as good as the first one and took it back two steps."
3,Grave Encounters 2,"I'm no film critic by any means, nor am I giving a Real review of this film.Decent horror movie, and it had a few good jump scenes in it.THIS FILM IS ON NETFLIX.Screw paying 7 bucks.."
2,Disappointing,We were holding out hope that this would live up to its heritage despite the cheesy plot line and the bad reviews... we should have trusted our common sense. Don't bother!
3,Silly fun,"GRAVE ENCOUNTERS II is very much a retread of material from the first film, as a bunch of college students attempt to determine if the mental-hospital ghostly shenanigans captured on film the first time, gulp, actually happened. Rather than a quality found-footage flick, this movie feels more like someone is filming their friends as they walk through an amusement park maze. The film has imagination, but it's not well-acted, yet who cares? It's a diverting scare for a Friday night."
4,Good enough,"The original Grave Encounters was a great Indy flick, and while GE2 held onto the same basic formula that made GE1 popular, it also tried to ""one up"" the original by showing more of what goes bump in the night after hours in the asylum, which left me feeling a little less scared and a little more disappointed. Sometimes, the scariest thing is that you can't see what is scaring you. All in all it was a good movie, but I wish they had not tried so hard to be another ""king of CGI ghosts""."
4,Very good sequel,"Most negative reviews seem to be from people who didn't finish the movie. Yes, the beginning stuff is kind of long, and events in the hospital build up much faster than in the first movie, but ... Grave Encounters 2 created an interesting and credible ""mythology"" for the series that made it much more interesting than I expected. I thought this would be just another bunch of kids wander in and get killed one by one, but instead the sequel introduces motivation, expands on the insanity of the demonic architecture and adds to the mythos of how the hospital came to be, without telling you so much that a Grave Encounters 3 or 4 would be a waste of time.In short, 1 was better for scares. 2 was better for telling the story in which both movies play a part. I recommend!"
1,Nothing like the first one. Don't waste your money!!!!,My daughter watched the first one and begged me to watch the supposed sequel with her. I paid the $7 and wish I could have a refund. About 5 minutes into it and she was completely confused and disappointed. At minute 8 we turned it off.
2,Don't bother,"We rented this movie because I enjoyed the first GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. Unfortunately, this sequel was a big disappointment and wasn't worth the $6.99 we paid. It starts off introducing the main characters who are college students with scenes of drug use, drinking and sexual behavior. Hey, I am no prude but this was just a blatant statement of ""college is soooo cool because we do all this stuff'. It just made me dislike the characters right away. I won't give any spoilers but they film makers went a bit over the top with added effects that just make the film cheesy. The 'twist' doesn't come at the end but in the second half and I knew what it was before it even happened. If you want to check it out and waste an hour and forty minutes of your life, go ahead but only if it's free."
5,Surprised!!,I Liked it Different than the first but i believe the first one will be my favorite But I would watch this again .
3,didn't last for more than 5 days,"I purchased this racket after seeing good reviews and reasonable price. Its very light weight which some people prefer but I didn't like that.This racket lasted only for 5 days. I played 2-3hrs each day. It was good when I played with plastic shuttlecock. I believe it is the feather cock that teared down its strings.If you are not going to smash or hit hard, it may do well.Amazon Customer service is awesome. I had live chat with customer service and explained that the racket didn't last for more than 5 days. They reshipped another racket at no charge. I'll play with plastic shuttlecock and see how long this racket survives."
3,O.K price to play,It was not good as I expected but the price was O key to play with the item like that. The shipping a little late but still acceptable
2,"Grip fell apart after just couple of uses, beside a good racket for the price","New to the game, bought two for myself and wife. both racket grips fell apart in just couple of games.The rackets are sturdy and light enough for beginners. Overall not a bad buy, just buy extra grips to go along with the racket."
2,Disappointed,I just received the item and I am not happy with the handle because there is no pad. It looks like the cheap one I have at home.
3,Just OK,"There are some mildly inspiring bits. Some good practical advice. Our church is preparing for a sacred assembly. I was looking to be deeply moved in preparation for this event, but didn't really find it here."
4,Not for the littluns,"I bought this calendar for my teenage son. If he were less mature than he is, I would send it back, because it has three images that I judged to be somewhat sexual in nature, although I wouldn't go so far as to say pornographic. Let me just say that some of these ""fairy"" women (or whatever they are) have body parts the size of which you could not find in a field of ripe watermelons. So anyway, if you are the conservative type, or you're buying for a child under 15 or so, you may want to choose something else."
1,Bryan Ferry & Management have pulled this DVD,"Evidently, this DVD release was NOT authorized by either Bryan Ferry or his Management and they have pulled future release of this due to too many omissions. Not only are the releases ""More Than This"" and ""Avalon"" missing, but so are Bryan Ferry's solo releases post 1995. Also, there are more earlier video releases both from Roxy Music & Bryan Ferry that are missing. On top of that, the picture quality is lacking on some of the videos on the DVD. Bryan Ferry is going to release a NEW and COMPLETE version between 2003-2004 with many extras. I would imagine the NEW version that will be released will be like the recent two DVD release by David Bowie which is excellent in every way with every release including rare BBC & Dick Cavett performances. It may be a good idea to avoid this release and wait for the Bryan Ferry AUTHORIZED version."
4,Nice Electrik SoundTrack,"Being a big fan since the early 90s of the appleseed series, i always tried to match music to form it's Soundscape, now here comes along a movie with a decent soundtrack to boot, I'm a huge Detroit Techno fan so seeing a Carl Craig produced track was fuel alone to purchase the Cd but i also liked Atom's white car which has a really deep electronic feel with just a touch of funk. The asian directors of anime really have good taste in music i feel. if your mind is deep enough and not top40 MTV brianwashed this CD is for you."
4,Good music,"I saw the movie and wanted the CD. Now I have it. Now I am happy. I am extremely pleased with the CD, however, it took longer to arrive to me that most of my purchases on Amazon. I did get it though, so I still recommend purchasing from this seller. Thank you for my CD, I LOVE it!"
4,Music review,I thought this CD had good audio quality. There was a broad selection of music which was well played on quality instuments. I would recommend it.
2,The Tubbing came and stays Smashed,"The reason I ordered this vinyl ""tubing"" is because I wanted a circular circumference. It came with having about 25% of its length somewhat smashed and having a oblong circumference shape. I'm letting it lay out hoping that I get a more even circular shape though out the whole tubing; I hope this doesn't take more than a month."
4,Learning Kana with Cards,"My first reaction when I saw the package was, ""Can they be that small?"" Yes! They are small, and a full set of the 51 cards (each of the two alphabets contains 51 cards) fits nicely into my pocket without a huge bulge or weight. In just three days, I've gotten half the harikana memorized and expect that I will be done by the end of the week and ready to start on the next set. I love the convienience of having them always there, ready to use in those wasted minutes in lines and waiting rooms.The characters on the cards are done in very nice calligraphy, which doesn't always match what you will find in printed material. The only negative comment is that the characters formed with the addition of dots or circles (I don't remember the official name!) are lumped five to a card. Simple and easy to use, the ring allows you to re-order the cards so that you don't memorize the actual sequences.I would recommend them to anyone attempting to master these new alphabets."
3,"Good, but not great!!","This novel has a lot of characters. It was very suspensful because Clark keeps you guessing to find out which one of Eliza's admirers is more dangerous. However, The book has a very slow start because nothing really exciting happens until way passed the middle of the novel. It could have been better if more action was involved."
2,Nothing impressive!,"This book was far too tied up in several subplots with way too many characters. And other suspects? There hardly were any! You knew which suspect had done what, thus eliminating suspense. The book does not even get interesting until after about page 300. The story finally gets going then. I would definitely not recommend it!"
3,Predictable,"As with her previous books, I think Ms. Clark has talent as a writer, but her ""suspense"" novels are way too predictable. Throwing in so many other characters didn't give me food for thought about who else it might be...it just confused me and made me have to remember too many people. I'd had the murderer's identity figured out within the first few chapters.Eliza's an interesting character and KEY News is an interesting premise...but it'd be nice to see Eliza have some human characteristics and not be so utterly perfect. With a bit of tightening up, Ms. Clark could really be a top author in her genre."
4,This writer keeps getting better and better!,Close To You is written by one of my wife Jayne's and I favorite writers. Ms. Clark's writing skilles just keep getting better and better.Close To You is a compelling story where being a celebrity may have more than its fair share of dangers as Elizabeth Blake soon discoveres.Close To You is a real page turner everyone will enjoy!
2,"Semi-interesting storyline, but wrapped up way too quickly!","I have read a few MJC books, and all have been better than this one. I have noticed a trend she has: wrapping up the ending of her stories rather abruptly. This is no exception with this book, and was more obvious than her other books, probably because of the predictable plot. The heroine of the story is very likable with an interesting life. However, the reader had no clue to decide for themselves who was the villain until the heroine did right at the end which led to Clark wrapping up every other potential suspect's stories in matters of a few paragraphs. It seemed like Clark was tired of the story and she didn't want to put the effort in to make the ending more realistic and satisfying. If you really want to try a Mary Jane Clark book, I would recommend ""Let Me Whisper in Your Ear"" instead of this one."
2,Good-story wanna-be,"Eliza Blake is a beautiful news anchorwoman who enters your home, and the homes of thousands just like you, every day. For some, this isn't enough. Eliza has multiple ""stalkers"" sending her sick messages in the mail and on her phone. She and her five year old daughter are being threatened and it must end, before someone ELSE dies.This had the makings of a really great story. In my opinion, it just didn't say all it should have. The main character, Eliza, should have done everything in her power to protect herself and her daughter. She really didn't do squat. She simply stood back, making observations. The writing was very predictable and matter-of-fact; I felt no suspense or any other emotions, for that matter. The dialog was very dull and rigid, like the words were simply pulled from a dictionary. I yelled at the book a couple times. You'll need a little patience with this one."
3,Overkill,"The concept of the book was interesting and I tried to get into it. But what I found was too many nutcases and too many bad things happening at once in Eliza's life. It got to the point, where I just would scoff and shake my head. I liked the climax and maybe would have liked it more if I could have felt it was more believable."
1,One of the worst movies I have seen!,"I only bought it, because my brother is in the cast. I send the copy to him. Typical ""C"" movie from Hong Kong."
5,Always Dakota,I enjoyed once again one of Debbie Macombers books ! Great story of a small town and the people who help it grow while helping each other get through hardships and rejoice with each others happiness. Fun to escape to another world which Miss Macomber never fails to deliver. I will continue to enjoy this authors books! What fun!
4,Great follow up book,The characters previously introduced in the earlier books are here along with expanded roles for Margaret and Matt. Lots of interesting dilemmas and decisions.
5,Nice ending to the series,This is the last book in a series which I had gotten at a library sale. I enjoyed being able to finish out the story.
4,A wonderful read!This story will keep your interest,This story will keep your interest from start to finish. The author does an excellent job.
1,Perhaps since I did...,"not read the first two books I made a mistake picking this up. I am stopping around pg 100. There are way too many characters in this book and little background for me to go on and truly, none of the characters seem likable - someone who takes a kid from their home without going through proper legal channels, someone pushing another to marry for $, someone with some severe parenting issues, etc. Not my cup of tea."
1,Dakota Born,It is obvious to a person from North Dakota the author does not know much about North Dakota or the people.
5,Another fine guide book coming from the UK...,Very comprehensible and helpful for those using natural products such as aromatherapy.The author also gives specific guidelines for those who wish to eliminate chemicals from the bath and beauty products..Very intersting reading and a library must have!
4,Cuentos de Hoffman,"Prefiero la versión de 1951 por la bailarina , no obstante es una opera esplendida y no me puedo quejar de los artistas."
3,It's Just Toner,"What can you say? It's just toner, albeit in a reloaded cartridge. I ordered it, it arrived promptly, it was just as advertised, and it works. What more can I ask for. Oh, and it is substantially cheaper than buying new."
1,Only useable if removed from the cartridge,"I have a PowerMac G4 Gigabit Ethernet and bought this to back up my important files only to be unable to initalize it. I had to get help from Apple's discussion board to find out that I have to remove the disc from the cartridge and instructions on how to do it. The other posters also described a high rate of failure for Memorex DVD-RAM discs so I recommend you getting another brand, even if it costs a bit more."
3,Not a bad CD,"""I Like it That Way"" is a soulful R&B recording much in the style of the late Otis Redding. In fact, Nulisch covers Redding's ""Trick or Treat"" on this disc. The tunes are laid back, laced with horns and keyboard and, for the most part, is generally well done. It's a little too laid back for me, but again, its not a bad effort."
4,A good but schizophrenic fantasy,"The first half of the misleadingly titled, ""Prospero's Children"" is wonderful and scary, choc-a-block with evil villians (a witch, an idol, and an art gallery owner) and eccentric good guys (the Watcher, a female werewolf, a house goblin). The second half of the book is standard Swords and Sorcery. It's almost as if the publisher said, ""Okay, Jan, this is great but we need another 100 pages and a better title."" I'd give the first half five stars and the second half two stars, then round high just because I loved the Watcher, the idol, and the witch."
4,Charming and Disturbing,"I usually don't expect much from books I pick up at the supermarket, so _Prospero's Children_ came as a very pleasant surprise. The writing is beautiful -- sort of a mix of Charles DeLint and Madeline l'Engle with a dash of C.S. Lewis thrown in for the English-ness of it. The characters are realistic, and there is enough humour thrown in the cast a light in the darkness._Prospero's Children_ joins a number of recent books that refuse to downplay the seriousness of ""children's"" experiences, and some people may have difficulty with it for that reason. Although I hesitate to label it as a coming of age story, one of the major themes is the main character's throwing off the patterns of youth and emerging into the uncertainty of young adulthood. In that light, the downfall of Atlantis can be seen as a symbol for the lost paradise of childhood -- a paradise which, when examined closely, turns out to be not so wonderful at all.A poignant and moving tale."
2,Could have been Better,"There are elements of fantasy and some romance however, the writing style made this a difficult read. I was disappointed by the ending, or lack there of of one. The first half, although poorly written, did seem to be building up to a climatic finish. Unfortuantely, the second half of the book, contained more undeveloped characters and a story line that went in too many directions and had an unclear ending. Really disappointing considering that the story line look really promising."
2,Weird and boring,"This book is written in such a strange lyrical fashion that I thought I was hallucinating parts of it. I kept going back to re-read sections to see if I'd imagined the odd passages and chapters, but no, I hadn't. This Jan Siegal has no skill at all in making fantasy seem real, she just makes it seem like all of her charecters are dreaming throught the entire book. And to make it worse, she tries to pass these books off as seriouse fantasy with language and other indexes from Atlantis!Look at the author photo in the back of the book. See how concited the author looks? Well, thats how her writing comes across, as concited. I really wish I'd trusted the reviews on this more, because I couldn't even finish the first book and Now I'm stuck with all three! yeesh!Two stars-I did not like this book at all."
3,Very Imaginative beginning trilogy.,This is the first novel by Jan Siegel. Grabs me right from the start. Seems to get get clouded with over descriptive terms at times which seems a lil much at times. Characters seem to just pop up out of nowhere without proper introduction of thier origins which takes away from the believability of them. The ending gets exciting. Story is still a recommended read for a fan of fantasy. I will read the next book in this series for sure. I have a feeling the second will be much better.
3,Book Of Two Halves,"The start of this book reminded me of those old ITV/BBC childrens dramas,dealing with remote mythical houses,standing stones,which were made in the seventies/sixties.There is a ring of Alan Garner in here,the smell of Mythago Wood,and a touch of the British/Celtic myth cycle.But as soon as the door to Atlantis is opened,the flood,literally washes all before it away,and you are left with very much the feeling of having read,two books.The children are Alan Garners,the setting is Robert Holdstocks,but the ending ?"
4,A British writer with a Folklore story,"Jan, like a lot of British writers, has a folktale style about a young girl and her family. You can almost break it down into traditional folk tale elements. Which means it is plot driven but the characters are very real and colorfull. You find yourself involved with their lives and you care about them. I find myself immersed in the beauty of the tale.Fern is a 16 year old girl that finds herself drawn into a fantasy world of children that she denied herself when she was younger because she needed to take care of her family. The tale sweeps through london york and eventually atalantis where it comes to a full circle. You find yourself believing in the land of the little people and that magic does exist.It is also a metaphor about what we lose when we become adults. I read a lot of fantasy and would love to believe in the world of fairies and spirits. I enjoyed this book to its fullest and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Hrm...mixed bag...,"I just (like 5 minutes ago) finished reading _Prospero's Children_ and don't know what to make of it. The first half of the book was wonderfully weird and creepy...but then the second half kicked in with a jarringly abrupt change...and, well, it felt like the beginning of a completely different book. Fern? Fern, is that you, girl? 'Cause you sho ain't actin' like the Fern I met earlier... o_OOne last thing: While I do love descriptive novels, this went overboard sometimes. Yes, YES, I GET that the storm is very black and grey and ominous, I don't need 15 different adjectives and 20 similies to get the pic! But I digress...I DO admire what Ms. Siegel did with the plot and despite being too verbose at times, her imagination IS incredible. An entertaining, though not excellent, read."
3,Started great but disappointing end,"The first half was imaginative and the heroine really caught my interest. The second half sank into a tawdry love story a la harlequin romances, complete with a 16 year old losing her virginity to an older man on a beach. I was disappointed-the brainy and thoughtful heroine of the first half disappeared in the second as her hormones took over."
4,Prospero's Children,"I picked up this book a few weeks ago, and although it was not the best book I've read in my life, I enjoyed it. Jan Siegel writes intriguingly...there are so many details and the words are so intricate. Each character also has so many different characters in themselves, and I love the feeling I get from the descriptions of their house in Yorkshire. But I picked the book up on what I read on the back, about Atlantis and such. The book, for most of the first half, doesn't mention anything of the sort, although there are slight clues as to the future. I liked the way the book was written, but the plot did not intrigue me. I recommended this book to a fantasy loving friend, and she loved it very much. I like the meanings and descriptions I found in this book, but I have to say I was not blown away. This was not a bad book, and I believe it is worth reading."
4,What goes around comes around,That is absolutely what I appreciated the most about this book. I will admit it took me two tries to actually finish the book. The first time I picked it up I could barely understand what was happening; but if you'll stick on to the very last page it all makes sense. There was a wonderful if sad finality to this novel that I throughly enjoyed once I muscled my way past the beginning!
3,Beautiful until I hung it up!,"This item was shipped (even arrived 4 days early) and was packaged perfectly! It is absolutely even more beautiful in person than the picture displayed. I am very happy with the Red Carpet Studios Spiral Tunes Wind Chime! Well worth the price I paid. Very happy 1st time customer! :) Edited version is now that I've actually hung it outside it is crooked! It was packaged very nicely, looked great until again today I hung it up. I cannot stand something crooked and this is tilted, no way to fix it. I still like it from a distance but I'm PO'd that it is hanging the way it is. Still the best out of three that I purchased. The other two were crap."
1,Misleading photograph,The photo shown for this product is for the high-back version. What you will receive is the low-back version (not shown).
2,Gore Vidal...what do you expect?,"I agree with Seaside, Ca. He's dead on and the Hamlet characterization couldnt be more accurate.Is there some reason Hollywood cant get Billy the Kid right? This one was just as bad as Peckinpah's offering, and every bit the worst western of the 50's. Actually, I have no words. Read the guy below...apparently I'm the one that's traumatized."
5,FANTASTIC PARTY GAME,"I recently received Malarky as a gift from a friend. We had a group of friends over this past weekend and we pulled out the game. This was our first Malarky experience and it was the hit of the night. Fun, challenging and a great way to out wit all my smart friends.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a fun night at home with friends or famly."
3,"Great concept, awkward execution","We enjoyed the idea behind this game, but the process of playing did not flow smoothly. The game needs to be simplfied and streamlined, eliminating the bulky folders and reduced to a pack of cards. But it would be difficult to charge (...) for a pack of cards!"
4,MALARKY is fun for the whole family!,There are basically no flaws in the game. It will keep everyone guessing and laughing and its cheap too.
5,Be a good liar to play!,"This game is fantastic for those of use who exagerate the truth, make up stories for entertainment, or just plain invent lies. What a great crowd warmer game. One person has the ""real"" answer, and the rest of us concoct and manuver ourselves around making our answer sound real. Be prepared to laugh, argue and have a BLAST! Highly recommended for adults. Clean and fresh humor!"
2,Malarky not up to Balderdash's Standards,"We had trouble sorting out the rules. Then we had trouble scoring. Finally, we had trouble determining who the winner was, and why he/she had won. Some of the questions were too easy, enabling several people to offer close-to-correct answers, making it virtually impossible to sort out who was bluffing, who had the original question, etc.The single benefit Vs. Balderdash is that Malarky allows the ""host"" player to guess along with the others. Balderdash (regular or super) offers the advantage of written answers, so there is no doubt who said what. Strategy is immediately clear when playing Balderdash; this was not the case with Malarky.In sum, the questions are cute; the game is not."
1,Won't play again,"I love board games, but this one was truly not very fun. The pressure of coming up with a verbal answer to the questions detracted from the fun of making up definitions- The game favors people who are good at lying on the spot. We played with a large group, and we honestly found the questions to be a little too dull or technical. Example: ""Why do McDonald's Hamburger buns have a white circle on the bottom."" This answer, along with the majority of others, has to do with the way the product is manufactured. Soon, everyone was forced to start coming up with dull explanations about conver belts, ovens, air flow, etc- not very fun. Next time we'll play something else."
5,Malarky must be the funniest game we've ever played.,"My father is an absolute whacko. The bluff answers he came up with made us think that he lost it. Why are manhole covers round? Why do dogs smell funny when they get wet? Why do women go to the restroom together?Like the other reviews, stated, we absolutely laughed our heads off. To try to summarize, this is like Balderdash but so much faster and funnier."
5,A great game at a great price.,"Patch Products has put together a game that is sure to be a family favorite. Malarky is the game, based on the Book IMPONDERABLES, which entertain, amaze and even educate you for hours. The whole family can be involved in this one.The rules are easy to follow and understand, there is no real confusion on any explanation. The scoring process is a bit complicated, but after a few rounds it becomes easier to understand. You do not have to know every answer to every question, you just have to be the one everyone else believes.The game is fast paced and learning to bluff is a the key to winning. The game has great questions, which are not only thought provoking, they are also very funny in some cases. The game allows everyone the chance to bluff his or her way to victory.There were a couple to typographical errors in the instructions, but nothing that will keep you from catching on the rules of the game."
2,Not as fun as the reviews make it seem,"Bought this game last Christmas for my family. We have family game night often and love Apples to Apples, Quelf (hilarious!), Telestrations, Scattegories and many others. Bought this after reading the reviews and it's been disappointing. Not very funny or engaging. Only played it a few times and it's been sitting in the closet ever since."
2,Scoring is confusing and play is just so-so,"I love to read the Imponderable series of books. But I did not enjoy the game. I agree with the few brave souls that that said they did not enjoy it either. We only played with 4 people, and sometimes there are only so many answers you can make up with out being exactly the same or so outrageous that you don't get any points. But, I think the hardest part was when you actually got the true answer and according to the rules, not repeat it exactly but still get the point across. Sometimes the real answer was so technical or convoluted that you couldn't possibly give the answer with out everyone knowing that it was the right one. That's no fun. Side note: Do you want your kids to practice lying?"
5,Always a delight.,"I am a big Rumpole fan. (Obviously, or I wouldn't be buying DVD's of the series.) As always, Rumpole is fun, interesting and even insightful into the many aspects of the British legal system. Rumpole is always a delight."
3,Cheesy A&E can't be bothered with captioning,"The picture is wonderful, but I don't understand why there is no closed captioning. I know the last episodes when shown on PBS had it, but that's A&E for you - won't add captioning. Too bad HBO in conjunction with Warner Brothers didn't continue putting the Rumpole series out on DVD. Then we'd have captioning. I'm glad my set one is the HBO/WB set, as THAT at least is captioned."
5,Rumpole of the Bailey,"Leo McKern is perfect in this role and these stories are addicting.Rumpole of the Bailey, Set 3 - The Complete Seasons 5, 6 & 7"
2,Good amateur novel written by a high school student,"Debbie Mack has definitely seen a lawyer - on TV. Or met one - at a wedding, perhaps. Or talked to one - on the phone, for 5 minutes. MAYBE. And her knowledge of the law could be written on a napkin. A small one. A very small one.The writing is ok. The characters are well developed BUT this book could have been so much better.There are holes that a mac truck could be driven through (with several trailers).About as realistic as Snow White."
4,Good read and excellent first effort,"I didn't realise this was Debbie Mack's first novel. Whilst I agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters are a little forgettable this is an excellent book. Sam (the heroine) has ""legs"" and I am sure will grow if Ms. Mack decides to write more featuring this character. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more by this author."
2,Boring!!,"Boring to say the least! Characters are not well-connected, story plot is confusing with too many people making to many twists and turns, making it hard to follow the story. Plot does not seem to take any particular direction, making this reader lose interest quickly."
4,GREAT First Novel,"The main character, Sam, is a unique character in every sense of the word. Debbi Mack makes each and every character come alive, and every scene is vividly described so that the reader feels like he or she can easily visualize the place. The mystery was well played out, but the strength of the book was in the characters. It creates a need in the reader to find out what Sam et al will do in the next book, and all future books starring Sam. Excellent first book-- already downloaded the second."
2,Not a page turner,"Slow and never really went anywhere. The concept is interesting but I think the way the book was written took all the drama away, no pop. The main character is a lawyer, the author could have used that to add a legal thriller component which could have really helped the book but that angle wasn't pursued. Disappointing."
5,A MUST Read!,I'm a Sue Grafton fan and absolutely fell in LOVE with this book! I'm looking forward to reading more about Sam in future books!
4,good,good book - it was an easy read - I recommend itit does not need additional words to describe it
3,Ehhh,It was ok. I thought it could have had a bit more explanations on how things came together. It was good for entertainment.
3,A Decent Series Debut,"I felt this book was an average mystery with a touch of suspense. It did not get intense enough to really grab me hard. I think part of that was I did not feel terribly connected to any of the characters.That said, it was en enjoyable enough book that I will likely read the next book in the series, Least Wanted.The Kindle edition did not have chapter markers. The chapters flowed together, causing many odd breaks with my usual text setting. Minor complaints though. Otherwise the formatting and text was clean. The last 15% of the file contains the first three chapters of two different books, one being the follow-up Least Wanted and one by another author."
5,Sam McRae Is a Welcome Addition,"Sam McRae is a welcome addition to the community of tenacious female lawyers. The plot kept me guessing until the end, the characters were well developed and left me wanting to see more of them (and wondering if one of them becomes a love interest), and Sam was neither too cute nor too stupid (my pet peeves for female protagonists). I'm looking forward to more from this series."
3,Thin but not bad,"This is a very short book with a plot that is not much developed. One woman wronged in the distant past is very believable. But two is a crowd. There is a mob connection that is not credible: a near death by torture is followed immediately by business as usual, before a deus ex machina (a car crash) eliminates this thread.The identity theft theme is not developed well. It is a good idea to build a plot around this new, scary and ubiquitous crime. The author should have taken the time and energy to learn something about identity theft, to add some meat. This is a salad book, not a meat and potatoes book.I think it is worth buying at the Kindle price by those who like mysteries."
2,Why bother?,"This is the sort of book I call a ""why bother?""-book. While not exactly bad, it has really nothing to recommend it and make it stand out from the mass of average writing flooding amazon every day. All the characters and especially the heroine felt like they were living behind a glass wall where you cannot get a grip on them. I could not sympathise, let alone identify, with any of them.SPOILER!I liked the idea of the wanted suspect actually being the murder victim, although I feel this could have been made more of. On the other hand I thought it totally unbelievable that the heroine gets beaten up so bad she has to be hospitalized and no one - not a one! - asks her what has happened to her and why. Totally unrealistic, as this would be the first thing anybody would ask."
