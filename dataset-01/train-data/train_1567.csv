5,oh my gawd like WOAH!,This band is like ... THE BEST! there is no other way to describe them. i saw there video on MTV2 and i fell in love! they make me wanna boogie like no other. there CD is RAD! anyone who doesnt like them needs to gt poked in the eye!
4,ima robot?,"ok, people say ima robot sounds like devo with something else. well, ima robot is a complete copy of a great punk band called ""the dickies"". despite this, i really enjoyed the album. if you like this album, try ""the dickies"" on for size and judge for yourself!"
4,A Well-Titled Album,"After Steve Marriott ditched the Small Faces, the three remaining members (Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, and Kenny Jones) joined up with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, formerly of the Jeff Beck Band, to make this record.Though credited to the ""Small Faces,"" it's best understood as the first record of the new band, the Faces. And it is an appropriately-titled record, for it is a first step for this new band. Classic Faces tunes like Three Button Hand Me Down and their kick-butt remake of Dylan's Wicked Messenger are diluted by some obvious filler, like Pineapple and the Monkey. On the next two records -- Long Player and A Nod's As Good As A Wink -- the filler would go and all that would be left is essential rock-and-roll.If you're new to the Faces, get those discs first then circle back to First Step."
4,first step,"This was a First Step indeed. The First step the Faces took after dismantling the Small faces and rock n Roll was all the better for it. This was the first of a string of great faces and Rod Stewart solo records. It didnt last long. Both were basically gone from the rock n roll scene by 1974, but it was great while it lasted"
4,Good first effort,"Considering Rod & Ronnie had just joined the band after leaving Jeff Beck,I thought this was a good first effort with the band just getting together.The Faces were known mostly for their live shows and hard drinkin rock&roll; life style."
3,Just a hint of what was soon to follow...,"""Around The Plynth"" (later to become a slide guitar workout for Ron Wood in his live shows and sometimes incorporating ""Gasoline Alley""), ""Flying,"" and ""Three Button Hand Me Down"" are the strongest tracks here. This is the sound of a band seeking out a new identity...Rod Stewart had nothing in common with original singer Steve Marriott beyond the ability to let loose with a raspy howl, and the Keef-riffing of Ron Wood brought in a heavier hand than the one that guided songs like ""Itchykoo Park."" The next album (""Long Player""), as sloppy as it was, got a little closer to the band that would ultimately record their masterpiece ""A Nod Is As Good As A Wink."" This album really is a First Step...not a bad one, just a 3-star one."
3,Ok,The songs are ok on this cd and Rod's voice is great as always. I persnally like him better when he went on his own.
5,Refreshing,"These guys are so talented. It's real music written from the heart with some real awesome melodies and harmonies. It's definitely like one of the previous reviewers stated, ""A breath of fresh air."" You won't be disappointed!"
3,Average,"Nothing great to listen to. It has a feel of a group of friends cutting up and having a good time, but not polished."
3,does not stand up to the accolades,"I was looking forward to some grooving bluegrass and indie rock mix and was greeted by lame, slow mediocrity. not was I was expecting considering all the hoopla. unfortunately wasted my cash, now the CD is a bb gun target... at least I got some value from it. so sad to find such mediocrity."
4,gator blades,"I ordered a new pair of gator blades and they were delivered promptly, in perfect condition, and performed exactly as advertised. I am delighted with the cut from these blades."
5,Solved my water problems!,"This water eater is a great product. I have had trouble in the past with water from near my bathtub and under my aquarium leaking occasionally and going to the apartment below, much to my embarrassment. Now I know that this product will absorb the water and then dry out with no odor. Solves the problem for me!"
1,"Soppy Mess, Doesn't Work","I really wanted this product to work, since my below grade entrance gets a shallow coating of water every time it rains. I placed Mr.Quick Wick at the entrance and it absorbed about as much water as a sponge of the equivalent size would, enough to make it soppy but not enough to prevent the water from creeping past it. After the rain, the product is slow to dry out and keep clean, and looks like a drowned worm while the water slowly seeps out. It also has a slimy feel when wet, making wringing it out unpleasant."
2,It oozes!,"I recently had a chance to see these in action as we had a very heavy rain storn. While they did absorb some of the water in the basement, the storm was over a week ago and they are still not dried out - good thing we haven't had any more heavy rain. I hung them up to dry and they oozed some kind of slimey stuff all over the floor and my hands when I picked them up. Most of the ""stuffing"" has migrated to the ends I have hanging down & they are still wet & dripping slime!"
3,OKAY,This product does what it says for the most part....just dont expect it to last that long depending on how much water you need it to stop....okay product for the price....
2,Absorbs...BUT,"This little item did absorb the water leaking from a faulty shower door frame (now repaired), but it then provided its own leakage on the bathroom floor--a nice brown hue. Not pretty."
4,"I had to read it for school, and I loved it!","There ain't much left for me to say, if you didn't read the book yourself. But, for as far as I can judge the book, I'd give it four stars. Let's first introduce myself. My name is Heleen de Zeeuw and I'm a sixteen year old girl from The Netherlands. For my subject English I had to read an English book. I choose this one, cause I'd become interested in King Arthur when I saw the film 'First Knight'. I do say that (as far as I've read the book) I prefere the movie, but the book was good too. That's all folks!"
4,Pretty Good Book,"I found this a good book with superb detail, but this is meant to be a childrens novel. It was often hard to read . Overall, it was a pretty good book."
3,Retold one time too many?,"I had to overcome having read one too many retellings of these tales in reading this book.I think the major flaw is taking the late middle ages Christian approach.On the plus side the author pretty much sticks to the classic story lines and even puts in the Tristam legend(his undoing here as the Cornwall Kingdom is where Arthur's mother conceived him, not a a place out of time ).He changes Vivian to Nimue and calls magic the deceptions of Merlin and Morgan le Fay making everything as the Christians of later times would have it."
1,Totally Lost!!,"I read this book for English class,it was required. I suppose if you were a really good reader, and were into the old mythilogical tales, you would really enjoy this book. When i read this i got sooo lost it was just to ""scattord"" In one seen K.A. is here then the next he is in war, then some person dies. I just feel enless you are really interested in the book,or the idea should you read it. Under my reccomentaion, don't waste your time when there are MILLIONS of other good books out there. Hey!, its all up to you..."
3,Buy this edition for the art only,"Despite what the ""Editorial Reviews"" section of this page would lead you to believe this is *not* Roger Lancelyn Green's altogether superior version of the Arthurian Legends. The Illustrated Junior Library edition is a handsome book with pretty illustrations, but the text is virtually incomprehensible, even to a literate, educated adult, let alone kids. It is riddled with archaisms and convoluted grammar, and would turn any young kid off to the Matter of Britain in a heartbeat. Read them Green's version first. Buy and enjoy this edition only for the art - it is not going to get read much."
2,The Knights of the Round Table,"The Knights of the Round TableBy: Roger Lancelyn GreenThe book King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table include numerous interesting stories. The author, Roger Green, did not only set Arthur on quests, but his knights too. From the adventure of the Green knight to the quest for the Holy Grail, this book keeps you entertained. The king Arthur and his knights were well known for their bravery and honorability. For example, Sir. Gawain kept his promise to the green knight to look for him in one year.However, the old English and the number of characters in the many stories of this book become very confusing.I rate this book five out of ten, because I enjoy more descriptive action stories rather than so much talking. I recommend this Arthurian novel to whoever enjoys stories rich in characters and dialogs."
4,A dignified and beautiful introduction to the legends,"I have loved the tales of Camelot since I was quite small. Due to this, several friends have asked me where they should begin. Over and over again, I recommend Green. His work is not majestic like Malory, but much easier to read and follow, especailly for a neophyte. Children love it, as do adults; this book gives the basic nobility of the tales, giving a good clue as to why they've been so popular for so long. Green also includes several tales of Sir Gawain, so he is not the near-felon he seems in several late medieval texts. The books is charming, moving, sad, happy, and everything else you could wish from Camelot. If you haven't read of Arthur before, begin here; if you want to remember why you loved these tales to begin with, read Green. He provides more than you would ever expect."
3,Great story for the older reader,"This is a classic story, but I would definitely recommend an older reader enjoying this. Even if reading this to a child, the wording is old english and unfamiliar to some readers. To make the story understandable, I needed to stop and explain the story at times."
5,Arthurian Legends Are for Everyone,"As a teacher, and Arthurian Legend enthusiast, I have found these tales applicable to both middle, and high school students. Timeless stories of chivalry and honor accurately retold by Green excited students, who devoured chapter after chapter of guts and gore, evenly balanced with heroic knightly deeds. In the end students wanted more, and sought other titles independently. Note: TH Lawrence's Sword in the Stone is not an ample substitue. Students found it to be trite, childish, and laborious. It does however demonstrate how authorial interpretation of original plotlines can make or break a story. This book is worth the money."
4,A magnificent collection of Round Table stories,"I read King Aurthur and his Knights of the Round Table this summer and I found it to be genuinely interesting. Each step to reaching the height of Logres was well worded and every story allowed me to picture exactly what was happening in my head. Although I thought the ending was sad, it did not take away from the novel as a whole and I would recomend it to anyone who enjoys mythical stories."
4,Good introduction to courtly age,"Dozens of tales comprise the legend of King A. This author compiles about 23 and fashions them into a cohesive story, showing the rise of King A., the age of the glory of his realm, the quest for the Holy Grail, and the realm's fall. Most of the tales are episodic; they can stand on their own, as well as a functioning part of the legend. Everyone's favorite knights are here: Launcelot, Galahad, Gareth, Tristam, Percivale, evil Sir Mordred, and dumb Sir Kay. Also, the ladies: Queen Guin, Morgana le Fay, Enid, and Blanchefleur. My favorite Knight is Sir Gawain, and favorite tale is that of him and his Lady Ragnell. Well laid out, an easy read, and a good introduction to the courtly age."
1,Same Old Stuff,"Nothing new here....same old rah-rah. Basic and quite general motivational techniques that never change....same stuff, different author. Save your money."
4,Luke Vibert '- Lover's Acid,"A compilation of Vibert's 12""s released on Planet Mu, LOVER'S ACID mixes his Wagon Christ sense of weird fun with 303 lines for a rollicking good time. The slow shuffle of ""Funky Acid Stuff"" seems like a perfect example of this, and even if ""Analord,"" ""Acid2000,"" and ""Come On Chaos"" are a slightly more traditional acid tracks, they still carry Vibert's unique sensibility. The bongo mellowness of ""Gwithian"" contrasts the more upfront beats of ""Prick Tat"" or the rough ""Dirty ****er."" But things get back to perky with ""Flyover."" Fun and innovative use of one of the most recognizable sounds from electronic music."
3,"Another Martini, please...","I can't recommend this record to anyone unfamiliar with Tindersticks. This soundtrack serves only the purpose of the film its in and almost all songs, listened without the imagery behind it, seem shattered and loose, although the opening titles might misguide you about the conception of the whole record. Just for Tindersticks' fans or for those who own a bar and are looking for music that is heard only by costumers who become introspective while drinking martinis."
1,Fun while it lasted,"We bought this volleyball set for our pool. We enjoyed it after the initial set up, but were disappointed when the net actually began falling apart after only a couple of weeks. I am not sure if it was caused by being out in the sunlight or pool chemicals, but the net actually became so brittle that it actually would break into tiny pieces as we attempted to retie or tighten the net. I'd only purchase this if you had plans to remove it from the outdoor elements when not in use."
3,I think Kathy's great but this video isn't,"I have owned this video for over a year. I have done it twice. I gave it a second chance. The workout is clipped together, it's quite dated, and you are apt to injure yourself on some of the aerobic with weigh segments if you're not careful!"
5,Love it!,"I've been doing home workouts for 2 years now, and I started with Tae Bo, but got bored. I read the reveiws on Kathy's videos, and this was one of the first ones I tried. I LOVE IT! It's just fun! Sure, some parts are a little cheesey, but that's what keeps me going. It's intense, without being overly serious, and everyone on the tape isn't some hard-body piece of perfection. They seem like normal people who are in shape and just like to have fun working out. The moves vary from simple to dance-type moves, which are my favorite. I actually lok forward to coming home from work to exercise, and now I have almost ALL of Kathy's videos!"
4,Pretty Good Cardio,"This cardio is really good. (60 minutes) The arm toning is decent, but not overdone. If you want more arm workouts, do the Firm or something. The thighs were good. The only problem I have with a lot of Kathy Smith tapes is that she doesn't pay much attention to isolating the inner thigh. Other than that, this is a non stop hard workout. Not for beginners if you're just beginning to get back into shape after a huge lull. But it's good for intermediates. And yes, the editing is a little off, but the workout is good enough to compensate for it."
2,Kath Smith Weight Loss Workout,"I have several of Kathy Smith's tapes, this is the only one I do not like. I have used it about 4 times now, and I improve with keeping up, but the tape doesn't get any better. I don't feel that I really work the muscles, it is more of an aroebic dance routine tape. I have knee and ankle problems and this tape could be damaging to both if I'm not careful. So, while I try to watch my moves, Kathy moves on to something else. I also think the editing could have been 1000 times better. Kathy's ""Functionally Fit"" and ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight"" are much better choices for the money. If you are into this for the weight loss and muscle toning go with one of those. If you just need to get your heart rate up and enjoy dance routines you might like this one. I didn't."
5,Fab Workout for All Levels,"This is an excellent, fun workout that gets you moving and even smiling. Kathy Smith is motivating and, well, down right perky. The music is alright (could be better, but not bad). The moves are easy to follow.I'm an advanced exerciser, specifically in aerobics, and I sweat like I haven't in months. But don't let that discourage you; Smith shows different versions to cater to your personal fitness level. Fellow advanced exercisers: be warned that the weight segment will probably only fatigue your muscles enough to maintain status quo.By the end I was feeling great and in a terrific mood. This video is definitely a worthy investment."
1,kathy smith weight lose workout,"Don't buy this tape unless you like aerobics from the 80's. This tape has a new jacket, but is a old tape."
1,Outdated,"I was very disappointed with my recent purchase of this tape. It is very outdated! It's OK if you're stuck in the 80's. The cover shows a recent photo of Kathy, which is misleading advertising as far as I'm concerned. I was hoping that this tape would motivate, but it is very similar to some of Kathy's older tapes that I do not use any longer."
3,Ugh! The Way the Tape is Shot Makes the Workout Unbearable!,"This tape was edited in a completely butchered way. Throughout the workout there are closeups of Kathy's face and it will switch over to a different backdrop to show the same workout but with the leaders in different outfits. This choppy setup makes it very hard to focus on the actual workout. The workout itself is not that bad, but is way too gimicky. Ditch this tape and get Peak Fat Burning and Fat Burning Breakthrough instead!"
2,AWFUL!!!,"I thought, like the other person that commented, that this was a new workout, since there is a 2003 production date on the DVD. It is outdated, hard to follow, and generally a waste of time. I did give this review 2 stars because of the upper body workout, which is somewhat worthwhile, but it goes so fast and is so confusing due to the stupid camera angles that I didn't feel like I was really getting a good workout."
4,Good variety of workouts!,"I really enjoy this video. The segments are all really different, ranging from light weights, to ""real aerobics"", to a couple dancey-numbers, the last one of which really gets my heart rate up, but I hardly notice b/c it's fun to do! At first, I found that some of the choreogrpahy was hard to catch onto, not because it was difficult, but because the camera was in the wrong place at the wrong time. (This, and the music made me subtract one star from an otherwise terrific workout.) Once I""~ caught on, I got a much better workout."
3,Didn't love it,"I liked the duration of this workout--I was definitely tired at the end. However, I found most of the music and the workout partners uninspiring. I could also live without the cutouts of Kathy ""bloopers"" (I think?). Generally, I had a tough time following a lot of the moves too. The last number was a ton of fun--I expect it to grow on me more when I learn the steps better."
2,Disappointing,"I love other Kathy Smith videos, but I'm really disappointed in this one. I find it hard to get past the cheesy props and big hair. The aerobics moves are OK, but I found myself watching the clock, hoping I wouldn't have to look at the big hair much longer. The weightlifting part is the redeeming part of this video. I'd suggest sticking with her time-savers series and the fat burning breakthroguh video."
2,1 hr of horrible 50's clothes and 80's stuff...Yuck!!,I bought this video because I believed Kathy Smith to be an expert. I have read her advice in Self magazine many times and it seemed she knew what she was talking about. This video was horrible! The sets were cheesy and they seemed to care more about special effects than exercising. It was distracting to see them exercising in one set of clothes and in one setting then flash mid step to another set up. I am completely angry that I wasted my hard earned money on this one.
2,"80""s Stuff - cover misleading",I was very disappointed when I bought this tape. It seems like Kathy Smith compiled several clips of her workout tapes all of them in the 80's and made it into 1 hr tape.. I felt really disappointed since it is 2001 - why would I want old stuff give use something new to work with. I wish Kathy Smith would have been more honest to her consumers. I feel it's a waste of my money.
2,I Thought Kathy Smith Could Do No Wrong But...,"I Thought Kathy Could Do No Wrong But...I am a huge Kathy Smith follower, but this video was a waste of money! It's not only because of the fact that the settings were extra cheesy, but the weight segments were way too easy and there were not enough of them. If you want a good aerobic workout this is the video for you (minus the horrible clothes and music), but for serious areo toning this is not a good workout. I think this video should have been discontinued in the late 1980s!!"
5,The perfect long song.,"Shanaya Twain, you're the best. This is the best love song I've heard. My friend will sing ""From This Moment On"" at my wedding (October 16) just as I exchange my vows, because it's exactly what I feel in my heart. I think this is the ""Perfect"" long song and most appropriate for a wedding."
5,Your Still The One,"I have been listening to Shawnia for a really long time and I love her songs so much! She rocks! My favorite song is Your Still The One because it makes me think of someone special and important in my life, thats why im choosing 5 stars for this song and for Shawnia. I hope you all have her as a #1!"
5,The sweetest love song ever written.,"I think this is one of the greatest love songs every written and sung. But then again there is always ""still the one""...hmmm. Shania truely knows what love songs are all about. Tenderness so sweet it hurts.."
5,One of the best wedding songs I have ever heard!,"Ms. Twain's delivery of this song is fantastic! I am currently planning an April wedding and knew from the ""moment"" that I heard this song that it would be in my ceremony somewhere. I have decided to use it as my recessional walk after we take our vows. It says everything that I ever wanted to say to my future husband. Thank you Tony for all that you have given me."
3,I can't believe it!,"I was looking for the cd with both versions of ""From This Moment"" The one she sings by herself and the one with the duet with Bryan White. I read a review on here, and someone said it did have both so I bought it. I wanted to have both so I could decide which one to use for my first dance song at my wedding. The cd only has the From This Moment song as a solo by shania."
3,Instrumental version of From this Moment,Did anyone find the instrumental version? My wedding is coming up in February.
4,"Solid, but not stunning","My first exposure to the Wildwoods was their 2002 album, ""Back Country Road,"" which is simply stunning. I was surprised to find you that this earlier album is merely an okay-sounding bluegrass gospel set, with some really nice harmonies, but kind of muted, low-key picking backing them up. Not as much spark and fire on this album, although it's still very good and very solid. Worth checking out, though their next album will blow your mind!"
2,Cheesy buttrock at its finest,"I heard this disc thru a friend who told me that these guys were selling the disc online. I did'nt believe him. But here it is and here is my review. Though I have heard much worse, this is basically 80's metal rehashed. Cheesy songs with grandiose vocals. Obviously, there is a certain degree of musicianship. However, the musicians are not the problem, the songs are. Do these guys really take themselves seriously??? If they do not, then I give them 2-and-a-half stars. Guys-Don't quit your dayjobs!"
2,Disappointing,"This video disappoints... the footage of the actual eruption is missing entirely. Basically this video was pieced together from a series of prime time ABC News segments. None is of sufficient length to keep the subject in focus. Although the subject is interesting, unless you have a specific interest in how it was covered by the ABC News, you'll find better material elsewhere."
3,Must read for the series proly but just ok.,LOved the first book and wish i would of read these reviemws and was aware from the get go that this is a book of short stories. Once i got that I enjoyed the book much more. Last chapter was great and made all the other stuff worth it.
2,too much bad action,"I bought this book, because I think that I would get a lot of action and war fighting.......which I did get.But, most of them have very little of bad describtion of what's going on. The book is similar to a lot of short action novels that are put together into one junk.I have to say that I put 2 stars just because it's a warhammer story. I havn't read his other books yet, but if you're looking for a good story book to read, don't try this one."
2,Worst wh40k novel I ever read,"As much as I liked the 1st and 3d book in this series, this book just isn't what it should be. It is an attempt at fleshing out the different characters under Gaunt's command by having them live through a short story of their own. Perhaps a nice idea, but the end result is a lack of plot combined with a lot of stories that just didn't seem to grasp my attention. I had to push myself through the book to finish it. The only reason it gets a second star is because it is situated in the wh40k universe."
2,"Too flashy, not good for home.","This DVD requires you to have weights, which is fine. But it also expects you to have a gym bench! (Not a step, a bench.) If there were no other way to work out with weights, I would say OK, but there are zillions of weight-lifting exercises that don't require a bench. To see them, just go to a body sculpting class at any decent gym anywhere in America. Also, the exercises are done way too fast (making injury highly likely), and there's little or no explanation of the exercises. I guess this was originally a video, because it doesn't have any DVD-style features. I bought this for somebody because it was the only weight workout I could find on DVD. It's adequate, but somebody should make a better one."
4,Good for Beginners,"I had this one years ago and repurchased it on DVD. I got bored with it fast but it is good for beginners. Kathy is a little too ""loud"" for me on this one and there are just too many people on the set."
2,My poor ears!,"Bought this because her step workout is one of the best exercise DVD's I have but this one I had to give away - her shrill, scream-y voice just made my skin crawl."
5,I love this video.,I bought this video off the shelf at my local video store not knowing what to expect. Now I love it and I use it everyday. Kathy Smith is one of the best instructors I have seen. The video is not too long or too short it is a great video to have in your fitness collection.
5,Kathy smith- timesaver-lift weights to lose weight,I am in good shape but wanted a quick workout with weights to increase metabolism. I love this video. I use it daily. Upper one day and lower body the next. I am 34 and I use the exercise bike daily too. I have noticed firmer and more toned muscles and am excited about them finally showing up. I didn't enjoy Kathy's second volume. I went back to this one immeditately.
2,Disappointed,"I have used Volume 1 for two years and have been very pleased with the weight program presented. Volume 2 is very short on exercises using weights so I feel that the video is misnamed and misrepresented. The few exercises that utilized weights are excellent, but they are very scarce."
4,Kathy does it again,"I recently began to incorporate weight training into my exercise program and I decided to go with the tried and true - Kathy Smith. Kathy helped me lose weight with her aerobic videos and I felt that she would be just as effective with the weight training. The workout is divided into two 20 minute sections for upper and lower body workouts. Kathy gets right to the point and doesn't talk you to death. I could do without all the fake smiling by the video participant's, but the workout itself is great. The workout is applicable to first timers as well as those more advanced. I highly recommend it."
3,"Keep the workout, cut the chatter!","I enjoyed the workout, but was really turned off by Kathy's excessive giggling and hopping around from person to person. She seemed easily distracted and was so offbeat at times. I enjoyed the format of separating upper and lower body, and then abs. I just prefer less chatter when I workout, which is why I choose to work out at home instead of a gym!"
5,Great workout,"I bought this and volume 1, and I love them both. It's a 40 minute full body workout or two 20 minute (upper and lower body) workouts. I like lifting and having instruction from Kathy, makes me try harder, than when I lift on my own. She keeps you moving, so it raises your heart rate too."
4,Breakneck pace,"This is an excellent results-driven video. There are 2 parts-upper body and lower body, each 20 minutes. Both are challenging, move quickly and are very thorough. You'll feel it, believe me. There is no warm-up, I do it after cardio and I think that is what was intended with this one (hence, ""Timesaver"").Kathy has a system she's incorporated into the workout which she calls the ""Dual Track System""-which means that there is instruction for both low rep & heavy weights as well as high rep & lighter weights in the same workout. She's got a class going with her (if you are familiar with KS videos, it's the usual suspects and some new faces too). The bkgd music is fast, Kathy's very whoop-y and 'motivational' (for lack of a better word) in this tape. It's high intensity, but very effective and also quite fun. You'll see results."
5,I'm very impressed and I'm getting good results!,"I like the fact that you can go heavy and that the routine can easily be split into 2 workouts. I split the exercises Day1: lower and abs, 2nd day upper and abs. Each workout is about 30 minutes. To keep the routines challenging I keep increasing the weight on both the ankle weights and dumbells. I do agree that Kathy is a little bit hyper and exhuberant but I don't mind since I find it motivating. Some change overs are a little fast, but I am going heavier and go at my own pace. I find that I can always motivate myself to do these exercises because they're only a 1/2 hour. I have been getting very good results. I have been doing this routine for 3 months."
1,"no instruction for proper form for safety, reps too fast","DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!! It is poorly presented both in instruction and video format. There are no guidelines as to form for safety or as to speed of repetitions. Everything is done too fast and in a very annoying manner - jumping from one bench to another - etc. I was so annoyed that I didn't even finish watching it. Also, three sizes of weights and a weight bench ARE required. If possible, I would give it NO stars!"
3,Fairly good with some technical problems,"I have loved Kathy Smith workout tapes/discs for years. I'm glad she did this type of a workout but I have a few issues with it: 1) The lower body section relies too heavily on squats which can lead to an imbalance in muscle development, 2) the abdominal section is not that great, 3) the stretching sections are pretty fast, 4) sometimes I wished for a better view of proper positioning or technique.Technically, there are a couple of problems with the DVD: 1) The main menu is incomplete. Hello! What's the problem here???? 2) Free stability ball workout? I don't think so. At least not on my disk and apparently not on some of the other reviewers' copies either. These kinds of mistakes are foolish in this day and age.I did think that the upper body work out was unique and challenging. I also think that it is fairly easy to scale this workout to your fitness level. She's no nonsense, not annoying, and they keep the silly production stuff to a minimum."
1,You will lose more weight walking,"I found the time-saver cardio-fat burner horrible. 1. The movements are not sharp and not clean, and they are boring. 2. The instructions are sometimes too fast and not clear 3. Neither the first 20 minutes (low Aerobic) or the last 20 minutes (high entensity Aerobic) made me feel satisfied with my work out If you want to do cardio why don't you try NAC System Interval Challenge, or Beyond 2000."
4,Good basic weighted workout,"Before I discovered Karen Voight's Great Weighted Workout, I considered this my go-to video for strength training. It's still a good basic weighted workout for days when I'm strapped for time or don't want to sweat too much."
3,Not for beginners!,"I love Kathy and usually enjoy her workouts. It should be mentioned before you buy it that a weight bench is needed to ensure proper form. Kathy is usually so good about instruction, but not this time. She doesn't talk about good form enough and for those who have never done weights before you can get injured so easly. I would not reccomend this to anyone who is inexperienced with using weights."
2,too much explaining,"I was disappointed. I normally really like Kathy Smith, but I found the abs segment to be over the top instruction-wise. Once you get the moves down, you would either have to just do them on your own, or spend a whole lot of time waiting for the next excercise. I feel the same about most of the other routines.Also, the description on the ""sleeve"" does not point out that you need varying weights and a bench or step, etc.If you are looking for a time saving spot workout, try ""I want that body"" w/ Tammilee."
3,What About Beginners?,"Two things I'd like to say but I don't want to disillusion others about workouts. One: To ME, Kathy Smith appears to beclumsy and I think it has to do with her shoes looking big. I know that sounds cruel but it's my opinion, only.Second: There doesn't seem to be any consideration for those of us who may be beginners so it doesn't rank well with me at all.Obviously she is well-known so she must be doing something right but I think she's irritating and goes too fast."
3,Great for the experienced and on-the-go individual,"I have tried other series such as the Firm and others, but like Kathy's 20 minute approach.This tape is definately for the intermediate person who knows the importance of warming up and stretching before and after. If you are familiar with other workouts and can warm up and stretch on your own, this is a great addition to your collection. It offers a quick workout and a good sweat when you have no time.I would not recommend anyone to use this as their ONLY workout tape, but great for working mom's like myself who need a quick routine to fit into your busy schedule."
3,OK video,"There are good and bad things about this video. I'll start with the bad first:1) Kathy moves from exercise to exercise way too fast 2) Kathy bounces all over the room during the exercises 3) Kathy is way too perky; shouting ""Wwwwooooooo!!"" and ""Smile!"" all the time.Now the good things: It delivers what it promises; a solid workout for the upper body and another for the lower body plus abs and back work. The workouts are short and intense, which is great for time-crunched exercisers like myself. However, I would not reccomend it for beginners."
5,Great Results!,"This was my first experience with weights. I really liked the seperate segments for upper and lower body workouts. I alternated upper and lower body workouts each day and I did increase the weights. The 20 minutes went very fast. I wouldn't say this tape is good for beginners--I found the moves a litle hard to follow at first because it moves so fast, but I stuck with it and definitely did see results. Don't miss the 7-minute ab workout, it's hard at first but worth it. The only negative I found was Kathy's annoying hoots and yahoos."
5,Kathy Smith-Lift Weights to Lose Weight,"This is a great workout for people who want to strengthen muscles and tone up. I would say it's for beginning - intermediate levels. Kathy Smith sets a great example for everyone. Also, Amazon.com is a great place to shop online!"
3,Good basic workout,"This is a good basic weight training routine for those who do not have much time to dedicate to adding weight training to their routines and for those who are afraid of bulking up. I was a little disappointed in the instruction, however, and found Kathy didn't really explain about form. It also seemed a bit repetitious even for a weight training workout."
4,Kathy Smith - Timesave- Life Weights to Lose Weight,"I enjoy this exercise tape very much, however, as in many of Kathy Smith's exercise video's, she moves rather quickly from one exercise to another which makes it difficult to keep up when you are just learning the routines and when you are changing from one weight to another.This tape does give you a good work out and I am finding that my strength is improving."
4,Different Kind of Workout,This is a really different workout from Kathy..really different from Vol 1 which I love..There are pilates emphasis on the which is great. I sweated! Wish there was more lower body but it was really a good workout. Nice change when your trying to find a week of workouts.. I plan to go between 1 and 2 for 3 days a week and Taebo for the rest to get the cardio in.
2,"WHERE IS MY ""BONUS"" STABILITY BALL WORKOUT!!!!!","I must say, I am very disappointed with this DVD - I especially wanted the ""BONUS"" 20 Minute Stability Ball Workout. I use Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight #1, which I love. I have a wonderful stability ball which I couldn't wait to use with my new $27.75 (incl taxes) DVD.I just read that one cannot return an 'opened' item. So, obviously, I'm stuck. If anyone can tell me if this DVD can be exchanged, please let me know.Good luck to all others who order it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Too annoying,"I exercised to this tape a few times and finally stopped because Kathy is just too annoying, all that shouting and screeching is just too much. If she wasn't so noisy, maybe I could have enjoyed the video more"
4,Good workout.........,"Enjoy the workout, but I would have liked a bit more on the abs routine. Finally found out how to program the DVD and the stability ball routine (tho I have not used it as yet), thanks to Elisa's, NY, review of the DVD."
3,Different,"Overall a good toning workout. Definately slower paced than LW2LW1 and it is very focused. This one has a good warm up and some stretching - both very important. Very good work on your hamstrings and buttocks. Some interesting back toning as well. She does a twist while working arms that is a little unusual and is supposed to work the core. The ab section was disappointing; I felt nothing during or after the ab workout, but it is possible that it may be too advanced for me to get any benefit. I did like the close-ups and her training instructions during the ab section. Worth trying especially if you are bored with LW2LW1"
3,"Nice, but it won't be long before your muscles adapt","The workout is nice and can become more challenging by using heavier weights, but as with any weight lifting routine, it won't be long before your muscles adapt to it and it stops being challenging. So if you're looking for variety, I would tell you to look for another video. If you already have several videos and would like to add another one to your collection, then I would recommend this one."
1,Hate it,"Not only does she annoy me with her wailing, but my entire family complains about it. And where's the music? I could deal with her noises but she is terrible at counting, (she even loses count several times)keeping tempo, her transition is so bad I've nearly hurt myself and she uses the term 'pump it' for every move, which can be confusing. This is my first and last Kathy Smith tape. I'm moving on to Tamilee."
1,Re-packaging the same old product,"I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout. The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different. Nope. I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company. One month later and I have yet to receive a response."
2,Lift Weights moves to fast,"I enjoy Kathy Smith's videos. I like the aerobic workouts and her voice doesn't annoy me, like it does some people. However, from what I have read on weight lifting, it is more effective if you do the reps slowly. This workout moved way to fast, without a lot of resting in between, if you were doing Track 1 of her system. Also, she cheats too much, running around the room, and not really doing the moves with everyone else. I think they did not show the Track 2 people enough, but the notes to the side of the screen were helpful.I disagree that you need a bench. I used a chair, and a pillow between my shoulder blades as the notes in the video recommended, and I had no problems. However, even with transition time, I felt the lifting should be done slower.After doing the workout, I am more interested in the book she wrote of the same title. I also think I will continue with using the Strong Women books and the Get on the Ball book I own for my weights workout."
3,"A Challenge, but mixed quality of production","I don't generally like weight-lifting, because I'd rather be moving around to exercise, but I try to do it two to three times a week because it's good for me, and this is the video I use. It's a decent challenge and I like the core balance additions to the lifting. I like being able to alternate between the lower and upper body sections for variety. However, there are some badly done production elements. The menu section is incomplete, not listing all the sections available in the workout. Also, the artsy camera movements in the stretch sections make me dizzy, and I skip over them. Still, the lifting is a challenge and a necessary evil!"
4,Get Over It!,"Once you get over KS whooping and hollering from one perch to the next, and you get over her not giving appropriate count downs to the reps, and you get over not having a warm up - THEN you can really enjoy a basic weight training tape that you can divide in two sections - an upperbody that I do after one of her aerobix tapes, and the lower body is very good. You have to do pushups, and really only need a five and three pound weight set (when you hold the two together - you get 8 lbs. for a heavier rep set if you want) and if you have a step bench you can use it for a weight bench. A good tape and you will feel you muscles working."
5,Overall great workout,"I am a exercise DVD junkie and this is a great addition to my library. It is a challenging workout and the perfect addition to Lift Weights Volume 1 - this time around you will hone the muscles you have built from using the first DVD. For those who say there is very little weight lifting, well, you can always pick up some dumbells during the squat segment...there you go!! The warm-up is great but the cool downs are a little weak, and like someone else said, the bonus stability ball workout is totally impossible!! But it's nice to have something you can work up to eventually. The standing upper arm routine is totally comprehensive and you will see results after a couple of workouts."
1,Kathy = Confusion,"I found this tape to be very confusing. Kathy has about twenty people doing the workout with her and she is constantly jumping around. She is also very annoying, always shouting and hooting.If you want a good wieght workout that also includes cardio try Jari Love's Get Ripped! program. Kathy's workout is also not long enough to get a really effective weight session in."
2,Annoying,I have tried and tried to use her video but her voice is so annoying that after a few minutes I have to turn it off. Would never buy a tape from her again.
2,"Effective, yet annoying","My first Kathy Smith video, and definitely my last. Although the workout was effective, especially in my arms, shoulders and butt (I could feel the effects for two days), I will be looking for another strength-training video. Kathy talked through the entire video and screamed like a hyena. Not much for warm-up or stretching, either!"
1,I Want My Money Back,"I couldn't stand her annoying voice and screams -- I didn't even think she was capable of continually doing what she was instructing. No warm up, no emphasis on technique, no smooth transitions...please...don't buy this tape! I purchased several videos for a well rounded workout targeting abs and aerobics(Denise Austin and Leslie Sansone), body sculpting (this ugly tape) and sheer fun aerobics (Richard Simmons) and by far, the best was on Denise Austin.Anyone interested in buying a useless tape?"
1,I haven't bought it yet...can someone who has answer this?,"I have read the reviews for both of her workout with weights videos. Most of the reviews said the first one was annoying...but that it worked...and the second one seems less annoying...but does the second one work as well as the first one? Will I see the same results? Someone, please let me know! Thanks a million."
3,Not the best or the worst,"I'm really not a big fan of tribute albums. I received this album for Christmas along with the GRRR! Rolling Stones compilation. Since it was a gift to me, I had to give it a listen instead of turning my nose to it. Now, this is just me, but like some tribute albums, I didn't recognize the majority of the artists on the album, but that makes it a little more interesting to listen, and possibly finding a new band to like.After listening to it, I'll admit that it isn't very strong, but it is pretty descent. I disagree with having multiple versions of one song on one album, the Ramones & Rod Stewart's covers of ""Street Fighting Man.""Overall, this is a pretty okay tribute album. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of several of the bands/musicians on it in order really enjoy it, but if you are a Rolling Stones fan, I believe you will appreciate the artists' take on the Rolling Stones classics here."
2,13 page pamplet with misnumbered pages,"I purchased the ""book"" not realizing it was just a 13-page pamplet with misnumbered pages even! You can get more info for free by Googling Chumash Indians of Southern California! Very disappointed."
1,Sold as new when really it was used,Jacket yellowed around edges and scotch taped to the inside cover (front and back) of book. Front page torn out. Had to carefully remove the tape and discard the jacket. Then had to take an exacto knife to remove the remnants from the torn out page. Sorely disappointed as this was intended as a gift.
2,Decent lessons but NO interactivity,"The lessons in this software are easy to follow and logical, but there are ZERO interactive exercises after each lesson as I had expected. You would think at least their web site would provide free downloads of practice tests or something to reinforce the learning. Instead, you must pay for them. Children learn by doing, and I have found that basic principle to be fundamentally lacking (or ignored) in this software."
4,Surprisingly good...,"...firstly, a warning. Teichiku Japan loves, absolutely LOVES reissuing the same thing 40,000 times, so it's perfectly possible that this garage comp has tons of stuff that shows up elsewhere.However, I'm going to review it for what it is, and this collection contains tons of very, very solid songs. Buy GS I Love You Too first (which gives you a feel for the genre of GS much better than volume I), and then decide whether you want to branch out, though...this stuff is expensive, and it can be hit and miss. This volume, however, is quite strong, even though quite a few of the tracks don't even APPROACH being psychedelic.As amazon doesn't provide a tracklisting, BTW, lemme run through a few of the bands: Tempters, Youngers, Mops, Golden Cups, Spiders, Mikes, Blue Comets, Tigers, Lind and Linders (obviously, there's some overlap with GS Too here)...Anyway, summary: a nice buy, and with the oft-wooly world of GS collecting, that's a rarity!"
2,They don't really increase performance and they smell bad,"I got these as a supplement to the Crowns which were unavailable at the time of order; Honestly I was doubtful that the numbing cream would work on me (novacaine dosen't work on me when I go to the dentist)so the performance wasn't extended as much as I would have liked (was hoping for porn-star stamina e.g. 30+ minutes). The feel was passable and the condoms rolled on really easily . The main issue,these stink! I mean really bad, the smell was so putrid I almost had to stop and switch, keep in mind I am not at the business end. So what I am left with is 23 not so amazing feeling connies that stink up the room, no thanks I'll stick to my trusty Durex sensitive."
3,Second rate,"This condom is different from the usual Benzocaine condoms. The Benzocaine is present as a small pellet in the tip of the condom. During intercourse, the pellet melts slowly and the benzocaine coming from it numbs only the tip of penis while the rest of the penis stays quite sensitive. In other brands, such as Trojan's Extended Pleasure, benzocaine is present in the inner lubricant and so it numbs the whole penis. The pros with Durex is that while the penis gets numbed slowly, you can feel the intercourse a lot better as compared to other condoms which numb the penis completely and make it completely sensation-less. However, I also experienced headache almost every time after using this condom, while I had been using Trojan's Extended Pleasure since a few months and never experienced anything like that with Trojan."
2,Entertaining but Not Nearly Worth it,"The DVD is 60 minutes (one hour for you retards out there) and it barely shows anything. I thought to myself before buying this, wow, uncensored sex tales with cool bands, thats gonna be awesome. It turns out that there are a bunch of bad bands no one cares about also. If you wanted to see porn, buy a porno, this is really pointless. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it had ICP in it. No one needs to spend 8 bucks on this, get it on netflix or something.here are the interviews you get to see:John Davis (KoRn)Fred Durst (Limp Bizkit)Insane Clown Posse (ICP)Nashville P*ssySugar RayMatt Zane (Society I)Wes (Limp Bizkit)Coal ChamberClint (Sevendust)El Duce (The Mentors)Lemmy (Motorhead)Tura Sanata311Tha Alkaholicsmusic video- ""The Nobodys - Addicted""like i said, its not worth it"
3,Good enough,"Buy this game if you love real-time-strategy, resource gathering and building games. It is one of the better ones available. If you do not like RTS then do not buy this game. Simple enough."
3,Age of Empires prequel,"This is a 3d-that-looks-more-like-2d prequel to Age of Empires, the game play is fun, though a bit klunky. Good tutorial, and fun if you'd like an AoE sidekick, with a similar though not very eye-popping interface."
1,Gets old,This game is awful .you might like it for the first sevral games but it gets old after awhile. Every game is about the same. After you get the later technologies you just build a thousand missle silos and nuke the enemies until they get a missle shield and nobody ever wins
2,Not a patch on Civ3,I bought this game because of the good reviews it got but i have to say i was disappointed with the overall game. At first i liked the game. it was very different to other strategy games i've played and enjoyable to play at first. the major problem i found is that every single 90 minute battle you fight against another nation is pretty much the exact same. the game becomes very boring very quickly. i can't understand how people can give this game 5 stars. there is very little variety and you can't get any long term enjoyment out of the game.
2,"good game, bad creator","The game is great! its very fun, but the version i got was not by Microsoft, but instead an exact copy by ubisoft, with faulty multi player. The multiplayer doesnt work for this version, in thrones and patriots also included in gold. I would recommend buying both versions separate, the original, and thrones and patriots (if youre feeling you would like the expansion.) For thrones and patriots, on amazon get the version by microsoft, not valuesoft. and for original rise of nations also by microsoft. I dont know why for this product it says its buy microsoft even though its a ubisof version"
1,Not the Rise of Nations version you see,"This is the trouble-prone Ubisoft version which is not the version shown by the box shot. I could not get this software to install and run on my Windows 7 PC, and I'm a Windows developer. Had to return it; your mileage may vary. Amazon should update the box shot to the Ubisoft box so customers aren't misled."
4,Decent,"This game is along the lines of Age of Empires. Go out and get resources, build up your city and army, then go stomp on the enemy. The gold edition combines the original game with the Thrones and Patriots expansion. While I enjoyed the game, I did find certain strategies that always worked against the computer controlled enemy. While it is fun for a while to beat up on the enemy, it became a little tedious after a while. Still, I think this game is worthy of purchase."
3,Good But Can be problems,"The map maker is awesome, the game play and all that is not that bad.But problems are if you have a certain generation of intel is wont work. The graphics will be muzzled.i believe it works on the newest intels but it was made for the older ones. However good game with good units.Just has that problem....."
3,Multiplayer Issues,"Don't be fooled by price like I was , this is the Ubisoft edition and has a different version than the expansion pack for online multiplayer play. If you order this you WILL NOT be able to play online with other players.You can get online and see the games and players in the lobby but not be able to connect to any games.You can create a game and play against comps online but you can do that in solo player mode anyway , the only advantage to doing this is you can't use cheat codes , or pause game while building or moving troops etc. online like you can in solo games.The game I received is not the one pictured and was made in FRANCE.I have spent hours trying to patch this turkey and still haven't been able to do it as it involves downloading MagicDisc,using Nero and fiddleing around with the files on the game disc to get it to work online.Shame on Amazon for selling this foreign piece of junk."
4,Great game some frustration,"I bought the original RON game without the expansion and loved it. I have been thinking about getting the expansion since the original was so much fun. The expansion is great but there are a few things that I dont like. When you go into some of the preset conquer the world scenarios, like being France for instance, it shows that you can attack several different countries when in fact, it forces you to attack the ones it wants you to attack. One of things that makes the game excellent and continually fun is the fact that the replayabilit of the game is one of the best I have seen. You cant do that with some of the prearranged scenarios.Overall, I give the game the following:game play: 5 starsgraphics: 4.5 starsscenarios: 4 starssounds/music: 4.5 starsoverall: 4.5 starsGreat game. Fun for all."
5,Sweet game. Great developer.,I don't much care for managing all that you manage but still a great RTS. Little shallower than Civilization and I like that. But Still a great game. One copy on both of my PCs and we can LAN play so that was a bonus!
2,No Americans in the version we received,"We did receive the product as pictured, but didn't realize that it was a European version of Rise of Nations. Be aware that this product will not contain American military like the original Rise of Nations Gold did. My son still intends to play this but was disappointed."
1,Some Parts Do Not Function Properly,Some scripts do not work. The script that shows the player's progress versus the computer does not appear. Many other scripts (e.g. the lumber mill and the number of citizens employed and all other similar resources) is either not displayed or not fully displayed. This makes it difficult to compete agains the computer. I do not know if this is caused by incompatibility with Windows 7 but it detracts from the gameplay and purchasers should be forewarned.
5,Awesome!,"How awesome is this game? Have you ever seen a monkey riding a bull? Because this is better than that. For a ten year old game, this beats out all my new games by far, I STILL play this, thats how good it is. I love this game, and for this price, it cannot be beat. If you like strategy games, get this."
4,"Beware, Vista users!","The game as such is awesome, but if you decide to buy it, you might experience compatibility issues with Windows Vista. No need to panic: the problem is easily solved by downloading a fix file... but in the end I had to spend quite some time dealing with the problem before I could actually start having fun."
1,Not well made,"I was very disappointed in this product for the following reasons:1. The zipper jumped off track. I was able to get it back on by unzipping & rezipping a few times. However, it looks like it will be problematic in the future.2. Extremely strong smell3. Fibers from the inside lining clung to every item I placed in the bag. This was the worst problem. I would have sent it back but weighing the cost & the aggravation factor I decided to see if I could fix it. At first I took a damp sponge & wiped the inside out over & over but there was no end to the small black fibers clinging to the sponge. Then I went all out intending to fix it or destroy it. I filled it with water & scrubbed it with the rough side of the sponge. The outer layer of the lining, which was sort of felt-like, came off almost like paper. It took about 45 minutes of trying to get it all out. It's now drying by the fireplace & I will attempt to use it tommorrow.I definitely would not buy this again."
3,"looks nice, but needs time to air out","to look and feel of this bag is decent, but the dye smells pretty strong and took several days to air out. The size is decent for a few items, but I""m not sure what the little pockets in front are good for -- too long for a modern cell phone; maybe a pen? Anyway, I have a Swiss Gear bag that I use for my ""man purse"" that has more pockets in appropriate sizes. Still, this might come in handy when I want something a little less casual."
3,Empty Pockets,"At 50, I decided I'm ""man enough"" to use a travel bag for my things rather than fill my pockets with wallet, change, cell phone, pens, security badge, etc. I saw the satisfied customer reviews on this items and was delighted to receive it for a Father's Day gift. It fits my needs exactly - not too large, not too small - has a hand grasp and also a shoulder strap. The bonus - it looks more like an Indiana Jones adventure bag than a ladies purse. It's great to not have to dump out pockets at the end of the day, and fill them up again in the morning.12/23/12 follow-up.Ladies - perhaps you know how long a bag should last, but after 6 months of daily use, this one is just about worn out. Small holes are appearing, the leather is cracking, and one hasp holding the shoulder strap is broken. Going to downgrade my rating from 5 stars to 3 starts."
3,Man's bag,"Everything about the item was exactly as stated but BEWARE as other reviews noted that there is a very strong odor that stays with the item and is very objectionable I have tried everything from putting in dryer with dyer sheets, to spraying inside with Frebreeze and hanging outside and still extremely objectionable. Fits my needs so will keep."
2,Would keep it if it wasn't for the smell,size/description is good and accurate. I think it would have worked for my father but I can't get over the horrible chemical smell. Smelled it as soon as opened the package and it's been in my office all day and now the smell is throughout the office as well. Returning it today.
4,Nice little bag,"This bag is nice and the price is right. It is on the small side though. I bought this item to drop in my netbook messenger bag. This way, I have all my personal stuff with me all the time. If I don't need my netbook, I can just take the bag.The reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I was hopping for some small pockets within the bag. The problem I have, everything falls to the bottom of the bag, making it not so organized. And since things fall to the bottom of the main pockets, it creates a bulge in my netbook bag. Would have been nice to include some smaller sewed on pockets inside the main compartments to keep the bag less bulgy."
4,Great bag,"This was a gift for my husband. He has so much that he carries and always wanted to put it in my already stuffed purse. Now, he can carry all he needs without packing my purse full or his pockets!"
2,Don't like this bag,The bag smells of some chemical odour. Zippers are also look like not so reliable. On the surface it can be seen the traces from a dye.
1,The eyeglass and phone pockets will not snap close. Items inside these pockets can fall out.,The eyeglass and phone pockets will not snap close. Items inside these pockets can fall out. I would not recommend this product to others. COmpany needs to enure that all compartments of the the product works before shipping the product out to customers.
4,379ed,I took this bag with me to Spain and found it extremely useful. It held lots ofitems and never weighed too heavily. Really a very nice product. The color-brown.
4,It was ok for the price.,"As several reviewers stated, it really does a have strong smell to it. But since it's for my dad, I figured I won't have to deal with the smell & he probably won't even notice it. It smells like a pair of cowboy boots, which he owns. I thought the bag was going to be a bit bigger than what it actually is, but again...it's for my dad, who's a pretty manly guy & probably wouldn't carry it around if it were any bigger."
3,It's organized very well & looks good but...,The product is not as good as I expected because the color of the leather it is made of is uneven: in different places (especially on sides) it varies from dark to lighter brown though it doesn't catch the eye immediately. It is quite visible only if you carefully examine the thing. Besides there are scratches inside on lining as if it has been kept in the same place and position for years. Generally the bag looks all right but the quality is far from excellent.
5,Wow! What a book!,"If you haven't read this thrilling story about the true meaning of family, well, race right out and get it. Wow, what a fantastic story. I'm not a big reader of Canadian fiction but a friend turned me on to ""The Long Run"" and I couldn't put it down. It's laugh-out loud funny with an undercurrent of deep pathos.If you're looking for page turner of a read, this is for you."
2,too long for the story it had to tell,I came to this book through a friend who loved it so much she was rereading it. My expectations were too high. It needed considerable editing. Someone to ask the author some hard questions. Things didn't hold together and it was too long. As a first book all I can say is that the author has better works ahead of him if he finds a good editor who can help him. Good luck to him.
4,A novel for every man,"Having been born and raised an Irish Catholic on the east coast of the United States surprisingly had little to do with the strong connection I immediately felt with the characters in The Long Run. The school boys and Roman Catholic Brothers in this novel are truly for every man. The fact that the author is a Newfoundlander should surprise no one who is familiar with their Celtic sensibilities. Leo Furey has an outstanding ability to instantly attach you to his characters by describing them in very concise yet eloquent prose. The love and understanding he has for them are instantly conveyed to the reader in a way unlike most contemporary writers with whom I am familiar. Even if I had never been scolded by a ""well-meaning"" nun nor strapped by a ""dutiful"" priest, the boys and Brothers of Mount Cashel would be dear to my heart for good or for bad. This first novel has every sign of being truly from the heart. A heart that lies within all of us."
2,Athens revisted,"I used to live in Athens around this time and it was interesting to see the footage again, the Pylon shoots are really cool. The BBQ Killers also steal the show, thanks to the infamous Laura Carter. REM fans will enjoy the footage of the band shot in the Lucy Cobb chapel performing acoustic songs. I don't know if someone who hasn't spend time in Athens would appreciate the movie as much as former residents. As some other reviewers have noted, the 5.1 audio is unplayable, it comes out super distorted. The extras are pretty amateurish and some of the menu items don't work correctly. I would say this is worth renting or borrowing but not buying unless they can fix these glitches. The original movie would rate 4 stars, but the DVD version is only 2."
4,Athens music scene in the 80's,"Great video, if you're into alternative music. Paints an overview of Athens in the late 70's/early 80's. Features the B52's and REM as well as many lesser known or unknown bands. The significance of this music is paramount as it influenced alternative music throughout the entire country. What makes Athens bands particularly unique is their ability to co-exist without destructive competition."
2,Don't waste your money,Try to find clips from youtube instead of purchasing this. The footage of the Flat Duo Jets is the best part but was confused about them being in this as they are not native to GA. Very little about the B52's.
4,"Charming soundtrack, moody and pensive both","I direct local theater and have used pieces from this soundtrack as background music for my plays. I believe Marvin Hamlish composed the music, whihc is touching and somber at times. Recommended"
1,If you're looking for the Flying Spaghetti Monster...,This is not the book you're looking for. Different Bobby Henderson.
1,Not the Flying Spaghetti Monster (I don't think),This sounds like it's probably an actual Christian religious book.You probably don't want to buy this book if you're looking for something by the Bobby Henderson that authored The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
4,Cute!,"My 2 1/2 yr. old loves playing with both baby dolls & My Little Ponies, so this was the perfect combination. My only complaint is the ""baby"" carrier will fall off your child. The pony is too heavy for the weak hold of the velcro."
4,This pony is really cute.,"This pony is really cute. I love my pony very much. Although I wish she did more, I was better off with the celebration castle."
3,Disappointed!!!!,"My 4 yr old and 2 yr old girls wanted this when they saw it on tv for x-mas, they receive it earlly and it was a disappointment, my 2 year old like the little my little ponys better and didn't even pay attention to the soft baby one, my 4 year like it and play with it for about 20 minute, you are suppost to beable to wear the carrier on your neck but it doesn't work at all, if falls right off. My 4 yr old was very disappointed that she couldn't carry it around like a baby. I don't think it's a good item at all, it's not all that it's talk about on tv..."
5,My Little Pony's Rule!,"I bought this toy for my Goddaughter's b-day. She is IN LOVE with her new ""baby"". At 4 years old she is excited at the prospect of caring for, and toting around her Pony. The Pony is adorable and makes the cutest sounds. My best friend told me she is going to kill me b/c my goddaughter doesn't want to go anywhere without her My Little Pony. LOL Any little girl would love this toy."
4,Deeper than the title suggests,"This is the first book by Dr. Orloff that I've read, and I really liked it. She provides information in such a way that someone new to the subject matter (chakras, meditation, spirit energy, etc.) can understand it, but someone more familiar can enjoy a refresher course and possibly glean a few things they didn't know.I think this would be a excellent companion book to those on the Highly Sensitive Person, which is really the same as an empath, but sounds less woo-woo for the anti-New Age set :)"
5,loved it!,"I have been told that I ""emo"" before ""emo"" was cool...Not that being ""emo"" is cool. With this book I realized why I always felt that way. It also gave me a new view on religion. Coming from a family where my god father was the pastor of our church and some of the things in the bible seemed very hypocritical this book really helped."
5,Thanks for the boost,"Some of us get so far in life, and then we stop. We don't know why or how to get going again. We spend too much time trying to recuperate or get back on track. ""Positive Energy"" is about getting back on track. When you've reached a plateau, often you need a boost to reach the next level. And sometimes that boost is a new perspective. Judith (forgive the informality, but I feel like friends) brings to light an understanding of the 'inside' us, and how to relate to the 'outside' world. Some of us are too sensitive, but (now I know) in a good way. Once you realize that being sensitive is a good thing, you begin to look at the world like your oyster and your newly discovered trait as the pearl. Thanks again Judith."
5,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN THE FIELD !,"The book ""positive energy"" is refered to as a ""make you feel beter"" book... but after reading it, it is obvious the knowledge is so thorough and to the point that you can realy call it an advance book on the subject of energy healing.It is obvious that dr. judd speaks from experience, this is why the practical aspect can realy be taken to practice.I read many books on the subject, this is realy an exeption as it talks about the small very important neuances... I think it is worth much more than its prise.Very easy to read, gracefull and rich in content, this book is a treasure.Dr. judd allso turned out to be very friendly and caring, she e_mailed me back regarging a question I've had...What more can I say ? a great book..."
5,An excellent book,This is simply a wonderful book. I am a personal trainer and lifestyle coach based in the UK and Judith Orloff's Positive Energy is exactly the kind of book that I want all my clients to read.Her approach is wonderfully nurturing and the content touches on all the areas in life that will make a difference. From food to sex to laughter - certainly my idea of a good time!The inclination of the book is toward a practical application of what works for you. By following even some of Judith's excellent guidance you will nurture creativity and happiness in your life.This book has jumped right to the top of my top ten. it speaks to me every time I open the pages.
3,Great Expectations,"I had great expectations for this book as her previous work really touched my heart, but as I began eagerly reading (having pre-ordered it in anticipation), I kept waiting for it to grab me, to feel that ""ahah!"" moment. It never happened. Yes, there's alot of wonderful ideas here--butnothing really new, nothing that would make me want toread it again and again, as I did her last book. Perhaps I'm notas receptive--I may try again at another time--but for now, I'm still searching..."
3,ok advice if you can get past the fluff,"shorn of the california celebrity name dropping and in language, this actually has some ok advice for dealing with energy vampires which is what I wanted it for, but the fluff to nugget ratio may be too high for most to stomach."
1,Not inspirational nor effective,"Really a waste of time and money. It has no real content that can change your energy in a permanent way, It only gives you temporary remedies. I was looking for something that would create the right mindset to generate energy on your own without any silly physical exercise.I recommend Energy Boss better. That book teaches you to command energy and how energy works.Energy Boss"
3,"Interesting, but fluffy","I come from a financial/business background, so my typical frame of reference is a business book. While I enjoyed the positive message of Dr. Orloff's book, let's be clear that it is not written in a concise, highly-practical way. This 384 page book could probably be boiled down to 50-80 pages easily. She had exercises at the end of each chapter, which I appreciated, although I was honestly a little let down by the flimsiness of these exercises. As someone not already ""sold"" on her ideas about subtle energy, intuitive empaths, etc. her work fell a bit flat upon trying to integrate her views/practices into reality. A decent book overall, and certainly some worthwhile ideas on how to manage your energy, but this shouldn't be the ""only"" book you read on any of the topics it covers."
1,Hokey,"I got the oral version of this and could stand it only about 10 minutes before losing interest. The whole idea of feeling the aura around a partner was a little goofy for me. I was genuinely interested in techniques of self help, but this was reminiscent of suggestions that were passed around Haight Asbury in the late-60s."
5,Book in Awesome Condition,I have heard so many good things about this author and can't wait to read this book. Received very quickly and in great shape.
5,A Real Mind-Opener,"I came away from each of the ten prescriptions of this very readable and engaging book with inspiring and motivating insights, even in those few which read a bit slow for me, but I was particularly energized by ""The Sixth Prescription: Open Yourself to the Flow of Inspiration and Creativity."" The book could be very useful for small groups sharing the energy and insight generated in the practical exercises throughout. Very worthwhile and transformative."
4,Very Good Info,"Very good information. Definitely worth buying, gives some insight into how to develop better habits and become more aware of your inner workings."
5,Renew your vitality!,This book is a must read for health care providers as well as patients. It will radically change your practice. I was already moving in this direction as a nurse practitioner and a human being and Dr. Orloff's brilliant work defined and described that which I was discovering. It has also began to open up a whole new world in which I'd never conceived! It is well worth the money and time investment for what you will receive! Join with me in living life to the fullest! Blessings!
1,Disappointed,"Terrible video, felt like I went back in time 30 years! Not what I was expecting, at all! I won't use it again, so it was a complete waste of my money!"
1,Not Good If you Own a Spinning Bike!,"I was mislead to believe this DVD was for spinning bike owners! It is not! If you own a spinning bike with a resistance knob, it is no good for you!"
1,outdated,"This may have been a good workout video 15 years ago, I found it very outdated. They are not using spin bikes, they are using bicycles on trainers. Almost completely useless to me."
2,The guy is a sweeb,I just didn't like the instructor. Thought he was kind of annoying and not motivating at all.
5,"If you liked Memoirs of a Geisha, you'll love this!","The Mask Carver's Son was a wonderful discovery for me. The author's voice sings with both the passion and the pain of an artist caught between two worlds. Richman connects the seemingly diametric cultures of Europe and Asia with seamless, exquisite prose. Not only does this novel weave historical information of an artist in turn-of the century Japan and France, it depicts a highly moving story of a difficult father and his conflicted son."
4,Like it - Be Careful of Cool Down,I like the Kathy Smith Step Workout. It has stages for beginners to advance step exercises. You can work your way up. I did have an issue with the some of the cool down exercises. For my part I will have to modify the cool down exercises to fit what I am physically able to accomplish. I have used this video twice since I purchased it and plan to use it again. I really enjoy step exercises and I am 58 years old.
5,Step Workout,"I really like this workout. It's organized very well and it's easy to adjust to either your available time or your fitness level. With the 3 sections; beginning, intermediate and advanced, it's easy to get what you want. There is also a good toning section using weights and a mat. My ONLY problem with this is that when I ordered it, I ended up ordering duplicates because they show the SAME WORKOUT with 2 DIFFERENT fronts! very deceptive."
4,EASY TO FOLLOW,"A good, basic workout. Not too hard, not too easy. Very easy to follow, uncomplicated."
3,"Good deal for the price, but a bit out dated.","This DVD is a bit outdated, for some reason I read 2002 and not 1992 when I purchased it. It is a good workout and offers the ability to skip to various sections which include a warm-up, beginner, intermediate, advanced, toning, weights and abs section. Some of the moves are outdated, and some of them offer the potential to pull something more so than modern step moves. The first time I did this video I pulled my back, so I would suggest you to go slow and modify exercises that are uncomfortable with moves you are more familiar with. Overall I will continue to use this video for my step workouts, but I would not purchase again because this is so outdated."
2,Hated it,"I've done several step videos and enjoyed most of them very much. This one, however, was very difficult to follow and not any fun at all. I would not recommend it to anyone. My favorite step instructor is Gin Miller and her style is very different from Ms. Smith. Much more fun and much easier to follow. Kathy Smith seems to be all about promoting herself and not about helping people achieve better fitness."
2,. . . snore . . .,"While you might get a good workout doing this video, it'll only work if you can stick with it and finish it without being bored to tears. It's simple and repetitive, and I couldn't stick with it for more than a few days. Plus, the eighty's aerobic thongs are kind of a turn-off..."
1,This is not a work out!,"I purchased 2 of Kathy Smith's videos and they are now going to GoodWill. I cannot follow her work-outs. This girl is all over the map and the camera man is more interested in showing us her chest than what her arms and legs are doing. Also, the routines themselves are difficult to follow and extremely jerky. I have other work out videas that are smooth and easy to follow. I do not recommend Kathy Smith unless you feel the need to lose your balance and break an ankle."
4,Basic But Effective,"I own this video on VHS, but I'm putting it on my Wish List to have it on DVD. The workout itself is 69 minutes total, and it provides a decent cardio workout as well as some strength training. Most of the routine is very basic, but I found it to be effective. Kathy's cueing is great, and I like how she even turns the class over to some of her castmates to lead. While the video is over 14 years old and the clothes are a bit dated, it's still holds up great. A good workout for beginner to intermediate steppers."
2,Yawn!,"I bought this video sight unseen thinking that just because the instructor has put out other fun videos, this one was guaranteed to be great too. Kathy Smith's 'Aerobox Workout' is one of my favorite all time videos. Alas, I was wrong.This has got to be one of the most repetitive, boring step workouts I've ever done. The only person I'd recommend this workout for is an absolute beginner. I hate videos where I end up watching the clock the whole time - this is one of them. The music is uninspiring and the moves are totally plain Jane. Spend your money on something else unless you're just starting out in step!"
2,Not the best,I did not love this workout. I have done step before and even the advanced portion was boring and simple. I enjoy a workout where I can break a sweat and I end up skipping this one on my DVD shelf more often than not.If you are just starting out with step it's probably a good option; if you have done step before you will probably find this too easy.
2,Targeted toward beginners,"This would be a great video for a beginner stepper; otherwise, it's pretty boring. It's very repetitive - I found myself counting down the minutes until the end of each section. Ultimately, it did get my heart rate up and I got a pretty good workout. I just didn't enjoy the process at all."
1,not so advanced,"I thought this product was an advanced step arobics workout.... it's not at all!!!This DVD is more for beggining steppers, if you are advanced this video will barely get your heart rate up. And its very repetative so it can get very boring!"
5,step dvd,I love the dvd and it is a really good workout. It is everything that I expected from the description. You can do just part of it or all of it.
2,Not for me.,I rated this video as a 2 because I feel it's boring and annoying. Kathy doesn't step to the beat of the music and she seems to be overly trying to enjoy herself. I've tried this tape 3 times and have decided that it's not worth doing because I get too annoyed.
5,As affective as 10 years ago!,I had burned through two copies of this on VHS and decided it was time to purchase a DVD since VHS may soon be extinct. Kathy Smith is not a familiar instructor as others and doesn't get the credit I feel she deserves in the fitness industry. This is a great workout just as it was for me 10 years ago. Seller shipped exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion and is one to shop with in the future for similar purchases. Pleasure shopping with you.
4,Had this DVD for 3 years and it's still challenging!,"Yes it's a old and you might giggle at the leotards at first but this is definatley one of my favourite DVDS. There isn't alot of jumping or high intensity movements(non explosive), which means the routines are longer and i think it focases more on getting your stamina and fitness up. When i bought this DVD i used 2 step levels(adjustable step heights), then after having a baby and dropped it down to one level and built up back to using 2 steps. There is a big difference doing this routine on different Step platform levels so it's good for all fitness levels. Yes it can get a bit boring but it's worth it, definatley helped me alot. I use it once a week."
4,Kathy Smith Step Workout,"I like the routine, but as others have mentioned the stepping and the counting is off for some routines. The workout provides a good intensity level for me. I haven't done a step workout for years and this is exactly what I was looking for. I also enjoy the body conditioning for a complete workout."
3,Hard To Follow For a Beginner,"Although I do believe that this video would be great for an advanced person, I had a hard time following the instructions. I have never attempted step aerobics and this is not the way I wanted to begin. I had to make up my own steps because the video was too confusing and hard to follow. Maybe I am too uncoordinated, but I wanted a video that would be easier for a beginner to follow."
5,EXCELLENT STEP WORKOUT TAPE,This is a great workout. It's easy to follow and it works. Do it regularly and you'll sweat off the pounds. I've been doing it for a couple of years and will continue to use it for many more years. Even my teenager uses this workout!
4,Good intermediate step workout,"I am not well co-ordinated and prefer simple routines to follow. I was worried that this might be too easy because I own other Kathy Smith DVD's and find them boring and easy. I hadn't done step in about ten years until about a month ago. I do all three segments and get a really good cardio workout. I didn't like the ab or upper body segments at all. If you prefer more complicated moves or are an advanced stepper, this is not for you. I haven't found any exercise videos/DVDs that have good music and as far as instructors go, Kathy Smith is easy to follow and probably one of the least annoying. It's a good intermediate step workout."
5,Completely Satisfied!!,"I was completely satisfied with the quality of the product, the cost, the shipping time, the packaging,etc. - will definitely order from Amazon again!!!"
3,For true beginners only,"I didn't care for this workout. I would suggest it only if you have never done step at all before. I found it repetitive and boring. I could not keep myself interested enough to get into it. I think it would be a great introduction of step to someone who has never done it, though,"
2,About the workout,Nothing wrong with the seller...but the workout is not what I expected. Not enough variety. Some of the steps are too repetitive. I have seen and done step workouts that had enough variety to be fun enough to do over and over....too bad the ones I am thinking about are not on DVD.
4,"Good workout, cuing could be better","I am new to step aerobics and wanted to try an old standby, so I bought this one. And, come on, for $5, this is not a bad deal. As others have described, the DVD is broken into sections. As an intermediate-level exerciser, I could get through the whole thing. The only big complaint, is the ""fancy footwork"" without adequate cuing. No doubt, by the tenth time, I'll have gotten it, but a bit disappointing. You will sweat and a true beginner may be challenged to do more than the first segment. So what? Keep up until you can do more."
5,The best step video for beginners-intermediate,"If you are just starting out stepping, I would highly recommend this as starting point.This is one of Kathy Smith's best efforts. The workout is well designed with a warm-up, 3 progressive levels of intensity, cool down and quick toning sections. Depending on your level of fitness you can do one or all three stepping sections.The choreography is very easy to learn and Kathy does an excellent job breaking down the steps and cuing."
2,No way this is for beginners,"I have been working out for over 6 months and decided to change it up by adding a step. I ordered this DVD because I liked other Kathy Smith videos that I own. I couldn't even keep up with the Beginner segment! She goes much too fast, and changes the moves way too often, without enough advanced instruction. She either changed or added a move every few seconds, before you could figure out what she was doing. I don't believe that a real beginner to working out, which I'm not, could keep up with this."
4,Dated but Effective,"This step workout has been an enjoyable and effective step aerobic workout. The video is dated, probably from the 90's, but that can add some amusement to the workout at times."
5,rare but true,"Very rarely does one come across an album that you like from start to finish, but this is one of those rarities. That you might not speak or even understand Polish is not, nor should not be an issue.Budka possess an almost unique ability to draw you into their music, Krzysztof Cugowski vocals are brilliant, his voice can make the hairs on your neck stand up, and instrumently the album is superbly finished. From the ballads to rock there may be no finer album."
4,A fine story about a family on the run,"Clancy has his military hardware, Grisham has his law offices, and Gilstrap is a fine author who, at least thus far, specializes in weaving skilful tales about innocents on the run.John Gilstrap's first novel, Nathan's Run, follows the trail of a 12-year-old, wanted for murder, who is on a desperate flight from law enforcement and a determined hit-man.The second, At All Costs, is another page-turner about The Donovans, a couple that takes flight with their young son after they are accused of slaughtering sixteen of their friends and initiating the country's worst-ever environmental disaster.After fourteen years on the run, a false arrest puts the Donovans in a plight that will either destroy them, or prove their innocence.Gilstrap is not a particularly fine stylist, but he does excel in structuring original, exciting stories that entertain and surprise. The net effect is very similar to a John Grisham story, and that's not bad company."
4,you'll read this page turner well into the night,a well written action novel with a human touch. Very enjoyable read and the twists just keep on coming.
1,Would you believe?,"At All Costsbegins with a conceivable and interesting scenario: a sniper's attack at the site of a weapons dump cleanup operation. The initial action is quite gripping. However, as one reads, the implausible and impossible decisions and events just keep piling up. By 51%, I no longer cared what the author did with the plot or the characters.If you can stay completely engrossed in the flow and avoid all rational analysis, you might enjoy this book. My advice would be to skip it."
3,Entertaining but predictable,"It is a good book to read in your spear time. It follows the all-well-known basic lines for a goverment plot. Nothing new, nothing to discover. Some people will think is too simple, others will find it excellent.Is funny though, how the big conspiration always comes down to the last personal showdown head-to-head. I personally had a good time and got entertained for a couple of days.If you like it, you should read ""The eleventh commamdment"" by Jeffrey Archer, and/or ""The General's Daughter"" by Nelson DeMille."
2,.,"I read this book after reading the numerous good reviews this book received. But, I believe some of the negative reviews more accurately represent the numerous problems this book has. The author does an excellent job making this book a quick, mindless read, but the author sacrifices realism to keep the plot moving at a frenetic pace. There are several points in the book where I just scratched my head and thought that there is no way the character would act that way. In fact, the reason the good guys are on the run is far-fetched and laughable and could have easily been prevented by the good guys talking to the police right after the incident happened instead of finding excuse after implausible excuse to do the wrong thing. I am now in the middle of a far superior novel called ""The Trial"" by Clifford Irving, which is a true example of fine, fast paced writing."
3,A Get Up and Go Kind of Book,"Overall this is just a fun book, it moves fast and is easy to read. The characters are Mr. and Mrs. everybody thus you identify with them easily. The story is fun if not a little on the ""yea right"" side of the bench. Ok so some of the actions the lead characters pull off are really not in keeping with a clean cut pair of middle Americans, but hey it's a fiction book. The plot is a little light, there really is not much going on except the main story line and the writing could give us more depth and details, bur becuase it was exciting I let it pass. It reminds me of the movie ""Airplane"", everyone enjoys watching it but it is not going to be on the AFI top 100 movies list anytime soon. Go into this book not expecting a lot and you will enjoy it."
2,"tedious, predictable, two-dimensional","This book was a big disappointment, especially given the reviews it has had on-line here. The writing is stilted, the characterizations are flat and predictable, and the big ""who's behind it all?"" surprise is telegraphed three hundred pages in advance. It's billed as a thriller, but there were no thrills in it for me..."
4,Excellent! Scary! Suspense Filled! Heart Pounding!,What a good scary book! If you want to read a can't put it down story.......read this one!
5,John Gilstrap has exceeded even my expectations,"I read the Kirkus review of this book and wonder if they really enjoy any books. This book was well written, maybe the plot was similar to Nathan's Run but most authors who write suspense books tend to stick to similar ideas but that does not make them bad. I thoroughly enjoyed this entire book and even though some of it was a stretch (miss the bad guys by a hair) well, thats what entertainment is all about. I caught myself holding my breath waiting for the white caddie to appear. Will read anything this author puts out unless he really screws up downstream and becomes a word factory like some others. Would rather wait for a really good book than get more that are just cranked out."
5,I hated to put it down!,"After reading Nathen's Run, I was anxious to see if this was as good or better. Pleased to say that it surpasses Nathen's Run. The plot is intriguing because it doesn't tell you the whole story up front. You haven't a clue as to what happened to set up the scenerio presented. Ending unexpected. Congratulations to the author."
5,At All Costs,"If you like a book with terrorism , lies and sneaky getaways, this is the book for you. In the book a couple is blamed for blowing up a weapon bunker that they were inspecting for certain materials. They are forced to run and hide in multiple places over a span of fourteen years. If you want to know what happens to this couple, then read the book."
5,PRAISE AND WORSHIP AT ITS BEST,"I have every gospel CD available, let me tell you this one is high up there. Every song on this CD is wonderful. I love how I can sing along with every song.Go get it quick"
3,Unveiling Experience,"I think this project was an awesome experience in entering the ""Throne Room"". However, I was kind of expecting something a little more contemporary and up-beat from this soundtrack. It definetly was geared more toward worship and praise. A nice CDto listen to if you to want relax and unwind after a hectic day at work. CeCe, continue to be the praise and worshipper that you are, seek God in all your endeavors and continue to allow God to take you to another level and dimension in him"
5,I love her voice,"Cece is the best female Christian artist. Her voice is smooth and soothing. Through the course of her CDs, she has shown she can sing all types of music (well at least all types that can be closely associated with black gospel music). I feel she has better style and vocal execution than any Christian artist in the genre today.All that said -THIS CD IS BORING!!!!! SO. VERY. BORING. !. !. !.ugh! Its boring!Musically, it sounds great. She sounds wonderfully awesome. But. Its very boring. Also, some of he songs sound like she is making them up on the spot.All THAT said - I LOVE MERCY SAID NO and HALELUJAH PRAISE and THIRST FOR YOU. Those songs are AWESOME! woo-hoo! I love you Cece!"
2,The Most Dissappointing,"There are some CDs you buy just by the artist's name knowing you will get what you expected and so much more. This is definitely not the case with this release by CeCe. I must confess the name of the CD caught me. Having all of CeCe's other albums I though this would be one that would transport me into that special place. Instead it not only left me firmly on the ground but searching for some understanding as to what happened. Personally, I think CeCe should let her brothers write for her. Or maybe some more traditional Gospel artist and stop experimenting with these strange writers/producers whose style does not match her being. You cannot feel CeCe in this album. It feels like she is ministering to a Japanese group and struggling to communicate all the while being worn out in the effort. I absolutely love CeCe's music normally just this one left me dumb founded and thunder struck. Lost to be exact."
5,CeCe has done it again!,"On this CD, CeCe has done what she does best: leads you into the presence of God...to the ""Throne Room"" if you will. This collection of songs is light and perfect for using for devotional time. The entire CD is filled with slow- to mid-tempo songs that you could literally listen to ALL day long! It is nearly impossible to pick ""stand-out"" tracks because they ALL stand out! If you have any CeCe Winans' CD's in your personal collection, make room, because you MUST add this one! You will NOT be disappointed."
4,Throne Room Praise!,"This is CeCe at her best and at her most personal. It is high praise and worship at its peak. I had the blessed opportunity to praise God with CeCe at a local church a week before Throne Room was released. The congregation was caught in the Spirit and left that place with bellies full of praise! This is an awesome praise and worship CD. It leans more toward the traditional side, but is a true blessing for lovers of contemporary gospel as well. It hits you dead center. Listen for yourselves and be blessed!"
1,Godawful,"Imagine the vocal stylings of Dinosaur Jr. and Ween mixed in a blender, only weaker and with no conviction. Now imagine run-of-the-mill musicianship recorded in someone's bedroom with cheap mics and a shipping blanket for an isolation booth. A bunch of songs with a timid intros, slacker synth parts, meandering verses and lyrics, a so-so hook for the chorus, one or two interesting chord changes along the way, and you've got Gingersol.These songs might not be half-bad if executed competently. I tried several times to listen to the thing all the way through and never made it."
1,P-O-S: could have been but wasn't.,"This unit is to be avoided. It is poorly engineered and poorly constructed. (I am a commercial machine maintenance tech) Before I even plugged it in it broke two of it's caster wheels, 2 weeks later the float switch stuck on the water pump causing a tremendously awful noise in middle of night. 3 weeks after this the electronic control pad stopped working, had to bypass entire control with a timer assembly to get it to work. A few weeks after this the condenser squirrel cage fan broke at the connection hub, after removing and repairing condenser fan, when I went to reassemble it a poorly soldered pipe leading into the evaporator pulled free, expelling all the refrigerant and thus ending it's usage completely. This unit had possibilities but simply was built too cheaply."
5,Talk Dirty To Me,"The elegant Catherine (Fanny Ardant) discovers her husband, Gerard Depardieu is doing what men do...having a ""banal"" affair. When Catherine asks her husband for details, her husband can't or won't provide them. Catherine hires a prostitute, the gorgeous Emmanuelle Beart, to seduce her husband and reveal her husband's erotic proclivities. Nathalie's ensuing tales of lust and passion propagate an understated sexual tension between her and Catherine that will make any viewer weak in the knees.A surprisingly good movie. I didn't think there could be a more unlikely romance, but by the end of this film I was begging for Catherine and Nathalie to ""just kiss already"". What can I say? I'm a hopeless romantic. The erotic talk, the slow seduction, two gorgeous and intelligent women, scotch and cigarettes, broken hearts and understated lust, Paris, feminine vulnerability and strength...probably the most sexy movie I've seen. Recommended."
1,nothing special,"Buy it only if you are a big fun of Emmanuelle Beart. Her acting is great, but there is nothing else."
3,Wafty,"This film never really got going for me, it is very stylised although not atmospheric and there is a lot of pretentious dialogue which doesn't serve much other than perhaps tittilate the (female?) viewer. There is a bit of a twist at the end which redeemed it in a way but by then I was so over the corny sex dialogue between Beart and Ardant that I barely cared. This film really is nothing special and I would only recommend it to fans of Emmanuelle Beart as she certainly features."
2,Not for Serious Language Students,"This dictionary is primarily for tourists. It was not designed for language study. If you're trying to converse or translate, it is a poor tool. Although it attempts to use latin script, some letters are substituted which makes deciphering a bit slow until you get used to it. If you find yourself in Baku you might be able to survive with this dictionary in your pocket."
1,"Look deeper into the Azrei ""language"" and ""history"" (!?)","Look deeper into the Azrei ""language"" and ""history"" (!?).... This dictionary is not compiled based on the latest achievements in world lexicology and lexicography."
2,the very basics,"I don't like the choice of transcriptions for some of the Azerbaijani characters. But that aside, if you're going to travel to Azerbaijan for a visit and you want a few local phrases, then you'll find them in this book. Good for the visitor, but not for anyone seriously wanting to learn the language."
5,Recharged,"These rechargeable batteries work well. I use them for my wireless mouse, and they hold a charge long enough for me to get some work done...which is more than I can say for the last ones I bought!"
2,For 4-Wheelers or trucks only,"I bought this book to replace Scenic Driving Oregon by Tom Barr that is now 16 years old with sites that no longer exist. I have now taken 3 of the drives and I have to say that it was not what I expected. I was wanting nice relaxing, scenic drives. But the drives I've taken are not casual drives. They have all ended up on gravel or dirt roads, single laned, with rocks as big as my head in the road. For my compact car, this was a bit too rugged. I had to turn around and head back on one of them because I was bottoming out. This was difficult because it was single lane with a cliffs on either side. These really are off-road trails. If you have a 4-wheeler truck this might be the book for you, but if you want a gentle Sunday drive, keep looking."
2,Disapointment,This book is mostly about the various medical problems and conditions men face as they get older. It should say so in its description
4,Beautiful 70's folk/rock from a group out of Hawaii,"I love many things that come out of Hawaii. I ""accidently"" discovered this CD while browsing through this wonderful Hawaiian store in Mill Valley, CA. They were playing some beautiful music and I asked who the band was. They sold me the last CD that they had and I've enjoyed it ever since. This is NOT the ethnic hawaiian music you're used to hearing but more along the lines of early 70's acoustic rock.The band writes about their love of the Islands and also about the destruction of their land due to development.It's too bad you can't listen to Sun Lite/Moon Lite as a section. It's truly a beautiful piece with wonderful harmonies.Unfortunately, like many bands of the 70s, two of the members died from drug related problems and the band self destructed. It's too bad they didn't lots more music."
4,I really like this album,"I first heard this album and in particular ""Waimanalo Blues"" while serving with the US Coast Guard in Hawaii in 1976 and bought the LP version. I have listened to the songs since then because it almost lets you feel like you are there. I am thrilled that it is now out on CD."
5,"Chris Gilmartin, O.D.","This is a detailed account of the underlying etiology for many of the most common disease processes seen by practicing ODs. I don't know of a better text for the OD student looking to gain an understanding of ocular disease in the posterior segment - ""Vitreoretinal Disease:The Essentials"" might be a close contender. The book makes use of some photographs and diagrams, but the real value is in the complex, but easy to read descriptions of posterior segment pathology. A must have for any OD library!Chris Gilmartin, ODChris Gilmartin, OD"
5,We are all beginning to suffer from attention deficit syndrome ( ADD),I think the connection the author makes between our daily activities and ADD behavior is intriguing. Once made this connection can be seen all around you with the frantic task switching we are all engaged in in our daily activity schedule e_mail - cell phones - over worked ETC. He as a Doctor in the mental health field has written a book that is useful and illuminating I think the book and it's thesis is very convincing- and can help alleviate the condition as you become more aware of what is happening to you-Good read
4,Another MUST READ from Hallowell,"Once again, Dr. Hallowell's reflections and insightful observations, provide the opportunity for each reader to glean important and, often, startling, insights on how busy and engrossed we have become. Hallowell's wonderful expressions and thoughtful care is enriching and has healing power in it. Those who have known Hallowell get a renewal of an enriched experience. Those who are experiencing him for the first time are sure to be tempted to go for much more. ALL will be beneift from this wonderfully caring physician and human being's insight and pragmatic guidance. A joy to read!"
3,Entry-level reading re the challenges of ADD/ADHD,"Like cooking, there are hundreds of books about ADD/ADHD and almost all of them cover a lot of the same ground. And while this book is no different, I think it is one of the better 'entry-level' ones I've read (and I've read about 7+) because of its convenient format (audio version can be listened to on the go); easy listenin (ie narator's voice/style); offers good perspective (ie author reminds those of us with ADD/ADHD that everyone is challenged by the world's pace); and it provides tips for coping if/when feeling overwhelmed."
4,Take the time to read this book!,"Who cannot relate to being ""overstretched, overbooked, and about to snap?"" As with his other books, Dr. Hallowell presents not only the problem (overcommitted, speeded-up lifestyles), but some practical solutions as well. I rolled my eyes along with the anecdotes he presents, completely identifying with his subjects. If you want to do something good for you and your family, read this book -- especially if you think you don't have time to."
5,Crazy Busy,"Dr. Hallowell has reminded us what we already know...that doing the most IMPORTANT things is what makes life worth living. HOW we invest our time day-by-day determines our level of happiness with how we invest our time. In my business I see a lot of people doing what's second, instead of doing what's first on their list. REad thsi book and help yourself get re-focused...and then enjoy!"
2,Dirty Dozen It Isn't,"Strictly by the numbers WWII ""lack of"" action movie. This movie is modeled after the dirty dozen, only without the budget, the talent, the script or anything else. The characters are generic stero-types of ones you've seen a hundred times before and better in other films. None of the actors seem the least bit emotionally invested in their roles and the script could have been knocked out over a weekend without benefit of a rewrite. Sorry, gotta call it like I see it. This one is below average. Dirty Dozen 5 stars. Kelly's Hero's 5 Stars, The Inglorious Bastards 1 Star."
2,An OK movie,"This movie was OK as far as WWII movies go. Let's put it this way,it didn't suck! I've seen alot better."
2,What a Bore!,"My friends and I love to watch great B-movies, but this is just a BAD B-movie. I fell asleep halfway through it, if that gives you any idea. The premise is decent, but G.I. Bro, supposedly the main character, is barely in it! It was disappointing. Don't bother...check out Dolemite or Soul Vengeance instead!"
4,Great Italian 'Dirty Dozen'knockoff action movie from the dirty dingy 70's,MP prisoners must fight for their lives behind enemy lines and stop a train.German and American forces shoot at them as they go on a mission to regain their freedom.The action is abundant and done well along with the sly tongue in cheek performances of the actors(Fred Williamson haming it up is a spectacular sight to see).The double disc is loaded with extras and features a 35 minute discussion with Quentin Tarantino and director Enzo Castellari.Can't wait to see Tarantino's version coming out in August 2009
3,Great Poet; Poorly Published,"Emily Dickinson is wonderful, but this particular edition is unsatisfactory. The book is filled with misprints (reading today, I found three within 20 pages!) It also lacks an index of either titles or first lines. I recommend Dickinson's poetry, but from a different editor."
5,Fantastic Space Heater,"I've owned this item about a week, and it has completely transformed my small basement suite from an icebox unsuitable for human habitation into a pleasantly warm abode.Most reflective heaters only heat the area in front of them, and the stationary setting on this one does that very well, but when both columns are set to oscillate they radiate a full 180 degrees in front of them. Up against a wall, that means pretty much the whole room. With one column on, it does a good job of maintaining an already warm room, but two columns really heat up the space quickly.On top of the heating capabilities, the light this heater produces is very pleasant, somewhat like a fire.The stand holding up the columns is plastic and seems somewhat flimsy, but in the case of the heater falling over there is a kill-switch on the bottom. This is unlikely to happen though, unless somebody runs into it or an earthquake occurs.Overall, a great purchase!"
4,Adequetly heats my room,"Not bad. I found the best price for this heater here on amazon. With both columns on and rotating, it raises the temperature of my living room about 5 or so degrees. I had had a few different types of heaters and reflective heaters are better suited to heating up parts of a room or a small room. If you wanna heat up a large room go for the oil filled radiator space heater."
1,Product Never Shipped,"I would love to write a review except the company never shipped the item, didn't return a phone call, emailed twice asking me to call but they were never available to speak with me.Cannot recommend this company"
5,The Best Creative Collge / Conservatory Resource,"A must have for anyone who wants to go to a college or conservatory for creative majors. If your counseling department at your high school does not have this book, you need to buy it yourself.Provides enrollment facts, degrees offered, application procedures, website addresses, contacts, expenses, student profiles, and is especially useful in addressing whether freshman are admitted directly into the professional programs or if they must pay their dues to get in.Get this book!"
1,This book is terribly underwhelming,"A great book idea, a poor authority, poorly organized. One should prefer waterboarding to this book. There is some accuracy and design in the book which recommends against capital punishment, but much rehabilitation need be forced upon the author before he is allowed to suffer the public further. I sentence the author to three to five years of hard revision."
5,2003 Hillsong DVD Hope,"Maybe their best ever (haven't heard 2007 yet). From the days when Darlene ruled the stage, before the producers wanted them to look too theatrical & glitzy."
2,Hope like all the rest,"I was disapointed with this new Hillsong CD. To me they have a habit of trying too hard to create ""stadium"" worship - but the problem is the songwriting is not great, (Yes too repetitive), and it sounds too 'big'. Also this type of sound gets old. I liked ""Mighty To Save"" because I felt they simplified a bit and it had good songs with a variety of sounds. I am a worship leader from MD."
5,Hope is the best CD in the past 4 years,"I've purchased other albums along with this: Faithful, God He Reigns: Live Worship from Hillsong Church, and Mighty to Save. This CD, however, is by far the best out of all listed. You will click with some of the songs 'the first time' you hear it. You can feel the warmth and the presence of God in the midst of some of these songs. I love Still (the 6th track)!"
1,CD was a little scratched,This CD has some great tracks on it! The person I got it from had scratched it up a little bit so there is some skipping when I listen to it in iTunes.
4,The Wreckage,Loved this book (as well as Galore and River Thieves). It owes a debt to Atonement and (like all his books) Garcia-Marquez. Loved the conflict between the local Catholics and Protestants and the young lovers' furtive fumblings.
3,Elevation attempts,"Gaudy only on occasion, these classical cut-ups were a well received counterpoint to the usual punishing brutishness associated with Funk's hyper-beats. Still, these two elements of stringed samples versus spiked beat-ings rarely merge seamlessly."
2,John cage?,"Can we say Drukqs? Or better yet....John Cage? I'm sick of this new thing in IDM, ""do some cool avant garde Cage piano songs. "" How original! Can anyone invent some new ideas? Want some real electronic music? Check out some artists on Tigerbeat6 and Audio Dregs."
2,Not what I expected,"I heard from several people how good Stevia is, but I did not like it at all. My Daughter-in-law just loved it. I gave it to her."
3,Cute but they hurt my feet.,"I just received these yesterday and they are cute--look great with jeans--but they hurt my feet. Badly. I am returning them, which is a bummer, because I really like them. Maybe I'll find some different shoes that are just as cute but not painful :)"
2,Did not measure up to her other books,"I was really disappointed in this book. I bought in in hardcover before reading any previews because Francis Ray is that good. This book fell flat from her usual sizzling passion and drama. The only good thing about this particular book was one got to find out what happened to Daniel and Maddie. After reaidn about Daniel's sister in Daniel's and Maddie""s story I had high expections for her story. I was let down but to all you Francis Ray Fans Take Heart her next book has got to be better!!!"
2,What happen to the fire. The other books were sizzling.,I thought this book could not stand with the others. It did not have enough passion. The story was so slow that it took me 3 days to finish a Francis Ray book that usually takes me hours to read.A. Barnes
3,Somewhat Enjoyable,"I must say that I was very disappointed in this book. It kinda left me wondering, and wanting more excitement. I am quite suprised though because I usually enjoy Francis Ray's novels. I think I enjoyed her other novels better. Better luck next time."
3,My fav author but....,"I LOVE Francis Ray's books, I have most of them. However, this one seemed like a fast repeat of her common storyline and I didn't enjoy it as much. When I got to the end I said, ""That's it?"" Disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this based on the ""SO SMART COLORS"" dvd which my 8 month old baby could watch and not hardly move during the entire duration.. she'd squeal when I put THAT one on. But this music-only shapes dvd fails to keep her attention for 5 minutes. So disappointed!!"
5,Best game on Earth!!!!,"First of all I would like to introduce myself. My name is Patrick Navalta and I LOVE THIS GAME SOOOO MUCH!!!! I beat this game 3 times and played for over 100 hours. One day I ever played for 8 hours!! I love the anime cut scenes and the voiceovers. Thank you Namco for this great game!! I'm obsessed with it. I have the art book, the trading cards, and even the 4"" mini figures! This game is reccomended for every people who have a Gamecube, and RPG fans. On the back of the box it says ""More than 80 hours of game play"" Thats bullcrap, I beat it in 30 hours.Well I need to stop writing this review and start on trying to beat it the 4th time. Bye! (I'm not crazy!)"
5,RPG FANS READ THIS,"This Is A Great Action Game! With 8 Characters And Tons Of Hours Of Gameplay, This Is Easily My One Of My Favorite RPGs(My First Being The Final Fantasy Series)Another Cool Thing About This Game Is The Skill System, Cooking Recipes, And Huge World Maps.(Yes, there Is More Than One World Map.):D"
4,ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS GREAT ONE OF THE BEST RPG'S SINCE FINALFANTASY 7. THE GAME IS ABOUT ACHOSEN WHICH IS TO TAKE A GREAT JOURNEY LIKE A PILGERMAGE SAYING PRAYERS AT TEMPLES TO SAVE HER WORLD. EVEN THOUGH YOU PLAY ONE OF HER FREINDS. AFTER SHE PRAYED AT THESE TEMPLES YOU FIGURE OUT THAT ONE OF YOURE FREINDS IS THE BAD GUY. EVEN THOUGH YOU LEVELED HIM UP TO LEVEL 30-40,WAIT I FORGOT TO TELL THERES TWO DISC AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST DISC WHICH I AM STILL ON. THE GAME HAS A GOOD BATTLE SYSTEM SIMILAR TO KINGDOM HEARTS [ANOTHER GOOD GAME]. YOU CAN ALSO GET MONEY VERY EASY. YOU CAN GET NEW WEAPONS ALMOST EACH TOWN. LATER ON THE FIRST DISC YOU CAN FLY A LITTLE SPACE CRAFT.OVERALL THIS GAME IS GREAT!!!!!!"
4,It's no Zelda,"I was looking for another action RPG like Legend of Zelda for Gamecube, and upon reading all the reviews for Tales of Symphonia, I was eager to purchase this game since it came so highly recommended. However, let me tell you now, it is extremely hard to get into. There are so many detailed options having to do with battle strategy, moves, character development, items, technical abilities, etc, etc, if you have never played a game like this it is extremely confusing. I almost quit in the beginning several times, and had to teach myself how to play by reading faqs and walkthroughs. The game gives virtually no instruction while you're playing unless you read the entire instruction manual. Now that I've figured it out, I think it's a lot of fun, and I'm happy to have so many character and game play options, but for someone who's just looking for another great Zelda game, this is too much work. Just be forewarned, this is not as easy and great as everyone makes it out to be!!!"
4,Availability,"This game was requested by my son for x'mas and it was difficult to find since he wanted it for the gamecube system. Luckily for me that ""you name the game"" had it in stock and in new condition. Although a bit pricey it was expected since gamecube was replaced by the wii system and the availability is scarce. Not only did ""you name the game"" had it in stock it was also shipped within a short time ready for the holiday's."
4,A bit too cookie cutter for me,"But other than that a solid rpg for the gamecube platform. While the fight system is somewhat different from other rpgs out there it unfortunately tends to be a bit more repetetetetetetive as well. Having a somewhat decent plot this game is heavily sellable on its graphics alone, beautiful cel shading that is the future of gameplay today. Representing the true beginnings of american and japanese animation and ideology. Hopefully Nintendo can continue to put out such great games as this and expand their library to include gamers of all ages."
5,best gamecube rpg,"This is the best game I've played in a long time. It's a long engaging story with quite a number of twists. Its very interesting and it begins and ends spectacularly.The gameplay is awesome, it's real time battle and you can strategize the NPC if playing alone, or play with three other friends.It's simply the best there is on GameCube, and believe me, I played over 50 good rated games of the gamecube.If thinking of buying, think no more and just buy it, its the best there is."
5,This game is the rula of the rules,"This game is completely and totally awesome. I just beat this game with my friend today, 58 hours into it. Now we're just wandering around having fun. This game is one of the best games anybody will every encounter and if you dont like it then you all got some issues... this game is THE RULA!!!!!!!!!! oh and to whoever hated the game cuz of the langauge and the chibis---grow up!!!!So if the chibis come back to haunt you---Blame your fate"
4,a pretty symphonia,tales of symphonia is a great example of the new free roaming RPG style. the music and voiceovers are well done and the cutscenes and anime style animation look good on the Cube/Wii. the actual battle system is not completely free-roaming as you can only move forward and backward but the control allow for lots of combinations. the actual story is interesting and charcters are well designed. the only downsides are the AI on both sides are sluggish and the strategies offered for the characters you do not control are pretty uninspired. overall this is an excellent game for any RPG fan.
3,It was just OK,"Both of my boys gave up on this game quickly as they just didn't like the fighting style or the techniques in this game. They are both teenagers and thought the game was 'lame'. I am playing it now, and though I know I will play it until I finish it, I am not enjoying it like I do other RPGs. I hate the 'skits' that you have to watch of just a face moving as you read the words. You can't make them go by faster and they took the animation department back a decade. Don't bother if you are looking for a involved rpg like FF. We liked Lufia, Breath of Fire (early) Dragon Quest and many more.....This one fell flat."
3,the best game of 2000-2003!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game rulz 80 hours of gameage!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it may have language,violence, and suggestive themes, butits awsome!!!!!!!!!!!! get it if u a rpg fan"
2,Shutup Lloyd...,"This was an okay game but the characters talk WAY too long. It's like ""let us play the frickin' game already!"" I think the battles look awful. They could have done so much better. When I bought it a few months ago, I played it for a few hours, and haven't picked it up since."
4,Very fun game,"I haven't played this game for a while but saw it and thought I would leave a quick review. I think it is one of the better rpg's for gamecube and wii. The graphics aren't amazing, but neither were they for some other classic rpg's like the early FF games. I liked how they did the graphics in this game. The fighting system takes a bit to get used to but was fun. The storyline was good as well. If you're looking for a fun rpg, this won't let you down."
5,FANTASTIC,THIS GAME IS GREAT YOU CAN EVEN INVITE FRIENDS OR FAMILY TO HELP WITH FIGHTS OR PLAY BY YOURSELF
5,Best GC RPG,This was one of my favorit rgs and its the best one for GC. Anyways Dont think this game sucks from wat other people say about it. Anyone who playes this game will love it(unless u dont like rgs). You can also play with your friends on this game 1-4 players. Theres only 1 problem the camera follows the first player. But other then that there nothing bad with the game. You get tons of game time 60-100 hours. Tons of mini quest for u. I never got bored with this game.I beat the game and im already playing it again. So make a good choice and go buy this game. But if your not 2 sure about rent it first. Well i hope this review was helpful for u.
4,Tales of Symphonia....A hit!,"This game is probably the best RPG to ever come out ont he gamecube console. AND GUESS WHAT???? It is 4 players! You can equip your guys with special abilities and hot keys to use them. It is an amazing game, you use magic, weapons, swords, arrows, WHAT MORE COULD YA ASK FOR?"
1,Look For Something Better,"I thought this game was gonna rock since im a huge fan of console rpgs. As it turned out im very depressed. The games graphics sucks, the gameplay is not that fun, and boring characters. So if you want a superb console rpg better than this go get Star Ocean Till The End Of Time and leave this game in the trash with the opasums."
2,Never Again,"this is the first and the last time i will order a work boot online again. i have owned wolverine boots in the past and have really like them. these boots just didn't fit very well. i gave them a chance,but no go."
3,Henri Salvador: Le Plus Grandes Chansons,"If you're a fan of Henri Salvador, and I have been ever since hearing his CD 'Jazzed,' you may like this. These are vintage recordings, and include a number of novelty songs, but also a few that are simple in arrangement, and those songs allow his voice to shine in the forefront of the production. Although dates aren't shown, I suspect most of this music is from the late 40's early 50's."
1,Not what I expected,"The music doesn't fit any of my playlists: rock, jazz, classical, meditative... He sings well, french songs."
4,One of the best guitar values,"Seagull is the king of N.A. built, inexpensive, great sounding guitars. I have many acoustic guitars, but this is one of my favorites. No frills, but awesome sound and playability. This guitar has been replaced by the Coastline series, but they are little different. Best of all, it is not Asian built, which is hard to find in less expensivie guitars."
5,Gibraltar sc-19a long flanged 4pack cym-sleeves,"TThese joints are working real good cause I can really attack my cymbals and they are putting in the work by not cracking,chipping,or splitting, keep on pushing on.Oh I almost forgot to mentionthat they screw down on the thread and stay there,so they don't come off when breaking down,now that a good thang. Peace"
3,"so-so light to be seen, but not to see with","I made the mistake of hoping this light would be enough to light my way, rather than just get the attention of motorists and pedestrians. The beam is too narrow and not bright enough for anything but really slow riding in the dark. I think it's okay for being seen, but only okay. It doesn't blink, if you're into that, and the narrow beam spread means only folks directly in front of you will see the light from afar. Check out CatEye's excellent, compact, 3xAAA- and 3 LED-based HL-EL400 for something that blinks and has a wider angle of beam visibility. For a battery-based light to see with, I found Planet Bike's 5000X to be a much better value."
5,GREAT LIGHT,"It is a great light. I only wish the side views were brighter. Its more like a spot light - very bright, but dims quickly toward the perifs."
2,Easy and does what it says.,"Set up quick, gives me the indoor and outdoor temp. Gives indoor humidity.That is all it does and it does it well. Clock sets up automatically by radio signal which is cool.The ""Forecast"" section is useless really and should be removed for something more useful like dual outside temp readings.Edit ** Had to come back and take the five stars away. This will not work when the temperature drops below freezing at all.I tried all different types of batteries, locations, etc...I ended up buying five of the sensors and they all broke in less than a year."
1,More junk from La Crosse,"The wireless functionality of this device is totally unrealistic. Stating that you have to set the transmitter (outside of your house) 3-5 feet away from the device is plain silly... So that part does not work which defies the purpose of monitoring outdoor temperatures. Second issue is that you cannot set the channel. It is broken. The web site is a joke to get help. This is the second La Crosse device I'm returning. The first one was an atomic clock that never got the time adjusted. I put La Crosse on my ""Do not Buy"" list. The act of selling junk has to stop."
1,"Works good at first, just wait 6 months.","I got this for a Christmas gift last year and it worked great out of the box. Other than batteries dying quick it worked fine. Then after 6 months the inside temperature would go crazy, jumping to over 100 degrees. Shortly after that, the outside sensor stopped working and the unit would display just two dash lines. Very disappointed would never get this model again and highly recommend to look for different model."
4,My wireless weather station,This unit was purchased as a replacement for an Oregon Scientific station that was received as a gift and which was terrible. It could not even pick up the signal from its remote when they were only 10 feet apart. The LaCrosse unit has worked flawlessly from the moment that we set it up. The outdoor sensor is about 40 feet away and transmits through three walls with no problem. We have it mounted on the pedistal and sitting on the mantel where we can check it every time we leave the living room. I am so pleased with it that I just bought a second remote transmitter. A great product at a very resonable price.
3,magic/science fiction,"This was a strnge story. It is sort of a magic/science fiction. There are ships to travel beteen the stars, but certain people can travel between stars by just going into this void and coming out somewhere else. Weird.There is a group of super rich mercahnts and a group of Mages (wizards), and both groups have competing interests amopng themselves and each other. At times the Mages need to fight to build up the power they need to do magic, emotional power, I guess. Sometimes they kill each other to get things done. Weird."
3,Complex answer to questions about previous stories,This is a complex story that answers questions raised in previous books in the seriese. The story is of interest only if one has read previous stories in this epic.
2,"Pedestrian - Been There, Read That, Only Better","We've all been here before, only with writers who are capable of creating life with story and characters. The problem with many aspiring genre writers (such as SF) is they are avid readers and ambitious writers so their efforts inevitably contain rehash and imitation of the greats. I sampled this duo. They consistently lack voice."
1,Liberia needs Liberians,"Dr. Amos Sawyer, the courageous democracy crusader who was jailed by the Samuel Doe dictatorship in 1980's and who went on to serve as Liberia's acting president in the 1990's, recently told Liberians, ""No degree of external support can help Liberia in the long-run if Liberians are not the driving force in peace-building but are simply the beneficiaries of peace-building programs driven by others.""Liberia needs committed Liberians, not American intervention which has had such woeful results, as Mr. Hyman reports. It's disappointing that after gathering together the story that he does, he concludes with the same tired and failed prescription of more U.S. meddling."
1,Liberia through White Eyes,"The author is a Washington D.C.-based lawyer and longtime operative in the Democratic Party who, thanks to a few years as the U.S. ""counsel"" for former Liberian despot Charles G. Taylor (for which he was well remunerated by funds that the dictator stole from the Liberian people), is now self-qualified to pontificate as an ""expert"" on African history. So, if you're interested in how a white neo-colonialist views Liberia, this is the book for you! If you're interested in the real story, try the books for sale on Amazon by A. Adebajo, A. Kulah, G. Williams, and other Africans."
2,"Right Subject, Wrong Author, Wrong Book","A good history of Liberia in general and its civil war in particular needs to be written for the general reading public. While several books have been written by and for specialists, a general work has still to be written.Unfortunately, Lester Hyman is not the man to do it. As ex-dictator Charles Taylor's lawyer, he's hardly an objective source. And, writing from Washington, D.C., where he is based -- he never spent much time in Liberia -- he lacks the on-the-ground experience.Consequently, the book he wrote is nicely documented, but is is more of a partisan defense of his former client and an attack on successive American administrations that ""let him down"" than an objective narrative. Perhaps the author should have attempted a personal memoir of his infamous war criminal client (that would have been fascinating) rather than trying (and failing) to write an objective historical account that requires more detachment than he is capable of."
1,We Don't Need This,"What Liberians don't need is another non-Liberian (much less one like Hyman who made his fortune by literally taking food out of our mouths by accepting monies stolen from us by our former war criminal dictator ""Doctor"" Charles Taylor) telling us about our history. As if we didn't know it ourselves. This is like the defense lawyers at Nuremberg trying to write the definitive history of Nazi Germany. Haven't we Liberians been abused enough?"
1,Not Worth The Paper It's Printed On,"This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. The numerous factual errors and biased slant are insuperable flaws. As a retired Foreign Service Officer who has served two tours in Liberia (both before and during the civil war), I would recommend the excellent work by Liberian democracy advocate and former President Amos Sawyer for the background and the scholarly treatment of the civil war by Professor Stephen Ellis."
5,Well-written mystery,"The girl dies. There is the central event of this film. The young hero investigates how and why, moving through a cast of colourful (and oddly restrained) characters in the suprisingly self-contained world of an American high school.The only downside to this film is in the dialogue: it was written wonderfully well (it was largely inspired by film noir dectective stories), but is sometimes not spoken clearly enough. Despite this, the film remains an involving story, and well worth viewing again."
3,Was this a satire on itself?,"I thought this was a decent movie. However, I did get the vague notion that this movie was supposed to be a subtle comedy. After all, these are HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. I laughed out loud at the scene in the vice principals office, as if a vice principal and a student would actually act the way they did. The whole movie conjured up images of South Park for me, the absurdity of the situations.Strangely enough, this confusion kept me watching. I just couldn't tell if this was supposed to be some dark commentary on being a teenager (if it did it totally sucks), or if it was supposed to be poking fun at the genre of films by casting the characters as high school students (which, if on purpose, was done brilliantly)."
2,Highschool gangster movie,"Ok, I really wanted to like this movie because I saw the previews on another movie and it looked very interesting. I guess that I should know better than to judge a movie by the previews. To me, this movie was simply awful. It was a bunch of highschool kids playing ""gangster grown-ups"" in a very adult manner. These kids at this age don't have that much of an organized mind to plan out such an elaborate scenario. The only reason that I gave this movie 2 stars was for the acting which was very good. The story was not believeable for me at any point in the movie. Yeah, there is trouble in the Burbs and it started with this movie."
2,Needs subtitles just to follow the absurd dialogue,"If people really exist that speak in such witty little snippets of encoded dialogue, I can't help but wonder how they would survive? Perhaps they could find work in the waste-removal industries, where the ability to communicate is not a requirement. Then again, they might also work in the lunatic fringes of bad-independent films where teenage girls recite poetic blubber while playing dischordic melodies on mommy's grand piano? All told, this film has one of the most ridiculous scripts and premises I've ever seen, and I would realistically estimate that I've seen over 3,000 movies. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that ""swallowing a brick"" would be much easier than swallowing this implausible, self-important piece of fluff. So I give the film ""zero"" stars for the incredibly bad dialogue, and ""one"" star for trying to pass a difficult storyline. But the cast was superb, and merit five-stars... Even so, I cannot recommend this film."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"This film is more of an exercise in the medium of film (playing with editing and genre stereotypes) than an exercise in storytelling with any relatability or character development. It's set around a present day high school but has very little relevence to contemporary teen culture. I assume the film's not meant to be realistic, but even taken as a stylised reality it seems to lack a foundation of consistent governing principles. This is the worst kind of film, not blatantly insulting to your intelligence but just a chore to understand without any reward for your effort."
2,"Difficult to understand the dialogue, otherwise the plot was pretty simple.","Not worth seeing. The plot is clear and you can guess who the ""bad guy"" is from the beginning, but I had no idea what they were saying 70% of the time."
5,New Favorite,"This movie is beyond good. I can not bring myself to spoil anything about it, so just see this movie."
5,One of the Best Indie Films in some years!! AAA++,"There is one aspect of this film, that seperates it from many others. It is the very creative dialogue used. Like ""Where's Dode Flopped""? And many others! The casting was very well done! One has to really appreciate the fact that even though this movie is in a modern high school in San Clemente, CA., Sometimes, I feel like i was even being transported back to a 1940's style movie. The pattern is somewhat like this. If you love a low budget movie, that is unlike any other I have ever seen; I recommend you get this DVD. You will really appreciate it. Oh, and did I mention the music score. It is really cool!Peace-"
3,110 minutes of film-school cleverness,"Not bad, but not good either. Why? Because every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue is overdone by Art. It doesn't take long before you realize you're saying to yourself, well, look how the blood is artfully arranged...hey, one side is all wearing black, the other white...notice how all the actors are standing, carefully posed in the culvert...listen how cheerleaders are saying ""push 'em back,"" only you can't see them and the hero is being chased around by a madman with a knife...etc. All the cleverness absolutely overwhelms the film.One other oddity I noticed: it's rated R, and yet I'm fairly sure I heard not a single obscenity, something that even some PG movies have. There was barely a hint of sex, and no exposed skin. As for violence, the hero gets punched a lot, and there's one--yes, arty--scene involving a gun. I guess that's what got it the R rating. Strange."
5,An instant classic,"The best film of the year, with a powerful performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree, Joseph Gordon-Levitt steals the screen, and you can be sure you will be seeing him in A LOT more movies."
5,Brilliantly written mystery,"I don't want to give anything away about this movie, it is one of those movies where the less you know, the more fun the ride is. The writing is brilliant, the characters are interesting and compelling. The style is reminiscent of the best film noire has to offer, while having a fresh, edgy style. Before reading any other reviews that give away too much and ruin it, just watch this movie and enjoy. It is a must-see and I am glad to have it in my collection."
3,"""Brick"" review","""Brick"" is well written film noir, with an excellent performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The use of color in this genre was interesting and served the high school contemporary setting well. The fast-paced barbs between characters was reminiscent of Sam Spade, but difficult to buy into high school kids thinking or communicating like that. The femme fatale was well written and overall, it was an enjoyable film."
5,What a great movie!,One of my top favorite and now I have it in my hot lil hands! Product came to my home faster than I thought it would.Thanks
5,My favorite movie ever made,"I really can't say enough good things about this film. It is so incredibly clever by blending noir with High-school drama. It thus creates a sort of ""milk and cookies"" noir genre, which I find absolutely fascinating. The story is intriguing and the script is airtight. If you are a movie fan of any kind, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film as soon as possible."
2,Arty Farty,"In Switzerland we call this kind of movie arty farty. Some nice ideas, some great camera movement, a horrible soundtrack and far away from fun."
2,A World of Children,"Yes, it's well-written, and well-directed. But I'm one of those people who simply does not buy the gimmick, this Neo-noir world inhabited only by adolescents. Adolescent ""detective."" Adolescent chanteuse. Adolescent femme fatale. Adolescent gangsters. Adolescent everything. The gimmick kills the story--kills it dead. Good writing and good acting can't revive it. I think you have to take teenagers a lot more seriously than I do in order to enjoy this movie. Indeed, you have to take them at least as seriously as they take themselves in this movie (and that's pretty damn seriously).It would have been much better using adult actors. Adult stories need adult actors. I'm not surprised this flick got such poor distribution."
2,2 star noir,"Unfocused and clumsy, although the inversion of traditional noir themes carries it somewhat. Watch if you really like noir, or if you are in hight school, or perhaps even on a lark. I like to be dazzled, and the acting I found to be lacking."
3,A good idea the doesnt quite work,"I give credit for a creative idea, a noir set in a high school, but the noir genre seems too mature for it to succeed in this setting. some scenes are almost laughable, like when an intence meeting between the Pin and Brenden is temporarily post poned so the Pin's mom can get Brenden a snack and something to drink. it shows as a reminder that the characters are still in high school and from that moment on i had a hard time taking the film seriously for lack of realism. i realize noirs are not supposed to be the most realistic movies but this seems far fetched even for a noir. the dialog is also another thing that brings the movie down slightly. the over use of unfamiliar slang spoken at the speed that is characteristic of most noir films makes it hard to understand at times. Both the young cast and first time director show promise but the limitations of the script fail to let either truely work up to their potential."
2,Noir = Bore,Very boring movie. I did not enjoy the dialogue nor the story. I'm sure some will find this movie interesting. I'm just not one of those people. Movie gets 2 stars only because I think Gordon-Levitt is talented.
2,Just doesn't work for me,"I thought that this movie sucked. It seems like a movie made by someone who took all his favorite noir movies and rolled them into one. For an added zinger, they decided to set it in a High School which I just can't swallow. It is the high school thing that gets me, it's so unrealistic it just loses me. And I get the idea that it's supposed to be semi-satire but it doesn't work for me and in my opinion just ends up being corny not clever"
3,Ummm..Interesting,"I bought this movie because I watched it once and remembered it being good, but unfortunately my memory did not serve correctly. Too advanced dialogue for high schoolers. But a good storyline and fast shipping though."
3,Disappointed,"Think Disney meets CSI. It's a really odd movie, and painful to watch. I was mad at the end. I gave it 3 stars for the good acting. The plot, script & directing are laughable though."
4,The real mystery is what kind of high school kid writes this,"Originally made with a high school cast and written by a high schooler himself Brick is re-casted with B actors who act well above the roles they've been given to this point. A true throw back to noir while making the change of adding color and pulling it off Brick is an excellent movie all around. The lead actor, Gordon-Levitt, is really working to establish himself despite hardly seeming to age since Ten Things I Hate About You. In the end you will feel good about the adventure of the movie, despite its hard and dark edge. A definite movie to see sometime in your life."
1,Complete Crap,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, I couldn't even watch half of it. It's suppose to be about high school students, but they don't even act or talk like teenagers. ""I've got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick"". who the hell talks like that? I'm sure there is a rare weirdo who would likes this type of foo-foo crap, but not me."
1,It's all about the 40's!,"It's all about the 40's! Both my wife and I are 44, and we both stopped watching it 43 minutes in! We looked into one another's eyes for 41 seconds, and after rolling them, said in unison, ""You've Got To Be Kidding That Was the Worst EVER!"" (By the way, that phrase with Characters, Punctuation and Spaces -- totals 48!I'm glad to see WE weren't the only ones to quit in the 40's minutes mark of the film. This is BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!!!!!!!"
1,"Not from professionals, comes from students","The whole things about this movie seems did as a movie's student. The script, the directing, the acting, the music, the timing, the tricks...all seems a student's homework or project to pass some test in a movie college.If were my son's first movie perhaps I'll love it, but is not."
2,Ambiguous. Didn't understand this film.,"Okay. This film has a nonchalant style of its own, it has a pretty good plot setting start and from then on, I was utterly bamboozled and I don't even use the word. I didn't understand the storyline. I didnt quite get the plot. The characters seemed dazed to me, they made me feel dazed too. The acting was a bit too inward. The villains look irritatingly queer. What is brick,anyway? The best thing about this confusing ride was the end. The fact that it had one. Not since Lady in the water, have I seen something so confusing."
1,Swallowing a brick would've been more entertaining...,"I don't know where this film was trying to go or what the director was thinking, but it doesn't hold up as a feature film. Maybe it should've stayed a student short film...seemed like one. I wanted to desperately shut this film off after 40 minutes. The acting, story and direction made me want to vomit."
1,What the heck was this??? Bad Bad Movie....,"I never write reviews unless I feel pretty strongly. I made it 3/4 the way through this movie (would have stopped earlier, but I thought it had to get better) and had to shut it off. It was trying to be new and different, but just ended up to be cheezy and boring. Maybe I just didn't 'get it', but I think a lot of people may not then."
4,Glad I'm not young.,"What absolute negativity our children must endure. This is a film of children (OK, teens) dealing with things that should not be visited upon adults. A few may dismiss this film as being unrealistic, nihilistic, or simply a dark fantasy. Having lived in one of the most populous cities in the U.S., and then living in one of the most isolated, I can only see the universal truth in this film. Drugs are to kids now days to what sex was to boomers. The muse has turned dark and deadly for today's children. At least this film has the cajones to bring our collective secret out into the open. No, we are not a privleged country. No, our children are not squeaky clean. We face daunting challenges and it's films like this that can make us aware."
2,Kuless,"A soulless, robotic exercise. I've realized I'm in the minority here. Most reviewers seem to really dig ""Brick."" The film gave me a headache. Sure, it's interesting taking the film noir template and transferring it to a modern high school setting, but after a while I couldn't stop thinking of the Notorious BIG's ""Sky's the Limit"" video. It's an entertaining three minute concept, but two hours of the same gimmick is tiresome."
4,Condition was great.,"Only thing I was unsure about was it sounded like something was loose inside...thought probably the DVD and was hoping it wasn't broken since it seemed to be loose inside during shipping and may have moved around and gotten broken in transit. But, when she opened it all was well. Maybe should have been fastened down better somehow. I'm super satisfied with the end product though and my daughter was excited to get it for Christmas."
5,Possibly the best noir mystery in years.,"I'm not going to go too much into the plot or characters here other than to comment on writer/director Rian Johnson's sincere love for the art of Hammett/Chandler-esque dialogue and direction that evokes the heyday of noir rather than the cookie-cutter flashy trash that most young directors seem to grasp hold of, is truly refreshing and amazing to behold. The plot itself is a bit of Hammett's ""Red Harvest"" (possibly his greatest work) and Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"". It's tense, a little convoluted, but breathtaking to behold. The performances are all spot-on and the juxtaposition of the 30's/40's era dialogue set in a comtemporary high school never seems silly. You know that this is not ""our"" universe as much as it is a universe of noir and pulp-isms. And being aware, you're already in on it and you take the ride and enjoy every minute of it."
2,Horrible dialog,"The trailer was very intriguing, so I was excited to watch this movie. I was so disappointed. The dialog was so bad, as if the writer was just trying too hard to sound witty and smart. But what came out were words that sounded kinda like English, but I had no idea what they were saying. The actors mumbled a lot, too. At the 53 minute mark, I ceased to care what happened next."
2,Weak,"I thought this movie looked cool from the preview, but it was a bit of a bore. I had a vague idea of what the director was going for, but it just wasn't there. Film noir meets John Hughes. The female lead is intoxicating, however.Not worth the four bucks."
3,Ok,I searched for Zannies because they are supposed to be safer for dogs than the chemicals used in actual tennis balls. The felt still comes off in the puppy's mouth--and that is no good either.
4,Great,Great learning tool! The voice speaks clear enough so the child can understand. The different games are nice also. The sounds are not so loud like most toys. The low volume is the best setting. A great toy...
2,More Junk,"Gone in ""60""seconds was a great film~I am really sorry it had to be backed up with such a poor continuance~The acting""if you want to call it that""is the same as the first one in the series.The stunts are way over the top~but,if I had known the over all movie was going to be so bad with rambling non coherant scenes(oviously cocaine WAS popular in the 70's).I would just settled with Gone the 1st one~and had nothing to do with the other two in this triogly~Save your money~Or better yet buy""Highwaymen""~"
3,Ok,"This book was all right. It wasn't very exciting, but it wasn't bad either. You can tell that it was one of Mr. Sumner's earlier works.."
3,Castle Keep,"This is a terrific little low key performance. Good sound quality and featuring many of the bands rockinest numbers stripped back to a semi acoustic sit down showcase standard.The video direction however is less than inspirational. A two or three static camera set up and plenty of long shots of a daylight performance. Shine A Light this aint, but as a document of a hot band at an one off event playing killer tunes... It's good."
2,Overly simplified look at important battles in history!,"In the writers attempt to get 100 battles in, he has forgotten to justify why he chose the way he did. Although it is easy to see how most of the battles chosen were on the list there are several examples of questionable choices. The author also writes down to the reader. Most of the book is written at a fifth grade level and is not enjoyable for a true historian."
4,NOT SO BAD,Some battles were left out but it wasnt BAD. Has some battles that really didnt shape history. Writen in about 7 grade level.
3,Very simple look at Wars,The author tried to do listing of wars for 3rd Grade level. In other words he worked more in placing a picture for every war.
4,A great book!!!,It is a very good book on most of the battles! But it left out a few battles that shaped world history!
5,Excellent book for the laymen,I love this book because the way Mr. Grudem speaks is like having a chat with a friend not talking to a intellectual. The issues he covers are clearly presented in ways that make it easy to follow. The systematic approach is clear and concise. Another thing I like is I can go back and grab a chapter for review and not have to worry about having read the other chapters. One final thought is that I appreciate how both sides of an argument are addressed. The author doesn't simply state the position he believes and leave you wondering about the other side of the story. He discusses the challenges that the theological position he is taking often faces.
3,"Clear, concise, but tilted.","Was happy to get this book and appreciate the clear, very simple way it explains classic orthodox beliefs. But I have some concern that while it only takes 4 pages to summarize Christ, 3.5 pages for the Atonement, 2.5 for Resurrection, it then devotes TEN pages to Election. Wasn't too keen on how the large segment of the Church which does not hold such a rigidly reformed view are characterized in that chapter as well - a wee bit condescending. So maybe the subtitle should be ""twenty basics that every reformed christian should know."" Otherwise, it's good!"
3,"Well Written, but...","This book is very well organized and readable, created for new believers (or for those who have never grown in their knowledge of the Word yet), and for the most part stays on common doctrinal ground. The one fatal flaw for me, is that in two chapters in particular, it is very Calvinistic (or as another reviewer put it, ""reformed"") in it's views. A pity that the author didn't just skip this volatile issue or at least present the accepted options. For this reason, although a great part of this book is wonderful material (I am always looking for great discipleship material), I cannot in good faith recommend it or use it to disciple new believers."
5,Clear and concise,"An outstanding overview of the basic doctrines of the Bible. Grudem makes Christian theology clear, concise, and compelling. An excellent primer for seekers or new believers. Answers common questions and whets your appetite to delve deeper into Christian theology. I believe this is one of the top ten books every new Christian should own."
5,Great introduction of theology,This is a great book to start basic theology with. I am a minister and a theologian and I bought several copies to give to some friends I am mentoring. Wayne Grudem's theology is sound and easy to understand proving that theology does not need to be communicated using arcane language and obscure metaphores. This book is a must for any Bible believing Christian wanting to understand the deep things of God and his word!
2,Its kind of whiny but still an under-told story.,"As a gay man in Wisconsin, I found it refreshing to read about others like me, many times gay culture is supposed to be urban. The book misses when it fails to show more of the positive aspects of living in a small town. Indeed, I think most in town know about me, yet I enjoy their acceptance. It was an ok read, little continuity. But in my opinion, overly negative."
3,Farm Flavor,"The book has interviews with Gay men who grew up in farming communities. They're arranged by date of birth, and the biographical information ranges from funny to sad, and from stories you'd like to hear more of to stories you wish they had left out. I enjoyed the chapters with the individuals who had been fully interviewed. Unfortunately, some of the chapters were short and a little off-topic.All in all, I'm glad I read the book, but it could have been done much better. If the subjects had been interviewed instead of just sent questionnaires, they could have been kept on-topic, and not allowed to ramble on about minutia. It really could have been a good book."
3,Well yes it is a switch.,"Does what switches do best. Switches. I haven't had any problems with this, it has been up on my network for about 2 weeks. Be warned though the documentation is very poor."
4,Louisana Law of Sales and Lease,"I took Professor Litvinoff's class so I read this casebook quite often. If you are looking for a historical perspective of the nominate contracts of sale and lease, your search is over. Subjects cover all Louisiana Civil Code provisions relating to sale and lease as well as select revised statutes. The casebook is suplemented with selections by Planiol and other Civil Law commentators as well as exerpts from Prof. Litvinoff's law review publications."
1,Piece of crap,What a ripoff! I ordered a model car and what I got was a paper cut out of a car that had to be glued/taped together. It came with stickers and no paint. SERIOUSLY??? I was so disappointed when I opened this up. It was a gift for someone and I was embarrassed to give it to them.
4,A Very Nice Collection of Later Asia,"I wouldn't have thought it, but I actually like this later Best of Asia collection (Axioms) better than the Heat of the Moment Best of earlier Asia. Even though the earlier collection (1 Disc) has more recognizable hits, this one (2 Discs) has better overall sonics and really better crafted songs. This title gets repeated spins in my player. Just plain good music with some progressive roots. Highly recommended."
3,Fatigue mat,"Really wanted this to help. After standing on it for only 3 hours my heals were killing me. It is made well, the right size and I like the slope on the edge, the only problem is its as hard as the concrete floor. Back to the gel mat."
4,It brought tears to my eyes,"When I first heard A face on a poster I was sitting in the dark and I thought who has this angelic voice. The words brought tears to my eyes, beautiful lyrics and sweet voice."
2,Not Much Blue in the Grass,"I have to downgrade this album to only two stars. In most of these selections Bradley has dropped the fast pace and high lonesome sound that are the hallmarks of bluegrass music. It appears that she has joined Nashville by moving bluegrass ""uptown""."
2,Steer Clear Of This One !!!,"Almost as Bad as ""DirectX Game Engine Design with C#"" !!!Sorry, but I would steer clear of this publisher (Apres). They now have allowed to badly editted books out the door. There are a few nuggets of interesting information here, but this book is certainly not for the beginner. Poor examples, Poor code explanations. Just an overall confusing book. When will we get a good C# game programming book. If you are looking for a good beginners game programming book look at Sams publishing's ""Learn Game Programming in 24 hours"". I wish that author would write a C# edition!"
3,Good book; out-of-date samples.,"This book is well written, moves from simple to complex examples, and at a level at which intermediate level programmers can easily follow. The first game samples are based on GDI, and the latter ones on DirectX 9. HOWEVER, the samples have not been updated for the 2004 Summer Release of DirectX, so they are unusable without a lot of tweaking. Hopefully the authors will update the samples (which can be downloaded) to make the book more useable."
2,I've tried to like it...,"I'm surprised this book has gotten the reviews it has (I actually ordered it based on them). The errors in the code/instructions are horrendous, and I'm only on the second chapter. (Many steps seem left out) I suppose I cannot understand why someone would write a instructional book and then fail to follow their own steps to check if they work.That being said, the book is not all bad. I've learned a few neat things from the previous chapter. I suggest, in the future, the author(s) include source for each 'step' in the projects and have others check their instructions. I would be entirely lost without the downloadable source code (apress.com), but it's a shame readers have to rely on it.If you can, check it out at a library for a week before you buy."
3,"It's a buy, but only if you download the source code for web","Sorry to say this, but there were some pretty glaring errors in the code listings in the book. Structure of the book did not follow the required code writing to make entry in the programming environment possible without compilier errors. Unfortunately, the errors in the book forced me to rate this lower than four.Overall, the material and examples were good. I strongly recommend that if you do get this book make sure you download the source code from the website, otherwise your examples will not work, however you can get around these problems if you know C# just requires a little additional head scratching. Authors do know their stuff and source code on website compiles without error. Nice Tetris example at the beginning that will introduce you quickly to some of the basics of gamewriting. Book goes quickly to connecting with DirectX and networking topics."
2,Okay Bag,This bag is sturdy enough for the job of carrying one ball and has plenty of space/pockets to hold all of your gear.The downside is that the wheels on the bag are so small that it will tip over very easily while rolling. It falls over when going over the smalles bumps and door thresholds. I wouldn't recomend it. Find something with a more stable base.
4,In the Mood For My Trip to Japan,"I am about to visit Japan for three weeks, so wanted to get in the right mood. After reading about Chikuzan Takahashi in Alan Booth's book, LOOKING FOR THE LOST, I decided to order this recording. I'm happy I did. Although it took some time for my Western ears to get use to the sound of the shamisen (a 3-stringed banjo-like instrument) it soon had me fascinated. Takahashi produced complex, spellbinding magic with those three strings. He was a virtuoso of this instrument. I'm glad I opened my mind and ears to this strange and beautiful music!"
2,Not too sure if I like it....,"Okay, I gave this CD two stars for a reason.They have great beat but they sound like whiney 12 year olds.And the guys sound... Well, they don't sound right.And SORRY if this offends fans but, I gotta speak out!If you want some better more mature singers, try Superchick, Barlowgirl, Zoegirl, Stacie Orrico, John Reuben, Ginny Owens,and if you're not christian but you like to listen to Jump5 for fun but you want a more mature group/band try Superchick, Stacie Orrico, Avril Lavigne, or No Secrets.And SORRY if I offended any fans. Thanks Lots! :-)"
1,Not convinced...,"I am still not convinced that Jump 5 is in the least bit musically talented. However, I do have to admit, they are on a step up with this album. I bought it after hearing ""Why Do I do"" on the radio. I kinda liked the song lyrically, but it was still kinda annoying. I read reviews and heard that it was gonna be a different album and not so ""poppish."" That's a good thing, because I'm not a big pop fan! Anyway, I haven't listened to the whole album yet, it was too annoying!!! The only 1/2 decent song is ""Wonderful."" I have heard them in concert and they just are not talented...I'll just keep with Jeremy Camp, Relient K, Superchick, Everyday Sunday, and Switchfoot!!"
3,Interesting book... but not sure how accurate it is,Bought this book because the concept sounded intriguing... but after reading name descriptions I am questioning their accuracy. I would buy a used copy and have you judge for yourself.
3,Interesting but not really accurate in our opinion,"An interesting idea but did not apply to most people we know with the names in the book (which are limited)...so no not really good for getting ideas for names. There are better books out there but although it was initially entertaining it got old when it just did not really apply to the majority of people we knew...we looked at about 20 names for friends and family and we thought...this is inaccurate for those in my and my husband's lives anyways...seems to be too much based on chance, coincidence...but certainly nothing scientific or credible about the way the author(s) come up with their info."
5,As you THINK you are...SO are You!,"This book opened my eyes to how significant the SOUND of words can be.The word choices we make can convey a meaning while the actual meaning of the word can get lost because it may have a negative sounding cousin- like the word niggardly; it means stingy, but the intention is lost because so many overreact to the ""politically incorrect"" N-word. This is the reason for many an argument when one is thought to say something that one did not intend...the meanings get lost in the interpretation. What one word means to one person can be mistaken and misinterpreted in another.This book shows how we should be very careful in choosing names for our children, for what we call a person will affect what they think they are all their life. What can be more significant in you life than how you think other people relate to you, and who you think you are?I wish ALL teachers and people that work in public life could read this book. It helps in understanding human nature."
2,Too much grain,"Many of these recipes cannot be used by people with grain allergies, yeast or IBS and gluten sensitivities. If you have any of these problems you'll probably want to look elsewhere."
3,fell a bit short for me,"I must say I really enjoyed the premise for this book - the fairtale retelling of the Wild Swans matched with a modern story of a young man who is also searching for family. I found that the author DID make a lot of connections between both ""worlds"" and that there was poignancy and meaning to both as well. Unfortunately, I found that the characters weren't passionate enough for me. Some of Elias' thoughts just seemed to be words on paper and not heartfelt emotions - or at least the author didn't choose words that conveyed the emotion to me...At any rate, it's still an enjoyable book - one worth reading."
2,I just couldn't connect with the characters,"SynopsisA retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale parallels the story of a 20th century young man. Both are cast out of their homes and must discover how to stay true to themselves while being persecuted by the people and circumstances around them.ReviewUnfortunately I found this book difficult to get through. I was not able to connect with either of the main characters and found the supporting characters to be flat stereotypes. The pacing was a bit awkward, and the parallel story lines were confusing at times.My RecommendationI was just not a huge fan. 2/5 - If it happens to be around, it's OK."
5,"Not what I expected, but magnificant still!","I purchased this book simply because of the author. After having read Emerald House Rising, and finding it stunning, I was willing to give anything by Peg Kerr a chance. I was not disappointed. I picked up the book one morning and finished it the following evening; loathing putting it down as it was completely captivating. The book intertwines two parallel plots, although they do not truly appear parallel until you reach the end. The plots appear so completely different that it is a stunning feat for the author to have brought them together so perfectly. Had it been written by anyone else, I would never have read this particular book, as it does not seem to be a part of any of my customary reading themes. Altogethor a very worth while, not to mention horizon expanding, read."
4,Interesting,An oddly touching fiction which I found interesting. But it was missing something I can't quite pinpoint....
5,A wonderfully moving novel,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I thought that the stories fit together well, though I respect the opinion of those who disagree. If you thought that Alec and Seregil's relationship in Lynn Flewelling's Nightrunner Series was believable and well-drawn, I think you will get a lot out of this story as well."
1,2 stories: Puritans and Gays,"First off, I want to say I liked the author, I just didn't like the subject of this book. It should have been two books, in my opinion.It was frustrating to read 2 entirely different stories, that did not seem to have anything to do with each other. So much so, that I found myself skipping ahead so I could contine story 1, then going back to pick up on story 2.Story 1: The age-old Swan story with a Puritans-persecuting-others twist. The self-righteous, selfish, lying clergy who with many of their foaming-at-the-mouth followers, were ready to hurt anyone not like them.Story 2: This one was so depressing! It rehashed the terrible time in the 80's when AIDS was first discovered. This whole story was about homosexuality with religion thrown in. Sad and cruel.The author wrote well, but I would have never picked up this book if I had known what the subject material was. I was expecting a nice Swan story. So if you are looking for a happy book, look elsewhere."
3,Where Are The Other Songs?,"I bought this CD and am very disappointed because the songs I like the most are not on this CD. The main reason I bought this CD was to listen to the Five Blind Boys, and they are not on this CD! They were in the movie. I don't understand."
4,This is a really good fun catchy album,"especially if you saw the movie, you can visualize the song performances which were great, with Cuba's hilariously frenetic thrashing about (directing) through every performance. Its got great inspiring Gospel mixed with some good ol fashioned devils music."
3,"After second thought, the soundtrack's rather routine!","When I reviewed the film from which this soundtrack comes, I called the music ""great"". After purchasing the soundtrack and listening to it several times, I must amend that particular assessment: the album is ""fair"" but not as I labeled it before.The songs need the movie's visuals for them to succeed. Tunes like ""To Da River,"" ""I'm Getting Ready,"" ""The Stone,"" ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,"" ""Loves Me Like a Rock,"" and ""Time to Come Home,"" while enjoyable, worked on film because of the combination of music, setting, character reactions, and all the other ingredients necessary for a musical film.The songs lack their ""punch"" when standing alone."
3,Pretty Good&should have Been Better,"right off the Bat I'm digging the Gospel Tracks far&away the best here.Ann Nesby,Shirley Ceaser,The O'jays,and the cut with Beyonce&Bilal works as well.but the other things on Here aren't happening for me at all.this Album could have been a Classic if you take away a few of the filler Tracks.Ann Nesby for my Money could have handles all the Main tracks.She truly brings the Flavor on this Set."
5,"Great movie, nice soundtrack","I have to admit that at first, I wasn't really feeling this soundtrack, although I loved the movie, but the more I listened to it, the more I liked it."
5,AWESOME SOUNDTRACK,"This CD is so great....a mix of wonderful gospel, hip-hop, and r & b songs....Beyonce's versions of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" and ""He Still Loves Me"" are reason alone to buy the album....If you are a Beyonce fan or a fan of this type of music, then WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR????? GO OUT AND BUY THIS!!! YOU WON""T BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!"
4,The Fighting Temptations (Soundtrack),My family and I are really enjoying this CD! It's refreshing to listen to music with clean and encouraging lyrics.
5,Incredible,"It is incredible! Beyonc?'s five octave voice just graces the entire album. She can really SANG. Some songs that really stand out are: Swing Low Sweet Chariot, He still loves me, Time to come home, the Summer Jam and title track Fighting Tempations , and the Destiny's Child Reunion on the Song ""I Know""! Beyonc?'s, Kelly's, and, Michelle's vocals are BEAUTIFUL! Buy this album ASAP.P.S. Also Pick upDangerously In Love: Beyonc? KnowlesSimply Deep: Kelly RowlandHeart To Yours: Michelle WilliamsALL OF THESE ALBUMS ARE INCREDIBLE!"
3,This isn't GOSPEL,"Yeah Beyonce' can blow but this isn't a gospel CD, just a soundtrack to a movie. Nice to uplift you. This was a feel good movie about making it against all odds. I do like the song with the O'Days. It reminds me of something my grandfather would play."
1,upset,ok.. so i got the cd and i have a windows vista. and the cd will not play in my laptop.. upset.. LOVE the movie but upset that the cd will not play
2,A disappointment,The soundtrack was a real disappointment. Some of the songs on the cd were not in the movie and must have been some of the first songs recorded by Beyonce because they were terrible.
3,Attractive but very easy to break.,"Anyone who has bought this product, or is looking to buy it, already knows that the body on the car is not the most durable thing you can buy. One crash and it's done! I was also surprised that new body clips weren't included."
2,Bulky; how are these MMA shoes?,"If you plan on ordering these shoes you should order a half size up. I normally wear a size 10.5 and ordered these in size 11, they do fit well. However, these ""MMA Shoes"" are bulky and not light feeling at all. I don't see how anyone could engage someone in combat in them. They are so wide around the ankle you can definitely tell your wearing big bulky shoes. No one in my Kung Fu class wears Ringstar and I can see why. They don't breathe at all, they are completely sealed from the outside air. They get two stars only because of build quality. They are a poor design, but are built as well as they can be for what they are.I recommend ASICS wrestling shoes over these a thousand fold. They breathe and are under 10 ounces. They also conform around the ankle and don't have unnecessary/extra material."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this mat because it had suction cups and a good surface for my dog to stand on while being bathed.The suction cups DO NOT hold. The pad slid all over the bathtub. I finally removed it, then threw it away.Save your money."
2,Not as shown in photo,"We wanted a round, swing-out mouse shelf. What we received was a cheap keyboard tray with a square mouse tray that slides out. This company should send you what they show in the photograph! Now I have to go thru the whole return process. Very disappointed."
5,Gets Below the Surface,"With the arrival of Apple Motion, there was very little get to the point instruction being offered. The Apple manual just didn't seem to get to the bare bones of the software, thereby leaving expensive DVDs as the biggest alternative. And I'm hardly knocking the Apple Pro Training Series readsApple Pro Training Series: Motion (Apple Pro Training)because I think they're great. What makes Motion for Mac OS X stand out is it's tremendous reference value. Need to know something? Go right to it. No tutorials or slick tricks, just basic ""how to"", and I like that. The more ""how to"" I get, the more creative I am."
3,Kind of small,"The art is nice and all, but I wasn't expecting it to be so small. It looked like it might be the size of a campaign pin from election times, but I was suprised to see that it was maybe the size of a quarter. It's cool either way."
5,Epiphone Guitar,This item was just what I need at the time. It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged.
2,dissappointed,The originaldescription said it had light wear from use and was missing some strings. Wjen i open the package not only was it not the original body but the screws holding the neck in were ripped out they stamped the word used into the back of it and there was no bridge. If it wasnt for the awesome customer service who helped alot with the return this would have been zero stars
2,Not impressed,Went to local place to check out hands-on. I was not impressed at all. The thing just felt cheap. I could not imagine playing it for long. It was not fun to hold and parts looked cheesy.
4,good buy,"I have been playing for years, and this is one of the few out of the box ready to play that i have ever found.. excelent, even my other player friends like the feel the action and the sound. have enjoyed this guitar a great deal, hasn't made it to the case as of yet. very enjoyable to plae and pleasant to look at. thank you so much"
1,Dissapointed,I recently purchased this item. I hardly played with the shuttlecock for 2 minutes and it ripped apart. I used the other 5 shuttlecocks in the pack and it was the same story.Dissapointed!
1,don't waste your time,"I tried to order these on sept. 7 for an event on sept 22, with 3-5 day shipping. A week later i check on line and it says they won't even ship until Oct. 10. Customer service from the seller was no help. Customer service from Amazon has the literacy level and problem solving skills of a second grader. #amateur hour #FAIL"
1,"Halex Shuttlecocks, White (6-pack)","Not a good shuttlecock - the rounded cork base is too small, which stucks in the Racket when you hit the shuttlecock. Will not buy again."
4,Pretty good shuttlecocks,"These badminton shuttlecocks are pretty good only thing is these are definitely not for professionals only ametures. The only thing is that sometimes the tip comes off but thats no problem, you just screw it back on ( if you didn't loose it)"
1,Inferior Product!!,The worst shuttlecocks I've ever seen. Bottom part detached from the shuttlecock after 1 minute play. Totally knock-off cheap products. Regret buying it.
3,Birdie,"What can you say, they're birdies! Not the best quality, but we'll just be bashing them around the backyard. How good do they have to be?"
1,Possible Worst Album Ever,"I have not bought this album, nor listened to it in its full extent, but the samples on this site is enough to know this album is a horrible, horrible effort by an annoying singer with really stupid lyrics. I first heard ""Monsters"" on the radio a few years ago, and while listening to the song I actually broke into laughter because it was SO bad. And I'm sorry, but the reviewer raving about this band needs to listen to GOOD music. Try Tool, or even Mudvayne (Lost and Found is their best album). If you can't handle the screaming/grunting/shouting, etc, buy Simon and Garfunkle's greatest hits."
5,the best band ever!,"all of you negative reviewers are nuts.this cd is amazing as is the band.brad has some major vocal abilities, and the heavy yet melodic tunes DO stick out.i love antithesis of oragami and monsters.i highly recommend this cd.it is fantastic!*shinedown!"
4,travis mackinaw il,I think that if u like bands like mudvayne or element eighty then you will love this group of guys with there guitar playing song writing everything about them is good enjoyP.S.RAP SUX
2,v shape corny $***,"Wow.... Talk about a rip off of ever thing else that comes out these days.. tool anyone. When i first popped the beautiful shiny disc into the player i was awaiting for the ""pleasures"" that reviews said i would indeed have.. However, i was fooled. *hits play button= same old crap... if you want something worth your time that really isnt some band copying something else, then i recommend you give up on everything coming out these days. go back to past artists.. because it looks like the music scene today is a bunch of regurgitated semen... thank yousome good cds....1 aIc-dirt2 cannibal corpse-gallery of suicide..just kidding this stuff is major turd3 any red hot chili peppers4 any nirvana5 metallica6 godsmack7 jimi hendrix-now thats the ripest $H&&8 Incubus-one hell of a bandppsRAP SUCKS bad"
2,Glitches.........,"Since I am not the type to beat around the bush, I will get straight to the point.It is true that the vocals are ""new and different"" but that does not always connotate something ""good."" After listening to the into songs on this disc, the vocals and heavy, yet repetitive guitars annoyed me. After all the good reviews this disc received, I was wanting to be pleasantly surprised.....Right.If you are a fan of straight-up hard rock, i would recommend Systematic's Somewhere In Between and Ra's From One. These two bands pack the heavy sound and are ""refreshing"" also. Thank you."
4,Very cool,"If guitars annoy you then you shouldn't listen to this cd. The band plays some mean, easy to listen to riffs that I find real catchy and appealing. The music contained is actually musical if not with a sort of gothic feel. It's not the headache pounding metal so many groups play, thank God. VSM kind of reminds me of the old Smashing Pumpkins Siamese Dream cd in that it's not aggressively sung but aggressively played at times. It's mellow rock music from the hearts of good musicians that no doubtedly spent some time writing their material. No rapping, no screaming, no wimpy stuff neither...so if you can live without those being in your music, you should find it easy to drift away by listening to V shape minds cool lyrics."
4,"Fun, challenging and overall, a quality game","If you like war games, especially WWII, then get this game. It is fun and challenging. I think the graphics are very good. The action at times is almost overwhelming and it gets my heart pounding at quite a rate! I was not disappointed with this game at all. Personally, I like that sometimes you don't know if an enemy is actually dead or just wounded... war is like that... not making sure can kill you! I also did not find the lack of save points a big problem. It forces you to be more careful and to think about your mission. Otherwise you just run, shoot and save all the time.Overall, a quality game, not the best ever, but right now it's on my top 10 list. And... the slow-mo scenes are great!"
3,Enemy At The Gates...,"I believe that you are either an MOH man or CoD man, I am an MOH man and gave CoD a chance to rise above MOH and quite frankly it rises like soufflé.It was all good gravy loading the game and getting ready to land on the shore in the first mission, but the graphics were archetypical Activision and took me back to the halcyon days of the N64, which the graphics resembled.I thought the gameplay was slow and the graphics fused with the background on many occasions and trying to focus on one thing at a time was impossible. The guns were pseudo realistic but the sound was uncanny.The characters were straight out of a Bond film, the Russians sounding like they had escaped from The Hunt For Red October, The Brits who all sound like Brian Blessed and with the Americans I was waiting on them stating that `they never watched there buddies die face down in the mud for this'.Not bad but not particularly good either, but still worth a go. [...] you'll enjoy it better."
1,More like Call of Duty:Easiest game to get killed at in the 1st level,"I've thought Call of Duty Finest hour was fun,but it seems to cheat on you.to unlock the cheats in the game you have to beat it,the germans will kill you easily because of your small bar even when you're playing easy mode.your comrades can be easily taken down and it seems the missions in the game are a little too frustrating.On the good side you'll have just the animation reel so sit back and watch the film...Or maybe you should give Medal of Honor:European Assault a chance?"
3,Hard to find item....,this item is hard to find since it is not sold in retailers anymore. I was able to purchase 4 boxes and delivered under a week.
1,Works - but tastes terrible!,"I have tried this product along with Alka Selzer (which tastes better, but is not as fast), before finally discovering Brioschi.Brioschi is just as fast, and is much more palatable. I have been using it for about 30 years, and would never go back to Bromo!"
5,Bromo Seltzer is the antacid choice in the Prendergast household.,"When the manufacturer notified me that Bromo Seltzer was going to be discocntinued, I made sure that I obtained an adequate supply. I use the product once or twice weekly with good affect. My wife uses the product as well as an antacid. Like Bayer Aspirin, Bromo Seltzer has been and will be a staple in our home."
2,Uncomfortable,This brace was not for me. The canvas is not comfortable and the inside is not lined. I use mine for everyday wear and this was just not up to par.
1,"What do you mean ""Translate into English"" ?","(One star because I have not read this book yet.) The previous reviewer says he wants to ""Translate (this book) into English.""In what language was it written ? Or does he simply means ""laymen's English"" ? I was going to order this book, but now I'm not sure."
1,Fact or Fiction?,"At our book group last night, several of the eight men couldn't believe Snyder's book. I didn't like the book because I couldn't stand Snyder's character, but I had not thought to challenge his veracity. The general feeling was that he was not a man anyone of us want to know, and we wondered if his wife is still with such a selfish, arrogant man."
4,Snyder: Those CANNOT do will get a job TEACHING????,"Don Snyder: Heard you on the radio. You seemed a decent, honest man. However, remember the old saying.""Those can do will do, those cannot do will get a job teaching"".. Please, Please, Please teaching English is not a REAL job.Anyone can BS in front of 18, 19 years old. The academic world has ""HARD"" subjects like science, math, engineering, medicine, and ""SOFT"" subjects like arts, literature, humanities.The English department is what we called ""bonehead"" ""no brains"" ""mickey mouse""If you had been teaching in the mathematics, science, medicine, engineering departments, you could get another job overnight.Please, teaching English Literature is not a real job. The Internet, Computers hopefully will obsolete these jobs and all these phoney jobs, phoney people will have to real jobs."
3,Who died and left you king?,"The premise of the book was quite engaging but lost its appeal by the total disgust I felt for the author. I couldn't decide if his sniveling attitude (whoa is me) was more offensive than his sheer arrogance. His total disregard towards his family and financial obligations was beyond belief. As for his wife, the question remains - - sainthood or stupidity? Maybe an equal dose of both.I finished the book in one day and walked away from it thinking , this guy still doesn't have a clue. He gives educators a bad name and reinforces the adage, those who can...do and those who can't... teach! Give the reader a break!"
2,Disappointing,"I chose to read ""Cliff Walk"" because my husband temporarily was without a job and I thought I would be able to relate to Snyder and his jobless situation. Instead I learned how not to act under jobless circumstances.While reading the book I felt very sorry for Snyder's ""clueless"" wife and their children who I hope do not grow up to have dishonest,fantasy lifestyles like their father."
2,My book club selected this book,"I would have preferred it in Kindle form but it didn't come that way. I thought the book was only fair - about a professor who lost his job at the University through downsizing, and was resistant to working at anything less ""erudite""...and his wife whose only interest was to be a mother and continue to have babies (no concern about this being practical, with her husband unemployed). He eventually was forced to take the only job he could, as a construction worker. He found unexpected satisfaction in construction jobs well-done and cameradie with fellow workers (which redeemed him in my mind to some extent)."
5,Inspiring,I got this book after seeing it on one of Oprah's shows. Truly an inspiring story of a man who lost everything but later on found everything important and essential in life. I envy the author for he already knows what truly makes him happy.
5,How to find inner peace,This book helped me find relief after being fired from 26 years at a major company two days before Xmas. Inner contentment far exceeds six figures. Don Snyder is a hero to himself and to his family I will read this many times!.
4,A Story About the Ultimate Career and Identity Struggle,"This is about the hard-hitting reality of losing a job you love and not ever being able to get back into the field ever again no matter how hard you try. Overall the writing was well-done and it was interesting, but I was hoping to feel more enlightened about how to reconcile this type of life experience. However, the writer conveys the sense that part of his identity was lost with the teaching job, and though he did learn the benefits of a different kind of life, he still seemed broken in some ways at the end of the story. I was hoping the ending would be more uplifting. But overall, good writing and very interesting."
2,"Yea, right.","To borrow a phrase from Don Snyder-which nicely summarizes the book nicely-blah, blah, blah. Or said differently, lazy, lazy, lazy. Sniveling? Yep. Dishonest? Yes sir! Lazy. You bet. But Snyder overcomes all of those character faults by the end of the book. The problem is we have to listen to his slothful and narcistic attitude for more than half the book. I wish he would have gotten to the good part-about making an honest living as a working man-much sooner."
4,"Brutally honest, insightful, agonizing, and human","I read the book from start to finish without interruption. I loved it and it meant a lot to me. It allowed me to connect with somebody going through the same things I was, but articulated his feelings and understood the process much better than I have. I am not an English teacher or an academic, but did lose my corporate job two years ago and have not been able to find my place in the world. It is happening to a lot of us who are 40+, made some decent money and fame, and now just cannot get back in. I thought the book was brutally honest, insightful, agonizing, and human. Only two issues I take with it: There was a long period when Snyder was depressed that was just glossed over in a matter of paragraphs. I would have liked to know more. Similarly, his reemergence as a self-employed laborer could have used more ink. Perhaps these will be included in his next book."
5,"Succinct - It spoke to my heart and within my fears, I wept.","""I hoped that she would not be carried off by the desires that had carried me from place to place, never satisfied, always waiting for life to match my expectations."" It was this painful realization that Don J. Snyder wrestled with. He forbids himself the thought of ""stepping down"" to work for a living. Waiting, hoping, expecting at any moment for the mystic gift to appear. Nothing, and perhaps this is the ultimate gift! He see's the significance in being and doing and not expecting. Painfully honest - I read this book in four days, living the time past, today. Laughing and crying, imagining myself in his boots"
4,A Tale of Promise and Hope,"While not 'Grapes of Wrath' nor 'River of Earth', this is a well written story of a man's journey from a 'secure' professional life, to one we frequently see as 'beneath' us. A life that may offer much more than we expect.Rather than struggle to make it in a poor world, this man must face his unrealistic view of himself, and the requirements of the 'real' world. In this 'downsizing' world it is a valuable map through depression to serenity.Regardless of the truth of details, the story raises valuable questions, and presents one man's answer to the biggest of them. What is really important in my life? How do I measure myself and my values?"
3,"The best of books, the worst of books.","You want to pull for Snyder to make it, then he reminds you of just how selfish he is, and it's hard to have any sympathy for him. I nearly put the book down several times, but stuck with it just to find out what becomes of him.I feel for his family, and in the end, I suppose he's a decent guy, but not someone I'd want to know well."
4,it could happen to you,"A brutally honest and intriguing look at the stages we go through when employed. The writer wasn't just unemployed, however, his former life as a college professor was golden enough to give a deep-set but false sense of security that things would always continue to be that good. But whatever you chalk up other people's unemployment, too, you can't dismiss Snyder's with an easy explanation. Finally, he moves his wife and children and began doing manual labor. Snyder doesn't shy away from portraying his less than flattering side, but when he finally tells his son, ""You do the work right even when you're working for a jerk,"" you're on his side all the way."
4,Nash's most personal release,"I was very excited when I saw this album had finally been released on CD as I had long since worn out two copies of the LP. When this album first came out it was in my car player for months. It's is Nash's most personal album and deals with the early years of his marriage, the birth of his first child and his hopes for the future. It is a window into a truly gentle soul who has the perfect voice to convey those feelings. Musicanship is great with camos from Stills and Crosby. The packaging is decent with full credits and lyrics provided. Liner notes would have helped. The CD it self has excellent sound in a 24 bit remaster. For the heftly price it would have been nice to get some bonus tracks."
2,"Great album, Poor sound quality","Well, we've waited a long time for this one to be on CD, and musically speaking it's well worth the wait. But I have doubts about the source tapes used for the remastering process. Yes, it probably was 24-bit, but did they master this one off of a cassette? Limited dynamic range, compression, etc. Maybe someone will do a better mastering job on this good album."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"First, it took forever for the grill to cook most of anything. Then, in the middle of cooking on the side grill, the line connecting the propane to the grill exploded off and sent propane all in the air, and fire! The fire was shooting out the side of the side grill and required a fire extinguisher to put it out. I will contact someone tomorrow about refund or what to do next."
3,Cheap and damaged grill,The grill is not worth the retail price of $199.00 The body is made of plastic and the cover of thin metal. I received mine with broken plastic and sent it back for a refund. I had only paid $64.00 so it would have been a keeper for that price if it had not been damaged. I did not order a replacement.The best feature of this grill is the fold-up leg design.
2,Aussie Adventure Grill With Side Burner,"Much to large and cumbersome to us as a ""portable grill"". Works fine as an extra grill at home"
3,"Ad is, as is usual for Amazon, INFO POOR.","What are the dimensions of the assembly? Are we supposed to buy it and HOPE it fits? Does the absence of a shroud deplete the effectiveness of the fans? Please Amazon, get your suppliers to give you more info on your products (or whoever posts these ads).PS - Looking at the draft post I see Amazon says this review is FROM Hayden. It is NOT. It is FOR, or ABOUT, the Hayden fans and the lack of info for them.."
3,Over the top shock horror has some good moments,"The movie is a stylistic companion piece to the Evil Dead series, esp. Evil Dead 2. The setting is an isolated woodsy area where it just happens a nameless horror has been released. The cast seems mostly young and rather inexperienced. The effects work is cheap and rather cheesey. Sound familiar Raimi fans? The big compensation for such shortcomings is in the camer work. Lots of fast moving point of view tracks though the woods to create excitement and interesting shots with great back lighting effects, to create an effective sense of menace. This is key to any low budget horror. Closeups of cheap monster makeup are kept to a minimum, a very good thing. Low budgeters like this can slip over into laughable pretty fast. As a result this movie has some genuinely effect shock moments, more so than the usual Japanese horror."
4,Glorious Improvisations by a Master,"This album is a fitting tribute to the amazing imaginative powers of Pierre Cochereau. Recorded at his beloved Notre Dame during his last weeks, these improvisations are ample evidence that Cochereau left us at the height of his powers. There is a breadth of vision that surpasses that of the earlier recorded improvisations of this great master of the art; nothing is done for show alone. No effect is gratuitous. Cochereau summons all his resources to illustrate the Gospel according to St. Matthew. The full resources of the famous Cavaille - Coll organ are heard here as well, as they were in their unrestored state; sadly, the instrument was in pretty bad shape in the winter of 1984, and the tuning may be difficult for some listeners to tolerate. For this reviewer, however, the sheer power of the Cochereau's conception and execution far outweighs such considerations. This is indeed a most fitting testament."
1,Disappointing and full of cliches.,"I bought this book sight unseen because people who'd bought it on Amazon also bought the Jan Karon books. I was disappointed. It's just a romance, without any of the charm or diversity of the Jan Karon series. I found the characters and the requisite romantic mix-ups and misunderstandings to be cliche, and didn't see any sign of the humor reviewers here at Amazon have ascribed to Higgs. Very disappointing, though someone looking for a very light romance novel might find it just the thing."
5,Favorite new author!,MIXED SIGNALS is a treasured find. Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down. The book is filled with delightful characters every bit as lively and lovely as Jan Karen's Mitford's. Highly recommended.
4,A Delight,"This is such a delightful book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it without reservation. This is the first book by Liz Curtis Higgs that I've read, and I will surely read more by her. The characters are interesting, the setting is one I've actually visited and that made it very special to me, and the story is engaging. Try it....you'll like it!"
3,Good information but waiting for version 2,"Really good information, and I'm glad I bought it, but I really wish the author would consider doing a revision. It appears as though he just discovered CTRL-C, because there is a lot of repetition of information. So it's thorough, but if you're judging by the number of pages there's probably at least 10 pages of repetition. On the other hand if you'r into skimming chapters this makes sure you don't miss anything covered earlier.As a mechanical engineer I think some of his reasoning is a bit off, as far as things like metallurgy are concerned, despite that his conclusions seem reasonable.I'd buy it again but read it with a grain of salt and there's definitely room for improvement."
1,This book has a misleading title.,"While not an expert, I am also not a novice engine builder. So, buying a book titled ""Pro Engine Blueprinting"" I had certain expectations. Mainly, I expected to see either an intelligent discussion of advanced concepts or at least the specific viewpoint of an expert on these advanced topics. Instead, the book is at a very basic level. It does describe some rudimentary aspects of engine building in a very basic manner. The editing is poor and there are many typos. I do not reccomend this book. But if you are a novice and still want it, I am selling my copy!"
2,Short version,This is an edited shorter version that the original seen on HBO. They cut out completely the part where the mistress has a son that comes back and writes his name on the family tree at Bagatelle. I was very disapointed.
4,"Difficult, but good","Not always an easy reading style, but a facinating look at early American culture. Many original documents and letters are reproduced which give an authentic feel of the character of those times. Sometimes difficult to read, but the effort is rewarded by insightful analysis of unfamiliar facts, stories, and events."
1,Dont buy this gun!!!,I had this gun for four days when a peice broke on the inside and now it wont shoot. You should buy the spas s12 for the same price.
1,This Gun Sucks,I had this gun for thirty seconds and a piece had allready fallen of. And the pistol what can you expect from something free. Do Not get this gun
1,worthless piece of junk,"There should be a law against selling worthless junk like this. Yes, the shotgun looks nice but the first few times my son casually used it a piece inside broke and would get lodged behind the trigger. After a while we had to completely take the gun apart to remove the piece. By that time the barrel also broke off and the gun completely quit working. My son had the gun for less than a month. This was a hard lesson to learn. I'll give it one star for it's looks before you use it."
2,You pay more than what it's worth...,I bought this shotgun about a year ago. It is pretty bad and doesn't even have a sight. You can look down the top of the barrel because it works like a sight but it takes longer to aline it and isn't very accurate. The pistol can't even shoot BB's across my yard. I gave this product 2 stars because of it's strength and hi magazine capacity. I tested it's strength by shooting an aluminum can with it. It put a hole in it and put a dent on the opposite side of the hole. The magazine holds 100-150 rounds.
4,Pretty Good,Pretty good gun. Material is a little cheap but its good for the price! Shoots semi slow but is still great fun!
1,AVOID,Crashes frequently. No discernable product support provided on website (may be discontinued?) I was never able to finish a song with this. I have since purchased Finale SongWriter and it is fantastic. Get it instead.
2,poor,"One is still working and one stopped working after the second week,they appear to be made of a poor quality,woul,d not buy again.."
4,"The Female Equivalent of Dave Barry's ""Guide to Guys""!","Ms. Bahtishi's book had me giggling from the first page. Her chapters on our unique way of handling guilt, shopping, over analyzing, parenting, and the myriad of other wonderfully unique ways we see things only confirmed that I was born into the best club on the planet. Women will shake their heads as they read about all our wild and crazy quirks, then just as quickly nod at the magnificence of being female. ""The Trouble with Women"" should be required reading for all men, especially newly engaged men who want to understand the woman they are going to spend the rest of their life with!"
4,It does the job,"I bought this because I'm going to download some movies and tv shows, even though I should have bought and external USB storage memory, but whatever I wanted to go cheap to free up some space on my laptop."
3,OK,"Well known and supported by many disc drives. Some brand are not universally supported. Now it is 4x, faster than the old version. Had some failures ."
1,Only Support a few Rewrites,These disk can only be rewritten a few times. I had Staples generic discs prior and they allowed overwriting at least twice as long.
4,Good value for the money,This is the first time I am buying the writer disc. I believe it will do the job as described.
5,Can't Find A Fault,"Well these are DVD + RW and are really the safest way to go in terms of making fully functional DVDs with menus and such. I reused one disk three times for entirely different projects and the quality of the most recent is just fine.As for erasing, I use Mac OS X Snow Leopard and simply use the built-in Disk Utility to erase the DVDsOther details: Capacity is 4.7 GB each. Label side color is orange. They feel sturdier than other DVD-Rs.At the end of the day good quality dvds. I'm satisfied."
4,Best I have used.,Other brands quite often after having been burned by several of my recorders are not recognized as having any content by my players. This rarely happens with this product.
3,Wouldn't work in my LG dvd player.,"I bought these because I ran out of Memorex DVD+RW discs. I thought I'd try Sony this time. However, when I tried to create a DVD with my DVD player, it created an endless loop. The player asked me if I would like to initialize the disc. I said yes. It started initializing it, appeared to finish, but when I tried to do anything with the DVD, it asked me if I would like to initialize the disc again. I did not have this problem with my Memorex DVD's. I have an LG dvd player. So, I gave the Sony discs to a friend who can use them to store pictures from their computer, and I am going to order some Memorex's instead. I'm giving this item 3 stars instead of 1 because I think this product will work fine in most instances."
4,good purchase,"good price, good qualitythere were a couple of disc i have had trouble recording on...but ..overallan excellant purchase"
3,Doesn't do what I needed,These don't have enough space on them to do a full back up for a computer when running windows 7. I ended up having to go a different route to do a full back up again. No where on the package does it say if they are pre formated. Don't know what I will do with these since I can't use them for the reason I got them. With windows 7 it's suppose to take like 5 disks and these disks still WILL NOT let me do a full back up on a regular bases.
1,misrepresented,"this is actually 1x-4x, if you've got a recorder that takes 4x, this will not work. seller (ANTOnline)also refused to refund money."
2,Don't work with all recorders,"Tried these Sony DVD-RW's because the reviews said they work well in LITE-ON machines. All the disks I tried worked fine in my LITE-ON 5005, but NONE of them worked in my LITE-ON 5045. They just sit there for 10 to 15 minutes then are rejected as ""Invalid Disk"". Since I bought these to transfer between both machines, they are useless for my purposes. LITE-ON recommends Philips DVD-RW's and I've never had a problem with those, in either recorder. Will be going back to the Philips DVD-RW's."
5,Sony DVD-RW 25 pack disk,Great product at a good price.With other items my order came to over $25.00 and was shipped FREE! This is why I shop Amazon.com
5,Works Great!,"Had been doing some shopping around for some dvd's like this, this one came out on top as it was the cheapest and had the best reviews. So did this live up to expectation? Yup! I have burned about 10 of these disks, two of them gave me burning errors on my mac (little tip, if you get an error in finder, and even though it seems to work, RE-BURN! Thought it was all g, and i ended up losing my photos when I deleted it off my HD :'( ), so I'm not sure if it's the acutal disk, or if it just needs a reformat or something in disk utility.All in all, Great Disk! I would buy these again if I need to."
4,Reliable,"Arrived on time. I have gone through all 25 DVDs and not one of them gave me any problems. So far I have only erased and rewritten a few of them, but they seem to be doing just fine. My only complaint is that they only come in sets 25,but other than that, it's a great buy."
4,surprise,"I was surprised when I opened the CDs to discover that all of them were not gold in color, which is what I had expected. At least 2/3 of them were black, which is very hard to write on with a black marker."
4,Would purchase again,"This was a good value for the money. We had to discard a few disks that did not work,but overall we were satisfied with the purchase."
4,"best value, individual disc-wise","I've tried several brands of -/+ RW discs for recording. So far, the Sony +RW has had better audio and video on playback.Also, Sony seems to give you a little bit more for your money. I like the 25-disc packages. Anyone else wants to charge--on average--$1 or more per disc. Maybe if I was making a living editing, recording or whatever I'd swallow that but ...why? I paid less than half that and got a great deal.I've burned 7 discs so far and no coasters yet. (Knock on wood)The biggest , and really only thing, I found I did not like was the storage case....EXTREMELY flimsy and cheap. That cost this product 1 star.Other than that, enjoy!"
3,disappointed,"Usually this is a good product. But by the time I tried to use the one spindle, it was too late to return. The plastic bottom was broken on the case or spindle, so it must have been mishandled. Nearly all of the 25 discs read ""disc error"" after recording if it even gets that far."
2,Exreme arrogance for restricting use of items,"I have always used and bought Sony products for their quality and ease of use for most products. I will never again buy a Sony product such as TV,s DVD/VHS recorder/player, or any so called ""Smart Product"" that they come out with. I bought Sony products for over 50 years and depended on their quality. But now that they have found it necessary to put in blocking for recorded disc,s, even though it is perfectly legal to copy my own personal DVDs for protection against damage or loss,they have gone too far. I do not plan to sell or give away any copies I make, but Sony has seen fit to block my own use of my own copies for my own library of my favorite movies. It is just too much for me. I understand they want to protect their movies and programs but why don't they go after the real thieves like China and India. We are losing our rights little by little to corporate greed and arrogance as well as big governments intrusions into our daily lives. Goodbye Sony"
2,a disappointment,"as a big fan of the band's first Lp, I have been waiting a long time for their second, so I eagerly purchased this EP when I saw that it was available, only to be sorely disappointed. There is not a single song on this EP that touches even the weakest on their debut. The songs seem half-developed, the best (ironically) being the demo that is the second track. The Fall's Mark E. Smith performs guest vocals on two tracks, both of which boast decent riffs but little else. Sadly, based on this EP, I have no intention of buying the new LP."
2,Baby Phat? REALLY ?,"Not the best looking earrings. The babyphat logo is barely carved out all the way, and the metal is way too heavy to have hanging from someone's ear.This isn't sterling silver.I bought them as a gift for someone; She loved them, I'm so-so about them !"
1,Deservedly obscure,"Thane's non-Williamsburg novels show a troubling pattern of starting strong, with a compelling heroine, and then insisting that she choose between a satisfying career and the man of her dreams. Poor Sierra's singing success makes her long-time love feel less of a man and thus unwilling to marry her. The novel's tension derives from how long it takes her to Sacrifice All for True Love to a hero who hardly seems worth the bother."
1,Unintentionally Funny,"I got a very few laughs out of this very dreary little tome. ""Chapter One - RFK: The Man Who Loved Children"" rather unironically resembles hagiographic bios of Uncle Joe and Uncle Adolf, among other leaders who cultivated public images of being friends of the little ones. If you enjoy pious, sentimental and self-congratulatory trips down memory lane, you'll love this book. Otherwise, I'd suggest that you take a pass."
4,Nice for the alphabet,"I have a lot of Pumpkin Master items. I got this cd rom because I thought it would have pretty much all the same stencils that I keep purchasing-so that I could just print them when I want. I grow my own pumpkins and like to carve several.I am a little disappointed that it does NOT have that many pre-made stencils on it. That being said, you can put in your pumpkin dimensions and use an assortment of eyes, noses, mouths etc. to create your own jack o'lantern. Or you can make your own statement with the alphabet it also includes.The tools are not that well made, but work just fine as long as you are careful with them. I'd keep them away from kids-I had them out at a party and the kids pretty much destroyed them sawing stems and whatnot.If you'd like a more detailed stencil and or a better selection of them-just buy the kits at the store. But this is still a fun kit for the money."
3,Mixed Review,"The Mystery of Gumbo Grove started off wonderful, with a nice setting(a small South Carolina town),and an interesting plot(a young girl explores an old cemetary, discovering many stories about her town's history). However, as it went on, it strayed from its' original plot. This made for an anticlimactic storyline throughout a large majority of the book. Towards the end, however, the plot picked up, making for an exciting unraveling. Despite its' obvious faults, I would still recommend this book to children looking for a good adventure."
4,New Best One review,"New 1999 Japan S.C. CD ""New Best One - Silver Convention"" (This 16 track CD has many ""rare"" tracks first time on CD including ""The Boys from Liverpool"", ""Madhouse"", ""Summer Nights"", ""Telegram"" (single version!) and Penny's tracks ""Dance Bunny Honey"", ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" and ""Midnight Explosion"". Also, Ramona's track ""Save the Last Dance for Me""! (with a fabulous picture cover!) This is a ""must have"" for any ""true"" fan like myself!"
4,Why not MADHOUSE indeed?,"I second Ricardo from Mexico in questioning the whereabouts of one of Silver Convention's greatest efforts, MADHOUSE. Together with SAVE ME(their debut), MADHOUSE stands as their darkest & most interesting recording. Please release this soon...& would it be possible to release it with the freaky original artwork?"
4,RELEASE THE MADHOUSE LP ON CD PLEASE,BY far their most amazing record to date why MADHOUSE has not been released on cd is quite amazing...cmon someone get to it and release that amazing album...The final release for the 3 original girls of silver convention
3,I DID NOT CHOOSE THIS BIKE***THIS IS NOT A KETTLER,"FIRST OFF, I thought that this bike was a Kettler because Toys R US has it listed under Kettler products (it's a Kiddi-o product, duh). I was trying to choose between these two trikes. One was the Blossom Trike and the other was the Kiddi-0 Steering ST2 (this one). Obviously, Kettler trikes are better made and have a 3 year warranty. This bike has only a 90 day warranty. This bike has great features but, personally, I'd rather have a bike that was better built and lasted."
5,The Best Christmas CD Ever.,"I have had two copies of this album on Tape, and am now purchasing the CD. We have worn out both of the tapes because we have listened to them so much. When you walk into a very nice store at Christmas, and hear truly excellent Christmas Brass playing, it is probably this recording. I highly recommend this album, for year round enjoyment."
5,Brassy Christmas,"If you like the sound of brass ensembles, this is a great Christmas CD. The well-known and almost-well-known seasonal songs are played in a bright, bouncy style. The arrangements are imaginative and interesting."
5,One of the best Black Metal records,"One of the best Black Metal records period. If you like Hellhammer, early Sodom, early Bathory, Blasphemy, etc you'll love ""I.N.R.I"""
3,As cliche as rock gets,"What was O.C.S. thinking? Obviously they weren't.. The title track's lyrics will make any poet wince. As much as I respect the musicianship of this fine U.K. band, they have a marketing team as bad as any in rock & roll [including Ben Harper's friends at Virgin}. For as good as this band is [The Circle, Hundred Mile High City, Hello Monday, etc] they can't seem to choose the right singles to release in the U.S. market, so they've just given up. Genius. It's called market research.. Take a page from Barry Gordy at Motown.. But pass on this single if you have any sort of intellect whatsoever.."
2,Very Loud!,"The footprint is great for the minimal space I have, but the noisy fans are driving me crazy. I am sending back to Amazon and buying a table top Haier. I had a larger Haier wine refrigerator a while back that was silent - I miss it, but I don't have the room for it."
5,Godfear,"If your a christian or not, this is a MUST READ book! You must see how simple it all really is! This book will open your eyes and blow you away when you see just how wonderful God is to man. It doesn't matter if your a christian or not, this book will help you better understand what God is and what God is doing. Buy it today! Apart from a bible it'll be the best book you buy hands down!!!"
5,Take lots of notes!,"Craig Winn and Ken Power have given readers a rare view into corporate America in this book. For anyone intimidated by the business world, the book shows that real people with real hopes and dreams run it - and most of these people are good people. But being good doesn't mean that you'll succeed, despite your best intentions - because, unfortunately, there are also the ""not so good people.""Great intentions, a sound business plan, generous investors, brilliant employees and a dedicated vision to the company wasn't enough to keep Value America at the top. Discovering that a few bad apples can indeed spoil the whole bunch was totally eye opening! The authors reveal the step-by-step undoing of the company by those malicious few in a way that is both fascinating and horrifying - but all true! It was amazing to read about the company's truly wild ride - and the lessons were invaluable to anyone who ventures into big business.Read this book and take notes -and always watch your back!"
4,Very Useful,Myself being new to the world of auto repair & restoration enjoyed and learned a great deal from Chilton's. Diagrams & explainations are very helpful!
2,Barely worth watching,"Unless you live and breath for Brooke, skip this DVD and just watch the E! version on TV... the 10 minutes bonus footage is more of the same, and the production values are almost non-existent. Too boring to be entertaining, too tame to be titillating (despite having posed for Playboy, Brooke doesn't give us a peek) -- I'd recommend a nice Sports Illustrated Swimsuit video if you're looking for PG-13 babe entertainment."
1,brooke,she comes off like she is bored to death about the whole thing not mush to look at tired looking will find some better later on
4,Sof t and sweet pony,"We were frustrated with the carrier this came with. It would not hold! I finally bought another strip of Velcro and made it strong enough to hold the pony's weight. I do like the carrier now. When we go out, I know Ry won't drop or leave her toy somewhere by mistake.My 4 year old got this (after months of saving her pennies) but was disappointed. My 2 year old loves to wear it around the house and pretend she is taking care of a baby.My 4 year old says she'd rather play with her baby doll than the pony.It is very soft and easy to clean!! The diaper is easy for my youngest to put on by herself. The brush is cheap plastic.(At our home it has taught responsibility-since my 4 year old saved her money for it and my 2 year old thinks she has to feed it following her meal times. lol.)"
5,3 year old LOVES it,I got this for my neice for Christmas...who is 3 and she absolutely loves it. It makes cute sounds and she loves to carry it around. I highly recommend this toy if you have a little girl that is about 3 or 4.
3,cute but.................,"I bought two of this for my two daughters ages 2 and 3 and there very cute and soft and durable but they dont play with this at all I think I saw my younger doughter playing with this like two times and they have this for two months,and the carrier does not work ... I hope this helps you... they were asking for this every day but now that they have it they dont play with it"
2,Did not work with my operating system.,I have attempted to load this program on my computer but it says that there is a file missing and it will not load. I am using Windows Vista the the Lotus program seems to not be compatible with it.
5,Easy Graphics,I found Free Lance much simpler and easier to use than Power Point. But yet it can still give the freedom to create presentations of professional quality.
5,Powerful Music,"I first purchased this as a vinyl album in the 1970's - all of the cuts are INCREDIBLY POWERFUL and the music here is BEDROCK SOLID. There's not a cut on this album that does not please. IT'S ALL GREAT!I recall that this album by Kathi MacDonald came out at the same time Claudia Lennear's album called Phew was released. I remember being cash strapped and having to decide which of the two I would purchase. I purchased Insane Asylum and enjoyed it tremendously. Since then I have tried to obtain a copy of Lennear's Phew and find that it seems to have disappeared into obscurity - very sad, because all reviews of it were extremely positive and I recall David Bowie listed it in his top 25 list of albums. If anyone out there has suggestions about how to obtain a copy of Lennear's Phew, I'd greatly appreciate it."
5,Please Somebody! re-release this on CD,"Kathi McDonald is a stunningly powerful singer and this is a brilliant star studded attempt at making her the next big thing. She stands toe to toe with some of the best musicians of the era and creates smokin' thunderin' blues rock. Since then her occasional attempts at come backs are all cool and some really geterdone, but this is the record that made me a rabid fan. St. James Infirmary with Sly Stone is one of my top ten favorite recordings of all times. I still play my vinyl and I don't think I'll be parting with $500 for some ripoff import any time soon.Comment - this is now out on CD at a reasonable price. Buy it now before they discontinue it."
5,Thanks for small favors,"I bought this in the 70's and kept patiently waiting to see it on disc. I grew old waiting, but it finally made an appearance, and I scooped it right up. Kathi is such a superb singer and interpreter, and thankfully she is still going strong. Her versions of To Love Somebody and Heartbreak Hotel are definitive, not just covers. I always treated this LP with special care, because I never saw it at record shows or in used bins. I guess I'm just piling on with praise here, but I can't say enough about this one. An excellent supporting cast, an amazing singer, and a splendid time. This album kicks butt!"
5,Light Bulb,Has been very effective in the blending of outside Christmas lights. It has done well for the first year and no major outages.
1,Very Poor Product,Very poor product. Simple clear bulbs painted with blue. The blue burnt off after only a few nights of use.
1,Weak,It feels like nothing but it's really weak. If you stay less than 5 sec this might work ( lol ) because in the first 10 sec this things will break. This stuff is useless.
3,mistakes in this book,"firstly i must apologize you for my english:) im not from usa...i've read this book, because im interesting in Eastern Africa. It's nice story about love, Corinne was in love with Kenya, with Lketinga, but she hasn't known much about it.She was in Maralal,and in Northern Kenya(and in other places) - but there arent any Massais!!! - only Samburu. Samburu people are very similair to Massais, Lketniga was Samburu...I think this book is interesting, shows relationships beehwenn people from diffrents culturs,but it contains mistakes...I 've met Massai people,when i was i n Tanzania, they're everybody really friendly and nice...I'd like live in Kenya too, maybe not in ""manyatta"":), but somewhere in Kenya..."
3,Not THAT bad,"Sigh... Okay... it WAS pretty campy. The switch between scenes was pretty confusing and the story was a bit weak. But, c'mon... what chopsake movie was ever billed as high drama... the combination of high tech weapons combined with traditional and a little sorcery, time travel, romance and a music track that could have come from Love Story??? The perfect movie for cigar night with the boys (or girls). Oh, and we can't forget to give kudos to whoever did the subtitling... That (unintended) humor alone adds a star. Bottom line - if you don't expect high art, it is an entertaining flick.... it doesn't make much sense, but it is entertaining :) Enjoy!"
1,why leon? why???,"*sigh*...i really like leon...but this movie...was crap...:Phe has good hair in it, though. but...don't waste your money for that!"
1,Just Awful,"Avoid this at all costs. The story here is so confused that it's nearly impossible to tell what is actually happening. The subtitles only add to the confusion. To express how bad this movie is, I'll end with this...I watched the movie before reading the Amazon review and I could not figure out what the premise of the movie even was. Nothing syncs up and nothing goes anywhere."
5,Biased review,"I titled this biased because I am Tom Maher's son. I helped him with some of the computer work and read it along the way. My father has a unique perspective on the Silicon Valley having started in the early sixties and helped develop Seagate to legendary status with his manufacturing skills and management techniques. People who have worked for my father speak highly of his skill as a manager and as someone who involves his staff in the creation of product and productivity.My father, also having been born and raised in Iowa, has a unique and entertaining way of delivering his message which I am sure you will enjoy if you read the book. Get a little history of the valley from one who helped shape it. [...]."
5,THE knife that's a 'must-have' !!,Wusthof's knives are very efficient and comfortable to use. They are well-balanced to give ease of use and make food preparation a joy!! I kept seeing chef's using these on the Food Network & tried this one first. Now I know why they use them and have added many more to my knife block. Great investment for any cook who values efficency and good results from their efforts. The Classic White is beautiful and as easy to keep clean as the Black Classic. The White also makes a 'different' gift for Brides!
3,cool disk,the fairly odd parents are my fav. so wen this came out i was so happy. it a great ep. so i give it 5 stars.
5,Concert in Rhythm,This album consists entirely of popular music which has its roots in classical compostions and does a wonderful job! It is among Ray Conniff's very best.
5,Classics the Ray Conniff way!!,"Ray Conniff and his orchestra livened up the classics in this offering. Tchaikovsky,Debussy and Ravel's music receives the Conniff touch in this C.D. which was first released over 46 years ago. My personal favorites are Rhapsody in Blue and On The Trail. It's great to listen to these tunes still today as when they first came out!!"
2,I'm not happy.,It arrived with a broken screw that attaches the neck to the body. Which is also the same screw that the strap hooks on to. Not to mention the pick guard has air bubbles in it.
2,Happy but...,"Guitar is gorgeous, Sounds greatish ""now"" but had some issues when I I tried to start learn/playing it (did not sound right and I was finding it hard to play), I bought this to learn guitar on so I took it to a friend who plays and had him look at it and see what he thought... his words on what was wrong ""a complete maniac set this thing up omg"" he put a straight edge on the neck and it had approx. 1/32 bow, the action of the bridge was set up at an angle that put the low e string about 10/64 above 12th fret and the high e string was darned near touching, soo he adjusted the truss rod and bridge and in his words got it setup close enough for me to start doing excersizes on but will need to be taken in and be professionally setup because he has some suspicions about the nut and and first fret and he did not have the tools nor the know how to mess with those, so I am looking at another 50 bucks or more to put this guitar in proper order and am not very happy about it."
4,Some pig!,"My son fell in love with this pig puppet at his horse therapy lesson. The trainers hide various animal puppets in the shrubbery around the ring and talk about them with the kids. They play ""I Spy"" and similar games with the toys. Ever since my son first saw this puppet, he has wanted one! He named the trainers' pig puppet Bacon and has mentioned Bacon several times over the past few weeks. I decided to order one for my son for Easter and he is THRILLED! It's made of a very durable material and the hand opening is large enough for an adult but easily maneuverable for a child. My son has been carrying his own Bacon around with him ever since it arrived in the mail. We couldn't be happier with it!"
4,Pleasing!,"As a die-hard fan of the Forgotten Realms storyline, I've found this to be one of my favorite books. Being the player of usually Lawful Evil characters, it's refreshing to see the main character of this book not Elminster, Drizzt, or a Harper, but one of the bad guys themselves; a decidedly Lawful Evil Loviatan cleric.Though the writing is not to the level of the more well known authors in the FR fiction line, it is quite entertaining, dipping into one of the more hilarious storylines in the source books (That being the Church of Entropy, a bunch of idiots who worship a Sphere of Annihilation). Seen along the way are Were-crocodiles. That's never a bad thing!"
5,Great book,"While the diety may be evil, the main character is not. This book was fascinating to me because it described the reasoning and ideology of a supposedly ""evil"" church. It turns out their goals are actually quite noble in a way. They want to empower people by making them stronger.And to me, that's really what this book is about. The narrative is just a vehicle to describe the church of Loviatar from the inside. I wish there were more Forgotten Realms novels like this actually."
3,This was the best?,"This was an average book. Not an overly original plot, none of the characters were gripping or charasmatic. I find it hard to believe that out of 500 submissions, this was the best of the lot. The Priests series as a whole has been underwhelming, and this book continues the trend. Personally, I'll looking forward to more of Richard Baker and Paul S. Kemp, the current stars of Forgotten Realms."
1,Sad really,"It is authors and books like these that continue to show that there is no evolution in the novels put out by wizards of the coast...they only want action, no character development or originality, it is really very sad. You want a good fanatsy book...read someone like Sharon Shinn, Glen Cook or Mercedes Lackey and steer clear of poorly written amateur books such as this one."
4,A must read for anyone interested in religion,"&#65279;Really good book! I would recommend this book to anybody. While their chapter on prophecy hints their dispensational slant (referring to the significance of Israel occupying Palestine and the dates 1948 & 1967), they don't spend a lot of time on the subject. The book makes a strong case for the existence of God that a non-Christian could read and understand. I enjoyed their lists of books at the end of each chapter for people who want to read further on the subjects discussed."
1,Unconvincing,"The authors try to give 20 ""compelling"" reasons, that Christianity is right - and to the extend that other religions or atheism differ they are simply wrong!This attempt fails miserably!The chapter on Intelligent Design simply shows that they have not understood Darwinism.The chapter about the origin of the universe is equally flawed. The Germanic tribes centuries ago needed Wotan to explain thunder, today we know better - but the authors argue at this level.They quote scripture to show, that the Bible condems racism and treats women and men equal, but there are other quotations in the Bible which claim the opposite.Maybe the book gives additional 'arguments' to a devout Christian, but it is simply to flawed and too simplistic to convince anybody else."
5,Flower Earring Jacket,A pretty way to dress up any stud earring! I like them with my diamond and pearl studs. I also felt they were a good value.
4,Great Soundtrack,This is a great soundtrack with alot of great songs.Former Child Star By Leif Garrett turns out to be one of my favorite songs of the soundtrack.Definitely worth buying.
3,Dickie Robert's is guilty. Chris Cross isn't on the CD. Book him.,"If there's one thing I can't stand more it's when the signature song of a movie is left out of the soundtrack. This happens way too often. Why? I suspect it has something to do with big business. The Man is always ruining things for US. Thanks to the movie, though, for reminding me of this great classic song. Would've been a classic soundtrack too. Oh well. 'Flagpole Sitta' is a great song and the rest of the album is above average. 3 stars."
4,Why haven't more people heard of this group?,"All the tunes on this CD rock, I play them on my campus radio show every week. My favorites are ""When love is not around"" and ""Long night"". I don't understand why more people don't listen to East of Eden--give 'em love!"
2,Poor glue for hot melt arrow insert installs,"I had high hopes for this glue, but it was disappointing. Its melting point is too high for standard hot melt pots and even with fast hands, it's impossible to get an insert installed before it dries."
5,Brutal Reality with streaks of humor painted in,"This grim, true biographical WWII story is a picture painted with pain, sacrifice yet - the relentless humor of an honest man. Any proud Vet or any individual wanting to understand the horrors of war would not be able to put this book down. A great gift!Follow Sydney as he travels across continents battling the enemy so brave, yet scared and confused why this is all happening. You will actually feel like you are `there'. I was captivated by the stories and progress of the savage, never-ending days, yet broke into laughter by the politics of the groups, regardless of nationality. Contrast thedevastation and deadly battles to the internal-fighting yet devotion amongst Sydney's own troops!Human nature is timeless and so is this quick-read, slice of life."
2,Anyone Can Whistle,"This is a Sondheim flop, and rightfully so. Some voice are ok, the lyrics aren't bad, and the orchestrations can be nice, but overall its just boring. Dull. Unfinished. Another problem with this recording is you need the synopsis to tell you what the heck is going on because none of these really seem to go together. For Sondheim fans I would suggest NOT getting this and saving yourself the depressing bore that he produced here. If your a new listener of Broadway DON'T get this. If you like the transition between new and old Broadway this might be your cup of tea. This CD should only be bought by collectors and older-style fans. (But I'm not sure even they will like it!) Sorry Sondheim, but tow stars is generous for this. Favorite song: ""Anyone Can Whistle"""
3,Few Good Songs,"I am a BIG Sondheim fan, yet this CD does not really cut it for me. There are a couple of great songs that Sondheim wrote for this show and one of them, ""Everybody Says Don't"" was not very good on this recording. The man who sung it did not have a great voice and that really disappointed me. There are so many better Sondheim works and I would not get this one."
5,"A Substantial Book, NOT FLUFF like many relationship books!","It seems that a lot of books on relationship let you ""feel good"" by seeing how others may have it worse than you! They feel good to read but the half-life of those feelings aren't long. By contrast, this book forces you to look more deeply at yourself, at your childhood and family roots, and at how YOU have contributed to relationship patterns over the years. I learned a lot about myself -- not all things that make me feel good right now, but I think it will help more next time around."
5,I can see clearer know !,"Excellent Book !! This book was a gift for myself, and I am amazed at the extensive analysis of anxiously attached people, that it provides. I have a clearer view know as to why I behave like I behave in relationships, as well as why I tend to choose the partners I have chosen. It's all a cycle. It was a long read, but it's really, really worth it. All the examples of other people's experiences that are described in the book, were real eye openers. I am hoping this is a good step to start changing my behavioral patterns."
5,Enlightening!,"This book was very helpful to me. I was in a very abusive relationship, and it was very helpful to know how to overcome being insecure, so I could move on and live my life to the fullest. I would recommend this book for anyone who needs to know what they're so insecure about, and also about whats going wrong in your relationship. It is very helpful--take it from someone who now isn't insecure about themselves, and can love people once again."
5,trust in your relationship and each other again,"Just when I thought I could trust no more and our relationship was over along came a recommendation to read this book. It has taught us the important question, Why do people mistrust in relationships allowing them to feel so insecure. This book has allowed us to understand this important question and brought us to a whole new understanding about why we became so insecure and how we could trust in each other and ourselves again. A must for any couple!!"
5,"You Can Do It honey, ditch that zero and get you a hero!","Everyone has a point in their life where they realize they are dependent and they feel insecure about their relationships. This book has taught me to believe in my self and to trust my lover. It gives good examples that you can relate to, of other relationships and the struggles endour. You don't feel so in the dark anymore, there is help and you are normal."
2,Cases Without Real Solutions!,My review is ditto to Crystal's and Ellie's reviews--not enough information about overcoming one's own psychological problems that lead to unhealthy relationship attachments and possessiveness.
2,"Good analysis, but Depressing","This book is very good at analyzing and seeing problems everywhere. But with no solutions to hand, it leaves one feeling rather depressed. It's good to know that there are MANY people who have such issues, indeed, there are so many case studies in this book it sounds like the whole world has the same problem!! So, the boat is massive. Still, it is heavy duty and heavy going, and with no suggestions in sight, and I would give this a miss. Try something a bit more uplifting."
1,What a waste,"I was sooooo disappointed. I had high expectations for this book and found that it was really nothing more then stories told from a counselors chair. This book told me nothing about how to overcome the problems, but instead focused on experiments conducted to account for jealous partners. Truly a waste...there are other books out there that are much more useful."
1,Unnecessary,"This self-help book seems to have been written for the person who just doesn't understand that to receive, you gotta give.A partner in a relationship needs to treat his/her partner as if that person is more important than him/herself. And if one of the partners doesn't do that, find another partner. If you need to know more than that, perhaps this book can help. Then again, perhaps it could confuse you.An unnecessary book which seems to tout it's own worthiness.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review."
1,Only if you are a freak!,"So I am totally confident, and had a secure relationship. So I thought. Soon enough he was gawking at other women. And right before our ""marriage"" I found out his obsession to porn. Oh, did I say that he told me ""you do it for me"" yet he never got off with me? That he got off 1-2X a day with his beloved magazines?I have a problem with a man with issues. I do not have issues.If you are sound, but your partner is doing you in, do not get this book. It is for the 'freaks,' the people who can't handle true love, who cannot communicate, who cannot be their true selves."
4,Good Italian Mob History Book,"I had to read this for a college class I took called The History of Urban Crime..This is a good book to get the general overview about the Italian Mafia...Black Hand gang was kind of a form of terrorism back then....""He is a friend of ours""...Hhehehehe....I like cover picture also...There are better, more thorough mob history books out there..But this would be a good one to start with"
4,The Birth of Italian Organized Crime,"This book is an overview of the history of organized crime in the Italian community and gives the reader a good overview of the development of and the major players in the Mafia. While in parts it can seem like an endless list of names and crimes it does a good job of tracking the different illegal enterprises. As it turns out organized crime was not as organized as hollywood and the press would have you believe and there was qhite a bit of regional variation in what ventures were undertaken and how free the mob was to do what it pleased. Not surprisingly in most places where the Italian American community was not the dominant white ethnic group it had to work with crooked politicians, police and even other ethnic games especially the Irish and Jews. Overall this is a good overview of the Mob and for the most part does a good job of giving an account of the Mob lifestyle without glorifying it."
3,Doesn't quite connect,"In theory, there's a lot to like here. Joe Pernice is a clever melodic songwriter with a great line in sophisticated 60's pop. ""Our Time Has Passed"" has the wistful tone of a great lost Zombies single.For some reason, though, I admire this stuff more than I really enjoy it. There's a self-conscious ""excellence"" about it, it doesn't open up and breathe. I find the same thing with the Scud Mountain Boys, Pernice's earlier band.Maybe I'll put this CD on in a few years time and love it. Just needs some time in the cellar."
2,Eh.,"Not bad, but not particularly amazing either.The songs don't really distinguish themselves from each other, and Pernice's voice is way too mannered."
3,"dare to write hooks, mr pernice","lovely melodies, dense beautiful arrangements - NO HOOKS. is it a failure of nerve or can he not write them or sing them or would it be pandering to have big, fat delicious choruses that stick in your head? let's make believe for a moment that it doesn't matter (though really it does) that these are undistingushed awv's (average white voices)- what's going to make any of these songs take off? quirky bridges (i do like the quirky bridges)? melodies seem to come easily to mr. pernice. that is not the same thing as songwriting. mr pernice's songwriting heroes would never have released records with such tepid choruses. please mr. pernice, fewer releases and more time spent on songcraft."
5,A Perfect 'World',"Like just about every other band once lumped into the alt.country genre, Massachusetts' Pernice Brothers leans a lot more these days on alt than it does on country, fashioning a new category of cocktail-lounge lush but not unsophisticated pop. Joe Pernice's breathy croon recalls Colin Blunstone at his sexiest, and his songs - which are often decorated with strummy guitars, heavenly harmonies and strings that add texture not glop - do not shy away from prettiness. Whether it's in a wry turn of phrase or in a nifty guitar lick (check the buzzy runs throughout ""Let That Show""), every single one of these tracks has a most definable hook, their gorgeous melodies wafting over you like a welcome cool breeze on a sweltering summer afternoon. Frankly, listening to ""The World Won't End,"" I am overcome by happiness."
4,"Lush, relaxed pop record","This is a meticulously arranged and recorded, consistently strong collection of tuneful pop songs. Almost all of these songs deserve repeated listenings. My only criticism lies with the unvarying soft breathy vocal technique, and similarity of tempo and structure. A little variation might enhance the material. On the other hand, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Minor criticisms aside, this is still one of the best releases of 2001."
2,Not very useful,"I bought this book in hopes that I could learn a bit more about opportunites for freelance writers. However, what I have read so far was not very helpful. The information is very simple, and the book was filled with more anecdotes and examples of already published writers, making it seem at parts more biographical than informational. I was disappointed with the amount of personal stories about writers that overtook the book. One good thing about the book was that it suggested some helpful sources, but as a source itself, it did not do me much good."
1,Misleading Title,"This product is NOT a CD. The three reviews of the product on the Amazon website review the CD not the songbook and leads the reader to believe that he/she is purchasing a CD of the show. The songs listed, album cover and the reviews all indicate that the product is a CD. It should be clearly stated that this is a songbook and not a CD of the Original Broadway cast."
2,Sizing is WRONG,My daughter has barely size 10 feet so thought Size 10-11 would be perfect. NOPE. Her feet hung off by half inch. The 10-11 would be a 8-9 if it was lucky. Gave the sandals 2 stars as they are really pretty - size not so pretty.
3,Two out of three's not bad.,"The pliers work well for pressing the case back onto the case and the padded face is mar free. The adjustable crystal remover works fine just don't plan on reusing the crystal again it leaves an impression to say the least! The crystal holder is an added afterthought and should have been left out because the quality is not up to the quality of the other pieces, one of the rivets came out on first use."
3,Question about Bakery Cooking,"There is a recipe on page 56 called ""90-Minute Cinnamon Rolls"". The instructions in paragraph 3 state ""Place muffin pan on baking sheet over a shallow pan half-filled with boiling water."" Do I keep the water boiling for the 20 minutes? Thanks."
2,Moderately interesting,"While I would not go as far in criticising this book as one previous reviewer, I do question why the author wrote the book. It does provide a useful summary of the basics. But that is exactly the danger, it only describes the basics and does not indicate how you go beyond the basics. The problem is that risk management is too important and too complicated to be left to beginners. The danger is that someone could read this book and be left with the impression that they understood risk management. There is so much more that is not covered here and very little guidance on how to find it. I am sure that beginners will love this book, it makes it all seem so easy. The only problem is that it is not all so easy and many topics skimmed over in this book e.g. operational risk need much more attention than this book provides."
3,Nice Overview,It was a nice overview of some existing models but it lacked the drill down needed for the next step. I did not find that it allowed you to handle actual data.
2,It's live action alright,"but the action, horror or sex-wise, is not very lively. Very disapointed in this tame and uninteresting low-budget exploitation flick. The gore, special effects are minimal and so is the nudity and sex. The greenish cover with the girl on all fours with tentalces around her is arguably the most exploitive thing about the entire film. There are some cute Japanese girls and a scene or two of note maybe, but that just means it's worth a rental at best. With a poor film and no major extras, a purchase is not recommended. For something a little more explicit, gruesome, and weird, try Entrails of a Beautiful Woman, if you can stomach it that is. As for Angel of Darkness(#1), I say skip it and save your money, time, and energy.Note: I don't know if the rest in the series are as bad, as the first one was poor enough to make me not bother with the others."
3,Japanese exploitation.,"Those familiar with Japanese soft-porn will fell right at home with this unexceptional title. Those whom are uninitiated will be caught a bit off guard.At a high school in Tokyo, several of the female students have been moon-lighting as prostitutes. A teacher catches onto this fact and goes about putting an end to it. Things go awry when he discovers he turns into a sex demon with tentacles whenever he gets aroused (huh?). He turns from savior to vilifier, poor prostitute school girls.There are some deaths, but no blood or gore. The sex scenes are a mixed bag; some are pretty good, others are short and uninteresting. There is nudity aplenty and the material is definitely on the odd side, but fans of the anime will find it too tame to warrant continued interest.Better if you aren't familiar with the genre.6/10"
2,Needs better lyrics,"Now this song starts out ok, but it gets worse as it goes on. The lyrics need some work. The music is good, but buying it is not worth it!"
5,One of the Best,This album was the best. Christina has the most amazing voice and this song just makes it so much better. I don't think I've met one person whho doesn't like the way she sings in this album. She's great.(Better than Brittney Sprears)!
5,Christina is the best.,"I think Christina is the best new artist out there. This song is one of many that proves it. If you don't believe it, you haven't heard it. Once you hear it, you will believe it.¡Christina!"
1,Nobody Rub The Bottle- Don't Let Her Loose,"What can I say? This song sucks. Usually I like songs with this style, and I'm not a rapper, either. I like Britney Spears and all them. But I just got sick of her whine as quick as you get sick from swallowing too many prescribed pills. I liked her at first, but she was so boring. Oh, and all her other songs suck too. Put your money towards an artist that puts effort into the CD. They deserve it more. Christi doesn't."
2,Title Does Not Reflect Content,"I bought this book thinking that it would be about drawing the anatomy of the human figure in perspective--I mean the title is Anatomy and Perspective: The Fundamentals of Figure Drawing. But I was wrong! It mainly covered anatomy and barely touched on the topic of drawing the figure in perspective. So buyer beware. Yes, there is some material on visualizing body parts as slices, but no solid principles or processes for drawing the human figure in perspective. If you are looking for a book that covers anatomy, perspective, and figure drawing, there is no better book than Andrew Loomis' ""Figure Drawing for All It's Worth"".No, it's not a 1-star book. There is some interesting information on anatomy, but nothing that isn't covered in more depth in other anatomy books or in Loomis. Thus, 2-stars."
5,This is the BIBLE for life.,If you want to discover yourself and live a conscious life this is the book...It is my bible and Dr. Harville Hendrix is a household name in my home.
3,Just the work...,"Please keep in mind that this is just the workbook. I thought I could get away with just getting this and not the actual book... You need both! The workbook references the book a lot. I thought it was both. Anyway, this is a GREAT READ! Very helpful."
1,Must have the book to go w/ this book.,I am only writing this to warn others you'll need the other book to be able to use this workbook. I don't have the other book so I have not been able to use any of the workbook.
3,What are they selling?,"Three pictures are show. Are all three available for the price. Are the cartridges manufactured by Brother? Or are they new compatible unite, remanufactured, or reconditioned? The buyer may get a surprise."
2,Cool Shirt..but...,"I bought this off Shirt off Old Glory.com and when i got it, everything looked fine. But when i put it on, i realized one sleeve was like 2 inches longer than the other....what the f***? I mean, don't get me wrong, this is a super-tight shirt. but tuff gong needs to get people that aren't stoned off there asses to make their shirts!"
5,"Lush, absolutely lush","This is an album to get totally lost in. You hear a couple of technical flaws, are about to be distracted, and then appreciate it more...almost like live. My high school age daughter swiped my first copy, then my wife swiped the replacement. I bought two more...never know who else will hear it for the first time and go after it :-)"
5,Back to the Belknap,Don and Susan Sanders have captured the essence of the drive-in movie theatre and packed all of the magic into a really great book. I flipped hamburgers at the now defunct Belknap Drive-in when I was in high school and turning the pages of this time-machine brought back many memories. Forget about multiplex cinemas and theater complexes at the mall. The American Drive-In movie theatre lives!
2,"If you like Pop, then pop on down to the store and get this!","This CD is a compilation of pop hits that may be a few years old, but still can be heard on the Top 40 radio stations today, you know, the ones they play over and over again. It is all here on one CD for your convenience!"
4,Not a bad compilation CD,"I know it doesn't have any hard rock bands, but I otherwise find this CD enjoyable. This is the kind of rock and pop that is good for just hanging out, but not banging your head to.The thing is, there were many songs I didn't know about before, but that made the CD more exciting to purchase.If you haven't gotten any of the songs on other compilation CDs yet, this one's worth a few bucks. It beats all the other CDs that have the same songs on them(Jesus Jones, for example)."
2,YUP YUP,"This compilation is alright, if you like your 'hits' 3 to 4 years old. But if you want new tracks, like Britney Spears(GRRR), Cher(blah), Offspring(?) and more, go the the 'search' field and look up ""NOW 73"""
4,GREAT POOL,"THIS IS A GREAT POOL BUT THE PUMP REALLY DOES NOTHING, PURCHASED A HAYWARD PUMP MOTOR COMBO ND PURCHASED A AQUA CRITTER CLEANED AND THE POOL MAINTAINS GREAT."
5,Amazing.,"To start, my girlfriend is slightly allergic to latex. After using another straight-up latex condom, she had the same slight irritation that she said she normally got, but that didn't happen with these. They also don't carry the same strong latex smell that has plagued other condoms I've used. They're moderately sized, thin enough to leave some good feeling but still strong enough to not break.Overall a winner in both of our books, especially at the price. I just came back for a hundred more."
2,Not what I expected :(,"These condoms were not the right size for me. I had read several reviews saying that they were tight enough to be considered ""snugger fit"" condoms, but they seemed to be just as loose on me as regular Trojans. Basically, these did not meet my expectations. The condoms tended to unroll and become baggy during use. I have had a much better experience with the Iron Grip condoms.In addition, I do not like the ""sheerlon"" material in the Beyond Seven condoms. It tends to dry out much more easily than plain latex. I have also read people complaining that these condoms break too easily, but I did not run into that issue. The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that the condoms did not break and technically did what they were supposed to do.Now... what to do with the 90-odd Beyond Seven condoms I have left? Balloon animals perhaps?"
2,Beyond Seven Gone Downhill?,"I swear by Crown, Beyond Seven, and Kimono condoms. While restocking, I found a great deal here on Amazon. The picture shows ""Made in Japan,"" as they always were but my batch were made in Thailand. had I known these condoms were of lower grade, I would have gone with Kimono condoms. There is a distinct difference between the Thailand vs Japan versions. I've learned the same of Crown, so buyer beware."
5,Nice condoms,"It's the same as the Crown's that I reviewed. They are good condoms with lubricant. I haven't had any problem with it. Just a notice that if you are a big and tall guy, these may not fit you well."
4,prodotto buono,"Il prodotto è buono e molto confortevole, non da problemi a nessuno dei due.da comprare! L'imballaggio è semplice ma efficace nemmeno un prodotto si è rotto."
4,Good starting place,"This was a very good book, expecially for begining vampire fanatics. Many of the basics are here, including suggestions for futher reading, in novels at least. The pictures are great. The Countess Bathory part is not accurate, and the Vlad Dracula part isn't wholly accurate either. Don't use this as your only guide. This is really a good place to start, and the pictures in them selves are worth it."
3,"Good album, but not as good as the first","I absolutely loved 4Runner's first album, so I couldn't wait for this one to arrive in my mailbox. The first album I give at least 4 out of 5 stars on every song, but I can't say the same about Getaway Car. Of course, I think it would be very difficult to compare any album with the first, but this may sum it up... The song House At The End Of The Road is on both albums, and the first is a much better production with better background music. I give 3 out of 5 stars for Getaway Car and 5+ stars for their debut album. The best song on this album may compare to the average song on the other."
3,Hm,"Didnt really see a result, but it did raise my estrogen levels which was an upside to everything. It probably would have worked if I continued taking the pills as frequently for a few more months."
4,The Angelic Avengers,Even though this book has a flowery writing style - I found it very entertaining! Certainly way ahead of its time! To be surprised along the way when you read a passage is rare in any book. Maybe some of the charm comes because you don't suspect it to be shocking or unusual given the staid writing approach so prim and proper. I found this book in a decorator's staged library! I have to say it was quite a find.
5,Old book came as promised,"I wanted the book by Izak Denesen, written under pseudoname, for my collection. Got what I wanted. Condition adequate, as promised. Arrived timely, as promised. Great service."
5,Definite potential here,"I happened to hear this song on the radio and looked it up right away on amazon. Too bad this is only a single! I'm excited to see what Ryan puts out on his full length album. If you are a fan of Joe, Boyz II Men, R Kelly, or just r&b in general, you will surely love this single. The harmony, Ryan's voice, and the ambience create the perfect combination for an r&b classic. Be sure to check it out!"
4,An Interesting Read,This book gives a very concise view of the different religions out there in the world. It steps into a brief explanation of the religions in the world. This book gives a good dipiction of the different religions and it helped me understand the way religion is reflected upon others. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about other religions and a little bit more about themselves.
4,good collection,"With the exception of ""Stone Love"" the hits seem to be covered in this collection. The remixed version of ""Celebration"" is awful; the inclusion of it instead of ""Stone Love"" is a travesty.As is often the case on these collections, you get the butchered ""single"" version of some songs instead of the album version. Unfortunately, on this disk ""Too Hot"" and ""Ladies Night"" are definitely the butchered versions. There may be others; those two I'm sure about.The liner notes include a six paragraph bio of the band and the song listings give the highest billboard chart position for each song, and the album from which the song was taken.A good collection from one of the few successful disco groups that wasn't driven to Europe when disco died in the U.S. Four stars instead of five because of the ""Celebration"" travesty."
5,The very best of the Kool & the Gang,"I listened to all this content of the CD's. Its better than othe Disco funky CDs I Bought. My teenager likes ""celebration"", ""fresh"", ""ladies Night"", ""In the Heart"", ""joanna"", ""tonight"", ""Take it to the Top"", ""Hi de hi""' ""big Fun"", ""Victory"", we just keep dancing with the steps OVER AND OVER again. My friend asked me to play this music in the group in one of the event.Well, I was not able to play this CD, I knew its gonna get lost pretty soon and this CD is worth a billion than Queen Elizabeth of England possess....."
3,italy tax,"I had not realized that by buying these 2 cd, I would have had to pay more tax in Italian. Patience. Bye!"
5,Kool & The Gang!,"A great collection which I play often; good sound quality. It also has my all-time favorite song on there, which is why I purchased the CD."
3,MÚSICA DISCO DE LOS `70,"Música disco, que me hace recordar a mi época adolescente. Buena para alegrar una reunión de amigos, y para rememorar viejos tiempos. Musicalmente, se trata de un género atrayente, que invita a bailar y disfrutar, y de poco vuelo. Pero.... sobre gustos no hay nada escrito. La recopilación abarca grandes éxitos muy escuchados en su época, que va a satisfacer tanto a los amantes del género como a aquellos nostálgicos como yo."
5,Kool & the Gang is great.,This is the very best of Kool & the Gang. It has a lot of songs and all are great.
5,A full tilt boggie ride!,"This collection by Cool and the Gang will turn your everyday living room into a funky disco tech. Immediately, as my wife and I were jamming out to tracks like Fresh, Misled, and Take It To the Top,we both were transported back to the time when roller skating on Saturday nights was so cool and so fun. This collection of hits by Cool and the Gang is a full tilt boggie ride for those of us who still love the way disco makes us move and feel. Treat yourself and buy this funky collection of hits. You won't be sorry. Enjoy!"
2,Might have been a copy,Really poor quality Blue Ray I was so disappointed in the quality. But I got it for 4 dollars nit worth returning.
5,Fantastic,"I feel this is a wonderful book, my daughter, now 4 loves to here this story which is all about her. I original purchased this book in a bookstore, but I can't find any personalized books in the bookstores. This is a great book and I recommend parents to purchse is for their children to have many years of memorys."
1,Ridiculous,I came to this listing after doing a search for this book after being to the author's site which offers the book as a PDF for $12.50. So this is definitely a ripoff.
5,A peaceful and relaxing Christmas CD,The melodies are familiar and the harp makes them feel even more special. Great mood music.
5,Christmas Harp,Very nice! I love harp music and this one did not disappoint. I plan to buy Christmas Harp II in the very near future and I expect I will enjoy it just as much.
4,great item,this really is a cool screwpull eventough it is a bit too heavy and a little too expensive.
2,OK Lounge Music - sans excitemet...,"Compilation CD's are difficult to assemble - period. They reflect the various tastes and various acts. 'Total Lounge' is a difficult CD to both listen and watch with its accompanying DVD. The concept was decent, yet the compilation must have bounced through 10+ producers before it was even made.The beats are rather sterile and lack warmth. Moby's dithering 'Wispering Wind' shows why he's losing stock with regurgitated beats that even a high schooler could produce off of PC software. The annoying 'Me and Yoko Ono' by Tosca feat. Anna Clementi bent my ears while Radiophonic's 'Desert Wind' dragged on and on.France & Dom's ""Scam' and Leggo Beast's 'Noodle Soup' are the few exciting cuts from this drab, over-analyzed, and ultimately dull CD.Hopefully, producer Water Music Records next attempt will forgo the complacent music syndrome and add some much needed excitement."
5,Through These Eyes,"An excellent memoir that shares the difficulties of what life was like during the Great Depression and the affect that it had on millions of adolescents in the United States during the 1930's. Sgt. Hutchinson then describes the traumatic experiences for these young men in the air war in Europe and the R and R in London, England. This book is a must read for the young people of today to gain an appreciation for the accomplishments of the ""Greatest Generation."""
2,"useful for some purposes, but limited in key ways","The Kindle edition of this work suffers two major limitations. First, there is no way of quickly going to the entry of a word in the dictionary. For example, if you want to find out what ""Now"" is in Arabic, the only way to get to the entry is to use Kindle's Find function, and to skip through every use of the word ""now"" in the text until you come to the entry. This renders the dictionary impractical in many uses. Secondly, the Arabic is not given in Arabic script, but in transliteration only. This makes it of very limited use if you are learning the Arabic alphabet as part of learning Arabic."
2,Learning Lebanese Arabic,This dictionary is useful but limited in utility if you want to learn Lebanese. It does not cover many words used in the Lebanese dialect of Arabic. It makes specific references to Syrian and Egyptian words but not Lebanese.
1,Unbelievably Poor,"After one season, the blower will not start. I contacted MTD (owners of Troy-Bilt) and was basically told that it was not their problem. Absurd. Do not purchase this product, and carefully consider buying any MTD products that may need repair."
2,troyi bilt engines not what they use to be,This blower can push the leaves I have never used it as a vacum (how many leaves can you get in one bag?) I have owned a number of TB products over the last 10 years... the chain saw (ca. 2005) has been rough to start but can bring down the wood.... I give it a thumbs up (its not a stihl) ... but the weed eater and leaf blower (ca 2006 and 2008) have got problems with the carb and can be very hard to start after a few hours of use. my blower is in pieces right now as I try to get the spark back ( I really think this is the core issue with these later models... a weak spark module)I have also experienced what I thought was an over heating issue on the blower and maybe the weed cutter.. but can't prove it.I overall agree with the earlier comment that you spend a little more and get better from other manufactures (keep in mind MTD makes a lot of everything.)
2,Dont bother buying...,this is one of those items that you should just pony up and buy a good backpack blower.You can buy a more powerful easy to use blower for a small price increase.This unit started great for the first year and then was not cooperative the next.Its awkward to hold and heavy after a very short period of time.then throttle switch does not set and will move gradually to slow down the motor.Pass on this one...its the equivilent of an electric blower.
1,Buyer Beware,"Sometimes, you can get a good quality DVD in this one's price range. Not in this case. This looks like a VHS dubbed to DVD, by some company called Platinum. Disk appears burned, not pressed."
2,Ambivalent,"The film was originally released on Video, and the DVD is of excellent sound and image quality. Unfortunately, the DVD has an entire episode missing, namely the scene in The Garden, in which Satan talks with EVE.Uncertain if this is because the Master has it missing or if it has been censored in the States."
2,Good schlock but still schlock,If you are a fan of Diane Franklin then this movie is definitely a must have. Other than that there is not much to recommend this movie. Robert Morley is in this movie but is under-utilized. The movie does not age well & it is obvious that this is a 1980s pulp movie.
3,Young,"I saw this Movie when I was 12 when it came on to HBO I remembered it being very erotic at that age. I bought it and loved it. If you Liked Better Off Dead you would love this. Monique The French girl.. She, well lets say bears it all."
2,Long winded,"I got the point of the book but I found it boring and long-winded. Every chapter was basically the same thing with a little difference to move the story along. Tyler has issues: got that in chapter one, Sterling is a little crazy: got that when he first showed up and Miles wants more: you could tell that in the first scene that he shows up in.At no point in the book was I ever surprised and so involved in the book that I coulnd't think of anything else. It was a very mild read and I only finished it-- God knows that was hard enough-- because I started it and there was nothing else for me to do.all in all I don't think I'll be reading another Donna Hill book."
4,"""This Was A Good Book""","This book was not what I expected in terms of Tyler, Sterling, Miles and Lauren. The couple who I thought would get together didn't and vice-versa. Nana Tess and Wesley were the topping on the cake. The storyline was a page-turner and the ending made me smile."
2,Ehh...whatever,"Bought these hoping for better fuel efficiency. After much hyperbole, concluded that the really old spark plugs I was using delivered better milage regapped than these! What's that all about?Car: 1992 Nissan SentraI know the first thing you will think is: you put them in the wrong car. Well, not according to Bosch. They worked, just fine. I just got the same or worse mileage when doing so."
3,mmm .....,mmm ... wellI feel increase power but not really a gas consumption improvementIt is ok for the price but nothing expectacular
5,Run great,"I put this on mi Toyota Land Cruise 1996 and run great, no additional calibration, only remove existing and fix this."
5,Bosch 4501 Spark Plugs,Great value and arrived safe and sound. Saved $$$ compared to off shelf price locally.Product matched what was ordered.Thank you.
5,Bosch plugs,Bosch plugs are engineered well with rolled threads and are made using very good materials. They do not foul out even if the engine is running rich on gas. They last a long time and are dependable. I put these plugs in my kick start only Harley Shovelhead engine and it starts easy. Bosch is the only brand spark plug i ever buy now and i have tried them all.
2,will not fit a legacy gt,"this is an excellent spark plug. Bosch does great on all of their products and they do not let down on their spark plugs. I have always used their spark plugs before and never had a problem. However! Contrary to amazon's part finder and Bosch's websites claim, these WILL NOT fit a 05-09 Subaru Legacy GT. these are a great option if you have a SOHC Subaru. if you are lucky enough to have a DOHC turbocharged Subaru these are not the plugs for you! The plug reach is about 1/2"" too short. the spark will not make it into the combustion chamber! the only option for you is NGK IR.wish i would've know this before i had all the coil packs off. hope this helps someone avoid the extra work of changing your plugs repeatedly."
3,Not Ideal for Integra,"You are not allowed to gap these spark plugs, which makes it difficult to make 100% that they are fit for your car. In my case, these plugs did actually give better mileage somehow, but I don't think that is as important as making sure you car runs SMOOTHLY (rough idle) and correctly. I went with NGK spark plugs the day after I put these in and the idle is perfect in addition to starting up quick. Fuel efficiency isn't quiet as good, but it may be my driving style.Bosch is... ""okay"" but not recommended for Integras."
1,"Discontinued, faulty plugs","One of six plugs failed on my '96 Ranger 4x4. Plug failed after less than 15K miles. I made an error thinking there was no way the plug failed and did hours of testing and replacing other components first. Went to AUTOZONE for a replacement and they concluded the Platinum ""Fusion"" was discontinued. I purchased it less than a year ago. I bought another BOSCH Platinum 4 and truck runs great!"
1,"Sent the wrong items, The wrong plugs for a 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 5.7 Hemi So now what do I do with 16 expensive spark plugs...?","Sent the wrong items, The wrong plugs for a 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 5.7 Hemi. So now what do I do with 16 expensive spark plugs...?"
2,I woudn't buy these again,"Buy something more standard. The 4 electrode thing doesn't help at all for fuel economy or power. It may even make them worse. You can't gap these plugs and the wire that the spark comes out of is very small. One of the 4 plugs didn't work correctly. My car ran then when I tried to start it a second time, it wouldn't run anymore. I ended up having to find which plug was bad and replace it with one of the old ones. I'm nervous that the other 3 are going to randomly stop working. You are better off buying 99cent plugs at walmart."
1,IR4 = Gimmick @ Best,"I waited to purchase these plugs over traditional single prong plugs because of the added expense. I put them in a 2007 Honda Pilot V6 with 85K miles on it. Immediately, during the First drive, the car had less power. After 1 week of calculating fuel mileage, I noticed 2-3 fewer mpg.I took them out and returned them to the W-Mart. Satisfaction guaranteed, right? I got the OEM NGKs on amazon.com for a good price and went back to stock. The car's back to normal. Powerful in the top end, OEM mpg. Satisfied!!!The Bosch IR4s left me feeling that I had been duped by a sales gimmick."
1,Amazon Limits Order qnty to 5,"Bosch (4501) FGR8DQI Platinum IR Fusion Spark Plug, Pack of 1AMAZON LIMITS ORDER QNTY TO ONLY 5 PER ACCOUNT. THIS DOES NOT HELP THOSE WITH 6 OR 8 CYLINDER ENGINES"
5,best Koi food,started buying this food when our butterfly Koi were just youngsters. this is the only food they have ever had.now they are 12 inches and will eat out of our hand.Ken
4,biofreeze is great,My wife swears by bio freeze. Bad knees and this product seems to help a lot. Bought from a DR. and spent 20.00 from amazon 8.00 dollars.
5,The best topical pain releiver...,"I have tried this in physical therapy and wondered where to get this. So glad Amazon has it, it helps with muscle pain and goes deep to the bone. Just a little at a time to take the edge off from an external injury, or strain."
2,Does not work for trigger finger,"After reading rave reviews, I ordered. This product provided 0% relief from my hand pain. I would not recommend this product."
4,it helps!,this product really does seem to relieve aching and soreness. the sevrice getting it was good and faster than expected. the price is better than anywhere else i looked.
3,not any better than cheaper products,"Bought this product because of the reviews. Was disappointed, as didn't find it any better than any other OTC product available at cheaper prices."
5,Long time user.,"Been using this product for years. Any muscle pain, knees, neck, shoulders, etc. and you just need to use a small amount. Great product! I have neighbors that I recommended this to and they buy the spray. They also swear by it."
3,"OK, But don't expect ""miracles""",I would probably rate Biofreeze as about as effective as other similar products (i.e. ICY/HOT). Nothing really spectacular.The only real pluses are that it doesn't have much of an odor and it does seem like you only have to use a little to experience the effect.
3,"Better than average, less than promise","This product, Biofreeze, surely is better than most other products I and my family have used over more than fifty years. It is easy to use and offers temporary relief. However, the promise of the product is that it has a special herbal ingredient that works almost wonders. That does not seem to be true. Overall, the product is better than average. A great alternative product, which though is smellier, is Iodex."
5,good company,very good product works fast doesn't smell to bad goes on cold turns hot really helps the soreness
1,This does NOT work!,I have osteoarthritis in both knees and this stuff does not work. My orthopedic doctor even says this stuff does not work. Maybe if you have sore muscles from working out it might help but for arthritis it's a joke.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,bio freeze,"This didn't do anything for me, does not live up to it's claim. WILL NOT purchase it again. Stinky garbage."
5,Great Pain Reliever,I would reccomend this product verses the store brands. I have MS and Firbromyalgia and this product realy helps with soreness. My Neurologist first gave me a sample and I have been using it since. Family memebers also use this and get the same result.
1,"I don't know why, I was charged $27.63 by amazon, but links to here.","I purchased from amazon, now out of stock, so was sent to this page to writ the review. Shop around, there are a lot of varied prices.BIOFREEZE has a lot of menthol and camphor, makes my eyes burn. Of course, there were no descriptions of the ingredients on here. This product causes a lot of distraction and sensation on the skin's surface, not very penetrating. I'm using it for shoulder pain (muscle & tendon). I'm unhappy that this is not returnable, because I could do better for the price. Icy hot, tiger balm, or dragon balm work better, way better.If you're experimenting, that is trying it for the first time, don't buy the big bottle thinking you're getting a good deal. spend $7-$10 on a smaller bottle or tube and try it out first."
2,Does not relieve pain,"Put it on, your skin will feel cold. The feeling is nice but dont expect thisgel to actually relieve any pain. Maybe worth trying but this didn't helpme at all tbh."
4,Good product.,It works as well or better than the usual sore muscle creams. I use it after a bad lifting session or a long run and it's better than your average sports cream.
5,Worked Great,"Good product, great price. I would recommend this product ot anyone needing relief from muscle or arthritic pain. I really does work."
5,the best!,"I got some of this from my chiropractor and she sells it at her office, but it's about 3x as much as it is here. This is great for anybody who works out of has sore muscles. Rub it on and you're good to go. Great for anybody with back and/or neck pain. If you have sore muscles or joints, definitely give it a try!"
4,BioFreeze gel,This is a good product for topical pain relief. It does not have a strong smell like similar products. The pain relief is almost immediate and seems to last a couple of hours (at least for me). I have some knee damage and it helps take the edge off of the pain.
2,Hyped,This is just menthol. It feels cool but I doubt it's doing anything other than feeling cool. The rest is a placebo effect.
4,BIOFREEZE REVIEW,"WORKS WELL ON TIRED MUSCLE AREA, ESP. SHOULDER AND BACK. PRICE IS MORE THAN COMPETITIVE WITH SIMILAR PRODUCT. OH, YES, I AM AN RN AND KNOW THIS WORKS."
4,be careful what you shop for,"I have used Biofreeze before and love it. I would recommend it to anyone with painful muscles or joints. My only problem is who I ordered it from. The picture of the product showed a tube and a bottle, so that's what I thought I was getting. But I only got the tube. I could have bought it from another vendor on Amazon cheaper."
5,Works great,Odor dissipates within 15 minutes so u can use anytime. Much better than an ice pack. Keeps your sore muscles nice and cold
5,Very good product,"I have been using Bio-Freeze for several years now, and I believe it to be a very good product, have never had any complaints for it."
4,Helps arithritic hip,This is the second time I've bought this product and use it at night for arthritis is my hip. Brought it in a smaller quantity the first time.
5,Good for Athletes,"I use BioFreeze in conjunction with Tiger Balm for injuries/pain. Just use Tiger Balm for ""soreness"", though. Good for sprains, strains, joint issues, tendon issues, etc. Smells way better than Icy Hot, in my opinion.Good price, but the seller took forever to process/ship my order. Could have just been an isolated problem and I did get the product, so I will probably purchase this way again."
5,Great product!!!,My husband has severe rheumatoid arthritis and just had surgery for spinal stenosis which means he's had to go off all his arthritis medication for several months. He has tried other products but says Biofreeze works better than any other product he's tried. We first found this product through our local physical therapy office. It was what they use on their patients. I highly recommend Biofreeze and a bottle last a long time. We are getting ready to start on our third bottle and have never regretted buying it.
2,Not as good as a common store brand from . . . wait for it . . .,"Yes, Walmart has an over the counter version of virtually the same product that is stronger, and therefore, works better. Not that any of them work as well as I wish they did. But there you go. Oh, and the Walmart version is about half the price, for now. It's called Muscle Rub, and I couldn't find it on their site but have some in the bathroom."
2,Walmart's Extra Strength Muscle Rub is much better and cheaper,"really dont understand all those glowing reviews about this product. i ran out of my usual Walmart Extra Strength Muscle Rub and thought i'd try this one for a change. first, it is more expensive. second, it dries way too fast for me to be able to massage my shoulders with it. so i need to keep adding product. the texture is very much like jelly of green color, it doesnt have a strong smell. i have pain in my shoulders and neck everyday from long working hours and walmart's rub was always great. i can massage for some time, and the scent would go away within about 15 minutes (i dont mind). the tube still lasts a long time and you can massage for as long as you like as it dries slowly (like 10 minutes). Biofreeze didnt relieve my shoulders the same way unfortunately."
2,Walmart's Extra Strength Muscle Rub is much better and cheaper,"i really dont understand all those glowing reviews about this product. i ran out of my usual Walmart Equate Extra Strength Muscle Rub and thought i'd try this one for a change. first, it is more expensive. second, it dries way too fast for me to be able to massage my shoulders with it. so i need to keep adding product. the texture is very much like jelly of green color, it doesnt have a strong smell. i have pain in my shoulders and neck everyday from long working hours and walmart's rub was always great. i can massage for some time, and the scent would go away within about 15 minutes (i dont mind). the tube still lasts a long time and you can massage for as long as you like as it dries slowly (like 10 minutes). Biofreeze didnt relieve my shoulder and neck pain the same way unfortunately.btw, the Equate one is better than Bengay because it is less greasy and doesnt cause acne pimples on the shoulders."
5,great pain relief,"My husband and I have used this for years, playing golf and getting older. Works great you will love it"
2,biofreeze,"Biofreeze worked okay for a few hours, but the smell was too much; reminding me of my high school locker room with all the football players slathering on lineament."
1,Prime Shipping Mis-Information,"I think we all know what BioFreeze is if we're ordering it. My beef is with the 'Prime 2-day shipping' that turned into a 'It's still not here yet and now it's labeled as a standard shipping option'. That tick's me off. I try to order PRIME items to rationalize my membership fee costs. If ordering from AMAZON PRIME with 2-day shipping free doesn't always apply when it's advertised as such, then what are we paying for?"
1,never received the item,i never received the item some one called saying that the post office had returned it and they would redeliver the item i never received notice from the post office letting me know that it was there. the redelivery has not occurred.i am experiencing pain and wanted to try this bio-freeze to see if it would help.i dont know what is going on but i am still waiting
1,Not happy,When I received Biofreeze Pain Relieving from shopmedicalsupply.com. the cap was on and the bottle was half.$8 for half ???
4,Provides relief,"This works great for muscle aches, but I have also tried it to relieve restless leg syndrome. About three to five minutes after application, it gives a pleasant, burning sensation that really helps to block the pain. I have tried other topical pain-relieving creams, but this one wins hands-down for effectiveness. I only wish the relief lasted longer. It seems to work best for 15-20 minutes, and then needs reapplication."
4,Biofeeze,"I'd been looking for this product locally for sometime, but no one carried it. Had used it during the Disney Marathon in 2007 and it instantly helped to ease the pain and stiffness I was experiencing after having run the half marathon the day before and after 18 miles of the marathon in very hot and humid conditions.The product is a greesless jell that doesn't seen to stain clothing. Only negative I have about the product is that it's benifits, at least for me, are short lived. Maybe 15 to 20 minutes."
3,pain reliever,Recommended highly by a family member.... it seems to work pretty well. However the verdict is still being considered. We'll try again on the next pain/ache.
5,great stuff,"I have been using this product for the past 3 years or so and it feels amazing still. I have back pain 2 or 3 times a week and havent found anything else that would make it better, it's not a perminate fix but it works when you need it to."
5,Works great for deep pain.,This has gotten my friend through a painfully shattered leg. Good for deep pain. Half the price here as buying locally.
5,Great stuff!,If U have tired and painful muscles ... be sure to purchase this product. My masseuse has been using it for years on my back & shoulders wherever there is tightness in my muscles. It WORKS! There is no smell so no need to worry about it interfering with your perfume or cologne. Glad I found it at Amazon!
3,not entirely sure,Both my daughter (40-a very experienced nurse) and I (80) have ongoing pains. Mine is in my shoulder and I may need a shot (bursitis?-but only when sleeping). Her problems are in her hands. Biofreeze seems to help both of us a bit but we need more time. I use the roll-on.
5,Great for pain!!,I use this product on my knees after my daily walks is fantastic for sore muscles I recomend this product.
5,EXCELLENT GEL FOR MUSCLE PAIN!!!!,"Excellent and penetrating gel for muscle pain very powerful, highly recommend it! Feels cold and it does work!"
5,excellent product,"I think this is the best topical product for muscle soreness and spasm! I use it ALL the time. As a matter of fact, I am almost out!"
4,great product,this product worked wonders on my back. i use it often and have recommended it to family members and friends.
4,pain relief,"I usually buy a generic muscle rub because it's cheaper. However, this is non greasy and seems to work well."
5,Relief,"Have severe arthritis in hands, feet and lower back. I get temporary relief by applying this gel to hands,feet and back. It does dry your skin somewhat, so in between I apply lotion or cream. Like I say, it is only temporary but when you are in pain even temporary relief is welcomed.Will definitely re-order when my present supply is depleted. I love the hand pump as it is so easy to just pump on my hands for application!"
5,Biofreeze your pains away,My Chiropractor used this on my back a few weeks ago and I found it helped with my pain more than anything I have ever used. Price was good and deleivery was fantastic!
5,Aliana1,Great pain relieve product. I order almost everything through Amazon.com and I am very happy with the products and shipping.
5,BioFlex,"A wonderful product. I rub it into my knees before my exercise workout, makes a big difference, no pain after the workout."
5,satisfied,excellent product! would highly recomend to anyone with muscular pain. This does not burn like other rubs and the menthol smell goes away within minutes.
5,Biofreeze,I started using Biofreeze while running marathons and I found it to be very effective.I continue to use it today.Frank McDowell
3,ENGLISH BIOFREEZE,"I purchased this Biofreeze through Amazon , Cost quite a lot because it came from USA,Why was that Amazon when I have just found out you can buy this product from BOOTS chemist off the shelf for one third the price, It does seem to give slight relieve of pain in the feet,So beware when you purchase this product , You could save buying local in the uk."
5,"great product, Biofreeze","This is the best product I have found for muscle pain. It feels icy and hot at the same time, and takes your mind off of the pain. I have recommended it to everyone who has pain."
4,BIOFREEZE Pain Relief Gel,"Biofreeze Pain Relief Gel works! I have arthritus in my back and feet. I rub Biofreeze on those areas before work, and it really helps minimize my pain. I also used Biofreeze on my feet before a recent trip to Disney World and I was able to keep up with my granddaughter with no problems!"
2,Not for severe arthritis pain,"I've been searching for a while, but I've basically given up. It seems I won't ever find something to significantly reduce my mom's arthritis pain. She's on prescription meds as well but they don't seem to do enough and can eventually damage the liver. I thought that this could be a great help after reading the reviews, but apparently it does not make much difference. It's only been 2 weeks so I will still update if it gets better. If not, the search is still on..."
3,More like icy hot,"First off, wish I had gotten a way smaller bottle. I have pretty bad back pain on and off where I cannot work out, cannot do aerobics anymore and have to be very careful what I do in the gym and at home. Yesterday I simply bent down in a squat to do something and reinjured my back that was bothering me from hours in the car. I applied heat, took some aleve and later in the day - remembered the biofreeze. I rubbed a small amount in. I didn't really feel a chill but boy does it get very hot! Maybe I'm allergic to it or something. But I almost had to wash it off it burned so much. On the other hand, it did alleviate the pain some. And this morning, pain is not too bad."
3,"nothing special , high price","BIOFREEZE IS ONE OF MANY TOPICAL PREPARATIONS IN A CATEGORY CALLED ""COUNTER-IRRITANTS"". THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT OF MOST SIGNIFICANCE IS MENTHOL. LIKE MANY OTHERS, THE CONCENTRATION IS FROM 3% TO 4%. THERE ARE MANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT SHOULD WORK THE SAME AT JUST A FRACTION OF THE COST OF BIOFREEZE. READ THE LABELS AND USE AS DIRECTED. COUNTER-IRRITANT TOPICALS ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE FOR MINOR ACHES AND PAINS. BEST WISHES!"
5,this stuff is realy good.,"I HAVE ARTHURITIS IN BOTH KNEES AND FEEL . MY KNEES AND MY HIPS WERE INJURED, I TRIED EVERYTHING. AND A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT BIOFREEZE AND TO ORDER IT ON AMAZON. SO I DID AND THE PAIN STOP.UNLESS I FOR GET TO USE IT."
4,16 Oz Biofreeze from new distributor,"We love this product and have given it excellent reviews. Have always ordered the 32oz bottle, but ran short of cash, so ordered the 16oz.The product is fine, but the cap was off and some of the product was on the filler paper in box."
4,"You won't smell so good, but you will feel better","I find the alcohol smell to be quite off putting, but after putting it on at night I feel much better in the morning. I've tried other similar products, but I find this to be much more effective."
2,Ovation CC24 celebrity accoustic guitar,"I was disappointed with this guitar for the fallowing reasons.BUZZING STRINGS, CHEAP TUNING MACHINES, and GLUE COMING UNDONE.I only owned this guitar for about 3 months before I returnedit for a better quality guitar for about the same money RE: Washburn D10 SThe good things i found about this guitar are the fallowing:comfortable fast neck, nice sound ,comfortable oval back andgreat looks.This Ovation CC24 Celebrity is A braced, has a lyrachord body,cut away for upper fret access and a mid depth bowl bodyfor great tone.The electronics aren't too bad, they are easy to fiddle with whiletrying to play.I would suggest the WASHBURN D10S. IT SELLS FOR AROUND THE SAME PRICEAS THIS FOR $350.00"
4,Great guitar,"This is a great guitar. Great onboard electronics, nice fret action, stays in tune and sounds fantastic."
3,Definitely NOT pthalate-free!,"Reasonable performance for the price, and a good size and shape, but EXTREME-ly smelly and leaches oil to the surface just sitting about. I would be very hesitant to use this device without a condom. Also this unit tends to dry out and get hard very quickly, app. 3 to 6 months so prepare to replace it frequently. I would suggest spending more for better quality."
2,Disappointing,"Over the last few years, Full Cycle has changed its sound a lot. While it was very subtle, funky, jazzy, even smooth at the beginning (for example the all time classic ""New Forms""), they have become much harder since then. However, they still produced a lot of good songs, and DJ Die was the man for the catchy melodies. Indeed, beside Roni Size, he was my favourite at Full Cycle.This CD is a disappointment, however. There are only very few really good tracks on it, and otherwise it is very repetitive and very hard. Hard is fine if you mix it up with some good tunes, but Die does not give you anytime to relax, and outside of a club, this is not so good. Maybe its a good mix if you want to give a DnB-party, but if you want to listen to it at home or whereever, it is too repetitive, almost dull.I hope his next mix is better. Until then, buy the new CD's of Hype, Marky, J Majik or Zinc."
4,Tin Fish Gourmet,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I've always been a fan of canned fish (sardines, anchovies, salmon, smoked oysters, tuna etc.) This book adds to my culinary enjoyment, by offering some tasty alternatives, to the age old stand-by recipes. Let's not forget the health benefits of eating seafood; many contain omega3 and are a great source of low fat protein."
1,mini lego at-te,"i consider this toy was too expensive for what is really is. even dough it was a mini building set, i honeslty did not expect to be soo tiny."
1,A TRAVESTY,"Listening to this disc, and then to Rachmaninoff's actual recordings on RCA (many of the same pieces), is revealing. The performer on ""A Window in Time"" is utterly unlike the real Rachmaninoff. The Stahnke Rachmaninoff plays with almost no expression on a small-sounding piano with limited dynamic range. He is metronomic and boring. The REAL Rachmaninoff performed with color, with rhythmic vitality and alertness; none of it is here. This CD is deadly computerized ennui. If you want the Rachmaninoff piano rolls, try London's ""Rachmaninoff Plays Rachmaninoff"" CD; it's done on a real concert grand. It may not be elegant, but it's alive - more than can be said for this insomnia cure."
2,Dull and lifeless,"I was very disappointed to hear this recording, after hearing Rachmaninov live on the two Naxos recordings and also hearing the recordings of the Ampico rolls on Decca.Something seems to have happened during all of the manipulation; the playing seems to have been homogenized. The rythm and tempo are no longer dynamic, and the highs and lows have been smoothed off. This is not the case with the recordings of the Ampico rolls, played back on an Ampico-equipped machine, on the Decca CD which are very dynamic and lively.The sound on this CD is beautiful, but I'm afraid I'll only use it as background noise."
2,mechanical echoes,"As a classical music buff and an amateur pianist, I eagerly purchased both volumes of ""A Window in Time"". Unfortunately, I found both albums disappointing. There is little range in touch and dynamics; for example, the virtual performer seems incapable of legato. The technical problem lies in the recording of the piano rolls. Although the rolls are ""digital"" in nature, they do not have the capability to capture nuances. What is left is some sense of Rachmaninoff's timing, but even that is suspect - in the liner notes, Stahnke mentions the problems he experienced with determining what speed at which to play the rolls. That ""impressive speed"" you hear may be artificially sped up."
5,"Buy it, cherish it--this is a must-have disc","One can only hope that Telarc keeps releasing these ""Window in Time"" discs until we hear all of the rolls Rachmaninoff made. My old piano prof said, ""Let's just get it over with, Rachmaninoff was the greatest pianist ever."" Upon hearing these discs, you will know why many people agree. The 78s don't do his playing justice. The Telarc recording of the Bosendorfer does. Pay particular attention to the Chopin. See if you can come up with adequate superlatives to describe this playing! I can't."
5,Radio,"In 1995 me an Kai had a radio show on KUBE FM (Keele University Broadcasting something or other) named after this book.I suspect Kai actually did go into the library, but only to look for expensive tomes on obscure sea animals - he came up a corker there.If you don't have the time / patience / money to read it - the mollusc did it."
1,Horrible service,"I ordered The Magic Toyshop as a gift for a friend who collects children's books. I ordered it on Dec. 9 to give as a Secret Santa gift on Dec. 19. It never arrived, and then we all went on vacation. I told her it would be coming later. NOW, I find the ordered was cancelled!!! (And, today is Jan. 3) If it wasn't in stock when I ordered it, why was it on the website? Now, I have to try and find something comparable for her and Christmas AND New Year is over!! This is the worst. I will never order from these ""off site"" booksellers again. And, Amazon should be ashamed to be affiliated with a lame operation that can't keep it's website updated. I'm through with them. NOW what am I going to do???"
4,The Money Mission,"The debut joint by the War Team is very impressive. The group has unlimited potential. The group's lyrical stylings are superb, however, the beats could use a tune up. I would recommend this CD to everyone down with hip-hop. S-One is da bomb!!!"
5,THE WORLD MEETS BARBRA STREISAD!!!!!!!!,ONCE IN A LIFETIME A VOICE COMES ALONG. STREISAND HAS THE GIFT AND SHE SHARES IT WITH US. THANK YOU GOD!
3,For Broadway lovers only,"Every thing about Barbara Streisand is great, but this album is mostly for Broadway lovers. There was no pop or easy listening music."
1,Bad Purchase!,"My daughter received this as a gift fro her 7th birthday. It can count quarters okay. But if you put in a penny, nickel, or dime, it always counts a dime. My 4 year old enjoys it, she puts pennies and nickels in it and calls it a dummy pig. I'm very disappointed in this product."
4,Does what a piggy bank should do,"I picked one of these up at the warehouse store - something of an impulse buy. We used to have a ceramic scrubbing bubble bank and it broke so we needed something to put change in. A mason jar was doing the trick but this looked cute so I got it - yes, for myself, a grown adult (probably 28 at the time...)It works. My husband finds it irritating how it vibrates and all once you put the money in but I think it's funny. Holds a good chunk of change and does what it should - it's a bank with a little extra. Despite the vibration feature, the batteries have lasted forever.I've never heard it guess wrong - thought the pink counting one my son got for his birthday does miss a few now and then.Recommend this for either a kid or an adult with a weird side."
4,prince paul is a damn foo'...,"brotha anem is skrate clownin!aint NOOOO rappin on this thang, so dont get it twisted, but if ol' dirty bastard had been a part of de la soul instead of wutang, then THIS is what his first solo album woulda sounded like.they some foos... SOME FOOS, i said!!!!"
5,Inspirational,"Kryon is a loving entity currently on earth to help us move into the next phase of a new era. These parables are stories told by Kryon and translated by Lee Carroll to show how many persons are reacting to special circumstances as we move deeper into this century and begin to receive the new gifts of God. You will not find the negativity or cynicism of some channeled entities, and no hard lessons here. This is truly an inspired and inspiring book helping you discover how to come closer to the Great Reality, which seems to some to be a fairy tale like ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."" I hope you have an opportunity to read and share this book with those you love."
2,Oh no,Well to be perfectly frank I just couldn't finish it. I had hoped to learn so more but so far I haven't. I still have the book and will give it another try on another day.
5,the parables of kryon,"a fantastic read and one i felt i can relate too story by story. a real good read and a very uplifting, feel good book...thank you Lee Carrol"
2,LACK OF FUN !,"The moment I opened this movie from the sealing I was excited!But if I would have known that in the next hour in a half I would be bored to death I should have not bought this movie.Now lets get to the basics before I get on to what I think, I should tell you to rent this first.This is not everyones anime movie.plot:was a toatal bore did not live up to expectation.bottom line:C lines:did they just fill up every space of the movie with kagome yelling INUYASHA!all the time.bottom line:Fanimation:was a toatal joy to witness animation has imporved since the first INU movie. bottom line:Avoice overs:were fabulos except that dang moneca story she does a terrible job compared to the japanese kagome yasuano yoki.Moneca brings this movie down almost all the way.bottom line:F-overall grade: I am sorry if I hurt any inu fans today but we cant just pretend to like this anime mess.bottom line:D"
1,Don't Even Bother,"I hated this movie a lot. I hate the fact that throughout the entire movie, it was all about Kagome and Inuyasha. Kagome is always shreiking on the top of her lungs: ""Inuyasha! Inuyasha!"" throughout the entire stupid movie and the one before it. There is too much drama throughout the entire thing so I recommend watching the 3rd movie since there's more action and there isn't much drama."
3,inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan. AND JESUS IS OUR SAVIOR,this was less intresting then i thought it was a very good movie but it didn't seem that there weren't enough action and i don't care to munch for the dailouge and when saw inuyasha turning into a fulldemon i thought it was gonna last for a while but all he did was stand there growling but it was a good movie.
3,It's okay,"I think it's okay. It's great compare to the first one.The story is good, it's full of surpris. I just don't really like the colour of it. I have to say I like the TV series, and movie 3 better than this one.Anyway it's good, but if you want to buy it, think carefully."
1,Ugh,"If you want to see this movie RENT IT FIRST! It was stupid, predictable, and all around a waste of time. Don't get me wrong I like Inuyasha, but this...this was too much! I don't want to give too much away. For one thing the animation was different. Everyones eyes like doubled in size, and their hair looked like wet/crimped. I mean seriously! I wish I could tell you more without giving the whole movie away. But I won't say anything else except-please take my word for it! This movie is a wet blanket! I was disappointed, shocked, and appauled. RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
5,The Beginning of The Series,"Beware the Shopping Mall was the first book out of the series written and created by Betsy Haynes. I was suprised at how Betsy Haynes can write so wonderful. In the book, there is a new mall about to open called Wonderland Mall. But there are strange rumors about the place. It seems that the mall has been built under a graveyard by mistake. And all the clerks in the mall seem a bit strange if you know what I mean by strange...Something is lookng for the girl named Robin and her friends in the mall. They must investagate the place to find the mysterious ""thing"" that's been haunting the mall. Something dead lies in the mall, and now it's up to the kids to find what it is, before IT finds them first..."
4,It's Uptown (1966) George Benson,"Like ""The George Benson Cookbook"" (1966), this is another jazz organ-guitar combo release with Lonnie Smith on organ and Ron Cuber on saxophone. Although George Benson began as a vocalist, he only sings on three tracks (""Summertime"", ""A Foggy Day"", and ""Stormy Weather""), and does a decent job. (Two out of Three ain't bad.)I like quick tempo jazz instrumentals, and I liked 80% of the eleven tracks on this album. It made sense to include these five additional bonus tracks on this album. The three alternate tracks were not as good, but interesting to hear. The last two additional tracks are from a Lonnie Smith album with the same musicians (I liked ""Minor Chant"" best). Sixteen tracks on a jazz album is a good buy.I'd recommend this to anyone who likes 1966 jazz organ-guitar combo instrumental tracks, similar to many Jimmy Smith Blue Note recordings."
2,The Jesus Mystery,"Supports my understanding of Jesus early years, affiliation of his teachings, his attire to Hinduism and Buddhism. His resurrection notion propagated by the christian church for power and political gain. His last days in Kashmir aftter surving his crucifixion. Author basically retells what Nicholas Notovich wrote in his book."
5,The best!,"I live in a cold, snowy climate and I have hard-to-fit feet. These wonderful boots come in WIDE, are warm and very light weight! Also, they are so plain and inconspicuous that you don't look as though you are wearing boots, so you can go to church or a restaurant and not look as though you came in off the ski slope. The fit is true to size with a thin, wool sock, but If you plan to wear heavy socks, I would suggest going up a size."
5,Great!!,"I bought this same boot about 10 years ago and liked the style.I was happy to see the style is still available so I decided to see if the quality is still there.Yep, it is still a great boot. I wear them every morning when I walk my dog in the woods and they keep my feet dry and warm.I would recommend this boot to anyone."
5,james semmens is my grandpa,"i have read this book and can tell he is an expert in this field. He has had an amazing professional career,from a navy doctor to an inventor, author, college professor,former OBGYN officer and lecturing around the world. His expertize should be highly credited by others I urge you to buy his books. He also has written the Kotex pamplets."
1,Stingy offerings,"My low rating isn't based on the quality of the Burns and Allen show, which is very amusing, but the skimpyness of the offerings in this set. The 5 DVD's contain only eight 30-minute shows, all evidently from 1950, and a documentary. All of this could have been included on 2 DVD's. Each DVD contains only one hour of programing."
2,Big Disappointment,"I bought this compilation as a gift for my sister who really enjoys the show. I should have known something was up based on the low price for the set, but I was extremely disappointed to see that each disc only contain 2 half hour episodes. This is an extreme waste. A 5 disc set should easily contain 20 to 25 episodes and finding out that it only contains 8 episodes and a documentary makes me feel cheated."
1,Rotten Deal,I was expecting something more than 8 episodes on 5 discs. These people are thieves. In the future I will purchase nothing without the number of episodes printed. May just go back to Walgreens. This is pitiful. At least at Walgreens I can get my money back.
1,VERY disappointing! I expected so much more!,"I should have read the reviews before ordering. This sounded like a 5-DVD collection, but it is only 8 episodes and one long documentary. What a waste! I want to see SEASONS of this show, like were broadcast on CBN Network late at night in the 1980s! The film quality was good and they were so entertaining! I know there would be a market for these shows! Why are they not available? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SET. Even ONE star is too high a rating."
2,Good but BAD,"Works fine !But my pool have dark blue tiles and ..if this AquaGlow didn't work at all !If your pool is white , might look like the picture ( doubt it !! )But it is fun to show to the guests !!"
1,Lasted 2 times,First one received was broken. Second one lasted two times and will not work anymore. Unit did not get wet on inside. When it did work it made the pool look awesome.........
2,Would like to use it....,"I've had the AquaGlow 3559 Underwater Light Starship for almost a month now and I haven't even been able to get it open to put batteries in it. Very frustrated with the fact that it seems glued together. I've tried to open it the way the directions say, I've tried other online reviews, and howto websites. Nothing.. HELP!"
1,AquaGlow 3559 Underwater Light Starship is junk,i think it is junk i used it put it back in the box went back out to swim 2 days later used it hit the button a few times to change mode and the button broke
1,This is not worth the money!!! Complete let down for party!!,I bought 3 of these and they are all broken!!!! They leak and my son dropped one and it broke. Not worth it!!! Also the picture they show is not how it works. I have a 27' round pool. That's why I bought so many. I works better as a disco ball in my kids room!
2,Jnless you're not worried about it lasting- Skip it!,"I saw mixed reviews but thought it would be fun for the pool. It does have a beautiful effect on the pool. You have to be careful though it's seals leaked some water into the bulb each time I put it in the water. There are 2 layers for the water to get to before it reaches the electronics. It got bumped by someone, not dunked, just lightly bumped into and it tipped the topside into the water.The electronics got wet and it didn't work. We let it dry out and a few weeks later tried again and it was working. The platic snaps that close and seal it are showing wear after only a few uses and I expect will break comletely after a couple more uses."
3,"Not all that I expected, but still interesting","I imagined it would be a more powerfull lightning. If you have a small pool, it will work well, but I suggest you to use more than one Aquaglow for better result."
1,Embarrassing,Bought this as a gift for a friend's birthday party. They were excited to see it in action so we put it right in the pool with about twenty guests watching. What a huge disappointment!!! Looks nothing like the picture...totally lame. It barely lit the corner of about a 20' pool. I would return it right away if it wasn't a gift.
4,Good with smaller above ground pools,"I have a 16x3 intex above ground pool and this is ""OK"" for it. I think I am going to have to invest in one more to get more of a bright effect, but it is a really cool light. It has numerous settings on it and will light up a party indeed. We used it at our bbq with a couple little torches and it was awesome. Everyone loved it. But like I said could be brighter. ALSO, my kids like to turn it on outside the pool and watch it glow on the ceiling..It IS bright up there :) Great bargain, and I would recommend, only if you have a smaller pool."
2,wasn't satisfied,"bought 2 underwater light show disco balls wasn't satisfied in what light they put out seems that they would be better in a kids pool then a intex above ground pool the picture shows that it covers pool but the one i got barely covers 12"" of pool hope to find something better"
3,"Interesting, but not bright enough","Works as advertized, but for me with a blue tile pool the light output is not sufficent to be significant, especially with other outdoor lights on. Maybe it would be fine in a white bottom pool, but I can't say for sure (only have one pool). I'd also like it if one of the modes was to turn on at dusk and then run for the hours specified, but I have to manually turn it on anytime it's to be used."
2,Not worth it personally in Hot Tub,"The item is cool but honestly, its not very easy to see the cool colors with the jets and air on in the hot tub. It tends to want to be right next to someone and it seems to always be in the way."
2,not what I expected and saw in the picture,"device included in a pool tube medium and the expected effect does not shine, do not notice the lights are very weak well I thought that it would look like the picture and it was not so in this case will be for a very small pool."
2,Keep Looking,"Interesting idea, but poor execution. Would be great for smaller pools, but anything 20'+ would need 2-3 of these to light up the pool like it's depicted in the picture. I use as a novelty from time to time but it's not practicle or really worth the money. Sorry, I'd find something else more powerful, as this runs off a couple of AA batteries only."
1,Doesn't last and not very bright,"Used less than a dozen times and the power button no longer functions.When it did, the lights weren't very bright (not at all as pictured)."
2,is what it is,Don't expect a spectacular light show. The kids enjoyed it for a while. The brilliance showed in the picture is highly exagerated. It died during the 2nd summer.
2,great for a bathtub,I must say I was very disappointed with this product. I can barely even see the lights below the starship let alone anywhere in the pool. This would be great for a bathrub but nothing bigger than that. Might have to order atleast 4 more if I want to see it in the pool.
1,These are crap,"I bought three of these, and they are junk! Our pool was just put in and job finished! I was so disappointed when I tried these. My time to return has expired and I'm very upset. Don't buy these"
2,Was hoping for the best even after negative reviews,"I had read several reviews about these lights and hoped that I may be one of the people giving them 5 stars...obviously I'm not. I bought two of these for my white inground pool, they worked properly ONE time, I put them in at night when no one was swimming, it did not rain, they were not submerged at all, the second night only one would work, by the third night, neither of them would work, After banging on the sides of one and shaking it vigorously ( my youngs sons method of working on things) one came back on, he tried the second light with his same technique, with no results. I did not expect the first night that they would light up the entire pool, the two of them did light up most of the area however, I just wish I could have enjoyed them for more than one night. I gave two stars instead of one because they were shipped quickly and did give me a few hours of enjoyment."
3,somewhat disappointed mom,Cute but not exactly what I had expected. We have a 20 ft above ground pool and I thought it would illuminate more than it does.
2,Looks dated in 2007,"It's a lovely idea to have a book honouring women designers. However, in late 2007 their homes look dated. Recommended if you want to read about successful women; no longer recommended if you want photos of fresh design ideas."
3,"No WOW factor, but still nice to look at","The designers showcased have marvelous taste, but there is nothing here that was impressive. The book is beautifully photographed, but that's about it. My suggestion-Wait until it's on clearance or borrow it from the library. C+"
1,Show me the inspiration!,"Lovely to look at, lovely to hold.... but that is about it! Whereas the photographs are masterful, there is little beyond the pictures, not even a rudimentary, cursory, or trifling insight or inspiration. One does expect something after all from a living room tome. It is truly the book that doesn't even begin to give. I am glad I purchased this book used as I would have felt used and abused to have paid full price for this creativity bypass and abyss."
5,Fabulous,This book features fabulous ideas for decoration and showcases stunning houses. It's definitely the best value in its category. Rush to get your copy
3,Can't beat it for the price,"I got this pretty cheap since it's an old item. It comes with drivers for Windows 98.Having said that, it's not too difficult to find a Vista Driver. Just Google around until you spot it.The sliding action of the base simulates arrow keys, not joystick input, so it isn't velocity sensitive. Translation: don't expect to move faster just because you moved the device quickly. Think of the device as a replacement for your keyboard instead of a secondary joystick."
5,great intro / info video,"with all of the dvd/vhs videos out there on the market, I found this one to be a great starter video for someone just getting into fly fishing or one that wants to improve their sport. while some may say that the video spends too much time on casting and tying ... well, that's the art of fishing!! If you can't cast you're not going to have too much luck in catching! If you can't tie the necessary knots, well, then you're just going to get a lot of practice in what it feels like to lose a fish (that is, if you even were able to cast the line out!!!!) All kidding aside, this is a great video and I've watched it many times over and have corrected many of the common mistakes that I have found in my casting or other techniques. Enjoy!"
5,Fly Fishing Video,"Great video. This video covers all the basics for the beginner fly fisherman. I found it helpful with casting tips, knott tying tips and the verbage needed to understand the fly fishing lingo. Was very helpful for me."
2,Fishing basics?,The DVD is named as Fly Fishing Basics. I thoutht that it should include many basic techniques before I order it. You will be very disapointed after you watch it. They spent a lot of time to show you casting and making tie. These techniques are not practically used when fishing.
2,Not Nitzsche's Best...,"If you love the arrangements that Nitzsche did for Phil Spector, you'll be sorely disappointed in this weak effort, seemingly knocked off in a session or two. For completists only."
4,It really IS eurotrash,"If you don't like Euro-style techno pop, stop reading. Eurotrash is for those of us who like the softer sound that a lot of Continental techno has, compared to more edgy UK acts that have crossed the Atlantic, like Chemical Brothers or Moby. To me, Eurotrash sounds like a mix between those types, and something like Pet Shop Boys. Throw in a little bit of Chumbawamba for good measure (to account for the bizarre spoken word parts), and you have an idea of what Eurotrash sounds like. I don't think there's anything on US radio that compares, so even if you might not love it, at least it's different."
1,Long and Unreadable,"Although I work regularly in the design of cities, I found this work wordy and largely unreadable. If there are kernals of wisdom about the design of cities in it, they are well-hidden. The text goes on and on for many pages of small type without giving meaningful hints about how to design a good city. Perhaps the book would have been helpful if the authors had distilled it to perhaps 20% of its present length and illustrated any kernals of wisdom they have with good images. Due to its present form, I couldn't make myself read it through."
1,Unreadable,"I really hard to read this book, and also it very hard to get some technique to design a real community. even though it has a n.....ice cover."
3,Average fare here from Aird.,"Inspector Sloan and his sidekick, Crosby are called to the Almstone Flower Show after the grisly discovery of the local midwife who was doing a crystal ball act was found dead, garrotted by person or persons unknown. With the return of an heiress to a large allotment of land, the timing becomes very suspictious to the detectives. Was she killed because she could prove that Richarda Meadows was who she said was, or was she killed because she could prove the heiress to be a fraud. We are left guessing until the end, where we see little greed, and poor stewardship lead to a motive for cold-blooded murder."
5,Wonderfull !!!,I found this CD Rom to be the easiest and most powerfull tool to practice tango. Also it made me pass the exam at Tango Discovery easily. Thanks!
2,A little disappointed in Tango: Structure of the Dance,"I am trying to learn the Argentine style of tango (on toes instead of flatfooted and starting on with right back or left to side instead of front left, front right, quick, quick, quich) and hoped this CD would help. The disk is probably worth buying just for the video clips but I wish they were labelled and explained. Except for the animation of the Arthur Murray type drawings, the explanations on the CD are pretty much like reading a book. It would have been nice to have videos connected directly to the explanations."
1,Doesn't work on long hair,"I bought this product online. The first time I tried it I knew it wasn't all it claimed to be. I have long hair and unlike the other reviewer, it got stuck in my hair everytime. If you're hair is longer than one full rotation around the revo styler, it will get stuck. I tried it a second time and really made an effort, I watched the video and everything, and my hair still got stuck. I've never used it again and it's sitting in the back of my closet. Back to the trusty old curling iron..."
4,Greatest Hits Percy Faith,"This was the first cd I bought from Percy Faith and it has some great music on it.You'll find his version of the Syncopated Clock,Jamaican Rhumba,Till,Non Dimenticar,and a lot of others.The song till is accompined by a male chrous a rare treat.This is the only song I.ve heard a male chrous on.I beleive most of these songs are from when he first started recording.I don't know what year this album was from probebly the early 50s but it has some good songs from when he first started.This is a good starter album for all Faith fans."
4,Old Treasure,"This is a great CD with lots of great instrumentals. I particularly like ""A Summer Place"". I listent to it while I am driving and it puts me at ease. This CD is a temendous value for your dollar!"
4,"Wonderful music, too few songs. (Not Stereo!)","This CD has some great songs. Percy Faith was a great arranger and performer. The problem with this CD is it is very short, and more importantly, the songs are all in mono. I know the music recorded after 1958 was in stereo, however, Columbia used the mono mixes on this CD. Too bad, the stereo mixes were much better quality, as heard on other CD's. In any event, on music content alone, it is worth the small price I paid."
4,Greatest Hits Bring Great Memories,"Best remembered by me for ""A Summer Place"", this compilation is beautiful and very nostalgic......elevator music (according to the unappreciative younger generation) which everyone eventually should enjoy."
4,A GREAT CHOICE,"I own this album and find very wonderful. His classic THEME FROM A SUMMER PLACE sounds excellent, just as I used to hear on the radio when I was a child, or when it is reproduced at my favorite radio station. What a great sound in SYNCOPATED CLOCK and the latin ambience in DELICADO. I can only say from this album. Very much recommended."
2,great for a kid who isnt rowdy.,"my 8 year old tore this up within about 20 minutes of opening the box. just plain cheap. You get what you pay for, or rather you don't get what you don't pay for."
1,worst gun in the world,I got it fully charged it was working fine then the triger got jamed and so did the switch and the gun gave out and broke
2,this gun sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I put money into it and I wish I never did. Don't waste money on this. You can see the freakin curve in the bbs when you fire it. The flashlight you have to hold in the side to keep it on. The chain clip runs out in like 2 minutes. And the gun is all plastic I can not find 1 piece of metal on the gun. A it is not STYLISH that is the BIGGEST lie I have ever seen. The charger starts to smell like smoke after a half hour. the gun is not heavy like they say it only weighs like a half pound. And the little clip shouldn't even be called a clip it should be called trash. the chain clip jammed when I got it in a airsoft war. And to unjam the clip you have to take it appart. When I got the gun I tried to mount the electronic scope and the didn't give me the bolts to hold it on.So don't buy it.
5,Awesome :),This is an awesome gun and it came with in 4 days. :)..Every thing was well packed and alot of accecories. Really nice. get the gun.for 40$ its worth it.Although the banana magzine it comes with does not want to fit in the magazine slot hopefully your guy's does. I'm gonna have a youtube review of this gunmy youtube channel is Airsoft4ureviews .....stay tuned
5,A great and fun gun to use,This is a very fun gunits battery is short to chargeIts clip is pretty goodIT is also easy to useIt is a good first gun gunAnd I have had this gun for a long time and I have had no problemsAWESOME GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,HORRIBLE SERVICE/HORRIBLE PRODUCTS!!!!,"I WILL NEVER EVER EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN! RECIEVED MY GUN AND IT LITERALLY BROKE ON ME THE NEXT DAY. WAS TRYING TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT AND IT JUST BROKE. IT WOULD NOT GO AUTOMATIC OR SEMI-AUTO, A BULLET WOULD GET STUCK AFTER EVERY SHOT. ALREADY LEFT A REVIEW FOR THIS THEY EMAILED ME SAYING THEY WOULD REFUND ME AND ASKED ME TO REMOVE MY COMMENT SO I DID, THEN THEY SAID THEY WILL ONLY REFUND ME IF I RETURN THE ITEM, THE ITEM HAS BEEN IN THE TRASH FOR DAYS.. THEY ARE LIARS! HORRIBLE AT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I URGE EVERYONE NOT TO BUY FROM THEM!!!!!!"
1,THIS THANG SUCKS!!!!!!!!,I got the gun and it didnt work my worst order experience ever....Only reason i didnt send it back because i dont have a ride to the post office :(
2,My first airsoft.,"I ordered the mp5a5 from Air Splat for $30 + $14 for shipping. I got it ahead of schedule. After I charged it, I shot it and it shot pretty well even though I was using .12g bbs. I took it to an airsoft war and it performed well. The chain mag runs out easily though. I took it out into the forest and shot it for a while. Even at this time, I was still on my first battery life. Then, the thing got jammed like 5 times. I cleared each one out. THEN, I was running through the forest when the mag release just FELL OFF! I look and looked but couldn't find it, so now I have a working mp5a5 with a clip with no ammo stuck in it. All in all,save your money and get a quality gun that has metal innards.ProsLong Battery lifeHuge clipConsJamsBreaks quicklylong charging timeplastic insidesSo dont get this gun."
1,cheap plastic product; awful return policies and correspondence,"Looking for an inexpensive 1st airsoft gun for my son. Not this one! Broken coming out of the box, doesn't look like the picture. Has a screw in tip for the silencer that was broken. The chain magazine box would not stay in the gun when inserted. When corresponding with the seller, took days to get any kind of response from them; had to fill out forms and e-mail or fax back (no fax number included), and take detailed pictures of the defective product. I have never had this type of experience with a vendor through Amazon and would not recommend this vendor or this product to anyone."
2,WTH.,"I want a refund. The gun was 3 days late, and had NO extras. The gun itself is OK, but it burns through ammo in the ONE clip that I received. Don't buy."
1,This gun brakes so easy!,"The nozzle on the gun broke off right when i un-screwed it off. The bb's that come with the gun get jammed inside the gun. The hig-capasity mag does not work at all, shoots one bb then i couldnt get it to shoot. Again! This gun is horrible FPS and will break the first day you get it like mine did. I was gentle too!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!!!"
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT HORRIBLE SERVICE,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY....Received no response by email when I contacted them concerning product was also disconnected on the phone...Its a big piece of broken plastic!!!!!!
4,"Good gun, just not too powerful","This gun isn't made of the most high quality plastic, and it came in a box marked ""UKARMS"". The gun doesn't shoot far or powerful (shoots about 100-150 feet). It will make a dent in a pizza box, but won't go all the way through. It looks very stylish and real, and it a semi and full auto airsoft gun. Would recommend!"
4,Good Looking Airsoft Weapon.....horrible scope,"So, per my 16 year old (who ordered this MP5). This airsolt MP5 machine gun looks and feels awesome! Like the real deal. Love the looks, love the speed loader.....now for reality. If you don't mind batteries.....well, the battery takes a while (12 hours first time) to charge but when it does, you can mele/spray 10 targets in seconds. The scope SUCKS!!! Sorry, to say. :( I mean, it's ""find the MP5 at Amazon, buy the MP5, get it delivered, open the box, grab the gun, charge the battery, throw the scope away and have fun!"" My younger brother got G36 from Airsoft Joe and WOW, that scopes ROCKS!!! When you look through it, you can actuall 'see'.....but, other than that, enjoy the MP5Notes for my future airsoft purchases. No more batteries!!! Either Spring or CO2.Thanks, zac"
3,It is a good starter gun but there are better,"First things first, the gun is a CYMA brand airsoft gun. It is NOT metal. The plastic is thin and cheap, my gun tip broke as i was taking off the mock-sliencer. It is indeed 200 fps and less. Its effective range is about 50 yards. The gun shoots fast and can empty its low cap mag in less than 10 seconds. My red dot sight came broken so nothing to say about that. This gun is very light and feels like a toy. I do not recommend this gun, it is made of flimsy plastic and has low fps. There are better out there just gotta look. ""These aren't the droids you're looking for..."" quote master chief."
5,Cute!,my dad would luv it if i bought this doll cuz he plays golf almost every saturday i think cloe is pretty and i like that the bratz are playing sports besides shopping
3,GOLF?,I love Cloe but why golf as a sport?!?! I think there are plenty sports in the world to choose a better one for such a beautiful doll!
5,"fat asses (hee hee, smiles)","ok i am sorry 4 my language but i am SOOOOWW sick of the retard my scene fag parents.just buy this doll,huh? there iz nothin wrong with it or the other bratz.dolls."
1,my opinion -== my review - this doll is ugly,I think golfing is a sucky spport so it mathces this ugly doll perfectly. cloe has the uglioest face i have evvvvvveeerrr seen its so sick its deformed.and if your not going to say anithin nice to me dont say it at all bevcause ill comment back with something 100 times worse.
4,SHE'S GREAT BUT.....,WHY THE GARGANTUAN FEET?????? THE DOLL HERSELF IS VERY PRETTY WITH BEAUTIFUL HAIR AND MAKE-UP NICELY DONE. I LIKE HER OUTFIT TOO EVEN THOUGH THE SKIRT IS A BIT TOO SHORT. YEAH I WOULD BUY HER. BUT I WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO HIDE THOSE DARN BIG FEET!!!!!
1,NO BRATZ,I don't like Bratz they sink. Don't say bad things to My Scene lovers. I do not like this doll.
5,SOOOOOOO CUTE!,"I think this Cloe doll is SO cute! MGA made this doll wear a mini skirt becuase it looks SO cute. I know, no tmany people would go out and play golf in a mini skirt but they are just trying to be cute!!!! I mean, it wouldn't be adorable with scott material pants and those golfer shirts now would it be? THIS DOLL IS SOOOOOOOOOOO ADORABLE!!!!-tori"
5,what,first i know any little girl would not cry that she got a bratz she would be very happy so there and second their just dolls i mean cloe makes golf look sexy third i know you are no tiger woods your self so dont critsize and also their not leg warmers their socks sorry i forgot your to dirty to where them and if you got this doll and relized how many people love them ypu would shut up so peace and to all the bratz fanz keep rockin on
2,Effective only part of the time and the taste is not relaxing in itself,"I love standard Bach's Rescue Remedy. It was first recommended by my vet and it works great on both my cats and my human friends.Rescue Sleep has only worked intermittently for me. It's so heavy in alcohol, it leaves an awful taste in my mouth. Since i have to get up, brush my teeth, and try to relax and get comfortable afterward, it just doesn't seem like a really relaxing tonic to me."
4,Big help in getting to sleep faster,Friend gave me some due to my problems with falling asleep- worked after first try and buying on-line is much less expensive than buying at local Health store.
1,Save your money!!!,Product was a joke. Has 27% alcohol. Just buy the booze. Useless!!! This was my positive rating. Won't tell you how I really feel.
5,This stuff really works.,I was a little skeptical at first because this is an all natural product. After doing some research about the ingredients I decided to purchase it. My husband and I both have been using it with great success. The best thing about this product is that it is non-habit forming. I usually spray 3 sprays and then drink some water. It is extracted with brandy so it tastes like alcohol! I also have the Bach's Rescue Remedy for stress.
2,Not really sure what it does,I've tried it several times and I'm not really sure if it works or not. I taken both before sleep and when I wake up during the night.
2,bring on the nightmares!,I use other types of Rescue Remedy with great success but this Sleep aid consistently brought on some wicked nightmares under many different situations and when I did not use it more than once every few weeks. I must be sensitive to one of the herbs.
1,Don't waste your money,"Complete waste of money. Tastes bad, too. Knowing that the Bach brand is a respected brand, I hoped this product would work. Save your money, because it doesn't work. I had to give it a star in order to submit this review. If not for that, I would have given it no stars."
1,didn't work at all,"I tried Rescue Remedy based on the reviews, even though nothing seems to help (even 3 Ambien don't help me sleep!). Didn't do anything. <sigh>"
4,Wife-Saver,"I originally purchased this product for myself, but I have come to find out that with my snoring, it has helped my wife much more. She is more likely to sleep through the night, giving both of us better sleep, and less bruising to my side from her once constant barrage of elbow-jabs. I recommend this product."
5,side effect,Since I've started using the Rescue Sleep Remedy (5 days) I've also had nightmares every night involving violence but it's weird because I seem to be really rested during the day.... I read somewhere that this can happen if you have repressed feelings and then it will go away (never knew I had so many repressed feelings....). But I've given the product 5 stars because I do wake up in the morning feeling rested and I have confidence that with time the nightmares will go.
4,Bach to the Rescue,"It works for me. I spray twice underneath my tongue about 15 minutes before going to bed. For some reason it clears your mind from your day's event, ie: you kinda stop thinking about stuffs when you're in bed.It's not like those Antihistamine or Tylenol PM which knocks you out like a Mike Tyson Punch. Rescue Sleep Remedy has a very subtle effect, being made from different flowers in the U.K. as I gather from its description. It relaxes and calms you down.Dreams may become vivid but; there's no hang-over in the morning. Next time I'll check out Valerian Extract (standardized) which is also a popular sleep-aid."
3,Not sure,It's just too hard to tell whether this makes any real difference in falling asleep or staying asleep through the night.
1,Vivid dreams,"My boyfriend and I both tried to use this, after becoming avid lovers of Rescue Remedy. However, and maybe this is just us, we both had crazy vivid dreams and woke up feeling groggy the next morning. We ended up throwing it out after trying it for two nights, because we both just didn't like what it did to us. My suggestion is to try meditative breathing or soothing sounds before going to bed instead of this spray."
1,didnt work for me !,"this stuff did diddelly for me ,it didnt help me sleep at all ,i will not purchase it again ,it does not work!"
1,Hopeless product - Does absolutely nothing,"I purchased this product after reading rave reviews about it. My sleep problem - I generally sleep very well.. but 2 weeks before, I had a sleepless night and now I am scared to go to bed because I have started doubting my ability to fall asleep. I have been so horribly sleep deprived and feel very tired. I got this product today and was excited by the thought of sleeping peacefully after a long time - I sprayed the liquid twice in my mouth and waited and waited, nothing! Added another 2 sprays and now it is close to midnight and I am writing this review completely awake and alert.The sleep remedy has done absolutely nothing for me and I am completely dissatisfied with this product. Do not buy and waste your money on this product."
2,Way overpriced,"It boils water. It looks pretty on the counter. It has maintained its luster. You can get your hand inside it to clean.Beyond that it is just an expensive pot that doesn't have the usual features of a Tea kettle.You can't pour water until you grab the hot plastic bird whistle and pull it out. With hot stream gushing out this is an interesting game. We went through a couple ""birds"" before we got one that even whistled and as many others have said, it doesn't sound like a bird. It sounds like the whistle of a guy who was just at the dentist. It also has a cheap wire spring clip and lasts about a month. We have some Alessi stuff. Some is good, some is like this, overpriced... way way overpriced. Did I mention that it is not worth the money."
1,"silent bird gave me"" the bird""!",Love the design but watch out if you get a silent bird you may just melt and burn this kettle. May I suggest an English kettle that has a loud whistle. It has a homely look but is trustworthy. This kettle is chancy.
4,Expensive But Beautiful,"If you are shopping for an Alessi kettle it probably is for the design. The kettle itself won't boil water any faster or better than much cheaper kettles, but it is of quality construction and should last you for many many years.The little bird sits in the spout of the kettle and whistles when water has reached a boil, but must be removed before pouring. The handle is sturdy and stays cool during use.Amazon offered the best price I could find on this kettle and although a little high, you get a very attractive kettle that is built to last."
5,Mid-Century Icon,Incredible water kettle and aesthetic. Price is no object with this kettle because of the icon of Mid-Century Modern Design that follows Alessi and Michael Graves. Great piece to own whether you use it or not!!!
2,Tin Roof...Rusted???,"I noticed after the 2nd time I used this kettle that there is rust forming in the inside in 2 spots above the riveting. I've never seen this happen with a stainless tea kettle before?I googled the problem and picked up on it elsewhere on the internet that it has happened to other people.I sent the manufacturer a note asking them for a recommendation in cleaning the rust or attempting to prevent it, and received -0- response. I made sure I left the top off and emptied out all the water so as not aggravate the situation more.Other than it's nice to look at; for me, I cringe at the thought of potentially ingesting rust particles."
4,Alesso Kettle,"This kettle is all that I expected......attractive, functional, works well...only it doesn't really whistle loudly enough to be heard in any room other than the kitchen......so it is easy to forget if you are in another area of the house. Not as loud as the old fashioned tea kettles were....too bad, as that is the only negative here."
5,the ultimate metalheads dream come true!!!!,"I can't believe i didn't know about this band ,exhorder is the most intense shredding thrash band i have ever heard since forbidden,but frankly i think exhorder blows everybody away!!I hope it's true that they're making a comeback,because i think i found my new favorite band,if you're a big fan of pantera listen to these guys i think pantera was influenced by them."
1,"Worthless book, not objective or worth the money","Just like many people out there, I wanted to read about Islam. Simply put, this book has been a bad choice. The authors did not really sound as though they knew what they were writing about. Their arguments just did not stand up, and in some cases did not even make sense! It seemed that they wanted to talk badly about Islam as a religion no matter how bankrupt their arguments seemed. I wanted to find a book on facts and sadly this is not it."
2,A waste of time,"For all the work that the author's must have done to get information for this book, it is beyond me why they wrapped it up in a silly love story novel. For me, it totally took away from the information presented. There are pages and pages of text that can just be skipped over unless you are the type that enjoys a story about Lois Lane and Clark Kent saving the world from terrorism. A silly book."
1,Clever Disguise,I purchased this book with great anticipation that I would learn about Islam and why they hate us. The authors could have told us all they know about that in a few simple pages. Instead they cleverly disguised their own agenda which is preaching the Christian doctrine that one must accept Christ personally and take the Bible literally. There is far more preaching Christ in this book than real facts about Islam. This is NOT an objective work.
1,"Fiction, not facts","This book is truly preaching to the converted. If you believe anybody with a beard or a weird head-scarf is liable to murder y'all in your sleep, out of sheer religious madness, look no further. You'll be convinced that all your prejudices are well-founded. Hey, just remember there's a reason why it's published as fiction.If, however, you do not believe a specific religion to be at the heart of the world's problems, you probably should look elsewhere for a more balanced read. This book will surely annoy you, as it did me, by its manipulative provocation and one-sidedness.Religion can spur people to atrocities. But that goes for ALL religions."
5,Awesome Book,A creative way to tell the truth about Muhammad & Islam. I knew very a little about Islam and the Qur'an before reading this book. I have a much greater understanding of Islam. It was a real eye opener. Muslims are being manipulated and oppressed thru Islam. Many quotes from the scared books of Islam are used thru out the book. This book is probably one of a few that proves that Islam is an oppressive doctrine masquerading as a religion. I think alot of this book. Buy it!
1,Craig Winn wrote a book on Islam?!,"Right. To be honest, I have not read this book and do not plan to. My only interest is that it is somewhat curious that Craig Winn has transformed himself from a ""netrepreneur"" who built a marginal catalogue company cum ""revolutionary"" dot-com into a Muslim scholar?! Both the May 1, 2000 Business Week and David Kuo's ""Dot Bomb"" make it painfully obvious that the demise of Winn's Value America was a direct result of his deluded sense of place in the world combined with a profound inability of managing anything larger than a lemonade stand. Maybe I am a bit harsh, but these are not the sorts of qualities that I would expect a ""fairandbalansed"", objective view of Islam to flow out of (much less anything that could be considered even remotely readable). Don't drink the kool-aid, folks."
2,Pro-Christian Bias,"I agree with the authors that Islam is a dangerous religion, but,then again, so is Christianity - which these authors push. So thiskind of nulifies the credibility of their presentation.It doesn't take long to spot the bias, in fact on page 1 we read""Terrorists, most of them sons of Ishmael, all of them Islamic..."".The story of Abraham, Israel & Ishmael is just that, a Hebrew storyin the Bible and not necessarily historical fact. In fact manyobjective scholars dismiss it as myth. Furthermore, calling someonea 'son of Ishmael' is a ""put-down"" as the Bible speaks with opprobriumregarding that name.""Can't we just all get along ?"""
1,"Ugly, Hateful, biased, Intolerent, beyond extremist.","When I read this book as study on the christian right I expected it to be an average piece of hate literature against a peaceful religion like unveiling Islam. I was wrong I couldn't even finish the book and had to sit down it was so horrible and hateful. It is a fictional book kinda like a tom clancy novel but worse. This guy thinks that by waging a christian holy war on all muslims and forcing christian values on them will win the war even though 99% of what these two bigots propose violates international treaty! As usual they take the koran out of context while ignoring the fact that the bible condones religious genocide all the time! Worse, They make snarled and racists remarks about muslims and arabs... WOW! Christians are such peaceful and open people Huh?...No one should have to buy this book and read it. I [dislike] it because it is divisive and hateful. Reading it literaly hurts..."
1,Lair,"i have read this book and have done thorough research on islam and other major religions too, but this book does not have a lot of authentic or traceable facts. this is just rubbish."
5,READ IT ! READ IT ! READ IT !!!,"I wish everyone in the USA could read this book....You need to read this book.....very interesting, very excitingly written. No more head in the sand. Look about you, and know what is coming down.Truth is given out. No hatred, just TRUTH.Get it, and read it ASAP..."
3,edit edit edit,The subject matter and story in this book are great. It is a commendable effort to expose the truths about Islam. But the writing is at a very elementary level which is insulting to most adult readers.And it is difficult to read through all of the grammatical errors. A writer should know whether the word 'its' needs an apostrophe or not.There are so many errors in the book that it distracts from the story; I find myself re-reading sentences and wondering how they published a book with the mistakes that I just found. It really is unbelievable that this book was printed with so many mistakes. Shame on the writers and the editors.
4,Tea with Terrorists,I would rate this among the 'must reads'. It arrived on time and in the condition as described. A good read if you want to be informed.
5,Author has guts,"Most of the population is afraid to tell the whole truth. If we want to beat the war on terrorism, we should heed this advice. Well documented without bias."
1,UNREADABLE,"The beginning of this book is promising and although it is very badly written I found myself getting caught up in the story. As it progressed it bacame more and more a rant against Islam. I do not know if it correctly portrays the teachings and history of Islam as it purports to do but it refers to other sources which I am going to follow up. I almost never stop reading a book, however this one was put away at about 230 pages. I just could not read more. The story line gets silly and predictable and the romance more and more unbelievable. I am a Christian but I found their continual discussion of Christianity very hard going and they don't seem to use the same Bible I do. I would not read another book by Winn and Power but I will make an in depth study of Islam on my own."
1,Gibbering howling roaring Drivel,"This is a work of utter comedy. It will no doubt cause the breasts of many Chest pounding neocon self rightious facists to swell in Indignation as a Hunkjawed Superhero saves America from nuclear doom. Anyone who has a semblence of intelligence will be using it as toilet paper within a page.This ""book"" is a madcap insane paranoid schizophrenic's foam flecked ravings whilst doped up on christian religiously drugged dogma.It has 2 goals. 1) to prove Jesus created dinosaurs on the ark 6000 years ago and 2)to laugh at Islams silly beleifs. Pot Kettle Kettle Pot.It turned me into an Atheist halfway through, and for that, I thank the authors and their hilarious numerology of proof. Its worth buying for the bit where they calculate the odds of a zombie carpenter messiah being wrong. ( answer is 100000000000000000000000000to the power of 64 :1. Thats Pure MATHS people!)Buy this if you relish Irony."
4,Tea with Terrorists,"Tea with Terrorists has a fantastic storyline. It hooked me immediately, and I found it difficult to put down. It was talked about on the Art Bell Show. The authors actually went to terrorists and interviewed them as told in the chapter, Tea with Terrorists. The book is teaching about Christianity, but the main theme is exposing what the authors have discovered about Islam. I checked their evidence with the Koran at my county library and found their examples to be true. This is a book I'd like to discuss with the authors."
5,Something of a revelation,"I grew up queer, gifted and --um-- white trash, in a brutal world with little hope and no heroes. In ""The Freddie Stories"" Lynda Barry creates a character as true to that experience as any I have read, and shows that kids without heroes must become heroes... and Freddie/Skreddie is a true hero. Just as Lynda Barry re-forms the arts of narrative and cartooning to the demands of her unique and eloquent talents, her queer, gifted, white-trash Freddie reshapes his own world -- through a harrowing series of agonies -- into a place where cast-away kids become creatures of miracles. Not since ""Bastard out of Carolina"" has a writer approached this shadow world with Barry's insight, brilliance and compassion. Just as Holden Caulfield still speaks for disaffected youth, Freddie deserves to endure as a spokesman-hero for this particular tribe of disenfranchised of children. Note: the back cover is worth the price of the book."
5,"Amazing, dark, touching","This should be in the poetry section of the bookstore, only then no one would buy it. Part fairy tale, part magical realism, part comic book, part poetry--it's hard to classify this astonishing book. Freddie's nightmarish year and attempts to keep his sanity by thinking about nature made me cry many times, and I cheered for him to get through it. Visceral, raw, terrible and beautiful. Wow."
5,LYNDA BARRY IS THE BEST!,"Lynda Barry is so good it's amazing. This is not her best but it's still a must read for fans. If you are new to LB buy ""Fun House"" or ""Big Book of Marlys"" first, and than come back to this one. All her stuff is great. Insightfull, Truthfull, everything real is in her work-READ IT-READ HER!"
4,A departure from Lynda Barry's normal style...,"The latest Lynda Barry chronicles the life of Freddie. It is a disturbing departure from Ms. Barry's normally whimsical, funny, sad, and insightful style. Freddie is plagued by horrible events, including several emotionally disturbing times in his life. There is a semi-bitter-sweet conclusion, and I still recommend this for the Lynda Barry fan."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,"Being a major Lynda Barry fan, I looked forward to her first new book to be published in some time. Sadly to say, the book does not meet my expectations. The illustrations are as wonderful as ever; the storyline has wonderful possibilities; but half-way through the book, I wanted to throw it against the wall! The main character (Freddie) begins speaking in some type of 'wierd-speak' which actually caused me to look ahead in the book just to see when he would stop! This 'baba-baby' talk severely interrupts the flow of the story. I also noticed that the text of the story is, for some reason, much larger than in the past, and limits the size of the drawings to sometimes no more than the bottom third of the panel. I will re-read the book to see if I missed something."
1,I love Lynda Barry but this one is a sincere disppointment,"I am sad to say I did not enjoy this collection very much at all, mostly because it lacks Marlys and Maybonne! Freddie is very different from M & M--I can't believe he's related to them. There are lots of trippy skulls and bad kids who kill old ladies, and none of the pimply fun of M & M. I do not recommend this one unless you are trying to complete a collection."
1,very dissatisfied,"I ordered the Crosley Corsair radio from Amazon and it was sent to me by Beach Camera. It arrived and did not work when I plugged it in. Not a sound. I called Beach Camera, who told me they would replace it. They sent me a free shipping label and I returned it to them by fed ex. I didn't hear from them for a long time. When I finally called them to find out where my replacement was, they told me it was no longer in stock. Since the charge was on my visa, I told them to refund my visa account and that I would get another radio from someone else. I still have not received my Visa credit. I purchased a crosley solo radio from the local Target store and am very happy with it. This was a particularly unsatisfactory Amazon experience."
5,Crosley Radio,This was a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it! At Christmas she plugged it up and it had good sound and just looks really cool!
3,good news..bad news,"My daughter wanted a radio that looked ""old school"". This fit the bill. However, it turned out to be too large for her bedside table. Sadly, there is a 20% restocking fee to return the item.So...a bit disappointing."
1,Save your money...Mine is just awful!,I loved the picture of this item...I had just the place to put it in my home where it would look great. It does look great. It just hardly works. The whole thing only weighs a pound or two...this should have clued me in right away when unpacking it. The switches have an imprecise and awful feel and seem very delicate. The sound quality is very poor (Remember those less than $5 transistor radios?) and the reception is worse. Even the strongest stations in my area only come in with a great deal of fuzzy sound and you can always hear the radio stations near them in the back ground. I haven't bought anything electronic that was this bad in years. Don't be fooled by the good looks...in this case beauty really is only skin deep.
1,"Looks good ,BUT!","The radio looks real good,sounds good but the cd would only play 3 songs and stop. Called customer service no problem at all, was taken care of. Only problem was I wanted the unit but when I ask it to be replaced I was told they would not replace it because it had been a problem on other units."
1,cute but not fuctional,The radio is nice looking but the reception and the sound is not good. THe sound does sound like a cheap transistor radio that another reviewer discussed. I wish I had read the review prior to the purchase of this radio.
4,Crosby Alarm Clock Radio with CD Player,The Alarm Clock Radio works well and has good sound quality. I bought it based a lot on looks and the fact that it still had a CD Player with it instead of an IPod Dock. Also it looked to be good quality unlike some of the other CD player alarm clocks sold in stores.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT WHAT IS YOUR NAME?,"I recently bought this CD. The beautiful TENNESSEE WALTZ is no more. What a disappointment. Can someone explain to me why it is that when a song is a multi-million seller and works well in the original, some executive somewhere decides to re-arrange it? This is a fiasco. However, the re-arrangement of CHANGING PARTNERS works well. So all is not lost. To be avoided."
4,Not the originals but worth a look,"These are re-recordings of Patti's hits but not necessarily bad. In fact I like the versions of ""Detour"" and ""Mister and Mississippi"" better than the originals. The arrangements on the originals weren't very good. These are much better and Patti still sounds great. I'm usually an advocate of always having the original recordings (and still am) but sometimes the re-recordings are just as good or, as in this case, better. Kay Starr and Jo Stafford re-recorded their hits and they were wonderful. So is this one."
2,Redone and not well.,"This is a stay-away recording if you're a Patti Page fan, which I am. When she left Mercury, they decided at Columbia to redo all her greatest hits when disastrous results. Go for the Mercury recordings of 'The Mercury Years Vo. 1 and 2."
2,"good Patti, bad arrangements","Quite a letdown after looking forward to receiving this CD for weeks (not the best job of shipping Amazon has ever done for me). Patti Page's voice sounded great, but the arrangements were nothing like the ones I listened to growing up."
3,It's Patti Allright but not the ORIGINAL Patti !!,Songs are the originals but Patti must have recorded these last year. Somewhat dissappointing.
5,True UK Punk!,"Love the Swell Maps! If you are a fan of authentic UK Punk, then you will love the Swell Maps. Item arrived as expected and in three days of ordering it."
5,The Fixx are so Under-Rated,"It's really a shame that many people still haven't heard their music. I think this is one of the most under-appreciated bands ever. Cy Curnin and the band are so incredible. The vocals, music, lyrics, and melodies are simply incredible. I would put them in my top 10 list of my favorite bands of all time, right there with The Beatles, The Who, Depeche Mode, Tears for Fears, The Cure, etc. And this Cd is one of my favorite. The vocals are crystal clear and the music is as beautiful as any work of art. I highly recommend giving the band and this CD a listen."
4,An inspiration to daily devotions,"The Rosary on CD is very convenient! The scriptural readings help to make the rosary more meaningful than just doing the prayers alone, and the background music is inspiring.The format is very convenient. This allows one to do the appropriate Mystery each day. Also, it's easier to do the Rosary while driving when not holding the beads!"
3,good western,"Roy Rogers realizes before everyone else does that Stuart Hamblen is not the man people make him out to be. It isn't before long that his theory turns out to be right. Stuart Hamblen and his gang have signed up to the Confederate army but their fight is not ethical. They're louting and killing the people who went to the Union side. It's Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes duty to stop it. This is a more dramatic effort than the usual Rogers vehicle. Stuart Hamblen is great as the cold bad guy. Off the subject I liked his album Hymns. The leading girl in this is a lot like the one in The Old Corral, a proper girl taking vocal lessons. More like 2.5."
1,Horrible,I normally do not review books however the grammar in this book is so terrible its questionable whether the author passed 3rd grade grammar. I am far from the grammar police (while actually being a sworn police officer) but this book was so painful to read that I could not get passed the second page before I threw it away.
5,It reminded me a little of Beauty and the Beast,"I think that's the best description I can give. If you went by public opinion then Kane was an unrefined beast and Houston a wallflower who did her duty of standing about and looking pretty to a T. But they are so much more than that, there is a goodness in Kane that is hidden behind anger and his gruffness and Houston makes you admire her when you realize that she is so much more than the prim, proper twin. There are so many moments that make you smile or laugh. Very enjoyableWhen I first read the section where Blair confesses she slept with Lee, I felt betrayed for her. But Houston definitely got the better part of that deal."
2,No way this is 5 stars!,"The story-line was decent enough except that it dragged and rambled in places.What really got to me was the hero and heroine. She was indecisive, somewhat whiny and strangely bland (despite that sad desperate attempt to make her interesting by involving her in some sort of secret sisterhood). He was godawful. With his broken redneck speech and hairy ways, I kept picturing him as a dusty Paul Bunyan type with beard lice and dirty nails. NOT ATTRACTIVE AT ALL. I know variety is the spice of life but this hero was just too far off the beaten track for me."
4,I like the Taggert Family,I like it when the book toches on a family that I have read about in other books by Deveraux. This is a good story.
3,Too similar to Twin of Fire,"Seem like a repeat of Twin of Fire. Many, many typos in the Kindle edition. Not up to par for Deveraux."
2,Not intriguing,The story line and characters weren't that interesting. The heroine seemed whiny and spoiled. The hero's story kind of kept me interested but his speech annoyed me a bit. I don't understand how this book gets 5 stars.
5,THRASH METAL BEST ALBUMS - PERIOD!,"How can people prefer Metallica, Megadeth or Slayer instead of Annihilator is something unclear to me and really makes me sad.How can't the world value the talent of Jeff Waters?Well, if you are into thrash metal or virtuosic guitars but done with originality and memorable riffs and awe inspiring and breathtaking changes in tempos, it doesn't get better than Annihilator.Some may argue about Set The World On Fire being too much pop-metal oriented or that the voice of Jeff diminished the power in such gems as King Of The Kill or Remains (all albums post - Never, Neverland)but the intense glow with sheer perfection of this two first Annihilator jewel albums can not be touched!The fact that Roadrunner gives this two to you, the elusive buying public, at the price of one album and remastered both of them plus bonus tracks is mind - blowing!Highly Recommended! What are you waiting for? No, you don't need to listen to samples! Just buy them.You will thank me.Trust me!"
5,better than you would believe,These cd's are great. Being an old rocker that dabbles into things like suicidal tendancies and Ozzy this stuff is unbelievable. These guys combine metallic speed with a lot of talent. I'm definately an annihilator listener now. I must get some more. Jim
3,Poorly Recorded,"Miles' trumpet is clearly the featured instrument. And its tone on this recording is harsh and frequently distorted.There are numerous superior recordings of Miles in concert, on various European labels. Those performances are much more enjoyable than this one."
2,Miles at Carnegie Hall,"This is Miles at Carnegie Hall with his group, including the underrated tenor saxophone of Hank Mobley. Also, the Gil Evans Orchestra makes an appearance. The sound is unbalanced and raw. Fans of Mobley will obviously want it, though."
3,People with asthma often need magnesium supplementation,"There is significant evidence that the root cause of many, if not most, cases of asthma (and many allergies as well) is deficiency of magnesium. This fact is discussed in detail by Dr. Carolyn Dean in her excellent book The Miracle of Magnesium. Dr. Dean recommends 600 mg of supplemental magnesium daily. People with asthma who follow Dr. Dean's advice about daily magnesium supplementation often improve dramatically even if they have continued to struggle with asthma under other treatments which omit magnesium supplementation. If you are suffering from asthma please read Dr. Dean's excellent book and follow her advice regarding daily magnesium supplementation. It may well be the most important thing you will ever due to relieve this terrible ailment. By the way, although a variety of magnesium supplements are available, and beneficial, chelated magnesium -- which is readily available in most health food stores -- is the most effective."
2,Mediocre at best....,"This book is better than the Nikon instruction manuals that come with the D1 family cameras, but only marginally. A lot of the information in this book can be found on digital photography websites. Also, this book is rather padded. Far too many chapters include duplicate information which leads me to believe the author simply did a cut-and-paste job on several of the pages and used them throughout the book. Another thing: the photos in the book are (for the most part) very nice but the repoduction is very poor. It is difficult to see the quality that these cameras are capable of by looking at these soft, slightly out of focus images. There are some useful tips regarding white balance and extra software, but for the money I felt this book was a disappointment."
4,A Complete Compilation! Alegria!,"If you're wondering I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is a compilation of great hits. However, by now, everyone including deceased members of your family should have heard ""Alegria"", the new bangin' cut he has released in years... included here. He recorded ""Suavemente"" by Elvis Crespo, the most played out song last year, but Tono gives it a new life by proving that he is arguably the best merenguero in the bizz right now with his voice and awesome production. The rest of the album is good with old cuts like ""Estupida"", ""Jenny"", ""Asi Fue"" and much more. Overall, Tono is ""La Alegria del Merengue""!"
2,Uncleanable Handles,"The faucet that I have is not precisely this model, but it looks the same. It has the same clear-plastic handles and and the same black-plastic sprayer. (The base of my faucet is rectangular instead of oval.) It has probably been in place since the house was built, about 50 years ago. By now, it is understandably scratched and deeply scarred, but what I object to is the difficulty of cleaning it. You have to fold a dishrag in half and run it around the base of the handles periodically to remove accumulated sludge. However, inside the clear handles is a disgusting accumulation of filth and mold that is impossible to remove. As for the sprayer, it diverts only a tiny fraction of the water from the faucet, so it wastes enormous amounts of water when used."
5,Great history of the biz,"This is a great doc about the history of advertising. My only complaint is they returned to the billboard family too many times. A must-see for advertising students and anyone who wants to know about advertisings creative revolution, which needs to happen again soon. This economy has made advertising mostly bland because agencies laid off the big thinkers and hired an army of Interactive programmers."
3,interesting,"Art&Copy is an interesting set of interviews with interesting people, but do not expect much more."
2,Sub-Title would have been nice to see.,"Ordering and delivery were good. The product works and displays the show on the TV, but I was disappointed that it didn't have subtitle tracks. I guess I shouldn't have expected to have access to subtitles on the disk but I did. Next time I'll look a lot closer at the spec's on the product."
2,Cool Blade,I like the knife except.... First time I used it was to cut up a small fish for bait. The handle on one side fell off. I could have glued it back on if it had not fallen overboard. So if you buy this knife a little pre-maintenance glue could help save this knife.
4,sweet,"i ordered this knife on the 19th and it came in on the 22nd :) i feel thats pretty good since the estimated delivery date was the 25th. the carrier that the knife comes in is a belt loop holder. which i did not expect but works out either way. the blade seemed a lil dull when i took it out of the box, but im going to fine tune it anyway. solid craftsmanship (handcrafted in china is printed on the blade). good weight to it. For the price of [...] bucks i like it."
3,Decent for price,"The knife shipped fast, which is definitely a plus. The box it came in was cheep and bent up, but the knife was in fine condition. The actual knife has no major issues, but rather a few small ones: 1.It is much smaller that picture makes it seem, the blade appears to be only about 4 inches. 2. The handle is small and uncomfortable with cheep plastic like knuckle holes. 3. The sheath is not good, slightly to small for the blade so the tip pokes through the top of the sheath. Overall this knife is what you payed for it, CHEEP, so if your looking for a quality knife, look again, but if you just want a cool looking, fun knife to mess around with, definitely worth the low price."
5,It is great. It is totally worth the money.,This knife is awsome. I bought it and it was really cool and came in about 3 days. It is great qaulity.
2,Not what I expected.,Im sorry I look up shoulder strap knife It comes up with this and it says its a shoulder and there are no straps. Got to spend more money to buy one.
1,budk,alright so me and my friends are starting knife collections and i thought this would be a good addition to my collection....its not. its a cheap chinese ripoff of a buck blade and it says budk on the side. it has glue on the blade from where they attached the handle and the blade is already loose
3,Could be better.,"Looks can be decieving is the exact quote that should be used for this knife. Going off of that statement i dont know if this will affect your judgement of whether or not you buy this knife, its only my opinion.The knife is 2 pieces 1 being the actual blade and the other being the handle. as far as looks go i get comments on it all the time everywhere i have it, it always is a head turner for sure. as far as sharpness goes your gonna really have to work on the sharpness forever because it is about as dull as they come. and price you cant beat it i mean even for the looks and compliments you will get its worth it but if your lookin for a good, sharp, everyday carry around knife you should definetly go somewhere else."
5,Love this knife - good price too,"Looks good takes an edge, and versatile, good in SD, and in the pack. got 6, putting 4 in different survival packs for different activities, and two on the knife all in the weapons room - just cuz they look nice up there LOL... I like these -"
4,Not a toy,It's a good knife..not an all purpose tool but good to have on your side.I had to sharpen it a bit.I recommend it... Peace!!
1,These DO NOT fit Eclipse GT 2006,"Ordered them as they listed as compatible for my '06 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT. When I tried to replace them, I found out that they completely do not fit my car."
5,Nostalgic Tony Brent,"I enjoyed listening to Tony Brent on CD and would like to see another CD with all the missing songs e.g. Why ask for the Moon, Forever my darling, Let's fall in love, Marie, Wonderba, Butterfly, In my Little Room. The message from his daughter was touching. Perhaps she has the LPs and EPs which could be reproduced with the best sound production on CD. Hope Amazon takes note of this and releases more. Thanks for the opportunity for sharing my appreciation of Tony Brent's songs."
3,Only 20 minutes ... requires very specific equipment!,"This is the instructional DVD that comes with the balance ball resistance kit. Unless you have a very specific piece of equipment ..... the harness (that fits around the ball) & 2 short resistance cords that clip to the harness - this routine will not work for you. This was an OK workout, but too short."
1,It's not what I expected,It is alright but you lose interest in it quickly and then gets pretty boring. I think the handling of the car could have been better.
1,Not near as fun as the origional,"Let's see, in this game, #1. no multi player #2. no hidden cars, this was the appeal of the first game in my opinion. Don't waste your money, even if you find it used, like I did. Buy the origional, cause this one should have been cancelled before it ever hit the production line. Enough said ~!"
5,This book was great!,I really enjoyed this book. It was a page turner. It kept you on the edge of your seat. Pike gives Alisa human emtions and makes her a character you can sympathize with. Many books that deal with vampires paint a picture of blood and gore. They depict vampires as monsters without a conscience or soul. Pike's book is a refreshing change from the norm. I am planning to read the rest of the series to find out what happens next. You should too!
5,For any young fan of the Thomas The Tank Engine series,"The Collector's Edition Of Thomas & Friends Best Of Gordon presents in a DVD formate the lively and entertaining adventures of the fastest and most powerful animated railroad engines of the Island of Sodor. Gorden's stories, his friendship with Thomas, and the lessons he learns about friendship make for engaging and wholesome viewing for young folks. Nine wonderfully presented short stories, plus bonus features such as exclusive games and a commemorative booklet, make The Collector's Edition Of Thomas & Friends Best Of Gordon a real treat for any young fan of the Thomas The Tank Engine series. Running Time: 46 minutes, plus 60 minutes of bonus features."
4,Brings back classic stories(8 out of 10),"Okay Gordon isn't one of the main characters so there weren't very much stories to put on this tape, I mean some of them aren't even about Gordon they just have Gordon in them. But then again, this tape did bring back some of my favorite stories like Gordon and the Famous Visitor and Gordon Takes a Dip therefore, I gave this one 4 stars."
5,A DVD I WATCHED AT LEAST 60 TIMES IN A 2 WEEK VISIT WITH MY 4-YR OLD NEPHEW!!,"MY 4-YR OLD NEPHEW IS INTO THOMAS THE TRAIN BIG-TIME, AND I BROUGHT HIM THIS DVD DURING A RECENT VISIT. I'VE BOUGHT HIM NEARLY EVERY THOMAS DVD, BUT ""THE BEST OF GORDON"" IS HIS FAVORITE AND WE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ALL OF THE THOMAS DVD'S ARE GREAT FOR KIDS. THEY ARE SHORT, BUT TELL A GOOD STORY WITH A ""USEFUL"" LESSON. IF YOU ARE A THOMAS FAN, YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THE MEANING BEHIND WHAT I JUST WROTE! LOL!"
4,It simply serves as a reference more in favor for a Plant Based Diet,"It is clear that nobody will tell you that animal products is beneficial against cancer.But many autors (many scientists) will tell you that Plant Based Diet prevent cancer.I also recommend:T Colin Cambell's ""The China Study"" andA Race for Life: A Diet and Exercise Program for Superfitness and Reversing the Aging Process by Ruth Heidrich"
3,Nicely built product but no interest to cats,The living world cat spa seems to be a well built cat product but our 2 cats show absolutely no interest in it. That doesn't mean that it won't work well for others but just note that ours sits all day with no attention.
4,2 out of 3 cats love it.,"They completely ignored it for the first few weeks but now they are rubbing all over it like little crazies. Basically if your cats like to be brushed, like to keep rubbing themselves against rough things, and insist on you petting them 24/7 then this will work for them. The only cat of mine who doesn't go cray-cray for this kitty spa is the one who hates her daily bushings and likes really gentle petting."
1,Bad idea for multiple cats.,"When I bought this product I was so excited, having 3 male cats in my household I have cat hair every where. Then the product arrived. The port on top where the green nub is poorly designed. My poor cats are biting on it to get the cat nip from the holding area. Lets says there is blood on it and I feel really bad now.Then the other males woke up to discover there new toy. It started a cat fight like I have never seen my boys ever do. I can already see my vet bill rising with any further use of this product."
2,Lo ignora por completo!,"Califiqué con 2 estrella el producto, aunque no creo que sea malo, tal vez a mi gato de 8 años no le interese jugar con el spa, lo ve, lo rasca un poco y se va, asi que opté por guardarlo para cuando tenga mi proximo gato."
5,Fun times!,I picked this up for my cat that loves to rub her chin on everything she can touch. The second I set this down she was all over it! The feature to add catnip in the toy is a great feature. My cat loves this little spa!
2,Tedious to clean and fill,"I had this years ago for 2 previous cats (now deceased). I wrapped it for Christmas (yes, corny, I know), and the cats could smell the catnip it came with through the package, so chewed on it until I let them ""open"" it. Then, one paid little attention to it, while the other monopolized it, as long as I could keep the teeny-tiny compartments for catnip filled. My cats very quickly destroyed the gum massager, and cleaning the hair out of the various brushes was time-consuming. Prepare to spill a lot of catnip getting it into the compartments. The toy also takes up a lot of room and is difficult to store. I threw this out a long time ago, have a new kitten now, and will not waste my money on one of these again."
2,Cat could care less,"I haven't completely given up hope. As I put together the ""spa"", my cat was going crazy, climbing in the box, flopping on the pieces. The moment I finished, she ignored the spa and hasn't looked at it once. It's covered in catnip, maybe she'll rediscover it."
4,3 out of my 4 cats love it!,"Three of my cats adore this thing....one even sleeps on it from time to time. The other one occasionally visits it but is not all that interested. I agree with the other reviews, you just don't know from one cat to the other; but I'm not at all disappointed with the product."
4,Roy Rogers movies,"I am a big fan of the late Roy Rogers and this movie is one of my favorites. It is one of several of his movies focused on horses--namely, Trigger and Trigger's son. It has plenty of drama, suspense, and action, with great shots of the horses. I recommend this movie to horse-lovers, especially. Trigger is blinded in a fight with a killer stallion, and Trigger, Jr. must step in and face dangerous situations as he also helps a young boy overcome his fear of horses. THe movie is well-done and the pacing is good."
5,Nice Match for Printer,"This little bag makes you more apt to pick up your printer and go with it. It has handy compartments to store anything you need for being on the go. Good quality, good price."
4,Epson PMBAG05 PictureMate Deluxe Carrying Case,"It needs to be just a little bit larger so I can fit an extra ink cartridge, photo paper, and the three cords I need to hook it up to my PC and plug it in to an electrical outlet. The printer itself does fit snugly into it's compartment,though."
2,Not worth the $$,"Bought this as a gift and was disappointed when it showed up. Not suitable for taking to the gym, which is what it was intended for. Battery cover immediately fell off."
1,This was the worst birthday present for my husband,"The MP3 player was fine until one day it just read ""upgrade"" in the display and won't work anymore. I will never buy another product from this company again. They offered no troubleshooting advice except to take the batteries out for 20 minutes and then reinsert them. That didn't work. Thank God this didn't cost alot because I would be furious!"
2,Poor Quality,"Length:: 0:20 MinsI have been a tool and die maker for more years than I care to remember. These precision screwdrivers were a disappointment. Although the blades appear to be ground nicely, the handles DO NOT run concentric to the shafts. It's hard to believe these were made in Germany, a country with a reputation for quality.Please see video."
1,Very Muddy,"If you're expecting a clear DVD sound, skip this one. Joni Mitchell is the queen of clear vocals and acoustic guitar but this DVD was anything but. The sounds were muddy and even had a great deal of vocal distortion throughout. If after this review you still must have it, wait for people like me who sell theirs, you'll get it for a song."
3,Great music ---good camera work ----disappointing sound!,"Hopefully this DVD can be remixed and reissued! The guitar dominated watery/echoey ""mono"" sounding surround sound mix(no better in 2 channel stereo), gives no presence to individual instruments. Mr.Blade suffers the most, his contribution being that of a great instrumental mime!"
2,Disappointed,"Have been extremely pleased with all of my DVD music videos up until now. Compared to James Taylor ""Live at the Beacon Theater"" or John Fogerty's ""Premonition"" to name just a couple, this is a total disappointment. It is if nobody involved with this video tried very hard, including Joni Mitchell. Although I have no idea if bootleg DVDs exist, I can only describe the audio and Video on this disc as ""imagined bootleg quality""."
5,Out of the ballpark!,Joni is a goddess and I venture this: she is #1 - a renaissance woman in the full. Far from disappointment that her voice isn't soprano.....it is in full maturity.Her beauty and talent shine in this movie - I am so thankful to have come across it and watch/listen to it over and over. I always loved her early music but had no idea she had grown into this luminous creature. Don't miss this...her version of Why Do Fools Fall in Love? worth the price.
2,Poor Video Quality,"Perhaps the making of Joni's blurred video was intentional and considered artistic, but I expect and want all of the video definition potential of DVD technology. The video quality was that of 1960s color TV broadcast. I couldn't very well appreciate Joni's performance as I was constantly irritated by the video quality. If Joni had any wrinkles, I sure wasn't able to see them <g>!"
2,What a Disappointment!,"Having followed and loved Joni Mitchell's work up to (and including) ""For the Roses,"" I expected great things from this disc, especially in DTS. From the first line of ""Big Yellow Taxi"" it was obvious that Joni Mitchell has blown out her voice with years of smoking (the cover even shows her with a cigarette in her hand). There were only two or three of her early songs (and they were performed poorly). All the other songs sounded alike and bored me to tears. Even in DTS 5.1, the sound was distant and thin. This was a real disappointment. Try Roy Orbison's ""Black and White Night"" (includes AC-3 AND DTS) for a involving performance with a stunning and truly surrounding sound field - the room literally comes alive! Check out the difference between the two sound tracks if you can. The AC-3 is very exciting, but the DTS is a little fuller and much sweeter."
5,Great value and gorgeous to look at,"This is a beautiful humidor. Lid closes just the way you want it, with a push of air, evidencing the good seal. Seems to me these used to go for over $300 at the cigar heyday."
1,inaccurate information,"I have not read the book but after having read the piece about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), I doubt if I ever will .The article shows the author's total disregard towards the sensitivity of the Muslims. No image of the Prophet (PBUH) ever existed. To print the portrait of a person resembling a random Muslim conqueror, appearing more akin to Salahuddin, is not only improper but according to the Muslim belief is also blasphemous. The author owes an apology to the Muslim world for creating this badly researched, inaccurate and malicious article as a lesson in history as it serves no other purpose except to misinform the readers and hurt the Muslim sentiment. I also voice my protest against `Bluewood Books', for allowing this article to be published."
1,Inauthentic Reading Material.,It is clearly evident from the material in this book that Mr. Samuel Willard Crompton has employed very few to none highly irresponsible sources when writing it. He has been very careless while giving out information and has clearly lost his credibility as an author after having written this book. I am surprised that the publishers (Bluewood Books) even agreed to publish such a negligent piece of work. Such inauthentic material should definitely not be allowed to reach the market. I think that the publishers should take into consideration the harm such false and incorrect information can cause to the general public as well as to their image as a publishing house and should take the book off the market!
1,?!!,"I haven't read the book yet, and to be honest I do not intend to do so, I have heard about a book in wich a picture of the prophet Mohamed (PBUH) but I couldn't believe that such a book could have been publshed without having thought about the muslim comunity and how can it react toward what can be called an attempt to divulgate wrong or unaccurate information about her prophet. In fact none has ever had a portrait of Mohammed(PBUH) so how can the writer allow himself putting such a picture of the greatest leader of muslims?!! it really is a shame that such a book has been allowed to see the light!"
1,A successful Author,Am sorry to put it this way that either the author is an alcohol abuser or he does not have a clue about Islam at all.It is suggested that the author needs to go back to the basics of writing about history.A successful author is known by what he writes.....Samuel Willard Crompton... please!!! there are some other great ways to earn name and money.
1,Contemptible display of knowledge,That book is merely an attempt to hurt Islam. Writer used fake informations as there is not a single picture of Prophet Muhammad(MPBUP)and he showed a picture of Him using his ridiculous imaginations. This book should be banned and should not be allowed to come in the market because the writer is trying to damage the image of Islam and Prophet Muhammad (MPBUH) by using wrong informations.
1,A step towards new crises between Muslims and Rest,"Its good to have libertaion of expression, but not expression which can not only hurt more than 1 billion population of this world, but also initiate a new series of troubles. its now very old way to become popular by writing this kind of evil books. Author definatly could write anything positive to get money so he decided to write this book. He did what he could to make money, no mater this evil money can hurt people feelings or may be serious problems in different parts of this world. It should be banned as soon as possible."
1,Wrong Information.,"The chapter on Coquests of Mohammed, the Prophet(PBUH) has a picture of the Prophet(PBUH) which is not authentic and it goes against the tenets of Islam. This will alienate the Muslims world over. The artcle should be edited and the picture removed from the book. There is no authentic picture of the Prophet(PBUH) and depicting one is a sacrilage."
1,"wrong facts, wrong depiction, wrong book, wrong author",I was surpised to see the author trying to depict Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This book is nothing by a mere evil creativity by the unprofessional author. I hope the author realizes this and does the needful.
1,Outrage from the Muslim Community (Ummah),"This book deserves 0 stars, and I can tell you why. In Islam, it is absolutely prohibited to draw the slightes portait of the Prophet Muhammed PBUH. Why? Because Islam is a monotheistic religion, it does not depict idols or potraits of any form. All Praise is to God Only, the Creator. So, Please I the Muslim Ummah request that Amazon.ca stop selling this book, and that the false Potrait of the Prophet of Islam be taken out of the book by the auther himself."
1,Improper allegations,Pls stop the improper allegationas you are using against islam and against prophet mohamed.
1,useless to read,"Just by seeing a page of it, there is no need to buy the book. Buying this book out of curiosity to know what is inside based on the comments already witten will only increase the sale and fame of the author..."
3,Don't believe in islamics.,"Don't believe in islamics.Some islamics wrote bad critics about this book.As ever happens, they are buffoons,liars and ridiculous.They claims that this book is against his religion.This could be right, but many other things are against islamic religion.One of then is the American Constituition, who to example, gives free religion, free speach, woman's rights,etc.All of then are, against Islam.If you don't know, 100% of the about 55 countries in the world, with Sharia's law are third world countries.I read all this book, here in Brazil, in a translation to portuguese.It's cheap, concise and easy to read.At this side, there's problems with this book.At first it lies about Paraguay's war, claiming that Paraguay was a industrial power at that time.A ridiculous lie, first created by Eduardo Galeano, a fanatic marxist, from Uruguay.About 5 wars weren't to stay in this book, because they didn't had enough importance.The book is cheap, concise, but has some failures."
1,Errors in account on Genghis Khan,"On page 33 of #26 ""Conquests of Genghis Khan 1206-1227"" third paragraph down it says that ""He [Genghis Khan] pursued the heir of Shah Muhammad, Prince Jalal ad-Din northward into Russia, won a major battle against the Russian princes in 1223, and then returned to Mongolia,"" is in error. Jalal ad-Din was pursued to the Indus River where he escaped southward into India. Genghis Khan did not go into India. He did not go into Russia either but sent two of his generals, Chepe Noyon and Subotai, after the fleeing Shah Muhammad, who was slain, and afterwards these genarals entered Russia and battled the Russian princes."
4,nice book to instill 'blowing your nose' manners!,Clever story about frogs and their runny noses. I like how it gives a message on 'nose manners' without being preachy. Beautiful illustrations and cute dialouge between sniffling frogs!
5,probably my favorite album of all time.,"this is classic jeff buckley. he's down to earth, humorous, quirky, and unbelievably talented. he combines jazz, pop, folk, rock, a multitude of languages, influences, and styles into something that can only be classified as ""unbelievable"".after borrowing this album from a friend, i popped it in my discman, thinking that it would cure some insomnia. i ended up staying up the whole night just to finish it. and yes, it's really that good."
2,Self-Indulgent,"As other reviewers have indicated, this is not the place for the casual Jeff Buckley fan. The man obviously had talent, but too often over these two discs he seems to be playing strictly for himself. I am reminded of many nights jamming in a friend's basement where songs would often last ten minutes or more. Sometimes we would be brilliant, most times we were much less than that. While this was fun for us, it made our girlfriends run for the hills. Now I know how they felt."
1,This blows,I am a fan of him and Grace is still one of the best cds of the 90s but this sure does blow. His voice is mostly awful on this. I especially dont like those very long covers he does on here. The way young lovers do does not need to be 10 minutes with a bunch of annoying sounds. The listable songs on here are the short ones . The reason Grace was good is becasue it was well produced and his voice was more polish. It surprised me that this thing averages 5 stars on amazon. If he did not die young this cd would not even seen the light of day. I am so glad i did not buy this i found it at the libary. This show's you how awful this cd is this thing retails for 30.00 yet i found it at a libary.
3,Missing their best song,"How can anyone give this a 5 star rating when it is missing their greatest song, ""Try to Remember""?"
3,"thoughtful, historical yet not lacking development","Bataille's writing is simple, the words succinct, and the message is clear. Witnessing the transformation of the missionaries as they spent years away from their home country was impressive. Still, I felt as though there was a lack of character development which made it difficult for me to fully appreciate this transformation. Perhaps if I would have read this book as a long poem vs. a novel I would have felt a greater connection."
1,It didn't test out for me,I also wrote TradeStation code for each of the trades and then tested the last few years and wasn't happy with the results. It was at best a break even strategy with plenty of risk. I expect the trades were just curve fitted to write a book.
2,Still Waiting,"This book sounded very promising. Peyon Amberg is a woman without direction, trying to find it. Her mother is mentally ill, her brother in and out of rehab and prison. She marries, Barry, a dentist although she doesn't really love, and gets bored. She goes through the passages or life, married, has a baby, travels. This novel tells of her extra marital affairs. Which even those are boring. I read the whole book waiting for it to get better, it never did. But I would give Janowitz another chance and check out on of her other books, but from a library."
2,Tama Janowitz hates women,"In this book, Tama Janowitz expresses her own intense jealousy and hatred of women in general. She forgets that the sexual revolution is over and women don't need a man to take care of them. She hates any women that are married, single, poor or middle class. Which is 99% of women anywhere.She writes a story about a women who is misled into trying to conform to society's stupid ""rules"" for women, and when she does not conform is led to misery and shame. Her message to young women is awful: Women are worthless without a man. Why do all her female characters lack self-esteem? Only a women that hated other women could write a book like this. Misogyny is thinly disguised as nihlism."
4,A nearly compleat treatment of shikantaza,"This is certainly not a book for somebody looking for a general introduction into zen budhism. But for those more accustomed with zen writings there is really much to find in this book. Everybody will enjoy to find new aspects of ""shikantaza"". The classical writings are welcomed, too, although not all are about the art of just sitting. So the book looks just compleat. Or is it? One point left me slightly annoyed: not one of the numerous modern authors comes from Europe. Seems like the Bush administration, J. Daido Loori is fine with the US and the old Europeans do not count. But there is a large and active school of Soto Zen in the tradition of Dogen in Europe, thanks to many years of teaching of T. Deshimaru Roshi, a disciple of Kodo Sawaki. A pity that none of his successors from Spain, Italy, France or Germany was invited to participate. Future editors of such books should do better."
2,Manipulative and misleading,"I felt ahmed had some good points about some issues but I feel he used speculation and conjecture to manipulate his evidence. The arguement that Saddam Hussein had support of his fellow arabs was plain and simply erroneous. I feel examples such as this are irresponsible and unethical for use in a text of this nature. Also, I realize the book was meant to be a little antagonistic but I think he went to far in pushing his opinions and spent too much time criticizing a few western indiviuals."
1,Do not use,This stuff will ruin your wheels if it gets on them. It says wipe off if it gets on them. I did it within seconds & it still leaves spots. Thus making extra rubbing to get the spots out. This stuff is junk!
4,"Solid, and it fits","Purchased this for my Epiphone WildKat, which is larger than a Les Paul but much smaller than a normal archtop. The FlameKat is an alternate limited edition design of the WildKat and the FlameKat case fits it perfectly, the inside is well padded, the extra compartment is large enough to hold a strap and picks and some other accessories. The only downside is that the lock on top is extremely low quality."
2,Dangerous to use,"I have a pair of these knee pads with McGuire-Nicholas branding. I have found these dangerous to wear, especially when moving around on your knees at heights, such as when installing roofing or decking. The pads are too thick (too high) and they displace your weight too narrowly resulting in ""tippy"" knee pads."
3,Don't Age Well,"I use these knee pads for occasional hands and knees work around the house, like scrubbing floors. They're pretty comfortable, and the straps are big enough for thicker legs (though not _really_ thick legs). The neoprene straps can be a bit warm, and as another reviewer mentioned, they tend to tip/slip around the shin while walking around on your knees, but it's only a mild annoyance for my needs. My biggest complaint, however, relates to how these kneepads age. After a couple of years of this very occasional use, I found that the foam rubber on the kneepads started to disintegrate. I'd be washing the floor that I'd just swept/vacuumed, and kept finding little chunks of black stuff in my path. After figuring out where it was coming from, I laid on a layer of duct tape, but even that's coming off now, because the foam rubber underneath keeps disintegrating and falling apart."
1,Not What My Doctor Recommends!!,There is not one receipe in this book that my doctor would approve. This is more of an Atkins book than what the current recommendations are for gastric by-pass patients. I'm returning my book.
5,Fantastic!,"I thought this book was great. For somebody who likes to eat but doesn't like to cook, this book contains easy and yummy recipes that even I don't mind making. I always thought anything ""protein"" was boring but the author gives great ideas for seasoning and sauces that are no to low carb and delicious at the same time. He uses combinations of ingredients that one might think is strange...until you try it and love it!!! Also, his cooking techniques make meats moist, juicy and tender. These recipes make losing weight a fun and tasty experience. My family loves them too!"
5,Culinary Classics- A winner cookbook for Low carb eating,"Having had Gastric Bypass Surgery a year ago, this cookbook has great recipes but also offers general ideas for cooking low carb. It emphasizes the importance of flavor in our food. I am a cookbook junkie and this cookbook is my new favorite."
2,poor choice for cookbook,"When you open the book, it looks like a gastric bypass persons dream. Yummy. But after i bought this book to my nutronist she said that i should not use this book because i would be doing nothing but dumping. All the ingredients use a lot of fat ingredients. Ex: oil, butter.Honestly if my nutronist did not tell me not to use this book i probably would have."
3,Sacred Sex or just Prostitutes - You Decide.,"Twenty five years ago a major ruckus was caused when My Secret Garden : Women's Sexual Fantasies by Nancy Friday hit the book racks. Men and women who feared their erotic fantasies called it pornographic, yet today books on sexuality, segregate sex partners, orgasm coaches and sacred prostitutes are in vogue.Using the BIP CD Rom the keyword ""sex"" brought up 6,058 matching titles --- someone out there darling is focusing on the physical. One of those writers is Kenneth Stubbs', In ""Women of the Light"" Stubbs has collected nine essays that look at the exploits of the nine ""sacred prostitutes"". These are various women who supposedly bring together ""spirituality"" and sex for money (about the same way a professional athlete brings together ""spirituality"" and ""sports"" for money - not). This is a radical book attempting to make the case that ""sexwork"" can be a source of healing, psychological growth and spiritual awareness. You decide. Conditionally Recommend."
3,Open ypur mind and accept,"This book is so true of the new attitudes of our 'new women'. If you stand in judgement you will not accept change into your life. There are beautiful women out there working with their sexual power for healing. There are many people out there that suffer with their intimacy problems and sexual inabilities. Most can be healed with love and a patient friend and partner. Perhaps the partner is not able to give this unconditional committment to helping them. Probably they don't have one.Gone is the prostitute that took drugs to give a man relief for money - the picture painted in our media. The new women are beautiful in their hearts, good living, caring for their body - the garment they wear over their soul.Think about everything you read here... It is happening in our world today and futhermore the healing is working !!!"
5,Whoa!!! These Guys Are From 2002!,"I couldn't believe these guys are from Tempe, Arizona in 2002 when I first heard them. They sound like mid-70's era New York punk such as The New York Dolls and Johnny Thunder and The Heartbreakers.If you are a fan of this genre I recommend picking this album up."
5,Heart Breaking and Warming!,"The story of Katy and her family is one to be admired. I can't wait to read the next two books, and anxiously await knowing what will happen. This family is truly one to be admired. Kerr Barkley put a heart and soul into the Quartus family."
1,"Shouldn't Have Been Released, Yet","I can't believe that Activision is charging money for this software. It's not ready for release, yet; heck, it's not even ready for beta-testing. The software I received is so full of bugs as to be almost unplayable."
5,Simple solution,"Nice little knife guard, nothing fancy. Appears durable, fits snuggley over knife blade. Simple solution so I don't cut myself when reaching into the drawer."
4,A MUST HAVE !,"This is a great video for all who want to relive the days of the so-called Watergate scandal, whether you've been old enough to see it live on TV back then or too young (like me) or not even born then. The video is especially fascinating when you've allready read Stephen Ambrose's Vol. 3 of NIXON (Ruin and Recovery 1973-1990) and Nixon's MEMOIRES: the video brings you the feelings from 'outside', the books from 'inside'! So the content of the video would earn it 5 stars; unfortunately many broadcasts are in black and white instead of being in colour, so I rated it with ""only"" 4 stars. But that doesn't matter at all: it's really a MUST HAVE for everybody who's interested in the Watergate affair and the resignation of a great American President!"
2,Certainly cheap but very bad sound quality,I got this because of the price but I don't use it because the sound quality in the speaker/earbud is very poor. It sounds weak and muffled and tinny like the pilot on an airplane. I could make do with it but it's pretty bad.
5,Excellent CD,"This is one of my favorite CDs. I play it so often I am quite sure the CD material would be worn off by now. Definitely danceable music, very upbeat, but contrary to what another poster said, Amparo did not write all the songs. The last song ""Son de la Loma"" is a very old song from Cuba, written by Trio Matamoros (it sounds like a scratchy old bolero on that set). If you have ever seen the ""I am Time"" CD collection, this song is on that 4 cd compilation. Still Amparo's arrangement is upbeat and modern and that song is my all-time favorite on this album. Also get her earlier CD ""Punto de Partido"" if you can. I have that one as well, but it is more mellow than ""Ano del Gato"""
5,KATE THE JOURNAL OF A CONFEDERATE NURSE,"THIS BOOK IS WELL LAID OUT AND READS GOOD.ALSO,THIS KIND OF HISTORY FROM A CONFEDERATE SOURCE IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY.I HAVE A FAMILY THAT WAS VERY INVOLVED MILITARILY IN THE CONFEDERATE CAUSE,SO THIS MEANS A LITTLE MORE TO ME.SOME OF THEM WERE IN HOSPITALS AND POW CAMPS,SOME DIED.THANKS NORMAN VADEN"
2,Couldn't get through the second chapter,Couldn't get through the second chapter. It was such a difficult read and was not engaging. I tried to start reading it again and it just wasn't working.
1,Boring and dated,This was a required text for my class and I think my professor keeps it part of the curriculum so that he doesn't have to buy a new book. This book is excruciatingly boring and long and does not go in depth into any topic. I would look elsewhere.
2,Not a great book,"""The Borgias"" by Marion Johnson is a good book for anyone who wants a quick overview on this quite appalling Roman family with Spanish roots. It has nice color and b/w illustrations, genealogies and maps. It is an easy read, but the lack of serious scholarship is evident. Often, the author goes back and forth in time even within the same chapter and sometimes just rambles on without a thread of thought. The book also misses a map of Rome and the Vatican, home of two Borgia popes."
5,Real Actual Authentic Guide to making $$$ on the Web,"Antion went through trial and error to succeed at driving people to his web sites and getting them to open their wallets. He CLEARLY explains how to do it.Very user-friendly, content-heavy book. It is the Real Thing."
5,Electronic Marketing For Small Business,"I am always purchasing and reading books on small business and entrepreneurship. Obviously, the internet offers great opportunities for entrepreneurs. However, getting started and gaining basic knowledge can be very confusing, frustrating and costly. Tom Antion's Electronic Marketing For Small Business is a great guide for learning how to get a profitable internet business started. The book is full of extremely useful information from software products to additional training resources that one can acquire without spending a fortune. Also, I found the book to be fun and very entertaining something you don't find very often in business and technical books."
1,Don't Purchase This Book Unless You Are A Newbie,"The Ultimate Guide to Electronic Marketing put me to sleep. It includes only the most rudimentary information about working on the internet. There are very, very few marketing tips. Most of the information is basic like advice to choose a good web host. On every page Tom tries to sell you a product created by himself or a friend and he includes his affiliate information at every possible opportunity. This book would only be suitable for someone who has been living under a rock or on another planet for the past five years."
5,A Cure for the Internet Marketing Headache,"""The Ultimate Guide to Electronic Marketing for Small Business"" truly is the ultimate guide. If I had one book to recommend for someone with no desire to become a techie, this is it. Tom gives the step-by-step details of what it takes to be successful without getting bogged down in techie speak. This is a well written, easy to follow resource you can give to your assistant and have him do the work. This is THE ultimate guide to doing business on the Net.Lynn Pierce, FounderWomen's Business Empowerment Summit"
3,Pretty good basic Electronic Marketing book,"I have read several books on the topic of Electronic Marketing. This book rates average in my opinion. The first half of the book is pretty basic, but would be useful to a novice at E-marketing. The 2nd half gets better with a number of good specific examples and refers the reader to many useful websites/weblinks. Chapter 3 on Mechanics of Website Sales is very good and practical covering how to build an online store, get credit, shopping carts, merchant accounts, using a turnkey outsourced store, etc. If you're a more advanced E-marketer, you might find the book too simplistic. Overall, given the price of the book, I think it's worth reading."
5,Good Guide to Applying the Elbow Grease,"I found Antion's book definitely worthwhile. He lays out what he has found to be successful in a clear and understandable way, and he covers a tremendous amount of ground. I particularly liked his take on testing (product, price, copy, etc.) and how it can work for you online. Please do note, however, that this is not a 'get rich without work' scheme. He lays out the plan of action, but the reader must commit to the actual work (and it is work) to accomplish that plan."
5,The Ultimate Guide to Electronic Marketing for Small Business : Low-Cost/High Return Tools and Techniques that Really Work,"Finally a book that speaks the truth about internet marketing. I have taken courses from Tom Antion, purchased his seminar products, and books. I always feel that I get my money's worth and more. The Ultimate Guide to Electronic Marketing for Small Business : Low-Cost/High Return Tools and Techniques that Really Work, is the newest book to his collection of many great products. I highly recommend this book and all of his products if you are serious about making money without unnecessary expense."
4,Table Blessings,"This was a very nice collection of table blessings, but not what I was looking for as a teacher of the very young."
5,100 Graces Mealtime Blessings,"This is a dear, concise, wise little book. It sits on our dining table. My husband and I take turns saying grace each evening, opening randomly and reading. It has prayers from many different spiritual sources and we find it refreshing and meaningful."
2,blessings,i wanted more contemporary blessings or blessings that anyone would be comfortable saying at a meal. Too many ho hum blessings
4,Interfaith Graces,This small book packs a lot of punch. Most graces are short and encompass a variety of faith traditions. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to give thanks for their blessings at mealtime.
4,grace book.,"small but still a nice collection of works. perhaps a bit expensive for such a small book, though."
2,Small book - big price,"I was a little disappointed that this book is so small. It fits in your shirt pocket. For the price, it should be a regular size book"
1,RAMY Alive Blush,"RAMY Blush in 2 ShadesA big disappointment. I have medium skin color and the shade I chose was the Alive. It was not at all visable, actually seemed to match my skin tone. I gave it to my fair skinned daughter, and it did not not even show up on her. Since thrown away, it was just a waste of money."
4,hats off,"this is a solid country effort like they just don't do them anymore. great playing, slick down-to-earth production, ""mostly recorded live"". the acoustics sound great, as does his ryan adams-tenor on the slow tracks. big lyrics on ""she ain't no you"", and with caitlin singing it's almost like whiskeytown never died. beautiful record, perfect for driving. or a barstool, for that matter..."
3,maybe a bad idea,"At first i hated these dolls because i'm seventeen and into punk fashion and music, the last thing i wanted was 10 year olds sharing a fashion/music sense with me or telling me i looked like their collagen injected doll. But now i've realized that this could make the style more acceptable in society and my pale skin and eyeliner not so shocking (never was my goal). I only hope that these little girls don't get so much into the music that they start picking up habits of a 'punk rocker' aka: drugs, alchohol, violence, rebellion, skipping school, etc., those habits can be seen as a teenage trait, but when you're deep into the scene things go awry, so i think that these dolls could be a bad idea for such a young age group."
5,THE BRATZ ARE AWESOME!!!,"I AM AN ADULT, AND I STILL LOVE THE BRATZ... I THINK THEY ARE SO CUTE AND ENGAGING. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SETS OF THEM IS THE PUNK SET... I JUST THINK IT IS SO NEAT HOW MGA AUTHENTICATES THE BRATZ TOYS THE WAY THEY DO. WAY TO GO, MGA ENT.!!"
1,Bratz World London UGLY AND SLUTTY-CLOE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1.YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!2.JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!3.SLUTTY!!!!!!!!!!!4.UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!5.LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!6.SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!-Bratz dolls are worlds worst dolls.I HATE THEM!BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
1,If Bratz were real they would be posers.,I've never been a fan od bratz dolls. I think there ugly. I saw this commercial. Thats right watch bratz go from preps to punks! I agree with the other reviewer who said that these are poser dolls. I am somewhat punk. Kids under 10 should not be aware of the punk culture yet. They should stick with their preppy clothes end of story.If goth comes out I'm gonna laugh my ass off....
1,If you bought this...,"ARE YOU BLIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is the most sl*tty looking doll on this planet for an assortment of reasons:A) She has bleeched-white skinB) Her dog (along with her maker's brain) is 10x's out of proportionC) Her hair doesn't look like a normal Cloe doll's hairI have a friend who lives in London who feels sooo insulted.If you have any combination of the following: Brain, common sense, a life, DON'T BUY THIS DOLL!!! But you don't have to take my advice... Just go and buy it... You'll learn... MUHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,blah blah,"True punk is dead, this is not punk. Punk will never truly come for it is dead. Dead things cannot come back."
3,Could Be Better,"my neice loves these toys. but the ""punk"" dolls need some desperate help. the clothes aren't bad but the makeup needs a little something. it'd also be interesting if you could come out with ""goth"" bratz, adults would probably get those for collections and the like. but anywhoo, the dolls do seem a tad on the ""raunchy"" side. not something i'd like to see a kid grow up to be, same goes with barbie. but at least the punk dolls are a step in the creative direction, stepping away from ghetto redundancy and snootiness."
5,A wonderful read,"From the moment I picked this book up, I could not put it down. Written in a flowing and highly readable style, this novel presents characters that grab your heart and your interest and will not let you go from the first page through the last. Don't miss this book."
3,Librarian's perspective,"As a librarian, I am faced with recommending reading material to a broad range of patrons of different ages, interests and backgrounds. Behold, This Dreamer is one of those rare books that will satisfy readers of several genres. Library patrons will enjoy Behold, This Dreamer by Charlotte Miller on several levels. Written in an easy to read, flowing style, it is a rich historical novel set in 1920's Alabama during the Prohibition era, a social commentary of the extremes between rich landowners and poor sharecropers in the state and a timeless romance of lovers fighting to be together against seemingly impossible odds of rigid social order. Joan Sung, Librarian and Writer/Member of the Southern Stories Foundation, dedicated to developing Alabama stories for film and video."
3,Interesting,"An interesting look at the rural south in the 1920s. I could picture the red clay dirt, the houses and people, but felt little about the characters, their struggles, fears, and pain. The author's frequent repetitiveness of words and phrases was distracting and detracting. It needed better editing."
2,not my type of reading !!!!!!!!!!!,"I found this book very boring. I almost did not finish it. I hate these kind of storys, they depress me. There are enough things in life to depress one without reading this type of book to my way of thinking. Sorry, this is just my opinion, others may enjoy it immensly."
1,Duchess on the Rancocas,"This author not only wanted the Queen Mother to be remembered but to be made a Saint. He is totally biased in his opinions and omits anything negative about his subject. After reading the 500 pages, I knew nothing about the Queen Mother but for a few between the lines hints. From what I can gather she was a very jealous and bitter woman towards the Duchess of Windsor for a reason I can't understand. If you want to really know this woman read another book from a more honest writer. This book was very boring."
3,A bit disappointing,"The Author certainly put a huge amount of research into this Book. The only problem was that a lot of the Content was not really interesting. Quoted heaps from other persons, and assumed they were the truth. Unfortunately, it puts this book into a position where, do you believe him, and does that make all other books incorrect. Surprisingly, with the amount of research put into it, a better Proof Reader should have been engaged. Spelling errors. some words running into others, and. as a Scottish Person living in Australia, I was horrified to see our National Airline, Qantas, spelled as Quantas. Maybe a minor thing, buy with all the research done, surely the mis spelling should have been picked up. I got to the point of flicking through the book waiting for interesting parts, but they were few and far between"
4,Great book about a greatly loved Queen,"Hugo Vickers book about the Her Late Majesty, The Queen Mother was well done. It gave you some insights about Queen Mother's life and some information that was not as well known. I would reccomend the book for anyone who is a fan of British Royalty or anyone who is a student of History."
4,Insightful and 'ah ha!' provoking,"This book is a fascinating look at the origins of the numerous aspects the modern female physical state tends to mimic. Morris moves quite literally from head to toe explaining how attractiveness and beauty have come to be considered what they are today, and why it is that the modern female has been physically and psychologically shaped by her ancestral biology and by social trends to wish appear the way she does. A 'must read' for anyone interested in the idiosyncrasies of what makes the female to be considered attractive and/or those with a fascination of how biology shapes who and how we are in our day and age."
1,huge disappointment - rate it ZERO,i expected some type of art nude showing different types of models or lighting techniques.This is another word book explaining different parts of the woman. The center has a few pages of pictures mostly of fashion. BORING BOOK.
3,PIFFLE.,"Desmond Morris has been utterly trounced and debunked on every side by Elaine Morgan. Read this book if you must, but immediately afterwards read her 'The Descent of Woman' so that you'll spend as little time as possible believing his outdated bunkum.I gave this book three star because, although the overall premise is demonstrably faulty, there were many interesting (if often unsupported) sociological tidbits included."
5,Awesome !!,This is a must read for all men !! This book will guide you through 7 important steps to help you be a better man and husband. It will change your life !!
1,better titled How to Ruin A Marriage,"Bright exhorts men to do things they should be doing in their marriages anyway, while advising them to force their wives, willing or unwilling, into a traditional role in which they will have no true voice in the relationship. Women are reduced to unintelligent, subservient roles with men who are probably seeking to cure their own ineptitude as husbands - and who may already be abusive. Bright even exhorts the man to ""be gentle but firm with her"" when you make the announcement that you are taking a traditional role of husband henceforth, as if your wife is an unruly child. Avoid at all costs."
3,New walkman is missing a few important features,"I bought this Walkman because my old one broke down, after almost ten years of faithful service. This new model has a better ergonomic design - I love the plastic case. And I'm glad they finally put the belt holder the right way round this time!The sound quality is much better than my old one. Tape playback is excellent, almost CD quality. And the anti-rolling mechanism is a godsend - thank you Sony! The mega-bass doesn't seem to add much oomph to the sound though.There are two features that should've been included with this model - recording and a switch so you could automatically change sides. Because these two features weren't implemented, I gave it 3 stars instead of 4."
1,It's awful!!!,It's not the same as I ordered before. Was extremely disappointed and so was husband ... it was a gift for Xmas.
2,How much is there to say about Hand Quilting?,"Just a couple of pages in this book are actually about the process of quilting itself. There is a long part about the history of quilts (quite good if you are interested in that), a gallery of quilts (beautifully quilted) and general instructions on materials and planning a quilt. The author also tries to explain how to make a quilting design fit the size of your own quilt but that is done very poorly. I have seen much better instructions in other books. The quilting part is okay but it is just a few pages. This is definitely not a book every quilter needs even if you prefer hand quilting to machine quilting."
3,Great book but not what I expected,"I found this book to be full of information. However, I was really expecting a book about the actual process of hand quilting not all the other stuff. That being said the other information in this book is AWESOME! If you are looking for an overview book and not a detailed how to for starting to hand quilt then this is for you."
2,Disappointing,"For an anthology that promises zombies, several of the creatures encountered in these pages barely qualify for the term. I'm all for expanding the playing field...historical horror stories are some of my favorite reads, but most of the stories set before the 20th century do not feature ghouls or anything demanding human flesh. So much for ""All Flesh Must be Eaten."" There are a couple notable names in the TOC (Paul Tremblay and Scot Edelman) but this is not their best work or even indicative of their talent. There are much better zombie anthologies around. I advuse against this one."
2,Quality?,"I have this glove for about 3 months, I have holes in three finger, I'm a fire alarm electrician, I doubts about gloves quality, for the price I pay need to last longer, hope this help ( me )"
5,Nice tie clip,This is a very nice looking tie clip and looks as good as it does in the picture. It is well made and seems like should hold up for a long time.
1,Dead Life: Redeux,One of the stupidest I've seen in a while- I should lose my purchasing power for ordering this one- a real dog.
5,Works good,I needed to buy 4 replacements as my other ones were 10 years old so I went with this unit. The plug was the same and that made for an easy installation. However these have no battery backup. I got a different model with a backup for the center of the house so I'm always protected. I have had no false alarms. All my units are white again.
5,"Great deal, works great","Nothing bad to say, this smoke alarm arrived on time and it was easy to install.Nothing bad to say it is all good, thanks amazon"
4,Kidde smoke detectors,"Seem to work fine but can't tell till there's a fire which I'm not hoping for. Used three of these to replace three 10 year old Kiddes in the house and thought the connectors would match but they didn't. The pins were correct but the snap in latches on the sides of the connectors weren't compatible which required the new alarm wires to be hand wired to the old ones. Wasn't a big deal but it obviously would have been more convenient if the new matched the old...another instance of engineers ""fixing"" things that don't need to be fixed."
1,"No support, poor quality","After 2 night time false alarms, I called Kidde for help. No real answers, just the typical suggestion to vaccum the unit out. Or they offered to look at it if I sent it to their facility. (2 weeks)Instead of going without an alarm, I bought another one to replace it. 4 months later, same thing: false alarms (2) both in the middle of the night.Called Kidde again. No help.Send your money to a company that builds a worthwhile prodcut, and can offer support. These guys do not care."
3,Doesn't Have Battery Backup,I bought this detector to replace the builder units. I returned them when I realized they had no battery backup.
1,The Lucy Show Marathon Box Set (Delta & Laserdisk),"I was completely disappointed with this box set. The video and audio were terrible, the worst I have seen on DVD. A complete waste of money. Do not buy this set! Beware of other Delta and Laserdisk productions! I hope this helps others not waste their money!"
1,Worst video quality on a DVD I've ever seen!,I bought these singly for $5.00 a piece from a bargain bin. They simply are unwatchable. Do not waste your money on these DVDs from Delta or Laserlight. They are complete garbage!
4,The Price is Outrageous!,"This DVD is great! It isn't in perfect condition, but definitely viewable. Only don't pay what Amazon is asking for it! I got this set at Costco for only $19!"
3,Question?,"Anyone know if the episodes featuring Ethel Merman and Joan Crawford will ever make it to DVD? Have they already been released? If so, which set(s) do they appear?"
1,Maltese : A Complete Course for Beginners (Teach Yourself),"Mr Aquilina's book was the first modern ""learn Maltese"" title readily available outside Europe. However, it is one of the very few in the Teach Yourself series which the publisher has yet to ""modernise"", i.e. bringing it up-to-date (even re-authoring it) and adding tapes with native speakers. It is only relatively recently that Teach Yourself have begun to add culture notes, pitching themselves more at the middle-of-the-road learner who is keen on travel, rather than the academic. A plea therefore to the publisher: please update this one so that more can learn and travel to this wonderful country!"
1,"Not the best out there,...","The author assumes far too much from his readers. Additionally, this book is difficult to manuever through and needs a thorough updating and clean-up. If you're looking to learn enough Maltese to just get by, then pick up Hippocrene's Maltese/English Phrasebook."
1,A language enthuiast from Texas,I have many of the Teach Yourself series of books. Most of these are very helpful and give good non-technical explantions. This book is very technical in its explantions and is of no help to the language student trying to learn on his own.
2,Title And Content Do Not Match,"I was having hard times rating this book because its title and content do not match at all. This book is called Teach Yourself - A Complete Course for Beginners. Yet this is a typical grammar reference book designed for students of comparative Arabic dialectology as it says in the forword. This book has no dialogs or texts. It only reviews parts of speech and has a total of 31 excerces with kyes in the end. Neither has it a vocabulary.Exercise 1, for instance, has a list of approximately a dozen of Maltese words and tells you to memorize them and then use the with the definite article. No phrases or sentences. And that's how it goes through the entire book. THIS BOOK IS NOT A MANUAL OF THE MALTESE LANGUAGE, IT IS JUST A REFERENCE GRAMMAR (WITHOUT ANY VOCABULARY) FOR THOSE WHO KNOW SOME ARABIC."
3,Better know Phonetics,"I bought this cause my girlfriends family is from Malta, I studied language in College and can tell you this book is alot on phonetics, sounds and symbols. It is very hard for me.With her there to sound the words, it helps, but I wish the book was more user friendly. hahaha."
2,Noisy cover,"The cover looks and works fine but it was terribly noisy from the first. It sounded like a can of washers was rattling around in the back and nothing I could do would stop it. I really could not find the cause for several months of the winter but this spring I lay in the back and kept pounding and twisting and pulling until at last I thought I had it. The joints between the bows and the side brackets would work up and down and make the noise. I took it all apart and removed the bows, then pulled the U clips off the ends. I tapped a 6-32 hole in both sides of each bracket and installed small set screws. I then put it all back together and tightened up the set screws until there was no movement between the bows and side rails. This fixed the noise but it should not have been there in the first place. Extang needs to do a little more engineering. If you do not want a rattling truck and don't want to make the repair. I would not buy this cover."
1,one month of galley,"I just bought that wonderfull program full of expectations after I saw a video demo on the internet + as a fan of Meshuggah, I really wanted to play with Tomas Haake's drums so I paid 80+bucks +20 for european delivery and what do I get ?A sleeping program I just can't use.The authorisation pattern is so complex for nothing, I only got one out of the 2 authorization codes needed so I can't use it and now what ?Toontrack's customer support REALLY is total junk as the only help I had was an email sayin ""go on this website, make an account, pay a couple bucks and they'll help you"" yay great buddies, thanks a lot !Now I payed it and took some time to install it, I gotta find a way to make it work but guess what, I won't pay 80bucks again to have the serials if you see what I mean and ho yeah, I'll NEVER buy a toontrack product again."
5,Santero,"I am a santero from Colorado. My family is from New Mexico. I am a collector of both santos and santero literature. This book/pamphlet is a great addition to my collection. It was very used and understandably for as old as it is, but I am happy I found it."
5,NOW THIS SINGLE IS ON FIRE!!!!!,"THIS TLC'S SINGLE IS HOT.YOU HAVE THREE HOT SONGS ON HERE. ANYONE WHO DIDN'T COP THIS SINGLE,NEEDS TO . TLC IS #1 FOREVER WITH ME SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"
2,From someone named Mustard i expected a spicier book,"What a hoot! This soap-opera script is too much. I have to admit i had no idea what this book was about when i picked it up from the shelf. Within a few pages, i read:""Justin [...] smiled at the daughter he had sired with the exotic Chinese pirate Chang-mei, and whose freedom from the rascally Dowager Empress of China he had bought at such great expense"".And i said to myself: ""WHAAAAAATTTTT?!?!?!""I continued reading till page 120 or so, but this style of writing started to grind on me. It's one thing to make Teddy Roosevelt one of your main characters, but to give him such silly dialog is quite another.Although this book is amusing and useful in picking up ridiculously trivial factoids (did you ever know that Churchill's father contracted syphillis while a student at Oxford?), it is not worth my time when there are so many piles of books around me screaming ""Read ME!!!"""
5,"Critical Info, Told in Context","This is the best book that I've found on this subject.Lots of people are worried about ID theft. But the truth is not very many understand exactly what the crime is and how it works. This book explains both--in good detail, but also in plain English.The book is full of case studies and preventive steps you can take for reducing your risk of having your ID stolen. But it also makes the important point that preventing ID theft is mostly a matter of changing your lifestyle. Being willing to be a little difficult or uncooperative when people ask for your credit card or--more importantly--your Social Security number in everyday business transactions.Learning...and being willing...to say ""No"" is a key part of mindset you need to stay secure. This book does an excellent job of explaining that."
4,clutch for chain saw,The clutch i ordered works great. Just like the seller said it would work. It took about 15 minutes to take the old one out and put the new one in.
4,"Dry in parts, but informative","Like several ther books I've read on Sniping during wartime... there are dry parts. Perhaps I'm not enough of a die-hard history buff to appreciate all the cartridges and arms that came out during some of these wars (and hence my eyes tend to glaze over while reading about countless arms/cartridges. That being said, this is a VERY informative book and well worth a read for enthusiasts of Military sniping, or long range rifle work."
