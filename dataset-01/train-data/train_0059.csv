4,Pretty funny,"I have to say when it comes to Dana Carvey, this is one of his funniest. the dog in the movie is actually more of the highlight. A blind dog that has issues of his own, and is quite enjoyable to watch. I believe that children would enjoy this movie as well. (Mainly because there is no nudity :( and the language is pretty calm.) i would actually rate this at 3 1/2 stars, but still a fun one to check out."
3,"Good plot, but one problem: its not funny","This movie almost looks like memento ripped off of it. This guy has temporary amnesia, and the plot unfolds as the movie goes on. The plot is very well thought out and clever, revealing something new each minute, but there is one problem. This movie is supposed to be a comedy, and tries hard, but fails to deliver the laughs. There are many desperate attempts at humor in this movie, but only about 3 times does it work. But nonetheless it is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and although it wastes his talent, as one of the few movies Dana Carvey stars, and he is usually so funny, but in this movie he just doesnt deliver."
3,Fun and clever,"A clever and funny romp about a detective who's suffering short-term memory loss. Carvey plays it well, and so does the dog. The premise has him trying to make sense of the urgent goings-on around him, and is used to great effect. Don't want to ruin the plot, so just go watch it!Don't be discouraged by the three stars. I think I gave Saving Private Ryan four."
2,Interesting But Flawed Book,"The title should have been Tim Buckley Remembered; Or I Got a Lot Of Pussy in The 60's and You Didn't.....Mr. Underwood's tale of Tim Buckley's rise and fall is pretty good; however, his cheap shots at Larry Beckett take away from his tome. There is a whiff of ""I was a genius and helped create Tim Buckley"" sprinkled throughout the book. Frankly, Mr. Underwood was a very hit-or-miss guitarist. Sometimes good, sometimes great(mostly in a live setting) and sometimes horrible. As to his ""inventing"" certain guitar techniques, I think his ego may have got the best of him. I will give him this though; Tim Buckley is one of music's most fascinating ""shoulda-beens"". Some of the music that he wrote stands up with any of his 60's contemporaries and a large chunk of it is better. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to investigate Buckley's music/story; however, a grain of salt should be taken when reading it....."
4,Essential Reading for Tim Buckley Fans,"Lee Underwood's ""Blue Melody""Blue Melody: Tim Buckley Rememberedis a painstaking and highly personal recollection of singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, one of the most enigmatic musicians to emerge during the 1960s. Told from Underwood's singular perspective as Buckley's longtime sideman and collaborator, this heartfelt effort offers unique insights into the life, character, and creative processes of a gifted and staunchly independent artist. Blessed with a voice of exceptional range and rich tonality, Tim Buckley boldly crossed traditional boundaries to give us some of the most beautiful and stirring music of his era. While perhaps overly, if inescapably, subjective, Underwood has nevertheless presented a deservedly reverent narrative of the all too brief career of this talented but ultimately self-destructive personality."
5,closest you can get to the man,"I highly recommend this book for anyone familiar with Tim's music. To get the most out of the book, you should be intimately familiar with the majority of it, if not all. His life and music encapsulates so much of what was beautiful and painful about the philosophical and psychological changes of the 60s and 70s seen and heard on this deeply personal level. If you appreciate what he is trying to do and communicate, you will like a lot of his work. If not, maybe it's not for you..."
3,Adequate,"This body massager with heat does what it says, however it is very noisy. O.K. total twenty words... I like the long cord and the heat attachment, but wish it had a muffler!"
4,a good ireland rock work,"when i heard this lp for the first time i think...hey,it rocks, yeah, good rock man. this three irish people make great music middle way from therapy n'metallica, a little bit of hardcore. Great guitars n'good voices n'backing vocals. sure if you like music you like kerbdog."
2,These tapes must be old,"I bought this tape for someone and they reported to me that it played back all funny sounding, like the tape was stretching. I cannot comment about the music itself as the tape was not for me. I am not much of a music critic anyway, but the tapes must have been made a long time ago on low quality tapes since playback is junk.I would look for it on CD or some other format that will survive time better."
2,Look for better editions of Chaplin,"Please Note: This review only refers to ""Chaplin Collection by Madacy"" It sometimes appears under other titles that have the same films but it is not intended to describe those transfers.This set is boxed up very nicely. I thought that it would make a great gift. The quality of the transfer is disappointing but the worst pain is the sound! There is no attempt whatsoever to match any music to the action. If that isn't bad enough the recordings they are using have talking on them! You hear the musicians do some ... little skits about police and firemen. Obviously the individuals who created this collection didn't give the slightest effort to making it even a functionally entertaining experience. Every time the voices start it is like a train wreck to the story you are watching. They must have put this together on their coffee break. You will pay a bit more for other collections but it will be worth it!!"
1,Not worth it,"I bought this at Future Shop and was debating for about 15 minutes whether to buy it or not when I saw that it was released by Madacy Entertainment. But stupid me, I gave in and bought it. What a waste. Almost half the films are blurry and jumpy. In one film, you could not read the title cards; the wording was faded. Very bad. Luckily, I paid less for this junk at Future Shop so I'm only out 16.99. I'll invest in some better Chaplin collection in the future. Stay away from Madacy Entertainment and Reel Values Triple Feature series (another bad one)."
2,Not the 1970's I remember,"There must have been a time warp of about fifty years between North Devon and the rest of the UK if this book is to be believed. The protagonist, Samuel, behaves more like one the characters in a John Buchan novel or from Swallows and Amazons. As I read it I kept going back to the copyright page to check if it really had been written in 1974 and not 1924; which is how it felt. But it did renew my curiosity about birds of prey which had laid dormant since I saw the movie 'Kes', released in 1969 and much more in synch. with the times than this book."
2,For the Birds -- Young Birds,"Victor Canning's ""The Painted Tent"" is a so-so mystery story. Not much of a plot and the characters, although likeable, are strictly cardboard (some of them seem to a have strayed out of a Charles Dickens novel).It seems as if a quarter of the book is a diversion into the lifestyle of peregrine falcons. More about falcons than I ever wanted to know. In any case if you want to read about falcons, try the short story ""Hook"" (can't remember the author); it's better.As I was reading, I felt a odd sense of familiarity. Finally I caught on that the ""The Painted Tent"" reminds me of many of the scores of ""juvenile"" or ""young adult"" books I devoured in my early teens -- teenage protagonist, plodding mediocore plot, simplified characters, educational asides (the falcons), morality lessons, etc."
1,made in china :(,"i bought these in bulk for a animal rescue donation drive to add to my care package but am returning them IMMEDIATELY after i saw they are produced in China. i didn't realize it at the time or i would have never bought them. I don't mean to discriminate but I am still very leery of buying any pet products made in China given their extremely poor (and dangerous!) quality control. I bought all three flavors and the chicken flavor in particular gives me pause as its a bright, almost neon, yellow. There are going back asap."
5,My dog actually eats these instead of carrying them around.,"Finally, a dog treat my dog loves and consumes - historically she just carries similar chews around and ultimately I find them in the yard (sometimes buried, sometimes just in a pile). These sticks are more of treat for her than a typical long-lasting rawhide chew - which is fine with me. My dog (a mini Aussie mix of about 48bls) gobbles a chew in a few minutes and seems quite satisfied with her ""you just got home, where's my treat?"" chew. My dog's vet said these were fine in moderation - the dog is happy, the vet is content and I'm both :)UPDATE: July 22, 2012 - I purchased another pack of these a few months ago and my dog snubs them - the batch I received are much lighter in color, perhaps a recipe change? Alas, I won't purchase again simply because I now have a bag of ""things my dog like to carry around"". Back to hunting for the next yummy chew."
1,Quality dropped drastically!,"I first ordered ""Rawhide Munchy Sticks Chicken, 5"" 100 Pack Item #896"" in 2011 and my pet was delighted so ordered 3 packed in 2012 September;however my pet was not eager to eat the second order which set me wondering.On checking I realised that the quality had dropped drastically, the sticks are easily broken and my pet finds them unappetizing so I will have to dump the 3 packs of 100 each.I certainly would not be buying these again"
3,"Chicken, Peanut Butter, or Plain","My dog chooses plain first, then PB, and then the chicken. He doesn't like these as much but does eat them. He's a picky dog, so don't take this review of how all dogs will react to this product."
4,Good idea but not near as entertaining as other versions,"Got this as a replacement for the grip n grasp stroller bar that broke off on us. I like the idea that you can use one or all of the pieces at the same time and utilize your cup holders if you want but I feel like the toys are kind of boring. Was also disappointed that it didn't come with the extra elastic strapping like the other one did. I have never seen a stroller with a bar that this tiny little elastic wrap could fit around. needs extenders to use with my graco, luckily i had the ones from my other that broke."
1,waste of time,"I bought this book because I knew the people written about in the 1st story, ""The Vengeful Heart"" I expected to find an indepth accounting of what happened, with some more background information. Instead it is exactly what is already on the internet, nothing new. The other stories are just reprints from other books, most of these crimes aren't even solved. What a waste of my time and money."
1,All over the place,"This book is all over the place, now, then, what if, how do you feel, alignment of the stars, ....I actually thought this was going to be a historical account of Bents Fort with perhaps a new angle.Seems, the angle is way to steep for me. Stay away from this book at all costs....I should have read the reviews myself......"
2,Disappointing,"As an aficionado of Colorado history, I was very disappointed by this book. Do not assume that it is a conventional history of Bent's Fort, an extremely important outpost at the frontier of Manifest Destiny. It is instead a confusing and wandering psychoanalysis which purports to examine the importance of ritual. What a bore. I rarely take the time to write a bad review; but in this case it is important to warn any well meaning historian that this weak piece is not what it pretends to be."
1,Looks nice feels awful,"Like the description I thought this looks different like something Hunter s. Thompson would wear. I ordered to wear on vacation and it is paper thin and itchy even after washing. Awful experience lol. Looks better on here. save the time, and trouble."
4,Nice shirt,"The fabric is a little stiff and paper-like. No matter how many times I washed it it still doesn't get any softer. It's a really pretty shirt though so I didn't care. I used to wear it all of the time open with a tank top under it; used to get compliments all the time, and not just the back-handed kind either."
5,realy fun children's songs.,These are such cute and original children's songs. Every child should have them in their listening library.
3,Dress or nightie?,Looks nice in the picture but when I got it I thought it was a nightie!! I needed one anyways so I kept it but not the dress for you if you are looking for something more elegant.
3,a lot of bothersome texts.,there are a number of good steps but the texts shown on every step are irritating to watch and wastes a lot of time.
3,How To Murder Your Wife,"Jack Lemmon is a Matt Helm type of guy with an English Butler. He writes a comic strip and draws it from photos the Bulter takes of him acting the plot out. It's not Oscar material, but a different story line and some really funny spots. I enjoy watching it, and it is an old enough movie that you don't have to put up with dirty language."
5,This movie always make me laugh,"I've seen this movie at least 6 times. When channel surfing, this movie will win out over almost any other movie or program. The witty dialog, engaging characters and wonderful sets really make this a great movie. Watch it alone or with friends. You won't be sorry!"
5,The best sex comedy of the early 60s,"Another masterpiece written by George Axelrod (Lord Love A Duck, 7 Year Itch, Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?), this film is the penultimate sex comedy of its day. This was made when Hollywood actually made films about adults, before youth culture erased that demographic, never to return. The scenes of the war between the sexes have never been funnier, culminating in the great courtroom scene where a juror is goaded by Lemmon to push an imaginary button that would erase his wife, and the juror yelling at his wife, ""Shut up, you old bat!,"" as he gleefully pushes it. The scenes of Lemmon's bachelor pad are priceless, if only that's how comic artists really lived!This is essential viewing, next ot A Guide to the Married Man."
3,How To Murder Your Wife DVD,"This is OK but not as good as I remember it........Amazon has everything we need or want and sometimes it is nice to indulge in nostalgia. I look it up on Amazon, they have it, I buy it. Most of the time I am very pleased with my choice but sometimes a little disappointed."
4,A culturally historical document,"This very charming -- and quite funny! -- movie is not nearly as misogynistic as the title might suggest. It's basically a ""love catches up with the confirmed bachelor"" story, the kind that's been done a gazillion times by Hollywood.What sets ""How to Murder Your Wife"" apart is how it perfectly captures the fantasy of the idealized bachelor lifestyle (Playboy magazine, James Bond, etc.) of the early 1960s. Jack Lemmon plays a syndicated newspaper cartoonist who lives in a swanky Manhattan townhouse, and is aided and abetted in his adventures by his ""gentleman's gentlemen,"" the hilarious Terry-Thomas. The film is graced by a Mancini-esque, hepcat-cool music score composed by Neil Hefti; again, a perfect product of its time.For anyone who was around at the time, seeing this movie will transport you back to that still-pretty-innocent age. For anyone who came after, this'll be like an especially amusing time capsule... but very cool."
3,How to Murder Your Wife,"I don't know why I watch this movie every five years or so. I guess I used to like it. Jack Lemmon made so many great movies. I guess I should just stick to watching them. I especially love ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Great Race."""
1,Not the usual format.,I have not and will not been able to view this movie because it's on a European format. In fact it was shipped from Belgium. It was not clear on the product information that it was a foreign format. Basically I've wasted my money.
4,Losing my Mind,"Very insightful. It's difficult for the family- how to help our loved ones when they are trapped- slipping away?What can help them, how to help them, how do they relate what is happening to them, when they see nothing is 'amiss'? This book is starting to alter my 'thoughts' on what's ahead for my mother- and her family. It will be difficult, but all we can do- is be there with them. I highly recommend this for the newly diagnosed, family struggling to 'help' and 'professionals'."
4,Losing My Mind,"This book is a look at life from the viewpoint of an individual diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's and how he viewed his progression toward the final stages of the disease. It is an extremely accurate presentation of how alzheimer's slowly robs an individual of their ability to think and reason and how that impacts on the immediate family and caregivers. This review is based on my observations of my mother-in-laws progress through the disease and her passing in 1994. The final two years of her life was spent in a alzheimer's ward where she no longer recognized her own family. My wife was diagnosed with early onset alzheimers in 2002, but with proper medical follow-up and new medications the alzheimers progress was significantly slowed. ""Losing My Mind"" was a great help in knowing what to expect and how to react."
3,Losing My Mind,"We can probably all relate to this title, however, this is a road map into the mind of Thomas DeBaggio, who was a professional herb grower and journalist, and how he dealt with his journey into Alzheimers disease. It wanders a bit, as the mind does with this disease, and your heart will go out to him struggling to be his own person.This disease robs you of your person."
4,interesting reading,"This book was quite interesting, but I had read STILL ALICE first, so this didn't quite measure up to that, for ME.......but still a haunting book."
2,Fractured Meanderings,"I'm also in the minority of readers who found this book not good. I don't have Alzheimer's but I was interested in reading the book as my father dealt with dementia in the last few years of his life. The author prefaces his book by stating that he has three narrative threads--the clinical commentary, his memories, and his present day--but the pacing and weaving of the three threads is average at best. I guess this is what the mind of a demented person is supposed to be like but from the perspective of a non-demented reader, I didn't think it made for good reading."
2,Pronounced negativism,"I agree with a couple of the other reviewers in that it is hard to condemn this book since the author has an incurable disease. However, I find his endless harping on his mental condition and just how black everything is to take away from the other excellent material in the book - quotes from various other sources about the disease and its ramifications.He implies that this is the worst disease anyone could ever get. I think of Parkinson's (and Michael J. Fox), being paralyzed (and Christopher Reeve), muscular dystrophy and MS - and how all of those worsen over time. I also think about acceptance and taking action as the two people mentioned above have done. The action I see this author taking is to constantly dwell on his own decline. This is not a book I can recommend to others with the same affliction unless you can use it as a springboard to act in a different manner."
3,"You must read it, but you won't necessarily like it.","I guess that _Ender's Game_ and _Speaker for the Dead_ are tough acts to follow, but I can't help feeling let down by this book. The first half, published as _Xenocide_, was quirky but full of ideas and characterization. This one gets bogged down with the weirdness of the young Valentine and Peter, and gets caught up in mysticism while trying to postulate a physical basis for the soul. More to the point, it really doesn't tie up all the loose ends and provide closure. If anything, it ends with an obvious lead-off to a next novel, which is odd since this is supposed to be the final one.All in all, I was annoyed and unsatisfied, not so much because it was an awful book -- Card is still Card -- but because it fell short of what it needed to be. If you've read the first three, you'll want to read this one, but maybe you should contain your enthusiasm and wait for the paperback."
4,Good Final Book,"I liked this one, it is a good wrap up. maybe could have been done in 3 books but I am not an author."
4,Just under Ender's Game itself!,"I think Ender's Game could have ended after the end of that first book. I trudged through Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide and just wanted to finish the whole series. I was pleasently suprized with Children of the Mind. I was really interested if and how Jane would be saved, how the Fleet would have been stopped and so forth. This book I'd rank as #2, right after Ender's Game but the entire series is an existance in one's mind in itself."
4,"great, but not as good as Ender's Game","As some people would say that this book wasn't entertaining, I would have to agree- to a certain extent. Although I thought this book was tedious in some places, such as Xenocide, this did have many enthralling parts in it and I think that the things that happened to the characters in this book makes it worth reading. I did find the book slow in some parts but very entertaining on the whole. I gave it four stars because I am judging it against Ender's Game, and it didn't measure up to the overall depth to Ender's Game."
4,"Not his best, but then it is hard to improve this series.","This was a great climax to the best sci-fi series ever. I have only one real complaint, and that is that the series had to end at all. This book was typical Card, with a fast beginning, and a mind boggling ending. Though I did enjoy the other books in this series more, this was still a great book. Most authors can only dream that one of their series can be as invigorating and imaginative as this one."
2,sorta entertaining,"""Ender's Game"", like so many others who have written here, is my all-time fave sci-fi book. Obviously, most of us have caught up to the fact that Card was determined to ""right"" the capsized-ship of morality. Card was successful in this book, but his success came at the expense of our fave character Ender. I don't agree that Ender's childhood decisions based on self-preservation were selfish signs of cowardice. The constant chatter between the piggy trees and buggers was sorta irritating at the end. Personally, I would've liked to see Ender return to earth with his family and swim in that lake he and val floated on way back when."
3,Picks up where Xenocide left off,"""Children of the Mind"" is the final book in Orson Scott Card's Ender Quartet. It picks up right where ""Xenocide"" left off, and is the logical conclusion to Ender's story, wrapping things up in a satisfying enough manner.Like the books that preceded it, ""Children of the Mind"" is largely character driven, and this is certainly one of its strengths. Few of the characters are explored in excrutiating detail, but Card gives us just enough of a glimpse into their lives and personalities to give the reader the feeling that we know these people.While the book is certainly satisfying in that it ties up all the threads woven in the previous books, I feel that it is the weakest of the series. I'm not sure that much would have been lost if it had simply been compressed and included as the final chapters to ""Xenocide"". That said, if you are a fan of the series, and particularly if you have read ""Xenocide"", then ""Children of the Mind"" is a must read."
1,Only for those in absolute need of resolution,"I never thought I would say this about a book in this series, but I hate this book. I was absolutely disappointed with the way Card chose to resolve his story. I'll give him license since he may do what he will with his story, but I feel so bitter about this ending to such a magnificent saga that I can't recommend this to anybody that isn't dying of curiousity at the end of ""Xenocide"".And to those who believe you fit in this category, I'm sorry for the feelings you will like possess upon completion. I honestly feel the same unrest now as I did when I finished ""Xenocide"". I hope everyday that Card will come to his senses and revise his plot here to be more logical, less rushed, more conclusive (which some may argue with), and more fulfilling to a character of such quality as Ender Wiggin."
1,Should never have been written,"I highly recommend NOT reading this book, which managed to diminish the magic of Ender's Game for me. Stop at Xenocide, which was pretty good, and skip straight to Ender's Shadow, which is VERY good. This book is exceedingly disjointed, makes way too much of the Valentine/Peter dichotomy, and is boring, boring, boring. Where I couldn't put the other Ender books down, I had to really struggle to finish this one. And then wished I hadn't."
4,"Ender's saga comes full circle marvelously in ""COTM""","The people I know who've read the book seem rather split; some felt it was rushed or contrived, while others felt it was a spectacular payoff with many welcome, unexpected twists. Count me part of the latter group.CHILDREN OF THE MIND successfully marries the breakneck pace of the original Ender novel with the slower, more developed storytelling of SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD and XENOCIDE. I felt Card rather ingeniously connected many (if not all) of the loose threads in ways not only unexpected but clever (and I surmise he'd had the threads sorted out all along). All characters achieved satisfying closure, and it featured some of the more inventive action sequences I'd read in some time. Ignore the naysayers and dive in. A fine read."
3,Mind Game,"I admit it. I liked Ender's Game. Unfortunately I didn't like Children of the Mind. I read enough science fiction that confusing me with abstract concepts is pretty tough, but this book rose to the challenge and far exceeded it. Writing was good, characters where good, even some of the story was good, but whenever they started talking about switching bodies and the aiua I felt like I was swimming in a sea of confusion."
2,"Orson, Orson, Come In Orson","The Ender Saga, which began with two of the greatest novelsin all of science fiction literature, wobbles to a close inthis anemic volume. As Mr. Card's ego grows (read theembarrassing afterword in which he concludes that he is oneof the few great writers in America today) his writing withers.Perhaps he is spending too much time in his virtual ""town"" onAOL. Certainly the writing has the rushed, abbreviated toneof an e-mail post, and what he passes off as wit in this booksounds less like Wilde or Coward, and more like it came froma chat room."
2,Inconsistent with Xenocide!,"Ok, I just started on this book...but I noticed several ERRORS immediately!!!! FIRST: It says Jane will ""die"" once all the networked computers of the hundred worlds is turned off. WRONG! in Xenocide it says Jane WILL LIVE even without the computers, but she will be mentally crippled. SECOND: It says there are dozens of FTL starships now in use. HOW CAN THAT BE? In Xenocide it was clearly established that Jane can only take a ship OUTSIDE and back INSIDE IF...IF either Ender or the duplicate Peter or the duplicate Val were inside it! So how can there be ""dozens of FTL starships in operation""???!!!!!! Ender has vowed never to go OUTSIDE again. That leaves the duplicates of Peter and Val. So how is it that suddenly dozens of FTL starships are in use????? What is Orson Scott Card thinking? Has he forgotten what he wrote in Xenocide?"
1,A Book that should not have been written,"It's sad to see the Ender saga fizzle away in ever-increasing complexities and meta-physics which are not substitutes for new concepts and plot directions. Sometimes when you have painted yourself into a corner it's better to jump out a window and forget the little bit that is left to tidy up. I feel that it is at least two books (""Children"" and ""Shadow"") past the point that this series should have been left to stand on its undoubted early merit."
3,"Good book, strange plot","As usual, Card delivers with great writing and relatable characters. But the plot of Children of the Mind was just a little too out there for me to take it seriously.This book is hardly about Ender AT ALL. Or, it is if you count the fact that his soul divided and made two new characters, which were really old characters, one of which is still alive, so there are really two of them, only... well, it got pretty wierd. All the conciousness-swapping made the book rather unrealistic. I did, however, enjoy the God-Whisperings of Gloriously Bright.In short, this was a good book with a far-fetched plot. The ending was very solid, though-- and the book was a definite page-turner."
3,Not as good as the rest of the series,"Ender's Game and Speaker were fabulous books. This book is not as good.Honestly, I recommend skipping it and going onto the Ender's Shadow series, which is excellent."
5,This was a great book.,"When I first started reading the series with Ender's Game, I was blown away. That book was one of the best I have ever read. Speaker for the Dead was another strong book, though it wasn't as good as Ender's Game. Then came Xenocide, I was incredibly bored throughout the entire book, it had its good moments, but they couldn't make up for the rest of the book. I still wanted to read Children of the Mind because I wanted to finish the series. I was pleasantly surprised when I read it. I believe that it was a strong ending to an overall excellent series."
2,WHAT mind??,"OK, I got over the fact that Ender had a cameo and then died. But I couldn't get over the lack of good hard science (like Speaker for the Dead's explanation of how piggies reproduced). What in the world is an aiua, anyway? Novinha had undergone a sorry change from the intriguing, pivotal character she used to be, and the new characters introduced were more blah than the Brady Bunch. Grace Drinker (couldn't find a better last name?) and her husband who laughs all the time were ludicrous. If there really was a Jane, she'd be rolling over in her ansible network"
2,Weak ending to a great series,"I was disappointed with this fourth (and presumably final) installment of the Ender saga. Indeed, this story isn't really about Ender at all but about the 2 Ender ""clones"", Peter and Valentine. While this does not make this a bad novel, frankly, I was hoping that Card would have found a way to make the demise of Andrew Wiggen, one of the more interesting protagonists in science fiction, more memorable. Wiggen's death is reduced to almost a footnote in this installment and I could never generate the same degree of interest in either Peter or the young Valentine"
3,"Good book, but disappointing conclusion to Ender series","As with most of Card's books I found this a very interesting book to read. But at the end of the book I was disappointed. I felt that I would have enjoyed the book a lot more if Ender was not one of the main characters. You fall in love with Ender in Ender's Game and you want to see him put his harrowing experience at Battle School behind him, but you miss the happiest years of his life in this series because we are watching Valentine in space. When he gets back together with his wife, instead of being happy he is ""bored to death"". And the book ends without really dealing with the descolada issue. The reincarnations of Peter and Valentine were interesting, but they really seemed ill-fitting to the rest of the plot. I am finding Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow much more worthwhile reads."
3,Let's go back to battle school,"Ender's Game: 10, Speaker For the Dead: 9, Zenocide: 7, Children of The Mind: 5A lot of useless self-absorbed inner turmoil and ridiculous pseudo-science in this one. Doesn't have the hard, bitter edge that made Ender's Game so great. These characters bask annoyingly in repentance and unconscionably benevolent gestures toward humanity. And they preach too much--to each other, to themselves, and therefore to me. It seems as though Card went a little overboard with his latest attempt to teach us to be decent to one another, and in the process forgot to entertain us with plausible scenarios. The parallel to modern-day earth he attempts to portray through absurdly homogeneous ethnic worlds is simplistic, hardly a subtle or elegant allegory. But man, was Ender's Game good.Take us back to battle school. Please."
2,This book is not hard to put down,"I'm a big fan of Card's and think his Ender series is great, but Childred of the Mind just isn't very interesting. It's rambling and lack just about everything that's good in the other books in the series. The other books in the series are well told, full of imagery and interesting ideas and twists, and one develops empathy with his characters. His editors should have reminded Card of what makes him a good writer. Perhaps Card is starting to write above mortals like me, or perhaps he's getting a bit weird on us. I'd suggest skipping this book and trying something else he's written"
1,Excruciating,"This is by far the weakest of the Ender series. It could easily be cut in half with the loss of absolutely nothing. It is verbose in the basest sense. The dialogue is repetitive in the sense of ideas. Why take one sentence when you can drone on for a whole chapter? Card seems unable to simply be satisfied in making his point, or illustrating an idea. He just repeats the same ideas, the same concepts and the same one dimensional character personalities over, and over and over again. The conflicts are contrived and the solutions simplistic and predictable. Arrrggghh! It took me over two weeks to wade through this book because it bored me so much!It is as if Card merged the WORST of Camus, Dostoevsky and Asmiov-- Unending descriptions of introspective character musings by simpletons obsessing about themselves in a futuristic setting."
1,Bored to death. Just like Ender.,"Ender's Game is a great book. Speaker for the Dead is a good book with some great new concepts. Xenocide and CotM are truly awful with CotM being so bad it is painful to read. And it sets up the reader for yet another sequel. Oh. Please. No.In CotM, Ender just withers on the vine. In the end, he literally bores himself to death. He must have been reading this book.Ender's Game readers will want to read the entire ""quartet"". Do so if you must, but be aware that life is short and you will never get these hours back. Do yourself a favor, pretend Xenocide and CotM do not exist and read the Shadow series if you need more in the Ender world."
2,I big disappointment with a lot of loop holes,"Ender's Game= great, Speaker for the dead- good, Xenocid= GREAT, but Children of the mind=poor. Card in his last book of the Ender ""quartet"" just reies to juggle to many themes and eventually just loses himself and ends up with a heaped up plot. The book is left wide open open the issue of the new species, the descoladores, who made the virus. Though this is the last of the ENDER books, Card should write ONE last novel to tie up all the lose ends like the issue of Jane, Peter & wang-mu, Starways Congress's response to hearing the descolada netralized, and they should be alerted about the descoladores! The next book should mainly be about the descoladores. THERE SHOULD BE A NEXT BOOK TO CLOSE THE HOLES."
2,An irritating slog,"Like most ever other reviewer here, I read the entire Ender's series up through this book. While Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are outstanding books (five star worthy), Xenocide and Children of the Mind are simply irritating. I despised all the characters, who were so self-centered and so completely flawed you have no connection to them to care whether they die or live, and can't conceive they could succeed at anything. Page after page of characters contemplating their relationships with the other characters makes for a very boring read, and I found myself skimming much of the book. *spoiler* Without Ender, who essentially withdrawls from the narrative to have a relationship with his angry-at-the-world wife, there are simply no sympathetic or interesting characters that you really care about. But hey, at least I read all four books."
3,Almost as Good,"Ender's Game will forever be the king of this series, the best there is to offer. Nevertheless, this book holds its own against the heavyweight competiton."
2,As bad as Xenocide,"I loved Game, Shadow & Speaker. However, I will never understand what people see in Xenocide or this book. The dialog, plot & characters became more & more ridiculous throughout each of these two novels. By the end, I really didn't even care what happened to the characters I had grown to like in previous books.My advice is to avoid Xenocide and Children like Descolada ! And if you don't get that reference, just avoid them because you will be more lost than human in a Bugger cavern ..."
1,....,"Wow. All those Islamic terrorists trying to destroy America apparently don't realize that all you have to do to overthrow a superpower is bounce around a bit. Sounds ridiculous? That's not even half as ridiculous as this piece of...well, this mistake.The end of Xenocide was bad enough, when we learned that all your problems can be solved just by traveling to the magic dimension. Now, only a few weeks have past and not only have our heroes discovered a new race of alien species, but Jane--now a goddess-- has figured out that she was never really going to die anyway because she has the power to take over someone's body. Ender is boring himself to death, and Dark Peter and Wang-Mu are hopping around looking for random people to preach to. We are introduced to a new character: the Admiral of the Lusitania Fleet, who is quite clearly retarded.Children of the Mind...you fail!"
5,Almost as good as the original,"Card did an excellent job in re-writing the Ender's Game story from Bean's point of view. It compliments Ender's Game quite nicely. It fills in what may be considered some voids in the initial story as well as lending a very different view of the battle school, Ender and the armies. A very good read!"
5,Can't get enough,Orson Scott Card is my hero. How he can continue his Ender story to completely new worlds and not lose the reader is an amazing feat. I am moving on to the parallel stories of Ender's Shadow. I will be heart broken when that series is done. No really. I will be heart broken...
2,"i gave up and didn't even finish it. but i still heart card. now, on to bean's story!","i love love LOVED book one. it was exciting, it was deep, i laughed, i cried. book 2 was kind of surprising, but i found it very profound and thought provoking. made me look at life differently, and somehow made me more precise in my communications. i foresee myself reading books 1 and 2 again and again throughout my life. book 3 started getting tedious, but i was still very curious about the characters and how everything would work out. book 4, i just didn't care. it was a struggle to keep returning to the book and trudge along. eventually i just gave up. at around page 215 or so, i put the book down and just read the summary on wikipedia. it was so unnecessary and pointless. but i still love the author and will keep on reading the rest of his books. this book was just awful. i'm glad i didn't waste any more time on this one. but i can't wait to start bean's story now!"
3,The series was brilliant but sagged by the end.,"I greatly enjoyed Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. The writing was wonderful, the characterization was excellent, and the plot was interesting and detailed. The first half or so of Xenocide was also wonderful, and the Godspoken of Path were intriguing characters. But by the end of Xenocide, I became disappointed, and Children of the Mind did little to change that. The philotes plot seemed silly (was he just trying to rescue himself after writing himself into a corner with the Lusitania Fleet?) The characters sagged. The new characters were two dimensional in their basic definition, and the book seemed just a forum to air his strange science twists. Even science fiction should still be based on characters and plot, not science or philosophy."
3,Space Soap Opera,"I thought Children of the Mind was kind of boring and disconnected. And why did Ender have to die and go into another person. That soul/body stuff really got boring after while. The one thing that makes this book worth reading is the quotes the characters make and the philosophy stuff at the beginning of each chapter. If you are interested in Card's best though, read Ender's Game or Lost Boys."
1,Card should have quit while he was ahead !,He misses the mark on almost all counts. The charecterization sucks and the plot *feels* manufactured. The growth of Ender Wiggin from a child to the speaker for the dead has been dealt with beautifuly in his earlier books but the entwining of ALL threads into this story is frankly unacceptable.In fact I even see traces of Alvin in Children of ..
5,GREAT ENDING TO THE BEST SCI-FI SAGA EVER WRITTEN,"""Jane closed her eyes, smiled, and then all four of them were gone. Only the mothertree remained in the center of the clearing, bathed in light, heavy with fruit, festooned with blossoms, a perpetual celebrant to the ancient mystery of life"" I write this last paragraph of ""Children of the Mind"" from memory as I felt it was worth it to memorize the ending to the greatest SCI-FI saga ever written. This book ending the ""Ender's Saga"" is a masterpiece of writing. The characters are rich and full of life both good and bad. The morale battles waged are gripping and thought provoking. I recommend without any reservations that anyone who loves to read a well written story that they buy all the books in the series and pass them on to friends, family and loved ones as you will be giving them a gift of more than just words on a page but a gift of what life is all about."
3,the last drop,"Mr. Card had a great plot for the first book of this series. I really enjoyed that one. While Children of the Mind has some interesting ideas and insights, it is neither as powerful nor as captivating."
1,just awful,"This was probably the most disappointing and tedious book I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was because I am a fan of the series and I have never put a book down halfway through. Card repeats himself to the point that it feels like he is beating you over the head with a hammer with his ""philosophical"" ramblings. I would estimate that 80% of this book is dialogue about characters' feelings that reads like one person's inner monologue. It is mind numbing and I seriously became agitated at points because I knew I should just cut my losses and quit reading. If you are a fan of the series and just have to know what happens next I would just do yourself a favor and read some cliff notes or read a summary on wikipedia. So little happens that it is unlikely you would miss much. You would at least save yourself the misery of reading this drivel."
4,Excellent Conclusion,"Wonderfully wraps up the Ender stories. With the interesting twist on old characters brought into the new story, there are a lot of strange feelings. Card brings everything from each book together and fills all of the voids in this wonderful conclusion ""Children of the Mind."""
1,Hello I read this delightful book,Hello I read this delightful book abot the fairies and the unicorns that take over the world by means of illegal weapons!!!!!! THIS IS A GREAT NON- FICTION BOOK!!!!
3,Ehhhh...,"Okay, Ender's game. An action packed book, very exciting and very entertaining. Then, Speaker for the Dead. Great book, good plotline, not as exciting, but good. The only flaws in these two books were the cliffhanger endings, which led to the drivel Xenocide and Children of the Mind. These two books are quite ridicolous, Ender and Co. have long talks bickering with each other and talking about ""philotes"" and ""Inside and Outide"", which all make absolutely no sense at all, and how much they all hate each other and love each other. Theres a lot of complaining too. After a while, they just get really boring, you know? I think Card should have ended the books with Speaker for the Dead. With each book, the series declines more and more. Rent this book from the library, otherwise, don't spend the money. Wait for a new Series of Unfortunate Events to come out."
2,wood grains,"My main comment is, if you want to be reading about tracing wood grains, you'll enjoy this book. You actually go through the pain of this tedious job. I really got the point at the first wood grain tracing session, but then there was another... and another...That's pretty much all I can remember about the story, seeing as I read it as a child. If you want to finish the series, as I always do no matter what, then you are in for some pain. Hey, if you finish it, you'll have the satisfaction of reading ALL the Ender books! Otherwise, forget it and read ""Ender's Shadow"", that's a masterpiece right there!"
2,not worth reading,"My time would have been much better spent re-reading the first three wonderful books in this series than trudging through this corny, tedious anticlimax."
2,Too many miracles....,"Children of the Mind read similarly to the stories I wrote in 2nd grade. Though more sophisticated, it had the same rambling tone, as if the author didn't quite know where to take it, and wrote the story while searching for a way out. In doing so, the story became too unbelievable, to be enjoyable. There were too many miracles, too many near deaths, too many almost destructions. Every time Card couldn't think of a way to get himself out of a tight situation, a new ""miracle of science"" was discovered, making the story a winding tale. The question is raised: Is it fair to give a lightsaber to a man facing lions?The ending left you hanging, but I, for one, have no desire to learn or read more. I have a feeling this was not meant as the end of a series, but the beginning of a new saga. A saga that may draw in others, but will continue to destroy the perfection of the original, Ender's Game"
5,Children of theMind,"A+, It's a gotta have for the Sci-Fi Officianado.The ""Ender Saga"" opens your eyes to human frailties, romance and Adventure. Card is a genius at Techno Speak of the future, and the Wiggin future is presented in a reality that will make you crave more. If you enjoy cutting edge science, Quantum Physics and a real belly laugh, Children of the Mind will keep you turning pages.Pain and Peace, Fear and Foreboding, Love and Laughter, Orson Scott Card is a master and this is NOT the end!"
5,One of my all-time favorite books!,"This book is nothing like the rest of the entire series. It's more phenomenal. :) This is one book many people say they don't like, but frankly, it's one of my favorite. I read a LOT of books - all sorts of books, but I make time to read this one at least 2ce a year. Yep - it's that good."
2,A disappointment after Xenocide,"Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--""Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?"", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars. Just keep in mind that while it says two, it means three."
2,Card went too far,"Orson Scott Card went too far with this one. I felt he was pulling at strings to tie all of his books and the universe together in a cohesive work. He spun a web and got caught in it.Ok, no more metaphors. This book is the conclusion of Ender Wiggin, with his final acts and battles. This book gathers many of the characters from his previous books, and attempts to solve all of the universes problems through the acts of a few incredibly bright, isolated, tortured, souls. With a convenient, all knowing, almost all powerful being to help out, it's no surprise that our protagonists succeed in their tasks. It's a must read if you're a fan of Card, but far below the quality of the previous books in the series."
3,too metaphysical,"The author reaches a little too far in this sequel to Enders series and also changes pace and type of book from others in series. This demonstrates the remarkable skill and expertise of the author with ability to write several different styles of story. But it can be confusing and perhaps disappointing for those looking for more of the same in the series. This book is Ok, but it is almost a different genre than others in Ender series and not as much fun for those who are fans. As a standalone book it is just ""OK"" although it creates some images that may leave you pondering after you finish the book, the ""fun"" level is lower."
2,Disappointing and silly.,"Disappointing book, silly finale, characters that all the same and have no distinguishing personalities whatsoever. I don't know why I keep reading Card's book, but at least I'm finally done with this ridiculous series."
3,Metaphysical,"This was less sci-fi, and more a fantasy experiment in metaphysics. FTL via metaphysical transport; soul-splitting; computers becoming human. There's probably room for a sequel, but the author moved on years ago, and he wrote this a few years after the previous installment."
2,Dont give up!,"I found Children of the mind to be long on dialog (much of it redundant) and short on story. I would have preferred to see the last 10% of Children of the mind appended on to Xenocide and a new book four detailing experiences with the new alien species.But this is not the point of my review, I wanted to let others like me to know not to give up. I was ready to forgo reading any of the Shadow books. Fortunately I had already bought Enders Shadow for my Kindle and was obligated to read it (after all I already paid for it!). And I am glad I did, it was a much better read and almost as good as Enders Game!Moral of the story... Dont give up!"
4,A good closing to the series,"Although it was not a GREAT read, it was a GOOD read. I tire of all the reviews complaining of Ender's death, and the ""lack"" of hard science (namely the ""auia's) in this book. This is science-fiction folks. Stop complaining about what can be, and starting opening your mind to what could be. Although the ending was a bit blunt, and abrubt, I think the book is a good ending to a fabulous series. Keep up the good work Orson."
2,Completes the downward spiral of Ender begun in Xenocide,"Card's preaching in his most recent works (see Pastwatch) has precluded character development. Ender Wiggins becomes a one-dimensional character even if you include the ""personalities"" of young Val and Peter. The rest of the characters fare even worse. The plot progresses at a glacial pace until the last few pages and the resolution is only sleight of hand.After the disappointment of Xenocide, I hoped for a return to the vitality of Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. What we got was more ""magic"" solutions to problems faced by whining, self-absorbed characters. (Yes, I'm aware that technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced, but there were too many rabbits pulled from the same hat to generate a coherent, much less enjoyable, story.) Even though I am a fan of Card's work, I can't recommend this book to anyone other than an unrepentent SciFi diehard (or similarly afflicted ramen)"
2,More soap opera than science fiction,"There is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much dialogue - both inner and outer - in this book. A planet with its inhabitants is about to be destroyed and we are misguidedly treated to endless useless and boring details about the love lives and inner demons of many characters. And pointless verbal sparring and pedantry.The stuff about the aiuas was interesting at first, but it doesn't seem to make any sense. Why can't young Valentine hold herself together? She has her own self inhabiting her body, no matter the forced ruminations about the topic. This should have been an obvious flaw from the outset. And that Jane cannot seem to find better solutions to being shut down by Congress is hard to believe."
2,Read just to see the ending... not much else here.,"This book had sadly little new... It just seems to be a rehash of Xenocide, and a drawn out one at that. I loved Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, but since then he's gone downhill with this series. As well, a significant portion of this book could have been left out, with little or no damage to the plot. Perhaps Card's status has resulted in editors being unwilling to alter his manuscripts... He should've spent his time making the Ender's Game script (yes yes yes!)."
1,Card does it again,"How can you go from Ender's game to this?!? I almost tore my eyes out when reading it. If you like boring characters talking about the same things over and over and over and over and over... and over, be my guest. Young Val is specially boring and annoying. The only redeeming quality is that there in not as much crying and weeping as in the last two books.You could probably write a fifteen page summary and miss NOTHING!!!"
3,Tying up loose ends,"In Children of the Mind, Orson Scott Card wraps up the Ender's Gamer series. That's what this book is basically for. Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead can stand on their own but Xenocide (the third book) and Children are for those who enjoyed the first two books and want to see the story to the end. Not to be too harsh on the very readable book but little is new. The ending is satisfying but no more. I would recommend the book to those who love Card and want the complete Ender's Game story."
2,Things kind of got crazy...,...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
3,"Good, but still disapointing","This book is undenaiably a good book. That being said, it was still a trementous disapointment. I have read and adored the other books in the series, and after finishing Xenocide I was expecting somthing just a wonderful. This book was not it. I feel that Card has beglected his characters and beautiful ethical dilemmias for a plot that, while interesting, was not spectacular. The book is frusterating to read, with favorite characters dissapearing, and with inconsistencies with the earlier books. I would recommend this book to anybody who has read the series simply because it resolves the earlier books, but I wouldn't really recommend it for its own sake."
3,Mixed Bag of Old and New Versions,"This CD seems to be a combination of old and new versions of some of B.J's great songs. B.J. Thomas has an incredible voice when at his best, and had the knack of selecting wonderfully melodic songs with great lyrics, especially throughout the 60s and 70s. Unfortunately the new recordings on this CD lack the energy and sincerity of his originals, both in terms of B.J's vocal performances, and in regard to the arrangements. Why you would want to change such gems as this man's originals of"
2,Bad Trip--- Not the Original Hit Song Arrangements,"These are NOT the original tracks that we all heard on the radio. They sound like primitive rehearsal tracks with marginal singing, bad orchestration,and different arrangements.Do Not Buy This CD --- or on second thought, please buy mine.Forrest"
2,B J Thomas: 22 Classic Tracks,"""B J Thomas. 22 Classic Tracks "" I was disappointed in this albumn. I bought it for the pop songs BJ did years ago that I always liked. But these are re-recordings and I don't think he did nearly as good a job of singing them. I like the old recordings much better. I can't recommend this recording."
3,B J Thomas 22 Classic Hits - about half qualify,"Having heard various B J Thomas tracks on radio over the years and liked them I thought it time I bought a CD. I chose the one with the most tracks that I had previously heard/enjoyed although there were others which I hoped I would also like. Unfortunately this wasn't the case and I would regard about half of the 22 tracks as not very memorable. However, the sound quality was excellent and at the price paid it worked out about $1 per track that I liked and I regard this as good value."
2,Bad ending,"Talia and her friends have started the Thrill club. They meet regularly to listen to the scary stories Talia has written. But when she starts using the names of her friends in her stories, things go badly. A friend is killed in a similar way.It was an okay storyline, but the ending was way too far out for my taste."
3,thrill club,"The book is called Thrill Club and the author is R.L. Stine. I am in the 8th grade. I'm fourteen years old. I think you should be about thirteen years old to read this book. Thrill club is about a group of kids that have a club where they tell scary stories. Then, the stories start coming true. Then at the end they figure out who did it. I liked the book for the most part. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't say what happened to the characters. I lked the story line. They should put more charactors in the story. I think you should read this story."
4,the thrill club,"This story is about a girl named Talia,her friends ,and a club ""The Thrill Club"". They tell storys at every meeting and soon Taila's storys start coming true and all her friends start to doubt her. This story is really exciting so you should go and pick it up at your local bookstore!"
4,Audrey S. review,"I though that this was a very good book and I liked it. It was a little confusing because you think that a girl named Talia killed her friends, but Talia's boyfriend was controlling her mind. So he killed his friends. However, it was still a good book.A group of five friends make up a club called the Thrill Club. What the Thrill Club does is: each week they have a meeting at one of their houses and someone reads a horror story that he or she wrote. When Talia reads the story her boyfriend wrote for her, it always comes true. So two of her friends end up dieing just like in the story.I would recommend this book someone who likes to read horror stories. I think only a few parts of this book were scary. Whenever she reads a horror story that her boyfriend wrote for her it came true right after she read the story!"
4,make sure you can really use this,"Fine product, but be aware that it allows only 60 degree opening of the lid. Might be a problem for hope chests or toy boxes."
3,Not for small bathrooms or bath towels,"Bought this towel rack to coordinate with my Bancroft faucet.Unfortunately it did not work as I had planned. It sticks out 5-6 inches from thewall so if you have a small bathroom it gets in the way. Also, the back rack sits tooclose to the wall to accommodate a thick bath towel. This towel bar would be best usedfor thin hand towels in a large bathroom."
5,An Excellent Introduction to Social Security,"This is a fantastic overview of the American social security dilemma. The author covers all the major themes, ideas, and concerns of this pivotal issue in a clear and engaging format. I have read many social security tomes, and I can tell you that this is the best I have yet to encounter. In a mere two hours of reading you will become an informed citizen of this terribly misinformed topic. Mr. Shemtob, I salute you!"
4,My children loved this one!,"I cannot say what it was about this book that captured my children's attention, but they really liked this book. It was a bit old-fashioned, and it gave a good glimpse into a child's daily life in China long ago. My children were in kindergarten and first grade when I read this to them."
1,I DIDN'T PAY TO SEE IT AND STILL SHUT IT OFF,"I watched this film on a video for academy award consideration. Even for free I wouldn't watch it. I was ready to shut it off after ten minutes, but I love movies and am extremely adept at suspending disbelief and will give anything a chance. BUT, after 40 minutes I couldn't take anymore. Adam Sandler did a wonderful job of portraying a pathetic psychopath.However, you could not feel any sympathy for him as the character development in this film for any of the sub-characters is completely non-existent. This is a common complaint from snobs about soap opera (And I agree!) however, at least soap opera is intended to entertain and it does. It's just that no one expects it to be art. The critics that are raving over this film need to go back and re-read ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" If there was ever a prime example, this is it. I spent no money and sat in my sweats and I still want my 40 minutes back!"
1,Completely AWFUL,I saw this in a packed theater. We all got suckered. I was stuck in the middle seat of my aisle and couldn't escape. I dreaded every minute.
1,One of the worst movies I ever saw,"The people in front of us walked out. We stayed to the bitter, and I do mean bitter end, hoping (as Adam Sandler fans would) that it HAD to get better. This movie is advertised as having ""black humor"" but it had no humor with the exception of a few chuckles here and there AND the plot was dreadful...utterly stupid.I felt the same way when I watched Mulholland Drive...and my husband said he felt the same way watching Sleepy Hollow. If there was a zero rating---I would give it that."
1,Pathetic,"Adam Sandler does a good job of playing a deeply repressed individual who is prone to bouts of violence and crying jags. Unfortunately, this is not funny. The voluptuous Emily Watson portrays a seemingly nice and normal woman who is inexplicably attracted to this pathetically pathetic individual. (see the recurring theme here?)The filmmakers seem to be shooting for some kind of Coen-esque story line, but what one gets is a confused mish-mash of scenes that never really come together, yet nevertheless culminate in a Hollywood ending that tells us ""Since he's found love, all the neuroses, denial and depression he's spent a lifetime accumulating will now magically go away"".Who really cares, anyway?I want my $ and two hours back."
1,Hated it!!!,"My husband and I made it through about 20 mins. of this movie. I knew that it wasn't going to be the usual Adam Sandler movie, but this was just ridiculous. It was so boring and didn't seem to get to a point. I couldn't care or even be curious about any of the characters in the film. Maybe there is some hidden meaning that I just didn't see, but I'm not going to watch it again to find out! Rent it or get it from the library, it's not worth buying."
1,I dont get it...,"This movie was terrible. I understand that Sandler wasnt trying to be funny in this one, but it made absolutely no sense. It kind of reminded me of a Cheech and Chong flick when they justad libbed an entire movie. Dont bother."
3,Sleeper that needs a few more hours rest...,"OK- I am a PT Anderson Fan. OK- I am a film fan. OK- I am a fan of artsy movies. But I was not a fan of Punch Drunk Love.Here, we have an example of a great director trying to be someone he's not; is he a victim of the masses who expect something a slight bit on the quirky side? or was he going for the ""art film"" look in every shot just because he could?Either way, it does not succeed in my book. I've loved PT Anderson's films up until this point, but with this one, it seemed like he was trying too hard to impress the audience and give them (us) something new. For me, it didn't work. It MAY have worked with a first time director trying to find his/her style, but not a vet who already has both a mainstream AND a cult following. This one tried too hard to satisfy that cult following- and this member of that cult saw right through the artsy stuff and wondered why he chose to do something that's so obviously ""fake.""Sadly, 6/10"
1,not his best work,"I am a big Adam Sandler fan but, this wasn't a favorite of mine. Watched the whole movie and then I wondered why. I understand what was being protrayed...it was just a long and boring way to do it. Was very sorry I bought this movie. Big waste of $15.00. Have loaned it out to other and they have all had the same reaction to this movie. Good luck if you buy it."
1,Didn't Get It,It just seemed like the director was trying to make some artsy-fartsy movie and failed.
5,The guy above doesnt know what he's talking about....,"yes there are scenes where slience is heard for a long period of time and yes wierd things do happen throughout the movie but it all has a point. directors just dont put these random scenes in movies cause they think it's cool they do it to express their emotions, thoughts, and creative self within. this movie is really amazing. i hate adam sandler with a passion in most of his movies but he pulled a fast one and i love it. go rent/buy it now!"
3,Creates a state of mind although lacks a story,"I think my title says it all. If you've ever been stalked by someone (ala Cape Fear) you can understand one of the states this movie will offer. The other involves some oddities of mind from someone who has obvious childhood issues. The best part for me was when he fights back. What a shift of character when he had the love interest. The overwhelming fear was replaced by anger or courage, that was almost inspirational. There wasn't much story but the movie was more about Adam Sandler's character."
5,Quirkiness Abound,"Paul Thomas Anderson continues to impress me with his films. This is in stark contrast to his three prior films (Hard Eight (Special Edition),Boogie Nights (New Line Platinum Series),Magnolia (New Line Platinum Series)). This film only features two main characters. Adam Sandler does a wonderful job playing the neurotic Barry.It's a love story, in one of the most unconventional ways. Barry almost won't let himself love. ANd it's a wonderful film watching him actually get there.The two disc set includes scopitones, artwork, deleted scenes, and a few other things. It's quite worth a watch.Highly recommended."
5,pta's writing,"I would just like to point out that Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest living story-tellers. The review on Amazon that says the writing sucks could not be further from the truth. Give this one a try. One of the greatest romantic comedies of all time that pushes the limits of the genre in comfortable ways (as it should be with RomComs). If I had one movie to take with me after I leave Earth, it would be Punch Drunk Love. Could watch it over and over and never get tired of it, always find something new I missed before."
3,"Finally, a ""real"" movie. Adam Sandler, Luis Guzman.","Intelligent man has good luck in front of him and bad luck in front of him. All in one morning, strange things begin to happen. But he can handle himself very well. However, he would like someone to talk to because he doesn't feel himself sometimes. He says he feels like crying sometimes. The next morning gets even worse. Oh, the pressure...the stress...My God what else can happen. Well it does. Watch this film to find out. Another strange film by ""Boogie Nights"" Paul Thomas Anderson. Luis Guzman, one of my favorite actors, is clean-shaven in this one. Disc 2 contains over 12 minutes of deleted scenes and other stuff. Shown in wide-screen."
2,Weak,"Sure, it's deep, imagery is wild, amusing at times. But it just isn't entertaining, and unless you like ""weird"" movies that really have no rhyme or reason (those are most independent film fans) this just isn't very entertaining. A movie most will forget the next day, and NO I don't care for the average Hollywood movie fodder either. It's reality, but we watch movies to escape reality - they warned me at the movie store, and after seeing it, and understanding it - I just didn't enjoy it. It's one I'm glad I didn't spend $... to see in a theater. As you'll see by the reviews, you'll either really dig it, or hate it. I thought it was just weird."
2,Not worth the time.,"I think this movie deserves two stars because some of the cinematography is wonderful and because the soundtrack is great and effective. Unfortunately, the movie lacks in character motivation, script, and plot in general. This fits in with so many so-called art films I've seen that seem to be little more than average stories with a few superficial character quirks thrown in."
1,Either You Love It Or You Hate It,"I hated this movie. When we were done with it, my friend and I were both like, ""What did we just watch?"" PT Anderson dropped the ball on this one - he tried to be too arty with the minutes of nothing but colour splotches on the screen and he didn't pull it off. It made for a disjointed movie, with a weak script. The acting was fine, but Sandler and company really didn't have a lot to work with as far as a script was concerned, and the whole thing just comes off as pretentious and mired in its own self-importance. In all, this movie was a total drag to sit through and it's a definite low-point in Anderson's otherwise magnificent canon."
1,Arty pretensions do not make art...,"This film is a pretentious mess. It is full of obscure arty little distractions that make no sense and get no explanation as to their relevance to the plot. Adam Sandler is his usual terrible self; he's not funny in comedies, nor is he convincing in a 'drama', if that's what you can call this. Even the pace, the feel, and the warmth of the film changes abruptly from scene to scene as though the director couldn't make up his mind what kind of film he was making. What he ended up making is one of the worst films I've ever seen."
1,Major Disappointment,This movie was a major disappointment coming from Paul Thomas Anderson. I loved Boogie Nights and Magnolia but this movie was really bad. I saw it at the theater with 5 other people and we all left scratching our heads and wanting our money back.
1,"Wish there was a ""0 Stars"" Button","Wow....what a waste of Adam Sandler's considerable talent. As a diehard Sandler fan, I can safely say that when I saw this 'film' I decided it was time to stab my eyes out with a rusty fork. Fortunately, someone nearby took pity on me and turned the DVD player off, sparing me my sanity and my eyesight. Poor Sandler. This must have been a hard blow; while he did great with what he was given for a script, the movie itself packed no PUNCH, blew chunks like a DRUNK, and I would LOVE to ask whoever's idea that was, ""Just what in the hell were you thinking?! How am I supposed to get that two wasted hours of my life back?!"""
2,Punch Drunk Love,"Are you people nuts? This movie was bloody mediocre at best, and P.T. Anderson is the most overrated filmmaker alive. He fancies himself an incredibly deep artiste, but Thomas Hardy he ain't; Magnolia, for the most part, had the depth of an afternoon soap opera and Punch Drunk Love is even worse. Granted, the guy has some visual flair, but he really needs to go the Martin Scorsese route and get other people to write his scripts for him. Punch Drunk Love is just further proof of how narratively and intellectually deficient his writing is. Some good ideas are wasted in a rambling collage of cinematic non sequitirs, and the harmonium representing Sandler's character at last finding inner harmony(harmonium, harmony, get it?) has to be the most trite metaphor I've seen in a long time. P.T. Anderson, and Wes Anderson for that matter, need to learn that shallow quirkiness does not a great film make."
1,This was the worst movie ever!!!!!!,"I am usually a very positive person, and I love Adam Sandler, so I was excited to see ""Punch Drunk Love"". The best part of the movie was the credits because I was finally able to tell myself that the pain and torture I had endured for the last 90 min was finally over. Everything about this movie [was bad], and there were at least 20 or 30 events in the movie that had absolutely nothing to do with the film. This is a perfect example of why we need to get the drugs out of hollywood because anybody who approved the script was obviously high on something more then life. By all means rent this movie, or buy it of you would like to take a nice nap, but I would much rather see a KPBS special where the cast of the Power Rangers, Barney, and telletubbies get together to talk about crossing the street. I only gave this movie 1 star because there was no lower rating. had I been able to take away stars that other people gave, I would have done so."
4,Tennessee?,""" This is the worst movie I have ever seen, May 19, 2003Reviewer: A viewer from Tennessee USAThis movie was the worst experience I have ever had in my life. Please do not spend any money to see this movie. You will surely regret it for all of your days""The above reviewer is from Tennessee...do we have to say any more? In the words of Bill Hicks, ""In many parts of our troubled world people are yelling 'Revolution, Revolution!' In Tennessee they yell 'Evolution, Evolution!...we want our thumbs!'"
2,no case,I was under the impression that the movie would have a case due to the picture of the case. It came in a burned cd holder! The movie still works fine so it isn't that important but i would rather have it in a case.
1,A waste of life!!!,"They make you enter at least one star otherwise I wouldn't have given it any. It's a sad state of affairs when a worthless movie like this is produced. I watched it twice just in case I missed something. I didn't. Loaned it to a friend who couldn't stay awake for it. My son, an Adam Sandler fan, thought it grueling to watch. I don't understand these other reviews. I suppose it's either a love it or hate it type of movie. Frankly, I don't think Adam Sandler is that powerful an actor that he can afford to make a movie like this that alienates so many viewers. He owes me my [$$$] rental fee back."
1,Disapointed,"This was supposed to be a two-disc special edition, but somehow I only ended up with one disc inside the box. I was bummed because I wanted to watch the special features."
1,Did we watch the same movie?,I found Punch Drunk Love to be too bizarre and random and ultimately it was just so boring. People keep saying what a great film this is and I just don't understand that sentiment. I felt this was akin to staring at a blank wall for 2 hours. How is that entertaining?
5,Sweet,"Something about this film really intrigued me. Maybe it was because I saw myself as the main charecter in a way, totally hopeless and lost, until he finds a beautiful, sweet girl who loves him. I've never been in love, I wouldn't know, but that's my guess, something about this movie opened up something in me that I've forgotten since I was 10. Anyways, Paul Thomas Anderson has made a film that almost anyone can relate to in one way or another, unless you've been happy for every second of your life, but I don't think that has happened to many people. This is one of those movies you can watch when you lose someone or something in you life which ment a lot to you, it reminds a person that happiness is a state of mind, nothing more"
1,What's the Point??,"It is amazing films of this sort get Green lit in Hollywood. It is a plodding bore that I would not recommend to anyone, very pretentious, so don't waste your time unless you are convinced that you will like anything Paul Thomas Anderson might crank out."
1,What is this????,"Everyone once in a while, I choose to rent movies that I haven't heard of before, out of curiosity, but I have to admit, I screen the actors' names before, which gives me some sense of ""how bad can it be?"" For example, I have yet to be dissapointed with a movie that I hadn't heard before which had actors such as Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Meg Ryan, Al pacino....Until this one, Adam Sandler also fell in that category of ""if he chose to play it, it must be ok"". WRONG!!!! I am a strong beleiver that actors should play different roles in their careers, but in this case, it looks like Adam Sandler's thought process was merely to say ""I always do comedies, this is different, so yes I will do it.""!!It's one of those movies that you wait, and you wait, because you beleive there HAS to be something that will eventually make sense, and then it ends, and you are right where you started, NOWHERE!!To conclude, don't rent it, loss of money, and more importantly, loss of time!!!"
5,i liked it,"it's funny, i mean how people can be smart but be so stupid. they have an excellent understanding of lexis and can express it wonderfully but they can't grasp other concepts like, well the name of the title is punch drunk love, right? so well does it have to be so rational as to why things happen? and sometimes the best things in life can't be explained right? if someone loves me i don't have to question why they just do and the same when i love someone else. and it just seems like the random acts of violence is just a visual cue for these unexplainable phenomenon's . i don't know maybe i'm just looking for water an empty well. but i really liked it."
1,one of the worst movies i've watched,"i just don't get it. i thought this was terrible. it was boring, uncomprehendable, dull, slow paced. i was wondering if this movie was made as a joke. i watched it for less than 30 mins then left the room (was at a friend's house). adam sandler is not that attractive to look at. maybe if it had a handsome guy or beautiful girl in it i could have watched it more."
3,It's OK,"What was great about this movie, Nothing. If you want a comedy don't waste your time. The only thing this movie had was the ability to keep my attention. So in conclusion I would wait until this movie is on TNT or something. Do waste your money!!!"
3,This was supposed to be a big breakthrough,"This was widely billed as Adam Sander's big break through from a his usual role as a dumb funny good hearted village idiot/bumbler (waterboy, big daddy). However hard as I tried I saw no difference from any old Adam Sandler movie. As these movies go this was as good as any but it was not different in any fundamental way. Adam Sandler played ... a dumb funny bumbling village idiot who had a good heart. If you were a fan of Sandler's you will love this movie if you hated his stuff before you will not like this one either."
3,ADAM SANDLER'S FUNNIEST MOVIE IN A WHILE,"THIS STRANGE COMEDY CHRONICLES A STRANGE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SMALL-TIME BUSINESSMAN [ADAM SANDLER] AND A WOMAN THAT WAS INTRODUCED TO HIM BY HIS SISTER. I GOTTA ADMIT, THIS IS PROBABLY ADAM SANDLER'S FUNNIEST FILM IN YEARS. THERE ARE SOME FUNNY MOMENTS, BUT LET'S FACE IT, SOME OF IT'S ALSO STUPID. HOWEVER, IT DEFINITELY EXCEEDED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. AN ACCEPTABLE RUNNING TIME AND ENOUGH HUMOR MAKES THIS RATE AS AN ACCEPTABLE MOVIE."
1,One word: Awful,"If you are a fan of Vanilla Sky starring Tom Cruise then Punch Drunk Love is for you! These two movies should be thrown into a vault and never spoke of again. Adam Sandler is a great actor, but this movie makes him to be the worst. I have no idea why he would choose to do this role because it is completely meaningless. If you do choose to watch this movie be sure to have a blanket and pillow ready because you will be bored and exhausted from the confusion of the entire show."
1,the worst of adam sandler,"im a huge fan of adam but this movie blows. i sat through the movie to see if something good happens at least in the end, but i was wrong worst movie i ever saw peformed by adam sandleradam you could do better roleslove ya"
1,Very bad movie,"This movie is classified as ""Comedy and Romance,"" but there was no comedy at all. It was only a collection of unrelated fights, car accidents, and weird scenes; in addition to the loud meaningless sound effects. I did not get the point of the story, neither did the people who walked out early -- they were a lot. I regretted that I didn't leave and kept hoping that there will be some meaning at the end. Adam Sandler was fine as an actor, but if he kept playing this kind of weak stories, he will lose his popularity."
1,Not an enjoyable movie expeirence,Sorry Folks but I found this movie excruciatingly painful to watch & extremely boring.
1,my first movie review,"This is the first movie review I have ever written. I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire. Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung.. .. I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate! No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back... Hurry, go see it!!"
1,Yuck!!!,"If you haven't gone to see this, don't bother. We left the theater wondering what happened in the first scene. There was no title sequence, the movie just *started*. One second we're watching a trailer for J.Lo's new movie, the next second, Adam Sandler is sitting at a desk, talking to someone on the phone. It's just... bizarre. From funky camera angles, to blurry colors that swirl through the middle of scenes, to music that is so loud you can't hear the dialogue, to dialogue that consists of hate and meanness.... It just beats you up one side and down the other.Not worth it. Not funny. Barely scratches into ""sweet"" before being covered over with ""ickiness"". *shudder*"
5,Punch-Drunk Love,"Punch-Drunk Love, Paul Thomas Anderson's fourth film, is a diversion for the writer/director of Sydney, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia, but do not be fooled. Anyone who mistakes this film as an ""Adam Sandler movie"" or just a weird, romantic comedy is completely missing the point. PT Anderson has crafted a masterpiece - through his script, camera movement, and Robert Elswitt's stunning cinematography - that challenges the idea of love and our perception of love. Watch the deleted scenes and ""Blossoms and Blood"", the featurette. Watch. The movie is not what it seems....there is more going on underneath the surface... If you don't like this movie it's a shame, because you're missing out on the genius of my generation's greatest filmmaker and you're definitely missing out on the fun."
5,"Exaggerated, but true nonetheless","So many people grow up to be emotionally stunted, keeping nearly all their anger and pain inside, only to release it in inappropriate ways. Few of us go so far as to destroy a restaurant men's room when we do it, but many of us understand that misplaced rage. I certainly identified with Barry Eagan, and the supression he suffered, the rage he fought with, and that constant effort to be a nice guy; and I found the film moving for that reason.If you've ever felt alone, or like no one cared about what you had to say or what you felt, I have a strong suspicion that this movie will make an impression."
4,Hold on to your seat!,"I have not seen a better movie depicting what it's like to be inside the mind of a clinically depressed person. Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) is restless, strung out, neurotic, desperate, and numb. And you are along for the ride on his emotional roller coaster. This beautiful, feeling film is NOT for jocks looking for a funny Adam Sandler movie. Furthermore, the background score is so on key with his emotions, that your nerves will be shot by the end of the movie. Emily Watson is wonderfully passionate and unusual, and Adam Sandler can no longer be viewed as strictly a comedian. Highly recommended for someone looking for a quirky, neurotic, quasi love story."
3,"An off-beat, feel-bad romantic comedy.","An off-beat, feel-bad romantic comedy. While Adam Sandler is perfect for his role, the vibe of the film is like a downer episode of Cops - if Cops were scored with grating arty circus music."
1,Don't Bother,"How anyone could think this movie was anything but complete garbage was beyond me.I guess a lot of these reviewers are extremely ""deep."""
2,Not Worth Watching -spoilers-,"This movie is a bore! And kind of annoying!It's not a romance/comedy! Drama...er...a little? Not a lot.Alright, the story itself is good. Plot is terrific, characters alright. Acting is great.The constant music through-out the movie was just annoying. The camera angles and shadow shots were just irritating. The only character that wasn't a complete Mary-Sue (or one-dimensional) was the main character, Barry.This could have been a great movie if it wasn't for the script, the shooting style, and the annoying background music."
4,Sandler's best.,Sandler is great. Sometimes distrubing and funny at the same time. Great acting and a great script.
2,hated this movie,"Adam Sandler is known for his comedy movies. Some have been better than others. I have no objection to typecast actors trying for something different, and if Adam Sandler wanted to try a serious role, then I support him fully. However, this movie failed. It had no real story, it went nowhere, and I found myself bored through the whole thing."
5,AWESOME,"First off, if you are going to watch this movie because you are a fan of Adam Sandler movies, then don't waste your time, on the other hand, if you enjoy films, (not hollywood driven movies), then you will love this. The direction is amazing. also, the score fits the movie well. Because of the score and the direction together, you can get a feeling of what Sandler's character is going through during certain scenes. You can get an uneasy feeling when he is freaking out about stuff, and you get a emotional feeling when he falls in love with his girl. I suggest renting it first because this film is not for everybody, then buy it if you enjoyed it. I hope my review helped out."
5,A Tremendous Performance,"Adam Sandler gives a quirky, unsettling and absolutely fascinating performance. No, he doesn't belch, spit up milk or assault Bob Barker on a golf course. It is the complete opposite of what we percieve him to be, and I've never seen a more assured, interesting take on a character from anyone...Nicholson, Pacino and Spacey included. He gives unusual life and breadth to P.T. Anderson's simple, sweet story of love and belonging. This film wasn't about being ""artsy"", and anyone who didn't get it has obviously been too brain addled by Hollywwod's simplistic, cliched way of telling the same story over and over again to understand anything outside of the mainstream. A fresh, interesting, funny slice of an unusual life. Bravo!"
2,Hardly enjoyable,"I rented Punch-Drunk Love with the expectation of seeing a beautiful, artistic, and meaningful film that I could treasure and watch over-and-over again.I found little to be treasured.Certainly, the cinematography was lovely, the eerie soundtrack suited the movie's mood perfectly, the actors (for the most part) performed their roles very well, but otherwise...Nothing about the movie held me. The complexities of the life of a man with various mental disorders do not interest me (when presented without any particular purpose or meaning). The love story between Sandler and his love-interest did not catch my interest either.I feel that this film has no binding point of interest. I'd pass on it if I were you."
2,"An Attempt to Make the Simple, Complex","As a fan of highly stylized and unique films, I was looking forward to seeing Punch-Drunk Love. I must admit I was extremely disappointed. After watching it again - and watching all the ""extras"" on the DVD, I have concluded the film makers KNEW they had a very basic and boring story, and the only way to make it more interesting was to thow in other things like the strange artwork and unexplained elements in the film like the piano.Adding all of these ""artsy"" elements might make people think the film was much more than it was - a very basic story. Unfortunately - it doesn't work.To its benefit, the film is very interesting visually, and the music works well throughout."
1,Worst Movie EVER,"This movie sticks in my head. Not because it was wonderful, because it was THAT BAD. I don't mind odd. My tastes can even run to the quirky, but this was just dull, boring, confusing, stupid, horrible etc etc etc. I felt like punching myself for sitting through this foul movie!!"
2,"The more I think about it, the less I like it.","This movie is no good... No character development, no amazing story, a very terrible ending, very annoying and loud music. Adam Sandler does well in this movie - I like him in this. But, Emily Watson is terrible...and the sisters in the movie are so annoying. I have a hard time watching this movie. I dont really like Paul Thomas Anderson anyway. I mean I'm into original movies ...[but]I hate movies like that. But I just think P.T. Anderson's movies are just pretentious and boring. He's trying to be too indie. I just don't like this movie...Adam Sandler does good in this movie but thats about all there is good to it. I'm not gonna tell you not to watch it because maybe you need to see for yourself and actually think about this movie. Really ask yourself if it was good. Too many of the little indie kids are like oh man this is the greatest ever. So yea..I'm done."
1,"Not Sandlers Best, in fact, his worst.","When I purchased this movie, I was under the impression that any film with Adam Sandler would fulfill my entertainment desires. Alas, i was highly mortified by the extremely horrifying display on my television set. The film was not only dark and disturbing, but the soundtrack was erratic, irritating, and a failed attempt at being artistic. This film is a tragedy; a complete insult to socially inept people. The only positive in this situation, is that Adam Sandler was able to emerge from this film with his career still intact. Please reconsider purchasing (or even simply viewing) this film. If you still feel the need to purchase a new DVD (I myself am an avid film collector), I suggest Old School (starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell). Now THAT is a fine film."
1,Pointless,Plain and simple - this movie was one of Sandlers worst! There was no real plot - it was jumpy - horrible script. I was really disappointed and I do not recommend anyone to waste their money to even rent it let alone buy it!!
1,I only ask... what in the hell is this?,"From what I'd heard this was supposed to be a comedy... I found nothing comical about it... it started out fine but the constant drumming sounds and the horrid plot were enough to drive anyone to insanity. By the end of the film myself and another I was watching it with were about ready to break the TV, it seemed to just grind our nerves with the constant drumming over and over again.The plotine is horrible, it got to the end and it's like ""WHAT?!"" THis is just terrible... if you have a high bloodpressure, do NOT watch this film, it WILL give you a higher one believe me.Worst Adam Sandler film ever, it made me almost think twice about seeing Anger Management a few days ago. Sandler is great, but this is a waste of money, time and will definately cause some unwanted stress. Save yourself the stress and trouble and get another sandler film instead."
2,"I hope they used the word ""comedy"" loosely...","I sat through the whole movie, and I didn't really see the appeal of it. There were a few things I thought were funny, but mostly the entire movie just felt drab and lifeless. Adam Sandler gave an excellent performance; really, all the performances were very good, but that doesn't help to breathe any life into this off-the-wall nod to mentally unstable people who still manage to lead fairly normal lives. I'm not even entirely happy that I watched it, I'm kind of vaguely wishing for my hour and a half back, and I don't do that very often. I guess this kind of movie just isn't my thing."
4,"Sweet, feel-good movie","When this appeared in cinemas I ignored it, simply because it starred Adam Sandler, so I thought it was another mindless slapstick comedy. (I did like ""The Wedding Singer"" though). Subsequently I discovered that it is a romantic-drama, and, as I discovered while watching the DVD, a very good one. A major detour for Adam Sandler, as he plays a serious character, and does so admirably. He plays a weird socially-awkward guy whose life seems sad and meaningless until he meets a woman with similar weirdnesses to his.There is someone for everyone. The notion is not original, but this exploration of it certainly is."
5,Punch Drunk Love,"This movie is one of my favorites because you walk away from it with the largest smile on your face, yet if you were to explain it to someone, they'd ask why on earth you're smiling. I know that sounds cryptic, but if you enjoy human emotion and it's fickle nature, then go see this movie. Watch it without knowing anything about the movie. Don't expect any one thing and you will be happily surprised that this movie has everything.If you want something to be glaringly funny, telling you when to laugh and when to smile, please don't see this movie. You have to think for yourself and not let a director's set-up tell you when a funny part is coming up. In short, this is one of the greatest, most awkwardly beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's everything that life encompasses: fear, love, anger, unfair bullies and redemption, anxiousness, and eccentricities."
1,Worst movie ever,After 15mins of watching this abortion. I went back to the store and demanded my money back. they gave me my money back and agreed on how bad it was.
1,A plain stupid movie,"...this movie classified as ""Comedy and Romance."" As a matter of fact, there was no comedy or romance. Only a collection of unrelated scenes of fights and craziness, in addition to loud annoying meaningless sound effects. I did not get the point neither did the people who left the theater early -- they were a lot. I regretted I didn't leave and kept hoping that there will be a point at the end. Adam Sandler was fine as an actor, but if he kept playing this kind of weak stories, he would go down."
1,Waste of time and money,"I just saw ""Punch Drunk Love."" It is awful. It is stupid. It is not funny. None of the characters are endearing. Emily Watson is miscast. It is plotless, violent, and there are about 1 and a half laughs (I really only laughed when the brother-in-law said he was a dentist, not a doctor.) This is not a romantic comedy. In short, it is a waste of time."
1,Punch-Drunk Love,"What a complete and total waste of 95 minutes of my life, not including the money I spent purchasing this DVD. I have always been an Adam Sandler fan, but there was not one scene worth watching in this movie. And for everyone to say how great it is, doesn't have a clue what a great movie should be. Save your time and money, you will thank me for being the only person truthful enough to state it the way it really is!"
2,"Huh? Adam Sandler kept me watching, only because of him","So I am watching this movie and thinking the direction is pretty weird, but I am sure some of you indie lovers, love this weird stuff. I am more of a blockbuster movie type of gal although I feel that I do know how to appreciate a good indie.This movie does not qualify on my list of good indies, maybe worst indies would be more like it.The movie is so slow, the story is so-so and the end makes you feel like you wasted your freaking time.Adam Sandler is great as always, I love him and thatw as the only reason why I rented this picture. He didn't cut it enough to make this a god movie.Bottom line: If you like his other films, don't rent this just because of that reason. This is totally something different. Like people reviewing this movie (who liked it) said, Magnolia is just like this. I hated that and didn't like this."
1,Two hours of my life I cannot get back,"I went with a friend to see this movie and we were not at all impressed with it. The story was so BLAH - it felt like nothing happened the entire movie. We finally decided we had enough and got up to leave and the credits started to to roll. There was no beginning, middle and end to this film."
2,Punch Drunk Studio,"It looks like it's going to be an art movie when it begins, and then maybe a slick Cohen flick, but it turns out to be neither.While there are a couple of cute scenes, it's mostly a painful flick to sit through. Save your money and time."
1,Wow! Too boring for words!,"As a big Adam Sandler fan, my DH thought this would be a hoot! Not so! After the first 30 boring minutes, I heard the deep rumble of his resounding snores from across the room.They woke me up."
2,Didn't get it,"What in the world is the point of all of these strange goings on? What is the point of the harmonium, the truck crashing down the street in the beginning, all of those weird rainbow colors flashing on the screen, and the banging clanking music? There is no point! It just shows you what happens when 1 person has too much control, and writes, directs and produces a flick. Please get an editor! I liked Hard Eight, but this movie just sucks.."
1,"Sad, sad, movie","I love quirky and insightful movies. I watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SPANISH PRISONER, GLEN GARY GLENROSS, and all the rest and enjoy them over and over, relishing in the twists and turns and messages that these movies dispense. But, I'm not going to slap kudos on PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. This move is as disturbing as it is sad. The violence is not enjoyable. It was nothing like the trailers portrayed it to be and I will not recommend it to anyone."
1,punch drunk love,"This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Adam sandler is the ony reason i kept watching. No plot, No real story to the characters. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,An odd and wonderful film,"I'll preface my review by saying that I loved Boogie Nights and hated Magnolia. So I'm not exactly a PT Anderson fan, but I do appreciate his talent.From what I read about this movie, I was expecting something offbeat, but it turned out to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not everyone will get it and not everyone will enjoy it, but that's often true of great films.It may take a dark sense of humor to enjoy the movie, as I often found myself to be the only one laughing at parts of the movie.The best way to sum up this film is to say that I was smiling from beginning to end and can't wait to see it again!"
5,The Craziest Most Beautiful Movie In A Long Time,"A great example of a film that was able to combine a weird dramatic tension with a crazy emotional tension: laughter/crying at the same time. Crazy dialogue and situations that logically shouldn't work, but do in the most amazing way. The best American film since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr."
1,The Stupidist Movie of all Time,"This is one of the most stupid, pointless movies I've seen in a long, long time. I think that Adam Sandler ought to stick to his comedy movies. Obviously it's the only thing he's good at. Emily Watson is a total disaster."
2,Punch Drunk Love,I found the movie a bit slow and boring; not as funny or entertaining as I expected.I wasn't a fan.
2,"Interesting, but WAY to confusing.","I am not one to say I dislike a lot of movies, but this one was way to confussing. There was no charecter development, there was no plot, and there was little story. I still have no idea what this movie was supposed to be about. From what little I understand this man is very introverted, but when some bothers him he breaks things. He meets a girl and loves her. Beyond that everything else is too weird. I gave this movie two stars because it looks at life in a new sort of way. I wish I could have givin it a better review but I just can't"
4,Loved the Thanos toy,This a very strong and durable toy. My son loves it. He has been battling Thanos and Hulk since Christmas!
1,Very Disappointed,"Once again I must write a review stating that I am disappointed with the condition of the book I recieved. It had spots, stains and pages that were folded,I did not expect to see since it was stated that the book was like new. The seller mygrandmagoodies informed me that if I took my bad review off the site that I would recieve another book to my liking,that was October 10th it is now November 24th and I have yet to recieve replacement book. So to my fellow readers PURCHASE WISELY!!!"
3,Good Read,"I did enjoy the stories by Rochelle, Donna & Brenda, however, I felt that Francis has a little catching up to do. I personally felt that the story by Francis Ray just sort of dragged on and on and not up to par with her past books. Leo's is a good read, but watch out for Francis in this one..."
4,Words are inadequate,"I paraphrase Joan le Barbara from the liner notes - really there are no words that can describe how important this CD could become to you. Palestine, in a feat of almost supernatural endurance, repeats only two notes (?) the whole piece, but alters their sound using the pedals and his attack/rhythm, sustaining an hour long drone that changes perpetually, and beautifully. You may never get past the first thirty minutes - how often do you get to listen to anything for longer than that? - but once you get to twenty minutes you'll be ready to testify that you've only ever listened to one kind of music all your life - strumming music."
5,Good Product,"This clipper set seems to work very well for what I need it to do. I use it to keep my head shaved and I wanted something that would work better than what you can get at wal-mart, which is what I was using. It shaves very close and has an adjustable lever to change the closeness. I have cut myself once using it, operator error. The only gripe I would have is that it is very loud and heats up pretty quickly."
2,loud and itchy,"Compared to the generic clippers I've been using for the past several years, the Baldfader did cut a little closer to the scalp, though it's definitely still a ""crew cut"" and not a what I'd call a ""shave."" A bigger concern is that the unit I received is *extremely* loud, to the point of making my ears ring. I wouldn't consider using this in my apartment at night - would upset the neighbors. Last but not least, the Baldfader irritated my scalp, which the previous clippers did not.Summary: I'll probably keep these around as an emergency backup, but I consider it money wasted."
2,Very Uneven Collection of Self-Indulgent Poems,"Reading clearly has talent, but it lies in the realm of the succenct haiku-like cryptogram. Many of these poems are first-draft indulgences, collected in a helter-skelter manner. This book would clearly not have been published in America, nor could it have gotten past many of the poetry manuscript contests here. Reading is best at keeping his mouth shut (""Alert!"", a poem several pages in length should have never been written, let alone published) and his thoughts mysterious. And if there is a failure here, it's in Reading's lack of an editor (an editor who is also a ruthless critic). Every writer needs one, Reading more than most."
4,What Happened To These Guys????,"I own all three Val Gardena CD's. At least that's all that I am aware of. Most of them are now unavailable. I bought this one before I ever heard any songs. This is basically a combination of new age, classical, and jazz. Their CD's are some of the most relaxing music that I have in my collection. I kept two of their CD's on my 5 disc CD player for months. All of the songs are good in their own way. Come to think of it I have never heard a bad song by Val Gardena. What happened to these guys????"
4,Beautiful but fragile,Wife loved the ring. Very pretty. Great color. Careful - fragile. Unfortunately the ring shattered when she smacked a table top. (Not out of anger.)
4,Great turquoise color ring,What a great band ring! Wear it often and like the smooth feel and intense color.Lots of fun for a low price.
3,Turquoise ring,I like my black gemstone ring and order the turquoise one for a friend.They liked it...
1,Avoid at all costs!,"Avoid the Sony STR-DG710 receiver at all costs! I owned it for 2 days before returning it. The promo literature says ""Optimized for Blu-ray Disc"", and that is an outright lie! I bought it for my PS3 for Blu-ray playback because my old Sony receiver only had digital optical audio input, and optical is limited to only 2 channel PCM. Well, guess what? The HDMI audio on this receiver is limited to only 2 channel PCM. Dud! You need to go with at least the DG810 to get 5.1 PCM audio. After a Sony tech rep told me that, I returned the DG710 and bought an Onkyo. Avoid!"
1,My third POS Sony...,"The left rear surround died after 2 years soon followed by both front speakers. Complicated setup, heat sensitive. Give it a pass. This is my third and last Sony product I will ever buy. I've got a '70s era Pioneer in the shop that runs forever, I think I'll give them a shot this time."
2,poor circuitery,"I purchased this Sony product with plans to connect a Blu-Ray to it. After speaking with the Sony customer tech suuport, I was told that the HDMI connections could not be used for either of the input-outputs because I have to hook it into my tv using a HDMI to DVI adapter. The Sony circuits would not support this type of connection, and would have to use a component type of connection. The unit is still sitting in the box.I purchased a Blue-Ray dvd player and it arrived yesterday. Needless to say, I did not purchase a Sony. I connected it directly into my TV using the HDMI to DVI adapter and had no problem. Sony needs to use a little more forethought when designing a product."
2,"Great, but no sound","I purchased this unit because of its reasonable price and HDMI capability. After replacing my existing receiver, I found that the front left and right channels and one of the rear channels had no output. After returning the unit and purchasing a replacement (of the same model), I am well pleased. The set up was a snap. The automatic sound balancing worked perfectly. The HDMI works flawlessly. Once I got a working unit everything is good."
1,VERY GOOD EQUIPMENT,"It is a very good equipment, easy to use and sincronize with the Sony Bravia TV LCD, but I received this equipment in bad condition, I am an Amazon's customer for year, and it is the first time I recived the product in not good condition.... Please be carefuly with the packing and transportation you asign."
1,Poor manufacturing by Sony,This unit has chronic failure of the left channel.I have had 2 units and both have exhibited the exact same problem. The left main channel arrived dead out of the box. I tried swapping speakers and wiring left to right - no change. I did everything Sony on-line and phone line suggested and nothing worked. Both the local Sony repair agent and Sony repair in Texas said 3 to 4 weeks to fix it. If there were a rating of zero I would have used that instead of 1.
3,OK receiver,"Overall it is good receiver with OK performance. Reason not liking or loving it is there are functions that are not available from the ads.Does not video up converting from video in to components out (I know it does not do component to HDMI, but from the ads, it says video up converting, meaning to components)Does not decode Dolby EX and DTS-EX on my LoR DVD."
3,"Good Points, But Too Simple","This book has some very good points, but it's more motivational than anything else. The examples seem very extreme and are given without much detail. Most of the methods seem overly simplified and lack clarity, others are quite vague. This does not seem like a great book for learning about investing, but it does get you really excited about real estate! It makes for a great introduction into the field as it compels readers to learn more."
4,Something to See,"I have not read this book yet but I plan to. I visited Seven Oaks in the late 60's. It had already began to crumble with the roof having fallen in along the front. But, oh, how magnificent she was with her huge columns standing proud and defiant! You could almost hear the darkies singing as the Master, with his family, sat on the upper veranda in the late eve and watched the steamboats pass by on the mighty Miss. What a treasure lost!I have now read the book! I stand by my original review. What a magnificent mansion it was."
2,Don't Bother,"We were wanting something to make us laugh. They Went That A Way & That A Way was so unbearable. We didn't even watch the other movie, this one was that bad."
5,Oh Snap!,"Hey, don't miss out on this great dvd. I like the longshot and I have not seen the other Tim Conway movie but I'm guessing it will be great. The longshot is one of my favorite movies and is absolutely funny! Even if you haven't seen this movie or any Tim Conway movies, you will enjoy this great dvd!"
2,OK movies,"The movie ""They Went That-A-Way"" was so corny. Tim Conway is a really funny guy, but shouldn't write scripts for movies. Some parts of this movie were slow. I would never prob watch this one again.The ""Longshot"" was better with Harvey Korman and Tim Conway teamed up in this one with Jack Weston. Most of this one funny, but some parts could have been left out. These two movies are not for children to watch anyway."
1,Dont waste your money,"I bought this because I really enjoyed ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"". I was desapointed...greatly! The humor is weard and not funny...and the stories are boring...really boring."
2,Good thing it's two for one,"Tim Conway is more classic in the T-W-T-A-W & T-A-W than in the Longshot. Neither my brother, mother nor myself watching the Longshot enjoyed it. There are long stretches to get a half-a-chuckle. As a matter of fact, the movie just seemed long period. The team work of Conway and Korman never gets off the ground like we are used to like the Carol Brunette show. Tim wrote and produced this one, but didn't deliver the funnies. You'll find a few more laughs in T & T."
3,Where is the rest of the show??,"I just received this disc, and was incredibly disappointed to see that it is NOT the entire show. In fact, it's not even close! I was at the concert, and was really looking forward to seeing it again. I think that the way this is being sold is somewhat misleading. There was more broadcast on CMT than there is on this disc! It's almost not worth the money...."
3,Great DVD...if you're not looking for Dave Matthews,"I just received the DVD in the mail and was a bit disappointed. I read a customers review who was at the concert and he stated that the Dave Matthews Acoustic performance was worth the money alone. I ordered the video largely to see Dave perform his hour plus acoustic performance. Needless to say, it was only two songs by the time it reached the DVD. If you like the other artists, it's a good DVD. If you're looking for Dave Matthews, don't bother."
5,"A ""desert island"" favorite","I just took delivery of my third copy of ""Family Garden,"" having lost the previous two to car vandals. The break-ins were December 1999 and May 2002. The point of this post is to inform you that I've carried this CD with me for years; that's how I lost it twice.It's one of my favorite albums, period. I have a significant John McCutcheon collection, but ""Family Garden"" touches me above all others. Here's the punch line: I am single, no kids. I'm also a huge fan of ""What It's Like"" so believe me, I get John McCutcheon on all fronts.So...for what it's worth, I had this CD with me, and lost it, in 1999 and in 2002. But I have it again, with good reason. My favorite cuts are the title cut, ""Baseball On The Block,"" ""Happy Adoption Day,"" ""Dad's Got That Look,"" ""Is My Family,"" and well, it's all good. I hope you and your family enjoy it as much as I do."
3,This book is all about the pictures illustrated.,"The story is in the art. The line about the cat is repeated from page to page. Cute pictures with repeating phrase. The phrase is stated on each page. When you turn the page you will see the phrase. Each page, same phrase."
4,"Beautiful Illustrations, inspiring creation","This almost wordless book is a collaborative effort, and the story of that collaboration is half the joy of the book. Great illustrations lead a child to tell the story, which has a surprise happy twist ending. Better daytime reading than bedtime reading, since there isn't much to actually read. As always with Frank Asch, a huge hit for very visual children or young artists!"
4,Required Reading,The book is great for the purpose I bought it for. There is a lot of of technical information in the book. I would recommend this book to the student that has or is taking Health Care Administration.
5,Best I've Seen,Ordering from Amazon.com was the best choice I made. I didn't even have a chance to wonder about my order. It was almost as if they shipped it out the moment I submitted my order. Great service and perfect condition.
4,Continuous Quality,What can I say...it's a text book. Yes it has valuable information and at times can be a heavy read!
3,this hammock...,it's ok... but I'm not sure if it will survive and provide good service reliably on my next rip to the amazon jungle... looking for other options as I write this...
1,Uselessly small,"Even my 5' girlfriend didn't fit in this narrow hammock, much less me at 6'. More trouble than it's worth to return it -- I used the ropes as extenders for another hammock. Don't buy this, you will be disappointed. Might be okay for a toddler."
1,Stiff,"I watched for about 15 minutes and was turned off by the poor acting and script. The noir atmosphere was poorly executed as well, really just confused the scene instead of adding to it."
2,Not so good,"Bad, It really couldn't catch my attention. So so acting and not so good effects. The plot has been overdone."
2,let me down,When I saw the previews for this movie it looked very interesting to look at. Was I wrong or what. It goes to show that not all previews are always good.
3,the drunken irishman says>>,"SO HERE WE GO AGAIN MORE CHEAP STRAIGHT TO DVD RUBISH.... YES .... NO ITS BAD, THIS I GRANT BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT ITS PRETTY STYLISH BRAZIL.. ESK WITH THE TECH, AND ANY OLD POST APOCH..BACK DROPS. WOODBINE IS BAD THERES NO AVOIDING THAT. HES ALMOST AS BAD AS THE PANTHER BUT IF YOU LIKE ATMOSPHERIC AND CHILL PILL COOL CAMERA YOU WONT WISH YOU WERE DEAD WHEN YOU WATCH IT. ALL IN ALL FOR VAMPIRE FANS OR HIGHLANDER THE SEREIS FANS YOU SHOULD PROBABLY WATCH THIS IT DOES NOT SUCK ... BUT ITS OK"
4,Original take on vampires!,"As a collector of B vampire movies, this instantly hit my top ten. The premise is nearly impossible to describe, but suffice it to say that you've never seen one quite like this before. Starring the always intense Adrian Paul as a hilariously stiff Polish vampire, and Bai Ling as... well, the same sort of outrageous, overdressed 'vamp' she always plays, this dark and weird thriller is worth a look."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,A really god awful movie! Save your money. The scenes were dark and hard to follow. The plot was terrible. I only gave it one star because Adrian Paul was in it. At least he gave the viewer something to look at. His talent was totally wasted on this bomb.
1,Sucky movie,This movie sucked and if anymore of you goths post something good about this movie witch you dum snot noise punks will do ill trune you into hard working tax paying suit where in rebulicans...and make you watch the part in blade three where you killed over and over and over till you die ^.^ witch you probobly want to but when your about to die you wont wanna die dum asses oh and this is 2005 goths are gay now there in the hipy rank you fail like them misrably failing and wasteing away thinging if a whine enough to the goverment thell lesson to me PULLLEAZEEE the goverment could care less about your asses.
1,THEY ARE NOT VAMPIRES. THEY ARE BLOOD SUCKERS.,"This is not a vampire film, because the vampires in this film they dont die by sun light. That is not playing by the rules. Every single vampires film I ever saw, the vampires ALWAYS dies by sun light.Anyway this is a very poor vampire film. I hate the plot story, it's just crap.If you want to see good vampires movies try FRIGHT NIGHT - LOST BOYS - BLADE - FROM DUSK TILL DAWN - INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. They are the best so cheak them out."
3,Not bad for a B movie.,"This movie puts itself off as a buddy cop movie filmed in a film noir setting. As bad as this sounds it actually comes out fairly well. The movie only has one decent actor in Adrian Paul, who gives a decent but inconsistant performace as a Polish vampire with a tainted past trying to track down one of his rogue bretheren(point in case, he has accent throughout the movie with the very noticable execption of about two sceanes where it disappeares). The other main character is a cop who lost his partner to a vampire on a killing spree, is an overwritten and fairly annoying role. This is where the movie makes its main mistake. Instead of making this character a Danny Golver clone from lethal weapon, they should have cut out half of his lines and focused more on making a more visual movie in a more film noir setting. The movie looks good and has its high points, it just doesn't know when to shut up. Constiring that this was a movie a saw completely by accedent, it wasn't too bad."
2,"""But what are her chances?!""","This movie is great to watch if you're having a bad movie night with snarky friends. As a serious movie, it's a joke. The acting is atrocious, the effects are beyond cheap, and the plot *rolls eyes*. But like I said, it's good for a laugh especially on a bad movie night."
5,Good Movie,It looks stupid in the begining but gets better as it goes on. It is good but I would not stand in a huge line in the rianthe night before just to get tickets to see it.
3,I am the biggest Adrian Paul fan alive.,"This movie was a disappointment to me. I received this movie for a Mother's Day gift. I'm only giving it a 3 star because I love Adrian Paul.There were a lot of silly ""one liners"" from Bokeem Woodine. I have never seen a movie with Woodine before and I hope I never do again. The love interest between him and Bai Ling just doesn't feel right, too fake, no true emotion.I wasn't used to hearing Adrian Paul with an obviously fake accent. I'm sorry, it just didn't fit him, I am so used to his beautiful English accent.It's worth watching as a movie rental; if you have nothing else to watch."
3,"Dark, gothic, and yes, very cool...","Set in the near future, Bokeem Woodbine plays an NSA cop who makes an incredible discovery: vampires exist. Not only exist, but have made themselves known to humans for over a year. Now he must follow a string of murders with the help of his new partner, Aaron (Adrian Paul), who just so happens to be one of this ""new breed"" of humanity. Dark and filled with just the right amount of action, ""The Breed"" is a good vampire drama that also has a message about prejudice hidden within it. Woodbine (""Hard Cash"") is fine as our main character, but Paul (""Highlander: Endgame"") is the star. Not only can Paul act, he can fight. He has all the right moves to be the next big action star. All he needs is a break from his direct-to-video run. Overall, this is makes a great renter, but it's not as cool as, say, ""Underworld."""
4,Good Vampire movie,Very interesting take on the vampire/human relationship. I enjoyed the movie. Worth a look.

3,the text are distracting.,"there are many new steps shown here but are not broken down by men's part or lady's part. the text shown every few moves are distracting. voice over is used here that is why it is not an effective learning tool. the dancers just show the moves or just demonstrates them but are not broken down, i just don't know why."
1,Have been confused by title and reviews,"I have been looking for a dream book. One that can tell me about dreams and perhaps explain it to me. I was not happy with this book, this one is more of a poem book with some memoir content in it. Boring and cheap. For someone like myself who crave to know about dreams, I strongly suggest: The Fourth Sapphire Tablet of Malkhytzedek Tuthamenhaten available on amazon.com"
5,"Ahhhh!! Freaky, sad ...yet SO good!","OMG! You have to have this book if you like this series. It's great. But I warn you...it's HIGHLY freaky and so sad....sniffle...While voyaging to the planet Necropilis Tash and Zak run into some big problems...and meet some new friends. This stroy was well written , and hautingly sad , as I went to be crying soon after....be warned chara death....but nothing seroius. So anywayz you SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD buy it."
4,Star Wars City of the Dead,"Zac and Tash are on their home planet, but they had to leav quickley because the planet was going to be blown up by the death star, a weapen created by the empire. Zac Tash and their uncle Hoole were put on a transporter to get to the nearest planet. The planet was called City of the Dead. They went to the planet to buy a star ship, but while on the planet Zac made some friends and to get into the club. He had to go into the middle of the sacreat grave yard and stab a knife into the ground in front of the mosleam but when he does a hand shoots out of the ground and grabs his foot."
4,NOT BAD AT ALL!,"While I read this book, I was excited, terrified, and disapointed. This book was good. The best part is the gloomy atmosphere Whitman created for Necropolis and the spooky traditions. I've always liked Boba Fett. He, too, is in the book."
5,"Loved this good, clean romance","I was very fortunate to get this book free, but would gladly have paid the current price on it. It's a well written romance, with some adventure mixed in....and was plenty entertaining without loads of sex mixed in.Congrats to another excellent author!"
4,"Love the genre, and liked this book.","This was a good read, with interesting characters, and good plot development. There was a lot of slang usage that I didn't really understand. No other complaints though. Good editing throughout."
1,Don't take it back,This was my choice for a Kindle Premiere free book. I had not finished reading it when my month was up. It is unfair to take it back when it was called a free book. The offer should have been more clear so I knew I was going to lose it if I hadn't finished it in time.
3,Heirs to Some Biggies,"The instrumentation and internal band dynamic is obviously different, but this band came out of the blues as The Rolling Stones did. The guitarists are cleaner and less imaginative than in the Stones' early work, bandstand and studio equipment have improved and savvy players know the world's tired of covers as straight out of Chicago blues as those of young Mick and the boys, but the resultant feeling's quite similar. It leads to respect for Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and T-Bone Walker and some feeling that The Miller Brothers are their heirs"
5,absolutely fabulous,Well.. this CD has it. I'm seldom that touched by music than by this one. This CD opened me the way to understand balkan music by beeing not THAT folkish (as the reviewer said: some US influence).I admire that these musicians seem to have fun while playing and not taking the music too serious. Just enjoyable!
1,did i seriously watch this whole thing?,"just got finished watching this movie on HBO and am still not sure what i just witnessed. this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. the way the movie jumped around was if the director was trying to re-invent the pulp fiction plot twist, but only ends up confusing viewers. 1hour & 50minutes wasted, better spent on something else. anything but this horrible movie."
1,When the movie ended the fun began,"Seriously, the best part of this movie is when the credits roll. That's when Erasure's ""STOP!"" kicks in, a raucous song that will have you up and on your toes.I tuned in and out of this movie when it was on HBO, it never really held my attention. Sure there were some cute actors and actresses who were stripping down now and then but the whole movie was just bizarre. I kept watching though because I was bored. Finally this piece of junk ended and my favorite band started singing.Instead of buying this, just go buy any one of Erasure's great albums instead. More bang for your buck."
3,True to the novel,"I saw ""The Rules of Attraction"" shortly after reading the novel, and found it to be a pretty faithful and entertaining adaption. The movie stays true to the tone of the book, even if it did change the time period from the early 80's to present day. All the visual and stylistic tricks the filmmakers used worked to convey the confusion, drug use, and craziness that the troubled students of Camden college are experiencing. Since the film didn't shy away from many of the dark themes of the book, my only real complaint was how much the film minimized the homosexual relationship between Sean and Paul in the film (which was much more explicit and extensive in the book). It seems that in this day and age, drug use, suicide, and violence are all acceptable film content, but for a mainstream film, male on male sex is still too much of a taboo."
2,"When kids from the ""WB"" go bad.","Wow. What a waste of time. Since there wasn't much of a plot, I'll assume the point of the movie was to glamorize sex, drugs, and suicide. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy all those things when they're done well, but this was just trying too hard to be ""hard"". Jessica Beil as a coke [addict]? James Van-der-Beek as the psycho thrill-seeking drug dealer? Oh my, what will their parents think? This was a big laugh as much as anything. Being unintentionally funny, and having a good soundtrack were the only good points to this. The sad part is knowing that some 16 year old is going to watch this and think it's cool. I mean the sex and drugs are one thing, but there were two suicide scenes because people couldn't ""hook-up"" with their crushes. Even if the shock-value was the thing this was going for, it was just done wrong. If you want that type of film, rent ""Kids"". It's alot more realistic."
1,One star is too many,"This is one of the most odious, offensive, repellent movies I have ever seen. One reviewer urges you to look behind the shallow, hedonistic characters and find truth and beauty. Don't bother trying; there is only a void. I watched this movie with other young viewers in ultra-open-minded San Francisco, and the feeling throughout the theater was palpable. It was like enduring root canal surgery."
5,college wasteland film,"i didn't see this in the theater when most of my friend did. Most of them didn't care for it too much. When i saw it on DVD I loved it. It's shocking(but so are a lot of movies), funny, and, shows how attraction to others can force us to do many things. This movie has great replay value. Be warned this movie has a scene of a disturbing rape."
1,Worst Movie of All Time,There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie. It was a waste of time.
1,Truly horrible,"This is one of the nastiest things I've sat through for a long time. I kept waiting for some hint of wit or wisdom to emerge but it simply cloaks its vacuousness with some pretentious flashback trickery. Every character in it is repellent and despaired, sex-obsessed and self-absorbed; the violence and abuse is graphic and it has nothing to say about human nature beyond what we know happens to people who have lost touch with all decent values. I'm told that it is satirical but it's too witless to be trenchant or mordant in its observations and as for comedy - I'm afraid I could not laugh at its glorification of decadence. People who live like this live neither long nor happily but this film attempts more to legitimise and normalise their casual misery than to satirise it. Real ""vomit of despair"" - avoid it."
5,Perfect Visual Storytelling,"Yes there are tons of random hookups, rampant drug abuse, and homosexuality, but I don't think anyone could argue Ellis is ""promoting"" or ""glamorizing"" them (any more than ""Boogie Nights"" promotes being a porn actor.) I never read the book, but imagine it must be more of the same(?) I see traces of the biting social criticism of R.W. Fassbinder all over this work."
3,I sat through all of it ... so it must be ok,"RULES OF ATTRACTION is not the worst look at wasted teenagers that I have seen. In fact, it is quite watchable but it does try a little too hard at times to be funny. It was refreshing to see the Dawson's Creek guy in a different role. I found some of the scenes very sad in the movie, and that was the idea (girl's suicide). This scene was particularly well filmed and the accompanying music added definite atmosphere.Adding Faye Dunaway and Eric Stulz in short cameos made very little sense to me. I assume the purpose of that was to attract audiences, but the remaining cast did an okay job on their own.Worth watching for a snapshot of how stupid teenagers can be."
5,"Holy Terrible Trailer, Batman","After being force-fed the trailer for this movie- i had little to no interest in paying ...to see it. i simply couldn't shake the images of teen idols giving movie-of-the-week performances in a hodge-podge of Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues and American Pie. That darned Puddle of Mud song ""She Hates Me"" playing in the background while Jessica Biel jumps around like an idiot seemed to sum up what i thought the movie was going to be.it was none of these things.The film was arty, well-acted, and utterly disturbing. If you are into these things (movies like Fight Club, Trainspotting, etc.)- this film really is refreshing. The subject matter verges on the trite: college students gone wild, but the visuals and surprising talents of the cast save the film from depths of the late night commercial.Get over your first impression of the movie, get ready to laugh, get ready to be grossed out, and get ready to disturbed. Then, be ready to be strangely fulfilled."
4,Totally Screwed Up!,"After watching the first 10 minutes of Rules Of Attraction, the new movie based on the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, the man behind the twisted American Psycho,I felt like walking out. However, once it got out of the atrocious opening, I found myself quite involved in this very strange, messed up, teen film about love,sex,death, drugs, and of course, rock and roll.James Van Der Beek, Jesssica Biehl, and Shannyn Sossoman are excellent playing against type. Ian Somerhalder as Paul is the best character in the movie, and has a shot at becoming one of Hollywoods best young actors. Their really is no plot so its pointless for me to try to explain it, so all I can say is that if you like totally [messed] up movies, then this is the one for you."
2,About as satisfying as limp asparagus,"I was sadly disappointed in this latest attempt to depict the ""meaning of the meaningless of it all."" This film was chock a block full of lukewarm acting, semi-weak writing with fancy camera tricks to make up for Van Der Beek's leering (his attempt at angst?)and the lackluster character development. Jessica Biel was almost convincing as the sad little promiscuous girl looking for love and affection through sex, but who cares, since that character is totally overdone? Shannyn Sossamon, as gorgeous as she is, cannot save this trite exercise in banality. There is an uncomfortable scene in which she is vomited on while losing her virginity, but it seemed gratuitous. The best scene is when one of the kids (can't recall the name) makes an excellent scene in a restaurant."
3,You're better off to just read the book,I read the book version of this movie before I saw it and I have to say that the book was a lot better! The movie left things out and just didn't grab my attention the way the book did. I'd skip the movie altogether and read the book instead.
4,""" I always knew it would be like this""","There is always something you take from a movie , bad or good. I certainly don't know what to think of this one and I have watched it twice. You can either be completely turned on by it or turned off. College brats , that are oVer Sexed, Over exposed, and Over dosed. I think it tries to hard to be like PULP FICTION and that is where it fails, it had complete potiental adapated by the novel. WHat stuck with me was the campus stud, who went to a european vacation and went all out on drugs , and sex, when he gets back on one pivotal scene the girl who lusts after him knocks on his dorm door, much to his surprise does not remember her, but look closely on the door when he closes it on one of those erasermarks bulletins, it says, ""BE CAREFUL, CAME BACK POSITIVE."" Deep, Real and Scary that is something any human being can overlook and be affected. EITHER WAY RENT BEFORE U BUY."
2,"Weird, conceited 2 hours of time","I picked up this movie because it had Ian Somerhalder in it. Mistake. This movie is weird, brash, conceited, and thinks it is far better then it has any hope of being. I didn't know it was based off a book until I got on here, but I sincerely hope the book is better because the movie is terrible. And the ending was retarded. Pass this one up, even if you like Ian."
1,Complete Torture,"Wow. This was a terrible terrible movie. I dont even know where to begin. I guess I'll start off by saying that I gave this movie one star because it had great camera work. Other than that it really didnt have much going for it. First of all, there was no plot. none. I just kept watching it wondering where the hell the movie was going. Most of the characters were flat and undeveloped. It was extremely lengthy for a movie that went no where. I think the best part of the movie was when the credits started rolling. The only movie worse than this was Bjork's ""dancer in the dark"" and that is pretty bad my friends."
1,Disgusting and empty-headed!,"The rules of attraction is the most boring film I have ever seen. I almost walked out of the theatre when i saw this film. God, it is terrible, crummy acting from the whole cast, what the heck is Faye Dunaway doing in this movie? Did she run out of money or something? James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel are the worst actors in the world, yuck! Everyone is pucking on eachother, sick picture of people who have STD's, foul sex scenes, and even a disturbing scene of a girl committing suicide in her bathtub by slicing her wrists. What was i thinking seeing this junk, i must have been lacking brain cells that day. Don't waste you time and money with this bulls#&@!."
3,Typical Film with no suprises,"This is a typical film...sexy young stars who are all sexed up ,getting drunk and disrespecting authority.It you like these types of movies give this a go ..you'll find nothing you haven't seen before in 'Rules of Attraction' but it's worth a go if you like neatly packaged movies with predictable plots."
3,stupid kid,"In comparison to Bret Easton Ellis' novel, this movie is quite the dissapointment. Unfortunetly, I viewed it before reading the book. Although, I have to admit, the movie is still quite entertaining , I wouldn't recommend it until reading it first. Most of the acting was good, while some seemed a bit forced. James Van Der Beek, in my opinion, did a wonderful job and in my eyes, shed his ""goody goody"" appearence. Without the music, and certain settings, this movie wouldn't be half as good."
1,YiKeS!,"This movie is trying very hard to be a Pulp Fiction for a younger crowd, and you can tell. It mostly fails and the resulting film is an almost unwatchable nightmare."
1,Easily the worst movie I have ever seen!,"You know most times I dont listen when people tell me a movie was horrible b/c I know I have different tastes, but I shoulda listened this time. The actors in the film who usely produce such great films and tv shows, severely dropped the ball here. The storyline was poorly developed and so were the characters which made the end of the movie to me be like ""So what, who cares."" Honestly if you wanna see a well acted and rebelious story, dont watch this film, its not even worth quenching your curiosity, PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS! Well lets change that if you are on an acid trip or something the movie might be interesting."
1,girl you nasty,"this movie is empty. it made me feel gross. i wonder who this movie was marketed to... people who think they like good movies but actually don't? someone had fun in the editing room making things backwards and freeze-frame which doesn't work if there's no purpose. i hate movies where the narration is too dumb to take and this is one of them. if you like weird, random movies i recommend seeing some of the better ones (requiem for a dream, being john malkovich, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind or punch drunk love). this film does earn one star because jessica biel is cool and we're getting married this summer."
4,Definitely not for everyone,"This is the kind of movie, I've noticed, that people either really like or can't stand at all. Cult-like, sort of.The film is true, if not in exact content, then at least to the spirit of the book, so if you disliked this movie you would almost definitely not like the book. Bret Easton Ellis' purpose in writing seems to be a barely-contained howl at the vacuousness of modern life, so if you don't especially like that kind of thing you would probably not find the film very entertaining. The film also has no real plot or storyline, which also seems to put off many, but the point of the film is to depict a lifestyle, a set of people and their conflicts with one another. It is about life, and life has no neat endings and beginnings.You either like this film or you don't. I did, but many people I know hated it. I still strongly recommend it, but I warn you: In the words of Hermann Hesse, it is ""not for everyone."""
1,Let's not Rock & Roll,"If this movie didn't attempt to be something more than a flick for teen-age boys, I might not have taken several moments to sit back and think about it. However, since the makers of Rules attempted at a contrived philosophy throughout the movie, I feel the need to let anyone curious about this moive know the truth. This movie is painfuly stupid. The characters are weak and petty, the acting is one dimensional, and the script was a patchwork of several good movies, which gave Rules of Attraction a perverse Frankenstein make-up.If you're into mindless sex and nudity which is attempted to be passed as ""DEEP"", then rent this. The only emotion this movie will stir in anyone who isn't a teen boy is depression over the fact that you actually sat down and watched this. And god forbid if you actually paid for it!"
4,A Genuine Achievement,"I don't usually review movies on Amazon but felt I had to take a moment to praise Rules of Attraction for really capturing the lives of children of privilege. Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth. A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people. By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.The film collapses under its own weight at the end. Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century. Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush."
4,Interesting and innovative,"Be prepared to be brutally astounded by this film, The rules of Attraction. Starring some very WB teen like players James Van Der Beek, and Jessica Beil i figured I was entering into another idealistic teen movie (due to the trailer previews), but I found a film that was very dark and amazingly thought out. Based on the novel, Rules enters you into the world of some very confused college students. Though their everyday sex lives, emotions and social positions are completely exaggerated , there are many levels of the story that really arent that far from true University life. College students will and are constantly in a uncomfortable position of ""soul searching"", and I felt, through thiis interesting satirical medium, the film shows emotions of youth rarely shown . Not recommened for the conservative type, come with an open mind!"
1,"Loved the Book, Hated the movie","Read and loved the book, decided to give the movie a shot despite the pop teen cast. Horrible. The movie is a hatchet job. The director tried to modernize a book that was written for a time when fast sex, drugs and unmerited self-righteousness what the norm (the early 80's, pre-aids scare). The movie is extremely loosely based on the book, and lost much of its essence. Suggestion: read the book, forget the movie."
3,"Great move, blu-ray has digital artificating.","This is a great movie.But the blu-ray disc has digital artifacts (which look like square boxes) at the beginning when Lauren is talking about how Laura ended up sleeping with the entire football team drunk one night.I've learned over the past few years that Lionsgate releases are notorious for not meeting quality specifications. Stay away from Lionsgate releases if possible as they are faulty and of poor quality.I bought one copy of this blu-ray on Amazon, returned it when I saw the anomaly and exchanged it for another copy (thinking it was just a bad disc), but the artifacts showed up again on my second disc. This is something their authoring QC department must have missed."
3,unique and too similar at the same time...,"The movie reminded me of Pulp Fiction in some ways.The way the scenes are somewhat out of order,yet this was a very good movie.It shows college life and the teens in it.It shows an intresting love triangle all connected to Shawn (James Van Der Beek).This movie has some ironic twists but is overall intresting."
3,Dawson can actually act,"The Rules of Attraction was actually a good film. Dawson was actually good as a psychotic drug dealer.The whole film was based on the love triangle between Sean Bateman ( Van der BEEK) a flamboyant bisexual ( Ian Sommerhalder) and a virgin girl ( Shannon Sossoman). The film itself gave very little insight of College life, but overall the quality was good fun. My favorite scenes were when Paul and his gay friend Dick were dancing to George Michael's ''Faith'', which was the film's highlight. Jessica Biel wasn't too believeable playing a slutty character in the film. It was just another attempt for Biel to abandon her 7TH HEAVEN tv image.The film stayed true to the book mostly, except for the fact Avary didn't show much of the homosexual relationship between Sean and PAUL. The split screen process in the film was a bit tiresome, but overall I liked it!"
5,Misunderstood,"From the a lot of the other reviews I have read on this dvd I would say that a lot of people definately misunderstood the film. It might have to do with their age...in fact it probably has to do completely with their age. For those of us who are not over the age of 25 it is probably a film you can enjoy, that is only if you are not sensitive to sex, drugs, and suicide. Especially those of us who enjoy the ""weirder"" films.For those of you that did not take an intro to film class the tricks the film has to offer should be blatant. And I should hope you can enjoy the benefits of the filmakers labor.I give it two thumbs up!Those of you who do buy this dvd must check out the extras(they are fabulous)!!"
3,What Was I Thinking?,"I have to admit, I just wanted to see ""The Rules of Attraction"" just to see James Van Der Beek kiss Ian Somerhalder.However, I was quite surprised to see the film because I thought I was going to see another ""American Pie"" flick. Nope. This is a depiction of how kids are nowadays. The world of drugs, liquor, sex, etc. The Tarantinouesque touch on the editing of this film does give ""Rules Of Attraction"" some panache, but this film gives us an insight of how a good number of kids of our generation now think.There is a lot of irreverence in this film, and however irreverent they are, it is quite realistic.If you're a teenager who just wants to laugh your heart out and expect another ""American Pie"" or ""Road Rules"" kind of film, then skip this one and save yourself some money."
3,Three and 1/2 really. The Darkly comic and Self-obsessed,"A fascinating and energetic look at that same vacuous crowd that Ellis writes about in his other novels. In truth, there really is nothing new here: bored rich kids who use each other, screw anybody who offers, use drugs and party. But, it is like watching a wild car crash - you can't help but be enthralled. There is some fun camera work (some that becomes annoying as well), prety good performances and a nifty soundtrack. If you're in the mood for watching some attractive self-destructive folks party and play - this might hit you right. If you are not in that mood - watch out! There is no redemption here, just the dark comedy of the self-induced drama and tradgedy that only characters of this age can believe is reality. Features a very funny cameo scene with Swoosie Kurtz and Faye Dunaway doing their best AB Fab inpersonations."
4,"Good, Dirty Fun","In very likeness to ""Cruel Intentions"", ""Rules of Attraction"" is not for everyone, but to those who do enjoy a taste of the seedy side of life, it become a cult-like guilty pleasure. It remains captivating by focusing less on plot (your run-of-the-mill love triangle) and more on content (sex, drugs, suicide, and art direction nearly as cool as Tarintino). It's a fun way to kill a few hours and to waste your I.Q. with surprisingly convincing stars like Jessica Biel and James Van Der Beek."
3,forced packaging,"i first went into this movie looking to hate it. the way it was sold to the audience, the reviews (one actually said the movie had no point, it just 'ended'), and the cast all prepped me to hate it.but since im a roger avery fan, i took a chance.i wasnt let down by the directing or the cinematography. the acting, surprisingly, was quite well. van der beek made some of his lines sound a bit corny or forced as did sossaman. van der beeks glare looked a little out of place or poorly acted. Ian Somerhalder, on the other hand, was perfect.my only prob with the movie was the model/actours and the advertising. better than killing zoe, not as good as way of the gun."
2,"Unpleasent, and Pointless. Directing intersting though.","This is a movie in the tradition of American Beauty, Doomsday Generation and those other flicks that trys so hard to become art that they end up losing the main point. Its not fun to watch. Imagine watching pathetic students that have no direction, lead their lives in to utter disaster because their fantasy idea of love ones don't come true. What is the point of making such a depressing and uninspiring movie? On the plus side the directing was interesting to watch, with the backwards theme like Memento, and it had some interesting visuals/angles as well. This is why I gave the movie two stars instead of one. If you like movies like American Beauty, or Doomsday Generation this might appeal to you, but stay far away if you hated those movies like I do."
5,Great Hair Color,"I have tried many different hair colors, and I find this to be the best. I would estimate that I have about 15% gray hair and this covers it beautifully. I get great color with little brassy-ness. It lasts a good 4-6 weeks. When a few gray hairs show again, I treat the roots with my natural color and a 20 developer for 35 minutes, comb through the rest of my hair and wait 10 minutes, then wash out."
4,Fun book but somewhat challenging for my fifth graders,This book is historical fiction and I purchased it for my 5th graders to read in conjuction with learning about post-revolution France. It has some French phrases in the dialogue which has been fun since my kids are also learning French. The vocabulary was somewhat challenging for my kids.
4,A beautifully written story,"This book is one I return to every year or two, and I'm always enchanted by Eleanor Cameron's artistic, finely-tuned prose. The story is well thought out and told with sensitivity and depth. It is definitely one of the most treasured books in my collection."
5,Excellent Product!,This is a delicious rice dish. Add some cooked chicken chunks and a package of mixed frozen vegetables and you have a complete meal! My family loves it.
4,"good taste, quick and easy",Have found this product quite tasty.. little more salt than I should have but not too much... goes well with chicken and fish dishes particulary well.
5,A beautiful book,"I read My Name is Aram as a high school student, and as a number of the stories stayed with me throughout my life, I decided to reread this as an adult. It did not disappoint. This is beautiful, understated, storytelling. Charming and unpretentious. A book all children should read and perhaps the one Saroyan book that still resonates."
3,Could've been so much more...,"I'm not a fan of Nelly Furtado, but my dad is and he has all her albums. I did like ""FOrca"" and when my dad bought this album, I was dissapointed.Reason why FOLKLORE was amazing was because it was an exploration of so many types of music. It takes itself seriously and has actual feel and edge to it.This is actually a bit too Gwen Stefani-ish for my musical tastes. As a matter of fact, I only listen tom rock music, but when I heard FOLKLORE, I was constantly secretly listening to it (because it was my dad's) and I memorized all lyrics. It's not like that for this.OVERALL: Dissapointing."
2,no...,"i definately don't like her...THIS STYLE IS NOT 4 HER, Timbaland has made the wrong choice...she should sing folk songs, not dance!!"
3,i forgive you nelly....,"i just got this album and for some reason i doubled checked it if i was listening to the right one. the cd was labeled nelly not beonce. there must be a mistake. is this the same girl who did 'folklore' and 'whoa nelly'? i know she has a new producer but this is a total departure. you will not expect a person who loved 'folklore' to like this one. 'folklore' was profound and is the album that i would take to the grave. a work of art. 'loose' is nowhere near it. i want my artist back. but because she made 'folklore', i'll give her 3 stars and the benefit of the doubt that she'll come back to her roots."
2,what does it mean?,"Most of the tracks are catchy, but the songs (especially All Good Things) are nonsense. Either it's going over my head or they mean nothing at all to me."
5,Great Comeback,"This is absolutely a GREAT comeback for Nelly Furtado. Sure, it wasn't what I was expecting either, but it's definitely NOT a ""sell out."" That's just crazy. Just because you evolve and mature into a different style, that doesn't mean you're a sell out. People hating are just jealous because this album is HOT!!! This is going to be getting played ALL summer long. It's fresh, funky, fun and it's perfect for Nelly Furtado. If she was still singing stuff like ""I'm Like A Bird,"" I'd be really worried. Nelly voice fits Timbaland's production perfectly. I'm not disappointed by ""Loose"" at all. I love every single song. This biggest surprise is how GREAT the album is. Pop music was good in the 80's and early 90's and this album is reminiscent of those glory days, but with a modern flair courtesy of Timbaland."
1,"So, so bad!!","Was forced to give this one at least one star, (Amazon won't let you give less). Awful album. Embarrassingly bad lyrics. Don't torture yourself."
3,Didn' t think it was that great,"I got this CD when it first came out and I didn't think that it was that great. There were only a few songs on there that I would really remember. The others were not memorable at all. Now, her CD is sitting in the very back of my CD collection. There are better CD's out there."
5,She upgrades every cd....,"I've been a Nelly Furtado fan since her spot on the Brokedown Palace soundtrack. First cd: So different, I learned to absolutly love it, never ever got sick of it, you learn new things every time you play it over and over. Second cd: Even more unique, loved it even more, didn't think a sophomore album would surpase my expectations! This cd: CAN'T BELIEVE - HUHHH I was nervous at first because in the last 2 cd's she was so different (her style, her music her lyrics) I thought she changed her style and turned ""club-typical"". BUT OH MY GOODNESS no, she is all her own. If her music was her college, she'd be on the dean's list. She just upgrades with every cd. This cd is sooooo hot. Every song is a hit, I can't find a favorite! Incredible! I am an absolute fan for life. In every cd she writes, every song can be categorized in different genres. Never judge a Nelly Furtado cd by her single! This cd is a MUST buy."
4,NOT A SELLOUT,nelly furtado was a great artist in 2000 and still is.the fact is that her second album didnt do well and to get back in the lime light she had to try different things to do so.MUSIC HAS CHANGED AND TEENS ARE LOOKING FOR UPBEAT SONGS LIK PROMISCUOUSso leave her alone or just dont listen to her music if u have such a problem with it
1,Don't waste your money,"I was really looking forward to this cd after hearing ""promiscuous girl"" and ""te busque"" but was thoroughly disappointed. All of the other songs on the album swim in a sea of mediocrity. Don't waste your money."
1,Zero Stars,She sold out and took the yo girl route. Too bad. Just like Jenny from the block. It's garbage....
5,wow,"What an amazing piece of work, I have only listened once but I already know that I will be listening over and over again in the years to come. I must admit that was not the greatest fan of Nelly's music before but now I'm a convert! What can I say, the songwriting, production and Nelly's performance are outstanding and fresh. She shares such a personal journey on this album, she is not so much 'Loose' as robust, bold and questioning... impressive in short! I love it when artists feel free to explore new musical territory, especially when they come with this level of talent, it can only make us all the better for it!"
1,Could of been better but what's done is done!,"I retracted my negative review due to the fact that I didn't give the cd more time to sink in. I still think Nelly could of sounded better if she had less music around her. I continue to love your voice, Nelly!"
2,Simply Okay,"I bought this album because I loved the first single ""Promiscuous"" so much. The rest of the album is unfortunately quite blah. There don't seem to be any other standout tracks other than ""Promiscuous"". I like that she went in a different direction from her first two albums, but it just doesn't click and most of the tracks are mediocre at best. I'd recommend just downloading one or two songs on I-Tunes and avoid wasting money on the entire album."
3,"Just saw Nellie Furtado at the halftime of 94th Grey Cup in Winnipeg, Canada. Folklure, Loose ain't...","Yes, Virginia Nellie can sing. Yes she's cuteas all get out and no she isn't a CFL fan? Istill can't figure out THE LEAGUE of Pro Foo-tball getting all these Canadian stars thatare NOT into the CFL? Amanda Marshall in TO.,a couple years ago at halftime and last yearsnon-Canadian disaster, The Brown-eyed peas(only good song to date 'Get It Started'). No,Nellie probably won't do any more Grey Cupsas that is just not in the cards, but the GCwill never have better half time entertainmentthan Bryan Adams, Shania Twain or the TragicallyHip, as in recent years. But expect Nellie to begiggling around, A La Chritina Aguielera for yrs.to come. At least she's not Avril Lavigne! Whoops,that's who'll probably be the halftime entertain-ment next ano!"
1,cookie cutter...top 40 caca,"it is no surprise they're selling copies for one penny. i have heard her singles off of this album on the radio and basically she has no sound of her own. you hear her song and it's like, ""is this the black eyed peas? or is it britney? or maybe j-lo?"" this is the type of ca ca that the suits at the major record labels are pushing on our gullible teeny bopper, the most gullible, undiscerning music listener, and pass this crap off as good music! this is what i cal ""EAR DIARREAH"". TRUST ME if you're interested in hearing real music that involves innovation and true artistry, THIS ISN""T IT. this is record company, money making crap that is all about image and has nothing to do with music as an art form.it's all about peddling crappy music to teeny boppers who don't know better or individuals with poor musical taste that buy into all the garbage music played on top 40 radio..amen..."
1,Very disappointing!!!,"I fell in love with her two first albums, and when I saw she was coming out with her new album LOOSE... I just could not wait to purchase it. Now that I have it... I wish I would have never got it. Nelly darling you need to go back to your roots. I give this album a two thumbs down!"
3,Solid music CD,I thought that this CD would be just another Britney Spears wanna-be CD were the singer just tries to act all innocent and cute. But I was wrong. This CD actually is a solid CD with great beats and songs stemming from various backgrounds. Definately a good buy.
5,Hotness,"This album is hot. Period. There's a good amount of danceable/club-ish sounding tracks on there to make it a fun CD to throw in your car. Furtado also has a few slower songs on here, but they are few and far between.Definately pick this up, this is THE summer 2006 album."
1,Horrible horrible horrible,"I love nelly furtado, honestly i do, but somewhere along her journey to making this album something very drastic happened. she missed her way, the album is as unforthcoming as possible. it sucks big time!!!, i bought it and now im giving it away. no words can truly describe how bad this album is. please save ur money and buy something more useful..."
2,dissapointing,The cd cover of mine came broke. I'm a tad upset about it but it's not bad enough to ask for a refund.good cd though
2,Not what I expected,"I've been a big fan of Nelly Furtado since her first album. It took me a bit to like her latest single, ""Promiscuous"". But the more and more I listen to it, I started to like Nelly's new direction and couldn't wait for the new album. I bought it the first day it was made available.After listening her album, I found out that ""Promiscuous"" is not representative of the rest of the album. Also equally disappointing is that her Portuguese roots are gone - she instead opted to sing in Spanish (is this the record company's doing?)None of the songs have the magic of ""I'm like a bird."" and her focus has shifted from Pop music of her earlier two albums to Hip-Hop.If you are a big fan of Hip-hop music, I would say buy this album - you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you were a big fan of Nelly Furtado's earlier work, save your money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Boy, am I glad I rented this from my library before wasting money buying it. You are probably interested in this cd because of track 3 - WHICH IS THE ONLY HOT SONG on the album. The rest are slow, boring, or both - I just can't believe Nelly put together such a weak album, and I am very dissapointed. In fact, if this had been my first introduction to Nelly as an artist, I wouldn't dream of listening to her earlier albums and would have missed the F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S Whoa Nelly (which I own and play to death). Even J-Lo's albums have more good songs than Loose! Harsh, I know, but heed my words before buying this on impulse - you will regret it. Download track 3 and wait until Nelly hopefully finds the beat again on her next album, whenever that will be."
1,Nelly Sells Out,"What once was a promising young singer downplaying her beauty while focusing on a unique music style has now turned into the latest artist to sell out for bigger sales. Whether it was Nelly's choice or her record label disappointed with sales of her second CD ""Folklore"", ""Loose"" is an obvious attempt to restart her career by signing on with producers and stars that can get her music on the radio. The songs on ""Loose"" could just as easily be sung by J-Lo, Janet Jackson or any other generic voice lost in the beat. And Nelly makes sure her beauty is in obvious view for all to see. Lots of fans raving about this CD admit they never bought her prior CDs. For those of us that did, ""Loose"" is a major disappointment and sell-out."
1,Dis(Loose)appointment,"Very disappointing CD, after two excellent and unique previous two albums. Let's hope that after the ""Loose"" fiasco Nelly will dump her current shallow co-producers and return to her original style and won't compromise again her artistic creativity to produce another boring mass market set."
1,Disappointment of the Year,"I recently saw a cell phone commercial and thought that the music playing was the Black Eyed Peas. To my horror, I looked up and saw Nelly Furtado's name on the screen.Her first two albums are absolutely amazing, so I know it isn't a matter of lack of talent. I can only blame The Recording Industry (tm) for this atrocity.If you didn't like Whoa Nelly! and Folklore, but love the Black Eyed Peas (as sadly, the majority of the brainwashed masses do) then buy this album."
1,a Corperate Broke attempt at Gwen Stefani,"sine Nelly Furtado's last album basically went Reynolds Wrap here in the states the Record Company was like we gotta get you some grooves,lets get Timberland. Timberland during the mid to late 90's hit his peak as a Beat-Maker,but never really added anything to himself beyond beats&he eventually fell out of Groove. Nelly Furtado is now forced to play catch up with Gwen Stefani in a attempt at a Accessible sound&style that while has a minute or two coolness,loses it's appeal rather sooner than later. vocally she is a lightweight. her best attempts at coming back are on places where Timberland can't be found.this is only her 3rd release&the record company already is pushing her to being a Gwen Stefani Clone. the irony is that Nelly is more comfortable in this style than what I heard on Gwen's Solo Album,but on the real neither album made much of a impression on me on a whole."
2,What a sell out!,"I loved Nelly Furtado's cd Folklore. But what I used to love about Nelly Furtado was that she prided herself in her music... not bumping and grinding with Justin Timberlake. Why does nearly every single famous female feel the need to suddenly become a sex image? She's a gorgeous girl and she doesn't need to sport a baby tee to prove it. For that reason alone, I can't see myself purchasing her cd despite her talent in music."
3,Liking It - 3.5 stars,"I got this mostly because of Timbaland's beats on ""Promiscuous"" - I liked! I liken this CD to a better version of the whole Gwen Stefani L.A.M.B. retro 80's thing. In fact, I find ""Maneater"" and ""Hollaback Girl"" to be interchangable songs (not necessarily a good thing, but ""Maneater"" is better, IMO).The beats on this CD are really hot - Timbaland and Nelly work well together. ""Afraid"", ""Promiscuous"", ""No Hay Igual"" and ""Say It Right"" stand out.For true 80's revival, check out ""veteran"" artists like Madonna's ""Confessions On A Dance Floor"" and Prince's ""3121"". As a kid from the 80's, I'd love to hear other artists from that era re-establish this ""new"" 80's trendy sound.Hopefully ""forgotten"" artists like George Michael, Cyndi Lauper and The Eurythmics (among others) can bring the listening world some proper comebacks so we can remember just how good the 80's could be."
3,Could have been better,"About half of the tracks are good, the rest sound the same. Tries to be a rapper or something. She has a great voice and should concentrate on her material more. The album doesn't have an identity Is it Rock, Rap, Club? What?"
4,I love Nelly now!,I have never been interested in Nelly Furtardo. I don't have any of her previous albums but when this album came out I was just very curious. I love this album. It is so good and I enjoy listening to it all the time.
5,"Nelly, You Rocked this Album",I love this Cd For people who Hate It F**K off cuz Nelly is the Shiznit
3,Old Nelly,"I was disappointed with most of this CD. I love Nelly Furtado's voice, but she tried to sound like someone else on most of this CD."
1,Poorly produced crudites,"Crudites - you know, those slivers of vegetable that you dunk into various dips? They're great finger food, they're appetisers to keep you occupied until the meal arrives.This album is full of crudites - stuff that is in some way entertaining to listen to, but it all left me wondering when the *real* music was going to arrive. I can understand how people like this stuff - crudites can be very tasty (sweet, sweet carrots, beautifully crunchy cauliflower), but not very filling.""Promiscuous"" really sets the tone for the album for me - an attempt to appeal to popular taste without any thought for moral or artistic integrity."
4,"Nelly Furtado reinvents herself, and excels at it (41/2 stars)","When I heard the song ""Promiscuous"" on the radio, I couldn't believe it was Nelly Furtado. As someone who owns and loves ""Whoa, Nelly"", I couln't imagine she will go in the direction she is right now. I am not surprised though, since I heard the excellent remix to ""Get your freak on"". I have to say I love this album. It's very upbeat; there are only three slow songs. If I didn't give it five stars, its because I really don't like ""Glow"", ""Showtime"" and ""Do it"". If you like dance music, buy this cd. ""Maneater"", ""Afraid"", ""Te busque"", ""No hay igual"", ""Wait for you"" and ""All good things"" are excellent songs. I specially love ""All good things""; the chorus is extremely beautiful."
5,Hot,"This CD is awesome. I have liked Nelly Furtado from the beginning, even through some style changes, but I was pretty blown away by the energy of the songs -- can't help but dance! I'm a fan of the style, so it works for me - if you are looking for her old styles you may not approve of the change. It is my crank-it-up CD, and others who have listened have said the same. I am very very happy with my choice!"
5,Better Than I Expected,"I have Nelly's first CD and I have to say I definately didn't get what I expected. So after her single came out, I decided to give her another shot. And it was worth it. This CD is really good, theres upbeat dancing songs, sing-along songs and slow, melodic ones. Definatley recommend if you like Shakira and Natasha Bedingfield and stuff like that. Got get it."
4,Nice job Nelly!,"Having been a Nelly Furtado fan since ""Whoa Nelly"" back in 2000, its great to see an artist who really knows how to keep it fresh.In one of the neatest reinventions in recent years, Furtado has put out a great album providing an exciting blend of hip hop, R&B;, dance pop, folk and raggae. From the haunting ""Afraid"" to the catchy-as-hell ""Promiscuous"" or the instant classic 80's themed ""Do It."" ""Te Busque"" is another single-worthy track and puts any other latin-pop male-female collaboration to shame. It is with Juanes after all.But the song that makes the CD one of the year's best so far on its very own, is ""Maneater."" Wow. This is possibly song of the year - catchy, loud and bold, it will hopefully be her second single and take her back to the top of the charts all over again!"
4,Loose,"I'm rather new to Nelly Furtado music. I've heard songs on the radio, but this is the first CD. Other than a couple songs that aren't my type, little too hip hop, it's a really nice CD. She has a fantastic voice!"
1,"Well, it ain't ""tight""","WARNING: The album version of ""Maneater"" meanders and stalls-out after less than 3 minutes (at what I would consider the song's climax), descending into over a minute and a half of nearly a cappella vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and ad-libs by Timbaland; the track concludes with several seconds of studio dialog. ""Loose"" is another frustrating example of an album that does not include the same version of the song heard on the radio or in the video.LOOSE consists of 13 songs, two of which are versions of ""Te Busque"". Most of the songs are produced by Timbaland. Booklet does not include lyrics.The album is listen-able, and while the percussion-based ""No Hay Igual"" is interesting, other than the poorly edited ""Maneater"" and the over-played ""Promiscuous"", there are no stand-out tracks."
2,What happened?,"After the near brilliance of FOLKLORE, LOOSE comes as a shocking disappointment.There is no unifying theme or style to LOOSE (which is most probably the inspiration for its title). The tracks are strung together with a tediously similar beat, and each begins with an amateurish group chat or giggle. Were it not for the addition of Te Busque, a collaboration with JUANES, this cd would be a complete waste of time."
1,"Love the music, but not the way it was recorded.","I have always been a fan of Nelly Furtado's music and have enjoyed her previous albums. I really like ""say it right"" when I first heard it sometime ago, but thought that the radio station had a problem because the song was badly distorted on the bass and was clipping. But then I started hearing the same distortion on other copies and have found out that was the way it was ""intentionally"" recorded. Sorry, but to me that just ruined the song and left me wanting to hear the song the way it was really being performed in the studio before they botched it up in the mixing console. I am glad I found out this information before I bought the CD (which I almost did, but would have taken it back). It is sad to me that this is considered a good thing to do to this song and others. I guess this will be the only CD of her's that I will not be purchasing."
2,Disappointed,"This is what happens when artists get too ambitious, ohh man i'm gonna miss the old Nelly."
1,1 star is just not low enough.,Where did Nelly go?Come back to the fanbase that loves you! You're a folk artist; not a hip-hop/r&b; sellout.
2,Try Before You Buy,"This Cd is not That good But She tried She should just stick to pop music.The only song that is good is Premiscous other than that. But the other songs have okay beats,She Should have done better but As long as she like it its cool."
1,This Is Weak,"There are millions of pretty to average looking young girls out there who think they can sing, but in reality they can't. How did Nelly Furtado get so lucky? Even though ""Loosed"" was heavily produced by Timbaland, it's still lame. A weak, warbly voice being drowned by the heavy sounds of a beat machine. You can tell that Nelly is a Gwen Stefani fan because that's who she often attempts to copy when it comes to vocals and musical style. Nelly can't sing and she can't rap either. I saw her performing on the show ""So You Think You Can Dance"" last week and she, along with Timbaland, both looked like pieces of cardboard on stage. So add 'no stage presence' to the list. Supposedly Nelly can play a few instruments, but I heard very few instruments being played. Anyway, there's nothing special about this CD. This will be forgotten like a hot dog and macaroni & cheese dinner at the end of the month. Skip it!"
3,Appealing,"Although I've heard Nelly Furtado before and have always liked her voice, this CD is the first one I actually purchased. I was curious to hear her new 'transformation' and I believe this CD appeals to several different musical styles. I love both versions of ""Te Busque,"" and ""Showtime"" shows she can also do a soulful ""slow jam"" quite well. I also enjoy revisiting the 80's ""Do It"" which is 'Madonna-esque' and brings back wonderful dance memories from that time. There are a few tracks that I can't quite get into, but I do respect her talent and vocal diversity. I'm curious to see what her next effort will be; but in the meantime, I would recommend this CD if you're ready to get ""Loose."""
5,Great CD,Nelly Furtado really sounds good on this CD. When I finally saw her on TV I couldn't believe how bad she sounded. Since I have never seen her perform live I don't know if she is a studio performer or a really good singer. Either way the CD is worth listening too. Hopefully she is not a Milli Vanilli type of singer. I haven't heard anything about her in the last couple of years but I enjoy this CD.
5,A true gem.,"""The Russians are Coming........"" is just one continuous laugh. ! It's the most humorous spoof on the Cold War I've ever seen. What a marvellous commentary on the times (60's) and American paranoia. As stated, this film could not have been made in Russia. A big thank you to Alan Arkin."
4,retro fun,"For those who long for the good ole days of Russia vs U.S. this will take them back to those glory days. For those of us who lived during those times and endured the stupidity spouted from both sides, this is a refreshing and humorous look back at those times. The 60's were filled with chaos and total craziness and this movie pokes fun at all of it. I give this movie two thumbs up for showing what the Cold War was really like; stupid and idiotic."
3,There were never subtitles of the Russian dialogue.,"I just wanted to correct the impression given by a previous reviewer that this DVD is ""missing"" subtitles translating the dialogue of the Russian characters, such as the captain, etc.I just got home from seeing a screening of this with Norman Jewison (the director) and one of its stars, Eva Marie Saint, there in person. The issue of subtitles came up; Jewison explained that he had thought subtitles for the Russians were unnecessary. They weren't done. The previous reviewer is probably just misremembering."
3,"It`s so bad, it`s good...","Imagine seeing this about a decade ago in a college dorm room with a South African, a Ukrainian, a Russian, a Japanese, and 2 Americans (all friends, of course) and you can imagine the laugh fest that this became! The characterizations were poking fun on purpose at the Cold War and other issues, but that the characterizations were so awful and a product of their times as well was even funnier! (20/20 hindsight, right?!) What a luxury it is to laugh during times of political strife (...and be reviewing videos online, for that matter) but by all means, indulge! See it with friends, though...it becomes much more interesting, particularly at 2:00 in the morning!"
5,"The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming","A very funny movie made at a time when the Cold War was very much on everyone's minds. Alan Arkin was at his best in this movie and the cast of various comedians of that time complemented each other.My 42 old son had never seen it and we watched it together this summer and he loved it too, so I would say it has stood the test of time very well. He took it back to San Francisco with him to share with his 2 collegues who were both born in the Soviet Union. They had told him they saw it back in the 70s over there and loved it too."
4,The Russians Are Coming,"This is a really great comedy with good acting by Carl Reiner and Jonathan Winters. It was boytcottedby the Russians at first, but when it got such good reviews, the producer was invited to show it atthe Kremlin. He replied that he'd love to, but had no visa. The following morning a courier arrivedat his door with both a visa and air tickets."
4,"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming","A very entertaining film made during the cold war. There are numerous humorous scenes that typifies a New Englander, from the town drunk who envisioned himself as reinacting Paul Revere's famous ride to the old Veteran who thought he should organize a militia to protect the city from what was viewed as an impending attack by Russians who only wanted to find a way to get themselves back to sea. I think it is well done. Alan Arkin does a great job portraying a Russian officer who is frustrated with his Captain."
4,"LOVE THE MOVIE, HATE THE MONO AUDIO","I first saw this movie as a kid when it was first released in 1966 (at the Village Theatre on the Ocean City,NJ boardwalk.) What a joy! I too watch it often because it is so funny. HOWEVER......I recently was given a suround sound system, and this DVD was released in MONO. I truly adored not just the performances in this movie but also the music. But, alas, even after trying all the different settings on my surround sound system, I am not ""surrounded"" by the music, it will only come out of the front speaker. I was sooooooo disappointed. I would go out and buy a blu ray player tomorrow, if this would be re-released on blu ray in stereo, or dolby 5.1. I hope this will happen one day, but I'm not holding my breath.So the movie gets 5 stars, but the MONO sound track gets 1 star."
5,Outstanding,"i don't know why more people don't rate this movie as ""the best"". It has everything a good movie should have: mystery, suspense, romance, political satire, and funny and serious at the same time. One of the best of all time."
5,A Hilarious Spoof of the Cold War,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I started this movie. The opening scene is a group of men in a submarine speaking Russian... with no subtitles... let me just say that I was very confused. But these odd bouts of randomness are what makes this movie so great! I would definitely watch this movie again, and highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates Monty-Python type comedy."
5,Da! Da! Da!,"I've loved this movie since it came out in 1966. I watch it every couple of months, and it never ceases to make me feel better...Brilliant performances by Alan Arkin, Brian Kieth, Paul Ford, Carl Reiner and Jonathan Winters! The subplot of hunky russian sailor-local girl romance is a bit of a yawn, but that's the only negative thing I can find to say about it. Special mention goes to the FINE performance of the Northern California coast in the role of Gloucester Island."
1,"the movie is great, but the two on dvd i received are NOT coded for the USA!!!","this is suppose to be a multi-national, coded dvd, but 2 for 2 were rejected by my new dvd player. i then placed both into my lap-top and a message displayed that 2/5 codes worked while 3 were inactive (USA, being 1/3 inactive codes). so, don't purchase this dvd unless you watch it on your computer online. HOWEEVER, the movie is excellent!!! it is totally clean, comical, with some drama, romance, and warmth of humanity. so i have cept one of the 'not coded for the USA' copies for my laptop, because i cannot get it anyother way apparently. NOT EVEN FROM AMAZON!"
4,An oldie but goodie!,"I was amazed to find that I could not find this anywhere in a rental kiosk, so had to purchase it to show to my forty-something daughter and her two teenaged kids. It was as good as I remembered, and to see my 15 y/o grandson laugh at some of my favorite scenes (such as Ben Blue chasing around the meadows after his horse to be able to warn the residents, or Jonathan Winters maniacally shouting, ""First thing we have to do is get organized!"") told me that not all humor has to be generationally restricted. It was a great return, and I have Carl Reiner to thank for much of the glue that held it together."
4,A good movie for fans of American Indian films,"I'm not a big Ricky Schroeder fan, but I am a Russell Means fan.In fact, I probably wouldn't have watched the movie if it weren't for him. I don't think he's getting near the credit he deserves for his contribution to the movie, but that's just me. All in all, it's a good movie, and I feel that it gives an accuarate portrayal of modern life of young American Indians on the Rez today, simply because Russell Means, being who he is, would not have been a part of it if it didn't, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mr. Means."
5,EXCELLENT-MUST HAVE,"Managing a move rental store years ago, this is what we called ""B"" movies. This is an A+ movie, hands down!! Wonderful story of pride and dreams. I was surprised to learn that Ricky Schroder, wrote, directed and produced this movie, per the back of my box. You will not be disappointed if you like family clean movies. There is a couple of fight seens that you may want to check out before letting the little ones watch with you. Other than that, I only have good, good things to say."
4,Good Effort - if a bit uneven,"This is by no means a great film, but it is certainly better than many reviewers here give it credit for. Schroeder is to be commended for his efforts. The low budget is evident throughout, but the acting is solid and the message an important one. Even if it is a bit overwrought, one of the greatest issues for American Indians today is struggling with their identity and where they fit in this world. What some may see here as melodramatic racism is actually a very real stigma that many ""mixed-bloods"" have to face. In the end, this facet of the film makes it an important one, and a decent addition to the woefully inadequate genre of Native American film.Eddie Spears is excellent - I hope to see him get more work. If only Indians could get roles in films where their ethnicity was not the primary character."
4,Black Cloud is a must own in your Native American film collection,I attended the premier in Connecticut and talked at length with Rick Schroder about his project as writer/director. It was shot on a small budget but the result is amazing. The storyline is authentic and the cast and acting is excellent. Lead actor Eddie Spears (Lower Brule) is spectacular and believable. It's alchemy on film. Buy this movie!
3,"Ok, but not great!","I hate to say this because I support and love indian films. But, this one was a bit of a disappointment. The acting wasn't very good. Russel Means did the best he could with the script. It was kind of a rip off of Rocky Balboa set in Native American culture.It's worth watching once, but don't expect A+ quality."
3,colorful contemporary,wish it had more interaction with the wonderful characters beautiful landscapes less fighting.but that is what the movie was about.........
3,Average movie,I was disappointed with this movie. The acting was not great and the storyline was a bit predictable.
5,Not About the Doll,"Maybe a little at the end, but what I'm really looking to do is to SHUT EVERYBODY UP. I know you people are going to bash me cause of this or whatever, but this ""war"" is interfering with people ACCUALLY trying to find out about the stupid doll! SHUT UP ALREADY!!! I have seen you people on every item that I review, and I'm ashamed I have to say this in a review where you're supposed to talk about the doll, but someone has to stop you. NO ONE CARES. I like myscene and bratz, but I don't bash them or say anything to people that do bash them. What are you trying to do?????? YOU CAN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WORTHWHILE! SHUT UP!!Back to the doll: I love her!! Her long, red hair goes perfectly with the sea-green of her outfit. The zebra print is a perfect accessory!! I think the skirt has a little ballerina effect, don't you? I love it all!!!"
2,Her outfit is kind of pointless,"I thought Roxxi liked wearing dark colors,but this seems to be more of phoebe's style.I'm a roxxi fan,but not this roxxi.Her outfit is just.....not her.I agree with that person who does not like her outfit.""Goth girl14:A goth who likes bratz."
5,OMG I LOVE IT,"I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE ITAfter having a hideous view of the Cloe doll, I doubted this collection. But Roxxi redeemed Cloe's mistake, and now I love it!!!!!! SHE IS SOOO PRETTY!!!!Also, whatever this ""doll war"" is, people who aren't in it don't want to know. Please keep that info to your selves. I'm trying to write a review and I see ""DONT SUPPORT HER!"" ""be my friend!"" etc. So stop it now before I get really mad, please.-Candy"
5,This Roxxi is so cute!,This Roxxi is so chic the zebra top and bottom are cuteathouth she looks better without the crown!RoxxiPhoebeMeyganFiannaSasha
5,COOL DOLL :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :),I LOVE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHE IS SO PRETTY AND SO COOOLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SHE IS A PRETTY PRICESS!!! I LOVE HER!!!!!!!SHE IS MY FAVORITE DOLL!!!!!!
1,wat happened to her???,"i have always known roxxi as ""the evil twin"" but now they make her as aprincess??? it doesnt make sense at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont buy her. their are betterroxxis out there. at least much better than this one. take my advice and dont buy it!"
2,Not a heavy hooded sweatshirt,"I bought this hooded sweatshirt thinking it was going to be of really good quality, it's very thin and not a heavy-duty sweatshirt at all. I'm very disappointed with the quality. If you're looking for a light weight, thin sweatshirt then this is the sweatshirt for you. Blah."
3,"Very baggy, but if that is your style, this is for you","I would recommend this to someone who either wears baggy clothing or is planning to layer several articles of clothing underneath due to cold weather. I ordered a large size (which is the size I usually wear), and the shoulders of the product were about an inch or two too broad on either size. The joint where the arms connect to the trunk of the hoodie are huge (hence it looks baggy). Apart from the size issue, the product is great - it is soft on the inside and has a comfortable front pocket and hood."
3,Neck is too small,"Just your average hooded sweatshirt. My problem is that the hole for your head is too small. I had to tear them significantly to put them on (I bought three). I don't know if this is the intended size or if some kid in the factory had a bad day, but I'm betting most people will have to tear it a little bit."
4,sweater material perfect. fast arrival.,"Ordered this sweater for a set of sorority standards. Condition perfect, delivery quick, material strong."
3,Pointy hood.,"As someone else wrote, the hood is pointy which doesn't grab me. Also, I bought Columbia Blue, and the color that I received is lighter than the color that shows on my computer screen. For some reason, the front seems to fall a little lower than the back. Although my boyfriend is definitely not bigger than an XL, he felt he needed an XXL, because he wants it to be longer. It fit him nicely around the shoulders and chest."
1,way to tight on the neck for a extra large....,"I bought an extra large Russell Athletic Men's Dri-Power Hooded Pullover Fleece Sweatshirt,Graphite and let me start off by saying I don't have a fat neck. I put the jacket on and I felt as if I was being choked... so if some one wants to buy this item I suggest getting a size bigger or just not buying it at all. I had to rip the neck part to where it. If I put the hood on it just looks funny now, sigh. how depressing."
2,Not satisfied,"We needed 3 of this type of Sweatshirt and found one Big 5 but were unable to find the other 2 so we ordered them online from Amazon.com. The ones that we ordered were not as good of quality and thinner in weight, so was dissapointed in them. I don't think that I will be ordering anything more through Amazon.com."
2,Fabric Pills badly.,"Size is true, heavyweight material but pills after a couple washes badly. I have always bought Russell brand but never again. I purchased Hanes and am extremely satisfied with all their products."
5,Great Tie!,"I have a very large neck (shirts that have to button at the neck must be either altered or custom made), and it's not easy to find a tie that will fit comfortably. Elite Solid's extra-long tie did the job perfectly. The tie is beautifully made and very attractive. This is my tie place from now on!"
1,A Total Waste,"This program really rates no stars, but that is not possible, so it gets one. Buying it, is a waste of money. Watching it, is a waste of an hour. Much of the soundtrack is virtually unintelligible. The ""incidental"" music runs almost continuously and at a volume that interferes with hearing the spoken words. The words themselves are frequently hard to understand. The selection of visuals available to the production was apparently limited: the same ones are used over and over and frequently have no relationship to the soundtrack. The on-camera host is almost constantly in motion and often talks to the camera over his shoulder. There is nothing new in the content that has not been readily available in print for years."
4,A Pleasant Family Movie,"This was a lighthearted sequel to It's A Wonderful Life, one of my favorite movies. This story could have been a little better if they dwelt on some of the lessons the people should have learned. Love and family are the most important thing in life, and it should have stood out a little more. The teacher and coach were too hard on a grieving boy. At least it ends on a good note. The message is no one is perfect and we should put people first. God can forgive. I think kids will like this movie."
5,Cute!,Goes well with the Jeep it's on. Looks so funny when it snows. Glad we got two in case we lose one.
3,a bit fade in the print,"The only thing that is not perfect with the product itself is that the print in a bit faded out, ie you cannot see that it is a smiley when you look at it from ~4 meters distance.Otherwise it has a nice fit over my antenna, feels nice and if it wasn't for the fade print the score would be 5 stars"
5,Most beautiful soundtrack ever,"This soundtrack is by far the most beautiful score I have ever heard. A friend of mine let me borrow this CD and I just fell in love with it. I haven't seen the movie in a very long time, but it is soothing music that both makes your heart happy and ache all at the same time. I loved other scores from James Horner (Field of Dreams and Legends of the Fall), and other artists like Rachel Portman, and Thomas Newman, but this CD absolutely surpasses them all."
3,Pre-school Years,"This is a decent book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is interested in seriously introducing the Montessori homeschool methods to their small children. A good portion of the book is telling you about Maria Montessori and her life/her teaching. You can find that on the internet. Towards the end of the (very thin) book, there are simple ideas to do with your pre-schooler. Again, you can find it all on the internet and much more."
3,Interesting ideas but not easy to use,"If you are homeschooling your children or have only one child or have a way to dedicate some space for the Montessori ""school"" area, I'd say this book is quite useful. If not, it is quite difficult to implement many of the ideas in this book. There were some ideas I liked and was able to try them successfully at home. For example: my 3yr old daughter liked the 'walking on a line' exercise. We would make different letters and she would have fun trying to balance while walking over the lines. It became a challenge for her and she;d want to practice it often. We also tried some variations of the 'blind-fold and weigh tablets' exercise. We turned it into blindfolding and trying different textures and guessing what I had placed in front of her. There are a few more exercises I have tried and probably a few more I can try but more than half the book is not going to be that useful to me. Still a decent book for the price I got it at."
5,Home School,I purchased this book since I will home school my grandson this coming winter session. I found it very informative and easy to read and follow. I couldn't agree more with the Montessori method.
5,So practical and easy!,"I loved this book! I used it more than almost all the other Montessori, parenting books. Full of great, easy, practical ideas!"
2,Disappointing & Out-dated,"This book supposedly has been updated & revised. I found it to be very out-dated (50's & 60's photo/graphics of children) and (many remarks about etiquette & being graceful). Granted I want my children to be well mannered, but this reads like something from ""leave it to beaver"" Some good tips of things to do with your pre-schoolers, but nothing out of the ordinary that one wouldn't think to do of on their own, or read about in a parenting magazine."
5,A must own,"I am fortunate enough to be able to be a stay at home with my children because I want my kids to stay at home as long as possible (while they are young) so they can fully appreciate the family dynamic. Because I stay at home, my family and I are living off a single income and cannot afford to put our children in the Montessori program. I am still interested in the Montessori philosophy, and wanted to try to incorporate it here at home. I checked this book out from the library just to see how applicable it would be, and I found that this is a great, not complicated introduction to the Montessori method. The activities are great and realistic for little ones to explore and learn, and will be useful to them in the long run. They also don't require alot of ""shopping"" so it can be very affordable as well. I'm very excited to help my children learn with this book. I'm going out to buy this book right away!"
2,Mixed feelings,"So I feel weird about this book. I am down with Montessori ""schooling"", but this book didn't give me anything new, in fact most of it was pretty dated. And much of the theory was very common sense, such as how to show your child how to do something, I was like ""um...yeah, no kidding"". Also, I don't know if this is because it is so dated(40's?) but many of the tasks for ""3 to 5"" year olds my 1 1/2 year old can do, or is already learning, I felt like much of the things this book guides you to show your two year old, my bobbler already gets. There is even a part where it suggests we start teaching colors at age 3, my kid knows all his colors even though he can't say them. I am not bragging here, it was just weird. Also the ""busy board"" is put together with upholstery tacks, and I am pretty sure I wouldn't want my kid playing with something that included tacks.There was NOTHING here that I couldn't find on Montessori sites, or mom blogs."
5,Great tool for teaching at home,"This book really opened my mind to teaching the early school years at home. Preschools all around are more and more competitive and they only focus on academics. This book teaches that first the child needs to master the world around him/her and then they will become great students. The example exercizes the book gives are all great. Another plus, is that monst of the activities can be done with things that you may already have around the house. I really liked this book and my daughter has caught on to the learning and she really loves our school sessions at home."
5,Teaching Montessori in the Home: The preschool years,"This is a wonderful book full of info on how to teach your child using the Montessori Method in your own home. There are directions for making most of the maerials yourself, others can be purchased inexpensively. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Montessori education."
3,"Been there, done that","I have to admit I was disappointed with this book. I had no idea it would be more of a cookbook for basic play activities for 3-5 year olds. I am sure I will be able to find a couple of novel ideas in here, but really I think as much can be found in an Internet search."
5,Fab new Bratz!(LGP3LNC here),"This brat is so . . . . . . . .FAB!I would recomend getting this.Don`t believe me?Here are the reasons why to get this great doll:A jeweled genie bottleDenim Capris and a square pattern shirt(This is apropriate,so pesky parents have NO reason to write reviews that dis bratz,because,truthfully,my mom does`nt care that much for bratz she just tells me I can choose which dolls I like .But she actually liked this one!)A geneirific necklace for you.Those are my reasons.Thank you for reading.Merry Christmas.LGP3LNCEverything LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCH SQUARED"
4,barbie sucks,that person who said bratz were glued to boxs were wrong.i get my bratz dolls in two scets i get the doll out.well maybe not two scets three lol
2,A Bratz Letdown,"As an older Bratz lover and collector, I view the Genie Magic collection as somewhat belittling for such a fashion-forward doll. I am in high school, and my favorite Bratz were the older ones with bolder colors and gothy make-up. The newer Bratz are a bit on the cheap side, and these Genie Magic dolls are a new low. The clothes are ugly, the make-up is ghetto fabulous. Bratz have always been Ghetto Fabulous, but this make-up is over-glossy and Barbie-cheap. Maybe your typical 10-year-old will like this doll, but it really won't make her stand out in the playpen. Almost every girl has a ""cute"" doll. But very few have unorthodox dolls with personality, dolls that stand out and get lookovers. If you're going to spend over $10 on a doll, make sure it's different from what everyone else has?Erm, that is all.CHOW! And don't touch the sushi.XOXOXO,Roxanne"
5,The Best Toy EVER!!!,"This toy is the greatest. All the accessories and the STIKers can make for at least a million different figures!Fun: Simply fun! You can pose them, play around with them, take pictures of them and put them on the website(at www.stikfas.com)Educational: You can use you creativity here! Develop your imagination, then put some paints for your own customized pieceDurability: Solid plastic. Once the hand broke in half. But it's pretty solid.(If it breaks, you can contact hasbro's customer service and trade your braken one for another one)"
5,Fun and intresting,These toys are great. My son loves these and he is not rich. You can decorate them and use them for any thing your mind can imagin. The only way you won't like them is if you don't have an imagination.
3,American Ninja 2: The confrontation/American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt,"This is a nice move to have on hand to watch when there is nothing else out there. The fight scenes seems staged. After watching people like Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung this is slow, and the story line is not the greatest."
1,Author never visited my highly rated town!,"My town, Elko, NV, was rated #1. Mr Crampton did not bother to visit here. If he had it would never have made any good list. It was a boom town of trailers, pick ups, and four wheelers, populated by trashy people. It is now a bust town. Elko is only good if you want to buy a trailer the bank has repoed."
2,"Not bad, but limited",I was hoping for better information and a lot more of it. Trying to get 100 towns in one book was too much. I wish I had found something with more expense information in it.
3,"SAME STORY, DIFFERENT TITLE","Boy, I really dislike writing this review. Why? Because I've really enjoyed the first four in this series. Well, ""The way to Glory"" was showing a bit of a slowdown, but nothing like ""Some Golden Harbor""!Yeah, there's some action, but it's the same kind of action you're seen time and time again in the other books. Character growth? Forget it! There has been little or no change in any of the relationships since ""The Far Side of the Stars"". Leary's still just a big old playboy who just happens to be a terrific navigator and ship fighter. Mundy isn't much better, same old robot in a human shell.The worst part about this is it's starting to get really boring, and that's a shame since it started off so well. I think the best thing Drake can do is either kill them all off, abandon the it or put some real changes into the storyline. But I suppose as long as we keep buying this churned out crud he'll keep writing it.Neutral on this one."
2,Fool's Gold,"Unfortunately, Some Golden Harbor did not appeal to my senses. The plot, characters, and battle scenes were monotonous and bland. The political complexities ended up being linear. A has problem with B, so shoot both A and B and C wins.Very sad considering I have enjoyed the Lt. Leary series up to this book.I felt that the problem began when the majority of the focus ended up on Adele with her anti-social behavior and robotic outlook on life. You know what you get with her and because she is devoid of emotions, the book followed suit. Also, the excessive use of ""a Mundy of Chatsworth"" or ""my word as a Mundy of Chatsworth"" was very distracting.Definitely read the first 3 books, maybe the fourth, but skip this one."
2,Some Stagnate Pond,"This is a hard review to write for someone who loved the other stories in this series. But really, don't bother. I've had this book for months and reading more than a page or two a week is a chore. And I'm only halfway through. It's that slow. Nothing of any interest at any level has happened yet. I really should give this book a one-star rating, but the last half has to be better. Doesn't it?"
3,A Good Addition To The Series,A good addition to the series of space books. Drake has a style all his own.
4,RCN Still Sailin',"David Drake borrows from events in Italy, circa 5th Century BC, merges it with elements from Patrick O'Brien's novels and sets it in space. This 5th book in the ""RCN Series"" continues the adventures of Commander Daniel Leary and his signals officer/spy/librian friend Adele Mundy. Together, with their shipmates from the corvette Princess Cecile, they confound the corrupt politicians on four planets, stop an army from invading an allied world and shoot down a blockading cruiser. The story is a little slow at several points, because the good ship & crew end up traveling back & forth several times between three planets, to obtain weapons, crewmen and even a destroyer. The author's premise for space travel appears plausible and makes readers feel they're immersed a ""Horatio Hornblower in space"" yarn. While it's a decent stand alone novel, it's best appreciated if you've read the previous four books."
3,The series is going downhill,"The Lieutenant Leary series started out well with lots of action. The latest entry is a snooze. Little action, and the characters are starting to be wooden and one-dimensional. Adele Mundy is turning into a robot, and how many times do we have to hear that a hint of a smile is all she can do because of her emotional state? All Lieutenant Leary seems to want to do is hang out on the ship's surface in matrix space. The supporting characters have even less depth. They all have hard looks on their faces, but everyone knows that they mean business. I'll give this series one more try with the next one. I hope it's better, or I'm done."
4,Jaws 2,A pretty good read but not as good as the first one.The story is pretty much the same'A Shark after people.and the shark gets it in the end. for anyone that has not read any Jaws books i would suggest you start with the first Jaws because it is without a doubt the best one.now am off to read a new Elvis book!
3,Fiendin' For More,"This is a pretty good CD don't get me wrong, but Professor X (RIP to him and Sugar Shaft) just could not hold a record by himself. Although the Close the Crackhouse is a dream collaboration, it's not enough to warrant classic status of the CD. The guy will always be in my book as icon (being part of the incredible X-Clan crew form the 90's). They put out an album a few years ago BTW (minus a few members of course). I am happy with this purchase though."
1,Poor Effort and in Error,"I agree with ""Seeker"" and others. Not only is Protestantism poorly represented, so also is the ancient Eastern Orthodox Church - and, each of the 5 references is in error. If you are looking for a ""reference"" source to refer to and recommend to others: do NOT consider this book (even cheapest price, like I did), unless your desire is to pass along their errors and bias. TV Fame doesn't make experts."
1,This book is a biased viewpoint,"I found out all to late the book was written by christian pastors, and quickly discovered the book had a biased slant to it. The book focuses greatly on the Abrahamic religions (what a surprise) and says little about any others.I was hoping for a anyalisis of the structure of religion, how they are formed, and all that. This is like a big brochure to sign up for a religion of ""your"" choice (Christanity being the correct choice in the eyes of the author.)The book is little more than a reference guide of the major religions out there, and deleves no further than that, other than to preach that religion is pure good and can do no evil (the authors must never watch the news or read a newspaper)This is the kind of book you borrow from the library for quick reference. Don't waste your money."
2,Stating the Obvious,"The title says it all. Religion is for dummies. Well intentioned but dummies nonetheless. I still love religious people though. Wait, I forgot, I'm an atheist I don't feel love. Only religious people love and that's because they know God and God is love. There is no love without God, a specific God written in ancient children's books preached by supremacist masters. Forgive me the sarcasm but thinking that you know there is a God and that you personally know that God is the ultimate arrogance."
3,Great For Beginners,I found this book to be most helpful in setting up an aquarium and maintaining water quality. It also gives great tips and insight into what look for in keeping your guppy healthy and with breeding. The color photographs were a great tool. The book was not too advanced and never got too technical like others I've read.
5,A great story of how 1 man can stand up to a whole county,"A extremly well-written, evolution vs. bible peice, Jerome Lawrence goes to extends to prove how 1 man(a schoolteacher, in this case) can stand up to the beleifs of a whole county, saying & teaching what he rightfully beleives is right. After the schoolteacher goes to court for teaching evolution against the bible, to great lawyers duke it out in court. Jerome Lawrence writes a beatiful book about how one man can stand up for what he beleives to be right"
2,Monkeying with the Monkey Trail,"Almost all of the scientific evidence brought forward during the time of the trial has been discarded.There was another very disturbing thing about Inherit the Wind. It caricatured Christians as self-righteous, intolerant and mean-spirited. The two leading Christian characters in the film rant like lunatics much of the time. Phillip E. Johnson's bookDEFEATING DARWINISM BY OPENING MINDS (available at Amazon) writes about how Christians were stereotyped.The play did get one thing right. It is indeed a `crime' (to use their word) to censor an opposing view in the classroom. This lesson has been lost on secular humanists today who attempt to censor any evidence contrary to their dogmatic belief in evolution."
2,A Classic - But Biased,"This was a must read for a college literature class. Although it is referred to as classic literature, it is very biased against Christians and those who believe in Intelligent Design. It makes christians look like the bully bad guys."
3,Its cool,this book was cool but not the greatest! but the story is good! i have to read it for school!
2,NOT the Scopes Trial,"""Inherit the Wind"" is a gross misrepresentation of the Scopes Trial. The entire thing was orchestrated by the Darwinists as a test case. The law on which the trial was based was merely symbolic; it wasn't meant to be enforced. The trial was anything but dramatic. It was an open and shut case: the prosecution won and Scopes was fined. The law was eventually revoked. Those who see the Scopes Trial as a victory of Science and Reason over religious dogmatism and antiquated fundamentalism don't know the facts."
4,Recomended,"Based upon the Scopes Monkey Trial in Dayton, TN, Inherit the Wind looks at the trial as a battle over the suppression of ideas that is reminiscent of Arthur Miller's The Crucible. However, it also includes some interesting thoughts reagarding fundamentalist interpretations of the bible. Some of these were taken from the actual testimony from the trial, although the book does take some liberties with history in order to make its point. Its themes are universal and the book/play definitely brings up some ideas that are still worthy of consideration today."
5,John Grisham meets the 1920's,"Like most I had to read this for school too. It is a great play and one that you can actually think about. Being an actor also gave me a different respect in that I saw the differene between the story and the true facts. A wonderful book for drama and english teachers alike. I could read it again and again. Like a John Grisham book it keeps you on your toes, like a play it makes you sweat until the end."
2,Not impressed,"This was more of a Boston accent book then a ""Yankee"" accent book. If you want info on that then its right on the money."
2,Ending is obvious,"I generally have liked the Jack Reacher books, and while totally too violent, at least keep you guessing as to the ending, which is usually fairly plausible. This is the only reason I have given it 2 stars instead of one. The ending is very obvious, as to who the killer is and like all of the other people wrote, it is totally implausible that none of the FBI agents would have noticed what was going on. The whole method of killing was ridiculous and made no sense and then .... now, for those who don't want to know the ending, don't read further........to blame it on hypnosis is ludicrous and a simplistic way to try to tie knots together. Obviously Lee Child doesn't know a thing about hypnosis, because it has been proven that while you can make people do silly tricks on stage, you can't make them do things that go against their character or will and the concept of these post hypnotic suggestions is totally bizarre. Maybe the novel should be called The Stepford Army Girls."
1,Not very ....Blind,"I'm reading all this authors books in order. I like his style short straight sentences (He isn't into the adjective game with adjectives about adjectives on top of adjectives), the good guys are slightly flawed but prevail,the bad guys fail and the stories are involved and interesting. Simple straight comfort food for an afternoon read. The reason I rated this title so low is also simple. The whole story is about the identification of the bad ""guy"" but the person was identifiable by the reader very very.....very early in the book. Anyone that thinks about what they are reading will have to read the following 2/3 of the book knowing the ending. Very, very, ....very tedious."
1,Silly and Dumb,"Not much to say about this book. In a review of another Reacher book (""Echo Burning""), I said that these books were fun reads despite their many drawbacks as novels (careless and sloppy writing, no attention to factual accuracy, one dimensional characters, plots that rely on coincidence etc). This book is not fun, just stupid.The plot is literally incredible in many respects. The mysterious villain is telegraphed. The facts are wrong (my favorite: Fort Dix as a Marine Corps base--at the time the novel was written, it was an Army and Guard/Reserve base as it had been for over 80 years). If you can even faintly buy the ending and explanation I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that I could sell to you. Don't read it. It will only encourage the author to do it again."
1,Worst Reacher yet,"Did I miss something. Two books ago, Jack saves an FBI agent who just happens to be the daughter of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and grand daughter to the President. In that book Reacher came in contact with the head of the FBI and Chairman of the JCS. So now I am to believe to get Reacher to work for them (FBI) they threaten his girl-friend.What world does the author live in, in the real world one call to the agent he saved would have heads rolling..."
5,good one !,it was great! have read all the other jack reacher novels and this rates up there with the best...i liked it alot
4,Good read!,"Good read! Jack Reacher is an odd character, but Child makes him believable. The story is full of righteous action. Looking forward to the next Reacher book...Echo Burning."
4,Good book,"I was the usually well written book, and I will get the next one too. I was a great price as well."
5,A different Teacher story,"I really enjoyed the story, but this one is a little different. A little more cerebral""whodunnit"" and a little less action. Jack must also resolve issues of growing roots vs a nomadic life style. Book is still fast paced and won't disappoint the Reacher fan"
3,running blind,"story line was good, at least he did not kill at least 6 people in the story single handed, ending was quick and somewhat shallow, book ok"
3,The Visitor,"I also fell for it and ordered The Visitor, and started reading it right after I finished Running Blind. I thought I picked up the wrong book. Yes, it's a dirty trick, and I was a victim. Shame on you Lee Child. Maybe next they'll retitle ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" as ""She's Upstairs"" and everyone will buy it."
1,Overblown and half-baked.,"This is a great novel for adolescent sex addicts who 1. don't know anything about the military, 2. think the best way to keep a job is to insult your employers, 3. think it's cool to wear the same clothes day after day, 4. would like to commit sexual harrasment themselves.The dialogue is simple and extensive, which keeps the pace fast.What is most astonishing are reviews on the cover calling Mr. Child's efforts a 'masterpiece' and 'spectacular'. My response: a roll of the eyes and moan of ""Good Grief!""."
3,Decent Reacher tale - not the best,"Of the first four Jack Reacher novels, this one is the weakest. I'm certainly not a reader who avidly tries to figure out all of the twists and turns before the big reveals at the end. I will quote this from the review: ""The ending will come as a complete surprise to even the most careful reader"". If you are even paying half-attention to the story you will figure out the killer early on. I looked down at my Kindle when I figured it out and I had read about 23% of the book. Childs actually points it out fairly clearly. So when he unleashed the reveal at the end, I shrugged instead of gasped as I knew who it was for most of the book.I also felt the relationship between Reacher and Jodie was completely different in this book. You would be hard-pressed to tell they had secretly been in love for 15 years based on their interactions here. Worth a read, but not the best in the series so far."
2,Disappointing,"I've read about all the Jack Reacher books and I was terribly disappointed with this one. It tried to be a ""whodunnit"" and was short on the usual Reacher mayhem. That in itself isn't terrible, but this story seemed very mechanically cranked out, got awfully repetitive and after a while I really didn't care what happened. Although the ending is a big surprise, getting there wasn't worth it."
5,Running Blind / The Visitor,Lee Child has a UK version and an American version for all his books. Running Blind is the American version and The Visitor is the UK version. Same book...different country.
4,Lee Child-Running Blind,"Child uses the same character but each book is a different story. Although there are occasional references to previous story lines, the setting and direction are completely new."
3,Mid 1/3 was very slow,Way too much about how hot is is in south west Texas. We knew that.The mid 1/3 wasvery slow. However the end moved fast.I have read 4 previous books by Child and liked them.This review was supposed to be for ECHO BURNING !!
4,"Good book, poor kindle formating","I find the Jack Reacher books to be a quick and enjoyable read. This book is no different. It's not a deep book. Just good ol' fashion adventure and action fun. The story has enough mystery to keep it interesting, but not so convoluted and arcane to tax the mind that might want some relaxation after a tough day at work.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the Kindle Version is formatted badly. There are no indents at the beginning of each paragraph (it's all left justified), making dialog exchanges and determining where new paragraphs begin a little to tricky at times. Hopefully we'll get a better formated version to ""update"" the one I just bought"
5,Good guys DO finish first.,"Jack Reacher is at it again in this 4th book from Lee Child. He does an unsolicited good deed and has the FBI all over him as a result. While the Bureau doesn't look particularly good in this book, Reacher certainly does. It is sad that he can't settle in with the love of his life, but if he could where would that leave the readers? Another great book that expands the Reacher character and points the way to further adventures. Tight plotting, great character development and no let downs keep Child's books at the top of the list for me."
3,Not the best Jack Reacher,I enjoy all the Jack Reacher novels but this is my least favourite. Mostly worth reading for continuity and understanding of the character.
4,Fast Mover,A fast paced book that is hard to put down once started. Excellent character portrayal. Keeps you wanting more and more.
2,A Silly Mystery,"What can i say about a book in which i can pick out the murderer a quarter of the way through it? I'm used to LeCarre, Ambler, Greene, Sandford and others of far better quality. Child wants the reader to believe the FBI is run by morons. While this may be the popular view, I don't subscribe to it and neither will countless others after they think about what this book suggests. I can't detail the offending matters without giving away the plot, but trust me: you don't want to waste your time or money on this. Contact me and i'll send you my copy. It won't be in my library long."
3,Jack Reacher Returns,"The latest book in the Jack Reacher novels, Lee Child has penned an enjoyable thriller. Ex-MP Reacher, although he was blackmailed by the FBI into taking the job, finds that his hunt for the vicious serial killer of young women who were at one time enlisted in the US Army, is a job he is more than qualified to undertake. Well developed characters, and what seems like behind-the-scenes knowledge of the subject matter make this an entertaining read."
2,Running on empty,"The fourth book in the Reacher series lacks the action, pacing and plausibilty of the earlier novels. A careful reader sees the ending coming long before one should. Like Reacher, the book feels burdened by house, girlfriend and responsibility. Put him back on the road, before he stops being as entertaining as he was in the earlier books."
3,"I love Jack Reacher, but.....Audiobook","Most of the Jack Reacher books are above average, however...this one is NOT.I guess every book can't be that good.There is some good enough Jack Reacher action, but the method of serial killer is just silly.So if you have never read a LC book with JR, don't start with this one.His first book, Killing Floor was good, but too wordy and too much detail about the money. That doesn't seem to be a problem in his later books.I even liked Nothing to Lose - which got awful reviews."
2,running blind,"very angry, was told by friends to purchase books through amazon, being a jack reacher follower and having read all his stories, i thought i had a new venture in running blind only to read it is the same story as THE VISITOR!!, what's going on?."
3,"fun read, strange ending","This one started out well. I was soooo curious to know how and why the killer was able to kill 4 women in the same bizarre way (10 gallons of green paint in a bathtub) and getaway with no evidence left behind. It was a good setup.Other amazon reviewers have not recieved this book as warmly as others in the series written by Lee Child, and I too thought the set-up failed to deliver a good final end, but I haven't given up checking out other Jack Reacher stories, read excellently by Dick Hill...yet."
4,Great Book!,"My first Jack Reacher novel and all I can say is WHAT A RIDE! Just when you think you know what's going to happen next, you're thrown a curve ball and it's off and running again. I can't wait to go back and read the previous books!"
4,Good book,It was a very good book! I cant wait for the next book in the series. Reacher at his best.
5,Great Read,"I hae read several Reacher novels, and fnd them different from the usal run-of-the -mill detective novels. He is unique in his anti-maerialism personna. The story is fast-paced and entirely readable"
2,Not the best Reacher,"An interesting idea for a crime spree, but this is one padded story with a fairly predictable ""twist"", especially as Reacher books go. And there are some scenes that make almost ZERO sense. If you're a Reacher addict, you'll read it anyway. If you're not, save your time and money."
1,Rip Off,"I have all of the Jack Reacher books on my Kindle. When I saw this title I thought I had missed one. Luckily I aways read some of the reviews and noticed it was retitled. Thanks to most of the reviewers, I saved a duplication. Dirty pool on the publisher. I wonder if Lee Child is aware of this."
1,Dirty Trick,"Running Blind is a great book, as are all of Lee Child's books. Retitling it and selling it as The Visitor is a dirty trick on those of us always on the lookout for a new Jack Reacher book."
1,Warning: Rip off,"This book is ""Running Blind"" under a different title. It should be illegal to sell this book. I feel so cheated."
1,Publisher deception,I've read every Lee Child novel with Jack Reacher and was set to buy this one. Thank goodness I looked here and found it is just RUNNING BLIND with a new title. The one star I gave it is for the publisher. RUNNING BLIND gets five stars.
2,Way beyond believable,"This is one of those mysteries where you keep reading to learn how the killer did it. You just know that knowing how and why will tie the whole story together. Unfortunately, Lee Child apparently didn't have a clue about how to pull everything together when he started this book. Child's explanation might make sense in some alternate universe, but certainly not here. The ending wouldn't have been any less believable if the crimes had been blamed on space aliens.Others have already commented on Jack Reacher's poor hygiene. Instead of carrying just a folding toothbrush, couldn't the poor guy at least carry a duffel bag? That wouldn't tie him down too much ... and he could at least have a change of underwear and socks. This should have given me a clue to what was to come ... a stinky ending."
4,Jack Reacher #4,"I have recently been turned on to Lee Child and his larger than life character Jack Reacher. He is larger than life but he is also grounded, realistic, and approachable. Thus far it is a great read, real diversionary and a wonderful escape from an ever increasing maddening and pressured real world; in fact Jack likes to get away from that same world."
5,Another Home Run!,"If you love a fast paced read, then you have to get to know Jack Reacher. Love the whole series."
4,"Excellent work. Interesting plot, characters, twists.",Great storytelling. More than one plot developing at the same time. Mr Child ranks among my favorites.
4,"Jack Reacher May Be Running Blind, But He's Oh, So Good!","For those such as myself, who were a bit disappointed with Lee Child's ""Tripwire,"" take heart! Jack Reacher is back at his very best; not too smart, not too slow witted, but just right. Also, he's still very capable of handling most adversaries and charming all (well, almost all) women and pissing off most men. It is a fast paced thriller in search of a serial killer which takes many twists and turns, but entertains all the way. It leaves you a bit exhausted, but exhilarated at the same time! No author seems to get along with the FBI, but this book has a lot of fun with their procedures, while bending a few military rules along the way. Read it!"
1,Quite inplausible.,I double if the FBI Blake and dearfield are realistic characters. It seems really stupid. I guess the hypnotism thing when the women can't remember what happen. The audio book reacher sounds slow and stupid too. Also mr child style is very naggy. Kept repeating the actions. I would expect Reacher to be efficient. So it seems unrealistic too.
3,Lots of descriptive travel etc.,"You discover why excessive descriptives, but could literally skip read through much of this. Not normal narrative for Child books"
4,"Mr. Child coninues to hold suspense in the palm of his hand, revealing the perp only during the last pages.","A well contrived mystery, even though the MO seems a bit implausable. I am more than half-way through the book and find myself looking forward to the next page."
4,Entertaining,"If you like the idea of a farely predictable action movie put to print, this is a book you'd enjoy. It is fast moving and entertaining. Not a bad book, just simple."
3,My View,This book I thought just came up short from his previous ones I have read not as much action nor smart comments from Jack
4,Good book,Suspenseful story. This was the first book I read by this author. I would definitely read another. Hopefully this will become a movie!
4,Great read,"Like all of Lee Child's - Jack Reacher books, they are fast paced and and often have a twist towards the end."
4,"jack reacher, running blind",love all the lee child books with Jack Reacher. Have read at least five and plan on reading the rest of the series.Would reccomend them to anyone who like mysteries.
4,Love These Books,"I love the Jack Reacher books. This one was great, but maybe not as good as the first three. I am reading them in order."
1,Bad formatting,I downloaded a badly formatted kindle version of the book. No indented paragraphs. No indentions at all! I really felt cheated but I'm new to the series so I don't feel so bad as those who read it under a different title. This is a prime example of the publisher being greedy.
1,Absurd Novel,"Lee Child is disappointing. When reading his other novels, you are sometimes uncomfortable with what you suspect are cliches. In this one he writes about my home state, and it isn't simply cliche, it is absurd. He is a Brit writing about Americans with a completely biased attitude. The plot line is absurd. I won't bother to read any more of his Jack Reacher novels."
2,Condition of book,"Running Blind was excellent, like all of Lee Child's books. The condition of the book was alittle less than I expected, but still very readable, not torn or pages missing."
2,Poor quality tapes and mediocre storyline,"We have enjoyed listening to the Reacher series on unabridged audioboks. This one was on cassette tapes and they sounded like a distant echo chamber with muffled narration. In addition the story line was fluffed out with the meat being less than 40% of the time. I believe we have heard 5 others which were much better than Running Blind and suggest you skip this one, particularly if it is a cassette audiobook."
3,Very Similar to The Poet by Michael Connelly,"This book is very similar to ""The Poet"" by Michael Connelly...except for the Edgar Allan Poe references. For The Poet, though, it was homicide detectives instead of woman miliary officers. But there are many similarities that makes you wonder if Child ripped it off. I would name more similarities but don't want to spoil plot for both books that were both good reads. Ending was kind of disappointing but as always, this book kept me interested and had me laughing all the way through. Jack's lack of social graces are perfect and I always love when he makes other people feel stupid when they try to prove them wrong. This book is not as strong as the others in the series, in my opinion, but definitely recommended."
3,One novel - two titles?,"What book is ""The Visitor"" from Lee Child? Looks like ""Runnig Blind"". Under different titles same books??"
2,"Deaf, Dumb and Blind...","...you'd have to be to enjoy this book. Okay, I know it's fiction, but sooo many aspects of this book are ridiculously unbelievable. It started off with promise, but it seems as if he lost his way and just needed to finish the book. I've read the first three in this series so far. I'm glad I did, because if I had read this one first, I wouldn't have bothered with any more of his books. He's as awesome writer and his writing style keeps you on the edge of your seat, but I fell off while reading this one! Skip this one and move on to the next in the series. Hopefully, he recovered from his writer's block in his subsequent novels."
2,Not realistic,"What woman finds a man who doesn't use toothpaste, deoderant, or clean underwear, and never changes clothes attractive? Maybe a cave woman. I couldn't enjoy the book thinking of the poor people in a car or on a plane with the reeking Jack. The ending with him, of course, with a single crashing blow breaking the neck of the killer and the F.B.I. saying ""now we own you"", well this part wasn't even a one star. The book had a lot of potential, but was disappointing."
1,"Money Back from Amazon,com","I would like to get my money back from Amazon.com. I paid out the price of the book plus postage, only to find that this was the English version of Running Blind that I had already bought from Amazon.com.How about it Amazon.com? To me, this looks like false advertising when you sell the same book with different titles.The Visitor (Jack Reacher, No. 4)"
2,Suspenseful at times but so very easy to solve...,"I'm not going to give anything away, but I had this one solved very early in the book. How could the great Jack Reacher and the FBI not be able to figure out this mystery? Honestly, it felt like Lee Child phoned this one in. I hope number five is better."
1,This IS 'Running Blind',"This is the same book as 'Running Blind'. If you own that title,(good book, by the way), don't waste your money on this."
2,Visitor in a new cover!!,I bought this with the two `Soft Target` novels by Conrad Jones (electric thrillers!) only to find that the storyline seemed way to familiar to be a Reacher book that I hadnt already read...low and behold it is the same as Visitor but renamed and rebound.....not very fair really on Lee Child fans...there is no mention on the cover of either book that they are the same...which is naughty to say the least.Good job my two other purchases were brilliant!!
3,Running Blind,Characters seemed stiff. Not like some of the newer Jack Reacher. Plot of story ended abruptly. Not as much detail in this story. Just an ok read. Really liked later Jack Reacher.
4,one of my favorite author,This book kind a left you up in the air guessing at the ending.....and the plot maybe just a little far-fetched.
4,Same old Reacher,I could write the same for all these books -- I just enjoy the main character. Will read more of these.
3,The visitor,The title is new but the book is the same as the pursuwader I think. I sent the visitor to a friend so I can't confirm the match 100% but it is definitely the same Reacher novel as another with a different title. Seems strange to give it a different cover.
5,Running Blind,"Lee Childs gets better with each mystery he writes. Only one negatgive, too much detail i.e., what the scenery is like, the weather etc. I like a book right to the point. Otherwise, excellent book!!!! Loved it."
5,Good job!!!,I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped in good time and good condition. I would buy again.
2,You can skip this one.,"I am a huge fan of the Jack Reacher novels, but this one is by far my least favorite. Not believable in the least."
1,"Perhaps the dumbest ""mystery"" I've ever read.","About 1/3 of the way into this book it's painfully obvious who the killer is. It couldn't be that obvious right? It had to be a red herring right? Well, it wasn't. I finished the book simply so that I could see if I'd been right. Throughout the whole book obvious red flags should have... WOULD have caught the attention of any characters with enough brain power to scramble eggs. It's as if Jack Reacher's IQ is the only one high enough to add two and two together. This is a DUMB book."
3,FOURTH REACHER NOVEL,"I am a fan of the Reacher series and this is the fourth book in the series and the fourth I have read. And I will keep going with the series, but I might not have gone on if this one was number one. It is far below the quality of the others. Jack Reacher is a loner but in this one it is too extreme. Hope for better in number five."
1,What it all boils down to is $,"I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that this was a ""retitled"" book. I use Kindle and couldn't figure out why it wasn't offered and was considering buying a hard copy -- Another copy. While I cannot wait to read the next true offering of the Reacher series I guess I'll have to consider this and all purchases as suspect. What a poor policy."
2,bad psychology!,"While fairly well-written for the thriller genre, this book contains some of the worst use of psychology I have ever encountered since the early '40s, when people really believed that hypnosis was this terrifying, all-powerful technique that could drive anyone to do anything. However, the science has since then progressed and even we the hoi poloi now know better. The most cursory research should have informed this author of the basic unsoundness of his murder method. His insistence on its use grated on my nerves and utterly destroyed any enjoyment I may have derived from the book. Characters are badly fleshed-out, awkwardly motivated, and flatter than a stack of pancakes. I guessed the murder's identity and the murder method one-third way through the book, thought to myself, Nah, it's too ridiculous, flipped to the end and Lo, I was right! What a waste of time."
4,Running Blind,Like all of Lee child it was enjoyable from beginning to end. Jack Reacher as always is was his hard nosed self.Jim Wright
3,Escapism,"A good air-trip novel. Read it, wish you were Jack, lauigh at the idea of Cruise as Reacher, and pass it on to a friend."
4,Jack Reacher definitely does not like the FBI,"Jack Reacher is living in his house at Garrison and still going out with the beautiful Jodie Garber that we met inTripwire (Jack Reacher, No. 3)when Reacher gets forced intohelping the FBI catch a serial killer. The killer seems to be targeting previously harassed women from the army but is that really what the murders are about.However when the FBI finds no evidence left at the scenes of the crimes and the victims are dying in undetermined ways Reacher needs to act quickly in orderto prevent any further killings from happening.The fourth in the series of Jack Reacher novels is fast paced with Reacher doing what he does best - killing bad people. However Jack definitelydoes not like the FBI.If you like Jack Reacher novels then this is deifnitely for you."
2,The Visitor,"A Racey book, which did not compel me to read on and finish.Found the character bold in some instances, and in others, weak"
1,An Action Comic for Ten-Year-Olds,"I read a lot, and some fraction of what I read is junk, but this book goes way past my junk tolerance level. Jack Reacher, the central character, is a mere cartoon. Some of the blurbs in the paperback edition compared Reacher to Dave Robicheaux or Spenser or Travis McGee, but each of these guys has a real, complex personality. Reacher just never comes alive. And it's hard to see how he could. He inhabits a book devoid of a single believable situation or person. It's an action comic for ten-year-olds, translated to prose."
3,"The Reacher we know and love, almost.","If you are new to the series Jack Reacher is a former Army MP, part Rambo and part Columbo, who wants nothing more than to travel around the country. Through plausible plot setups, Reacher finds himself in a position to help someone.This book revolves around Reacher being forced to help out the FBI to solve a pattern of gruesome murders. The serial killer seems to be 2 steps ahead of Reacher and the FBI, a very well planned out antagonist.I loved the way the story unravels; the evidence comes together without spoiling the ending and with plausibility. The only issue that I had was that the ending seemed a little rushed. The question throughout the book was how is the killer doing it, and at the very end the reader is told how in a very unsatisfying way. The how was very implausible and kind of a copout; seemed a little rushed.Worth reading, especially if you are a Jack Reacher fan, but not the book I would recommend for newcomers to the series."
3,"You've read one, you've read them all...","You've read one, you've read them all... Good read for passing time; easy, predictable but engaging at the same time."
4,I've been devouring these books,"Since December I'e read 4 or five of the ""Jack Reacher"" series. Their easy to read and hard to put down. Running blind was a pretty good read. it wasn't until 3/4 way thru did I start making guesses about the ending. I'd recommend it as part of the series."
5,2nd. to Killing Floor.,"IMO this was second only to the first book , The Killing Floor. I always find inaccurate comments in firearms=EX-Glock's do not have safties that ""click"". He is Brit, though. Standard very good character substance and interesting. They are pridictable, but always a fun read. I try to buy one a month, I have a difficult time not reading in 2-3 days"
3,Good Suspense,"As always, great suspense and characterization. Lee Child is a great wordsmith; does everything right to build setting, characters, and develop the story without ever wasting any events or even details of setting. It all comes together from beginning to end. HOWEVER, I really don't enjoy reading his sexual events. Yes, he always gets the girl, but, please, just leave an illusion there. I'm not interested in the sweaty details."
2,I agree ...,"... with R. H. Oakley's review, which said in part, ""Enough clues are given that most readers will realize who the killer is and how the killer pulls it off half way through the book. And the means used to pull it off would not be believed in a comic book. The sheer impossibility was so great that once I realized what the answer was, I skipped to the end of the book to confirm my belief, and then gave up on it.""I'm halfway through now, and having figured out the ridiculous ending, I simply have no further interest in this book. I give it two stars because the first third held my interest and promised an interesting denouement. But once you realize who is guilty and why - and above all, how it's being done - you will probably decide, as I did, that the book just isn't worth finishing.Incidentally, does this author do any research, about anything, ever? He does not know the first thing about police procedure, criminal profiling, the FBI, or the military. Sheesh!"
3,I'm Ambivalent,"Yes, I read it in one or two sittings as I did with Child's other books. He has the talent for making me do that.But the book was annoying because it lacked any semblance of credibility. I'm not a huge FBI fan, but the way Child has it violate Reacher's rights is beyond anything it would (or could) do. And give us a break: let the guy take a shower and a nap and change his clothes while traveling without sleep from East Coast to West and back again about four times in a week.Finally, the book also contains the kind of minor mistakes that add up to strained credibility. You do not take the Palisades Parkway to the Garden state. They run parallel. And Fort Dix is not a Marine base. It's Army, unless it's changed since I served there in the '60s. There are a few others, too."
2,Not his best,This was not the strongest entry in this series. Personally I figured out who had done it and the motive by page 87. The red herrings were not believable in the context so they just screamed out that they were artificially inserted to confuse the readers.
3,I don't buy the killers method.,"Although I enjoyed the book, the killer's method revealed at the end was implausible to me. All through the book, Lee Childs gave clues and passages indicating that the victims were somewhat willing participants. I was expecting some mass suicide pact or that the killer might have some hostage or threat that would make the victims follow instructions. (I can't get around it. SPOILER WARNING!). I cannot believe anyone would ever commit suicide (with full knowledge that they would die) under hypnosis.Also, the military reverend was a cheap trick to make the reader doubt the obvious conclusion about the identity of the killer. The character played no other role in the book."
1,Disappointed,"Up until ""Running Blind"" I thought that Lee Childs' books were the best thing to happen in the genre since the death of Alistair Maclean. I read this one in a single day and was intrigued until the last 4 chapters. I kept hoping that Childs' untracable ""murder weapon"" would turn out to be something original and clever. Instead it is based on an old myth that holds no truth, no I will not give it away, but expect to be disappointed. I wish that Childs' had done a little more research since his whole premise is based on something that research has showed to be impossible. The writing and the characters are so clever and interesting that to be honest I feel cheated. I feel like I have read an Agatha Christie novel all the way through, only to be told at the end...""The butler did it."""
1,He's Reached the end...,"I enjoyed the previous Jack Reacher books - except for the author's irritating use of the word ""guy"". The plots were intricate, yet (almost) believable. Good movie material. This one, however, was stupid. OK, I'm not a citizen of the U.S.A., and in fact I have never been there. But really - the F.B.I. threatening and blackmailing Reacher? the F.B.I. shredding the Constitution in order to compel one retired MP into helping them? No. Never. Not in a thousand years. Child, it seems, has Reached the end of Reacher. The plot's flimsy, the story's unbelievable, the writing... Childish."
2,Dumb,"This one was a little less cookie-cutter than his usual, but was much sillier.AUDIO: Hill does his usual annihilation of all strong female characters.Give this one a miss."
2,Very Predictable,"Lee Child is my favorite author(hence my last name ""Reacher""), and I am sure you can read all the other reviews to see what this is about. I think the only reason I dont give this book a 1 is because Lee Child wrote it. There isn't the action represented in the first three books. Reacher takes the long way of finding out who the bad guy is when it is staring him in the face. My favorite kind of book has me guessing who the killer is throughout the whole thing. The author should make me change my mind a million times, until i finally settle on one person, who turns out to be wrong(As Child does in his previous three books). I had the bad guy pinned within the first 150 pages, and nothing after that gave me any reason to doubt my hypothesis. If you are looking for a great suspense author, you have found him, but dont waste your time with this book. I suggest his first three."
2,Somnolent,"I have read several glowing reviews of this picture, none of which makes sense now having seen the picture. Though I enjoy all the actors, outside of the children, I was unable to enjoy this tedious film. I suppose I was expecting something funny, so that is part of the problem. Peter Sellers fans should beware that he is a focal point of the movie, but most often off screen."
2,Has not aged well,"I remembered this film as a delight, which it was in the sixties, but now it comes across as forced and manipulative. The characters, who originally seemed so fresh and natural, now seem strained and phony. Sellers stands out, but only because the other actors (including the two young stars) are so bad.If you do decide to purchase this video, buy another version. This is the ""wide-screen"" (i.e., short height) version and is difficult to watch."
1,Where's the Sound?,"The sound on this DVD is terribly muffled. Had to turn the volume way up, but that only helps somewhat because it's still so unclear. Then some of the brighter tones of the music come through fullblast and you have to turn the volume down again. There's no excuse for this. The movie sounds and looks great when it airs on Turner Classic Movies, and I expected the DVD to be as good if not an improvement, but this DVD issue is a real disappointement."
4,A favorite,"I have loved this movie for about thirty years now. It captures some things about the particular kind of ardent friendship that two adolescent girls can have like no other film I've ever seen, and the scenes of New York in the sixties will fill the heart with nostalgic longing, even if you didn't grow up there yourself- I didn't. The fabulous score helps to stamp the whole thing with a poetic quality that is very memorable.I initially watched this film because I was and am a huge fan of Peter Sellers, but as others have noted, this is not primarily his movie. If you come to it looking to see a lot of Sellers, you may come away disappointed. If you want a great coming of age film with a fabulous sixties New York as it's back drop, by all means check it out."
5,Sellers is at his best,"This is a quirky comedy that might not appeal to everyone, however If you grew up in Manhattan in the 60s you'll love this movie. Sellers is at his very best, along with Paula Prentiss in a very funny supporting role."
2,Something Missing,"This movie just misses being something special... what could it be? Peter Sellers is my favorite actor but the accents he uses in this movie don't work. Perhaps the biggest obstacle to viewing pleasure is Tom Bosley's role as an absentee father - his acting is stiff and pretentious. When he says his lines, it's like he's reading them right off the script. Make-up! Mr. Bosley's smoking jacket! Take ten! The teen-age girls are adorable, Gilbert's mother and mother's friend are right on the mark, as well. But Paula Prentiss! I kept wondering why Henry Orient would keep pursuing her - with her neurotic mannerisms and skinny old self. Altogether this flick is mediocre at best."
2,Poor quality sound,"Lovely 5-star film. Had me laughing aloud many times. But (as has previously been mentioned) the sound quality on this DVD is pathetic. Very hard to hear. One needs to turn volume way up, and maybe use the subtitles too. A great pity."
4,An Enchanting Orient,"For starters, Peter Sellers does basically a glorified cameo here as the lothario pianist who is the object of affection of two smitten teenage girls(at no time in the movie does he and his tormentors appear in the same frame). That said the two girls, Merrie Spaethe and Tippy Walker, are utterly charming as the love-struck teenagers. The parents (Angela Lansbury, Tom Bosley, Phyllis Thaxter) do admirable work here as well. New York City looks great particularly in the scene where Walker walks through snow-covered Central Park on Christmas morning. A gripe about Sellers' performance: What kind of accent was he affecting. I'm assuming he was trying for New Yawk but I had a hard time imagining him playing stickball on the streets of Brooklyn as a kid."
3,Cutesy,"Like ""The Mouse That Roared"" this film is a bit thin. Sellers is good, but the story is not that interesting or funny. For me, as a huge Peter Sellers fan, I find it sort of a let down that there weren't better scripts and vehicles for Sellers to shine in at this point in his career. If you like Sellers, then maybe you pick up this movie as I did - to catch one more fleeting glimpse of his genius, but don't be surprised if you end up disappointed and frustrated."
2,3 Defective Phones from ATT and Counting,"I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, ""DOA"" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though..."
1,GARBAGE!,"A few words to the wise, Don't buy this phone!!! I got this phone as an upgrade w/ my contract renewal, and was it a mistake! This phone is straight crap! Let's just say, don't EVER, EVER EVER EVER DROP THIS PHONE!I dropped this phone One time and it straight stopped working! I couldn't believe it, so guess what, I dropped it again and figured, I dropped it and it stopped working, lets see if this works.. And Wholla! It started working again. I had an older Nokia, similar to this model. and that phone would take a lickin' and keep on tickin. This thing, is just plastic w/ some lights. How many ways can I say it... GARBAGE!"
1,Worst phone I've ever owned.,"This is the worst phone I've ever owned. After several months the paint has begun to chip off. The voice quality is fair at best. The battery life is terrible. Occasionally the mike stops working and the battery needs to be removed to reset the phone. When the phone is powered off, a number of settings (like the default messaging center) disappear and must be re-added.I will be replacing this phone soon and it won't be with another Nokia."
4,Good Phone for the $,"Had my VX8500 for about a year now, and am pretty satisfied. I bought a 2GB card for it, and use it constantly to listen to MP3s and books. It couples well with my Jabra BT8010s, and has very good sound quality for music and calls.The camera is pretty good too. With the right light, it can take some very nice pictures.The touch controls work very well on mine, and were very easy to get used to.It's even been inadvertantly dunked in a glass of diet pepsi, and still works like a charm (after it dried anyway).Battery life is great, if I don't use the MP3 player, the battery will last about 4 days on a charge (1 or 2 with heavy use).Build quality is pretty good, but I am on a refurb unit now due to the fact that the screen on my first unit blanked out on me (Verizon happily dolled out a new one though).All in all, I'm pretty happy with the VX8500."
2,Disappointing Phone w/ Short Battery Life,"I can't think of anything to gush about with this phone. Usually I like Nokia's but have been disappointed in this one.The sound dips up and down while listening to a caller.The moving display on the front screen annoys me to no end and is difficult to read. It is a large screen on the front, yet only 10% of it is utilized. The time and number of missed calls etc moves up and down the screen. Why?My only hope is that perhaps if I feel like reading the manual this can be customized.And the battery....it is CONSTANTLY beeping at me because it needs to be recharged. It is ridiculous how poor the battery life is!Basically, this is just a generic phone to me. I am struggling to find reasons that I like this phone over others. I can't think of a feature that makes it stand out above the rest."
3,Be ready to pay upto 30$ if xtra as hidden fees,"I bought this plan first bill came with an extra 30$ as all kinds of extra charges so you will end up paying 100 $ per month to verizon , rather than 69.99 shown on the amazon page. LG phone is good but speaker phone sucks. I read some reviews abt the battery life, i let the battery drain completely and recharge it compltely a couple of times, it gives me 3 days with bluetooth on. i ont talk much, but it shd give you 2days even if you talk a lot."
1,Be Prepared to Buy EXTRAS,"The phone is OK. BUT...it doesn't come with anything but a wall charger. If you want to load music onto it you have to buy a mini SD card and a data cable (sold seperatly) If you want to LISTEN to that music, you have to buy special earbuds that only fit this phone. (DUMB)I bought this phone for my 15 year old son. How many pairs of these Nokia specific earbuds am I going to have to buy?????Really a RIP OFF if you ask me....Keep looking! Don't get this one!!!!"
2,How can a phone not have an ear bud jack??,"The phone itself is pretty good, feels comfy in the hand and the bottons protrude and ""click"" so it gives nice tactile feedback, something missing from almost every phone on the markey. So you know what you're pressing at all times, almost no texting errors.However, two flaws, and one of them is MAJOR.1. How can a phone not have an input for an earbud? This is absolutely unacceptable, and I've never seen a phone in the last 6-7 years not have a simple ear bud jack, ridiculous! This is the sole reason I returned mine, as I do not care for Bluetooth, I prefer simple corded earbuds as they are cheap to replace if lost.2. Another pretty serious flaw is the battery. It is rated at 3 hours, but that is pushing it.Overall this could have been a great phone, but two pretty stupid, unthinkable mistakes like not including a basic earbud jack ruins it."
4,Great but not perfect,I have this grinder with a topside handle and SawTec shroud. It is a very good grinder. Its been in service for two years and has over 100 hours on it. 2 complaints - it is listed at 15 amps but I have tripped 30amp breakers with this unit running and no other power tools on the same circuit. Accessories and parts are difficult to locate from reputable supplies. I desperately need a replacement locking nut to hold non-threaded diamond cup wheels in place.My third complaint is specific to the SawTec shroud which is not low enough to contain the dust properly - I find myself putting duct tape around the bottom to keep the dusk inside (while attached to a dust collection system)
2,Not a book for the layperson,"I recently bought this item after reading the review for this book. I found this to be a mistake. I am an engineer by trade, and I found myself reading old school books so I could understand what this book was talking about. This book covers a wide variety of information and is difficult to read. This is not a book for the layman....."
4,Great CD - Steve Miller in top form,"This is an excellent CD and does sound like the SMB from the mid 70s. In terms of the discography and his collected works, I personally think the top 5 are: Fly Like An Eagle, The Joker, Book of Dreams, Sailor and this CD.If you enjoy Fly Like An Eagle, Book of Dreams or The Joker, you'll like this CD. What's a shame is his record company (with the exception of the 30th anniv. ""Fly"") has not remastered his major works and you can't even purchase this from Amazon."
5,An example of the best,"Star Wars, the world within our own, has been an escape and a fantasy for people around the world for 25 years. With the new prequels, a new breed of genius has taken the visual cues from Episode 1 and have developed an evolving world that leads into the dismal grey world of the original trilogy. Lead Art Director Doug Chiang, Ian McCaig, Jay Shuster, Ed Natividad, Ryan Church, Eric Tiemens and others bring together visual assault and appropriate culture cues to develop a wide array of designs and illustrations for Episode 2. If you are an artist, or are interested in the production level of film artistry, then this is a must have book. From the magnificent simplicity of the vehicle designs, to the flowing, organic genius of the character designs, this culmination of artwork is a glimpse into the world we continue to love and grow with."
5,Star Wars freaks will love this book.,great book for previz artists and star wars freaks like me.includes script with deleted scenes
4,"Good, but not that good.","Beautiful illustrations rendered in marker and wonderful costume sketches. A very interesting read, but for the amount of money i paid for it, i expected more. It could have done with some fullblown, full colour screenshots (the final effect after all the study work) and i wished more attention was paid to the panorama of the planets. Coruscant, Naoboo and Tatooine would have been lovely to see; their screenshots taken aerially and spanned over a page. I expected at least some screenshots, sadly there are none. But that aside, everything proved to be a wonderfully 'read'."
3,Star wars the Maximum!,Read the book STAR WARS attack of the clones there is a bounty hunter trying to kill the senator of naboo and there is a big fight against the sith on the planet of genosis. I will not stop liking star wars.
4,Pretty darn good,"Everything I've made from this book rocked (especially the black bean and sweet potato curry!), but I'm missing a substantial number of pages. I don't have the recipe for vegan pesto, for instance. I was rather disappointed by that fact, but the food's pretty good otherwise."
2,"Must like spices, ethnic food","My husband is a vegan who got this book as a gift. If you do not enjoy foods with strong spices, or different ethnic foods, this is not a book for you. As a non-vegan, I was expecting the vegan foods to try to closely imitate the tastes of their non-vegan equivalents. This is not the case and it left me quite disappointed."
5,A Masterpiece,"I got this book out of the library along with many others. This book was the only one that my boyfriend and I used time and time again. We're cheap students, so the library has always been our main option when it comes to books, but for the first time, we realized we would have to purchase one, and it was this book (I'm sure the library missed it for the 8 months or so we had it.) My favorite recipe in it, out of the 100 or so we've made, is the Pan-Seared Seitan with Crimini Mushrooms and Red Wine (pg 347 in the hardcover edition.) It's absolutely incredible."
5,Great book for new vegan,"The recipes in this book are delicious, easy to prepare, do not require a pantry full of exotic ingredients, and offer tastes from various ethnic cuisines, as well as, basics like ""tofu sour cream"", ""seitan"", etc. When I decided to give up (and eventually eliminate) animal products I was totally lost as to how to cook without animal products! As I entered this new world of different products, this book gradually became my ""Bible""; in it I could find tasty dishes to satisfy my meat eating husband and myself. I strongly recommend this book."
4,"So far, a keeper!","I've only made a few recipes from this book so far: Bowties with Buttons (i eliminated the kasha as my family is picky, but it still made an interesting side dish!), the Chocolate Chip Cookies--very good and didn't require any esoteric ingredients!, and the Lasagna Primavera, which was admittedly a bit time consuming but well worth it as both my husband and 4 year old enjoyed it. I think i'll be making quite a few recipes out of this book, if only to expose my family to more ethnic flavors and dishes. I gave the book four stars just because i have had to tweak seasonings--the vegan bechamel sauce was a bit bland without some garlic and salt, and the tofu filling for the lasagna called for parsley which is fine but not very flavorful for an Italian dish. I would rather she had exact measurement for salt and pepper instead of ""to taste""."
4,Time consuming...,"I live in a fairly small city, so we only have the basic big brand grocery stores here. Some of the things in these recipes are expensive and difficult to find. Also, the recipes are pretty time consuming. The food is deliscious though, so if you don't spending a little (time and money), you'll probably be quite pleased with the meals."
3,"Great food, time intensive to make","The recipes in this book are great, I think it gets more creative than a lot of vegan recipes I've seen and they usually turn out great if followed closely. That being said, I find that this cookbook suffers from the same issue I find with a lot of vegan recipes, which is that often the recipes call for a lot of ingredients. Often the recipes will have ingredients such as a vegetarian worchestire sauce that you need to turn around and make. In other words, I find these recipes time intensive. I think another good measure of how time intensive some of these recipes are is the number of ingredients required to make them, which is often around 15. When I have the time and feel like cooking, I bring out this book. But most days when I'm looking to make something fast I don't have the time."
4,Makes Being Vegan Easy and a Joy,"Truly a must have for anyone enjoying a vegan diet. So many exquisite recipees with unique flavors, textures and visual appeal. When I first told my husband I wanted us to go vegan, he said no way. But I bought the book anyway and have been cooking out of it for three weeks almost every night straight and my husband has been delighted with every meal and has not complained once and doesn't even know he's eating vegan! These are unusual meals that are not too hard to prepare if you have a well stocked kitchen, you need the right tools for the job and you need to be willing to shop frequently as a vegan for the fresh foods these recipees require, but the results are well worth your effforts guaranteed. As an experienced cooking enthusiast, I highly recommend!"
2,Quantity not Quality,"Everything I made was mediocre at best and there are so many other vegan cookbooks out there that I got rid of this one after it sat unused for years so that I could make room for better vegan cookbooks. Don't waste your money, get Vegan with a Vengeance and Veganomicon and start from there."
1,"Bland, with Errors","I found this book largely disappointing. The savory dishes I tried were uniformly bland. I made it a practice to double the spices, and still found them bland. I tried one dessert, a fruit cobbler, which contained an unfortunate typo. (do not put 2/3 cup sugar in the fruit, they are supposed to get only 2 tbsp) This cost me a large amount of fairly expensive fruit, plus an extra helping of frustration.Those looking for a comprehensive vegan cookbook would do better with ""Veganomicon."" I also like ""Vegan with a Vengeance."""
3,Mediocre cookbook.,"Like other reviewers have stated, this cookbook is severely lacking in the photography and nutritional information departments. On top of that, the general book design looks a bit tacky and thrown-together; I would describe it as unprofessional.Very few of the recipes grabbed my eye and the dozen or so I tried were extremely mediocre. I got this book as a gift years ago and haven't opened it much...and when I do, I heavily modify the recipes. Save your money and either buy used or check it out at the library - for inspiration only."
3,Just so-so,"This was my first vegan cookbook. It's functional and has some pretty good recipes (my favorites are the smoothies and breakfast foods), but overall I'm disappointed. Some recipes that sound fabulous, like the Cool Cucumber Soup with Cilantro and Lime, turn out unpalatable no matter how many times I try them. And many of the recipes I've tried have come out bland and, consequently, not very tasty. That said, it is a huge cookbook and there are still many recipes I have not tried (the problem is that I'm not inspired to try them!). If you're looking for a great vegan cookbook, I suggest Vegan with a Vengeance."
5,Just starting out??? Get this book,I first got this Book from the library since you can never tell with some cookbooks whether the recipes are going to work or not or if they are just yucky. Well after the first few recipes I bought the book. The recipes WORK and are delicious. There are not crazy hard to find ingredients which with some vegan cookbooks seem to be the norm. Who wants to spend eons looking for some weird food item. If you are starting into the Vegan world get this cookbook it will introduce you into a world of delicious easy cooking. I just can say enough great things about this book. A great addition to your recipe book shelf.
5,Great cookbook even for non-vegetarians!,"I am not vegetarian, let alone vegan, but I wanted a change from the meat-cheese-cream-laden dishes in the Midwest part of the US and in many cookbooks. Vegan Planet has provided an amazing array of easy-to-prepare and flavorful dishes ranging from traditional ""meat and potato"" kinds of vegetarian dishes to those with more adventurous palates. Each and every recipe has been easy to make and tastes WONDERFUL! If more people knew how to cook vegan food as Robin offers in her recipes here, there would likely be a lot more vegetarians!"
5,The only cookbook you will ever need.,"I have experienced several vegan cookbooks in my lifetime. This is definitely one of the better ones. I was looking for vegetable recipes, but came away with so much more.Seriously, You will never even have to think of using animal products again with this cookbook. Ms. Robertson takes a vegan approach to classic recipes like New England chowder and Italian wedding soup.There is also a huge variety of recipes from different countries and cultures, all meat/dairy free. I cannot wait to try the scallion pancakes with sesame seeds.Vegan Planet is wonderful!"
4,Good educational toy!,"I got this toy for my 3 year old daughter for Xmas. She is interested in using mommy's calculator and I loved how this one talked. The voice is nice and clear. It gives you a choice to say the numbers as units and digits (25=two,five or twenty-five). It also has an answer only option (it only speaks the answer). The only fault I have with it is it misreads numbers by inserting ""and"" incorrectly (859=eight hundred and fifty-nine). Only the decimal point should be read as ""and"". I know that sounds nerdy but I'm a teacher so I can't help it! Overall pretty good toy. I couldn't find a better one and I looked hard!"
2,Disappointing durability,"Worked pretty well, was okay for battery usage (I used rechargeables). Cutting was okay, but died after about 6 months of low to moderate usage."
2,Wahl 41559- Nasal trimmer,"My Wahl trimmer produced adequate, functional removal of hair. Inexplicably, the trimmer simply stopped working after eight months. I am undecided if I would purchase another Wahl trimmer."
5,You can't always get what you want...,"I've tried several trimmers over the years, they all were crap in one way or another. This one works about the best out of all I tried."
2,Good for as long as it lasts,"I was very happy with this product when I first got it about 16 months ago. It trimmed the nose hairs as well as trimmed up my ear hair very well. I made sure I maintained it well, cleaning it regularly etc. But after one year it sounded like it was working at full speed but it started to trim only about half of the hairs. Then it started to only work sporadically. I would change the battery to no avail and then suddenly it would start up again. But now it makes a very lazy wirring sound when it runs and barely trims anything. I give this item 5 stars for the year it worked and understand that all products do often have a certain life span. But whatever the cost of this item 1 year is just not acceptable. So for as a lasting, working product it gets barely 2 stars. I will buy another brand and caution other buyers to do the same."
1,Completely unfunctional,"I bought this model a year ago and have never had it effectively cut nose hair. It's as if there are no blades! It's completely ineffective and a waste of money. I've tried it continually over the past year and repeatedly end up going back to my old Panasonic model, which works much better. At long last, the Wahl goes in the trash."
2,Wahl 41559-517 Deluxe Water Proof Personal Trimmer,I have used this trimmer for over a year and am not satisfied with its performance. The switch is inconsistent in turning on and off. The cutting speed is slow and ineffective. I have owned an older Wahl trimmer and it is fast and works well. I would not recommend this trimmer.
3,"""Good"" while it lasted...",At first I was quite satisfied with the product. It fit my needs perfectly for just about a year at which time it started to become sluggish.This sluggishness persisted even with numerous battery changes. I got a solid year's use from the trimmer. The problem seems to be its' limited mechanical lifespan.
4,Who edited this book?,A great beginner book on Buddhism and for fans of Star Wars like myself. My only gripe about this book was the extreme number of typos and one trivia error.
5,Wonderful book on Buddhism,"This book was so easy to read, and was entertaining with the way Star Wars characters and scenes were used as examples. The Buddhist concepts explained were the clearest and most easy to understand yet, even on the topic of emptiness.I highly recommend this book if you want to learn about Buddhism, whether you're interested in Star Wars or not. For those who do love Star Wars, you'll really enjoy the Jedi Order compared in Buddhist terms.Just a great book all the way around. A few typos, but a very good read."
4,"The ""Force"" for Dummies","I purchased this book as a gift for my mother, a chaplain of many years, with twice that many devoted to the study of world religions. I am a Star Wars fan first and foremost, but this book touchs on so many levels that I felt compelled to get it for her. This book gets to the micro-makeup of our favorite Star Wars characters, why Darth Vader was following his path, why Obi-wan was found wanting. A true joy to read and an important book to those that want to learn why Star Wars is seen as the ""myth"" of the 21st Century."
4,Good for a book with no editor...,"Good book to learn about dharma and see examples of it in Star Wars, but seriously in need of a spellcheck."
1,this show has gone down hill!,This use to be a good show but now it has turned into some real housewives crap. they need to get new writers or at least get the writers of the first 3 seasons back!!!!!
5,The best season,"The best season to me. There was only 12 episodes, but that allowed them to move the story lines at a faster pace."
4,Good show,I had already seen the other seasons so I wanted 2 make sure I kept up. This was a good buy and it came in one week.
3,Not the Vasks I hoped for,"Over the past year, I have become a huge fan of Baltic choral music (Vasks, Esenvalds, Miskinis, Bryars, Praulins)and in my pursuit to find music that provided the same ethereal beauty and expression, I purchased this highly recommended CD of Vasks orchestral faire. Alas, the Baltic choral magic is not to be found here, at least not for me. The music is OK, periodically even lovely and expressive; but in my view, the peace and beauty is too often dashed by the 'shouting' and ugliness of a common, mid-20th century sound that just won't go away - like an angry Shostakovich without the clever tunes.This material may please those who appreciate mid-20th century orchestral racket, but this is not the remarkably beautiful and expressive music that Vasks gives us in his many choral compositions. 'Pater Noster' and 'Plainscapes' are both superb and meaningful offerings. This release just doesn't work for me."
1,Would not play!!!,"This DVD would not play in my blu ray or in my Wii. In the blu ray the main menu loaded but I could not get it to play, in the Wii nothing would load at all, it said there was an error with the disc."
2,Wasn't What I Expected,"It was insightful, but not what I was hoping for. It did not go into detail of how to draw characters, so if you are a beginner, buy a different book that specifically addresses the issue of how to draw the people. This was more trying to get you started drawing a whole manga book-- backgrounds, comic boxes, and equipment."
2,"No, no, no...","This book spends far more time telling us what kind of materials are needed and where to buy them/how to use them, than it does ""how"" to draw manga. I want to learn what characteristics make a successful manga figure, not how to produce a manga comic book. I did not feel this book was very useful - there is only one useful page, for example, discussing eyes, and it simply has 4 sets of ""boys' eyes"" and 4 of ""girls' eyes.""I don't consider this a ""how to draw"" book but rather a ""how to get started making manga books with all the appropriate materials."" Give me a black marker and some colored pencils and I'm happy. This book isn't worth it."
4,Manga Magic,"All of you out there who would like to draw manga, and have a small to superb experience range, read this book! I bought it from a bookstore (Barnes&Noble), and found it extremely useful. I, although, was a beginner, back then, and found it difficult to comprehend what they said (a bit confusing). But, if you have that little bit of Manga Knowledge, pick it up!"
3,Make Sure It Fits,"This looks like a nice product, but I bought this to install a Kenwood KDC248U In-Dash Car Stereo in my 2004 GMC Sierra, and it was not even close to the correct piece. I have found it very difficult to find any information to determine the correct adapter for my truck. Do your homework, and do not rely on the product description to determine if this will work for you."
1,Didn't fit my car like it listed!,"It listed my car as one that it will fit, but it did not and I ended up going to a local auto store and purchased one that actually worked."
3,didn't fit,Great wiring harness but didn't fit the car had to go buy one the fit. thanks you anyway we tried.
1,did not match my car even when it said it would,did not match my car even when it said it would. After i tried it I could not send it back
1,Did not fit my 92 toyota camry,"Yes, I know the fit guide says it does not fit, but i know the fit guide isn't always right, and I could have sworn i read a review that said it would fit a 92 camry. Welp, yes, sorely disappointed, had to go to walmart."
2,Does not fit!,"Nicely constructed but does not fit my 2002 Oldsmobile Silhouette. The description ""For GM 87-05"" is too vague."
1,It doesn't fit.,"Althought it said it fit and the amazon garage feature said it would fit it doesn't. It was for my girls 02 alero. I looks like it needs a 60 buck adaptor. I bought the radio because amazon said it would work. Not I have to spend 60 install a 40 dollar radio or return the radio and givemy girl the 40 bucks i spent on the radio for christmas. Thanks a lot Metra and Amazon. You ruined Christmas. J/K I am done with buying ""deal"" on amazon. Walmart is better."
2,Neutral rating.,"I couldn't honestly say how good this is, because it turned out that the stereo unit I bought it for already had a wiring harness with it, so I did not need this one. Oh, and by the way, this harness didn't seem to fit my unit anyway. I only kept it because it was inexpensive and maybe one day it'll come in handy somehow."
1,Wouldn't Recomend to Anyone,"Bought it for my 2003 Pontiac Sunfire. Hooked all the necessary wires up, disassembled the dash and popped out the radio, only to find that the harness DID NOT EVEN CLOSELY RESEMBLE the factory harness. If one is looking for sheer disappointment, have at it. Buy it in bulk then. Heck, go ahead and tell your kid Santa isn't real while your at it. Whatever tickles the ole pickle."
2,Not for Pontiac Vibe,"This was indicated as the correct harness for my 2003 Pontiac Vibe, but is not. Find one that is the correct shape. (Also, per the reviews on that product page, the Metra harness sold specifically for the 2003 Vibe has a wiring problem--I suggest a different product.)"
1,wrong description,The product did not fit the range of vehicles the description said it would. Not worth shipping back to supplier.All total another $15 thrown away.
1,Wrong one,Part looked good but didn't fit.I even did the amazon fit checker. Kinda bummed but Im beginning to expect this from amazon. Oh well ill order the right one and be on my way.
3,???,Does anyone know if this would fit a 2002 cadillac deville? I dont want to buy it and it not work out for me.
5,Perfect fit 97 Chevy Pick Up,This fit the plug and matched the colors perfectly on my new deck to the truck. The only difference was one extra set of wires that I didn't need. Enexpensive and hassle free.
4,fits perfect 2001 chevy suburban,"This wire fit on 2001 Chevy suburban and you have to connect this metra to after market stereo's wires it takes some time and effort if you don't have the correct equipments i have done mine with electric tape.Works really good all the wires are named and it has enough information .I rated 4 star because they would do this wires other end to fit after market stereos , lots of the after market stereos have the similar or same wiring."
1,Did not fit 2005 Silverado,"Soldered all the connections from the head unit to this harness. Pulled out the factory unit, the connectors are different. i had to get the Metra 70-2003 Radio Wiring Harness For GM 98-Up Harness. The Metra 70-2003 Radio Wiring Harness For GM 98-Up comes with a red wire that needs to be connected the to fuse box and the red wire of the head unit. I guess the red wire on the Metra 70-2003 goes to nothing on the factor 2005 harness, no 12v, like the others have said. Connecting the red 12v wire to the fuse box is advanced. I'm not doing it. Taking it to Best Buy for $160."
4,worked fine,its a wiring harness not sure what to say it fit together well and the colors on the wires were pretty? there it worked great on my 94 silverado.
4,whoops...careful GM buyers.....check your pins.,"I bought this connector because it says it will work with any GM installation from 1988 to 2005. What it doesn't say is there are many pin configurations available in various GM audio systems. I needed a 33 pin connector, but I ordered a 25 pin. It pays to look behind your current deck or at the audio system specs if you have them. Not a bad product, I did buy the 33 pin and it worked perfectly, same brand!"
1,Wrong Harness For My HHR,AMAZON recommended me get this harnest for my HHR and it does not fit. I never contacted them because I just got a new stero last week and i ordered this a few months ago. Not sure if they will even refund my money.
5,Worked great,"I bought this product after watching an "" how to video"" on installing my stereo on YouTube. This product made the job easy and quick. All the wires are color coded the same as my pioneer stereo."
1,was not the right one,"shipped very quick , came before expected. we were disappointed that it was the wrong one. but all the numbers were right."
1,Did not fit!,This cable was supposed to mate with the harness in the dash of my 1991 Chevy S-10 and it wasn't even close.
1,Doesn't fit / wrong harness.,"If you have onstar, this is not the harness that you need. The one you need is between $90 and $180, depending on where you go. Best Buy will knock you back $200."
2,Wrong harness.,I needed a harness for an '06. This harness works for '05 and older. Too much trouble to return...I just tossed it and used splicers to match my factory wiring. And a Haynes manual to get the colors right...
1,Verify it works with your vehicle,The part says 88-05 GM does not work with 04 cavalier. Had to throw part away not even close fit at all.
4,Come home Mom!,"Here's a book that supports what we all know deep down: Moms are the best people to raise their children. Anything anyone can do to make it easier for Moms to be healthy at home would be welcome. The stonger the family, the stronger the nation. Conversely, the weaker the family, the weaker the nation. More than ever, with the barrage of media and other dangers, our homes need smart, savvy and confident Moms. Moms who follow their hearts, and spiritual promptings. Moms have more potential to influence their children than anyone else.They are absolutely key to family stability. That is why the adversary tries so hard to undermine motherhood and the family. He is all too aware of the unfathomable power that they hold for good. Take note Dads! Help your wives to come home and tell them every day how fabulous they are (the world is not telling them this)."
2,Only one for good hikes,"I have read the book and found it quite intresting...but...the reviews that it gives sound to good of what the hike really is.Since it is really the only book out there for the somewhat good hikes in Israel,it might be an only choice.My advice is to ask around for the good hikes and updates on the hikes listed in the book(which some are not practical,since they gave back some of the hiking areas)...ask a native they know the best"
5,nifty companion,During passover 2001 we used this guide book which thorougly enriched the meaningfulness of the hikes and sites we visited.We especially found that the botanical aspects really enhanced our understanding of the rich flora in Israel.
5,Overcoming the Black Magic of gender education by bright wizardry,"I saw this movie in the original German version, when my daughter Rosa was 8. Proudly she explained the plot to me, making sure she already was ""knowing"". > By accidental wizardry a boy and a girl change their bodies, but not their mind. The girls mother desperstedly wants her daughter to be trained for swimming championship while the boy comes from an artist's family, where his dreaming and fantasy are encoureged. They both find out, that they have only few hours left to change back to their original bodies (and life!)They manage to coordinate their personal abilities, overcome their prejudices and find the old hobo-wizard in charge for the key to turn the spell back. A fantastic comedy not to be recommended for rednecks and bible-belters because of its freshness.The movie is made with lots of love, respect on sense of humour. Reinhard Liebe, family-therapist, Vienna"
3,backpack,My daughter love her pack. No water bottle cage and too small inside to carry one with books. This is our third pack from Jansport. We still have the other two which has been serviced by Jansport as the packs have worn. Totally worth the money!
3,Coloring not as advertised,"I bought the zebra print backpack like another reviewer and was also disappointed that the purple coloring wasnt in places shown in the picture. The purple accents along the straps were one of the main reasons I wanted it....too bad, but still a cool backpack."
2,Too small,"I bought this backpack for my son for his freshman year of high school. He came to me two days later and told me he had too many things from his classes and they wouldn't all fit in this pack. Together we tried to make room for everything and were able to squeeze it all in. However, the backpack started coming apart at the seams a week later."
4,A nice backpack,"I ordered this backpack as a temporary solution. I thought it was cheap ($20 item, around $10 shipping), but now I realize it isn't.Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product: Too simple, only one big and one small compartments, with the small one being the front pocket. In addition, The straps are small. I am big, but I see many larger people than me around and to be honest if you are aroun XL or XXL size it would be quite uneasy to put the backpack over a jacket as its straps are simply too short.The good part: it looks durable, does the business, and now I will keep it as a spare since I now have another one(Not JanSport:) but sill, the price somehow appears to be alittle too much for me. For the same amount I gave I could find a real nice Adidas or Nike (original ones:) back in my country."
2,Poor quality,"I bought 3 of these to replace worn out back packs. I thought they would be great quality, but from the appearance they look no better than the ones they already had that fell apart after 3 months. I was really disappointed by how thin they are."
5,GREAT BAG,I RECEIVED MY BAG WITHIN A WEEK AND HALF AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING IN AFGHAISTAN. IT ISN'T TOO BIG OR SMALL AND STURDY ENOUGH TO LAST OUT HERE. GOOD BAG FOR THE PRICE.
5,I love it,"i love it , im very happy , the backpack is for my daugther and she is very happy, i like very much the color"
5,I love it,The price is suitable. And it looks like pretty. It is big enough for me to carry my books in whole day.
2,Really small.,"I really like the color and it is aesthetically pleasing in my opinion. I'm not sure if they sent me the wrong size or something but it is really small. It looks like a first graders back pack, not one for a college student."
5,Love it.,I've been using this backpack since my 2nd semester of college and it has been holding up very well. I just wish it had more padding though.
5,durable,This lives up to Jansports reputation. Excellent quality. Perfect size.Shipping was super fast. My son is still using it.
4,Great Backpack,"This bag is a nice, simple bag with few pockets. Not useful for carrying a laptop, but it is a reliable brand."
2,why do people like this so much?,It is really low quality and the straps are uncomfortable.I bought it for my daughter If I had seen it before I would not buy it. I think it is not good for a child. Because comfort is more important for them than adults.I will not return it but will not use for school.I am very disappointed.It is like a joke!!!
2,EXPENSIVE!!!!,"For the quality and size of this backpack, it is way overpriced. I can buy a large size gym bag for the price of this backpack."
5,cheap and good,works as advertized. the only drawback is its lack of pockets. its got just the one pocket with an inner pocket. not a big deal to me but for some it might be a problem. its simplicity is a strength and also a weakness i guess.
4,geat brand for a great price--,"This is a nice looking, sturdy back pack for most elementary school children. The only drawback is, it's a bit small.I bought it for my middle school son. He loved it, but could not fit all of his books and school supplies in it. My fourth-grader, who is notorious for tearing up back-packs, uses it every day. It's a perfect fit for him. It is holding up quite well!"
5,backpack,"i hadnt used a backpack since middle school, but my large shoulder purse/bag was hurting my shoulder so i finally convinced myself to get a backpack. jansport is awesome, it got here in time and my 15.6 laptop fits in it, their warranty is a major reason why i also decided to go with them. plus its a great color"
5,Daughter loves it,seems to be holding up really well- had it for about 3 months. The colors are great and it's unique.
5,"High Quality, my daughter loves it....","Although I had offered her several other brands of backpacks similar in price, my daughter was insistent that we purchase a Jansport bag. I now see why....This bag is just right for carrying several of her textbooks back and forth to school. The straps rest comofortably on her shoulders without being bulky. The fabric and the constructions appears to be well thought-through and well-made, ready to endure the abuse that my daughter will certainly wreck up her new backpack. She tells me that she expects this bag to last through the last two years of high school on into college. I believe, after actually seeing the pack in person, she may be right! :)"
4,Great Quality Backpack,"Jansport has always been a favorite of mine. In fact, I don't think I have ever purchased any other brand backpack! I couldn't quite afford the suede bottom style this time, so I ordered this one, and it is just as good. Of course, I got it in my favorite color. The Electric Purple is even more vibrant in person. It's a gorgeous color. This is the best deal that I found on the internet."
4,Bad Delivery,This item was listed as being instock. I chose this item over others because I needed it within a week (according to the listing that was possible. After I paid for the item I received an email stating it was out of stock and would be delaied for one week. Beware is all I can say.
5,Durable backpack,"You can't go wrong with JanSport. Don't know why but their backpacks last a really long time while the other brands rip and break. My son loves anything camo and this one fit the bill. He loves it and it is very durable. Thrilled that I could get it mid-school year because his old backpack died. Plus it's original, no one else at school has it! Highly recommended."
3,Picture problem...,"The picture used for this product does not protray what I received. The color is lighter and the straps are not gray. The whole bookbag is the same color. I really liked the gray/pink color scheme. But other than that it works great, Jansport has amazing quality bookbags!"
1,POOR QUALITY -- wouldn't last one week in school!,"I purchased this product for my 1st grader. He liked the design; I liked the Jansport brand (I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy). Well, the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material. The backpack was so lightweight that my son's water bottle could put a hole through its side. The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results. In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home. I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off, and he reassured me that it was a genuine product. Although I couldn't believe him completely, the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack."
2,too different in color,"The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly. And I have tried to return this item, but I failed because UPS did come to pick the package in three days. And I am leaving in two weeks so I am afraid I cannot get the refund at that time so I gave up to return this item. This is an awful experience!"
1,This looks nothing like it does in the picture . Very misleading,I got excited when i came across this bag because of the colour and when i received it i was very disappionted the colour is nothing like the one in the picture and i am so not happy with this bag .
5,Great Simple Backpack,"Back pack has all the space I need and nothing more to make it bulky. Great for me to be carrying around college, perfect size, tons of color options, and you can adjust the size to whatever you want. Cool backpack!"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This is a Jansport so of course quality and durability aren't even a problem. This is the cutest Jansport bag I've ever had (and I've had QUITE a few). What you see is exactly what you get. Cute purple and white argyle pattern, the back of the pack is a solid purple (maybe more of a plum color). The zippers are silver metal with purple flaps connected for easy zipper use. Straps adjust very well so the pack can fit very snug or very loose depending on how you'd like it. The small outside pocket has a built in open pocket inside for various items and also has two small slots made for pens or pencils. Overall great buy and of course the lifetime warranty is included with the Jansport bag. Great for college students. I used this same line of Jansport packs (in a different pattern) for the first 3 years of college with no problems."
1,wrong product display,"I saw this bag well displayed with multi-divisions(sections) and got attracked to it because that was what I wanted but to my surprise, is far from what it was displayed. I am very much disappointed,it will not serve my purpose and I hate it that I do not even know what to do with it. it was totally wrong product display."
2,Wrong and unacceptable color of Jansport,"The shipping time is ok, but the color is totally wronge. It is impossible to carry the kind of color to outside."
5,Jansport Backpack,My son selected this bag though I wanted him to take other model. He loved it sooo much. It is light one and very comfortable for his back. All his friends liked it .
3,Didn't get what I ordered,"I ordered this backpack for my 13yo daughter, and we didn't get the color we ordered. My daughter insisted it was okay and she likes what we got. She really isn't a ""pink"" kind of girl, so we ordered the chocolate colored one...but we got a pink one. I hate having to deal with returning things, but I certainly would have returned it if my daughter hadn't insisted it was really okay. She's happy with the quality of the backpack."
3,Too big for younger children,"This is a standard size backpack, not kid-sized. They should make that clearer. Their service at least, in crediting my account upon receiving my return, was very good."
1,flimsy,I couldn't believe it was a jansport. It is the sorriest excuse for a backpack I have seen in awhile. More like something from the K-mart bargain basement. Would definitely not suggest buying it.
4,Basic back pack elegant color,"Basic back pack elegant color I really enjoy having this back pack to take my groceries and this was the purpose, so it's perfect. The plus is that this gray color is pretty elegant and I can go other places before food shopping and it doesn't affect my looks. I think the price is great as well, smart choice!"
2,jansport backpack,"Very disappointed in this backpack. My daughter was happy with it, but myself as a mother knows that it will last no longer than a couple of months. There is absolutely no lining within the back. Fits all her books though she says....."
5,great school bag,"We have to source them from the US, but they are a great schoolbag. Light and strong. Great fabric.Highly recommended."
3,Doesn't fit that much,"My daughter entered 5th grade this year. Between the extra homework, her flute, and her gym clothes, we knew we were going to need a bigger backpack than she already had. She loved the color of this one and the dimensions seemed like it was a good size, so we got it. After a few months of use, we both agreed that we should have gotten something bigger."
2,too small,This was supposed to be large enough for an adult. It's really meant for a Jr. High school student. A waste!
4,muy buen producto,"muy buen producto los recomiendo, fue enviado en el tiempo ofrecido y muy bien empacado, el producto es bueno muchas gracias"
5,light and durable,"This backpack was soo worth the price. Although the material is quite thin, it makes it really light and comfortable even when you're carrying around tons of things in it. the front pocket has lots of compartments and storage room and although this backpack looks small, it has LOTS of space. i'd get this again if i needed. great backpack! u won't go wrong buying this"
3,JanSport Super Break backpack,"This is a nice backpack, smaller than I thought it would be. The lip over the zipper is a pain because it gets caught in the zipper. Other than that it's great. I love jansport products."
4,High School Backpack,"I especially love the color of this backpack, it is very cute, however since this backpack only has two pockets it does not have a lot of space for textbooks. Other than the space issue it is a very nice backpack."
5,Great Backpack,I was looking for a backpack for my fiance to have for her classes. And this pack is great for her because its small and yet can hold all her books for class.
3,Typical Backpack,"This is just a typical backpack. I'm military and we're only allowed to wear certain colors (i.e. black). I thought the lavel that says ""Jansport"" was black but it's actually blue. I wasn't happy about that but oh well."
5,Great backpack,"Out of all the backpacks we have purchased throughout my son's school career thus far this backpack is their favorite. It is light weight, made well and simple. My sons have said they don't like all the pockets other backpacks have..they can never find their stuff. This has one large zipper pocket for books, etc. and one smaller zipper pocket right in the front for pencils, etc. Will purchase this again."
5,The last bookbag you'll ever need to purchase,"My black JanSport Superbreak Classic Backpack rocks! It is very well made and constructed. The material feels great and sturdy. It holds all of my heavy college books and then some!There is a pocket inside the smaller compartment that is great for holding my wallet when I don' feel like having it in my pocket. The bag is not too big. Its simple and just right, not bulky.The top loop is great for hanging it on the hook that's on the door of the restroom stall when you don't want to place it on the floor.This thing looks great in black. I was afraid that the blue background of the JanSport logo (that is on the black bags) was going to be too bright, but thankfully it is darker than it is in the photo. It is a dark navy color.This bag comes with a lifetime warranty that I doubt I will ever need. I'm sure that this is the last backpack I'll ever need to get! :)"
2,Zebra print backpack,"The backpack shown in the picture is not the same as the one delivered. My daughter was quite disappointed. The one delivered is a cute backpack, but not what I thought I was ordering. The one pictured has bright purple; the one delivered has very dark purple that isn't noticible. The one pictured has purple straps at the top and on the bottom of the shoulder straps. The one delivered has all black... So, the only things purple on the one we got are the zipper pulls. By the time we got it we were afraid if we sent it back, my daughter would not have a new one by the first day of school. So, we added our own purple to it. I'll think twice about ordering from here again."
4,Good but could be better,"As soon as I got this product I must admit I was a bit scared. The bag seemed so small and I was worried I would have to return it. But thankfully once I got some books and folders in there I realized it was the perfect size. Easily carried two large textbooks and a binder with room to spare. Though, it int without its flaws.One thing I don't like about it is how plastic-ey it feels. Feels kind of cheap, but I think it will hold up nicely.It also collects dust fairly easily when laid on a floor. Its easily wiped away though.My last complaint is that the straps are very cheap and thin and need to be worked in.Other than that its a great bag. Suites my needs nicely."
5,...,I have had this bag for a while now and I must say it looks exactly the same as when I bought it. This is a bag that was made to last. But anyways I would recommend this as more of a casual bag than a school bag. So overall a great product.
5,Great backpack! Really fits nice on ma back!,"Great backpack! Really fits nice on ma back! Its a classic American bag with extra frills, I like that, and you will too."
2,Rip,"My kids have used JanSport backpacks in the past and we haven't had a problem with them. However, I ordered this one in the beginning of September. My daughter has used it for about 2 weeks and it has already ripped. I am very disappointed in JanSport."
4,Backpack,Was exactly what Grand son asked for. He does art work on white back pack. We received item very punctually.
4,Daughter likes the looks but it's a very lightweight backpack,"I'd almost go so far as to call it flimsy - the material is quite thin.Aside from general impressions of not being particularly sturdy, the bag is pretty well constructed and my 7th grade daughter loves the way it looks (she got the blue streak tone deaf model)."
5,Jansport never fails!,All my backpacks I've had since 2nd grade have been a Jansport backpack. I've never had any problems with any of my backpacks. When you first get the backpack the straps are a little stiff but they quickly form to your body. The backpacks are cute and durable. With all of the different kinds of backpacks it's great.
4,Thin material,"I bought a Jansport bookbag for my 6 year old daughter. While the size was perfect for her, the material is a lot thinner than the canvas Jansport bookbag I have from 10 years ago that I used. But is does have a lifetime warrantee so we will see how it holds up."
3,Jansport backpack review,Backpack is simple and functional. Got this for my little brother for grade school. He likes it because of the design and small form factor.
4,Black Jansport Backpack,This backpack is very sturdy and great for my son who is in high school. It was not as roomy as I thought and he would of liked more compartments.
1,"Low Quality, NOT made in America anymore, and obvious + Bogus Warranty","I bought this backpack for college and after 9 months it tore in three places. Terrible quality. I paid 5 Bucks to mail it in for repair under warranty and after two months with no responce I called and found out that they won't fix anything because the damage happened, ""as a result of normal use,"".....well isn't that exactly why companies have a warranty? So that if the product you buy from them shows manufacturing defects that become evident through normal use the product is replaced? This company is a joke and only profits on the fact that they have huge name recognition, but this product was of very low quality and the warranty is a fraud."
1,Not pink at all,"I purchased this, thinking that it was hot pink, but to my surprise the backpack was a unexpected salmon color ""pink."" Don't be fooled by the description (Pink Prep)."
4,A bit late,I ordered this backpack on the 15 and it said it was going to come on the 25 but it didn't so im still waiting. Hopefully I'll get it on monday
5,perfect!!,Justm what my son wanted and I didn't have to go anywhere with him except amazon!!Thanks so much more than I can say!!!
3,OK backpack for a child,"This backpack is beautiful. It is also bare bones. It is quite thin, and I don't know how long it will hold up to a 10 year old's abuse. I could have bought equal quality at the drug store for half the price. I own another Jansport style that I bought 4 months ago and it is awesome: sturdy, stylish, roomy, and lots of great compartments. This one has only one compartment, and a zippered one in the front. That's it. My daughter loves it so I will let her keep it. Hopefully it will last the new school year."
5,Item is just as described,"The yellow in actuality is a little too bright for my taste and it runs a little big for my body but well, I'm small (4'10"") so what do I expect. The item came quickly and it was exactly as described. It stands out a lot so if you don't mind catching peoples' attentions and being associated with a yellow backpack, then go for it1"
3,wrong backpack,"I recevied the wrong backpack, I ordered a white with all purple dots but recevied white with purple and green dots. I kepted it because it was ok and didn't feel like waiting for another one. Overall shipping and arriving time was ok just recevied the wrong order."
4,"Excellent Light Bag, but thin fabric","I love this bag because it is light and roomy. However after laying it on the concrete a few times, it has 2 small holes at the bottom because the bag is so thin. I got my money's worth, but will look for something with a leather bottom if you lay your bag on the ground at all."
5,Popular Backpack,I purchased this backpack for my 6th grade daughter. Many of the girls in her class are also toting this pack in the various designs available. As a parent it's great to have purchased something at a resonable price that is highly in fashion and is of excellent quality. This is the first year she has not requested a new backpack within the first month of school.
2,"Yes, it carries things.","This isn't really worth the price. Based on strength and utility alone, I've seen cheaper backpacks at Wal-Mart, etc. that far outshine this little thing. This is really quite small, don't let the big numbers fool you.I guess I could suggest this for elementary schoolers, but as a college student this really doesn't work for me. I remember carrying even more books in high school, so yeah, that's out too. When you get this, you're really just paying for the name brand. They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality.1. Smaller than it looks.2. Very thin fabric.3. The joke they call 'padding' doesn't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back.4. The straps feel very weak, and I don't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it.5. The backpack has a tendency to 'slide' down; the buckle doesn't hold the straps well, so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will."
5,perfect!,bought this and it's a perfect sized backpack for a student! not the mini but a full size jansport! You could easily fit 2 textbooks and some notepads in it!
2,Bag is here as it is but the fabric is cut from the top.,I received my bag and it looks exactly like i wanted it. Problem is it's cut like someone has used a knife or razor to cut it a whole 5cm cut on the top of the bag. This is not what i really imagined to get.
3,The colors don't match,"I received a bag with red birds instead of pink ones.But the bag is ok and it is made of impermeable material, not cloth."
4,Cute Jansport backpack,This is a super cute backpack. Not exactly for heavy school books but quite enough for in-between period loads. A great buy for the price.
4,Ali backpack,My daughter had been searching for the right backpack in our local stores and was unable to find one in-stock when she found one she liked. I decided to check Amazon and low and behold I was able to get her the one she originally wanted at a much better price.
3,Was nice til it broke,"I am from WI, near the Jansport factory, so I am familiar with the brand. Not as sturdy as I remember, the fabric was thin, but cool looking. After using it as a gym bag for a month, the zipper broke. Now it is un-usable, so it was nice while it lasted."
5,Great buy,This is a great book bag. It is smaller than I thought it would be. The color is so pretty though.
5,awesome bag,this bag is very useful and it has a lot of space which is a good thing and i love using it!
5,I love it!,"It's the same color. It has a lot of room, but it's also not too big and weird. It came like a week after,...I think you guys should consider it. :)"
2,light duty backpack,"Purchased it for junier high school student. it's not big enough and also you can not image how large it actually will be. Overall, it's low cost and low quality bag and you can buy it at local sports authority cheaper and easy to return or change it if you don't like it after receiving. Will not buy those bag anyway."
4,Great Backpack!,"Great Backpack! Love the color! The only thing, is that it gets dirty easily. I got a pen mark on the pocket, and I'm not sure how to remove it :("
5,I loved it :),JanSport is a great brand. The quality of their backpacks is great and the size is perfect. I would recommend it to everyone.
5,Perfect for a large tote size backpack,"I have a broken leg and am on crutches so I needed a light weight backpack to carry all my stuff and have my hands free. This has been perfect. It is very light but big enough to hold a sweater, etc as well as the former contents of my purse."
2,Not up to the standards of the first two LPs!,"Freak City Soundtrack finds our Chicago lads getting a little too close to their Marshall stacks - The Jesus & Mary Chain would be jealous of the feedback that permeates this record.For those who thought International Pop Overthrow was a little too candy-coated, you'll definitely get your fill of crunchy guitars on this one.The late Jim Ellison does a great job of taking the pi** out of ""guitar gods"" with his one-note solo during ""Help Me Land.""Still, I'd try IPO or DU (if you can find them) before FCS. Why these MI CDs go out of print in under five years while record companies continue to churn out copies of fossils like ""The Best Of Cat Stevens"" is beyond me."
1,Static in My Ears is more like it,"I'm all for giving local bands a chance and that's exactly what State of Being is, a local Cleveland band. And that's about as far as SOB is ever going to get by writing songs like this. If you enjoy thin sounding music created with Casio keyboards and lyrics that are reminiscent of sixth grade theatrics, then you'll more than likely enjoy the tracks on this disc. I had a problem just getting past the weak and monotone vocals.This disc did absolutely nothing for me. Other than make me wish that I were deaf.On a positive note, the lead singer is kinda cute."
1,Didn't fit application for 1993 Toyota MR2 Turbo,"This product has been shipping with the wrong specs, even through the official specs from Beck-Arnley describe fitment correctly. It is the rear rotor for the NA version of the mk2 MR2 as well as the earliest turbo mk2. Beware ordering it if time is tight due to the high potential for this error. I've contacted Beck-Arnley and alerted them of this, and they acknowledged my findings. Besides Amazon, at least one other commonly used distributor also has shipped these wrong sets. It's not the distributor's fault directly, and Amazon did recredit me within their refund/return timeframe."
3,Classic Comedy That Needs To Be On DVD,Class Act was a funny comedy when released in 1992. Kid & Play conuntied to make good comedy and are good comedic team. Doug E. Doug in an early sidekick role was alos very funny. My favorite scene in the movie is where Duncan is confused about slang and Blade has to explain it to him. I personally feel the filmmakers should have maybe gave Kid the Blade role and Play the Duncan but all in all still a funny movie.
4,One of my favorite 1990's flix,"Love this movie, as well as House Party 1 and 2. I used to watch all threeof these movies years ago. When are they going to release this movie on dvd?! i have been looking for it on dvd for the past 8 years now, I ownHouse Party 1 & 2 on dvd, but whats the deal with Class Act!"
4,THE LAST GOOD KID N PLAY MOVIE,"IN THIS ONE, KID N PLAY PLAY TWO TEENAGERS WHO SWITCH IDENTITIES WITH EACH OTHER AND THEY TRY TO ADAPT TO THEIR NEW LIFESTYLES. THIS WAS THE LAST GOOD KID N PLAY MOVIE. SUPRISINGLY, IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR AS FOUL MOUTHED AS THE HOUSE PARTY MOVIES WERE. FOR ANY FAN OF KID N PLAY, I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS."
1,Wounded the film career of Kid and Play,"This horrible, incredibly stupid and unfunny film was the next-to last nail on the coffin of Kid and Play's film career. Has all the ingredients of cinematic defecation 1) Unlikeable characters 2) A stale ""story"" (scholarly geek mistaken for a streetwise thug) 3) Outrageously corny dialogue 4) Horrendus ""acting."" I could go on and on, but you get the idea. ""House Party"" it ain't. Tom Joyner correctly referred to this film as ""Kid and Played-out!"""
3,class act,"this is the best of all kid n play movies, better acting and more comedy,and is a shame to waste a great movie on vhs.please bring to dvd."
4,Fuinny movie,"Movies through the years have parodied or utilized the 'Prince and the Pauper' schtick that Mark Twain spun out back in his day. Some have succeeded. Some others haven't. This is one of the former.Rather than spend their money throughout the school, the board has decided to focus most of their effort on one part of the school that teaches the straight-shooters/honor roll students, while the rest of the school is woefully neglected, with some comic effects (graffiti on the walls, etc) The story follows two teenagers, one in each part of the school. Before they can go to school though, the office switches the records by accident, so Goody Two-shoes ends up in the bad part of the school, while the gangsta ends up in the elite program.This is a comedy movie, so the effects of these two kids as they are placed in foreign environs is pretty funny, with some jokes and ribald humor."
3,3 .5 stars and a high top fade!,"Is the plot typical? Yes. Is some of the acting marginal at best? Absoltuley. Is the movie still fun? You bet!! I give it 3.5 stars because the movie's slapstick humor is no groundbreaking cinematic achievement at all. But Class Act manages to keep it's dignity and remains a ""class act"" in comparison to most teenie movies that do no better than being crass or downright nasty. I'm not sure if this is good or bad but it's more like a hip hop version of Happy Days (does anyone remember Happy Days anymore?) None of this review has anything to do with the fact that I was an extra in several scenes of the movie too! :-) Doug E. Doug bumps me pretty closely in the almost fight scene in the parking lot. There's a terrible over-dub of my voice saying ""Hey!!!"" My voice is much cooler than that!DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Had to have seen this before,"Classic movie, one that is funny and I admire if you are buying it, you have seen it before! K"
5,Classic,This is a good oldie. Love Kid & Play. We love watching old movies. Kid & Play knows how to keep us laughing.
1,Stuck in old Testament,I always liked Davids first books and was looking forward to reading the 2 end times books he wrote but his proof text is all old Testament and has NOTHING to do with America in fact the verses he used was spoken by the prophets for Israel only and not the Church. It has taken a real strong man to do what he has in the past sometimes just him and God but now that he older the same conviction of his teaching are making him unteachable and I fear just stuck in his own ideals. If you really want to know what going to happen to the world just stick to reading the book of Revelation. I threw his 2 books on the end times in the trash can so no one would be miss lead by them.
3,"Entertaining, violent, dark humor, and camp","Just a quick review with a few thoughts...I found Horrors Of The Black Museum (1959) to be darkly entertaining with dark humor and plenty of campiness. I mean that in a positive way. It is also somewhat violent with an emphasis on sadism.Michael Gough (Horror Of Dracula, Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher Batman franchise) as the museum owner is very intense in this movie. He gives a good, high energy performance. Overall, the acting in this movie is not bad.This isn't a great movie, but it isn't a bad movie, either. The DVD transfer isn't the best, but it's watchable. I recommend this movie for horror movie fans to see at least once."
3,Old-School Horror,This movie revolves around a series of rather elaborate and gruesome London murders. Although the plot twist kind of telegraphs itself ahead of time it has some good acting (at times a little too much of it) and some interesting background. Not one I'll watch 20 times but it's worth checking out.
4,Michael Gough is Alfred??,"My parents were always taking me to drive-in movies during the hey day when I was hoppin in the back seat. I remember Michael Gough quite vividly who always played the conservative, yet deranged well dressed man in a suit. For some reason, I completely forgot the name of this horror flick until recently, but will never forget that binocular scene. It rates right there with scenes from another spook thriller, (I remembered the name to this one), Dr. Terror's House Of Horrors. Saw it at the same drive-in around the same time. Still can't believe my folks took me to see a movie called ""Horrors Of The Black Museum"". To top things off, I also just learned he played Alfred the butler. That was the real shocker!"
4,Good rice,This rice has a good flavor. I keep them on hand when I need a quick side dish. Nice amount of spices.
2,In a nutshell,"This book was recommended reading during my studies on interior design, so I bought it without really looking into it. I was disappointed. Maybe I expected too much, maybe the title misled me, but it seemed very much based on thumbnail sketches and it wasn't what I was looking for. It is a thin little book full of rough pencil sketches that you could easily lose down the back of the sofa! (in a nutshell). I wanted to know the more indepth technical ways of doing perspectives and this book left me in the dark."
2,"A bear to get in, doesn't play nice with WinXP","I tried getting this product to work with my WinXP computer, and what wound up happening was a series of freezes, crashes, boot errors, and all sorts of miscellaneous problems. I finally just took the card out of that computer, because it was such a pain to deal with. Their tech support was non-existent.But, to make the best of it, I tried to put it in my Win2k computer. It took a few reboots and uninstall/reinstalls of the software and driver to get it working. But, once it got in, it worked just fine. A lot of effort though, if you're not concerned about the wireless-g you might want to go with a USB adapter."
5,Works great for me.,"All I had to do was follow the instructions that came with this thing and I was up and running wirelessly in no time. I have this card in my PC and it connects to a DI-624 (router/AP) with a strong signal strength, about 80%, at 2 rooms down the hall from the living room which has the main PC and the DI-624.The utility that came with this card is a very nice piece of software. It is intuative, good looking, and not too obtrusive.I'd recommend this card to others since it works great for me."
3,Windows 7 driver issues solved,"I had trouble with this device in Windows 7 64 bit. (It is no longer supported by D-Link for current operating systems)However, I WAS able to get it working by using instructions found here: [...]It is a GOOD card but because it is older than Windows 7 there were a few issues."
1,Blue Screen of Death,"BSD and system freezing is true. I removed this card and installed E-home and now I do not get BSD.I would like to find out, if all models of Dlink adapters have this problem."
1,A PCI Freeze-up nightmare,"This card is supposed to plug and play with a PCI bus. Unfortunately, it doesn't. It simply freezes the whole computer after a minute or so of running. No, I am not a numbskull, but an IT engineer with 40 years experience. What could be the problem. Well, first D-Link just don't want to recognise any issue, and their web-site FAQ gives no answer. Yes, XP is patched to the latest and greatest. And yes the Drivers are up to the latest. And yes, I did try shifting PCI slots, messing around with the DMA on or off, and evening trying other drivers known to work with D-Link. But regrettably it is back to the store. D-Link, shame on you for releasing such an unready and crap product. I know that 50% of us don't get freezes, but what about the 50% that do. Fortunately, I will get my money back. But no more fiddling around with cheap and untested junk."
3,Ya Got A Fifty-Fifty Chance,"Read all the magazine reviews and articles...thought this card was the way to go.So I bought two, plus a DI-624 router.My first install went great - my Compaq was up and wireless in less than 15 minutes (30 if you count install time).My second computer`s install dragged on for days.... The card appeared to install smoothly, with great signal strength and was an sight to behold - for about 3 minutes. Then it locked up my computer...everytime.NO solution, from bios upgrades to new drivers, went untried. But after a week I gave it up, went back to wired and returned the card.Something between the on-board sound and NIC cards caused a conflict - which froze the system within minutes of every reboot. My first PC didn`t have on-board components - which may have been the saver.You really take your chances with this card."
2,its OK,i was skeptical about buying this product since i seen it at best buy on clearance and since i heard and read all of the horrible reviews on d-link products but i decided to give it a shot anyway since it would save me a good amount of moneyanyway to start off this card has a mind of its ownsomedays it will stay connected all day and night and other times it wontand when it dosent stay online beware this card will freze your computer up in seconds(im running a dell XPS dimension 3 With 1GB of DDR2 ram and a 3.4 mhz processor..maybe im just an idiot and dont no anything about computers but that kinda makes me think that this product shouldnt be hogging my CPU usage)it also says that it has a 328 ft range indoors which is total of 10 meters) but funny thing is i cant connect past 50 ft.
5,Easy installation; Fast,"I am using this card on a home network with a Netgear Wireless-G access point. On the same wireless network, I have a Linksys Wireless USB Adapter (WUSB54G) and a Netgear PC card (WG511).Installation and set up of this card was easy. I installed it on a Windows 2000 desktop and the instructions were not very clear for Win2K, but I was able to figure it out without much sweat. Considering that almost everyone has Windows XP these days, this may not be a problem.The speed and performance is good - as good as it can get. On my network (at the same distance from the access point), this card and the WG511 are equally fast. With my ISP, my download speed is about 1.2mbps and upstream speed is 200kbps. The WUSB54G is pretty slow (must be because it is USB) - I get only < 300 mbps downstream."
3,Works...,This wireless card doesn't seem to have the umph that I want. My laptop gets much better reception with its built in wireless ability that this does. Leads me to want the new wireless-n router and cards.
2,Wish I had not bought this,"I bought the DI-624 and a DWL-G520. Bad, bad, bad, very bad.The problem is the g520. I cannot get any decent signal strength. I even added a 6db microstrip antenna and it made no difference at all. More money wasted. All I can get under any circumstance is very low signal strength. It works somewhat until it drops the signal entirely. How useless it that!!??This card is junk!! But at least it doesn't freeze my computer."
1,"Freeze, freeze and freeze again","Since purchasing the D-Link DWL-G520 adapter along with the DI-624 router my computer has done nothing but freeze. As I have now read, I am not the only one with this problem and it has been a very frustrating experience. I am thinking now of moving the adapter into another slot but wondering if it would be worth my trouble. Perhaps I shoud just purchase from Linkys???"
2,Good luck if you buy this product,"This product caused my PC (HP 8660C with Windows 98 SE) to freeze every time after 5-60 minutes of use. Installing the latest drivers on the PC and the D-Link router, as well as two calls to customer service, did not resolve the problem. Reading the other reviews, clearly this adapter works on some PC configurations and not others. You might be lucky, or you might spend many frustrating hours trying to get it working. I returned it and bought a Linksys router and adapter with speedbooster, which work great. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 star was the customer service, which was based in the US instead of India, and at least tried to solve the problem."
2,"Fair product, bad software","I purchased a DWL-G520 PCI card and installed it into my Dell 8200 desktop. The card works fine with my Belkin 802.11g wireless router and seems to give me good data speeds, but the included software to control the card and modify the settings does not work. It will not recognize the card in my system (""no card found""). I contacted D Link and they have a complicated procedure to remove the card, uninstall the drivers, reboot, reinstall the drivers, reboot, reinstall the card, blah, blah, blah... Needless to say it didn't work. I also have a sound blaster card so maybe that is the problem... I will be sending it back and getting the Belkin 54g PCI card. I have the Belkin 54g PCMCIA card for my laptop and didn't have any issues with the setup and use. If you go for the low cost solution..."
2,"Worked with one network, froze with another","I used this all summer long and had no problem... HOWEVER, i recently moved to another city and as soon as I connected to my new wireless network, my computer FROZE! I don't know what else to do but get a new adapter. Nothing has worked to resolve the problem. I don't understand why it worked fine for 3 months on one network but is total crap on another... [sigh]."
1,Freezes computer,"Like others, I had the computer freeze problem. I am running Windows 2000 Pro SP4, and even after removing all my other PCI cards, this product still froze my machine. I downloaded and installed the latest driver from D-Link's website to no avail. Be prepared to return this product."
1,Careful: Will Freeze Up Your Machine,"My experience is like a lot of others - I bought this unit with high expectations for good performance but found that it would regularly freeze up my machine. When I removed the offending unit the freezes were gone as well. Additionally, the installation manual had erroneous information in it. Ask yourself what kind of company would put out an untested product like this and still forge ahead with a clear conscience, and that just about sums up D-Link. I would recommend LinkSys or any other vendor until D-Link improves the quality, dependability, and reliability of their products."
2,"Statistics, a necessary evil",Book was in the condition stated arriving in a timely manner as specified.The text of this book was good but difficult to read. At times it seemed confusing as one chapter did not always flow into the next.
1,hubiewoodworker,"I ordered this book the 12th of July, it is 17th of Augustand I haven't seen it or know what happened to it.I havea lot of mixed thoughts about not getting the book. Was it the sellers fault or Amazons fault. I sure was disappointed. Hubie"
4,Statistics for Research Methods book I purchased,I ordered this book from Amazon and I also ordered it to be expedited for mailing. The text was here quick and was in excellent shape. I bought it used and was very pleased with the condition.BonnieCalifornia
2,A great idea but poorly presented,"The community impact evaluation methodology is certainly a complicated concept. While the author did go into great lengths to describe and explain it, he fell short of presenting it in a way that can be understood reasonably easily. In a book on a completely different subject matter (system development: requirement, evaluation, design, and implementation), the author Dr. Eleanor Jordan did a great job in showing how the various tools could be applied in the real world. Lichfield should certainly consider reading it before revising his book for the next edition, if there is going to be one."
4,The Art of Kicking Some [Rear]!,"I really liked this movie. I saw the other reviews and was surpised by them.I bought the movie really on the back of films like Blade, Passenger 57 and US Marshals. Its a good action film, one that holds your interest and is watchable again and again.Not sure I take my films as seriously as some others...I didn't see this as some American or UN jingoistic offering, I just saw Wesley beat the bad guys! ...and it was fun!If you like films like Mission Impossible, Chain Reaction, Three Kings, The Fugitive, etc... then I think you'll find this enjoyable."
3,okay action thriller,"Fairly engaging action thriller about U.N. covert operatives trying to salvage a trade agreement with China as various unsavories try to torpedo it. Snipes turns in a surprisingly wooden performance (I've come to expect better from him.) A fair number of martial arts scenes, with some pretty good moves, but the photography is poorly executed so that the fight scenes blow by in a flurry of fists and feet with no real opportunity to see the techniques being used. The primary device for generating excitement involves jumping from great heights and smashing through glass. An inordinate amount of glass is broken in this movie. Still, it moves along briskly, and is never dull."
3,Oh god..... this is poor,"This DVD is quite horrible... I am very dissapointed.... Yes the movie itself is pretty good, but the sound quality is very unsatisfactory! The music or score or whatever is 10x louder than the voices and the sound effects, there making everything hard to hear except the booming music. I had lots of trouble adjusting to this... even my father was mad I bought this because he couldn't make sense out of most of what they were saying... When I saw this movie in the theaters i think it was ok.... so i guess the dvd is the thing that was screwed up! OH well buy it at your own risk... i guess the action is ok... oh well for me i guess i just watch the action and not pay attention to the plot or anythign... oh well"
1,"Bad, really bad!","Haven't they made this kind of ""who done it"" movie so many times? And the little chinese actress ""what's her name"" looks fine, but can't really act at all. How can a guy be 2 places at one time? Com'on, enough already. I can't describe how bad it is... Just a waste of time!"
1,poor video quality,"poor video quality, I should ask for refund. The video quality was bad even on high speed internet, request amazon to upgrade their infrastructure and not impact customers."
1,Snipes Does James Bond,Wesley Snipes at one time was a great actor whose talents canboth be used in comedy & action films but it seems as of lateSnipes is choosing the wrong roles to further extend on hisacting abilties. ART OF WAR a film about U.N Operative who isrunning from his crooked employers as well as the police whenhe is accused of killing the chinesse ambassador. The film'saction scenes afre remiscent of James Bond films as well John Woo's style of direction but it fails on any original storyline.It's been done before but only better. Wesley Snipes Can doMuch better than this.
2,"So so action, and got nothing to do with Sun-Tzu","A dissapointment from Wesley Snipes. There is enough confusion in the beginnig to make the movie interesting. But the movie soon ran out the steam. The action sequences are too far fetched, like jumping from 2 stories high without breaking his leg, and the final shoot out sequence make you go ""yah, right"". The movie only made reference to Sun-Tzu's book ""Art of War"" once the whole entire movie. I expected better performance from Wesley Snipes."
2,At least it's better than Blade.,"After the horrendous Blade, Wesley Snipes goes with an espionage thriller in The Art of War, a film that's pretty weak and suffers from a lack of action and a good story. Snipes himself is decent, as is the rest of the cast, but when the action is this little, the film starts to get tedious after awhile. There are a few inspired touches, such as high-noon showdown at the end that is obviously reminiscent of The Matrix, complete with bullets moving in near slow motion. Aside from these sort of scenes, The Art of War features a lame story that goes nowhere."
5,The Art of Martial-Arts Film-Making!,"I don't care what anybody says!...In my opinion, as far as American action-movies with martial-arts are concerned, ""The Art of War"" is flat out THE BEST! Forget Van Damme, forget Seagal, Snipes fights well & he's a legitimate, competent actor to boot!This is an espionage, spy thriller with Snipes as a U.N. security agent. The plot centers around a conspiracy to thwart American-Chinese trade negotiations. There are double & triple crosses galore & this film has the feel of an updated film-noir classic, MTV style.If you like well-made martial-arts films as much as I do, ""The Art of War"" is for you!"
1,The Art of Bad Moviemaking,"I've seen some bad movies. Some horrible movies in fact, but nothing, absolutely nothing, as bad as this. This is the result if you take bad editing, stolen scenes, and no plot and throw money at it.From the beginning where Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes) gets in a fight at a major event and the event ""never happened"" to the public to the scene where a sniper kills a major diplomat at a major U.N. event. Does no one have security details in these things?His intuition of bombs in backpacks and the events that happened in the translators apartment are also quite unbelievable. If he's that talented shouldn't he be working for Ms. Cleo instead of risking his butt?The ending to this movie is a direct rip off of ""The Matrix"", unfortunately neither of the characters are superheroes so it comes off as ridiculous.Don't Waste your Money. And someone please convince Wesley Snipes not to waste his time or talent."
2,"Average Movie, Substandard Acting","I wasn't expecting too much when I rented The Art of War, just some mindless action entertainment. In all reality there isn't enough action in this film. Wesley Snipes plays a role that he's played a thousand times before, renegade cop. The plot twists in this film are right out of the 1990's action screen writing handbook. One thing I will say in favor of this film is that the martial arts sequences were accurately portrayed. Good hand to hand combat sequences and no Matrix style garbage. The plot is actually not bad, involving the UN and a US/China free trade agreement but The Art of War is not worth the time. Wesley Snipes should actually starting reading the scripts he chooses to sign on for."
1,A Poor Excuse for a Film,"It's final. Wesley Snipes has been type cast. No one can deny that. In this action thriller, Snipes plays Neil Shaw, a covert operative working for the U.S. Government. After years of service, one of his team-mates gets killed and then he is pinned for the death of a high foreign national. Now he is on the run looking for the person who did this to him. This is nowhere near Snipes' best. In my opinion Jungle Fever or Boiling Point show his true acting ability. It is overly violent, using Matrix style matial arts as one of its' the key selling points. I figured out the so-called ""mystery"" in the first few minutes of the movie. Even with a talent filled supporting cast; Donald Sutherland (Disclosure, Shadow Conspiracy), Anne Archer (Patriot Games), and Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator). This movie couldn't be helped. One to steer clear of it at all possible."
2,Just not that good,"This is one of those movies that starts and ends like hundreds of others do. It seems like I had already seen this movie before. The action scenes were just like any other action movie. Fights in moving cars and people chasing each other through buildings in New York City just shouldnt impress anyone who watches action movies anymore. If you want to watch an action movie for the sake of watching an action movie then its not that bad, but certainly not good by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Hong Kong inspired Action makes it bearable,"Art of War is not a great film, but it sure is entertaining: to a point. Its actions scenes, though not as violent as you want them to be, are heavily reminiscent of John Woo-type action.Though Snipes has done better, he seems to be having a good time playing a UN spy. All in all, the movie is OK right up until the end fight scene where Snipes and his old rival fight it out using the stunning technique of Bullet-Time utilized in the Matrix."
2,Horrible product!,I had to actually flip this dvd over to watch the end of the movie. It almost seems as though it could be a bootleg.
1,A classical,"A classical of bad taste. The plot is pathetic, the acting terrible... I really regret the 3 dollars I paid for renting this movie."
3,Hollywood,"This is a typical hollywood movie, in both good and bad way. First, the budget is big, the premise thought provoking, and the actions scenes well directed. Those are the good parts.The bad includes the casting: wesley snipes is black, his boss is female, his love interest is an asian diplomat w a nose ring, and his sidekick a cop who while theoretically italian is obviously jewish and speaks in yinglish. More hollywood postive discrimination than you can shake a stick at. Also the plot totally sucks, and is best disregarded (altho the concerns about china and so forth are interesting, the way things play out is completely hokey). All in all worth seeing, but not a must see by any means. I wouldn't pay full price, if I were you... (I bought it used)."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I love Wesley Snipes, I have enjoyed many of his movies, but this is one is really really bad. It is painful to watch this film, if you can even call it that. The only part of this movie I found cool was the credit sequence at the beginning and the opening shot. The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose. The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown. The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly. The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable. The one-liners made me cringe. The conversations between the characters is the same old, same old. This movie is completely unwatchable, and I recommend you don't watch as it will destroy your respect for Wesley, which no one want to happpen."
1,Narcissistic Adaptation,"The book, ""The Orchid Thief"" is wonderful. It is ashame that it is connected to the narcissistic screen play and movie ""Adaptations"". The only thing in common are the character names. I hope someone else will do justice to the book in the future. If I could have picked a negative star (black hole) I would have. I watched the whole thing, because I had read the book. I felt cheated by this ""cop out"" movie. Everyone I was watching it with fell asleep. It was a true disappointment after reading the book."
2,"""Jumps the alligator"" early and goes downhill fast","Oh boy, so much of this movie is so wrong. From the overheated casting (Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep) to the destructive and cynical plot, ""Adaptation"" is a director's star turn that falls flat on its face. What happened to the cool detachment and finely-drawn characters of ""Being John Malkovich""? Sorry, Charlie, but your own writers-block is never good material for a film, especially when it turns out this overplayed and underwritten. Chris Cooper is easily the best thing in this movie (no front teeth to chew the scenery with...) and the Florida Everglades never looked so beautiful. A very unfunny movie that's capsized by its own smug attitude."
2,"Although the acting is pretty good, to sum up Adaptation","in one word: pretentious. I couldn't get into the struggle of adapting The Orchid Thief that the Nicholas Cage character was experiencing because I found the whole premise behind The Orchid Thief to be pretty lame. As a result, the Meryl Streep/Chris Cooper segment of the movie was pretty uninteresting which made the Nicholas Cage segment of the movie just as uninteresting. I had high hopes for Adaptation because I really liked Being John Malkovich. Oh well, this usually happens to sophomore efforts."
2,Maybe a computer wrote this movie,"In the 1960's I read a rather minor science fiction story about a frustrated writer. During the course of the story he developed a computer program that would generate random sentences. He then turned the computer loose to print millions of lines every day hoping that a novel would eventually come out. He had lots of frustrations--including the computer writing 3/4 of a wonderfully good novel. Unfortunately, he wasn't a good enough author to finish it.The last two lines of the story were a repeat of the lines that began it--giving the impression of a computer writing a story about a computer writing a story...I hadn't thought about this story in years but after watching this movie I did. And one of the thoughts was that I liked the old story better."
1,WTF,"I am very, very, very confused as to how this movie is getting an average of 3.5 stars.Now I can understand that some aspects of a cluttered film like this one can be appealing to some but I have no clue as to how somebody could derive enjoyment from the plot. The movie played like a broken record: nick cage would complain (in a voice over) about his fat balding body, his brother (also nick cage) would talk for awhile then main character nick cage would try an aspect of the story and end up masterbating.This must have happened five or six times in the film with parts about the wirting of the book that this crap movie is based on. I don't see how the production studio could get away with the plot they used. They portrey the actual writer of the book (a very real person) as a insecure, ugly, drug attic who tries to kill the brothers (It's a shame she coulden't didn't succeed sooner).In Conclution this movie was a piece of sh**. save yourself some money and skip this one."
1,Skip it,This movie was one of the worst I have seen in a very long time. Couldn't even finish watching it. Don't waste your time.
3,Ok,Watched this film for a school assignment and found it to be a one-timer. An interesting combination of real and fancy.
3,Comedy Not at it's best,"this is one of the worst comedies i've seen, it's an okay movie, the only reason it's okay its because of nick cage. other than that it's dumb"
2,You don't have to be dumb to hate this one.,"I guess if you think you're smart and an extreme film buff, then you could go with the flow of critics and give this one 5 stars, but if you're looking for anything even remotely entertaining as ""Being John Malchovich"", then you will be sorely sorry you decided on this piece of fluff.The story moves at a snails pace, the acting is sub-par(Don't even know why Chris Cooper got an Oscar) and the only chemistry going for it, is Nicolas Cage playing off of...Nicolas Cage.It's not as smart or intellectually stimulating as ""Malchovich"", and I know it's not the same movie, but when you have the same director and writer, you do expect something close to being as original and funny as ""Being John"".Skip it, you won't miss anything in this over-hyped and uninteresting film."
1,Where's the Writer?,"Surely one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films with memory. Fabulous acting by Chris Cooper, Meryl Streep and Nick Cage can't save this dog. Somebody should have told Charlie Kaufman what Tom Lehrer once said -- that people with nothing to say should just shut up!"
1,Can you spell awful?,"If you really like off-the-wall, totally asynchronous, completely non-linear stories, this is it. If you consider yourself a mainstream movie buff, you'll probably think this is the worst movie of the year.For me, this was not entertaining, fun, or even amusing. I kept looking at the time on the DVD player, trying to guess when this...would end.The DVD doesn't even include ""the making of"" extra material to explain what I just saw. My only comparison is ""Being John Malkovich"" - if you like one, you'll like the other."
4,"Almost, but not quite, Excellent...","The first 3/4 of this movie are superb. You're sitting there and you're thinking, ""Yes.. this is why I love movies.""And then it turns into a standardized piece of crap.Now, I understand what the writer/director are doing here.. I get that that's a conscious decision.. that the ""other"" writer is writing that last part, and that it's almost a parody of all the things the ""first"" writer didn't want in his movie.. there's a car chase, guns, drugs, sex, straightforward narrative, etc.But, what I don't get is, why not make the whole movie great, instead of going to all the trouble of making the first 75% so good, only to cop out on the ending? Why do that???Definitely worth seeing, but brace yourself for an unsatisfying conclusion..."
5,Adaptation,"This is the kind of movie you watch, and you just can't really talk to anybody about it because it is so different from any other movie you have ever seen. This is probably the most original movie I have ever seen. The best way I can describe it is that it is about the screenwriter writing this movie about a screenwriter writing a movie about a book. If that confuses you, or even if it doesn't, go rent this movie. The story, if you can call it a story, is interesting, the characters are entertaining and thought provoking, and it is the only movie thus far where I have honestly said ""Wow, Nicholas Cage CAN act."""
3,"Very Good Movie, but NO DVD Extras","""Adaptation"" is a really interesting, well-acted movie. At times, the script is rather self-conscious, but it contains enough smart jabs at the movie industry to create a nice balance. Some of lines are pretty brilliant and will stick with me for awhile. So why only 3 stars? Because of a disappointing DVD package....I skipped seeing ""Adaptation"" in the theater, mostly because I eagerly anticipated the DVD extras. This movie is the kind of twisty, fairly intellectual movie that you'd expect to have a plethora of extras (especially DVD commentaries). Sadly, the only extra on this version is the trailer (I'm sure you saw it plenty of times in theaters). Ok, I understand that not every moviemaker wants to record a DVD commentary, but ""Adaptation"" was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year. A real disappointment, and I'll be even more disappointed if a Deluxe Version is released a few months from now."
4,Beautiful movie!,"My guess the main theme of this movie is the creative process and how difficult and torturous it is. In this case it's about writing a movie script by Charlie Caufman, played by Nicolas Cage. It is very unusual movie about movie about the book. I was surprised to find out that the book 'The Orchid Field' that the movie supposed to be based on is the real book. It makes the movie even more fascinating. You never know with Spike Jonze. I loved references here to his other movie 'Being John Malkovich"". The acting is superb but especially by Meryl Streep (as always) and Chris Cooper. The only complain I have that it is sometimes too slow. I am not the one who watches action movies only but in this case this slowness is just not warranted and out of the rhythm of the movie. But in the end it could be just a fault of Charlie Caufman."
1,FOUL!,"Don't get me wrong, I GET this movie's message. The problem is ... the message [is bad]. The movie had great promise, great cast, and it took all that greatness and completely crashed and burned. And yes, that is the point, but it honestly went beyond Hollywood cliché. It was something more putrid and disturbing that can only hide its ugliness behind the guise of a Hollywood cliché. The joke is not on the people that didn't get that this movie's point was failure; the joke is on the people that think this movie had some masterful point. People who loved the movie laugh at the `nave' people who hated it; meanwhile Kufman is laughing at all the people that think he is making any statement at all! It is [horrible] disguised as cleverness.I am a movie lover, a Meryl lover, and was intensely excited about the release of this film (having loved Kaufman's previous work), yet it was the only movie I have ever seriously wanted to walk out on. Painfully disappointing."
1,"An annoying, nerve-destroying film","Being a screenwriter myself, a story about another writer should be interesting, but this is pure self-indulgence by the writer, and the producers should be slapped for spending money on his indulgence. A more loathsome creature onscreen I have never seen than the scriptwriter's persona played by Cage. Cage is good, as is Street, and Cooper gives an excellent performance, but the whole film had me feeling like I was covered by ants biting me all over until my nerves were raw. Maybe it is just me, but I am tired of Oliver Stone-type movies where quick cuts abound, and you have to move fast to avoid being hit by some off-the-wall filming. I miss linear storytelling."
2,BEING BIZARRE,"Maybe it's a case of 'liking this sort of thing', but I found ""Adaptation"" to be, like the writer and director's ""Being John Malkovich"", just too complicated and silly to be enjoyable, with a plotline running in and out of the lines of ironic boundary. This is even a little less impressive as it concerns the reliable dramatic device of a man and his twin brother, who may or may not be a figment of the other's imagination. Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper offer dynamic performances in the principal leads but it's the increasingly bizarre and emotionless story which gives the thing an impenetrably chilly air."
1,More Hollywood Schlock,"Yet another braindead, hollow, formulaic Hollywood concoction with the standard ingedients: load up on bankable stars, throw tons-o-money at it, pump up the ""buzz"" and voila!, another Hollywood blockbuster.I can't believe all the hype surrounding this movie. An inane script with absolutely nothing important to say about anything. And what's with all the buzz surrounding the Kaufman's? You'd think they were the Next Coming the way critics go on and on about their supposed brilliance. It amazes me to see how much praise is bestowed upon writers whose only strength is their cleverness. As if being clever constitutes great screenwriting. Does ""Memento"" ring a bell?"
4,"Adaptation, DVD","The film is nothing like the book, The Orchid Thief, but it is an amusing story with greats like Meryl Streep and Nicholas Cage and the actor, Cooper. I enjoyed the scenes set in Miami, Broward county and the Everglades, swamps I had hiked in, too. I recently became interested in orchid culture and so The Orchid Thief book was recommended. Most of it set in Miami-Dade county where I live; many of the sites and people I am familiar with. I recently met people who had had disastrous dealings with the hero, John LaRoche, and was regaled with these hilarious stories. They all encouraged me to see the film, which they loved and they felt had a very satisfying ending , to them.I purchased several copies of the DVD to give as Christmas gifts, which were much appreciaterd and enjoyed."
5,Loved it!,"This is absolutly one of the most original movies to come out this year. I loved every moment of it! Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, and Chris Cooper all turn in excellent performances in this film directed by Spike Jonze. It is amazing how Charlie Kaufman can write such wonderful movies. You must see this. It was awesome, and definitly should take home some Oscars!"
1,"Overly-hyped, cliched and tired","The film is comic at points but its juxtaposition of caricatures are just that. As parody its representations are too broad to provide the kind of delight one finds in say, ""Dr. Strangelove."" I wouldn't recommend even wasting a Netflix rental on it."
1,Horrible. Uninteresting pitifull characters.,"I tried to watch this movie, I made it through over and hour of torture and shut it off.Maybe my expectations were too high. The critics loved this movie, they called it funny. Big name actors. I thought it was... junk. Too much unhappiness and dispair for me."
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"Saw this movie thinking it truly must be worth all of the hype. Not that far into it I turned to my friend and said ""If Nicholas Cage masturbates one more time, I'm leaving!""Shining perfomance (once again) by Chris Cooper, and the story between him and Meryl Streep was worth watching. However in this film, their wonderful performances were wasted.As for Nick, I generally like the guy, but this movie was a stretch for him. The entire time I felt as though I was watching a guy who was acting, and not as if I were in the story. Not sure what all of the buzz was about. Truly a disappointment in my view.Spend your money on ""Lost in Translation."""
2,A Tedious Exercise,"Adaptation straddles the border between being clever and being smug. There were some amusing scenes, but by the end of the film I felt that the filmmakers probably had more fun making the film than I actually had watching it. Despite Jonze's amusing camera tricks, this probably worked better as a screenplay than it does as a film."
1,A movie about trying to make a movie?,"Look, I understand very well that I'm supposed to find this thing ""brilliant, innovative, unique"" and so forth. But to begin with, the storyline of making a movie about making a movie is old, tired, and absolutely lackng in originality. This yawner wastes a good cast in telling a ho-hum tale about a mediocre writer. By the end of this thing, I really wanted those 90 minutes of my life back. The humor is lame, the situations are absurd, and the plot is devoid of interest."
1,If anything happens in this movie.......,"I rented this film hearing good things about it, and only veiwing bad things. Nothing really happens till the end of the movie, half of it is flashbacks, and everything just seems to have no end. The only good charactor is the kauffman brother who is wrighting the screenplay ""The 3"". And he is annoying. The only time this movie even tends to pick up is at the end of it (which by then u have probubly turned off the movie and thrown it in the trash.) STAY AWAY FROM THIS PEICE ..."
3,A Different Kind of Movie,"OK, I haven't seen it yet but I'm going to see it very soon. In fact I bought it for my boyfriend who thinks it's one of the greatest movies ever made. I am tentatively giving it a 3 stars, not because I think it is awful, but because I don't hold high expectations for it. If I wasn't dying to see it in the theatres, then I figure that it wasn't worth my time or money. But I am hoping that my preconceptions about this movie are wrong, so here goes nothing!"
1,"""Adaptation"" of a Disaster","""Adaptation"" will, probably, be remembered among the 10 worst films produced in this Century.Why the talented and beautiful Meryl Streep agreed to be part of this fiasco will, probably, remain known only to her. The story line & script would become lost in the eye of a needle. Gage plays his usual neurotic self. How this film won any awards is beyond me. I will not type the rating that I would give it."
5,A great film by Charlie Kaufman...so what's new?,"This movie is absolutely great. It has great humor, action, and drama...not to mention, Nicholas Cage is actually good in it. Yes, the same Nicholas Cage guilty of having the worst fake accent EVER (in Con-Air) is really believable (and funny, in the case of Donald Kaufman) in this movie. The rest of the cast is also great, and the script is just plain brilliant. You can tell Kaufman had fun writing this one, and it is a hell of a lot of fun to watch."
5,An Amazing Movie,"I'm not going to waste my time giving a plot synopsis of this movie. In fact, its rather difficult to give a proper review, as this movie goes in so many different directions and has so many different themes and ideas behind it. However, unlike most movies that do this, this one doesn't fail. Quite the opposite, it succeeds in just about every aspect that it can, in my opinion. Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen."
2,Different but not necessarily good,"It's been a month since I saw this movie and I still have the same feelings. I didn't like it, because it fails to deliver a clear message to the viewer, who in this instance would like to know why some things happen. Some of the scenes are very graphic (i.e. car accident) and shatter the viewer. I personally feel that few too many events lack cohesiveness and become extreme for no apparent reason.Pros: Good actors, good performancesCons: A movie that will leave you with a big question mark"
1,Irredeemably awful movie. Buy or rent at your peril!,"Having enjoyed ""Being John Malkovich"" I was ready for an offbeat, untidy but funny movie. What this high-powered team delivered instead was a meandering, pointless, self-indulgent movie. They kept trying to tell the story from different perspectives, but this is no Rashomon and Jonze is no Kurosawa.Anyway, as you can see from the other reviews here, others felt very differently. All I can say is (1) you've been warned! (;-) and (2) if you nevertheless rent or buy it and find that you hate the first 15 minutes, PLEASE just turn it off at that point and go off and do something more productive and enjoyable. Which would be almost anything you can think of!"
1,Might be the only one but I hated it.,"From reading the other reviews it seems that everyone else loved this film more than I did. I wanted to leave the cinema (two of my friends did) when I went to see it. I found the story between Meryl Streep and Chris Cooper well acted and touching but I was irritated by the parts of the film that featured Nicolas Cage's character, Charlie. For me it was almost as if he was getting in the way and I left the cinema with the distinct impression that I would have enjoyed it much more if I had simply read the book."
2,the insane New York state of mind?,If this is critically acclaimed as a movie than we have New york critics who arein therapy or need to be? I suppose there are two ways to look at this movie:a through the looking glass comedy about intellectual instabilityor just a play by someone who should probably be in prison forthe safety of the community? Something like van Goghcutting off his ear without the excuse of great art?In the decline of the Roman Empire the ruling class just lost it.That behavior seems to be the state of New York in the entertainment industry?People get critically acclaimed for making trash andcalling it art.I think the totally lost fellow who gives the screen writing classkind of sums up how bad thing really are?
5,One of the most original films I've ever seen,"...worth repeated viewings!Spike Jonze (director) and Charlie Kaufman (screenwriter) have done it again, this is on par with ""Being John Malkovich,"" another masterpiece they put together! Strikingly original, beautifully shot and acted, the ending might seem a bit disappointing until you figure out how it works within the movie's overall structure as a movie about making/writing movies."
4,great movie,this is a really great movie and an unusual one at that. nicolas cage plays a double roll and meryl streep is great too. top stuff.
2,I lost interest halfway through.,"Adaptation had my attention until the strange and boring second half. The only thing I liked about this dark comedy was Nicholas Cage and Chris Cooper, they are the two finest actors around. Meryl Streep wasn't designed for this type of role, she overacts sometimes. I cannot even explain the plot, it is so confusing. I was expecting greatness, jeez Spike Jones is out of his freakin' mind! Don't waste your money on this lackluster comedy."
4,Like trying to see the Sistine Chapel in one glance,"It's fantastic. Profound. But I'd have to watch it twice in order to digest everything it threw at me, it was mildly disorienting."
5,Brilliant??,"It's funny how often people use the word brilliant when describing this movie. It is not a word that you hear very often in reference to a movie and when you do the movie being described usually doesn't deserve it. This is a rare exception to that, it is a brilliant, brilliant movie. Another amazing script from the now Academy Award winning Charlie Kaufman, directed beautifully by the future Academy Award winning Spike Jonze. In my opinion these two aer just about the best people working in Hollywood today. Both movies they have teamed up on blew me away, and I can hardly wait for their next masterpiece.There is really nothing else to say about this movie. If you have seen it you know what I am talking about, and if you haven't you need to."
1,"Over-rated, lame-arsed-pomo dreck...","Well, at least Kaufman seems to know that he can't write a third act to save his (or his fictional brother's) life. The emperor is officially desnudo, my friends."
1,No good,"The one truth in this movie is when screenwriter Charlie reviles himself for turning a screenplay about The Orchid Thief into a screenplay about himself. I agree! Cage as Charlie is embarrassing - he seems to be trying to copy Woody Allen. The only good moments here are provided by Streeps and Cooper (Streeps is especially good). The rest is a waste of time. And the concluding segment, where Charlie gives in to his twin Donald and produces an ""action"" ending, is just silly. Very disappointing! I had high hopes and simply don't understand the enthusiasm others have expressed."
1,"Horrible, Horrible Movie","Chris Cooper and Meryl Streep are great. Nicholas Cage is not very good. The movie as a whole was extremely boring, disjointed, and horribly written. I was really excited to see this movie. It had gotten rave reviews and friends recommended it. What a big disappointment. Don't waste your time. Skip over this one and see something else."
1,"don't be fooled, this movie is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!","like many unfortunate souls out there, i had heard how great adaptation was, blah blah blah. i rented it and proceeded to utterly waste two hours of my life. i'm writing this for one reason only: to try to stop you from doing the same. believe me, even bill and ted's is a better film. this movie is pathetic."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie was BY FAR the worst movie I have EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, that is not an exaggeration. When I saw it, I went for free to the Sneak preview screening compliments of my local radio station, so I didn't actually waste any money on this atrocity (thank the gods). However, It was so utterly bad that I felt I had still been wronged for having wasted my TIME having gone. In addition, this movie has in fact ruined Nicholas Cage for me FOREVER, I cannot take him seriously anymore. The worst mistake he ever made was agreeing to make this movie. If I had a copy, I would not sell it, I would BURN IT!!!"
4,Ummm...different; enjoyable if you know the background,"I'd hate to have been plopped in front of a screen to watch 'Adaptation' without......having seen 'Being John Malkovich'......knowing of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's intense self-loathing......knowing that with Spike Jonze at the helm, anything can happen (and usually does)......understanding the cult that has grown up around screenwriting guru Robert McKee.With all that as background, it's a fun movie. Without that knowledge, it'd probably be like navigating Tokyo without a map. Pretty close to impossible.One comment about the action itself: for a movie that starts slowly and deals with the ostensibly sedate subject of flowers, Jonze has inserted the two most realistic, violent car crashes ever caught on film.And that alone tells you all you need to know about the unexpected road this movie travels down over the last hour."
5,Wackily Brilliant,"To call this movie odd is an understatement. But I just read Orchid Fever: A Horticultural Tale of Love, Lust, and Lunacy and read The Orchid Thief earlier. It seems that an odd movie is all you can make of this subculture.Meryl Streep in luminous, as usual and Nicholas cage pulls off a self-conscious screenwriter with bad hair, but it was Chris Cooper who blew me away with his Oscar winning performance of John Laroche. That alone, was worth the price of admission.The ending got a bit out of hand, but by the time we get there, we realize that it fits perfectly onto this wacky, brilliant movie."
1,"this is a very bad movie, except for Meryl Streep","If you are a pathetic loser, and you like to watch movies writen by pathetic losers that are about themselves being a pathetic loser, then you should definitely watch this movie.An author writes a book that is to be written into a screenplay, and the screenwriter is such a self-indulgent twit that he writes the movie about himself (the movie is all about what a loser he is). Meryl Streep made the movie bearable (she's gorgeous here). Don't eat just before watching this movie, because you'll see shots of a shirtless Nicholas Cage."
1,Don't bother!,"This is a horribly disappointing film. Reviewers that give this thing more than two stars are doing a prospective buyer no favor. Cage remains his usual one-dimensional self. The story is...boring. Very few of us are going to hang in there with a tale of a flower. Trust me on this one guys! The ""twin brothers"" (Cage in both roles) are confusing, as Cage is still Cage. Set your sights higher and buy any other new release. You can only improve your shopping cart."
2,watch something else,Nicolas Cage is brilliant in his interpretation(s) but I can't understand how this movie can get 5 stars... it is boring boring boring and quite ridiculous in some scenes.
1,Kaufman at his worst.,"I find it funny that someone almost one an oscar for a film about a writer's ""lack of talent"". Kaufman was assigned to write a movie about Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"", but instead he came up with a biography of himself and his failure to make an adaptation of the book. This isn't a film it's a documentary of Kaufman's failure to screenwrite."
1,what a waste of time..,"The movie is so lame and boring!! And what irritated me the most was the character played by Nicolas Cage - Charles Kaufman. He is such a pathetic loser, halfway thru I wanted to jump into the movie and slap him hard !This is one of those attempts to show a messed up movie and characters, try and make a mix of fantasy-n-reality. Some directors know how to do it and it works, but Spike Jonze is not one of them.And to top it all, the ONLY special which the DVD contains is the theatrical trailer!!!!!!!!! Nothing else. Run away, faaar faaar away.Hmmm..one thing which I wanted to say that there are 2 car crash sequences in this movie which were like - friggin' amazing. Gave me quite a jolt. Just mentioned, that's all..."
4,"""Adaptation is a beautiful process""","In this film, adaptation has two meanings. The confusing but brilliant story follows a Hollywood screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage). Who is struggling miserably to adapt Susan Orlean's ""The Orchid Thief"" to a screenplay. With his twin brother Donald (also Cage) who also becomes a screenwriter, both their stories blend in beautifully when they help each other escape the swamp from Orlean and John Laroche (Chris Cooper) who are armed with rifles. Adaptation comes with a fantastic screenplay written by the real Charlie Kaufman. Chris Cooper won an academy award for best supporting actor. One of the year's best."
3,Be prepared for the bizarre twists.,"I'm not here to bash the film; I personally thought everyone played a dynamic part, thus making it quite intricate.Don't watch this movie if you're in a good mood, it'll only leave you depressed and questioning the characters of your friends and wondering how short your life is.N. Cage did an excellent job playing a double of himself, but I wasn't prepared for the twists and turns of his character or Meryl Streep's character. It was almost like something out of Final Destination 1 and 2.The movie did a great job of keep me guessing, and even though I was depressed by a lot of the scenes I was drawn back to following the storyline and the characters until the end."
3,fresh but boring,"this is the kind of film critics have an orgasm over. it's fresh, it's not cut out of the 'hollywood mould', it's quirky in a funny sort of way. a lot like 'being johnny m'. for all that, it's still boring. and it's boring because the central character is boring. you wouldn't want to spend two minutes, much less two hours, with what's his name,...'adaptation' is just another one of those movies that's more fun to make than it is to watch.art film? yes. fun film? no."
4,Brilliant and sooo different...,"I will admit that when I first started watching this movie I thought..""Oh No..this is going to be a boring one..""...I was so wrong. Give this movie a chance because once it begins to really build its momentum..it just keeps getting wilder and wilder. I found it interesting that it was sort of like a movie within a movie, and though I havent been pleased with his work lately, I think that Nicholas Cage was phenomenal in this flick. I highly recommend this. I can guaraantee that it is unlike anything that you have ever seen."
5,A must have for die-hard Verve fans,"I'll have to admit that it's not quite what I expected from The Verve, but it's very good none the less. The video features about 20 of The Verve's songs, including 3 music videos, and the elusive Drugs Don't Work video. Unfortunately a lot of the ""interviews"" (IF you can call them that) are hard to hear because there is music being played simultaneously, but that's acceptable. All in all, the video is for die-hard Verve fans only; others might consider it a waste of money."
1,This is horrible,"I'm sorry, there is something very sick about this CD. These kids have absolutely no talent and sing about things like insects stealing your food. Whoever created this CD has made a mockery of ""mentally challenged"" kids everywhere. I tried as hard as I could not to laugh at this, but....I'm afraid it's impossible"
2,Fantastic,What a wonderful CD. I really like the song New Car and 65 Years Old. I like to dance to New Car in my room. Mirror Mirror on the wall baby. I just can't get enough of this stuff. I want MORE. Please make more albums. Please? For me? D Schmidt from Nebraska is also a great fan. D Smith from Detroit loves it too. Does anybody know if they are still together and if they play live at all? Please let us know.
1,What a Joke,I have to say that I don't feel I need to say this music is good because these kids are retarded. I laugh every time i listen to this. I feel bad for the people with normal mentality who produce it and play the instruments for these kids. HILARIOUS. All the people who say its good are probably just a bunch of single white females with no lives who complain about everything and blame violence on t.v and video games.This CD sucks. But it gets me laughing
1,ITZ FUNNy,Fun fun fun eee. It's a kewl CD if you like funny stuff. they do good singing and stuff Primary reinforcement is probly the funnest
5,"Quick, easy and delicious side dish","My husband prepared this pasta for our family and added grilled salmon and petite green peas to it for a quick dinner. He sprinkled some parmesan cheese on it for added flavor and it turned out great. It has a creamy, cheesy sauce that isn't too rich. He used 4 pouches to feed our family of 7 and there was enough left over for he and I to bring to work for lunch the next day.With a special promotion the cost was just over $1 per pouch which is a resonable price. Without the promo price it would cost more that I'm willing to pay."
1,Peal S. Blech!,"Please dont read this. You may have read other Pearl S. Buck. You may have liked other Pearl S. Buck. But please don't read this. Don't shame yourself.If you do read it, be prepared for the worst. Woody Allen wrote <Bullets over Broadway> ""People dont tawk wike dat!"" And in this book they dont. There is nothing in here worth reading, out of a college assimilation course (Which I hope doesnt exist because no one deserves to read this.) The whole book is about some Chinese maid living in a Jewish families house in China, but the characters are too many and too complex, don't expect to be able to relate to any of them.Just a warning!"
3,But why?,"This is the story of the final assimilation of a Jewish community that had existed in China for almost a thousand years. While we see the assimilation, we have no sense of why it is happening just at the time of the novel. Some characters do develop, but some are so simply portrayed that one wonders if Ms. Buck knew her subject well. A little too preachy, but a good easy read. Not her best."
2,Peony Review,"Peral S. Buck is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not the best. I might have misread the summary before ordering it, but I thought it was about Peony marrying a foreigner. Although it is a narrative about her love, it dragged on. The history of the jewish colony in China was interesting. I would not choose to read it again."
4,Satisfied/pleased with product,"As described, the book was in very good shape for an older book; it showed it's age, in yellowed pages. and a bit of wear evident in the cover. No underlining or other markings; I like that."
5,Pearl Buck,"My grandmother put the book Peony by Pearl Buck in my hands when I was about 14 years old. I hadn't even heard of The Good Earth! (This was in the 1960's) It is still one of my all time favorite books, along with Pavilion of Women and Imperial Women. I still have my grandmother's Pearl Buck books on my shelf and re read them often! I convinced my book club to read Pavilion of Women and they all loved it. Madame Wu could be right here with us now! Highly recommmend these reads."
2,Not a true client,"I bought this AP to be a wireless client for my PS2. Read the fine print, it will only act as a wireless client if you have another dwl-2000ap on your network. I tried and failed to get it to work with a di-624 wireless router. It doesnt make sense to me why they would even advertise this feature if it wont even work with their own products. DLink stated they were working on a firmware upgrade to make it compatible but no word on that yet. I'm going to look at the Linksys wet54g next, hopefully I will have better luck."
5,128-bit WEP and 54Mbps bandwidth,"I plugged this into my router and installed the D-Link DWL-G650 and I was connected to the AP upon start up. Very easy. Then from there I configured the AP to my specifications (128-bit WEP encryption, non-default SSID, and a new admin login) then I was set and secure. I get good speeds, no lag for gaming, and good range. let's just say I can be in the bathroom and online now. :)"
5,It works,"802.11g speeds. well at least faster than my friends 802.11b network. i don't really know how to ""test"" the speed, but i know it works and transfers files faster than my friends 802.11b network. this access point offers some good features, but nothing too spectacular. If you find ti for a good price or you all ready have D-Link products i'd go with this access point. heck even if you don't have d-link products get this. it works with Macs since it doesn't need drivers and it all web based."
1,Broken on the Second Day,What a piece of junk. I should have learned my lesson. Out of the seven Dlink products I bought 4 are broken. Never had this problem with 3com or Netgear. In fact I replaced this unit with Netgear's.
5,ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE,"This has got to be absolutely the best collection of songs from any group in any genre that has ever been compiled. For anyone that is a fan of the Statler Brothers, or just enjoys listening to them from time to time, you NEED this one. This proved to be the best gift my husband ever gave me and it gets listened to 3-4 times a week - I certainly got his money's worth. GET THIS ONE QUICK!"
5,the statler brothers,"I was very,very pleased with the thirty years of the STATLER brothers and the service of getting them.Albert Mason"
3,Awesome!,"Complete collection of the Statler Brothers unique harmonies! I fancy the ""older"" songs, but there are gems in their more recent material, too!Sit back, relax, and enjoy some of the tightest harmonies ever put on a CD!"
5,Statler Brothers,"A good album with a mix of late 60's though to the early 90's.I liked the Statlers hits, but the album ""filler"" songs were frequently some of my favorites."
2,Nothing Special.....,"This review concernes the revised 1973 edition. In this volume, Nancy is asked to solve a case as to where Juliana Johonson, a famous dancer, has disappeared to, so she can collect her inherentince, the Heath Castle, in time. One thing leads to another, and, of course, Nancy saves the day once again, not excepting an offered reward. This, like many of the later re-writes in the 70's, is dull, lifeless, and stale. The writing is bland and there is no charector development whatsover. I have read every yellow-spined Nancy and have to say that about only half the set is any good. If you possibly can, try to read the originals written by Mildred Wirt during the 30's and 40's....the golden-age of Nancy Drew, although (most) of the revised and later ones are not bad (some of them classics), the originals are the best...."
3,"Clue in the Crumbling Wall (Nancy Drew, No 22)","a neat book. i liked it, but there r better Nancy Drew books."
3,Original and Entertaining,"I liked this book a lot. I really did. I thought it was incredibly original and unique. But I have read books where I was so caught up in the story and so in love with the characters that I cried upon finishing them just because there is no more to read. If this tragic ending had happened to characters I felt attached to or involved with, I would have been so moved, but I wasn't. I liked the book, but I didn't ""love"" it. I didn't get involved in it. That's what I look for in a book."
4,Surprising depth in brevity,"I found this book quite short but incredibly rich. After I barreled through the three introductions, I was admittedly not wild about reading a romantic tragedy set in Industrial, rural New England. But every page seem to be alive with Wharton's prose! I would put the book down and suddenly realize how quickly the story was going, how engaging it was, how subtly I was getting sucked in. There were very few ""aha"" moments where I noticed the skill at prose, but whenever I paused from reading I'd realize just how engrossing it had become.This book is just barely over 100 pages, and the entire story takes place in but a few days so it is quite a quick read. I immediately contrasted it with the ubiquitous Romeo-Juliet stories, and found much that was refreshingly different and some that was comfortingly the same. And what a unique take on the ending!This book is great for a rainy day!"
5,Full of mesmerizing images,"A great story of wasted love, compassion, and the eagerness of men to escape from their ""prisons."" Description of the landscape in relation to the mood of every scene is masterful. The unspeakable pain Ethan and Mattie have to suffer is unbearably heart-wrenching. Surprising and revealing ending."
1,Not the best way to spend money,"I read this book because it was recommended to me. I can't imagine why. It has all the emotions of a rock, has no depth, nor did it strike my interest in any way. For nearly the entire book, I found myself criticizing the main characters for their lameness and stupidity. It is now taking up space somewhere in a corner, and will probably remain there until it turns to dust. There was only one good thing about this book: it was short."
1,Reading Ethan Frome has all the pleasures of swallowing a porcupine,"I hate this book more than any other I've read. Edith Wharton indulges herself in a meticulous catalog of imaginary human misery. It is, in it's way, the spiteful grandmother of all the modern fiction that rejoices in the pathetic dysfunction of annoying nobodies. Read it and you have wasted precious hours of your life that you could have spent seeking real joy."
5,American Classic Novella,"Edith Wharton masterfully sketches this tale of Ethan Frome, a turn of the century New England farmer caught in loveless marriage but enthralled with his wife's young cousin who has come to live in his house. A gripping, ironic and tragic tale that holds up well one hundred years after it was written."
4,Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton,"When my english teacher told us we had to read Ethan Frome, I believed that is was going to be boring. To my surprise it was interesting and caught my attention from the start. The book had a surprise ending because Ethan ended up living with both Zeena and Mattie. In the end it was ironic because all three turned into the person they disliked. Ethan became cranky just like Zeena, Mattie became paralyzed which meant she had to depend on someone like Zeena did in the start and Zeena had to take care of Mattie like Mattie took care of her in the start. In concluson I recommend this book to readers who like sad love stories. Another thing I liked about this book is that you could picture this happening to someone in the world or like this situation."
5,I loved it from the beginning,"I don't understand how anyone could have thought that this book was boring. From the minute I picked it up I could not put it down. I too had to read this for English class, but I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. I especially enjoyed the ending. It came as a complete surprise. So if you have not read ""Eathen Frome"" I would definatley recomend it!"
5,Love Is an Obstacle,"A classic tale of love and woe from early in our century. A typical cold, dreary winter in the Northeast is the setting for this tale of twisted emotions and allegiances. Wharton does an excellent job of setting the mood with her apt descriptions of the winter and the characters' moods. The unexpected love discovered by Ethan for Mattie causes his wife to become an obstacle to their happiness. An obstacle he tries to break through as it is symbolized in the tragic turn of events at the end of the novel. This haunting tale of lost love will hang with readers after finishing the novel."
2,A good rural tale,"This is a good book. Not a great one, a good one. It portrays a winter landscape and a small town. Unfortunately, the characters of the small town are flat. The main character is a ponderous middle-aged man who has had an unlucky life. I enjoyed the book, which I read in about 3 hrs. The ending isn't 'enough,' somehow, and I was left feeling like something more had needed to be said. I do intend to read more of Wharton, if only to say that I have."
1,Could it get any worse?,"Many proclaim this novel to be powerful masterpiece about forbidden love, but it was not. Rather it was the lowest possible form of fiction about a man who thinks he is in love, but is not. His life is merely so depressing that he would jump anything that came along. I did not find any value or enjoyment out of this novel what-so-ever, and that is not just me being cruel, because I am trying to be as kind as i possibly can. So if you have time on your hands and you are looking for a good read, I suggest the local phone book would be a viable alternative to the novel Ethan Frome."
5,ETHAN FROME IS A TRAGIC LOVE STORY.,"ETHAN FROME IS A TRAGIC LOVE STORY INVOLVING THREE CHARACTERS. ETHAN, THE MAIN CHARACTER IS MARRIED TO HIS SICK WIFE, ZEENA. WHILE ZEENA IS SICK IN BED HE IS TRYING TO WIN ANOTHER LOVE. TWO OF THESE CHARACTERS, ETHAN AND MATTIE ARE TRYING TO PROVE THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER. WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO PROVE THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER A FATAL ACCIDENT OCCURS AND RUINS EVERYTHING. IN THE END NO ONE IS HAPPY IN THE FROME HOUSEHOLD."
4,I actually enjoyed this book,"In my English class we had just finished reading the book The Scarlet Letter, a so-called classic. Well, when I first picked up this book I thought to myself, not another boring book, but as I began to get into the story I really started to like it. I love the irony of the ending."
2,Stagnant....,"This book is a sad tale of lives gone terribly wrong, and people who had potential but couldn't use it due to illnesses. The unrequited romance between Ethan and Mattie, the sickness of Zeena, the botched suicide attempt, and the life on a cold, unproductive New England farm made the book very very depressing, and overall was a representation of stagnation.A very hard book to get into. I had to read it for school, and found it to be a chore. Despite the tragedies that are otherwise interesting, yet disturbing, Edith Warton unfortunately presents them in a bland, and rather impersonal manner. It has been hailed as a great novel, but I wouldn't call it essential reading."
3,Extremely depressing,"The book is so depressing it makes me retch. Though I must admit it has an interesting theme, as well as a good moral, and Wharton's foreshadowing skills are superb. But this book is still extremely depressing. It is also rather boring at times, and one can find oneself reading the book, yet finding yourself lost, because it became so boring that, even though you were reading it, you weren't taking it in, and when you stared to get back into the book, you found yourself lost, not knowing how far away you were from where you left off. Overall this book loses most of its readers after the first few chapters, and therefore shouldn't be on the top of anyone's list."
4,Entertaining.,"This book had a very good plot. I liked it and reccomend it to anyone. The author writes it with alot of description of the characters and the setting. The story begins with the narrator having to meet Ethan Frome, the main character, by accident. The story then evolves on how Ethan is married to Zeena, but ends up falling in love with Zeena's cousin, Mattie. They try to flee together but both have an accident . Sad ending, but just a well written story that I just loved reading."
3,just not my style...,"this book was ok. there were some parts that I didn't understand what the heck they were talking about and what was going on! If I wasn't reading it for book club, I wouldn't have finished it. It's just not my style of book that I enjoy reading."
3,Ethan Crime,It was a good short read. Good look at the struggle between doing what is right and what we want.
3,Kinda morbid,I was surprised by the ending.I was feeling kinda sorry for Ethan character but wanted him to man up at some point.
5,Ethan frame,Great story from Edith Whorton. A personal tragedy shown from different perspective with an interesting ending. Quite enjoyable even after seeing the movie version.
4,Ethan Frome,A sad winter love story that pits responsibility in a struggle with the hope of true love. A simple story and easy read.
3,Winter Love Story,"This story is the type that you could read when you are bored. ""Ethan Frome"" is intresting and you do get attached to the characters. The story plot is alright, but it could have expanded more. I liked the moral it was trying to teach. I got the idea that the moral of the story was to be careful of who you marry and marry when you are really in love. The ending had alot of irony in it. I mean, Zeena was barely capable of standing her own illness, and than she was left incharge of taking care of both Mattie and Ethan. If Ethan was smarter and would have thought of the situation more throughly, he and Mattie wouldn't end up the way they did. He has always lived a bitter, miserable life, and his actions with Mattie weren't any better. Overall, the story was pretty decent. I did enjoy it some what, but I really didn't like the ending."
3,Ethan Frome,"Ethan Frome is a compelling mysterious tale that takes you back to the days when Ethan Frome was in his early 20's. The book unfolds into a story aimed to explain the cause of a horrific accident. Although this book was captivating, some parts were lacking especially the ending."
1,Hilarious,This book is tremendously [bad]. The main character is whiney and unintersting and for some reason Wharton expects us to care about what happens to these whiney self indulgent charaacters. Rediculous. There is no pain except the unnecesary pain the caharcters put on themselves because they are so bored they have nothing better to do. New Englend must be awful.The ending with the sled has to be the most triumphant and undoubtedly funny scenes in all of literature. I personally cheered and laughed out loud. Unfortunatly Wharton wrote it with a straigt face intending none of the humor that is there.
2,Sucks,"I love Edith Wharton's work. I read it mostly for the mellifluous prose. This book, however, is dull in every sense. The prose are flat and spare. The story is flat and spare. And I hate it. It was boring. Usually her stories are engaging, interesting, and hard to put down. I knew when I bought this book it would be bad. I asked myself, ""What the hell does Edith Wharton know about indigent peasants?"" And after reading ""Ethan Frome"" I realized she knew nothing! Stick to the glittering affluent New York life that you knew and were a part of. I admire Edith Wharton's attempt to branch out and I'm sure she meant every word she wrote (since apparently her own marriage was falling apart), but the book is still boring. Read any other book by her, especially The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth."
1,Very slow and boring...,"This is probably the worst book I have ever read (in terms of entertainment, I'm sure it might have some good lessons, but what's the point if you don't want to read the book?) I could not even finish it because it was so bad. Slow, depressing, and boring."
1,Just plain awful,"I was required to read this book in an English class, almost back-to-back with the Crucible and the Scarlet Letter. Depressing reading about repressed people -- run if you can!"
1,Ethan Frome,I believe this is one of if not the worst book ever writen. The stroy goes no where. It is the story of a sad man that does not teach us any thing useful. I believe the only reason someone should read this book is because the have to. If given a choice i would have picke any other book. Unargueably the worst book ever
1,Waiting for the appeal... still waiting...,"This book was indeed a short tale, but it was possibly the worst book I have ever read. There's nothing appealing about it at all. I was forced to read this for my English class, and that was the only reason I even finished it. I kept expecting it to get better. I was mistaken. This is definitely Wharton's weak point. There was no real story to this book. If you enjoy short, meaningless, redundant tales than you will like this book. No offense to the countless others who like this book; I guess I'm missing the appeal! DON'T READ."
1,"If I believed in burning books, this would be the only one I'd torch","This stands as the longest work of ""literature"" I have ever been forced to read. Not due to the page count, as it is actually rather (mercifully) short; it is merely the most monotonous and plodding work of fiction ever published, in any language. When I read the book, I had hoped for a punchline - at some point the story would actually take form and progress. Instead, I felt as though I had been accosted by one of those people who insist on showing you their boils and bunions while you are trying to eat your lunch. Its only merit is that it is a prime example of what aspiring writers should NEVER produce. If this book were distributed in Guantanamo, Amnesty International would object, and rightly so. This is the pinnacle of academic torture, and those who assign it should be investigated, very closely."
4,What does the red pickle dish symbolize,"Hi my name is J.T. I'm currently a freshman in high school.I began reading a little more this year, not only because I have for English class but for my own enjoyment and pleasure. About a week ago I started to read Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. My teacher said that this has been a book that has read for many years even when she was in high school. Let me tell you this was a very book but what I didnt understand is what the red pickle dish symbolized.I will remember through high school and I hope to purchase this book as soon as possible. If you have read this book and would like to fill me in please do and e-mail me at jet396@hotmail.com"
2,Rosebud does them in,"Plowing through this novel was as arduous and monotonous as the long snowy carriage rides from Ethan's homestead to the town of Starkfield. Did I just complete a grueling meditation retreat? It was mercifully short, though, not even 140 pages, and it does offer glimmers of intellectual satisfaction amidst the text's long zazen session. Most of the character descriptions pop off the page with vividness. Mattie's way of ""throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out"" was pure literary gold, and the various ponderous descriptions of Ethan's countenance, that he had a ""moral isolation too remote for casual access"" and could feel ""huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things"" served as charitable descriptions of a man with Job-like tragedy in his life. Overall, if you are budgeting just one Edith Wharton novel for your reading list, I wouldn't choose Ethan Frome."
3,"Eh, not too good. But not horrible","Ethan Frome was well written with some great symbolism, but didn't really have much of a story. This book could have been summed up in 20 pages. It had this little story that was stretched out for about 200 pages, which made it really boring. It goes by really slow with little going on. ""The House of Mirth"" by Edith Wharton is much better. If you're going to read one of her books, you should read that over ""Ethan Frome""."
1,Dull and pointless,"Stupid book. They call it a 'classic'. Classic, in that it is the slowest and most pointless book ever! A guy thinks he loves his cousin but he doesn't. So what. I only read it because I had to pass English class."
1,Remember the story about....,"Have you ever read the story about the girl who was dancing at a ball with a prince when a clock struck twelve and she had to hurry off and lost her slipper? And then the prince found it and found her and they lived happily ever after? The story of Ethan Frome was nothing like that. It's a very sad and depressing story. I read it for an English class and--well its just hard to describe. The author's writing cast a dark, bleak shadow on the story. I hated Mattie, I hated Ethan and I really hated Zeena."
2,Still depressing; now made even WORSE through an introduction by Elizabeth Ammons,"The best part of this edition is the cover illustrator. Jeffrey Brown deserves more attention -- the illustrations were great.Elizabeth Ammons took a straightfoward story and post-neo-racia-femini-homo-colonia-hegemoni-classstruggled it in her introductory notes. This is what passes for scholarship? Good grief. This book is not so difficult to understand, that she had to decide that race underscores the whole thing. And Toni Morrison as an expert opinion leader? I'm insulted, but I'm not surprised.Last, one would think in a world where Howard Zinn's corrupt scholarship has been so thoroughly discredited, that scholars would be reluctant to cite him so prominently in their work. Seems reckless.Edith Wharton wrote about what she knew: misery and lost chances. That's Ethan Frome. It becomes all the more poignant and painful to read it as an adult -- but good literature does that. It grows on you."
1,Not Suggested for the Clinically Depressed,"And if you're not currently among the ranks of the depressed, you will be after reading this novel. Seriously, I did not find the novel either a) beautiful or b) worth reading. Perhaps it would have been very moving in a tragic sense if I had bought any of Wharton's feeble attempts at painting a story of forbidden love gone wrong. The novel entirely lacked any real connection with human emotions and behaviors. Perhaps, if the storyline of the book were my life, it would depress me very much. The pointlessness and ironic misfortune of these characters lives is remarkable, but I was left feeling too apathetic to be upset by this fact. I do not suggest you torture yourself by reading this novel, unless you have a flair for masochism."
2,Nothing happened,This book was the most uneventful book I have ever read. I kept waiting for a big scene or something interesting to happen. The only halfway interesting thing happened at the very end and it wasnt even that good. I don't know how this book became a classic. I do not recommend this book to anyone. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because it was easy to follow and it only took me one day. I didn't waste anymore of my life reading this book.
1,Don't waste 3 hours of lifespan reading this book,"This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering ""why?"" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some ""excitement"" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting. To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY????"
1,Depressing,"This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable."
2,CM says: YAWN...-A dull book that fails to interest,"For a person who desires excitement, this book fails to give any. Set in the remote countryside of western Massachusetts, Ethan Frome explores the effects of isolation from society and social settings in general. Ethan Frome struggles to decide whether to stay with his bland wife or leave with the younger Mattie. In the end, all that Ethan Frome amounts to is a sappy soap opera that ends with a failed suicide attempt. An utterly boring book that I found hard to get through."
3,A tragic love ruined by a controlling wife.,"The book, Ethan Frome, was good. Ethan Frome's mother was sick so Zenobia, aka Zeena, took care of her up to her death. His mom died in the winter and then he married Zeena. Their marriage wasn't based on love for each other which leads Ethan to falling in love with Mattie, Zeena's cousin, when she comes to help the Frome's because Zeena gets sick. Zeena's controlling ways slowly kills Ethan."
3,I wouldn't recommend it,"This is one of those books which I read and thinking it was a piece of literary history, but extremely boring. It's a book where the story is unexciting and unappealing, but the point it conveys is important."
3,That's it?,"I was assigned this book for my junior American Lit class. When I recieved it, I thought, crud. I have to read this whole stupid story about a gimpy man and his crabby wife. However, once I slogged through the introduction, I was captivated. I read the whole book the first night I had it. I just had to find out what happened to Ethan and Mattie! The personalities and settings were so vivid, it drew me right in. Then I got to the end. Boo. I'm not giving it away, but all I could say was, THAT'S IT?"
3,"Cold climate, cold story","This is really a novella. Short. Astute. Cold and clear as a winter's nights.As a precursor to our New England Road Trip, it didn't exactly instil a sense of ""can't wait to get there""! (Plan to visit The Mount in Lenox, MA, home of, and designed by, Wharton.)The setting is Starkfield ... perfectly named. While the village, its inhabitants and community life had rustic appeal, the weather was bleak, as were the central characters ... a whining and manipulative ""sickly"" wife, a forlorn hard-done-by young girl, and a tormented unfulfilled husband. The story is depressing ... exactly what the pitch and timbre of the writing aims for. A perfectly painted and perfectly executed melodrama ... a good read, but not a joy to read!First woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1921 (The Age of Innocence)"
5,Digital copy,This digital copy of Ethan Frome is fine. It's the first digital novel I've tried to use. The service from Amazon Kindle is useful and accessible.
4,Ethan Frome Reveiw,"This is a very short and plesureable read, I was gripped intenetly by the twisted love story that lies beneath. Ethan's love for Maddie is contently shown through his thoughts and actions. This book is great for anyone that likes challanging literature but dosn't want to read a boring lifeless book. Maddie's character is mysterious and it build's your suspense as you get through the novel.I would recommend this book for any strong reader ages 12 and up."
1,Wharton gets her point across,"If I were to use four words to review this book, they would be: ""thank goodness it's over"". I did not enjoy this book at all. With her tale of loneliness and a tragic ""lovers' pact"" set in the cold and unforgiving New England snow, Edith Wharton attempts to draw us, the readers, into the black pit of despair known as her life. She succeeds marvelously. _Ethan Frome_ is a prime example of how literature can effectively evoke emotion. Wharton was an unhappy woman, and while reading her book, I was unhappy as well. Even though his story is tragic, one cannot sympathize with Frome; he has suffered for most of his life and will continue to suffer for the rest of his life, but his own choices took him there. I recommend staying very far away from this novella."
1,Ugh.,Stupid book. I had to read it for ap English in school. & I'm just glad that it didn't cost me anything
3,A Love/Hate Relationship,"I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I really liked Mattie's character and sometimes I liked Ethan's character as well. However I couldn't help but notice that Ethan isn't a real man. What man would let his wife make life changing decisions without him? Especially if her choice really didn't sit well with him? If I had been Mattie I would have dumped Mr. Frome for a real man. Of all the low, cowardly, spineless people I have ever read about Ethan's character reigns supreme. However the second to last Chapter (when Mattie and Ethan talk about their love for one another) made me cry. A book had never made me cry before and I never understood people who cried over books. But this book made me cry. However the end was horrible! I didn't expect a happy ending, but I mean come on! I don't want to spoil the book so I won't talk about it but geez! What a way to end a book!"
2,Ethan Frome,"Ok... I picked up this book for my english class mainly because my sister said is was good. To my disdain, I found it be rather dull. Ethan Frome is no more the a love sick man who can't live with his life as it was. I thought that this book was boring and I could have slept through it. The best part is that Ethan and Mattie got what they deserved at the end of the bookI would recommend this book to anyone who likes the romantic-type novels."
2,Depressing...,"For starters, nothing good happens in this book. Why is it that books assigned to schoolkids (statistically the most likely to commit suicide and suffer from depression) are usually relentlessly depressing? I found this novel extremely hard to get through, not just because of its dark subject matter but because I wanted to run, screaming, from these characters and the setting.BTW, I also hated the Great Gatsby, so there.I give it two stars because the quality of the writing is pretty high, but this is a book few (sadists?) would read for enjoyment."
2,Boring......,If u enjoy reading tragic love stories then this is the book for you! This book bored me to death. It might be short but it takes forever to read! I rate this book two because it didn't go anywhere. It only took place at the farm and had only three characters. And what the heck was the pickle dish? The good thing about this book was the imagery. It is very descriptive.
1,The WORST book in the history of ink!!!,... Ethan Frome is a worm with no backbone who was afraid to stand up to his overbearing wife. Period!! The story is irrelevant to life in the 21st century. If you are unhappy in a marriage you'd get a divorce. ... This is one book that actually DISCOURAGES people from reading. After reading this piece of garbage you'll wish you were illiterate!!.
3,Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton,"In the snowy town of Starkfield, Massachusetts, live Ethan Frome and his wife, Zeena. While Zeena is ill-stricken, Ethan finds comfort and friendship in their housekeeper, young Mattie Silver. The book portrays poverty and dull routine, the claustophobia of village life, lack of communication, and illicit love as its major themes. Edith Wharton uses the sense of fatality as the major case of symbolism. She writes of winter dreariness, the bareness of the Frome farmhouse, and the insufficiency of Ethan's sawmill to properly portray her thoughts. If you enjoy reading about forbidden love, such as Romeo and Juliet, then Ethan Frome is for you. However, be careful, because the use of British language can make it tough to read if you don't have an open mind, or if you're looking for something not-so-serious."
4,Passion,"I am fascinated by the way the author portrays Ethan Frome. She begins the novel from the view of a visitor to the little town of Starkfield. This visitor is intrigued by the solemn, crippled man and gradually learns more of his life story. Ethan had previosuly married Zeena out of pure desperation for a human companion. Their marriage quickly turns stale. When Mattie comes to work as a housemaid, Ethan grows to love her upbeat spirit and cheerful attitude. He is then torn between loyalty to his wife and his love for Mattie. Zeena banishes Mattie from their home, causing Ethan to struggle with the decision whether to run away with her or not. This book clearly shows the importance of love. It was a fairly easy read, and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Unexpected ending makes the novel!,Ethan Frome was an awesome book! I FELT SO BAD FOR ETHAN! He was such a sweet guy and he could not change any of the horrible circumtances that his life brought him. I loved Mattie and I think that she deserved a better life than what she ended up with. Wharton describes these characters so well that at the end of the novel I felt that I knew Ethan and Mattie for years. I knew that Zeena was a hypocondriac from the begining of the novel and I did not like her shallow attempt for the attention of all those who knew her. Overall this book is really good because it is concise and has an unexpecting ending.
2,The Boring Book,This book was pretty short. I didn't really like it. It was confusing and I didn't understand most of it.
2,I don't like it and was forced to read it!!,Book was pretty bad. Boring and just couldn't get into it. I was happy when it was over! Really don't recommend this book to anyone! Sorry...
5,a beautifully written short novel,"Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. Published by MobileReference (mobi).Superbly written, Ethan Frome is almost realistic American fiction at its finest. Five stars!"
4,"Et tu, Zenobia?...then sled Ethan!","Bleak, haunting, heartbreaking. Short and pithy, impossible to forget, probably a bit advanced for the high school crowd, but they need every chance they can get to escape from their rap music and video games. Read the book because it is the real deal, and the ""Ethan"" movie was a stinker on so many levels. Actually some material in here may be appropriate for high schoolers after all, because the novel contains some messages about the de-romanticizing of suicide attempts, and a sotto voce warning that the person you marry in haste might turn out to be someone different than you thought..."
4,"""Garbo talks."" In essence, a Eugene O'Neil play.","This film is the great Eugene O'Neil in all his dark glory. Moody, dark, slow-paced, and bearing his intense psychology, it is not a film for all audiences or tastes. In addition to the great Garbo, is a magnificent perfomance by the silent film legend Marie Dressler. Before her death, she would make 3 classics with Wallace Beery, one of which was FDR's favorite film of all time: ""Tugboat Annie."" Her banter with Jean Harlow in ""Dinner at Eight,"" was peerless and hysterical.This film is a one of those ""transition"" pieces from the silent to the talking era, and as such, carries aspects of both periods.Well worth seeing and having in one's collection."
1,Dreadful,"If you are looking for PIANO versions of these songs, DO NOT BUY THIS COLLECTION! Sure the songs have piano, but also drums, saxophone, violins, - an entire orchestra! The point is, this is not just piano. The title is misleading. Another thing I do not like about the songs is they are highly ""stylized"". If you want simple, straight-forward, traditional versions of these songs, this set is not for you. I do not recommend this set."
2,"Unfortunately, a dull read","After the riveting ""All the President's Men,"" one would expect that when Bob Woodward sharpened his journalistic pencil to take after the Supreme Court that more fun would follow. Alas, it is not to be. ""The Brethren"" is a fairly conventional by-the-numbers account of the Nixon-Ford era Supreme Court that tries to drum up tension from such incidents as the movement to impeach the aged Justice William O. Douglas, but ultimately fails. The secretive world of the court would be difficult for any journalist to penetrate, and here Woodward and his cohort Armstrong prove themselves not to be up to the task.A word about this book's availability. I frequent a lot of used book stores and I've come across it on a regular basis."
1,The most boring book I've ever come across.,This book is the most repugnant book in the world. I would rather eat a live rat than have to read it again. Thankfully I read it for a grade. I fear anyone who actually wants to read this book.
3,"Interesting, but lacking","I was very much looking forward to reading this book. But I must say that from the first chapter I was disappointed with the writing. The book reads like a string of unrelated newspaper articles or diary entries. There is no underling arc that ties all of the little stories together.However, despite this shortcoming, ""The Brethen"" is very interesting. Woodward and Armstrong provide a unique take on the inner-workings of the first few years of the Burger court.I would suggest that anyone considering reading ""The Brethen"" instead consider ""Closed Chambers: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court"" by Edward Lazarus."
5,"Fascinating, Intriguing & Descriptive",This book is as much a snap-shot view of the Supreme Court as it is a detailed view of the characters serving the Court during that period. Often the latter material provides the entertainment insofar as the time period provides the circumstances. A thoroughly enjoyable read!
4,Great Read!!,"This book absolutely flew past. It could easily have been fiction. I read it during the summer before I started law school, and I find myself thinking of it with some regularity two years later. It includes small details of the workings of the court that are absolutely fascinating, and the historical time period is more relevant today than ever."
4,Insightful,"Here we have an unflattering, behind-the-scenes look at the U.S. Supreme Court. Discloses the intrigues, jealousies, ill humor, and combat between justices and describes the debates and tactics that produced many of the Court's major rulings between 1969 and 1976. I found the book easy to read and illuminating. Just goes to remind you that no matter what position you obtain, people cannot escape their own bias."
4,Nice little phone,"I bought the V191 unlocked quad band phone because it had the features I wanted, seemed well made and was offered at a reasonable price. It is one of the few phones left on the market without one of those dumb, little built-in cameras. I wanted minimal crap. The phone met my expectations. But the instruction book came in Japanese only. With a bit of help from the store, I found an English translation on line. All is well."
1,not worth the trouble,"text message does not work, directions in a language I can't even identify, contact with ace photo, the vendor, was unproductive. not a good purchase experience at all."
3,Great Phone ... No Text Messages,"I think this is a great phone. I bought it to have a GSM phone in Peru and it worked great. Good signal strength. Good sound quality. The battery seems to last forever. For voice, I couldn't be happier with this little phone.However ... I echo the other reviewer's complaint that text messaging does not work. I spent hours in Peru trying to make it work. I returned to the USA and found the English language manual online and looked up text messaging. The manual says it exists, but the relevant menu option never appears on the phone. This wouldn't be so much of a problem for me except, in Peru at least, it is necessary to use text messaging to find out how much money is left on the prepaid SIM card. We had to keep moving the SIM card into our ultra-cheap Peruvian phone to send a text message, which was a pain."
5,Stikfas Tan Review,"Great toys, I have a big Army of Black's Green's and now finally Tans!.I love these little guys, There so much fun, and the weird thing is, they dont actually DO anything. there just a super poseable action figure, What every boy (or girl, my 2 little sisters love em) wanted when they played with little green army men, Ones that moved and had an arsenal of guns!Good job! Just dont loose the edge and get too big for your boots! There making a lot of variants and I think it could get silly, Mabey an accessory kit for them with new guns and things? like a rope and a hook etc etc??just a thought."
4,A furturistic novel and spiritual teaching manual,"There are several levels to this book, and many obscure threads which are woven together to make a very satisfying, yet provocative and obtuse novel of survival in times of chaos as society falls apart. Some of the mysteries which are present in the story ( who really is Emily, who and/or what is the dog, what is the alternate reality behind the wall, and what are all the charactors doing at the end when the iron egg crumbles) are woven into other novels by Lessing, such as the ""Four Gated City."" ""Memoirs of a Survivor"" is reported to be partly autobiographical.A movie was made in England of ""Memoirs"" staring Julie Christi around 1985 which was shown briefly in Venice, California. I have not seen it referred to anywhere since."
2,a post-apocalyptic yawner,"Despite the author's accomplished prose style and vivid imagination, this is, in the end, a very boring book about a setting and a theme which should be fascinating: surviving the--or at least an--apocalypse. The problem is that the author remains at such an abstract and intellectual level throughout most of the book. As a result, you don't fully enter into the narrator's world, and you don't really get to know the characters. There is a scene about 30 pages from the end, when some peddlers come selling water in buckets, and there's a fight over the water, when I found myself saying, ""Yes--this is exactly the kind of engaging detail that has been missing from most of this story!"" The ambiguities of the cat-dog character and the wall-as-conduit-to-alternate-reality do not make up for this fundamental shortcoming."
3,enjoyable fix for PA lovers,"My suggestion is to take this book at face value - a tale of a woman and her child trying to survive in an increasingly hard world. I didn't love it but there were aspects that still linger in my memory where other books have faded completely. If you are desperate for a PA fix, this will do in a crunch."
2,I tried hard but I failed,"It may not be fair for me to rate this book as I was not able to finish it. I even thought of just deleting it from my book list - that's how I don't like it. Tried to read it at different times of the day but I can't help but fall asleep over it, every time! Much as I hate to leave a book unfinished, this isn't just worth my time and effort. I won't mind if people will think of me as shallow, but in my opinion, deep subjects such as the one tackled in this book can be presented in a more interesting and engaging manner. Doesn't matter if she's a Nobel Prize winner, if this is her style, I don't think we'll ever click."
3,"Really ""Lost"" Voyage","I happen to like ghost ship movies, too. I saw this and decided to get it. Others here have described the plot, so I won't go into that. I found though that the plot was rather wobbly at best. Unlike ""Ghost Ship"", where we know the souls are trapped onboard and that there's an evil force that wants to add the heroes to the deceased passenger list, here we have no idea what exactly is taking shots at our intrepid adventurers. In ""Ghost Ship"", those who were taken in by the allure of illicit gold lost their souls. Here there's no criteria. There are times it seems like it's ready to take off, only to sink (pun intended) back into a mediocre plot. I didn't mind the ending, although it's just as unbalanced as the rest of the story."
1,So bad it's funny,"Ok, I had high hopes for this flick, but I was very let down. Judd Nelson is pathetically unbelievable. His acting is horrible compared to his performance in ""Breakfast Club"", which says a lot. Lance Henrikson does a fair job, and his character is somewhat convincing, but any role the man portrays screams ""Millennium"" (former TV show). The DVD itself has no special features that would set it apart from a VHS copy, save the digital audio track. The only reason to watch this movie to show your friends that, although ""Freddy Got Fingered"" really is the worst movie ever, you've found a serious contender for a 2nd place finishing."
1,WOW....Was this bad !!!!,"I must say I'm glad I didn't pay much for this. As a fan of Judd Nelson's work I took a chance and have regretted it ever since. (Though probably not as much as Nelson) Not even Judd could save this wreck of a movie. The special effects are the ONLY thing going for it and even they weren't all that special. The acting is pathetic and the writing is even worse. Oh, and did I mention the story? I cannot believe the folks at UFO and City Heat Productions funded the making of this masacre. I also can't believe they suckered Nelson and Lance Henrikson(Aliens) into making it. My guess is both actors lost a bet! Please, do yourself a favor and pass on this one!"
1,"Ghost Ship without the writing, acting, or special effects",What a horrible movie. No redeeming value whatsoever. This movie is what happens when all of the budget goes to CGI special effects (and they ain't that great) and none is spent on writing or editing.
2,On the plus side...,"On the plus side, these tub toys are hard plastic with no holes so they float all of the time and don't fill up with nasty mildew water. My 15 month old constantly chews on them and the paint has yet to chip off. The bad thing about this toy is it does not stack up (as shown in the advertisement) making them a little frustrating for my daughter to play with, and in my opinion aren't really worth $6.00."
3,they dont stay but,they dont stay on top long enough for child to get a chance to enjoy ther accoplishment of building a tower but they are great bath toys and very cute
5,A must have!,"This book is a must have for anyone in project management. It is easy to understand, presented well, and will benefit people of all experience levels. Greg clearly knows what he is talking about and should be teaching courses on project management. I only wish I had this book when I was in that business!"
4,Project Management Basics - easy to read and understand,"I bought that book for my college class which is an introductory class to project management. The book is very easy to read, you finish a chapter in no time. I think it gives you a good first impression about the topics that are relevant in that field but it's still only an introduction. It's really simple and most things seem pretty trivial to you. However, the author seems to really identify with the reader, he doesn't lecture and doesn't stick to technical terms but makes it fun to read. If you're looking for a book that will give you only a sense / an idea about what project management is like; buy this one. However if you're looking for something more substantial, you might reconsider buying it."
5,A great book to understand the basics of project management,I found this to be a great book to share with new employees to help them understand the basics in project management and allow them to begin to understand and utilize the PMI terminology.
2,Good reference text but minimal groundbreaking value,"I would recommend this book only to someone with no prior professional experience, entering the world of employment. The author assumes the reader has a complete lack of prior knowledge of any project management skills. It could be a good reference guide to someone with the project management duties but without the formal PM title. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone with more than two years professional experience.It seems to be written for a high school level education, which has advantages and disadvantages: it is easily digestable and a quick read but sometimes risks presenting the material in an overly simplistic description.While it provides a thorough introduction to the concepts of project management in a cookbook style, it does not provide adequate background on the soft skills, political savvy, and negotiation skills required of a project manager to resolve conflicts."
3,Basic Knowledge,"I found this book to provide a sound basic understanding of the ins and outs of Project Management. I particularly liked the ""Tips"" and the checklists. I would recommend this book for those who need to gain insight into the details of Project Management."
5,Street Sign,I bought this for a gag gift and was very impressed with how professional the quality of the sign is. You would certainly think this is a REAL parking sign.
2,She needs to get a job,"This book is complete garbage, made by a woman who has too much time on her hands and not enough talent in her head. Reverend Jen is supported by her rich, suburban (Maryland) parents and, unlike most of you reading this, will never need to get a job. Instead, she has the luxury to ""slum"" it out in the LES, surround herself with supportive nimrods, and crank out moronic drivel. It's easy to knock hardworking people and mock society when you are a kept bird who never has to roll out of bed before noon."
1,BE A BUBBLEBRAIN-WEAR THIS!,"Che was nothing other than a self absorbed communist who used the safety, and desperation, of people to serve his self absorbed existance, all while using the people's welfare to serve himself! Look as stupid as he was, and wear his propganda it'll keep your empty skull from getting chilly!"
1,Thugly,"Be sure to wear this Beanie with picture of a murderous sociopath ideologue on it to loudly proclaim your ignorance of ""history"" and the complete absence of grey matter in your cranium."
1,Camera case,"I just ordered the Fujifilm SC-FXA3-US Deluxe Padded soft case for my camera. It was only $.50 cents but I was astounded to learn the shipping cost was $13.00.How can this be permitted? I work for the Postal Service and know our rates are the cheapest of all the competitors and would not cost $13.00 with anyone to mail, except for overnight delivery."
2,not pleased,"although the main part of the case in which my camera resides is useful, I was dismayed when I received it as the strap had one clip broken and the first time I opened and closed the additional pocket, the zipper broke. The only reason I have not returned it for a new one is that the cost of shipping would make it too expensive."
2,Flimsy Build,"Well, I guess you get what you pay for. Threads are constantly coming out of this. It's falling apart fairly quickly. I can't complain too much because it was so cheap.With that said it does seem to be padded enough to protect the camera."
1,do not buy it,drive your car go to any supermarket.Spend same amount of money you can get much better stuff!
2,Mark De Clive-Lowe - Tide's Arising,"I was introduced to Mark De Clive-Lowe through his Shirley Horne remix on the first _Verve Remixed_ album, and I was eager to hear his own work. And while _Tide's Arising_ has a polished sheen to it, I was slightly disappointed. Certainly, the broken beats on the album are crisp and quick and the production quality is strong, but I don't feel he's breaking much new ground here. The rapid fire vocals on ""Traveling"" and ""State of the Mental"" sound too similar; the grindy R&B on ""Quintessential"" and ""Heaven"" pleasantly fall by the wayside. As well, some of the shorter instrumentals sound too contemporary adult (""Pino + Mashi,"" ""Masina's World""). The staccato flavors of ""Syndrome,"" however, do help set that track apart, but I'm afraid the listener's interest is too apt to come and go like the tide."
5,ease of use and reliability,"I found the Wahl custon shaver to be an excellent buy and very reliable electric shaver. I have owned and used a Whal shaver for over 20 years and love them. The new 5000 electric shaver is a new design that tells you how many shaves you have left on a charge with a number of small led lights that light up and indicate the charge left. Th electric shaver can be charged on 110 volts or 220 volts, making it making it ideal traveling abroad. This new Whal 5000 is the best electric shaver I have ever owned!! BOB"
4,wahl electric shaver 5000,I received the shaver in timely fashion and it was exactly as described.The price was excellent for this product and the perfomance was as good as I had expected. Amazon is a superb merchant not only for books but for varied merchandice as well.I am extremely pleased with amazon and I will continue to use their services for my future needs.
5,Miss These Guys,"I actually had already bought this album upon it's release but when I moved across the country, I took the CD case but the CD was no where to be found. Four years later, I went to visit my mother and went through all my old things and still came up empty handed. This was a hard album to find online for a while since they only ever released the one album but I finally bought myself another copy. I really miss this band because they were great and very promising."
4,"Wow, Rockin' CD!","Definitely high energy, modern rock with a tight beat. This CD is worth buying just for the tune: ""Mono Baby"" alone. My other favorite is ""Last Wish"" with ""Pain"" a close third. There isn't a bad song on this album. Take my word for it. Check out the CD, and go see the live shows when they visit your town!"
3,What the crap?,"I ordered four of these for the family to play on trips. I was really excited about the retro feel of these bingo cards. When the arrived, I was pretty disappointed. Not only are they very flimsy and not very durable feeling (cardboard) but the seller shipped four of the same cards! The cards were sold as individual items, four different colors were advertised; however, I received four blue ones that only had two different versions of images. So, basically only two people can play at one time because what fun is bingo if you know there will always be two winners? Am I making my gripe clear here? Not sure that I am.Cut and dry is that the product isn't worth the four dollars a piece I spent on them AND the seller had no courtesy for the customer since I was sent something that isn't logical to use. Why on earth would you buy four cards and want ANY duplicates, let alone duplicates of two of them."
4,Childhood memories!,"I recently sought these out as a gift for a friend on a cross-country car trip with his kids. We used to play this for hours as kids. He loved it, as it brought back childhood memories for him as well. And the kids had a ball with them. These are the original cards that are exactly how we remembered them. Recommended!"
2,Some items are impossible to find in the suburbs,"My DH found one of these cards at a local retailer. They had just one left. Too bad DH didn't look closer at the items on the card. It's impossible to get a bingo in any direction with the card we have, living in the suburbs as we do. They have things like Silo, Tractor, Haystack. Yeah, right. None of those around here. It makes for a very frustrated kid. This wasn't as good of an idea as DH thought."
4,Bingo,"I had a very old bingo card my children use to play ( all in there 30's now) got the address & ordered more cards for my grandchildren. A friendly sales person took my order & got my order very fast. I was impressed! My grandkids love this game! Not only do they get competitive but it's a learning tool. I am very happy with this product & will order more I'm sure. Didn't you have one that had animals (cows, dogs etc?)"
4,Fun and entertaining for a road trip,I loved these as a child so I purchased them for my children before we took a LONG road trip. Fun and entertaining. Even my 2 year old had fun sliding the little covers back and forth. We'll be using these for years.
4,An Overlooked Gem,"My husband had been telling me about this movie for years. Most of the lead actors have unfortunately passed away. A very young Denzel has a small, but pivotal role. This is a great movie."
5,An Amazing African American Classic!,Adolph Ceaser was absolutely at his best in this flick. Great story. Denzel along with the other castmates were superb. Great military drama! A must for collectors of African American film.
5,Have Been Looking for this movie,I love this movie and have been looking for it for quite a while. I got it at a great price and I also received it very fast!!
2,Unfortunately the movie is rather dull despite good acting,"I honestly wanted to like this movie. I truly did. But I found it terribly dull. A military movie should have some action. Instead, the movie tended to drag and I was barely able to pay attention half the time because I started to lose interest. The actors are great, but something was definitely missing. It's unfortunate."
3,long and slow,"Probably not a BAD movie but JFC did it drag.The whole movie seemed to be more interested in how bad the blacks were treated than actually telling the story, WHICH would have made the point much better.3 stars is probably generous but the movie it IS better than 2 stars.Some stand out acting by the cast although the white characters were a little to stereotyped"
5,All the twists and turns of a good murder mystery,This is one of the best murder mystery movies in years. It is superbly acted and directed. It appeals to all ages and the base depiction and military politics are all wonderful. Why is it that this movie is unavailable at most major video rental outlets??? Amazes me...
5,A phenomenal Cast,"This movie will be listed as an all time great.I can usually predict who the killer is before the movie ends...But not this time.Every time I watch it I always end up saying "" I didnt know he/she was in the movie.I think Pattie LaBelle did a great job, the short time she was in the movie.I dont write reviews unless a movie is really bad or one you should add to your collection . This is one you NEED to add to your collection."
5,GREAT MOVIE,Great Movie. Bought it to add to my collection. This movie is an absolute classic. Worth purchasing. So many stars in this movie. Another chance to see Denzel as a bad guy. He was great along with Howard Rollins and Aldolph Caesar.
5,Strangely impressive,"One of prettiest histories of love and faith, that I have ever seen in my entire life. Strangely impressive it is indispensable to any person who thinks about love. A gorgeous film with a gorgeous girl."
3,Better off reading the book,"The book by Max Frisch (Homo Faber), latin for ""Man the Maker"", is the way to go here. Frisch was an existentialist, not a Buddhist, as someone earlier asserted. It is the story of modern man who believes in instrumental reason and has trouble with romantic or subjective feelings. Great book that can't really be made into an effective movie."
4,Greek Tragedy,"I have not read the original book but plan to after viewing this a couple of years ago. The vision of this film is not exactly brilliant yet that's the plot and story attract the most.There is an underlying sense of Greek-tragedy-like story. If you like Oedipus the Rex and greek drama, you will find this one entralling. It makes you sad yet there is nothing you can do about.What the pity is this film has been neglected when it was first released."
3,sesame sidekick potty,"This is fine except a little small for my now three year old grandson...needs more of a ""front guard""!"
2,doesn't work for boys...,"the seat is made for girls obviously, as there is a large gap for the pee shield to slide into the front of the seat, but it's so large, when a boy pees, it gets stuck in the gap and you have to wash the seat out every time, defeating the purpose of them learning to do it on their own. and after only a month of use, the vinyl is starting to crack on the edge, making my son nervous to sit on that part. also, after having to rinse it off on a regular basis, it looks as if the cartoon print is wearing off. overall, quite disappointing."
1,"Be VERY, VERY careful with this seat","We used this seat to train our son. While he loved it because he got to sit on the 'big' potty, it created a ratehr harrowing event. His 'winky' got caught on little plastic spray guard and caused a 3/4"" cut around the shaft. Although there was no permanent damage, there was a ton of blood and it was terrifying for all of us.I recommend finding a seat that has no sharp edges where little parts can get caught."
3,John Jay Harper revealed,"In 1990, John Jay Harper had an experience that he describes as being ""suddenly and completely raptured in the Sun of God...my third eye had opened spontaneously...thoughts were thinking me."" Here he discusses the science behind superconsciousness with Reality Films trademark music and colorful graphic images."
5,Beware of False Prophets,"But this isn't one of them. Harper enlightens and unravels the 2012 enigma like no other. Great narration and direction, great script, wonderful music, a joy to behold in these times of wonder."
2,Return of the Serpent?,"""WE are the words of the sun gods made flesh."" We are all becoming a Christ. Reminds me of something spoken by a serpent I read about in Genesis. Personally, I don't believe we are all gods.I also don't believe we have all been reincarnated, as is stated in this movie.I realize there are some out there who agree with the viewpoint of this video, which is their perrogative, but I am not one of them.This presentation was boring, interspersed with interesting tidbits. The music was a distraction, mainly, and the one speaking voice in the movie was enough to put someone to sleep.Don't be fooled by an interesting title. It's not worth it, even if you agree with the points stated in the video as truth."
1,Very Dissapointing - Aweful Produced,Don't buy this DVD. It's cheap produced and has no value at all. The company even refuses to take back the product.
1,2012 I Hope Its Over !!!,PRETTY SORRY ! Not a dvd for documentary viewers. It was a sound and graphic display with meaningless new age dribble laced throughout.
1,lack of WISDOM,"So in 2012, can we all expect a mass variety of Heaven Gate Suicides?People Get real, look up Issacc Newtons Studies- I would trust him more than the mayansAnd besides if all these Occult Leaders possessed the so called truth, why did they all end in DOOM and literally destroyed? Why didn't their inner knowledge SAVE them?Far as the snake goes in the Garden of Eden , well when you have given childbirth, you know the serpent was lying to Eve.Only one God folks, and with out him we are nothing!"
1,Frustrating,"The narration would have made a great magazine article. There was a pretty good amount of information in the script. As a DVD, though, it was a sorry production. Somebody with a desktop video production rig decided to try out every special effect in the software...three or four time over. The video is very distracting, hard to watch, and only rarely relevant to what is being said. The music track is unrelenting and also distracting, sometimes to the point that you miss what is being said. (I must admit that the first music track, which sounds a bit like ""Riverdance""-type Irish folk music, is a musical genre that I absolutely abhor...so my opinion here is slanted by that.) Every time the narrator pauses to take a breath, the music volume swells in a most inappropriate way. The DVD is certainly not worth the price because the information is not appropriately presented for video."
1,$3 Bucks Down the Drain - Just Awful,I started the movie and could not get past the cheesy presentation or the music. Fast forwarded 7 min and the cheesy presentation was still going with the cheesy music and some cheesy person trying to speak over it. No way I could get through any more of it and turned it off. I generally wait until the end of a movie to give it a fair assessment. In this case I did not need to wait till the end; two minutes was as long as I could stand. Save your money!!!! TOTALLY TRASH
1,"don't see this horrible, horrible movie!","This movie was the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I wouldn't even give it one star. A complete waste of my time and money. Shop well, don't see this movie. Horrible, horrible movie!!!!"
1,Avoid This Turd At All Costs!,"I ordered this DVD mistakenly, confusing it with Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" which was also released in 2006.I suffered through about 30 minutes of this near unwatchable film in the hopes it was a slow starter. It would be no exaggeration to say that in comparison to this picture a movie like ""Ishtar"" looks like a cinematic masterpiece."
1,"TERRIBLE, UNWATCHABLE GORE FEST","I also was unaware of the fact that there were 2 ""versions"" of the movie. I have to ditto other reviews. Horrified, my husband and I fast forwarded assuming this was some sort of dream sequence gone bad and the investigation would start up soon. Wrong. Just avoid this movie it is really awful."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Sadly, I also confused this movie with the one released in 2006. The ""acting"", ""directing"", and ""filming"" of this movie are so disgustingly terrible. I paid $10 for this movie, and I should have known that the quality was going to be poor. Do not waste your money!I only gave it a 1 because it made me rate it, otherwise it would be a -100."
4,Excellent Disk Drive,"The Raptor drives are simply awesome. Great speed. Great Reliability. I have mine in a RAID 0 configuration, and the speed is just screaming. With the arrival of the newer VelociRaptor drives, these older generation drives have become very affordable, and they still beat 80% of the drives out there right now! Their only down side is that they are noisy - they grind and grind. Still I wouldn't trade em ... well, maybe for the VelociRaptor ..."
2,okay but do not use as primary with Vista 64,"Vista 64 will consume nearly all of the space on this drive as it create loads of files in order to opperate in 32 and 64 enviros. You will be left with about 10g of space after a little bit. It really is not that fast but it is cheap. And, it is 74gb not 740gb as it shows in the title."
3,A real page-turner,"A real page-turner, original plot, very suspenseful. But in the end I didn't care much about Titus or Rita. And I found the baseplot of the terrorist intrigue VERY confusing. This is about my fifth David Lindsey novel and wasn't my favorite, but was very good."
5,A twister,"This is one of the most weirdest movies I have seen.. in a good way. It's not so original with the big shock factor.. but it is original in its plot. I think this film was very intersting and the acting was good. I don't really have anything negative to say about this film.. but I must say a lot of people I have talked to about the film ""didn't get it"" because it does deal with some unfamiliar territory, but I say check it out for yourself.. and I must add that I think most people should understand it.. but there are those few. I don't think you will be dissapointed! Also, it's one of those that you should really watch beginning to end.. don't walk in at the end and expect to ""get it"""
4,Who is the Murderer?,"Ten strangers, a chauffeur, an actress past her prime, a call-girl, a cop who is transporting a killer, a pair of newlyweds, and a family in emergency are stranded at an isolated motel during a wicked rainstorm. It appears that they all have something that they attempt to hide, however, their secrets begins to unravel as they are killed one by one. Their only key to survival seems be related to their their secrets, which they have to reveal if they want to stay alive. Identity is an intriguing film with a clever plot based on an Agatha Christie novel, and like all of Agatha Christie's novels there are several clues for the audience to try to figure out who the killer is. Nevertheless, Identity brings a dark story to the audience that can cause puzzlement and bewilderment, which in the end offers a fine cinematic experience."
5,DON'T READ ANYTHING !!!,"If you don't want to ruin anything, then stop reading, close this page and simply buy this DVD, or just watch it somewhere ! The fact that you don't know anything will make this movie an outstanding piece of entertainment. No reviews, no plots, no introductions ! JUST WATCH IT !!! ...period."
5,a Thriller that delivers,"A solid cast stars in this suspenseful whodonit that pretty much keeps you guessing to the end. The logic remains true throughout - a big plus for me because I hate it when movies aren't even true to their own logic. The movie sucks you in from the start - you need to pay attention from the very first frame on - and doesn't let up as we find ten people stuck in an out-of-the-way motel during a bad storm. Then, as if there wasn't enough stuff going on, people start getting murdered. It just keeps getting better. I was surprised by seeming twists in the plot and reviewing found no major holes. I rate it five stars because I certainly would recommend this film to friends (and have) and have added it to my personal library."
3,The first half of the movie was good buy yhen.......,The beginning of the movie plays out like an Independence day(I hated that movie). The ensemble class of characters converge on this motel. People start turning up dead but the thing I wasn't expecting was that I started to care for these characters. I was rooting for the Cusack(who was suprisingly very hunky in this film!) character and the Peete character to hook up but then I felt cheated with the movie twist. So I came away from the film feeling dissapointed.
4,UNPREDICTABLE,"THIS MOVIE WITH AN ALL-STAR CAST IS A GOOD MOVIE. CUSAK, PEETE, LIOTA, JAKE BUSY AND THAT WEIRD GIRL FROM THE FACULTY. I SAW THIS MOVIE THE FRIDAY IT CAME OUT AND I WAS THOUROUGHLY IMPRESSED. IT WAS SUCH AN EDGE OF YOUR SEAT MOVIE. EACH CHARACTER HAD DISTINCT PERSONALITIES ABOUT THEM AND AT THE END OF THE MOVIE RELATE THEM TO THE UNPREDICTABLE ENDING, YOU WILL FIND IT INTERESTING. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL WATCHERS. I TOOK MY WIFE TO IT THE SECOND TIME I SAW IT AND SHE GETS SCARRED AT ANYTHING AND SHE HANDLED IT SO ITS NOT SCARY. BUY THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT COMES OUT IT IS GREAT."
2,Everybody Dies,"John Cusack and Ray Liotta, amongst others, get lost in a motel in the middle of nowhere. It`s a rainy, obscure night, and suddently people start getting murdered for no apparent reason. As each character dies, the closer we are to descovering who the murderer is...This James Mangold`s thriller (""Girl, Interrupted"", ""Kate and Leopold"") has a few nice twists and surprises, but the character development isn`t strong enough to make us care much and the multiple changes on the last part only make it worse. It has a suspenseful atmosphere, competent acting and neat direction, though the final result doesn`t step above average. A decent, schizophrenic thriller, but nothing great or terribly exciting. Watchable."
2,overwritten and overrated,"If you've seen the Sixth Sense starring Bruce Willis, you know what its like to watch a quality suspense film with a monster of a twist at the end.This movie falls far short of that standard, and I'm suprised to see so many good reviews. The shizophrenia angle seems chucked into the movie 3/4ths in and not stiched-in throughout the plot.The result, I found, was ridiculous. If you want to watch a quality movie about the human mind playing tricks - I'd recommend the Sixth Sense or even Fight Club.Those are films that bear repeat viewing. This one's a rental."
4,Not bad...pretty interesting...,"Your basic scarey film with a plot that travels in a circle. It involves a ""random"" group of people that all end up at the same motel. Horrible events bring them there and continue throughout their visit.It doesn't come together until the end of the film, because of all the flashbacks/flashforward...but if you take the time to watch it you will be surprised in the end. It is NOT what you thought."
2,CONTRIVED AND CONVOLUTED,"I don't blame the actors or the talented director who guided this confusing mess through an endless series of contrived and mindless twists and turns. Nope. The problem clearly is just this: the script is entirely B.S.Those who liked Usual Suspects (a film I thoroughly hated) and who enjoy the work of Hitchcock (a director who never did anything for me) ought to get off on this fakery.Like I said, cast is very good, with the exception of Jake Busey."
2,Remember That Movie Charlie Kaufman's Bro Was Writing,"in Adaptation? Check it out, it made it to the big screen!"
2,Made me feel like an idiot...,"OK. They tried to make something really different here. But making a wild turn next to the ending of the film, a turn that made clear that all that happened before a lie (or a kind of dream) was inexcusable, absurd, and made me feel like an idiot. (maybe that was the intention of the producers...)Technically, the movie is very good, and acting is top notch (except by the father of the little guy. Watch his expression of ""disbelief"" when he sees a victim that had a baseball bat stuff into his throat.... But, even feeling a kind og guilty pleasure watching this movie, I can not help but feeling cheated."
4,good,"a good suspense/horror movie with a big twist at the end that didn't work for me, though it should be commended for it's originality. the extras are pretty good."
3,not schizophrenia,"this is more a review of amazon's review- get your facts straight on mental illness- this would connect to multiple personality disorder, NOT schizophrenia- two entirely different disorders. My brother has schizophrenia, and my whole family comes across one common myth after another that people believe."
2,Ghostly Court,"In reminiscence to Hitchcock's classic, a film tells of ten strangers staked and murdered at a motel, but presents an emphasis on mental conditions meeting something supernatural.I think combining weird with earthy is not a too clever attempt itself, adding a kind of round table court proceedings surely.What is realistic it is a completely inappropriate court order which reflects movie-makers own civic expertise probably."
3,Good Movie,..One of those movies where you have to watch it twice to pick up on all the little details. Not a blockbuster movie but definetly passed the time nicely on a rainy Sunday! I'd watch it again.
4,A great murder mystery...,"Spoiled by a cheap slasher scene at the very end. ...Do I smell..Sequel?! Nah, did rotten in the box office to cover the cost, so at best this will have a direct to the bin release."
5,Well Written Movie; Well Done,"This is a fantastic film with incredible cinematography. This would be your standard ""thriller"" with unexpected deaths, destruction of property, and unseen killers enganging in destruction, one by one, of its prey.The location, a motel, in a deserted, rain-drenched location, is fairly creepy. Fate has had it so that many different individuals, through partially related circumstances, have to spend the night in one creepy motel. One by one, they start dying, and one by one, the story appears more odd. Who is doing the killing? It turns out that the principal suspect--the convicted convict--is not the killer. I will not spoil the ending, but it does have an incredible twist by presenting a plot that would not be expected.The writers of this screen play thought very deeply about dreams, thoughts, schitophrenia, and multiple personalities.WELL DONE.Michael"
3,"Good Beginning, Weak Ending","Most of what can be said (and shouldn't be said because it spoils the movie) has been said in other reviews. Overall, the film is well done in terms of acting and building suspense. But it loses a lot when the mystery is revealed. The revelation I feel really takes away from the movie because it is such a cheap answer to the questions in the viewers mind. In spite of that I would have given it 4 stars if it were not for the very cheesy, cliche last scene.I think the movie is worth seeing even though it is disappointing."
4,identity movie,"great movie, leaves you wondering through-out the movie who is the killer, so if you dont pay attention, it will lose you. but they do throw lots of hints, so pay attention. Whether you figure it out or not, it's a great twist to who it is. Then watch it again to see all the clues you missed."
3,"Great perofmances, good cinematography, predictable ending",Identity was a pretty good movie runied by a predictable ending. The film reminded of Lifeboat but with a scarier atompshere. The film in my opinion really didn't have any jump out of your seat moments. John Cuscack and Ray Lioltta are in top form as always and Amanda Peet looks yummy as always. My only other compliant with the film was that Jake Busey had such a small part. Still it's James Mangold best film since Copland and worth a look.
2,Pass up this one,"Hackned script and bad acting by all but a couple of actors. I found the ending different but unsatisfying. At the beginning, the dialogue was mumbled and low, so I tried to turn on the Closed Captions, and found there was none. Alfred Hitchcock did the Bates Motel much better."
1,From someone who saw it at the theater,"This movie a joke. It is an insult to any viewer's intelligence. The shocking secret is so blaringly obvious, it's beyond stupid. The ending of the movie is a total ripoff. Save your money. The only saving grace is the actors, but then the story is so lame that it totally overshadows their performances. A total letdown."
1,Did anyone else notice,that this is the movie the stupid brother in Adaptaion was writing?Identity is an absolute waste of everything and it actually sucks more than I have let on...
1,!!!,"Simply Horrible.If you need an explnation see the movie.If you don't agree, you deserve this tripe of a film."
3,Would have been a great movie if...,"[SPOILER WARNING].....the writers didn't pull the cheap trick of telling us that the story we'd been following and the characters we'd been identifying with through the entire movie only existed in some crazy guy's head, and then using their lunatic deus ex machina to tie up their inconsistent plot points. I was enjoying it up until that revelation, at which point I ceased to care."
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"Definitely a good flick but I'm not sure you need to buy it. A rental would suffice. One word to the wise; DO NOT buy this for the ""alternate ending."" It doesn't exist for all intents and purposes. They add just a few flashes of the main character in a flashback/dream sequence at the end. That's it! BIG DEAL! The advertising on the package touting a widescreen presentation with an extended version is bogus."
3,Don't believe in your eyes!,"'Identity' is a competent and hard thrilling suspense movie which has two great points when compared with the other films of the same kind, especially the more recent ones: originality and a good (although not original) finale. Director James Mangold know his office and give to us a solid suspense which, sometimes (especially the scenario, an old and decayed motel) resembles the classic 'Psycho' of the master Alfred Hithcock. The solution of the mystery - that I'll not tell here - was used in some other movies, as you will find afterwards. Good performances all around, with a special consideration to Pruitt Taylor Vince, as the accused serial killer and John Hawkes, as the nervous motel manager."
2,"Seems interesting, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK","Sounds like a great thriller, great trailers, etc. Movie's going great until almost the end. The whole story is in some crazy guy's imagination and none of it is real. Waste of money!"
2,Fargo trumps Ten Little Indians,"It was a dark and stormy night. Several strangers, that we are slowly (very slowly) introduced to through a series of out of disordered flashbacks, are force to stay in a sleazy motel. As with all sleazy motels people start to dismantle ""Fargo"" style. The characters have the audacity to compare their situation to Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" so is the last one standing the culprit? At least we are not treated to a gushy love story overlay.Not all the gimmicks in the world can disguise this common slasher movie posing as a physiological thriller.And Then There Were None - Starring: Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston Director: René ClairTen Little Indians - Starring: Hugh O'Brian, Shirley Eaton Director: George Pollock"
4,"3.5 Stars. Surpisingly decent, if you only watch it once","This film plays out like a typical slasher movie for the first hour, and then comes the inevitable mind-blowing plot twist. But...The plot twist in this movie is a logical resolution to a believability problem the movie was spiralling into. The introduction of logic into a movie of this genre is in itself mind-blowing. For that reason alone, I felt my time was well spent with this movie. I could relax and let its flaws slip past my attention. But then...I thought about the movie as a whole, and felt that the plot was still a little ridiculous, but I let it go, because I felt that any movie with a well thought out plot twist deserves some leniency.My only advice is not to watch this movie more than once, because, absent of the shock of the plot twist, this movie is no better than your average slasher movie."
1,A Great Big Gigantic Headache,"Without giving away too much, this movie is both figuratively and literally a great gigantic migraine headache. Headaches of any kind have never been enjoyable. This one is no exception.If it weren't for John Cusack and Amanda Peet, they would have never been able to produce this movie with the absolutely non-plot storyline. Why does Cusack even agree to star in such a dumb movie? He has talent, as well as Peet - at least I think so."
2,Waste of time!,"This film had a lot of hype going for it. So when I actually saw the film I was very dissapointed. Now it'snot as bad as all that, but it's just another hollwood piece of tripe, thrown together very quickly in order to make an extra buck.John Cusack is excellent in it, which is very surprising since he had to get his tongue twisted around an awful script.Never the less, I did enjoy it for a while, but the end was simply crap. It was one of those annoying endings that could be the ending to any film ever made. Which is very annoying because it just felt like whoever wrote couldn't think of an ending so he just pulled this one out.Rubbish ending. Not particurlarly engaging. If you want to see a really good film, that's set in a motel on the road, then just watch Psycho.Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho that is, not that crap re-make."
1,"Man, this movie sucked...It is only good if you...","Man, this movie sucked...It is only good if you stop the movie after the part where they think it is some ghost from the Indian barial ground that is killing them off one by one.If you watch any of the movie after that point (which is a about an hour into the movie) you will be very disappointed, IT JUST GETS STUPID.Please take my advice, I scratched the last 45 minutes of the movie off my DVD, I suggest you do the same."
1,This title is ripped...,"The same principle to this story was written by Stephen King in an earlier work of his entitled ""The Secret Window."" This story just has more ""personalities"" and more victims. The writers should've come up with something out of their own minds, not out of the mind of one of our great literary achievers such as Stephen King...a disappointment to say the least."
2,Excellent but it bums out totally at the end....,"The first hour or so of this film is fantastic. The setup is simple. Different people get caught up in a flash storm only to end up in a motel where they start getting bumped off one by one. The story is very interesting, fast, with lots and lots of plot twists along the way but it all falls to pieces in the end with what the filmmakers probably thought was a unique and original twist-type-premise for the whole film. It sadly is not and even the final scene is like something out of Scream VII.Watch ""Brazil"" or ""Jacobs Ladder"" instead to see how they got this kind of a plot twist right."
3,Fatal flaw,"I did enjoy this film, I thought it was sufficiently confusing enough that it left you in suspense yet not so confusing that you give up watching. However, there is one fatal flaw to this movie that I really would have thought they would have bothered to get right - the guy portrayed in the movie doesn't have schizophrenia as everyone has been led to believe - schizophrenia doesn't involve multiple personalities it involves hearing voices of others. What the guy in the film seems to have is Dissociative Identity Disorder(Multiple Pesonality Disorder) where there's more than one distinct personality in the same person.You'd think that they would have bothered to actually get the disorder right that they're writing a whole movie about. There's enough confusion with mental health disorders without the mass media contributing to it.Other than that not a bad movie."
4,different,"When I first started to watch this movie I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but once I got into it, it was pretty good. Totally different story line. If you like a good horror movie you will really like this one."
3,Truth Being Told,"Seriously, we have all done something worth cringing about. This book brings about some of those things that make you scratch your head and want to go hide under a rock...but the title is very fitting."
1,UMM.... WHAT CAN I SAY?,"First off, was she her own editor? Because there were a lot of mistakes in this book, the more I read the madder I got. Most of the time the book didn't make sense. I paid way too much for this book and it was only 100 some pages, and it didn't have any kind of meaning. I take that back the meaning of this book showed me that she was DUMB & STUPID AS HELL. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy Fly on the Wall by Trista Russell it's better and cheaper."
2,"Amusing, but nothing more","I hate to be a stick-in-the-mud here, but this book is really NOT a ""phrase book"" and should not be listed in the language reference section. As an American who lived in Germany for three years and suffered the slings and separable-prefix arrows of learning this fascinating, complex language, I appreciate the humor at the heart of this book. But the examples here are really for people who understand that this is just humor at the expense of German and Germans -- someone buying this book thinking that it will allow you to be witty in German should think again -- You'll regret using any of the conversation examples here on a native speaker."
1,where did you get these phrases?,"i am german, live in germany in the north. i never heard about these phrases with the wurst and the gugelhupf not event the street phases."
2,"Hummm, do you really wanna learn German?","Well, the book is sort of funny but really not very useful if you are trying to learn some serious german...the likelly outcome is that you will have a few laughs and thats all...."
5,Perfect,"I first heard some of the Roadhog recordings many years ago on a cassette tape my brother sent me. I have been wanting to get the whole collection on CD ever since. I am ordering today!Having played fiddle in many C & W bands for over 20 years in all kinds of venues from the big time down to places just like the ""Johnny Mac Brown High School"", I can tell you that this is the real deal. I've known people just like the characters in this band.If you've ever been in a real juke joint (pre Urban Cowboy days!), you'll be able to appreciate this work."
5,Classically Funny!,"This never gets old. I played this for people at work, and they about died from laughter! I remember listening to this when I was just a kid...it's still just as funny now as it was back then."
5,Good Stuff,"This album was one of the better jazz record purchases I have made. Clifford Brown's trumpet playing is most excellent, and Max Roach's drumming is fantastic. George's Dilemma is a great track...lots of moods created and some good ambient drumming. If you like jazz, buy this album."
3,Worst threat ever,"In the midst of this one the Doctor makes a statement something along the lines of ""this is the most dangerous enemy ever"". Wait a minute, he says that in an awful lot of stories, I'd hate to see the most most dangerous enemy ever.The Doctor, along with Jo as his companion, are still stuck on Earth in this one. Unfortunately, so is the Master. The Master hatches yet another plot with the invention of a machine that can remove the evil from a hardened criminal. How can this be a world dominating move? Hmmm, guess for that you need to read the book.I found this one a bit less interesting than many of the other novelizations I've read, but still an OK story. It takes less than two hours to read, so there are certainly worse ways to spend your time."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"This has to be the worst DVD i have ever bought.Not only is this extremely tame and not in the least bit offensive,its not even the remotest bit funny to compensate.Beetle uncensored doesnt even come close to REAL 'shock documentries' like Steve-O,CKY and Jackass.The very few pranks that u see are repeated over and over again and are neither crude,shocking or funny...at least 1 out of 3 would be OK,but not in this case...Basically put,if u enjoy flushing your hard earned dollars down the toilet,then this is a must see."
2,negative,Not happy with the limited geographic area or the depressing news that a single/widowed or divorced woman would have no chance of ever dating or finding a future partner. I would have hoped for interviews taking in a broader area and with women who have had positive real estate purchasing/building experiences. What I got from this was stay away from the Lake District if you're looking for an authentic Mexican experience.
5,Midlife Mavericks,Well written...author develops a good position on opening ones opportunities......Both the positive and the negative are explored.
2,"IF YOU LIKE GOOD WRITING, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!",I AM STILL PLOWING THROUGH THIS POOLY WRITTEN BOOK. I FEEL LIKE A GRADE SCHOOL CHILD WROTE THIS STUFF. WHEN A BOOK IS THIS BADLY WRITTEN IT'S HARD TO KEEP READING IT. HOPE I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE END.
4,Great Inspiration,"I purchased the book, Midlife Mavericks by Karen Blue, a couple years ago when I was facing unexpected changes in my middle years. I have also spent time traveling and camping in Baja since my college days and have friends who have gone the extra step and purchased property in Mexico. It was wonderful to read the stories of these women's lives through Karen Blue's interviews and inspirational to learn that change can be a positive adventure at any age. Her book made me want to gather these women together to share more stories and a glass of wine on the patio. I was unfamiliar with Lake Chapala and have since acquired travel books of the area. All this has lead me to finally planning a trip to Guadalajara and Lake Chapala. Thank you Karen Blue for helping me plan my next adventure!"
1,DVD of the damned...,"My ""review"" is solely for the DVD itself and not the movie it contains. I ordered this double feature a long time ago and threw it on the shelf to watch when I was bored. Well yesterday I found myself with a few hours to kill so I thought I would take a look. Well, much to my frustration, my player could not read the disc. I thought it might need to be cleaned or something, but I tried a half dozen other movies and none of them had any issues. So it looks like the DVD has some kind of an issue that won't allow it to be recognized and played. I noticed a couple of other people had the same issue. So bottom line is this...While I cannot speak on the movie itself...I would not buy this version of the movie because it seems to be hit or miss on whether or not it will play. Just wanted to send out a little warning to prospective buyers. Have a good one!!!"
3,Scared The Crap Outta Me!!!,"First, let's do the math . . . it's May 26, 2004 and the DVD for this flick isn't coming out for another 2, 3 months or so. I haven't seen this movie in it's entirety since I saw it in a theatre in 1960 or 1961! (When I was 8 or 9 years old.) I can't recall much of the plot but it seems to me that it's a bit clumsy if not contrived. But the kids with the glowing eyes really freaked me out! Hokey by today's standards but very effective then. And there's that one scene where someone, a man I think, is threatening the kids and this little boy says to him, ""Leave us alone! Leave us alone!"" And then the glowing eyes thing starts! Very eerie. I'm gonna get the DVD just to see if my memory of this movie is justified! Bring it on!"
2,Not anything like the remake,this 1960 version of village of the damned is not worth seing its so low budget and not even scary like the remake all the victims in this movie u never can see because their is nothing to show dont get this movie
2,Dumb City,"Village of the Damned isn't so bad. George Sanders is always worth seeing. But the film is an obvious cheapy (made for under $300,000), and you have to be about eight to get excited about the strange eyes of the strange children who come, apparently, from another planet. In the end, the hero blows up the monsters (and himself); the classic cheapie horror show ending.Children of the Damned is much worse. Again, an obvious cheapie, this sequel can't figure out what the strange children are supposed to be doing on the planet. The couple of sentences uttered by the head freakie kid make no sense at all. So, in the end, the children with the strange eyes are all destroyed. Again. What a waste of film."
4,Village of the Dammed,Saw it when I was a kid and it scared the hell out of me then and it's still good today.
