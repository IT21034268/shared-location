2,Worked for a day,This otoscope worked for about a day! I went to use it a couple months after I bought it and the light does not stay on - like something is loose. Not reliable. Should have realized you have to spend more to get better quality.
2,New Pro Otoscope,"Bought this to have handy for use on my children, however, it did not work. Fitted it up and the fit was poor. When I finally got the light to work, it kept shorting off. The construction is also not very user-friendly and the handle is very big and heavy when trying to manoeuvre. Had to return it for another brand."
3,works but not well built,I'm a physician and just needed something simple for home. This works fine but the screw which holds the plastic part on the scope fell off. Still works fine.
4,3.2v Halogen otoscope,I'm happy with the otoscope. The halogen bulb burnt out fairly quickly but once I notified the company they sent me two new ones free.
2,Poor Flavor,"I am a long-time fan of butter toffee peanuts. Nowadays, the only place I can find them is at WinnCo in their food bin section. I LOVE the flavor of their peanuts but am skeptical to buy food in bins. As an avid Amazon shopper, I discovered these peanuts and thought I'd give them a try. The package arrived within the estimated date and in great condition. However, the flavor was blah. The toffee coating was horrible - no taste at all. For the price, I expected them to taste at least as good as WinnCo but no such luck. Won't be buying these again."
4,Egg Drop Blue by J. T. Banks,I am a member of Southwood Book Club and this book was discuss on May 2003. I really like this book and I will tell all my friends to read this book.Marilyn from Meadowview in C. C.Hills IL.
3,Stretching?,"I get the indication that the author is sort of reaching in an attempt to prolong this series. Better to leave it as is and go off on another track, in my opinion."
2,"Rambled, lacked a cohesive plot, and loaded with obscenities","While the book proports to deal with aviators in the Army's fledgling battlefield use of aviation, it was actually a year in the life of a General's aide. There was a great let down to find, at the end of the book, that the tactics, trade-offs, and conclusions reached as a result of the Army's study of the new battlefield assault techniques, were never discussed! This isn't about aviators, just an old General reliving a lot of non-combat dreariness he had to contend with. Definately a no-brainer in which the ""hero's"" gutter level language distracted, rather than added to the plot - if there even was one."
5,Brotherhood of War,My husband loves all of these books. He keeps reading them over and over. He no longer can read a regular book so the Kindle is very important to him.
5,comment by the editor of the book,"This book is 10 years old, but in thisslow-moving field where results are hard won,most of it is still worthwhile. Just thefact that you are contemplating buying thisbook puts you in a very rare class IV ofindividuals. Confirm your status and buya copy! 2000 were printed, looks like a fewstill left. get 'em while they're hot."
2,Much better options out there,"I have bought several of these over the pat 4 years and they all turn out the same. work fine for the first year/winter season maybe 2 then they quite working. They do heat your house well and save you money on utilities, but if you have to replace it every year are you really saving money? I dont think so but a better quality heater fan instead to make this purchase worth it."
2,Small and weak,"This is a decent heater for a cubicle desk or a tiny bedroom, but don't assume it will work well for any space bigger than that. Seems to use a lot of electricity compared to the heat it puts out. Would be an OK buy if you can find it on sale for less than half the retail price."
4,Fluffy Hair? A must have,"I have very lightweight hair and I'm glad there's a product that will help weigh it down. I expect most people buy this for short hair to spike it up or whatever, but I have long hair and I use it to weigh my hair down so it's not too fluffy. Just a little spray on the completed hairstyle and it works well."
5,THE STRAY CATS SECOND ALBUM ON CD,"The STRAY CATS second album is one of their best and it's finally available on Amazon. And some people say there's no God. This recording was never available domestically. Their first two albums were British IMPORT only. I still own this IMPORT on vinyl and I've been trying for ages to find this on CD. The Japanese IMPORT has been available for a while, but it's too pricey. Finally, a clean copy of WASN""T THAT GOOD, my favorite cut off this album. Quick, put this in your CART while it's still available!! REV IT UP AND GO!!"
4,Gonna Ball,"Album was released in same year as the first one. It's a mix of rockabilly (""Baby Blue Eyes"", ""Crazy Mixed Up Kid"", ""Gonna Ball"", ""Little Miss Prissy""), Chuck Berry and Jump blues (Wyonnie Harris' ""Wasn't That Good"" and ""(She'll Stay Just) One More Day""). Various musicians are featured (Ian Stewart, formely Rolling Stones' on piano, Brian McDonald on harmonica, Steve Poncar and Lee Allen (who played on dozens of hits and many hundreds of sides, by artists including Fats Domino, Lloyd Price, and Little Richard) on saxes,...). Very nice!"
4,The British albums are the best,"The US ""Rock This Town"" album supposedly took the ""best"" cuts from the Stray Cats' two British albums, ""Stray Cats"" and ""Gonna Ball.""Well, not really. There is a whole lot of great stuff on the British albums that you'll be missing if you just buy ""Rock This Town."" I hunted for the British albums on vinyl many moons ago, and I'm glad I did. They still stand as the Cats' best albums, in my opinion."
1,My fault,"Having upgraded my oher computer, I wished to have a copact XP, not to clutter my desk. It was my fault not to check carefully. This Compaq d530 ultraslim is a good design But I did not know you can not operate it without a MultiBay CD/DVD drive. I can not find a MultiBay drive anywhere. So the d530 is sitting there on my junk pile"
4,Good for chips,"This product worked well on bulleye and star chips, I was very satisfied, but I would not recomend it for long cracks."
3,"Worked O.K. for me, not perfect","I had a small crater in the center w/ a few thing star burst cracks spreading out from the crater. Small crater, 1/4"" and 1"" long very thin cracks. I applied the resin 1 time w/ the suction cups and 3 times w/ the curing plastic sheet. It filled the crater and cracks in somewhat but they are still visible. the crater is a whitish color now. i think i should have tried taking out the plunger once more and gently screwing it back in. Maybe I'll try again w/ the suction cups. Anyway the crack is still visible but overall it is smaller and less obvious from before. my car is old so I don't care that much. I recommend this product if you don't want to pay $50-60 to get it fixed and you won't mind if it doesn't look perfect. The bottle can probably do at least 3-4 repairs."
4,Did What I Needed It To Do... So Far So Good,"My biggest concern was to keep the crack from spreading. I wasn't too worried about it still being visible as its location made it not so obvious. It was very easy to do. I did it in the parking lot of my office because it was open and sunny and allowed me to leave it sitting for a while to set. The crack itself was sealed from the outside to the point that I can run my hand over the spot and not feel any indents where the crack is. It is still visible though, so I hope it won't continue to spread through any inner layers of the glass. At least for now, if it doesn't spread, I won't have to shell out a few hundred dollars to replace the windshield."
5,great kit,"This kit is great, it has enough resin to do many repairs after you learn how to use it properly. Match it with a cheap uv light and you will never go to a glass shop again. To make perfect repairs you really need to drill the glass with a diamond bit in a Dremel tool to be able to get the resin into the affected area. That is a requirment with the pro kits also."
2,Mediocre at best,"It might have made a little difference, but with the time and effort required it should have made more, price was cheap, but ""repair"" was only mediocre."
2,Useless for a STAR-BREAK type chip.,"I bought this item for fixing a small chip (less than half inch) on my windshield. It's a STAR BREAK chip. However, this kit didn't work for this type of chip. Due to the physical press when I use the kit, the crack even enlarged to 1.5 inches. I was very disappointed and decided to look for local auto glass store. If you have a STAR BREAK chip, this kit WON't help you. BE AWARE."
4,Worked quite well on a 13 inch crack,I had a 13 inch single crack in a windshield and tried this product. My main concern was stopping the spread of the crack since I didn't want to replace the windshield on an 11 year old car.The product worked quite well as the crack as not spread since using it. Although the crack is not completely invisible; it is much less noticible after having used the product. For $10 it was well worth it to try this product as it saved me the cost of a replacement windshield.
2,Don't expect a miracle.,"Perhaps it was the way my rock chip impacted by windshield, but this product did almost nothing to repair the chip. I cleaned-out the chip and followed the instructions, positioning the suction cups, adding the resin, compressing and repeating. After scraping off the material, it is still apparent where the rock chip is located."
3,Good on some things,"I have to say I was somewhat disappointed. I had a small hole from a hail storm that spread a little but. While this did great with the hole, the applicator just didn't force the resin in to the small crack that shot off. I will give it a few days to see if I am wrong but I am assuming I will end up needing professional repairs. As this was a very small repair it fits well within what is claimed for the product. Had I gotten it before the crack spread a bit I think it would have worked, but I believe the plunger just doesn't have the ability to force resin in past the surface."
4,Windshield damage significantly reduced,"Product came as described, when expected. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. I had 2 small circular cracks in the middle of my windshield. After using the product, the extent of the damage was significantly reduced. The damage is now barely noticeable."
4,works but window is not like new,"Had 2 cracks from pebbles on my windshield, one small, one even smaller.Took me about 1/2 hour to fix the first one, and then 10-15 min for the smallerone after having the experience from the first one.The small one is still noticeable, but far less than before applyingthis product, and I think what's left just a minor cosmetic issue at this point.Did seem to fill in the crack, and you have to look for it, but youcan easily find it. The tiny crack, I can't even find. The larger of thetwo was maybe 1/8 inch hole plus radial cracks out to less than 1/2 inch.Overall I would recommend for small repairs, inexpensive and not terriblytime consuming after the first repair."
4,"Not perfect, but works well","Product works well for the money. I will say that it is not perfect, but probably decreases the visibility of a stone chip by about 60-70% if it is done right. You would pay 5 times this amount to have it done at your local window repair shop and I doubt it would be much better. One note, I found that having it cure in direct sunlight is important and even though the instructions mention that, they do not emphasize how truly important it is since I tried it without doing that and the product did not cure. Make sure you have some sunshine available. All in all, a decent product for the money."
3,"Works fine, but not brand new look","This product works fine, but it's not going to make your window look like new. But I'm happy overall, saved me 100+ dollars."
4,"Works, Even If You Can Barely Screw In A Lightbulb","I have no mechanical acumen whatsoever, so I approach anything that involves a little repair commonsense with great trepidation. I'm happy to say this product is easy to use, even for me, and it works. I can still see the small point of impact where the rock hit my windshield because I know where to look, but the ""spreading out"" effect is completely gone.The secret is resin, judiciously applied through a pretty fool-proof aiming mechanism, that goes into the crack itself and hardens. One reviewer says don't go overboard on the resin - well, don't go too light, either! My first try was unsuccessful (too little resin, and it wasn't lined up just right - so be very careful to put the applicator directly above the point of impact), but second try was a breeze.Don't just watch that little crack grow and grow - you have an inexpensive way to stop it!"
2,Did not work well,This product did not work as well as I expected. They tell you the chip on your windshield will be invisible when you are done. I tried this on 3 different windshields with different size chips. The chips are still quite visible.
3,Fix-a-Windshield,"I had several bullseye cracks to fix. The Fix-a-Windshield mechanism is the best I've found. That said, it is rather difficult to get the resin plunger tube perfectly over the small hole. Once it is lined up, it worked okay and filled the bullseye. After the final drop of resin and curing, I still have a small crater (the size of a pencil lead) where the rock hit the glass that is visible and rough. The rest of the bulleye was filled and is about 70% clear - I still see the outline of the bullseye.All in all, much better than nothing, but not as good as paying a pro. A mobile glass pro wanted $60. This product has repaired 2 bullseyes so far, and more yet to come, for $15."
3,May not work for all,"This product is okay. Sort of filled out my chipped area but cracks are still visible. I had about a half inch crack and it made the crack slightly larger after i was done. I was patient and waited about a hour for the resin to reach all areas. Even tried it 2 more times after to fill out the cracks but no luck. Be careful when cutting off the resin tip to open the bottle, you don't want to spill and waste any of it. It's a cheap solution to try if you have chips/cracks and seem to have worked for most people with all the positive reviews. Instructions were very easy to follow (maybe even too detailed). For under $20 shipped, it's worth a shot, but keep in mind that it may not work for everyone."
4,Works fairly well.,"As others have already stated it depends on the type of damage you have. I had 7-8 chips on my windshield all very small. I used the suction cup method of 3 of the biggest and it worked fine. As an experiment I tried just using the resin (no suction cup apparatus). I just put a drop of resin in small chips and just covered them with the curing strip and let it sit in the sun for 10mins. It worked perfectly fine. I was surprised and was able to do all 8 or so chips in less than 40mins.One warning, use the resin very sparingly! Unless you have a huge crater 1 drop is more than enough. Also if the resin drops down when you remove the suction cup apparatus, don't worry. Quickly cover it with the curing strip and you wont have to add the extra drop as suggested by the instruction."
4,Excellent results,I was unfortunate to be behind a trailer that had shed something like pea gravel resulting in a couple chips in my windshield. I got the Fix-a-Windshield from Walmart for $10 and tried it. I'm very pleased with the ease of application and the overall results. I would say that the chips are 80% hidden and knowing that they shouldn't grow is comforting. I did 3 and still have enough to do several more.
4,saved my windshield,"Worked good to save my windshield from cracking more, but it doesn't make it invisible it just fills the crack."
1,did not work completely,We followed the instructions to a T.It did not completely repair my nicks and crack.I would not recommend this product on old nicks or cracks that have been there for some time.The nicks and cracks are too deep in the middle layer of the glass and cannot possibly reach it. It only helped the surface damage.
3,Lowe's review,We had a small crack in our windshield. Fix-A-windshield worked. It may work even better on a bullseye crack.
2,The price is higher than walmart's? Dont buy,i dont think it is a good idea to buy this product here. It is priced higher than walmart and including shipping it is almost double the price.
1,I Can Build a Computer from Scratch.....,"Instructions were very clear and easy to follow, but it just didn't work for me. Have to find another option."
2,Call Insurance First!,"Don't bother purchasing this product! Most Insurance companies will send out a company to fix small cracks in your windsheild for FREE! Once you apply this product, they won't be able to fix it.Besides, this didn't do anything. Just made my windsheild un-fixable by a professional. Call you insurance company first."
2,20% Chance of working,"This seems all good in theory and has clearly worked for some people, but not for me.First, only 2 of the 4 suction cups worked. This makes the apparatus much more difficult to use and very uncomfortable on the hands.I had a tiny bullseye type ding, it barely helped that one. I have a larger star crack, and it was useless. It did not penetrate into the cracks. I tried multiple times and consider myself pretty adept at this stuff. There simply wasn't enough pressure from the device to push the resin beyond the point of impact.Didn't work for me...but worth a try for the price and other positive reviews."
4,"Pretty good, not perfect","This product is pretty good, not perfect. I've had a couple of professionally-repaired stone chips on my windshield. They more completely made the damage disappear than did this product which I used on a single-pane house window. Still, for the money, I would definitely recommend this product."
2,you need heat gun to use this kit,you need heater to use this kit.I don't have heat gun nor extension cable for it and my apartment is on third floor.now my money is wasted.well if you have home and all this and that might work for you
3,You've Gotta Follow the Instructions,I used the Fix-A-Windshield product. It works ok but be certain you follow the instructions exactly. I erred on one point and ended with a globby mess. It does a fair job on small chips if you take your time.
4,"O.K for do-it-yourself, but not as good as the pros","I bought a used car, had a small starburst windshield crack, pros said it was previously (poorly) repaired, and wouldn't touch it. I don't really care what it looks like, I just don't want it spreading this winter, so I bought this kit. I used a dremmel with a diamond bit to drill out each tip of the star. The kit worked pretty well, but I'm not sure what ""glue"" it uses. It's not the ""liquid glass"" I've seen used (a sodium silicate ionic bond mix???), but rather, some ""plastic-like"" stuff. I'm no expert as you can tell.The kit worked well, easy to use, and I could easily cut (scrape) off excess glue.The crack and pits do not dissapear, or at least mine didn't, but that could be because it was previously ""repaired"", or I had glass dust in the pits I made.I'll try to update this after a few winter months."
1,Big disappiontment,"This product didn't work at all for me. I had a small chip on my windshield, less than half an inch in size, and I thought this one should be easily repairable using the DIY kits. After reading the reviews, I chose Fix-a-Flat product (had lots of good reviews, and was priced reasonably). It was delivered promptly, everything was included in the package, and it came with detailed instructions, which I followed carefully. Unfortunately, it didn't make the chip any less visible (not to mention disappear). Again, I did read and follow the instructions: cleaned the surfaces thoroughly, centered the applicator, allowed the resin to penetrate and dry as prescribed, got rid of the air bubbles, applied the finishing coat and moved it to direct sun, etc. - no visible improvements at the end. And then I repeated the whole procedure - still to no success. This was not my first DIY project, I've done lots of repairs to my cars - both mechanical and cosmetic, but this one was a total failure."
2,Resin works but doesn't repair crack seams well,The resin works ok and does what it's supposed to but the repair device itself doesn't have enough pressure to push the resin into tight crack seams. It would've worked if it was able to push the resin in.
3,Didin't really work,"I had several older chips in the windshield and used the product. It's possible this stabilized the damage, but there was no visible improvement."
5,Worked well,"This was pretty easy to do. I was worried that it would require a lot of skill but it really didn't. After I fixed the one major star in the windshield, I started to hit all of the little pits that I could see. Then I did the other cars windshield. I don't think the resin will keep now that the tube is open so may as well use it while I can."
3,worked but messy,I had 2 small cracks and 1 bullseye on my windshield from a tree branch falling on my windshield during a thunderstorm. All three were smaller than a dime. The cracks were near the center of the windshield and the resin made them look much thinner and almost undetectable unless you know where to look. The bullseye was close to the bottom of the windshield and I couldn't fit the mount onto it so that one wasn't fixed. The resin does take a while to scrape off with the razor though.
3,"Good product, not for everything","I think this is a good product, and for the price it definitely beats letting some ""professional"" windshield repairers have at it. However, it is important to note that the product is not for all windshield repairs. While it is advertised and has directions for breaks with a running crack or star chips, it doesn't work as well as it does for chips and bulls-eyes.I attempted to repair 2 chips that had a running crack that joined them... needless to say it made it next to impossible to repair as when you applied the pressure to the resin in one chip, it leaked out of the other. I ended up using much more resin than the directions called for, but was able to get a satisfactory result.There may be a better product out there for breaks with running cracks, but I have seen this work wonders on regular rock chips and bulls-eyes."
5,works really well,"i'm a 29 year old female, and i did this by myself on my windshield, and it worked great. it covered the gouge very well--almost perfectly. there was also a star crack radiating around that site. i can still see it, but it definitely looks smaller. i made the repair a week ago, so time will tell if this repair kit prevents it from cracking more. if it cracks, i'll update this review. if i don't add anything, you can assume that it worked! =)"
4,Good product!,"Good product, made the crack less visible. I had to go over it twice though because the first time it did not work so well."
2,didn't work for me,"I followed all the directions carefully, tried it twice, but it had no impact on my crack. On the plus side, it's a year later, and nothing has changed!"
4,Surprising results,"This product actually gave decent results. I had a bullseye crack in my windshield from a flying rock, and it is barely detectable after using the resin. I did go overboard with it and ended up chipping away the excess resin for quite some time with the razor blade. Unfortnately it doesn't come with any sort of bag so I'm using a ziploc bag to keep all the pieces together if I need it again."
2,Fix-A-Windsheild,"I had a small chip to repair product did not work that good, can still see chip as before repair."
1,Applied it 3 times never worked once.,"I read the directions carefully, followed them to a tee and I thought it was working but in the end failure. The pressure device did not do anything for my star crack after 3 attempts so I used a lighter on the windshield and the fluid moved into the crack so I thought it would work. I moved the car into the sun and by the time the fluid hardened it had moved out of the crack as well. So I kept trying 3 more times reappling fluid and putting the curing pad on it with the car in the sun over and over. Everytime I would use the lighter on the inside of the window it would fill the crack then after an hour in the sun the fluid was hard but it would keep moving out of the crack. Very frustrating and time consuming. After hours of trying no noticable improvement at all. Very dissappointed."
1,complete crap,"I had a small rock chip, well within the specifications they gave. I followed the directions to the letter. absolutely no noticeable difference at all. This was a complete waste of money. Not only was there not a visible difference after the treatment, the chip cracked from one side of the windshield to the other over the course of the next few months."
1,Doesn't Work!,This product does not work as claimed for the repair of cracks in your windshield! I followed the directions very closely and it did not work!
1,"would ev, could ev but it didn't work",Read the reviews on the Fix-A-Windshield and sounded like a real no brainier way to fix my dinged windshield. Checked the prices to have a pro do the job and for the $ 15.00 cost of Fix-A-Windshield/freight sounded like a real bargain but in reality was over priced. As all I ended up with was a splotchy spot over the ding. Though on a positive note it may have slowed the progress of the crack spreading from the bulls eye. We will see...
3,Should be ok if you don't do what they say not to do,"package has a couple of rules:don't use on an old or dirty crackdon't use on a crack larger than 12""don't use on a window that's cracked on both the inside and outsidewell i violated all three of those rules and guess what, i didn't work so good. but since it said it wouldn't work i won't fault the product for that. the thing that sucked about this product was that it says it will cure in 10 minutes in the sun. i had the truck parked in the sun all day and the stuff was still tacky. finished scraping it off the next day best i could but i think the photo-initiator in there was not at the right concentration or something."
1,Waste of Money - Very Disappointed,"I received product quickly. I followed the instructions carefully to repair a hole/chip with no cracks from a kicked up rock. After multiple attempts I gave up. I was very dissapointed. Perhaps it may work in your application, but I am unable to recommend based on my experience."
1,Simply didn't work,"The problem is the resin never really seeps into the cracks. I followed the instruction to the letter. Now it looks the same as before. No difference before and after. My only consolation is I paid only $10.93 inc. shipping. At the Auto Show, a vendor was selling this same product for $20. Now I have to save and pay for a new windshield..."
2,the crack is still there,"I followed the instructions to repair a crack. But the entire crack is still completely visible from the outside and inside. The best I can hope for is the seal to prevent water from coming in again, while keeping my fingers across..."
2,Didn't work,"Tried several times on my Mercedes windshield, my grandson even tried it and it didn't work for him either. Not worth the money."
1,Only does half the job,"I purchased this kit for a very small chip in my front windshield. I read the directions before I started, and then followed them word by word when working. This product will fix a chip as far as filling the entire area and restoring the surface to original smoothness, BUT the big downside is that the resin DOES NOT DRY CLEAR. My clear chip is now a white spot! Terrible."
2,Not very effective on cracks,"I used this on two different damaged windshields, one with a bullseye defect and another with a 7 inch crack. On the bullseye I was able to fill in the defect and make it look better although the damaged area was still somewhat visible. On my cracked windshield I apparently could not get much of the product to penetrate the crack, despite moderate pressure on the windshield from the inside in order to open up the crack a little more."
3,Okay,"It's an okay product. I believe that it probably helped my chip from spreading, but it is in no way equal to a professional's work. I have a 96 civic so I'm not exactly worried about aesthetics too much, just that I don't have a huge crack running across my windshield."
3,Eh,"Filled the chip but definitely did not become trasnparent upon hardening. Also a strange method to require the resin to cure in the sun. What if you live in a rainy part of the world? I had to redo several times because of rain and clouds. That said, it did what I needed it to do: fill the chip and stop the crack. But the description of how it would look after got my expectations up and I was definitely less than pleased with the final appearance of the fill."
4,"Decent seal, cheap fix!","I used this product to fill several chips after a speeding landscape truck pelted my 6-day-old windshield on the freeway. With six visible chips, the windsheild people recommended another total replacement (um, no, I had paid them $200 less than a week prior), so instead I thought I'd give the $13 fix a shot.The product actually worked best on the two most offensive/deepest chips, which were starting to get that bullseye look. I followed the instructions to a tee, and the little seal tool patched them right up with optical quality resin - can't even tell they were there. The product didn't work as well on the more subtle ""skids"" where the points of impact were sort of ""frosted"" in appearance, but it didn't hurt, and it's cheaper than a new windshield."
4,Good Product,This product works. I rock chipped my windshield. I reviewed several brands before I saw this one. I bought this from Walmart. Tried it the next morning when the sun was fully up. I have to say that this product worked really good. Not 100% but better than paying $200 with a glass repair company. Worth my $10. I recommend.
3,"Informative history and photos, but not a true hiking guide.","We were looking for information on hiking in the Mt Hood area. This book is a good supplement, but not helpful to those who are not already familiar with the area. To be fair, the author herself says this is a supplement, not a definitive guide. The photos are lovely."
2,Not the same Jenni,This are not great songs. The CD was a waste of time to do. She doesn't sing the same on this CD. It's like it's not even her. She needs to do another one. Hate this style of hers.
3,Good For Beginners Only,"When I got the three Pimsleur Spanish CD's I thought I'd be very far along with my goal to learn spanish. I have learned a lot via Pimsleur, but it didn't take me as far as I thought it would. It gave a pretty good overview of the basics in Spanish, but nothing more.I've since switched to Platiquemos and I am just finishing up Level Two. Bottom line for me: Pimsleur is nice way to be introduced to Spanish if you can afford it. Platiquemos will take that introduction and run with it. There is some overlap between Pimsleur Spanish 1-3 and Platiquemos' Level 1, but I recommend starting at Platiquemos' Level 1 once you finish all three Pimsleur's. If you want to go the cheaper route just start with Platiquemos and work your way through Level 1. It may be tough at first, but you'll learn a lot quickly.Good luck in learning Spanish!"
3,"Maybe the best, but flawed nonetheless","This goes for all Pimsleur, really ... I agree with most of the positive reviews, and I've finally accepted that the (used) price is more than justifiable.But the incompetent digital coding is not excusable. I am currently downloading the discs into iTunes, and each disc is named differently. I have to hunt and search through my directory for each file, and make sure the name / artist name / album / album artist / grouping all match. It is a royal 'effen pain."

2,boring.,"Pimsleur Spanish 2 Intermediate.Disc 1 (lesson 15 etc. )Exceptionally boring conversation between a business man and the secretary of the guy who did not show up.They discuss whether to go eat (they don't); The fact that ''it is not cold if you do not go out of the building...''(they don't); the possibility of going to a movie (they don't).She abruptly says ''I am leaving right now''. He says ''Goodbye''.Maybe one learns a tiny bit of usage , but the overall experience was MORE boring than an old B movie with missing reels.SO....if one learns better when the experience is pleasant.....NO, not fun.The printed booklet is a little more droll, possibly unintentional humor?I learn that there is a lady who apparently sells toys, she has a kitten, but wants to have a big dog.....hmm.I recommend this method as an excellent way of falling asleep...(i did)."

5,Level appropriate,"Looking over the comprehension books, I felt the reading passages were grade level appropriate. Sometimes it will be listed as 2nd or 1st and be too difficult or easy. These would have pleased Goldilocks."
4,Good for my supplemental plan,"I use weekly homework bags during most regular weeks, but this book provides a supplement for extended work for some of my students. I have also used this alone for homework on short weeks and track off weeks. It is straight forward and doesn't require a lot of time and extra effort to prepare."

3,thanks a lot Warner Bros...,"Thanks a lot Warner Bros. Records -- you introduced us fans an idiot RHCP Greatest Hits CD. If I didn't like some of the songs so much on here, I wouldn't be so pissed. I mean, come on, once upon a time, there was a guitarist named Hillel Slovak as part of the Chili Peppers band.Disc 1: First 10 YearsTrue Men Don't Kill CoyotesSubterranean Homesick BluesJohnny Kick A Hole in the SkyGood Time BoysHigher GroundUnder the BridgeGive it AwaySuck My KissSoul to SqueezeLove RollercoasterDisc 2: Last Ten YearsAeroplaneMy FriendsAround the WorldCalifornicationOthersideRoad Trippin'Scar TissueBy The WayZephyr SongCan't StopAt least they aren't sellouts. If you think they are sellouts, just hang on to the funk tunes."
2,Gimme a break!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd could have been [so] good if they put the good songs in it. Sure they have the song ""fortune faded"" which is new and good but still, so why do we call a greatest hits album ""greatest hits""? It is because greatest hits album contains the most wanted songs from the fans ...NOT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY (...) So please save ur money and buy ""Californication"" or ""Blood sugar sex majic""."
4,"great, yet disapointing","A Chili Peppers greatest hits album could have been so great, given that they are quite possibly the best band of the last 20 years. However, this cd isn't a true portrayal of their greatest songs, nor does it represent their whole career. If I had constructed a greatest hits album for them it would be a 30-track double-cd with the following songs...True Men Don't Kill CoyotesIf You want Me to StayBrother's CupYertle the TurtleFight Like a BraveBackwoodsMe and My FriendsHigher GroundSubway to VenusTaste the PainKnock me DownBreaking the GirlSuck My KissI Could Have LiedGive it AwayUnder the BridgeSir Psycho SexySoul to SqueezeMy FriendsCoffee ShopAeroplaneAround the WorldScar TissueCalifornicationThis Velvet GloveBy the WayZephyr SongCan't StopOn MercuryFortune Faded-all those songs I listed in order of cd's, and even their track numbers on the cd. I know all that by heart because I am such a big Chili Peppers fan."
2,"Curse you, Chili Peppers!","The release of this album is a godsend, because it means I don't have to review every Chili Peppers album detailing why I hate it. It's no secret that I did go through a RHCP phase a few years ago when I didn't know much better, but now I see them for what they are: nothing but overgrown dumbasses with misconceived notions of their own musical and sexual prowess. I won't deny that John Frusciante is one to often toss in some tasty licks and that Flea is a technically gifted bassist (if an excruciatingly annoyingly showy one), but it's all overruled by Anthony Kiedis' hideously inept stacatto rapping and his comically atrocious crooning. Next."
3,John Frusciante's Greatest Hits (Not Really A Bag Thing),"I'm really not quite sure which approach the Chili Peppers are trying to take with this collaboration. If the album is a collection of their greatest hits, meaning their most well-known and most played singles, then it should have included singles like ""Aeroplane"", ""The Zephyr Song"", ""Around the World"", and ""Can't Stop"". If they were truly going for their best music, then they still didn't get it right; they included no songs from their 80's albums besides ""Higher Ground,"" and the album doesn't do a good job of showcasing the brilliant work that is Blood Sugar Sex Magik. John Frusciante may be the Chili Pepper's best guitarist by far, but that doesn't mean that every single song they record with him is a masterpiece. As close to true as that is, you wouldn't know it by hearing songs like ""Suck My Kiss"" or ""Road Trippin'"" over fan faves like ""Sir Psycho Sexy,"" or ""Pretty Little Ditty."" If you like what you hear on the radio, dive in."
4,RHCP Collection,"If you love RHCP's newer stuff, this collection is for you. Every song on this album (aside from the 2 new tracks) have been played to death on the radio. Granted, I love the older stuff, but the newer stuff still has that Chili Pepper vibe and grooves in them. However, they left off tons of material. This could have easily been a 2 cd set.If you have this album and only this album (which I find hard to believe) I recommend picking up ""What Hits?!"" as well. That way you have the beginning of their career on one disc and their current stuff on the other.Side note: The linar notes inside written by Flea and John are awesome as well."
2,Hardcore fans only...,"This album is just not that great. Songs like Californication, Under the Bridge, Higher Ground etc. made RHCP rightfully famous, but this album is not worth your time.I like a lot of stuff on this album, but most of the songs don't belong, making it hardly worth shelling out $15 (sometimes more).If you like stuff like By the Way, Californication, or Scar Tissue, you should buy the Californication album and/or the By the Way album. If you prefer their wild and crazy side--songs like Suck My Kiss, or Give It Away--get Blood Sugar Sex Magik or Uplift Mofo Party Plan.Overall, this is for collectors only. Too many songs have been left out, and replaced with unworthy ones"
2,Blasphemy!!!!!!,"This seems like a compilation that was put together by label ceo's. I find it appauling that the earliest song on this album is higher ground. Where the heck is ""Knock Me Down"", or ""Fight Like a Brave."" These are great songs that I think should be heard by any chili peppers fan. If you are a true fan of the peppers I suggest you NOT buy this cd if you are some random jerk off who wants to hear ""Scar Tissue"" a million times then buy it. My own personal favortite RHCP song isn't even on this compilation. Where's ""Aeroplane?"" As for the two new songs they put on here I have to say download them off the internet, legally or illegally. Don't pay full price for this compilation. Even the cover art work looks like a lack of thought was put into it. Don't get me wrong I love the chili peppers but this greatest hits album leave the late Hillel Slovak spinning in his grave because the obviously forgot about him on this thing."
5,A great compliation of their radio hits,"Forget about all the great songs that aren't on here. This compliation is just too good to pass up. It's obvious that the Pepper's put in a wider range of songs that would really represent their unique style. That's why less popular(and under rated) songs such as Road Trippin' are on here. Sure it would have been nice to have songs like All Around the World and Can't Stop on this album but hey... I'm happy with what I got. Honestly, the Peppers really have too many great songs to make a definitive collection of their work. But they came damn near close with this one. If you're just a casual fan of the Peppers I would recomend that you pick this album up as soon as possible. Hardcore Fans will want to pick this up for the new material (which is excellent) and the inclusion of the great ""Soul to Squeeze"", which was previously only available on the Coneheads soundtrack. A great Collection for anyone!"
2,What?,"What's wrong with the missing ones? Around The World, Can't Stop, Aeroplane...WTF??? GREATEST hits my ass."
3,shucks,"There are good songs on this album but there definatly should be way more songs , would I buy it definatly but im still a little disappointed"
3,Try this 16 tracks,this would be mine 16 tracks...have I left anything out1.Give It Away2.Aeroplane3.Scar Tissue4.Soul to Squeeze5.Otherside6.Suck My Kiss7.Under the Bridge8.By the Way9.Around The World10.Breaking the Girl11.My Friends12.Higher Ground13.Zephre Song14.Californication15.Can't Stop16.Fortune Faded
3,just one question...,"....how the fk does 'Parallel Universe' make it on to the Best Of cd over 'Around the World'???? Who agrees?Around the World is the rockinest track on Californication and sounds like something off BSSM compared to other tracks.Actually one more question. Does anyone else think that some parts on 'Parallel Universe' sound like part of the chorus from 'By the Way'? If so, then how dumb is it to put both tracks on a Best Of cd, with one right after the other, no.8 & 9. Parrallel Universe shouldnt be on the cd at all.Also The Zephyr Song is easily better than Universall Speaking, it shouldn't have been left off.Lastly, there shouldn't be 5 tracks from Californication, if BSSM only has 4 tracks. Road Trippin should have been left off and been replaced by another track from BSSM which had way better songs than Californication.End."
3,Greatest Hits,"As many of you who have bought a ""greatest hits"" album before you should know that ""greatest hits"" rarely means ""best of"". I reccomend for you to buy the chili peppers' other albums and let you be the judge of what you think their ""best of"" is."
5,chilis do it again,"We all knew that because this album has the title the greatest hits on it it would have all the usual... eg under the bridge ands scar tissue... but personally i was suprised when i first saw the track list for this album... no cant stop and no areoplane... they seem to have forgotten the navarro years, which to be truthful works really well on this album... its nearly all an advertisement for fruscinate and it works... i can only fault a few thing like for example the lack for realised chili pepper songs like acnt stop and power to equality but it works because it shows a mellow side to the chili peppers... i am a bit dissapointed that they have not included anything from the first three albums ... but that is what 'what hits ?!' was for... the high points are the two new songs.... its an essential album"
5,RHCP at their best.,"Maybe this CD is half of the Californication CD, but who really cares? That CD was awesome, and now combined with songs like Under the Bridge, Suck My Kiss and Higher Ground, this CD rocks."
1,"these are their ""greatest hits"" - not their best music","Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs on this album - but this is a collection of their commercial successes, not their greatest music. There earlier stuff ( their best stuff in my opinion ) is not well represented. While all the chart-toppers from the last 3 albums all there, songs like 'Fight Like A Brave', 'Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky' and 'Backwoods' have been left out. Personally, I would consider ""What Hit's"" if you are looking for the Chili Peppers from the late 80's / early 90's."
3,yeah right,"Of course there is something wrong with this greatest hits cd. Notably, the absense of 'Around the World' 'Aeroplane' and 'Can't Stop' as well as FIVE songs from Californication.Also, if they're goin to put on 'higher ground' and 'under the bridge' which are also on 'What Hits' then 'Show Me Your Soul' should also be on there"
1,good for new fans but not quite the whole best,"i know this is supposed to be a greatets hits cd but they left out so many great songs that dint get radio play ,but were as popular as the ones that did im insulted by this compilation because the RHCP greates hits is more than 12 songs .IF YOU WANT TO GET to KNOW THE PEPPERS get the last 4 cds (blood sugar sex magic,one hot minute,californication,by the way) and the what hits compilation and the singles rollercoaster and soul to squeze and you will know why im giving cd one star"
5,All of the essential Red Hot Chili Peppers greatst hits in one low priced package.,16 of these best collected together in one single disc set. If you are looking for the best of the Red Hot Chili Peppers I would recommend this set. It is a great place to start your collection. All of the truly essential songs are included in this low price set. Truly the best for less than $10.00 who could ask for more?
3,where is cant stop and the zephr song?,those 2 are my favorate rhcp songs but i love the others. under the bridge is awesome.
2,Red Hot Chili Peppers Greatest Hits not so hot,Not the best compulation I would have come up with. Only had one or two songs on it that I liked. But oh well Its in my collection now. Maybe it will grow on me later.
1,This band sucks.,Most definatly listen to this garbage before buying anything by this band. Annoying pop rock garbage with stupid lyrics.....horrid band.
3,"Why ""scar tissue"" and no ""Can't stop""?",I will admit I am not the biggest chili peppers fan my roommate at college let me copy this off him before I burned it I got rid of the aweful played out scar tissue I hate that song always have always will had it not been so played out I would have left it on anyway And I had to go a download Can't stop just so that I could feel like I had the true greastest hits. I will not understand what people saw in Scar tissue I like every other song on the CD and its become my most played disk so why three stars you ask? it loses a star for scar tissue and loses another one for not having Can't stop on it
3,Alright,"I love RHCP and I was disappointed after finding out that there weren't a lot of tracks on this cd and that a lot of the songs were the slower ones. They are a great, diverse band with lots of different types of songs and I think this CD did not do the diversity a favor."
5,"Great band, great songs.","This cd really impressed me,the Red Hot Chili Peppers became my favorite band after i bought this cd. This cd has everything it has the slower songs like, under the bridge, californication, otherside, and my friends...and it also has more upbeat songs such as, give it away, suck my kiss, fortune faded, and by the way. These guys are truly great musicians, the lyrics, and the riffs are very catchy, you can't get them out of your head. If you are a true fan of the Red Hots you need this cd."
3,The Zephyr Song isn't there because it's not one of the best,"This is an anwser to the people who complain about the Zephyr Song not beeing on this album: get real. Many of the new ""fans"" know the Peppers only because of the Zephyr Song. But it's definitely not one of their best. Repetitive, cheap chords, weak solo (I wouldn't even call that a solo), that's how I would describe this song. It didn't deserve to be on that album."
2,WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS?,"How in the world can you make a greatest hits and not include your greatest hits??? WHere is KNOCK ME DOWN, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THE ZEPHRSONG, DONT STOP????? THis Greatest hits has songs on the cd such as UNIVERSALLY SPEAKING that wasn't even released as a single... OTHer than that the songs are great and the new single fortune's faded is classic peppers... BUT if you are really picky about your greatest hits and already have blood,sugar,sex,magic and californication then dont waste your money.."
4,Its About Time,"This is the first time that a compilation CD of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been released with a large number of their great songs. What Hits?! is good if you like their early to mid eighties songs, most of which are excluded on this disc. Almost all of their great songs are here including ""Higher Ground,"" ""Under the Bridge,"" and ""By the Way."" The only disappointing part is that they left off ""Around the World,"" which is understandable since it was never a hit single. It is also great that they left off the heavily overplayed ""Zephyr Song"" which was played alomst 3-6 times on every rock radio station from September to late December 2002. Still a good hits compilation for the second half of their career."
3,Missed,"This could be 5 stars rated but it is not.why? that's why :there is a good song ""Higher ground"" (Stevie wonder cover) from their 1988 classic album ""mother's milk"" - why haven't they put something more representative like ""taste the pain"" or super hit ""knock me down""? that is beyond me.where is one of their biggest nineties hit ""Aeroplane""??? they have put ""My friends"" from the same year that actually haven't been heavily popular (but it is very good) .""Warped"" (hit single) could be a great choice too...why have they put ""Universally speaking"" their worst single ever? this anemic and not really catchy song from ""By the way"" could be replaced with much better b-sides from this album like ""Gong li"".anyway - i understand that it is a continuation to ""What hits"" and it shows their new modern funk-rock-pop sound but why it is missing so important songs? i do not understand...ps.Happily two new tracks are very good."
2,"Some good stuff, missing lots, HORRID sound quality","I'm not going to into track selection much. You can see the track selection yourself fairly easily. I will say all the songs on this album I enjoy.However, the sound quality is as bad as it gets. It's easily the loudest album I own, and anything that was the chili peppers is flattened out as much as possible. Give It Away is a far, far cry from the original release quality.Do yourself a favor, since RHCP have only released a few albums in the past 15 years, pick those up individually (you'll get 90% of this Greatest Of by picking up their last 3 releases). Then track down the ORIGINAL ISSUES of RHCP's early stuff, they used to care about sound quality and had some really great stuff back in the day. Just don't get fooled by the ""Remastered"" editions, they will have hacked sound quality just so it can sound as loud as modern releases."
4,ALMOST PERFECT,"This is a great collection of songs , but it's missing five hits from there album One hot minute , including Aeroplane and many other's , i guess the reason there not on here is because none of the band members were fond of Dave Navarro , which means that is why they didn't include the five hits on here , i guess they don't care if we like them."
1,This Is A Band That's In Dier Need Of Some Talent,Red hot chili peppers suck...why waste my time telling you people why. You all know its true
1,Teddy Bears Picnic CD,"The CD arrived with a flaw in one spot. It was on the only song I really cared about on the whole CD, The Teddy Bears Picnic. I will probably not use Amazon again, since I hate to hassle with returning items by mail and all the communication it calls for, so I just threw the whole thing away."
4,A very approachable text to early United States history,"Though, like any history textbook, Bailey's wades through a sea of dates and names, he also has a wry sense of humor which makes the text often fun to read. From quips about prostitution and presidential inadequacies we see that this author is more than just a noted historian, he is a burgeoning comedian, too."
4,"Its a pot, what do you need to know?",It came quickly. It was as it appeared in web-page. It holds dirt and a plant. SO it does what it is supposed to.
5,A Hard Rockin' Girl,"Back in the 80s the girls rocked as hard as the guys! Sometimes even harder. One of those rocking girls was Fiona. She was never the big hit maker that Joan Jett, or Lita Ford were, but she was still able to carve out her own niche. This is Fiona's second album, but there's no sophomore slump here. The song writing, playing, and Fiona's rough edged voice all shine! Her version of ""Thunder and Lightening"" is as good as it gets, and most of the other songs are highly polished rock jewels. The production values are quite high on this album. The songs have a depth that take them beyond a lot of the hard rock of the 80s. The only time this album slows down is with the obligatory ballad ""He's On My Side"". But before you know it, you're back in rock territory. And it all wraps up with the absolutely kicking ""Keeper of the Flame"".If you like your rock hard, and your girls able to belt out a tune without getting lost in the wall of sound, then Fiona is a girl you should get to know."
4,excellent introduction to the philosophy of action,"The book is an excellent read and it provides a solid introduction to the problems in the philosophy of action. Moreover, The book does not simply serve as an introduction but it also sets out Mr. Moya's views on the problems he introduces. His views are most interesting and certainly shed light on the topic. The book is also particularly profitable for those interested in Davidson's views on action. It is highly recommendable for those interested in action theory, especially from an analytical perspective."
2,"Interesting, but not a success","The subject matter of The Voyage of the Narwhal is exceedingly interesting, and Ms. Barrett's meticulous research comes through beautifully during the descriptions of the Arctic wilderness and the historical expeditions that either came before or were going on concurrent with the fictional one of the Narwhal. But unfortunately, the subject cannot overcome the almost amateurish character exposition and the uneven dialogue. Barrett is never comfortable letting a character's actions speak for themselves, instead rushing to bludgeon the reader with thesis statement sentences at the end of nearly every exchange. It's depressing. Also, the last fifty or so pages of the book are something of a train wreck, as the conclusion of the action is a motley assortment of different and equally unsatisfying plotlines contorting together to form an ending."
3,Interesting if you have an interest in the topic,"This was a fairly enjoyable read - a little slow in parts, but overall interesting. It felt like a bit like a sequel to Dan Simmons'Terrorabout a mission looking into John Franklin's disappearance in the Arctic. It was well researched and the character of Zeke was especially easy to hate - he made a good villain in that there wasn't anything redeeming about him. A truly loathsome villain like him certainly added a lot to the story. I wished that there had been a bit more of the ocean itself in the book, but the historical detail all felt accurate and thorough."
2,"Considering the hype, disappointing.","This book has received copious accolades from critical reviews, however, I was disappointed that the writing was so weak. An interesting enough story of a natural historian's recollections of his arctic journey, the story seemed to lose it's emotional charge when the setting returned to Philadelphia. I would have enjoyed more focus on the arctic exploration and interaction with the Esquimaux. I never did bond with the protagonist. Rudy Wiebe's, ""Discovery of Strangers"" is a much better read."
2,Melville Barrett is NOT,"I read that Barrett is a modern-day Melville - NOT! There is no personal tragedy or inner struggle. No revelation! The novel is superficial and shallow. What about Man against the Elements? The novel has too many loose ends, a weak plot and stagnant charachters. I think I will pick up my copy of ""Typee"" or ""Omoo"", or maybe even ""Moby Dick"" and become absorbed in a true ocean journey."
3,"Good story, but confusing characters","Interesting story. There's something about that time in scientific exploration paired with the exotic Arctic that makes this novel work. Zeke and Erasmus are fantastic characters, but I felt their relationship wasn't explored/developed as much as it could be. Also, I felt conflicted about what the author intended regarding Dr. Boerhaaves and, especially, Alexandra. Were they supposed to be major characters? They seem uncomfortably stuck somewhere in the middle."
4,Chilling in More Ways than One,"I chose the book because it features a 19th-century arctic sea adventure and its toll on a small crew who have to face its challenges. I was not disappointed. Amidst ship life with its own chain-of-command protocols and other policies/procedures, the crew's battle with the arctic elements was starkly portrayed and interesting. And even more interesting were the relationships, betrayals, and loves along the way. I was really drawn into this narrative. The characters face physical and emotional challenges that make you wonder how you would have fared."
2,Too many agendas,"I love stories about ice and snow and I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The author has crammed in so many political and scholarly agendas that plot and characterization seem like afterthoughts. Not that I disagree with those agendas, or couldn't be convinced, but this could have been done with more subtlety and skill. The stilted style may be an attempt to imitate the exploreres of the period, and sometimes it succeeds, but more often just comes off as bad writing. The bits of history (human and natural), which were the main draw for me, got lost in the unconvincing and blatantly revisionist struggle between Erasmus, 19th-century New Age guy, and ruthless powermonger Zeke. Ho, hum."
3,I really wanted to love this book.,"It's hard to believe that a book lacking descriptive imagination could still be 400 pages! I anticipated this book with great enthusiasm. I wanted to feel the cold, and wanted to hear the crunch of the ice. I didn't. The only goose pimples raised on my skin occurred on the very last page when young Tom got his spiritial revenge on the easily hated Zeke. If it gets more readers interested in Franklin and Kane than it will be a success."
2,Don't Read a Novel -- Read the Real Thing,"As pointed out by others, this novel does a good job giving a reasonably accurate picture of the arctic but does a lousy job of developing characters or an entertaining story line. Given these facts, there is no reason to read this novel. Rather, pick up a book that describes actual arctic explorations and you will get a more detailed and accurate picture of the arctic. Read what Nansen saw and did, read about the Kane expedition (for real), or read a survey of arctic expeditions such as Fergus Fleming's Ninety Degrees North. But don't read this weak story. It has nothing to add."
5,Definitely a winner,"This book deserves the highest praise. I wasnt sure I wanted to read a book about the exploration of the artic but I am glad I try it. This work is a perfect example of the power of fiction. It transports us to worlds we never imagined and enlightens our minds. I feel like I traveled north with Zeke, Eramus and Ned."
3,"Entertaining, but superficial","This book is generally well-written and delivers some stirring scenic descriptions. However, the author has not provided characters to match her settings. They are thinly realized cutouts whose feelings and motivations are not developed. Therefore, the reader is not led to care much about what happens to them. The Esquimaux, particularly ""Annie"" and ""Tom"", were the best realized characters, perhaps because they were the only ones who seemed to know what they were doing. The author apparently researched her subject well, yet the book evinces a late 20th century, rather than mid-19th century, sensibility and attitude. I read the ""Voyage"" with a book group. Its strengths and flaws stimulated a lively discussion."
5,"thrilling exploration of ""failure""","this book works best as a collection of terrible, brief images which are difficult to escape. death is often described in a single sentence, in a very spare, matter-of-fact way. while barrett's descriptions are breathtaking and exact, there's nothing romantic or sentimental here- the environment or simple accidents will just kill you outright.yes, the characters are slightly flat and their motives not always well defined... but this seems intentional. they are almost totally overshadowed by the terrifying arctic, and in the later third of the novel, by the uneasy, somewhat unreal world they return to."
4,A Great Frost-Bitten Read,"This was one of my favourite novels of 1999. Barrett's impressive research and attention to detail comes through on every single page of this beautifully crafted book. It is not just the story itself that captures your attention, it is the entire presentation that draws you in as well. From the extracts from old scientific works to the line drawings and the prose style, this novel carries you back to the nineteenth century brilliantly. Barrett's story contains great insights into why some men in the nineteenth century were driven to undertake seemingly insane expeditions into the Arctic. Greed, ambition and the potential for fame and acclamation ranked foremost, while the quest for knowledge oftentimes came last.Fantastic."
3,i liked it.,I found myself liking a book on a subject I knew nothing about. I liked the author'sstyle of writing. It's that simple.
2,Narwhal Revue,"Larry- This is the third time I've written this, hopefully this time it will work. Anyway, I thought the book was too plot driven and had little if any characterization about any minor character. Furthermore, it seemed to be a overly researched book. By that I mean that creativity was lost due to the adherence to facts. And, for being a plotty book, it was too long. The main story should end when they return from the voyage. The remainder from the book from that point on is dull and drag. The best part about the book was its neat cover."
1,Shallow and Unrealistic. Poorly Researched,"Having an interest in arctic exploration and being told I don't read enough fiction I picked this book up with high expectations. I suffered through the character development which could've been over looked if the rest of the story had any substance to it. This book will entertain only those who are ignorant of what is really necessary to undertake such an endeavor. It's obvious the author took the ""canned approach"" and only brushed up enough on arctic exploration to hang some thinly disguised window dressing. I'm sorry-this was a major disappointment. I would've given a ZERO RATING, but it wasn't an option."
1,Barret's on Conrad,"What drew me to this book was the blurb that compared the author to Joseph Conrad, specifically this book was compared to Lord Jim. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There's no passion in the pages. Characters are flat and predictable. This story was far beyond the author's ability to tell it."
4,dj envy block party vol. 1,"dj envy block party vol. 1 surprised me. it has a superstar lineup of rappers on it, such as jay z, redman, jadakiss, ja rule, dmx, juvenile, murphy lee, joe budden, foxy brown, petey pablo, 50 cent and gunit plus alot more... there are alot of real good tracks on this album such as h.o.v.e by jay z, and what,why,where,when by styles, why wouldnt i by fabolous, dblock by dblock, focus by joe budden plus alot more. if this album surprised me, its gonna surprise all of you's, so i suggest you buy this album."
2,Could be Better,I don't think I listened to any track b4 track 9 more then a few times and that's where all the top notch rappers are.The only good songs would be big things and yes Sir.
2,Where have all these Peppers gone ...,"For the whole day (July, 7th) while listening to this record, I've been asking myself if it's what I'd expected to hear. It sounds like it was the stuff which couldn't have managed on ""Blood Sugar..."" and has been postponed; but it is supposed to be a brand new stuff to compensate these 4 years of waiting! Neither heavy nor funky enough; sounds like an average grunge (!?) and will be soon forgotten. There are only few songs likely to remain - ""Around The World"", ""Scar Tissue"", ""Otherside"", ""Savior"" and maybe two more; elsewhere I fell like I'm listening to a band which plays keyboard only. So - don't look for the stuff like ""Apache Rose Peacock"" or ""Warped"" - you won't find it here."
2,The worst of RHCP,"This is a terrible album. It is quite boring and don't compare to Blood Sugar Sex Magik. They went from being totally original on BSSM and One Hot Minute to being completely generic on Californication. If you want real RHCP, listen to their old stuff."
2,Somewhat of a disappointment,"I am a hard core RHCP fan and have listened to their previous 2 cds hundreds of times, particularly bssm. I doubt that I'll listen to this one more than a dozen times. It's just not that compelling, clever or complex. I was tired of most of these songs after the third or fourth listen. I'd listen to it first before buying it."
2,Terrible,"If you think this is going to be another BSSM because of Frusciante's return, you're dead wrong. The sound quality is horrendous. More often than not everything was recorded too loud and it distorts. On top of that, the album is half filler material. Out of the first 6 songs, 5 are decent. After that the album pulls a complete 180. The songs just are not good songs. I only listened to the secondf half of the cd twice. The second time was to make sure i hated it as much as the first. If the album was as consistant as the first half, it would get maybe 4 stars. But overall, it is worth 2. Buy it if you must."
2,Tracy Chapman meets REM,"Go back and listen to Uplift Mofo Party Plan. Then listen to this record. It's better than One Hot Minute, but that doesn't say much..."
5,A MUST BUY!!!!!!!,This cd is a must buy if either you're a new RHCP fan or an old one. Each and every songs are awesome. A definite must buy!
5,Red hot chili peppers,"My review of Californication is that it is a vvvery good cd. It has many different songs that I like such as, Scar Tissue. Red hot chili peppers are my favorite band."
5,the best of the peppers,This is by far the best red hot chile peppers cd. It has all of the great hits that you hear on the radio. Around the world and Scar Tissue are probably the most popular songs on the cd. It has a mix of great music. This is the best Red Hot Chile peppers cd ever.
2,I don't understand all the hoopla.,"I've loved the Peppers for more than 10 years, and this album is a big disappointment. There are exactly 5 good songs on it: ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Otherside,"" ""Californication,"" ""This Velvet Glove,"" and ""Road Trippin'."" The rest are either mediocre (""Around the World,"" ""Easily"") or flat-out suck (""I Like Dirt,"" ""Savior,"" ""Right on Time,"" etc.) The best Chili Peppers albums are Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo Party Plan. They're just killer. Blood Sugar rounds out their top 3 albums. But even with Frusciante's return here, the Peppers drop the ball on this tepid, uninspired release."
4,Powerful Comeback,"The Chili Peppers created some great tunes in their newest album ""Californication."" Around the world features the most memorable sound of what true Chili Pepper fans remember of them. Somewhat nonsence lyrics, but great to listen to, and features a bit of what Flea is capable of on bass. I would have rated this album a 5 star, but I feel that dissing the very state that made them famous was sort of a slap to those who hail from the state and have nothing to do with the ""Californication"" they speak of in at least 2 of their songs. Either way, it's good ear candy, and a great album for those road trips. This album works extra good with Kicker Bass systems."
1,Vinyl Review,"First of all, must say that the album is EXCELLENT and one of my faves by the RHCP. However, the vinyl was incredibly disappointing. The mix was off and not balanced at all. I would've expected more from such an incredible group. If you are looking to add any RCHP to your vinyl collection, I recommend passing on this (unless you want it just for the sake of owning it) and getting Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead."
4,Buy Them A Star On The Boulevard...,"Most people who bought this CD probably did so because they wanted the title track. That's no surprise, because it's the best track on here lyrically. I love some of those lines...""Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement..."" ""Buy me a star on the boulevard it's californication""Some other songs on here that are well-done are ""scar tissue"" ""around the world"" and ""otherside."" They did well with this one, only BSSM is a better release by this group. Go get yourself a copy."
3,I bought it only for Scar Tissue -- rest was okay.,You have to love RHCP in the first place in order to really get anything out of their new CD. It doesn't really compare to Blood Sugar Sex Magik but I still like most of the songs....
3,How far can you take this sound anyway?,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a true enigma in popular music...white boys with soul, rockers who never rock, sexually experimental moralists, and all of these things come out on ""Californication."" Unfortunately, the other thing that comes out is that the sound mastered on ""Blood Sugar Sex Magick"" was probably best left to the annals of classic rock albums. That doesn't mean ""Californication"" isn't a good album, it's just that maybe it's time for the Chili Peppers to choose a new sound that they haven't already perfected. ""One Hot Minute"" was a nice step in a nice direction. While many fans were hoping for a return to a sound the band really only had for one and possibly two albums, one is forced to ask the question ""How far can you take this sound anyway?"" Still, some good songs and well worth the time invested, though the album may be three or four songs too long.Chris N."
3,Pretty Good cd!!,"Its great to see the Peppers back in the music scene!! This cd is pretty good, not their best but worth buying!"
3,Terrible Engineering/ Recording,"Don't get me wrong, I love the music, but can't listen to this disk on a good stereo. I've tried 3 different CDs on 3 different stereos. The high notes are so distorted that I first thought my speakers were blown. Especially on Anthony's vocals in parallel U & scar tissue. I've heard better recordings of Dead live shows. Am I crazy, or has anyone else noticed?"
4,"Good effort, so-so recording!","Not being a big RHCP fan, I thought I'd give this one a try. Catchy songs (Scar-tissue and Otherside) certainly catch my attention, however, the recording is sub-par (technically speaking). The mixing is not too hot, nor is the recording, which makes the listening experience not as enjoyable as it could be. Fix that and they get 5 stars from me!!"
3,Better than One Hot Minute....but no where near BSSM,"I'll admit it...I picked up album mostly for ""Californication"" ""Scar Tissue"" and ""The Other Side"". With the exception of a few others ""Right on Time"" and ""Road Trippin"" this album doesn't really shine. I love the Chili Peppers and I was very happy that John re-joined the band, but this didn't do much for me. Granted the sound of this albums is nostalgic to their earlier work, and it trailed away from the One Hot Minute mess."
2,Every tatoo on their body scares me.,The only good song is Scar Tissue. They all need haircuts and shaves too. Since I like 1 song I gave it 2 stars.
2,Exactly 3 good songs...maybe 4,"This is one of the weakest Peppers albums (and I have them all). It's a little better than ""One Hot Minute,"" but so is just about anything else. The boys sound like they're fakin' the funk. ""Around the World"" is a weak ripoff of the superior ""Power of Equality,"" and tracks such as ""I Like Dirt"" and ""Porcelain"" are just half-baked. The best cuts here are ""Scar Tissue,"" ""Californication"" and ""This Velvet Glove."" The worst are ""Get On Top,"" ""Purple Stain"" and ""Right On Time."" Everything else is just mediocre. Come on, boys, give us an album worthy of the Chili Pepper name, will ya?"
2,Really not very good,"I am a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge, huge Chili Peppers fan, but this latest album just doesn't have it. There are maybe 4 good songs on here, possibly 5. The rest are weak. I love the raw, fiery, passionate Peppers (see Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo), not the soggy, boring, limp Peppers (which is what we have here). This is SO FAR from their best album it's not even funny."
2,"Yesterday's news, yesterday's music","Don't get me wrong, this is a good band, or used to be. This album is not at all fresh and not really good. Please escort yourselves back to the ""where are they now?"" file at the earliest possible convenience."
3,"Several good songs, but not the best Chili Peppers CD","This album has several good songs, but it isn't the best Chili Peppers CD. Worth the money if you like The Red Hot Chili Peppers."
1,Disgusting,"This a review of the mastering, It is BAD. Perhaps the most infamous victim of the loudness war, but I hear so little of it from fans. The music is OK, I guess, but the sound is AWFUL. Consumer, educate yourself. END THE LOUDNESS WARS. Go get Blod Sugar Sex Magic, (original issue) it is the same, only it sounds good."
4,Pretty cool,"I haven't been a fan of the Chili Peppers for too long (BSSM, to be exact), but after listening to BSSM, I went back and bought Mother's Milk, which I think is one of their best, right behind BSSM. The songs on Californication really are hard hitting and remind me of some of the older stuff, but then maybe the last 2-3 songs sorta disappoint. Great album if you're a huge Chili Peppers fan (like I am now), but if this is gonna be your first Chili Peppers album, think again....go get BSSM instead."
2,Californication empty shadow of earlier works,"I feel sorry for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It must be hard to keep up the energy and vitality and fire and emotion that exudes from Blood Sugar Sex Magik and other earlier albums. I can picture the musicians recording this album--particularly drummer Chad Smith--just beating away to yet another song with the same groove as 39 of their other songs. I believe that RHCP still want to innovate--and their skills are musicians are formidable--but this album is not the forum. There is nothing new here. It's still RHCP--Kiedis' focused, penetrating vocals will not disappoint--but the album lacks the freshness and punch of earlier works."
2,Terrible sound quality...,"I'd like to emphasize the comments made by some others about the awful sound quality of this album. I don't know if this happens on all the Californication CD's, but on mine there is a lot of extremely annoying static and hissing throughout most of the songs that just ruins them. It's too bad, since I think I would have really liked this album if only the recording quality had been better..."
2,Not as good as some of their other ones,"I am not a big Chili Peppers fan, but I do enjoy some of their songs. Although this CD has a couple of good ones, it is not their best. It's too soft for them."
3,Californication,"This band is pretty cool, I don't have this cd right now, but I do like the song ""Californication"" It's a lot better than that stupid scar tissue song the did last. But this, this song is coo."
3,Hi all!,"Hey, I haven't heard many songs on this cd, but Scar Tissue is definately one of my favorites!"
3,Cool but not the peppers,"This album is a decent rock album, but it's NOT the peppers, infact, to a genuine peppers fan, this sounds like a sell out. For something REAL (and utterly unforgettable) check Blood Sugar..."
4,A thing of beauty and grace... welcome back John!,"Took a few listens to adjust to the evolution, but well worth the time. Kickass harmonies and John's gut wrenching leads on the ballads make you want to cry. These guys still know how to nail a chorus - see Emit R. Flea has left a lot of the slap behind, but he loses nothing... still miss that trumpet flea! John is back and beautiful, thankfully. Anthony's vocal is better than ever. And Chad is still A ROCK. While I wouldn't put this in a class with the testosterone laiden Blood Sugar masterpiece or along side Axis or Ladyland it falls squarely in my top twenty. John Frusciante is still the only one who comes close to hitting me in the gut like Jimi. It's great to have this band complete again."
2,Navarro or Bust,"I don't like these guys without Dave Navarro. If you liked one hot minute, don't buy this. If you liked mother's milk and blood sugar, you might like this, though it's pretty mellow."
4,Great CD!,"I absolutely love RHCP. There music is unlike any others, and you can listen to their songs over and over again. I loved their last 2 cd's, and this one is no exception!"
4,Back with a fury.,"I have been a fan of the RHCP for a long time now and I have all of their records. I would have to say that this is their second best effort behind ""Blood Sugar Sex Magic"" (which was mind-blowing). This CD is excellent, and enjoys the complexity and freshness which lacked in ""One Hot Minute"". Do yourself a favor: get this CD (and don't just listen to 'Scar Tissue', you would be missing out on good stuff.)"
4,One of the greats,"Californication is no BloodSugar, but it is a great album. While it is filled with a lot of great tracks (Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, This Velvet Glove), it has tracks that really don't go anywhere (Get on Top, I Like Dirt). I really like the album, but its not going to hold up as a classic. The Peppers are still unique and this album is definitely worth listening to."
4,I'm Going to Try Not to Be Biased,"I've been putting off reviewing this CD for so long; I just didn't know exactly what to say. I don't really like this CD. I listen to it very rarely, and I just don't get very excited listening to it. Blood Sugar is my favorite Chili Peppers CD, and I don't think that's going to change. So why did I give this 4 stars? You just can't deny the fact that this is a well written album that shows a lot of emotion. I loved the all out energy and crazy funk riffs of Blood Sugar, but the songs on Californication show a lot of maturity and that whole ""less is more"" style. So instead of giving it 3 stars like I would have, I gave it 4 to show that it is a quality album. My personal favorites are Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top, Easily, and Purple Stain. So the best advice I can give is listen to it first. Borrow a friends or listen to the samples here."
5,RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS WILL ALWAYS RULE!!!!,As a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers I have enjoyed all their music. I believe this is a good cd and shows a more melodic side of the chili peppers. It is good to see them produce another hit album. It is also great to see the return of John Frusciante.
3,Mid-life Crisis Record of decent tracks.,"The CD starts off with a great change of tempo song (Around the World), but somewhat lets the fans down afterwards. I hoped that ""Scar Tissue"" was only a warm-up (but cute) radio single. Not the case!!! ""Californication"" has one great line--""Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging"". Good CD. "" ONE HOT MINUTE "" was better."
3,chili peppers aren't so red hot on californication,"i love the red hot chili peppers, john frusciante and flea are amazing. i've been listening to them since mothers milk, but they've lost something. i'm afraid to say it, but i think i have to, they've gone easy listening. several songs are great, but overall, it's just not up to their earlier stuff. i'd definitely recommend this album to any chili pepper fan and any top 40 radio addict. but if you're a chili peppers purist, stay away, this isn't your peppers."
1,Uggh,"I remeber liking this when I bought it, somehow....Nowadays I find it to be irritating CD which for some odd reason everybody likes, I think that came about when I started listening to CD's and records because they had something to give me, the Peppers don't.Nothing on this album has anything that I can relate to, and in fact most of the album is extremley irritating to me. So I can't say stay away allthough I can say I don't like it."
4,Defintely A Classic,"This is such a good cd.I love it! Instant Teen cLASSIC! oTHERSIDE IS A AWEZOME SONG! I was doing that< on purpose. Well... Anyways Scar Tissue, Otherside, Californication, Get On Top, and all these other songs are classics you should buy. This Cd is definitely in my Top 10."
1,Bad effects of drug abuse.,"Get into rehab--not the studio. They sound very, very tired on this. Same old ideas, rehashed, and Anthony just cannot sing anymore. As a former fan, I am disappointed! Also, they seem to have a real fixation on Mr. Bungle--they keep copying their musical ideas, but far too late."
1,They've lost it!,...this album is so bland and dull that it makes One Hot Minute sound good! Lyrics and vocals on this record are extremely painful to listen to... I want my money back!
3,They are coming up again from the stinking One Hot Minute.,"Ok, I am glad that they are finding themselves again, after their last album. But hey after Blood sugar Sex magic, the number one album of the century, it's hard to make anything on the same level after that. I am comparing, and always will. Sorry, but R.H.C.P are finished."
5,The Best CD of 1999!!,"It is the best CD I have ever heard. The best songs are Around the world, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue and Get on top. I reccomend this CD to anyone."
4,"Very good! Mellow, funky, and heartful.","1991's ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"" didn't impress me much. Sure, it has a few good songs on it, such as ""Give It Away"" and ""Under The Bridge"", but it's nothing special. I bought ""Californication"" because of ""Scar Tissue"". When I listen to it all, I was surprised to find that it was really good! Unlike ""Blood Sugar Sex Magik"", ""Californication"" shows that the Chili Peppers have hearts. Instead of Anthony Keidis' rambling on, he sings lyrics that have meaning. While still funky and grooving, ""Californication"" showcases the mellow side of the Chili Peppers. Who knew they had one? A very good c.d. I highly recommend it!"
2,Kiedis doesn't make the effort,"why 3 stars off?--the vox parts aren't carefully composed, they sound like the first blabla things that came to kiedis's mind. another star off for frusciante's uninspiring solos; yet another for rubin's bad job: a producer who, this time, could not squeeze a more exiting album out of this (still) supreme live band--he produced it too much for soft radios, perhaps. 2 remaining stars go out to eternal flea and chado who are still kickin ass to honour us. although there are some good songs (e.g. track 2), this album is nothing in the shade of blood sugar sex magik. even if you're a rhcp fan, i think there are better records by other artists out now to spend your money on. that was me, ciao."
2,Sobrevalorado,"En mi opinión es un álbum sobrevalorado. Es verdad que contiene muy buenas canciones (Scar Tissue, Around The World) pero otras son verdaderas bobadas (Road Trippin'). Con este disco los RHCP se establecen en la clase burguesa del r'n'r business, para desgracia de sus admiradores que nos gusta más su etapa más punky. Después de este vendrían otros dos discos incluso peores, By The Way y el insufrible Stadium Arcadium. Ahora entiendo los motivos de Frusciante para abandonar la nave."
3,Only a selected few are good,"I bought this recording last month. After I listened to it at first, I was dissapointed. But, I figured it would be one of those CDs that you like over time. Either this isn't one of those CDs, or this process is taking a very long time, because I only like 3 songs on this album: Around the World, Otherside and Get On Top. I bought this album because of Around the World and Otherside, and the only new song I liked was Get on Top, so, In my opinion, this album isn't all that interesting or as deep as their previous releases."
3,"it's ok, but just doesn't seem like the Peppers I know","It's a good cd, but what is up with songs like ""Scar Tissue""? What happened to the good ol' days, when they were pumping out cool songs like ""Give It Away"", ""My Friends"" and ""Aeroplane""?"
2,Fizzle Fry,"No, not the Primus cd ""Frizzle Fry"", this is my evaluation of this cd. Good songs but not BURSTING like they were on BSSM or Mother's Milk and not even CLOSE to Uplift Mofo Party Plan. They play some tof these songs on Lite FM. These guys are getting older with the music. Fishbone-Now there's a band that has been consistant for OVER 20 years! Longer than the Peppers (check you history before you debate me!). They are still great musicians but the Umph is gone. Last GREAT cd was BSSM. One Hot Minute was there downfall. Navarro is an average guitarist. They should have kept Arik Marshall. Just my opinion."
4,really good,"i love this cd, i think its their best they have ever done, plus they got the estranged john frusciante back, hes my fav guitarist. the best song on here i think is scar tissue.im giving this 4 stars only because of the song porcelain, i think its just crap,its slow and really quite boring, but if you can get past that then this album rocks. id also recomend their other albums ""mothers milk"",""by the way"" and ""bloodsugarsexmagik"""
2,Chili's what have you done?,"I am a major Chili's fan, they're probably my fave band, but this album majorly disappointed. It is lacking one of the essential things that makes the Chili's such a great band, Flea's Funky Bass. Where's it gone? This is in my opinion their worse album and I would advise fans who like their earlier stuff against it. It does contain some pretty good chill out songs and Anthony's lyrics are great, as per usual. But don't buy this get one of their other great albums instead."
1,What a waste of hard earned,"What a disappointment after One Hot Minute. Sounds like a feeble attempt at a late 90s BSSM. But hey, the radio likes so it can't be that bad ??!!??"
4,new pathways of funkyness,"Although this album doen't have the raw funkyness of alot of there earlyer stuff, it still rocks. The chilis have always been famous for new sounds and they have done it again! This is perfect for chillin to with a big spliff.My only question is why the hell did the put porcelin on the album???"
5,"Top heavy, good stuff nevertheless...","""Californication"" is top notch Chili Peppers, but the best tracks on the album are definitely in the beginning. 'Around the World' is one of the best openers ever, and it rocks hard. 'Scartissue' is a radio hit and so is 'Otherside', and 'Easily' is easily (sorry) one of the best tracks on the album. The title track is the best track and speaks of West Coast superficiality. The rest of the album is scattered and not very cohesive, but it includes a variety of different songs and some sound a little experimental. ""Californication"" was one of the most successful rock albums of the 90's and rightfully so. Highly recommended."
5,Lightning Strikes Again...Another Excellent Album!,"The boys from LA are back with another off-the-hook masterpiece. The album is laced with wild, creative, and intense music. RHCP have a blockbuster album with ""Californication"". Get it now, your ears and soul will thank you."
1,"Songs = good, vinyl = terrible","I love the songs as you can hear them on the CD. Beware of listening to the vinyl on a good HiFi rig, however, because it's awful. It's compressed, oversaturated, and just sounds awful.To be honest it's the same as Led Zeppelin on vinyl......love the songs, but the vinyl version either points out how terrible the recordings were made, or some other limitation in the process.Boo to Amazon for not differentiating the medium as the reviews are recorded (I doubt that 875 people reviewed the vinyl version). I would give the songs 4.5 stars but the vinyl 0 stars if it were possible."
5,RED HOT,"you have to get this CD! all of the songs are great! if you don't already have it, get it now!"
3,"Good, but doesn't touch 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic'","My title says it all. A good album but it just does not compare to the classic 'Blood Sugar Sex Magic'. 'BSSM' has stayed in my regular listening CD collection for 8 years now, but I can't see 'Californication' doing more than 2."
4,good one,"this is good Good GOOD!I`m on a par wi my son, in that we both love this, so there you go....a 15 yr old and a 34 yr old loving the same music!How much more proof do you need?"
5,"Great Music, Great Band","Red Hot Chili Peppers has some of the coolest songs such as the depressed ""Scar Tissue"" and ""Other Side"". There are also some songs with some great sound such as ""Around the World"" and ""Parallel Universe"". There are other great songs with cunning beats such as ""Get on Top"" and ""Easily"". Lyrics make sense and almost every song is enjoyable. One star for vocals, one for well written lyrics, one for guitar quality, one for great percussion beat, and one for one great combination to make a good sound. There is no good reason to rate Red Hot Chili Peppers with one star. I wonder those who underate RHCP have even listened to their music and did analysis on every song. GREAT CD TO ADD TO YOUR ALTERNITIVE COLLECTION!"
4,The best CD release of the summer,"In in my near 19 years upon this planet earth, I've never really been into the Chili Pepper's music enough to call myself a fan. Sure, when their songs have been on the radio, I'll listen to them, even turn them up louder than some other songs. It wasn't until I said ""what the heck"" and went ahead and bought ""Californication"" that I owned my first Pepper's CD. Now that I have listened to it repeatedly, I'm wondering why I don't own their earlier albums because everyone reviewing on Amazon.com says their past works have been better. Better than ""Californication?"" If they're better than their latest release, than they must be five star material, because I definately give ""Californication"" four stars as a new-comer Chili Pepper's fan. The CD rocks, rolls, soothes, and puzzles at times. It was well worth the $12.99 chance I spent on it. If you've been a Pepper's fan much longer than I have, I suspect you'll love this album. Or, at least like it a lot."
5,Excellent work of art!,"This new album is amazing. The RHCP have such an amazing style. They cannot be categorized by their first albums. They are able to switch the sound of their music and still have a wonderful album. Their other works are also excellent, but Californication is just amazing. Buy it now!"
5,Survival of the Fittest,"Too many early 90's band have failed to make an album worth listening to since '93. You know a band is good when they evolve with time. Blood Sugar Sex Magic was a great album, but thank god the Red Hots have never tried to duplicate it. Rather, they continue to grow and change while still retaining that certain something that is the essence of what makes the Red Hots a stellar band. I think this album is their best to date. My other CDs feel neglected--I have been listening to Californication non-stop since I first bought it. Californication is the first album that completely explores and exhibits the complete range of Anthony Kiedis' voice and singing style. In the past, I thought some of their songs excellent, and others only ok. On this album, however, they have finally reached their full potential. Every song is like a finely tuned engine--it not only runs, it purrs!"
4,Their second best!,"Well, we all new it wouldn't top BSSM, but it still totally rules! It's missing the rawness and power of BSSM but I'm not saying it's not powerful, just not as. John is wonderful on the album! Having him back says sooo much, he's such a big part of the band, OHM just wasn't the same without him, and I know that everybody really missed him and is glad he's back :) If it were a bit rawer and more powerful it would be a five star album."
4,"Fusciante, Rubin & the boys combine to make one exciting rec","Californication, the most recent Chili Pepper album is one of the most exciting records that has come around in a while. If this combination remains(Jon, Chad, Flea, & Anthony w/ Rick Rubin) for the duration of their careers, it can only get better from here. Scary isn't it?"
1,horrible!,they sing and play about peace and love! why? that's terrible! i don't like the vocals either!
4,Chilis return somewhat triumphantly on diminutive LP..,"It took me a second, but i eventually realized my beef with this album. Firstly, I'm way glad John is back-the band doesn't make much sense without him..but I had been listening to 'Mother's Milk' a lot, and contemplating that stupid, shirtless, bellowing frat-boy image that they had for years. It was funny and all, but it made the sensitivities of songs like 'Knock Me Down' and 'Under The Bridge' seem all the more profound.This album is more consistently downer, and while I dig that, I miss the 'good time boys', too. Regardless, the band is tighter than ever--Frusciante rocks with such a relaxed vibe, it seems that his solo exursions have mellowed him considerably. This album has its share of agressiveness too, and dead weight, but for being one of the most anticipated albums of the year (for me, anyway), it doesn't disappoint."
4,Positively awsome guitar work by John.,"On the whole this is an excellent album. The problem people may have is that it is not BSSM. Face it they have just got back together and while this album is very...very good, Their best stuff lies ahead. Pay attention as John slips you back into the early 70's with his Big Guitar sound reminiscent of Clapton, page , Hendrix. I did want more (quantity) of funk tunes..but there were several there. I loved Scar Tissue, Porcelain, Emit Remmus, I like Dirt, Savior and This velvet glove. Excellent Album...John is now on par with Lifeson, Page in my book..(not an exaggeration)"
5,It's a shame I have been ignorant of their music.,Were their music this good ever? Now I have to stick myself to the record store to search the history of their albums and listen to them all!
5,The best all around album I've heard in years.,"This is the best album I've bought in a while. My friend told me how good it was, so I traded in my new Pennywise album (which stinks!) for this. One of the best choices I've made in a while. Buy this album ASAP."
4,Dude,"I thought that the album was cool, and I like the old Chili Peppers stuff, but the new one is good, too. Very different, reminds me more of Under The Bridge, which is not bad, just different. I think that perhaps they might lose a couple of their hardcore funk fans in the process, but I think it is definetly worth purchasing.Peace"
2,Not So (Red) Hot,"As a Peppers fan since the mid-80's, this album left me slightly depressed. These might be the same guys who gave unsuspecting listeners audio whiplash with ""Uplift Mofo Party Plan"" and ""Mother's Milk,"" but you'd be hard-pressed to tell by listening to ""Californication."" Lacking in solid grooves, the songs tend to meander around from one style to another without much real energy. The mostly uninspired hooks are repeated ad nauseam, with little of the ""betchya' can't top this"" mini-solo interplay between Flea and Frusciante that gave earlier albums real spark. The Peppers seem to have realized that their core audience has mostly moved on, and the entire album has the tired sound of a once-relevant band that's trying to learn new musical tricks."
3,One Hot Minute 2,"The dirty little secret of this album is that the return of Frusciante hasn't really jelled yet. Scar Tissue and Otherside are strong singles, but not from the best band around. Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar both stand high above this record, not only for the strength of the songs, but mainly because of all the intangibles. Both of the 2 earlier records show a band that can conquer the world and say or do anything. Californication however shows a group in mid-life crisis (i'm sorry) - particularly with Anthony. The lyrics suffer - but the biggest flaw is with Frusciante who has failed to find the genius attacks and melodies that pepper Blood Sugar Sex Majik. The album is worth buying, but only because there is little choice for fans of good alternative. And if you don't have them BOTH buy Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Majik instead."
1,Sucked,This Cd is like all the others but diffrent words i like the band but they need some new tones
3,"Great listening at the start, but gets boring...","I gave this C.D. 3 stars because it does have good music but after a while it starts to get boring. Red Hot Chilli Peppers are great, it is just that you might want to cosider listening to the C.D. first a few times. Hope this review helped you!"
2,a couple stars for a couple of songs,"i hated this cd.i don't really know how else to put it. it can be really insightful at times, like in the title track 'californication', but just plain disguisting in others ('i like dirt' about licking people, 'purple stain' singing about menustration).it seems that even though the chili peppers are one of my favorite bands, their hits do not quite represent their real sound.the song 'scar tissue' sticks out sorely on this cd. and that is supposed to be their huge hit. eventually, it has played itself out for me.to avoid: 'get on top', 'purple stain', 'i like dirt', and 'emit remmus'.of note: 'otherside' (very good, but melancholoy), 'easily', 'around the world', 'californication'.the chili peppers are losing their spice."
1,flea is tight on bass,very boring album and run of the mill.i like maybe a couple of there songs but i'd take fishbone over them on talent alone.cuz aside from flea this group has wack arrangements so-so productions and who told anthony kedis that's singing?
1,Distasteful,"After being exposed to this CD repeatedly and excessively at work, all I have to say is... They stink. Same annoying lyrics, same annoying sound. Why couldn't they have just disappeared?"
5,The Chilis are finally back at it,"I bought Californication this past summer, when it was first released. And let me just say that I am one of the biggest RHCP fans around. I find Anthony's voice so catching and beautiful...what I find even better is knowing he is so intelligent in real life. As are Flea, John and Chad. They are all lovable, fun guys that make soul shaking music. I suggest listening to Californication, pay particular attention to the words. If any one of you has a chance to see them live in concert, let me just tell you they put on an AWESOME live show. That they can perform so well live just shows you how well they fit together. They are, like Yohanna said, ""one big mechanism"" they work together, they know each other to the core. And you can hear it in their music if you just listen closely enough."
3,Grows on you...,"I've never been a fan up until now.I heard Scar Tissue on the radio a couple of times and liked it so I bought the C.D. I am inpressed with most of the music although there are acouple of heavier track which I can take or leave.I really like Otherside which has just been released over here and is playing all the time.I'm glad that this band seems to be writing softer music as for me it was easier to listen to than their previous work.The lyrics?I don't know,they seem to be a bit strange and deep in parts but isn't that the Peppers anyway?Some pretty FUNKY sounds on here,I like what I hear.Impressive in most parts.I am converted and am now a Peppers fan!"
5,Spectacular,"When I first heard Scar Tissue, last year I didn't like it at first, but after about 15 weeks it became one of my favourite songs, When Around the World went to Radio, I decided I had to get this CD. I bought it and I was not disappointed. This CD is one of the best in my collection now. I bought BSSM and One Hot Minute after buying this CD and BSSM was close to as as good as Californication but not quite. This CD has so many amazing songs, Parallel Universe, Otherside, Scar Tissue, Get on Top, Saviour, ... This list goes on and on. However my favourite song would have to be the title cut which is just an amazing song, I like it even more than Under the Bridge. It is rare to find a CD that u can listen to straight through, but this is definitely one of them, all 15 tracks are very listenable, even #8 Porcelain which is very mellow grows on you. Well buy this CD if you don't already own it, I guarantee you will now be disappointed!"
4,VINYL REVIEW: Excellent VINYL!! Far better than the CD,"For those of you who think the CD sounds fine, you have questionable hearing! The CD version is possibly the worst atrocity of the digital age. This new vinyl illustrates that it didn't have to be that way. I can actually turn up the volume on the vinyl! It's still not great like the 4 LP version of Stadium Arcadium, but it's highly listenable compared to the crap on digital. Make certain to get the version with the blue sticker on the front proclaiming limited edition 180 gram vinyl 2 disc set. It is available via amazon.ca, but I don't know which copy Amazon.com ships"
3,Officially spicing it down a notch,"Despite a re-teaming of Frusciante and producer Rubin, the band is in a different space then when they recorded their arguably strongest disc BSSM. It is now about accessibility, radio hits, and selling records- in a way that still promotes the band as a unique entity but nonetheless nullifies much of their original potency in more chewable-sized conveniences. In the way they were able to get past their misfire OHM and open up the ears of so many new listeners with a consistently well put together product, Californication is every bit the comeback disc it was said to be, but those craving what made the band so zesty in the first place would sadly realize the end of that era was upon us."
2,Very Weak,"Aside from Around the World, Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, and Californication, this CD has very little to offer. It's just not fun to listen to lyrically and musically after song #6. Sound quality is very poor too. It distorts alot. If you're looking for another BSSM or Mothers Milk type cd, this isn't it. A step down from One Hot Minute."
2,Where have all these Peppers gone ...,"On June 7 I reviewed Californication-Import, which I have never heard; this review should be placed below ""Californication"", so I send it to you once more, this time more fortunatelly;For the whole day (July, 7th) while listening to this record, I've been asking myself if it's what I'd expected to hear. It sounds like it was the stuff which couldn't have managed on ""Blood Sugar..."" and has been postponed; but it is supposed to be a brand new stuff to compensate these 4 years of waiting! Neither heavy nor funky enough; sounds like an average grunge (!?) and will be soon forgotten. There are only few songs likely to remain - ""Around The World"", ""Scar Tissue"", ""Otherside"", ""Savior"" and maybe two more; elsewhere I feel like I'm listening to a band which plays keyboard only. So - don't look for the stuff like ""Apache Rose Peacock"" or ""Warped"" - you won't find it here.It's just the worst of their records!"
4,Simply Fabulous,"This album is one of the best albums the Chilli Peppers have done. If you like their old stuff, then you'll like this. As a plus, a few of their songs have a slightly different style, giving the album a bit of variety. It also shows off Flea's bass playing and Anthony's awaesome voice more than the previous albums (in my opinion, the best song is definetly ""Otherside"") BUY IT! IT'S WORTH IT!"
4,"Great CD, Poor recording quality","The CD is excellent, but I spent about 20 minutes crawling all over my stereo system looking for loose wires and such until I moved the CD and realized that some of the songs are not recorded as cleanly as they might be. This isn't enough to prevent me from enjoying the CD, but be fore warned when you crank it up!"
4,"Classic rock, with a twist","This band mixes classic rock with a new, hip style to create a really good mix of sounds and interest. If you like Scar Tissue or Californication, you should like most of this CD. I haven't heard their other CD's, but I hear they are all good. I can tell you however, alternative ppl will consider this a good investment."
5,AWESOME.,"this cd is SO good. you have to go buy it, every song on it is great. i can listen to the whole cd without skipping any tracks. ""All Around The World"", ""Emmit Remus"", ""I Like Dirt"" and ""Scar Tissue"" are my favorites.. GO BUY CALIFORNICATION!!"
4,More funky rock n'roll from the Chili Peppers,"Another fine album from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. My favourite moments from the album are ""Scar Tissue"", ""Otherside"" and ""Californication"". It misses out on a five star review because I feel it is not as strong an album as the sublime ""Blood sugar sex magik"" or it's predecessor ""One hot minute"" plus the fact that the word ""California"" seems to find it's way into almost every song!"
4,"BloodSugarSexMagik, Part 2.","A companion album to '91's ""BloodSugarSexMagik"", effectively wiping out their mid-90's album ""One Hot Minute"", which tanked commercially and critically. Certainly John Frusciante's return is a major factor in this album's success, as is Rick Rubin's consistent production. My one reservation is that the record is front-loaded: all the singles and strongest tracks appear at the beginning of the disc. Still, a solid alterna-rock album and one of their best so far, although not quite the classic that ""BloodSugar"" was."
3,OK CD,"This CD is alright, but the Red Hot Chili Peppers have some CDs that are much better. It has some really good songs, but I don't like the rest."
5,(none),i have nothing to say this album is just overwhelming every single person should own a copy of this album!
2,I am sorry guys...,"I really wasn't too impressed with this cd. The only songs I liked from it were the singles...""Scar Tissue,"" ""Around The World,"" ""The Other Side,"" and ""Californication.""I am sorry guys, you are a great band, but I didn't enjoy this cd as much as I thought I would."
3,"Good, but not RHCP","On its own, I guess this album sounds pretty good, and its got the kind of stuff that does well on MTV, but Californication is a disappointment to long-time RHCP fans. For example, when a person listens to Bloodsugarsexmagik, there are insane funk-rock songs that really make him want to get up and dance, stuff that makes the blood truly red hot. One Hot Minute was a bit softer, but still had some life in it. Yet this album is like listening to ""Under the Bridge"" in 10 different ways. These guys have a talent at writing ballads, yet what makes the Peppers so special is their funk rock, something that hasn't really been matched by any other band. ..."
4,Tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication,"I feel like a jerk for giving this 4 stars. You know all the praise and I definately feel that ""Californication"" and ""Otherside"" are some of the greatest the Peppers have done. Although after One Hot Minute and Blood Sugar Sex Magik this isn't such a bad album. Peppers fans should definately buy it. It's not the best they've done but it's good. And that's good enough to buy."
3,"Californication.... the RHCP, have they lost the edge?","The newest RHCP album, Californication has been met with rave reviews. Yet, I feel something is missing. I rushed out as soon as I heard it was coming, and placed my order. When I got it, I played it constantly for a while.But there's not that 'rock' edge to them anymore. They've toned down. No longer are they the cutting edge group who once made the CD 'Blood Sugar Sex Magick'.... now they're playing 'Around the world'.While I enjoy the new album, compared to their older stuff which I would give fives stars to any day of the week, I only give it three."
3,Just Didn't Do It For Me,"I wasnt hugely impressed with this CD. That doesnt mean its a bad CD. But its different. Its not quite Blood Sugar and its not quite By The Way. Its basically a bridge for their transition from rap rock to melodic rock. Some people would like the mix, but not me.This album actually has some good songs. Californication is okay, Around the World is okay, Scar Tissue is great... Its just that theres too many okay songs and not enough great ones. Therefore, although its not a bad effort, it doesnt keep me listening to the CD. At times I think it gets very boring. Its not hard at all. I often turn it on when I'm going to sleep. However, the CD would appeal to some people. Die-hard Chili Peppers fans should get it, and so should people who like not all that hard rock. Just be prepared for a different sound.Closing Comments:Are their lyrics meant to make any sense at all?"
4,Red Hot Indeed,"This is an album that won't budge from the Oz Top 10, and it's no wonder. It is full of variety and has some of the best guitar work on an 1999 album release. It has heaps of tracks too which is nice to see. Listen for gems such as 'Road Tripping' and the title track and you will be sold. The Chilli Peppers put on a mean show at the Big Day Out concert in Australia in January this year which highlighted the tracks from this CD."
2,2 stars dropped in the mastering stage,"The sound quality of this CD is terrible. Whoever mastered the album onto CD is a completely clueless idiot, it is far too compressed and there is digital clipping galore. Harsh and unlistenable."
2,"Good music, poor CD","The music is great but the CD sounds like full of static. I have tried it on several high quality reproduction systems with the same result. I don't know if this is a problem of this particular disc or it is just poor production revealed on a high-end stereo system. If I knew, I would not have spend the money."
3,Engineers RUINED this album.,"I am very angry at the engineering. This is by far my favorite album by RHCP, I love the music, but the engineering sounds like the range has been compressed a few dozen times. You can't turn the music up without hearing the voice clipping, the cymbals buzzing, or the guitar's clean distortion turning into nasty muddy sounds. The clipping in the voice is worst on the intro to Otherside.My last hope is that some day this will be remastered with less compression, until then, I advise you don't buy this album."
4,Coming Back in Better Shape,"I never really liked their material, but I decided to buy this CD anyway. I was never disappointed. Kiedis brought his voice to a new level. The songwriting got better than before. They were able to bring together their own funk sound with a new rock approach, which brings a great variety of styles along this album. It could have included a little less songs, considering some are not that great, but overall, this is really good material."
4,"4,5 stars. Their best album","According to my opinion this is their best album. Thats what i and some friends think about this album. Of course it is their most commercial album but its so damn good. Most of the tracks and especially the first 7 tracks are masterpieces, the rest are just good - and there is not a bad song. This album is in my top list cool albums with Fraky Stelay (I believe is very underrated album). A must for all people since you will like it."
5,A Red Hot Chili Pepperish Triumph!,"I am glad that the RHCP are back with one of their best albums out. I thought this CD was very worldly, where some songs were sad and some were up-beat and funky, and some are just like some songs from BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK. this is the sequel to BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK. they use wonderful chemistry on this album. making Californication serious and Porcelain seem dull. Good job, guys!"
4,The CD rock's the house!,"The best song on the whole track by far is #3, aka Scar Tissue. The rest of the songs are hard rock, not for woosies. This CD is awesome!"
5,Red Hot Chili Peppers Best!,This is the first CD of the Chili Peppers I own and it kicks! My favorite tracks are Parallel Universe and Scar Tissue. That's why I bought it is because of Scar Tissue. Over-all it's a fantastic CD and if your looking for something to listen without skipping tracks this is it.
5,Unique and Great Sound,"This CD is solid as a rock. It is great to listen to no matter what kind of a mood you are in. It intelligently combines songs with various beats, vocals, and instrumentals. The lyrics are also very good. This is a well-thought-out CD, and it seems as though a great deal of effort was put into it. It will appeal to many people. If you like any/all the hit singles ""scartissue"", ""around the world"", and ""otherside"", you will find a purchase very worthwhile."
5,Best Album of 1999,One the most beatiful album from R.H.C.P. and simply the best album for 1999. The sound of the band is perfect: rock together with great ballades. Welcome back Red Hot Chili Peppers !
4,Very California,"This Album is really good, a little too mellow for my taste. Not as good as Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik or Mother Milk, but it is a good effort. With the return of Frusciante the Chili peppers sound ""right"" again."
5,My kind of music,"There's nothing magic about it, Peppers did it again. It is an interesting result of personal (I guess) ""plain and simple pains"".(?)However, it catchs you. The guitar combain perfectly with the lyrics to form a new curiously true tone. Mainly, it is a search for the original self.I was surprised to hear the soft sound in 'Porcelain' it's almost a lullaby! drowsy and sweet.Personally I would buy this cd just for the guitar bits. I just love bass guitar work.Peppers are mature but hornier than ever. There's something in this cd that ""talked"" to me, it is an albom in a whole new level -> something other bands hope to grow to."
4,one of the year's best albums,"In this modern era of pathetic knock-off ""alternative"" rock (Matchbox 20, please...), the Peppers have returned and delivered one of the year's best records. Most of the songs have that ""Soul to Squeeze"", ""Breaking the Girl"", and ""Under the Bridge"" tempo (which, personally, I think is the Peppers at their artistic finest). ""Scar Tissue"", ""Otherside"", and ""Californication"" are some of their best songs ever and they will probably have some crossover mainstream success, but who really cares. What matters is that the band has gotten back to basics. John Frusciante was sorely missed. Loved ya Dave, but you belong in a Led Zeppelin tribute band, or at least with Perry and the rest of the boys in Jane's. This is a very mellow and soulful album. Kick back and relax and feel the vibe, and try to forget about the more embarassing moments of One Hot Minute."
4,Good Easy Listening.. but nothing to get the adrenaline fix,"Its a step back in the right direction, but lacks the rock they once had in '91. Its nice for a sunday drive. Im still a fan."
4,Interesting Life Story,"I received a signed copy of this book for free after seeing him speak for my high school. The novel was written very well, and the story was very interesting. It starts from before he was born, when his parents fled war-torn Vietnam, to his glory days with Texas A&M and the Dallas Cowboys. With his career finally over, this is a good note for him to leave on. As a casual fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this book."
3,This song is great!!!!,"This song is great! It has a great chorus! My fave part is when she's like: ""I've never been kissed, never been kissed, never been kissed-Like this"". It's just a great song all around. Plus, the video is cool, too."
3,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"THE BOOK WAS DESCRIBED AS VERY GOOD AND SAME AS DESCRIBED BY AMAZON....EVEN THOUGH IT ARRIVED QUICKLY, PAGES WERE UNDERLINED AND HIGHLIGHTED, AND HAD FRAYED AND STAINED EDGES. THE BOOK IS ABLE TO BE USED, BUT WASN'T HAPPY WITH DIFFERENCE FROM DESCRIPTION."
3,Be Careful What You Wish For,"Clothilde is a girl who lives in Maine in 1920. After her father comes home from the war disfigured and she has all these other problems on the home front, Clothilde takes a walk in the woods where she thinks she hears a voice telling her to share her wishes. Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for is what I think the point of this story is, but I'm not sure. This book is just okay, but not great."
3,What's the point?,"This tells the story of a girl in the years after World War I. Clotilde is a rather unlikable heroine. She has reason to be moody and dark however -- her father has come home from the war disfigured, her mother has withdrawn to be ""ladylike"", her brother has betrayed her family and gone back to his grandfather who is filthy rich, her best friend is fired from her job as maid. A mysterious Voice offers Clotilde the answers to her wishes. I'm still trying to figure out the point of this story. Most of Voight's other books seem to have points, this one just wanders around and nothing really is resolved at the end."
4,A good introduction to Bronze Age Britian,Four and a half stars.Certainly not the last word but a good effort in describing the artifacts (both individually and in situ) of Neolithic and Bronze Age and theories that the archeological record suggests. Nicely illustrated.Recommended
3,uneven,"I have used this book as my only XP reference for the past year and it is absolutely terrible. I bought it because of the Peter Norton name and remembering the ""Inside the PC"" book in the late 80s. I found myself constantly supplementing it's information with extended sessions in the bookstore and on the web. There are even some subjects that this ""complete guide"" does not even touch on (e..g remote desktop). Get another book, probably any book, for an XP reference.That said, there are about 200 pages in the middle of the book that make the purchase worthwhile. Part IV: Anatomy gives an excellent presentation of XP architecture, the Registry and file system. Buy it for this section."
4,"NICE BOOK, BUT WITHOUT ATTACHED CD-ROM","Designed for the intermediate users of Windows XP, this book, ""Peter Norton's Complete Guide to Windows XP"" is well-written and well-detailed.With the analyses that covered both the Home and the Professional editions of Windows XP, it contains every information any intermediate user of the software would need. However, the more acquainted a user of this book is with any of the Windows 9x editions, the easier he or she will find this book. Even power-users appreciate the helpful annotations that are found in most of the sections.But given the listed price of this book, it is a shame that Norton did not back it up with a CD-ROM. Nearly all comparable texts come with attached easy-to-use CD-ROMs, which serve as comprehensive e-books. And although that I still agree that this is a good book, I will say that its value for money ranks lower than those of many comparable texts that come with CD-ROMs."
4,A nice helpin' o' blues,"Earlier reviews have compared Guy Davis to Rev. Gary Davis, but this CD finds a gentle, rolling sound that reminds me of an updated Miss. John Hurt. There's a sweet undercurrent that keeps you tapping your toes, much like John Hurt's easy on the ears Delta blues. The only complaint I have is that Davis leaves us wanting more. CDs hold 78 minutes of music and, like so many others, this clocks in at about 45 minutes. The albums I grew up with (scratch, pop, skip!) ran 45 or so minutes. It's a shame that that length seems to be ingrained as the ""standard"" length of any ""long player."" Davis is so hot, so perfect for a summer evening, that I want more, more, more..."
4,Very good album!,"This album is great! And the two bonus remixes of ""Free Me"" are terrific (maybe even better than the original). This album has a very groovy/London/Bacharachy/Swingin' 60's-type vibe...if that makes any sense. My favorite songs are ""Maybe"" and ""Something So Beautiful."" And how cool that she actaully had a hand in writing most these songs!"
4,she can do better a review from kevin figueroa,she should of stood in the spice girls she has a good voice but not the voice that will make it big in the world
5,Great CD,This CD was great! I love the songs and the different sound and feel it has to it than other pop albums. Emma is very talented and shows it in this CD as well as her others!
4,HOW FREE CAN A BABY without SPICE BE ?,"EMMA BUTON takes a large gamble on this CD to record material that will remove herself from the giant media image known as BABY SPICE. This CD does make BUNTON mature as an artist. The good news is that the three first tracks on this CD are pure pop and possibly the strongest material on the CD. The track FREE ME is pure OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN. MAYBEE has a strong mindless hook that should go over well on TOP 40 in North America. Unfortunately, the bad news is that some of the material try to hard to land in the MOR arena and only falls flat, lacking any spark. The duo track with LUIS FONSI is a prime example of a track dragging a CD towards a low point. BUNTON has the media flair and vocal ability to launch a solid POP solo career. All she needs now is to locate the perfect producer with the right material. A good CD if you are a fan, but this sounds like an audition for better things to come."
5,Simply sweet,"I must admit that I'm a massive Spice Girls fan, but that's not what influences my opinion on Emma Bunton's second offering. Simply put, the music is beautiful, Emma's vocals--well, her voice has never been the strongest one among the Spice Girls, but it works perfectly for the musical style in this album. Overall, it's a mellow album, with a lot of tracks you can easily sing along to and make you feel gooey inside (particularly ""Tomorrow"")."
5,THE GREATEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!,"Maybe you remember Baby Spice back in the 90's,with her cute image and nice dresses and a super pretty smile.Now, forget about that and see a different kind of girl.The girl has grown up!!!.Not only in her singing, she's also wearing this sexy skirts and very, very tight short pants.The Cd, is great, the songs are going to transport you throught time until you reach the 60's and you'll enjoy the mixture of the past with sounds of the present.Each song is a delicate way of Emma, that tell us, she has grown up, but she hasn't forgotten the sweetness of a little girl, which doesn't mean she has lost her innocence.You'll hear Emma's sweet voice with the arrangement of the beautiful orchestra that goes very well with her.I think we need more of this to remeber that time maybe has gone by, but has left us a very beautiful heritage, the music, and Emma seems to understand that."
2,Very Disappointed,"This curtain does not come in the color as indicated. This color is more of a pinkish red with white flecks. ""Think accidentally throw this color curtain in bleach and you'll get the idea."" It even has a hint of gold. Reminds me of a tweed pink blazer. Unfortunately I bought red berry towels thinking it would match this curtain. If you buy it proceed with caution."
1,More colors than you think!,"I bought this hoping for a waffle like curtain. It has pink, purple, aqua, and white in the curtain as well. The picture and description is very decieving, making you think it is all blues."
3,SENT MINE BACK!!!!!,Let me start off by saying that this heater does warm my living room quite nicely but i found that i could not place it on a hard surface without it vibrating and making quite a bit of noise.It did seem less noisy when placed on a carpeted floor.For this reason and for the fact that when i knocked it over it did not shut down i am sending it back.I have now ordered the HZ-930 and i hope i have better luck.
5,Heat Express Heater Fan Works Great!,"I have been using this heater in a small finished basement room, where it's usually very cold! The heater heats up the entire room (not just the space in front of it) very quickly and very comfortably. The controls are great - very easy to adjust the amount of heat being given out. I recommend it, especially for small to medium rooms. I honestly have not used it in a large room yet."
5,Great so Far.,So far I've been using this on and off for about a month and I have no complaints. It works great for a small heater and the price matches as well.
2,Buy something else,"I've had this chair for 2 months now. It broke after the first month. Contacted KidKraft and customer service was good and sent me replacement parts. However, when the replacement parts arrived, part of the hardware was defective and I could not reassemble the chair. Contacted KidKraft again and they sent a hardware packet... of the wrong parts. I was able to reassemble the chair cobbling together hardware from the broken parts and the new hardware. However, I was forced to remove the defective hardware part and that area remains unsupported with no hardware at all in the chair. I hope that it is okay enough to last through baby's first year. If I had to do over again, I would drive for an hour to buy Amish."
4,"""you attach your own MDF or wood""","note information I could not find on Amazon, from Bench Dog: ""A tall fence is very useful for vertical raised panel work as well as sliding dovetails. Our ProRiser(tm) Fence Riser Kit (40-013) contains brackets to which you attach your own MDF or wood."" I mistakenly expected to get the MDF shown in the picture, not really that big a deal, but a minor surprise."
2,diapointed,When I sent for the item I didn't know you had to make your own fence and this was only a clamp.
5,GREAT BOOK!!,"What can I say about ""PUFF""? He is ""MAGICAL"".At first my granddaughter wanted no part of the book or DVD, but once I got her to sit down to read & watch (what can I say) she fell in love with him. Now she watches it at least 3-4 times a week & reads the book every day.I remember so well when they band the song (idiots), I'm 66 & love it.Thanks for all the magic it has brought to her.Sincerely,Rose"
2,A worn out book,The book was worn out in some sections more than others but this was to be expected from a used book.
3,Good quality but,I purchased this machine with table to string racquetball racquets. Being a two point hold down system and racquets of other shapes than a tennis racquet you will find the hold downs not adequate. Also when you mount your racquet for racquetball the throat strings are very hard to thread since the hold down blocks your view. I improvised on this and now use a J type clamp with a glued on rubber washer to grip the handle of the racquet. I am now working on a method to improve the hold down capability of this machine. Overall a well built machine but definitly not designed to string racquetball racquets! you can but at times this machine will frustrate you. Stick with tennis racquets with this equiptment and you should be OK!
4,First String Job - Minimal Glitches,"Even after I bought the klippermate, there was a lingering thought that I wouldn't be able to pull off a restringing job. But once I started off, there was no looking back. The guide book is really helpful and detailed. The steps are broken down into easy digestible portions. And the klippermate works as advertised. The only downside was the knot part, where the recommended place to tie the knot on my Wilson k-surge was not correct. I had another racquet, so I just referred to that for the position of the knot. But rest of the experience was really great, and looking forward to more restringing."
5,Great Viewing,"This Dvd is perfect for your Tractor loving child, Full of information and facts it will keep them entertained for a long time"
5,My grandson LOVES this DVD,"Highly recommend for any child who is enthralled by tractors. Well made and includes other interests such as 4-wheelers, farming, animals. The first time my grandson watched this, he barely breathed he was so into watching it. Great purchase"
2,Should be called the 'Copy-Paste-o Guide to Dogs',"The book isn't terrible, but the ESS specific parts are very short. Most of the book is written and re-used across the entire 'Healthy happy pet' series. The pictures are pretty bad - and overall the information is generic. Plus, the reviews by 'A Customer' look pretty clearly written by a publisher/editor, etc."
3,English springer Spaniel,"We gave this book to our son who had just acquired the dog from a neighbor who did not want him. He says the book is very helpful, he intends to be a responsible dog owner. I have not seen the book."
5,an excellant beginner instrument,"Nice finish, well machined. all slides and valves were smooth and easy. A good value as opposed to shelling out rental fees, or buying the expensive units offered by my local music shop. I expect he will learn on this unit for a few years before we will trade him up to a better instument My son is really enjoying his new instrument."
5,A real treat to read,"Mr. Buchan's knowledge of Persian culture and literature shines through ""word by word, meaning by meaning,"" in this enchanting novel.This is by no means an easy book to read, neither in terms of the writing style, nor in terms of its content. The writing style is beautifully complex and poetic, mysterious. One has to really savor the passages. I wanted to read some of the sections over and over again because they are written so beautifully.In terms of the story, although it is fiction, the context is very real and conceivable. The trials that John Pitt goes through to become reunited with his wife, are not far from the truth of what real people have gone through in that corner of the world. Sections of the story can be sad, but still this book is a real pleasure to read; a tender love story to remember for a long time, with a refreshing writing style, definitely outside of the ordinary!"
1,Could not get through it,"For what it is worth, I very, very rarely stop reading a book mid-way though, but I found the story so hard to follow, the characters so false and/or uninviting, and the writing so awkward that I put it down after about a hundred pages."
2,A White Guy's Fantasy,"I found this book very difficult to read, as the story is not realistic at all. As the author lacks enough knowledge and understanding of the Iranian culture and its sub-cultures, he fails to develop the characters appropriately. For example, he portrays the General as a very religious man. For those who are familiar with pre-revolution Iran, know this well that it would be next to impossible to find a religious high ranking officer (let alone a General). There seems to be too many coincidences. The whole story seems to be more like a white guy's fantasy about going to an exotic place, developing a sexual relationship with a beautiful underage girl and act as her hero, than like a real story. My advice to all of those who would like to cash in on the exotic places such as Iran is, at least, do your homework."
4,Like a dream,"I started this book one evening and I never stopped reading until I finished it. It reads like a dream, especially the first third or so which is the best. Some other reviewers mentioned prejudices about Iran: Hey! it is about one man and one woman and what happens between them. It reminded me of Ada by Nabokov."
2,Culturally inaccurate,His story is full of cultural inaccuracy. His perceptions are mostly based on the western stereotypes that don't reflect much true knowledge of Persians and the Iranian culture. It lacks character development and his characters are not at all real to an informed reader.
3,Disappointing.,"At best an unusual read, lending a perspective to little known social realities in Iran. At worst it is a very boring book, which promises much but delivers little. Well written but the storyline is pretty thin and very unexciting."
1,More Prejudices,"This book should not be read by anyone more than the author: It is awfully abundant with Western anti-Islamic prejudices about Iranians and Iranian women, from the front cover to the final sentence. My verdict is negative: 1 star is even to generous."
1,Enormous disappointment,"I'm told this book was ""hailed as a masterpiece in Britain"" and that it has been compared to Doctor Zhivago, so it sounded like a wonderful reading experience. However, I have to agree with others here who said they found it to be unreadable. Buchan does a poor job of clearly describing much of anything. The prose is disjointed and confusing and the story jumps around in time and location without adequately explaining any one of those times or locations. It is almost unheard of for me to quit reading a book before finishing it, but I gave up on this one very early on because it utterly failed to grab me on any level. There are some truly great works of fiction out there that will capture you and hold you from cover to cover. Unfortunately this is not even close to being one of them."
4,A wonderful spiritual journey,"In this book, you experience the spiritual journey that the main character goes through because of his love of a woman. This is told against the backdrop of the geopolitical situations in the middle east from the seventies to the nineties. I experienced what felt like a lifetime within the pages of this book."
3,"Gorgeous, but ultimately disappointing","This novel starts off with great promise, with an interesting, coherent plot, intriguing characters, and truly beautiful writing. It would be worth reading at least the first half of the novel just to appreciate Buchan's mastery of the language. Unfortunately, the novel peaks halfway through. I wasn't thrilled with the abrupt shift in the narrative, but I might have been less disturbed by it had the second half of the book at least been written with as much clarity as the first half. Everything was less convincing, perhaps because it all became quite confusing. Also, I found the ending quite vague and unconvincing - it certainly doesn't stand up to everything that preceded it, if the novel is meant to be a ""modern epic"". Still, Buchan gets full marks for his attention to detail,and for his ability to create sumptuous, atmospheric prose."
5,"This is a must have CD, period!","Using vintage instruments and a beautiful concept this albums delivers all you canexpect from such a mammoth project.The editorial review falls short !! this is a monster CD.I just can wait for ""The odyssey"" another project on the works with even better bandsand a concept that must satisfy every listener."
1,How did this guy ever get published,"While the story itself is a good idea, the execution is awful. This author cannot write. The cliches, the awkward sentences, the forced dialogue . . . it took everything I had to finish the book . . . and then return it. I was not going to allow my students to read writing this bad; it goes against EVERYTHING I have been trying to teach them."
2,maybe it's because I hate small town mentality,"There's nothing like having a couple of Natural Lights at the local dingy bar and then going home with the chain smoking older woman from work. Yeap, that's life allright, well at least to Tim Temples it is. From the very beginning I could not relate to the character whatsoever. There is the arguement that I am of the different gender, but even with that, Tim seems more like a girl than his love interest, Helena. Throughout the entire novel, none of the characters were fully developed, and seemed to be exact portrayers of small town cliches. You have the baseball-star of a father, the drop-out older brother, the hot/geeky girl next door, drinking buddies, and of course the older woman at work with a huge rack. The author tries to move along the story, and show development, but he is unsuccessful and fumbles at every turn."
5,"Funny, Charistmatic, Memorable","This is by far one of the best books I have ever read!It is humerous, insightful, and very memorable. It is easy to read, informational and introspective.I have read it three times already!"
3,"a ""Run On"" sentence","As a huge Moby fan, I was tremendously exited to see this disc on the shelf at the local record shop. Two singles that I had seen elsewhere combined on one CD for a relatively cheap price. Unfortunately, when I got it home, I was kind of disappointed. Aside from Moby's mixes, the other remixes were not anywhere close to the brilliancy of the source material. Neither Sharam Jey's or Aphrodite/Mickey Finn's mixes could hold a candle to the originals. The only new tune ""memory gospel"" is pretty good, a nine minute meditation that would have fit right in on Play, maybe towards the end. I'm not saying that there's anything seriously wrong with this single, just that it seems Moby may want to pick and choose who he lets tamper with music more carefully next time, perhaps opting to do it himself (he usually does it best anyway)."
4,Exceptionally good,"Moby has outdone himself with this release. I admit that I don't like the Aphrodite and Mickey Finn mix, but it makes the perfect lead-in song to the Run On extended mix. If you have a chance, the best mixes/remixes of both these songs are from the live concerts when Moby goes on tour. The 118 Mix is highly recommended, because it adds a fast element to the quasi-blues of the original song.The other songs are very good, and Memory Gospel is a wonderful song I fell in love with that should have been in the Play album."
3,I rate this Windham Hill lower than the rest,"I am a huge Windham Hill fan, but this CD just doesn't do it for me. Just not your typical Windham quality kind of music."
4,It was pretty good,it could have used more info(More! More! Tell me the answers to the mysteries of the universe!) and their was an error or two. I liked it in general
5,Honest and Straighforward,"When I became more interested in Judaism (as a secular Jew with almost zero connection to/knowledge of Judaism), I bought this book. Although it is written for converts, it has a knack for succinctly explaining 'what Judaism is', as opposed to fundamental Jewish beliefs, etc., and I would reccomend it to anyone exploring issues of Jewish identity. Particularly useful was a section detailing the experiences of various converts, which were all very different and sometimes provocative.I eventually did Geirus under the London Beis Din (as there were issues with my lineage). This was one of my treasured books, and from time to time I reread it to remind myself of the point of it all."
3,An important read for all converts,"As one who has recently converted to Judaism, I would recommend this to all those considering conversion to Judaism, no matter what pathway they have chosen to follow. This book covers conversion to Orthodox Judaism and is somewhat derisory about any other path to join this wonderful spiritual home. However, the realization of the exclusivity and lack of tolerance of Orthodox Judaism towards other sincere Jews is important for all converts to appreciate, even if it is difficult to understand. From that point of view, this book is a good starting point."
1,"Flimsy, Orthodox Propaganda","Maurice Lamm's book BECOMING A JEW ought to be entitled BECOMING AN ORTHODOX JEW. Lamm's condescending attitude towards non-Orthodox expressions of Judaism is grating and tedious. He presents the spiritual journey undertaken by Reform and Conservative converts as inauthentic. Perhaps it should not surpise anyone that a man who has consistently worked to deny Reform and Conservative converts full political rights in Israel takes such an intolerant view of the non-Orthodox, particularly the non-Orthodox ger. For a more balanced view of conversion, look at Dr. Epstein's book, and Lydia Kukoff's. Avoid BECOMING A JEW at all cost."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book for every convert or anyone thinking about converting to read. It has lots of information and it is well organized. It really gives a great overview of Judaism. Get it, read it!"
2,I agree: it is biased toward Orthodox Judaism,"Although the tone of the book is welcoming and reassuring to those who are seeking to learn more about conversion, it became clear to me that the message is that if you are going to convert, you better do it ""right""; that is, to convert to Orthodox Judaism is the only way to be accepted by the religion/community, to ""prove"" that your intentions are sincere, and to guarantee that your conversion is universally accepted. The book has great value in describing the whole process of conversion, but readers must understand the bias toward Orthodox Judaism."
1,Not Good,"This was my families third trip to Costa Rica, we found this book interesting, but not useful. The information on prices and hotels is old. I certainly would like to know that last time the writer actually vistit the country. His observations or opinions of quality of hotels certainly should be questioned. As well, as his ability to judge the communities. It seems like the writer has not been to Costa Rica in a long time. That goodnes we have traveled the country three times, each time with new guide book, this time, just a bad choice. Thought that anybody interested in traveling to Costa Rica should know, this is a good reference for background, but do not count on it for accurate descriptions of hotels or the communities."
4,Great Book!,"Hi, I am working at ILISA, Spanish Language Institute in San Jose, Costa Rica and I just want to let you know that this book helps our students a lot by making travel plans and by getting their way around in Costa Rica. Thanks!"
1,The talent and mentality of junior high boys.,"This was all the rage when I was in high school in the mid 80's and I can remember it vividly, though my copy ended up in a used CD/Tape shop in Sioux Falls, SD. As far as the sound and musical quality, these guys were total posers and couldn't hold a candle to some of the real ""Metal"" bands like Slayer, Venom, King Diamond, etc. And the lyrics are the stuff of zit-faced, date-less, early teen boys with nothing better to do then read their father's Penthouse Letters and imagine up their own little fantasy session. To put a warning on the lyrics is almost a waste. To get an idea string together numerous derogatory names for females, add in a couple nasty swear words and then finish it off with slang descriptions of very lewd sex acts and you have the Mentors. Oh yeah, set it against the backdrop of the worst metal garage band you've ever heard to complete the experience. El Duce, say high to G.G. Allen while you're down there."
4,Great Book,"This book gives some great ideas of how to work with various voice problems with children and adolescents.I would have liked to see more facts about things such as the average fundamental frequency for a child's voice as well as normal pitch range, etc."
2,There was not a quality check done on this one.,The snap does not work. It will not snap together. The hole is too large and there is not anything to hold it together. I used scotch tape to hold it together. Some deal!!
4,"Very Good, Lacks Great","Sheriff Tilghman was an outstanding and long-standing lawman in the late 1800's through the turn of the century, but very little is known of him. Wyatt Earp stole the spotlight. This story, Outlaw Kingdom, shares terrific history of outlaw gangs in the newly-opened territory of Oklahoma, and the endless hard work Bill Tilghman put into breaking the gangs."
4,No Ted Logan here!,"Keanu Reeves really nailed down this part as a Harvard bound, high school quarterback who leads a group of vigilantes in the mid 1980s. Kieffer Sutherland also stars but has nothing much to do but steal Keanu's character's girlfriend. This movie is a must see for Keanu fans."
1,Not for Kiefer,If you are planning to buy this because it may look as if Kiefer is a main star then DONT. I was extreemly disapointed to find that he was only on this for less than ten minutes total. Billy Zane was in it more.Apart from that I felt like I should smack myself over the head with the remote control every five minutes just to keep myself sane. It was very boring.
3,Kiefer babe!,"Movie would have been better if Kiefer had a bigger part. He was great, though and the movie is now part of my collection of Kiefer movies."
2,"Pharisaism, Legalism continue in the 21st Century","Thieme is a great linguist, a great categorizer; however, his theology is suspect. He advocates, and sustains the cult of Thieme -- only he has the truth, only he knows the orthodox interpretation of Holy Scripture! Wrong! As he himself would say, ""Jesus Christ controls history, not R.B. Thieme, Jr."" Thieme sustains Pharisaism: only by listening to his teachings can one attain ""super-grace."" The term does not even exist, except by extrapolation, in Scripture. Mankind is responsible for human suffering -- not God. For ""God is love.""Get a clue!!!!"
3,It gets better,"This book did not meet my expectations. Having said that it's not terrible either. It starts off slow & rambling but still readable. It gets better halfway through the book although I expected it to be funnier.With so many great books out there I can't recommend that you part with your hard earned cash & purchase this. If on the other hand you really want to read this, I suggest borrowing it from the library."
2,"Brilliant Wit Wasted on a Weak, Painfully Slow Plot","Stephen Fry's brilliant wit and word craft is on full display in this very boring book. As much as I love his clever use of languang (""handkerchief pandkerchief"", ""dribble of three-act loose-stooled effluent"", ""arse-paralysingly drear times""), the plot is weak and drags on far too long. The protagonist, with his vile wit, is the only character I enjoyed. The other characters were plausible but just plain uninteresting.Read this book only if you truly love Fry's wit and banter."
2,for those captivated by oversexed males,"It was funny in parts, but must we spend (how many pages?) exploring the consequences of oversexed males of a variety of ages, both gay and straight? And though I grew up in Utah, I am not Mormom, (nor am I a fundamentalist Christian), and have read almost all of Philip Roth. It's not the sex, it's the single focus."
4,Well done but no lid,"I would give it a 5 star however it doesn't come with a lid, which would be extremely helpful as I use this when we camp."
3,Only Lasted About A Year,"Bought this in May 2011 and have used a couple of times per month since then. Everything seemed to be holding up well until one of the handles ripped. Note that it did not detach where it was sewn to the bucket. The handle material itself ripped away at the seam. Still useable with one upper handle, but who knows for how long."
4,Adequate to the task,"I use this in conjunction with my leaf blower/vac. It's not the greatest thing ever, but it does the job better than a rigid sided trash can does since it allows the vac to ""breathe"". As a combo with the vac, it beats the heck out of the little white leaf collection bag the vac came with since I can line this thing with a full sized leaf bag and then just tie off the top and dump it. No bending and stuffing of leaf bags needed. If you need a light-weight, easily storable receptacle useful for light duty yard work. This is will get the job done."
1,This doesn't work with the hose / attachment - both are useless,"Stay away from it and just use the shoulder bag. The hose easily gets clogged, and since it is very long it is tedious trying to clear it."
3,Dissapointed,"Ordered this container based on the ""43 gallon"" size-unfortunately there were no dimensions given. This is exactly the same size as a ""40 gallon"" that I had previously purchased from another manufacturer. The only reason why I purchased the Toro is because I thought I was going to get a larger container. Quality is fine."
5,"Useful, sturdy","I purchased 2 of these ""buckets"". I use them in the shed, not the yard. We have trash collection every 3 weeks. Used with a LARGE plastic liner, they are PERFECT. The bottoms are ventilated so there's no chance of moisture building up under the plastic liner. No reason why they wouldn't be great for yard work, also. Excellent bargain!! Heavy-duty, with handles."
5,Very Sturdy,Great lawn leaf bag. Very big & holds a lot of leafs. Sometimes a little tricky getting it to fold back down because it is made with such sturdy material. But it has lasted quite a while for us.
3,Smaller than expected,"This item is very well constructed and sturdy, however it was much smaller than I expected a 43 gallon size would be."
4,GreatBucket!,"This is a nice bucket. I use it when I am gardening, trimming trees, etc. I didn't give it 5 stars because as you fill it up, if you've lined it with a trash bag/leafbag, it tends to be a little difficult to get the bag out without tearing. Other than that, I think it's fine. I have purchased two of these - one for me and one for my mom!"
2,"Strong concept, weak handles!","Love the concept - light, collapsible for storage, easily adapted to leaf vacuum. But when I picked it up to dump the VERY FIRST LOAD into our compost bin the handle just tore off in my hand! Because Amazon sent this item in a ridiculously large box (about 6"" x 36"" x 48"") when it could have fit into a box the size of two large pizza's, and I had already recycled the box, now it will be a big hassle to return it so I'm stuck with defecto, just waiting for the other handles to come off."
3,"construction excellent, size questionable","I ordered this ""43-gallon"" container and Fiskars 30-gallon gardening container at the same time. Side by side the Fiskars container is the same diameter and a little taller than the Toro! A 33-gallon trash bag fits nicely in either, so I suspect the Toro measurement is an overestimate. The Toro does have superior construction."
3,Toro 29210 Spring Bucket,"We just received two of the Toro 29210 43-gallon Gardening spring buckets. They are sturdy,well made, and we are going to keep them, but they are not 43 gallon buckets. The buckets are approximately 30 gallon containers, or perhaps 34 and the numbers were transposed. We specifically ordered these as opposed to the other spring-buckets because of the size. The actual product received does not state the ""gallon"" size but simply dimensions. The error is in the description on the website. Nice buckets but not 43 gallon buckets. We would love to find 43 gallon buckets if anyone does actually make them."
5,Toro 43 gallon bucket,Great product I use for carting leaves and twigs. Especially like the collapsesable feature with snap in buckle straps which makes easy storage.
3,"Gardening Bucket, the heavies","Very good size and ""endurance"" construction. Would have liked to know its' ""empty weight"". Wish it weighed less, as once it is filled up it's going to be quite heavy, which defeats one of the main reasons I purchased it. I used to have a similar one that was was considerably lighter, while still being sturdy."
2,The old style bag liners are better,"I have been using a Lawson Products Easy Bagger for years and prefer it. It goes inside my plastic bags, is easy to remove, has no fabric on which mold and mildew can grow, and is less than half the price. Hard to beat the Lawson Products Easy Bagger."
5,toro spring bucket,"Absolutely love this product. Spring form stays in place for what ever you may be using for..leaves outside, gathering garbage after first putting waste liner inside spring form. Durable, cost effective compared to other products, a name you can depend on. I would recommend this product."
5,Gardening Bucket,This is second bucket I have ordered. I tore a hole in the first through heavy use/mishandling and was lost without it. Makes handling garden and yard cleanup a snap.
1,I don't get it,"This bag is very pretty and nicely made, but I don't get the idea of how to use it. It has a hard time staying up (the spring needs to be a little stronger). But that wasn't really a problem. Pulling a loaded bag out of it is really hard to do. I have been using a plastic garbage can with some holes drilled in the bottom (lets the bag come out easily) and costs much less. Storage is nice on this, but if you can't use it to do what it's supposed to do why store it! I'll take a plastic garbage can any day.Jack"
1,"hose pops out,thing tips over","hose pops out,the thing tips over.I had to use a giant hose clamp to hold it on then the bag finaly blew off the tub."
1,makes extra work,"It's a nice bucket but its way too big to fit a trash bag over the edge and if I can't do that, so that the leaf mulch ends up in a bag, I have to do the extra work of bagging the mulch out of it. I could have done that without spending the money. I want my money back!"
4,Nice & Easy to Store,This has been a great addition to our yard maintenance equipment. It's light so easy to move and great to store.
3,"Good product, but does NOT have a shoulder strap","This is a nicely constructed product - looks like it will last for some time. As the other reviewers have said, it is a very handy tool to have for yard cleanup, and it collapses down quickly and easily for storage.It does NOT, however, come with a shoulder strap as noted in the photo and description. I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived in fine shape, was 100% new and unused, but no strap! I returned it, and re-ordered another. The replacement also lacked a strap. The product info sheet that comes with the item makes no mention of a strap, so I imagine Toro stopped including one to save costs.The lack of a strap is not a deal-breaker for my purposes, but it would be a handy addition. If you order one, keep in mind that you will not get the strap."
5,Good Stuff,These are excellent receptacles for leaves and other yard debris. Sized just right to hold about as much as you can carry away. They're still new but appear to be well made and should last a good while.
2,Toro,"Very disappointed in this Bucket, it doesn't accept the refuse bags. I have a stantard 30Gal garbage can that works better with the bags. You dont need this if you have to vacuum the leaves into the container and then try to get into your refuse bags. What a pain in the bag!"
4,A hit at the recycling center,"Nice size for me to fill and still move around the yard, handles are well placed. Like the collapsible feature for winter storage. Only wish it had a cover to keep brush from getting in the back of the car if it tips. Otherwise, it's great."
3,Gardening Bucket,Its a great concept with the collapsible style storage. After expanding it to full capacity it appears to be on the short side for a decent size garbage bag to fit inside. For me a foot taller would have worked out better.
3,"Great product, but lacks an important feature...","So far everything is working great with the bag. I'm very impressed with the durable construction of this bag. I isn't as tall as I thought it would be but after filling it just over 2/3 full with grass clippings, it is fairly heavy.The only thing that I would have liked to see added to this is a zipper top. As you probably know if you don't dispose of the clippings immediately they will start to smell really bad. A zipper top would help out in many ways with the smell and also the ability to store it outdoors even when it's raining, but without that zipper top my options are limited. So I would recommend to other costumers to look for one with a zipper top."
4,Excellent Starter Paddle,"I bought this paddle because i wanted to have my own paddle and did not want to share with anyone. This paddle is light, rubber is nice and sticky and it also has some power. This is a great all around paddle for beginner to intermediate players."
2,What happened to the last 6 years?,"The Video is good, dont get me wrong. However, the problem is, the video did not cronicle his matches against the likes of Hulk Hogan, Jake Roberts,the fake Undertaker, the first ever casket match against Kamala, the ugandan giant (one would think that would be a good thing to add with an undertaker video and all). The heavy focus on the last two years and the total omission of his Title reigns was a terrible thing for the WWF to do, seeing as how his career is 8 years and counting"
2,"Undertaker's ealier career is RIP, by this tape at least","For those that saw the Undertaker in his debut at the 1990 Survivor Series and have followed his career, this tape will be a disappointment. The tape starts off recaping the Taker's feud with Mankind, LEAVING OUT his Survivor Series debut, his first title reign, his casket matchs with Yokozuna and his match with the pseudo undertaker. The tape then jumps from the 1996 Mankind feud to his feud with Shawn Michaels in 1997, skipping over his title reign, not to mention his performance in the 1997 Royal Rumble and Final Four IYH. Kane's feud to the present is recapped however, and the highlights shown make the matches look a lot better then some of them really were. In all, the footage shown make for an enjoyable viewing, but the tape fails to correctly show the transistions the Undertaker has developed during his 8+ year career in the WWF."
4,Undertaker: The good old days,"This is a great video, one of my wwf favorites. It features the Undertaker as he was on the dark side and goes through many of his best matches. It features matches such as hell in cell with HBK, Kanes arrival, and the inferno match to name a few. If you liked the undertaker in the Dark side then I suggest this video. Overall this is a highlight video of him. The only problems I have with this DVD is that it lacks any bonus extras and that there are no chapters to skip through the DVD. Basically if you have a VHS player save yourself the money since the DVD and the VHS are about the same but if not it's worth the trouble to find The Undertaker: The Phenom on DVD."
2,Undertaker The Phenom,"Slick productions values circa 1998, beyond that its not worth the money unless you are a die hard Undertaker fan, not the best video the WWF as come out with, but in todays world it is a classic."
1,Another waste of money,This tape doesnt show you anything good except foe some garbage that they showed on tv. I dont think its worth 13 dollars
5,this is a great video,"I have this video, it's great. It shows the boiler room brawl, buried alive, hell in a cell, and much more. If i wee you i'd order it now"
3,Not so good video!,"If you want to know the Undertaker, you should buy this one. But if you have already known him well, you do not have to. For example, this video does not cover some of his very important matches after 1996 such as those with Diesel, Hitman and Sid, etc. Besides, I actually expected his personal interviews, in order to see his real wrestling attitude with his real words he had taken a couple of times before on TV. Further, emphasis on wrestling with Kane is too much for me. Overall, I think the editor of this video did not take time to create. If you respect him, I am sure that you can and have watched his wonderful scenes so many times more on PPV and RAW."
4,Big Boy Pete - 'Summerland' (Gear Fab),"Nifty fourteen track collection of Big Boy Pete's work. These tunes were penned and recorded between 1966-68. Personally, I consider Big Boy Pete to be under-appreciated British psychedelic pop. Cuts here I liked best were the Beatles-like ""The In Things"", ""Time Has No Meaning"", ""Forget Me Not"", the trippy ""Peter Pan"", ""Listen Girl"" and ""Oh Miss Halliday"" (reminds me of the Monkees) - which is a good. This is like the third CD by this long standing artist I've heard. Does anyone know if he ever tours? Believe he's still among the living. His music is fun to listen to."
2,Another Re-Visionist Take: Given as Fact,"One of the strongest arguments against Celtic Shamanism is that the only way for it to really work one needs to re-write the history and culture of the people. That is exactly what happens in this book.Much of what we have learned about the Anceint Irish through historical research, archeology, and comparitive mythology is simply thrown away to make room for the authors personal vision and desires.If your into special pleading, poor research, and personal vision given as fact than by all means, this is the book for you."
4,Nice story,"Oddkins is a bit different from most of the books I've read by Dean Koontz - it is indeed a modern fable with, what I feel, are delightful Koontz twists. A nice story. Will be curious to see if there will be other Oddkins books."
5,Great book for all ages!,"I first heard this book when I was in fourth grade I think. My teacher read it to us, and ever since then, I've loved it. I'm 15 now, and every time I go to the library, I search for it. Unfortunately, they have only 2 copies, and it's never in."
3,Interesting way to deal with make-believe on a truly evil level.,"The part I loved best was the ending, as the lady toymaker completed her repairs. Also enjoyed the over the top evil toys in a way. It's like looking evil in the face and identifying its purely bad intentions, recognizing evil that is beyond being reformed and must be completely conquered and destroyed."
5,Amazing Childrens Book,This book lives up to all exspectatins of any Dean Koontz fan. It is cute for the kids but good enough for an adult to enjoy. If you are a fan and want your child to get a head start on being a fan this is a must. The characters are very well developed and fun and of the childrens books that he has written this is my favorite.
5,This story imprinted on my son greatly,"I had forgotten all about this book until today. My 27 year old son just called & he had his 3 children in a bookstore & he couldn't remember the name, but he knew the full story...as I had read it to him when he was a child. He was looking for the book to read to his own kids now. He recited the entire book with all the characters as colorfully as Dean had written them...it makes me feel great to know that a book had such a strong impact on a modern day young person!"
5,Childhood Favorite,"I remember reading this book when I was 10, it's stuck with me ever since. Now with kids of my own I can only appricate the story's plot more. I love this story and am only sadden to know that it is no longer in print for other adults and children to enjoy cheaply."
5,A wonderful tale for kids of all ages,"This is a wonderful story. This could be read to your children, but not right before bedtime. Another fabulous writing from Dean Koontz, thank you."
3,"Great text, frustrating format.","The text is fabulous. Providing access to an underappreciated female writer is desperately needed. The modernized spelling is wonderfully accessible. But using endnotes rather than footnotes to explain all unusual words, references, etc. is unbelievably frustrating. And not even endnotes after each play - endnotes at the end of the book! I am dizzy from flipping back and forth several times each page to the end of the book."
4,LCD display (Samsung SyncMaster),"Bought this for my in-laws to provide a larger screen replacing the laptop they had as the screen was too small. They LOVED this monitor. Looks great, well priced and definitely recommended. Note: be sure to check out multiple sites for price variance before purchasing."
2,Samsung 920NW,"Colors are very good but has slight ghost images/blurry letters. May be my older Dell8100 video card but sounds like other buyers have had same problem. If knew then what I know now, would not have bought it."
2,"Good Color, Works Out of the Box, Poor Clarity","I purchased a Samsung SyncMaster 920NW 19 monitor two weeks ago, and have been disappointed in the quality of the image. Color vibrancy on the unit is good, and like others have noted here, it worked first time out of the box with no fiddling, drivers, etc.However, I was very disappointed in the fuzzy text on the unit. It looks like the whole screen is slightly out of focus. After trying to adjust all of the built-in on-screen controls, I installed the drive that came with the monitor, but saw no improvement. And while this monitor supports a variety of resolutions, there are really only two that I have found that work adequately - the remainder of the resolution settings are completely unusable. I have also installed the latest graphics drivers and tried various driver settings - all to no avail.It looks like I'm going to be returning this unit to the retailer and hopefully finding a better solution."
3,"Good monitor, better are available for similar price","I picked this monitor because it seemed decent and I trust Samsung as a brand. However, within the weeks that followed I've noticed several stores selling LG monitors with much better response times (2ms) and better contrast resolutions (2000:1) for about the same price. Had I known, I would've waited and gotten one of those. I've never had a problem with an LG product either."
4,Sansung 19,"Monitor performs as advertised. $[...].mail in rebate is a pain in the rear, and though not an Amazon refund, it does reflect on Amazon."
3,A great read for all Forestry students,"John Berger is confused. He speaks of evolution and then uses Biblical quotes to support his theories. It can't be both ways!Berger 'personifies' trees and forests often throughout his book and he says they have a 'right to exist' in the preface.Berger's knowledge and understanding of eastern hardwood forests and harvesting techniques is obviously lacking.That being said, Understanding Forests would be a great read for all first-year forestry students in North American colleges and universities. It would point out many of the challenging questions and issues that forestry professionals will be faced with. The book should be re-read in the final semester of the degree program by these same students so that the students can evaluate the theories and ramifications of Berger's philosophies."
1,"book should be called ""Destroying Forests""","I like this book even less than the other reviewer, but for the opposite reason. It would better be called ""Destroying Forests,"" or ""Understanding Forestry."" The book purports to be enviromental in its orientation, and was put out by Sierra Club, but anybody who has been a forest activist at all (and I'm a longtime frontline environmental activist) would recognize that many places in this book--e.g., his treatment of so-called salvage logging--he has bought into the industry lies hook line and sinker. A very bad book on a very important topic."
5,Beautiful Bracelet,"This bracelet is so elegant and classy. It looks like real diamonds and the setting and size makes it absolutely believable. This would make a wonderful gift for someone you love or a nice treat for yourself. It is very well made, with a nice substantial weight (not too heavy for comfort) and it has a very secure clasp. It's just prefect and absolutely gorgeous!"
4,An Encyclopedia of Archetypal Symbolism (Vol 1),"One doesn't need to be a Jungian analyst to benefit from this extensive collection of images. Mythographers, art historians, students of literature - indeed, everyone who cares about meaning in human life - will find something of interest in these dense and haunting pages."
5,Michael Doll,"My grandson loves his little Michael doll. It is perfect for a 6 month old--very soft and cuddly with a sweet expression on his face. Michael's color is just what I wanted for my bi-racial grandson. His grandfather and father weren't keen on a doll for a boy, but baby thinks Michael is his best pal."
5,Cute and Cuddly Boy Doll,"My 6 month old son really loves ""Baby Michael"". The doll is very soft but still wipes off easily. He is well stitched. I really appreciate the doll's color. He is a warm brown and is a good match for my biracial son. This is a great soft brown boy doll - he is really cuddly!"
3,Garland at her best!,"I bought this c.d. for just two tracks to play on my KWXY Radio show. The first is the Oscar nominated ""Far away part of Town"" by Garland. Ms. Garland did not appear in the movie ""Pepe"" however, the poster procalimed ""and featuring the voice of Judy Garland"". It's a wonderful ballad of loneliness and longing. The second track I wanted was ""Suzy's Theme"". Bing Crosby and Maurice Chevalier are also featured on this c.d., you have to be a true movie buff to want this offering but there are enough of us out there. Thanks to Collector's Choice for this re-issue. Don Wardell. Palm Springs."
5,Classic W.A.S.P. !,"At the time...this was the only way to get a copy of this song (Animal). So my rating is totally dependant on that.Now W.A.S.P. apparently has re-released their whole library and tons of extra tracks are on different CD's including this one, leaving this CD a bit redundant.Still, this is classic W.A.S.P., hard, raunchy, mean, and of course controversial. So controversial that their regular record company wouldn't put this song on their CD (hence..this release by a different one).Animal is a great tune, one that brings back fond memories of the battle between Rock and the PMRC.Hellion is my next favorite and while the recording isn't the best, it still rocks. Mountain's Mississippi Queen is covered on this and Blackie does it great justice!"
3,mp3 file problems,"This performance is exemplary. I imagine the original recording is, too. Unfortunately, the Amazon mp3 download version is not. The loudest passages are clipped resulting in a small amount of distortion in the form of splattering. You would have to be a very picky listener to notice, however."
4,Irish Oi!,"I didn't know what to expect with this album. A friend just lent it to me and I think its great. Not sure much about the band....when they came out, how old this album is, etc. It's a classic Oi! style, as far as content, the sound of the songs, and the general attitude of the band. I know its the most popular thing in the world to compare every Irish sounding band to Dropkick Murphys, but these guys are alot different from them. DKM has more of a punk rock feel to them, these guys are definately Oi! I'd say they're closer to the 4-Skins or The Business more than anything else."
4,Good as expected,"As the title of Pearls of Wisdom, it is fine book of review for the board exam of anesthesiology. Good structural sections for the organized each subjects made the one who could like to have bones to study. Will be looking for the new editoin."
3,It's a turkey,"I'm a great fan of Michelin guide books and of Turkey. So I bought this one anticipating the usual thorough coverage of sites, restaurants, & hotels. I generally agree with their ratings of the sites they include, & like their descriptions. But whatever happened to eastern & southeastern Turkey? Yes, the Kurds have made some of these areas inhospitable, but Urfa, Gaziantep, Diyarbakir, Lake Van, among others, aren't even mentioned!Then there's the coverage of hotels & restaurants. This is a fine book for backpackers, but what about the fine hotels & cuisine in Turkey? Not a mention of the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul, the Kismet in Kusadasi, the Dedeman in Nevsehir and Antalya, etc. If you want to travel upscale, try Frommers or the Blue Guide."
3,Not so great,"The lights when placed on shrubbery look very boring; made a mistake in purchasing. I like the random look of lights on bushes outside. They work fine but are just "" too perfect."""
4,Heigh-Ho Mozart,"I enjoy all things Disney and love instrumental music so when I heard this CD playing in my daughter's 5th grade classroom, I asked the teacher where I could purchase a copy. He suggested Amazon.com, which is where I also discovered the companion CD: Bippity Boppity Bach. Beautiful classical style, with familiar Disney tunes ... how can it not be good? ;o)"
3,Heigh-Ho is only So-So,"The 1st half of the CD is quite pleasant and interesting, but I found the 2nd half somewhat tedious and the selections rather remote. I couldn't identify the tunes at all. Overall, it's an nice enough to play on a long drive."
5,This recording Sparkles,"I am very critical of attempts to imitate the sound of particular classical composers, they usually fall short of the mark. This recording is a wonderful exception. I heard one of the selections on a classical radio station and had to have it. Several years later it remains one of my favorite recordings. I usually have music playing when I have guest to the house, but they always seemed a bit overwhelmed by classical selections. This recording pleases everyone. In fact several friends who are not fans of clasical music have added it to their collections. When I'm stuck in rush-hour trafic I pop in this CD and I'm soaring out and over everything, and when I DO get home, I'm nearly disappointed because I want to go on listening. I've been known to take an extra turn around the block just to finish out a song. Please do not think of this as a recording for children, it is a recording for everyone to enjoy."
5,Heigh Ho Mozart,"A whimsical, delightful recording. Well done arrangements of Disney's greatest hits in the styles of great composers."
5,Songs of Inspirationo,"Not only this disc, but all of his discs are SUPER. I now have 7 discs and plan to order more as they become available and I also have 2 DVDs, 7 VHS and listen to some every day. His music makes me feel at peace world and I highly recommend any of his recordings."
5,This the best!,This CD is one of the greatest ever it is easy listening.Daniel O'Donnell is one of the greatest singer of our time.
1,Don't Bother,"These injectors did not work at all. The engine would barely start and ran rough when it bothered to run at all. Could not accellerate as one injector would hiccup and activate late causing severe miss in the firing sequence. I reinstalled three times to make certain it wasn't me causing the problem. Thankfully, Amazon has an incredible return policy and reimbursed me in full. They even paid for return shipping."
3,Good Material - Poor Performance,All of the songs were familiar and peasant to hear again but I am accustomed to orchestral accompaniment and found the solo piano rather dull.
5,love this WOMAN's watch!,"Classy, practical and large enough for aging eyes without being ridiculously oversized like so many watches today. The dots and concentric circles engraved on the dial add an elegance and depth that you can't see in the photo, and the combination of satin and polished links on the band is attractive. I've worn this for about a month now and, so far, it keeps accurate time. I love that it never needs a battery. Note: although it's advertised as the men's watch, the #241075 is the 32mm ladies version, NOT the 41mm men's Ambassador and would probably look too small on most men."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS WATCH!!!!","I purchased this watch about a year ago and have been disappointed with it since day 1. When you are purchasing a watch worth over $600 you might expect that it is able to keep time accurately. Not so. Every morning when I put the watch on, it seemed to have gained a couple of minutes. I contacted Victorinox and they told me that they could recalibrate the watch for me. I sent the watch in for recalibration under warranty, eight weeks later I got the watch back. Now my watch runs SLOW about 2 min/day, so every morning I have to readjust my watch or I end up being late to work/meetings.I will never buy a Swiss Army/Victorinox or an automatic watch ever again.If you do buy the watch, buy it for looks not as a timepiece..."
2,Not all that it's cracked up to be,"I was very excited to read this book because of all the good reviews, but I felt like it was hollow and stilted. I could not make myself feel for the characters and I felt that they were completely unbelievable. It was an interesting plot and could have been developed more by a better author, one who can write more than just some corny poems. I read it till the end, because it was a simple and fast read, and was sorely disapointed. I can't believe this book is so highly reccommended, I think I'll reread The Notebook by Nicolas Sparks, at least he is an author!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Too descriptive, overly romanticized, and a disappointing story. Only finished it because it was part of a book club. This is the first book I have ever read that I didn't care for at all. Don't waste your time."
5,An Amazing Connection!,"I received Shade of the Maple Friday and read the Prologue...I was hooked and unable to put it down. WOW!! It is a beautiful and captivating true love story!! I felt like I was part of their world. Kirk Martin has a real gift for creating a connection between the characters and his readers. I was anxious to finish but at the same time never wanted it to end. I miss Evan and Anna already! I cried a mix of happy and sad tears.Saturday, I told all my friends to read it...and I ordered a copy of The Gravel Drive. I can't wait for my signed copy to appear in my mailbox!"
2,What is all the hype about?,"I bought this due to the ratings of other Amazon[.com] readers. After reading it, I am very unclear about what most readers love about this book. I like all types of books (aside from trashy romance novels) which may be why I found the story line to be predictable, flat and unfulfilling. The Author takes great time to paint pictures, but there is very little depth. If you like romance novels, perhaps you may enjoy this one because it has plenty of romance and charm, but very little substance. I'd say spend your time diving deeper into a book that has more layers of significance and meaning."
2,Good Cause...Boring Romance...Sorry!,"I saw this book title memtioned on a few book club message boards a while back so I thought I'd try it, I'm sorry I did. The story is just plain boring. I didn't even finish it, it was that dull. Why all the hipe of this book I have no idea. Don't say you haven't been warned!"
4,NEED MORE OF THIS!,"Since Sparks recently flopped with his latest formula plot, I went on a search for that rare incident that I would find an author who spoke from the heart. Interestingly enough he's another North Carolina writer. What exactly do they put in the water down there? As a debut book, I was very impressed with the storyline and how Kirk Martin creates this zone of passionate comfort as you read. It's quite nice, especially if you are into stories that grab your heart because you can identify with what the characters are feeling. I look forward to reading more of Martin's work because, I, like many others, are looking for alternative contemporary fiction love stories written by men with passion that I feel is lacking from our society. Rare as they are, when they are found, they are treasured. I can never give a book 5 stars, but Kirk Martin, if you keep it up, I might have to let down my guard. Thank you."
5,The New Nicholas Sparks (Only Better)!,"As someone who thoroughly enjoyed The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, I am so glad that we have another author who knows how to dig deep into our souls and find what is beautiful and good. Kirk Martin's writing is powerful, poetic and inspiring. And he goes even a step or two beyond Sparks- his story is not predictable and he captures a depth of connection that is rare. There's something about the way he writes that makes you feel absorbed into the landscape, and a part of the characters. You feel and experience Shade of the Maple deep inside. Very powerful and moving and uplifting."
5,Refreshing!,"A beautiful, idealistic love story in every way. I genuinely enjoyed sinking into each word. It is refreshing to find a novel that is not heavy and dark and filled with every dysfunction imaginable. I didn't have to struggle just to get through each paragraph, and it took me back to more innocent times. On the surface a very light read, but with important messages that linger subtly."
4,Fast Reads,"I couldn't put either of this author's books down. He writes fast-moving stories that you can feel deep inside. I began corresponding with him through kirkmartinbooks.com and before you know it, was offered an advance copy of GIFTED to read. It is amazing, simply amazing!"
2,I really WANTED to like this book .....,"I really wanted to like this book but just couldn't. All the incredients were there for a wonderful story, but it fell far short of the mark. I hung in there and read the entire thing (thinking it had to get better) but I was overly optimistic.I LOVE Vermont and have spent time in the geographic locations described. The descriptions of the area were the one redeeming feature. Having been there, it was easy to picture the locale and was fairly well described. My main complaint was the stilted language used in the book when describing how the characters interact. Conversations between them were stiff or overly sugary and painful to read. I think had this been turned into a college comp class the best grade it would have received would have been a ""C"".Any comparisons to Nicholas Sparks's work does Mr. Sparks a great disservice. While Mr. Sparks doesn't write great literature that will last through the ages, his books are enjoyable. This one was not."
5,Terrific author and person!,"Having read all of Kirk Martin's books (now numbering 3), I can tell you that each of Kirk Martin's books offers a different view into the human soul. I recently hosted a book-signing party for Kirk Martin and I can tell you from personal experience that he is as interesting a person as his books are to read. Shade of the Maple is a fresh look at an old subject...romance. The Gravel Drive is a look into a father's soul and Gifted is a look at how people who are ""different"" are not always bad. Gifted, his newest offering (available only on his website in limited edition) is just another example of his multi-faceted talent.I hope you will take the time to read some or all of Kirk Martin's literary offerings. I am a devoted fan and I hope you will be too!"
1,I thought I was the only one!,"Thanks to the reader from Berlin, PA. I was beginning to think I must be one of the only people in the world who find books like Shade of the Maple, Bridges of Madison County and Erich Segal's Love Story to be mauldin tripe that would only appeal to preteen girls, IMHO (emphasis on IN MY HUMBLE OPINION - don't want to be pelted with responses from all of you who love one or all of these books!) But, I also loathe Friends and Alley McSqueel on TV as well! :-D Bleech!I could NOT feel any connection with either of the main charactors,booorrriiinnngg!!"
1,Only for the really simple-minded,"I suggest that if you are buying this book based on these reviews, you take the time to actually read all of them (including the one star reviews). There is a consistent theme here of either ""I LOVED it"" or ""this is simplistic nonsense.""I am fully in the simplistic nonsense camp. Maybe you should decide what type of reviewers you are more likely to agree with - romance novel readers or, shall we say, higher-level, quality fiction readers. This book will only satisfy the most immature reader out there. I hate to be mean about it, but it really reads like something an overly starry eyed and ambitious high school freshman girl would write. It's very, very whimpy, and worse than that, very amateurish."
1,"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT//DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",Take all of the good reviews and throw them out the window!!!!!!! READ carefully all of the bad reviews and sticky tape them to your computer so you are not tempted to buy this book!!! This man cannot write!!! If you are looking for a good romance read Flowers from the Storm by Kinsale. I am convinced that all of the good reviews on this book are from FOA (friends of author) and I wonder about the editorial reviews (they must be neighborhood book clubs with members who are FOA)!!!!!
1,"I've never been moved by enough to write a review, but.....","this book was so bad I had to. Amazon.com rating stars have provided me with many great recommendations over the years but this one was way off. This book was one step above (below, maybe some would say, because there is not even a smidgen of sex) a paperback romance. You just wanted to slap all the characters on the sides of their heads and tell them to ""get over themselves"", they were so unrealistic. The story goes nowhere, the characters lives and their goals are so unrealistic, and the decades of years gaps in the the story make you go ""what the?"" Skip it...earlier 5 stars must have been submitted by F.O.A. (friends of author :)"
5,Passionate and Tender,Passionately and tenderly written. One senses this must be a very personal story for the author because you feel it so deeply. How rare and wonderful that a man is able to express his emotions with such depth and clarity as he has done in this book and THE GRAVEL DRIVE. Highly recommend both books from Kirk Martin - you won't be disappointed. And proceeds benefit breast cancer research and Make-A-Wish.
5,A Great Love Story!,"Simply wonderful, one of the best love stories I've ever read, up there with The Notebook.Thanks to Amazon friends, was able to get signed copies as gifts for birthdays and anniversaries from the authors site. What a nice keepsake for books destined to be read again and again. Plus I signed up for a free newsletter at kirkmartinbooks.com. Can't wait for the next one."
2,I don't get it.,Unbelievable. Come on... a love story? Hooey! I bought this book because of the great reviews here. What a disappointment. The characters are not believable and neither are the choices they made. The best part is the descriptive writing about the countryside and the seasons. It's nice that the author donates some proceedes to breast cancer.
2,Major Disappointment!,"Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin was a major let down to say the least. Sappy at best. I did so want to like this book, I have seen the title self-connected to every bestseller on the market today. What a major disappointment for me after all the glowing reviews of this book!I suppose the story has a few doable qualities in all fairness. The characters were believable but sadly (dull). The plot a bit too sappy but doable. I think this writer does have a little talent, but that talent needs time to develop before he can compete with the BIG GUNS in the business. Maybe his next book will work for me. (I gave this two stars instead of one because of the effort it must have taken to write it)"
5,Can't Wait for The Gravel Drive!,Shade of the Maple changed my heart. I have read it three times now and continue to find new meaning and depth each time. I can't wait to read The Gravel Drive. I read the excerpt and was already in tears so I'll have the kleenex ready. It is supposedly a very personal story about the author and his son.
2,sentimental mush,I was so disappointed in this book. If you are into mindless sentiment it might satisfy.
4,UPF 50+ shirt,"good sun protection, size runs a tad small. Wears fairly well for a pool/water product"
3,Still more mediocre re-releases,"This is the fourth, and apparently final, volume in the Polka Dance Party series. All four consist simply of old recordings by various artists, and all four fall short of top-notch recording quality. The overall level (and bass) is lacking, requiring extra volume on playback. Volumes 3 and 4 are a cut above Volume 2, but some problems remain. At least one number, ""Laendler"" (actually a polka) by the Six Fat Dutchmen, is cut off at the beginning. Another, ""Happy Wanderer"" by Frankie Yankovic, starts off with some wow and flutter, as though the turntable had not reached full playing speed when the recording began. You'd be better off with single-artist CDs from Frankie Yankovic, Joey Miskulin, Walter Ostanek, and a number of others."
1,Ignore this release!,"First off, I love this show. I really love it and I was happy to hear it was coming to DVD via CreateSpace! But buyer beware, these episodes on this set are not how they were aired or seen. These episodes are the same ones found on Amazon Instant Video. As another Amazon reviewer Uncle Biff pointed out and I quote ""The episodes have been cut up and rearranged from their original order into new ""theme"" episodes, taking matches from different episodes (and seasons) which meet the theme criteria (ex ""Divas Of Destruction) and joining them together to make new episodes."" Unquote. As soon as I found out the episodes on Amazon Instant Video and DVD were one and the same, I canceled my order. So if you really want Celebrity Deathmatch on DVD, keep waiting and hope Paramount, MTV, or Shout! Factory will release the series as how it was aired and seen."
5,Very good product,These cartridges work very well. They last a long time and provide a very high quality image. I am very pleased with the performance of this product.
1,Mo' Better Blues Wannabe!!!!!!!,"The movie is extremely boring and the blind guy is just plain annoying, Antonio Fargas (Shoop) doesn't make the movie any better. I recomend that you see the movie only to lagh at how poorly it was displayed."
4,Interesting and Very Cool,"It's odd that a new soundtrack would feature so many ""old"" songs. Rob Zombie and Filter offer new remixes of their popular songs, and Hole offers a remix of ""It's All Over Now Baby Blue"" which was available as a B-side on the ""Malibu"" single. The Tricky Track is a barely remixed version of antihistimine, and Kid Rock's contribution ""Warm Winter"" dates from 1995. So if you are a fan of these bands looking for new material be forewarned! However, the soundtrack is a great compilation of some of the best artists in the alternative rock scene. THE CROW has always featured great soundtracks, and this is no exception! I enjoy the music better than the films in most cases, and I was not disappointed this time around. Definitely a must-have CD for all you alt-rock fans because it gives you a good mix of great bands. The perfect solution for ""what do I play"" while cruising around this Summer."
2,The Time Has Passed,"With remixes aplenty in the 16 tracks, the soundtrack series has the feel of the movie trilogy; the franchise has run its course. The film was released straight to DVD and there is a staleness with the music due the majority of the cuts being found in other accessible venues.The most creative is Danzig's reworking of Belly of the Beast, which is entitled, Underbelly of the Beast. Hole's cover of Bob Dylan's It's All Over Now, Baby Blue was previously issued as a B-side, hence the original could be considered the most tough to find.The previous pair of soundtracks fit perfectly with the mood of the films and were outstanding stand-alone releases that solidly showcased the sounds from the alternative scene, albeit from artists who mostly led the playlists on commercial FM radio outlets that featured that music. But that time had passed by the time this project got (re)mixed."
4,good.,A great line up. Check out the Stabbing westward song. The crow movie's are amazing and the sound tracks are never a let down. Very nice mixes. ......yes.
2,Overrated!,Played this non-stop at work and I still can't find much here. Maybe I'm missing something but an album of remakes and lame tunes does not knock my socks off.
1,Salvation: Save me from this CD!!!,"Without ever seeing the movie, I can still tell you that this CD is horrible, especially when comparing it to the first Crow CD. The only good song on it was Static X's cover of Ministry's ""Burning Inside."" It's an incredible cover with lots of intensity, distortion, and the lead singer of Fear Factory as a guest star! However, I never thought I would see bands like Kid Rock or Filter on a Crow CD. I've never seen the movie, but don't buy the CD."
4,Close runner up to YOU AXED FOR ME,"All in all a good album.Does not have the same quality as YOU AXED FOR ME,still a good album by the MENTORS.The explicit lyrics are still there,but if that does'nt bother you then pick up a copy and judge for yourself."
3,Fun Item,"This is lovely and colorful and my husband loves it! It does have wall mountings built into the back but, it didn't come with an external mounting bracket so it's still sitting in it's box on the window sill until we can figure out a way to mount it so it can be seen from the window."
3,Stop the whining,"Though this book contains insights into the nature of life in the country, it still strikes me as primarily a book of whining. Outlining in detail the supposed hardships of lighting a fire or planting a garden or canning tomatoes demonstrates the shallow nature of this woman. I guess this is what America has become - a bunch of soft city slickers who can't be depended upon to bear even the slightest inconvenience. I am suprised that she did not develop any ""predator rage"" at the mink killing the rabbits or ""weather rage"" when it would snow(!) in the winter. I sure am glad that we do not have to depend on this woman to found Plymouth Colony or settle the West."
1,Condescending,"I have read a number of books about rural living and/or moving to the country, but this book is one I would not recommend to anyone. There is one word for this author and it is ""condescending"". She makes fun of the ""locals"" while pretending NOT to...I was not fooled. In addition, the constant ridicule of the former homeowners' decorative taste was something I could have done without. Apparently Ms. Miller is a nature lover and a bird watcher (both GOOD things), so WHY did she refer to Canada Geese as ""Canadian"" Geese...where was her editor? I finished the book, but did a lot of skipping as some parts were way too long winded and uninteresting. I agree with another reviewer that the ending was quite abrupt and gave no clue as to whether this woman found happiness anywhere. All I know is that I wouldn't want her for a neighbor."
1,Self-centered drivel,"As a native of Centre County I looked forward to hearing someones view of an area of the country that I have left and returned to for its quirky charm and customs. But instead what I found was a smug, self-indulgent story that rambles on never to make a profound or astute observation. The author portrays herself and her husband as superiors to their earnest, hardworking neighbors --she laughs at, not with them. She mocks their holiday customs, their offers of help, and assistance, their entertainment,their towns, every element of their lives. If I could give this book negative stars, I would, but the form wont let me. I can't believe any publisher thought this book she be printed."
1,Humorless self-indulgence,"As someone who grew-up in Central Pennsylvania, I looked forward to reading about someone else's experiences in an area of the country that I love. Instead, I found a smug, self-indulgent story that twitters on with a superior air and provides as much depth and insight into what Pennsylvania country life is really like as a piece of used plastic wrap.I loved the self-deprecating humor of books like Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence,"" in which the author provides a rich tapestry of what it is like to adapt to a different culture, and was suckered into reading this book on the promise that it was of the same caliber. IT IS NOT!! At all times, the author portrays herself and her husband as superior beings to their earnest, hardworking neighbors --she laughs at, not with them. If I could give this book negative stars, I would, but the form won't let me."
4,E-mini Index Futures,"OTA (Online Trading Academy) make some really good educational CD's and DVD's and I would say this one falls into that statement as well. It does offer only very basic information. In fairness to the CD, it is #1 in a two part set with the second CD being advanced strategies. This does not make the CD bad, however, the cost of the CD (even used) might be better spent on a book where one would get much more info or for free on the internet. I would have preferred only one CD with a little more advanced info on it along with some basic info, yet, that is not the fault of this basic part 1 CD. If someone wants a basic overview of the E-mini index futures market and prefers the information presented to them on a CD, this might be applicable - just know you will be getting basic information that you might be able to find online if you were willing to invest a little time."
4,World Anthems NOT World National Anthems,"- in response to those reviews written before mine - The title of the CD is World Anthems. An Anthem is an Anthem, not a politically endorsed song. A nation may have many Anthems. This is a Music CD not an index of National Anthems, and the pieces/arrangements were chosen because they play well in a Brass Ensemble. There are qualities to the ""stagnant"" and ""boring"" pieces which are breathtaking to the ear of a brass connoisseur. I'm quite sure that the producers/editors are capable of knowing each countries National Anthem. The emphasis is on the Music (as it should be) and what a Brass Ensemble can do. Excellent CD."
1,These people cannot read music score!,"I have listened some world anthem CDs, but this is by far the worst CDs of this theme. I am Japanese. When we listen to Japanese anthem which is played by foreign performers, we usually laugh at these performance. They just do not understand our culture. Our national anthem is so often arranged to different way than we Japanese do. When we heard Japanese anthem in this CD, I and my wife were so uncomfortable, or upset. We even thought we were insulted. They did not only arrange the tune, they also change the pitch of the anthem. They just changed the anthem to totally different tune. IF THEY CANNOT READ THE MUSIC SCORE, THEN DO NOT PLAY! I am hoping, this CD will be discontinued, thus not many people remember this strange tune as the Japanese anthem! I beg Amazon buyers not to buy this sort of CDs. I prefer not making any comments for other anthems because of the reason above."
2,Harlequin Meets Harlot,"This is a slightly amusing and trashy book if you have an hour or two to spare. Don't gear up for any major intellectual challenges, this is the standard bodice-ripper Harlequin-type romance combined with adult bawdy themes. It consists of two stories which might make the more prudish of us blush, but excite the more mildly prurient reader. The stories take place in the Victorian era, and our lovely ladies have a heck of a more lively sex life than we were ever led to believe took place during those times."
5,The Happiest Moments of My Childhood,"Watching my father lipsync to Mickey Katz was one of the greatest pleasures of my childhood. Tom Lehrer, Mickey Katz, my father a meshugana and wacky children joining in---some of the nicest people I've ever met were the ones who would hear me babbling the words to ""Where is my pants?"" and who didn't shake their heads but joined in.I can still remember the cover of the album ""the Meshugana Mickey Katz"" as it lay on the top of the pile of LPs...we always thought of Joel Grey as ""you know, Mickey Katz's son...""To whoever finally put some of these recordings on CD...Thanks...and how about some more?????"
4,Nothing very new - but she is knowledgable and motivating :-),"Chris Freytag knows her stuff. I have many of her workouts on dvd and so knowing how good of an instructor she is, I knew she'd have good stuff to say in her book. She does. She is well educated in health and she is certified by the American Council on Exercise. While she doesn't really add anything new to what we all already know, she does add insight to what she sees with her clients. She talks about their motivation or lack thereof and how to deal with all of that. Then she goes on to talk about ditching myths, excuses, building better body images, and then goes into the nitty gritty about diet and exercise.It is a good read. It's choc full of information and hopefully enough motivation for people as they struggle with doing workouts and eating right."
4,A look inside the author's WWII experience,"As a general rule I don't particularly like biographical books unless they are about a historically significant person or do an exceptional job of bringing the reader into a historical period. This book falls under that second criteria. The book draws the reader into the social, military, and personal life of the author during World War II. Delta, My Beloved is a finely crafted autobiographical story that reads like a well-written fiction novel and is a recommended read."
2,"Disappointed, I really wanted (and needed) these to work","I bought these to put in my diaper bag for my two year old. He made a huge mess in his car seat by squeezing. Great for older kids who won't squeeze the bottles, but not for the younger set who like to still make a mess. I think that by the time a child is that age, you can purchase the bottles of water with the pull top that they can shut."

4,bittersweet nostalgia,"If you have never been to Perth, Australia, then try watching this offering. It gives an accurate tour of the city. Highlighting the nice places. Where ""Perth"" also includes the port of Fremantle.Yes, the city overall is indeed as clean and city as the shots of the CBD show. Unlike some cities in other countries, there is little of a skid row. Few homeless. So it is not like Jacobe sanitised this presentation.While for anyone who hailed from Perth, it can be a bittersweet tang of nostalgia. Seeing Kings Park [note no apostrophe; that got elided decades ago] and the sweeping view of the Swan River and the city centre from the cenotaph in the Park. While Freo has gotten quite yuppified, with all the new fancy boutiques and coffeshops."
3,Chemise nightgown,"It was very nice, all in all, but the M-L size description was more on the smaller end of that and the material was a little scratchy. It will get some good use though."
3,Cirith Ungol - 'One Foot In Hell' (Metal Blade),"Band's so-so third record - first scaring customers out of music stores in 1986. Unfortunately, this CD isn't as good as the Los Angeles metal band's first two - 'Frost And Fire' or 'King Of The Dead'. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad, just nothing out-standing. Tunes I thought sort of stood out were the in-your-face ""Chaos Descends"", the somewhat inspiring ""100 MPH"", ""Doom Planet"" and maybe the title cut ""One Foot In Hell"". Even though their guitarist has passed on awhile back, I would still like to possibly see the three living members reunite. Saw a live video of theirs on You Tube and their live performance appeared to have been pretty raw and intense."
5,Chaos descends....,"Hard, heavy, fast and raw is the best way to describe 'old' Cirith Ungol. Full of wicked lyrics and driving guitar hits, these songs are definitely for the Chaos-oriented. From Blood & Iron, to Chaos Descends, to Nadsokor (The City of Thieves from Moorcock's Elric Saga?), to 100MPH, and One Foot In Hell this album hits hard, fast and relentlessly with the deep throaty growl of Tim Baker at the lead. IF you can still find it, their follow-up album King of the Dead, with Toccata in dminor, Finger of Scorn, King of the Dead, Atom Smasher, Black Machine, Cirith Ungol, and Master of the Pit is a great compliment to the other CD and the two will make quite a compilation of all their early great stuff."
3,this is a good kite to get into flying,"The kite itself is good to get started into kiting but the construction itself is, you get what you pay for...the tubing on the frame is the cheapest way to put a kite together..when you buy a more expensive kite the construction gets more advanced...but this is a good kite to learn on and since it's not that expensive you won't worry about crashing it as much"
4,"Very functional, fabric pattern not as seen online","I received this pack n' play as a registry gift from Target. My husband and I chose this Graco model because of the ease of use and features on it. We had tried out a Chicco model at BRU and it took 4 people to get it folded and put back up!Anyway, when we got it and opened it, it was just as we had tried in the store and we had it assembled in about 20 minutes. It was very easy to fold and put into the bag.The bad part. The photos online show the pattern to be somewhat subdued and ""chic"". When we opened it the pattern was very bold and the blue stripes in the plaid was like bright turquoise blue, not a baby or smokey blue like I had thought. I laughed because it looked so crazy with the brown and cream.We are keeping it. The functionality is what is most important and it's not as bad as some of the other models we have seen and we wanted something gender-neutral. Just be forewarned of the brightness in the pattern."
4,Nice and affordable,"We received our Graco Pack 'n Play Yard and got it all set up in just an hour or so. The parts seem to be very sturdy and well constructed. The instructions were a bit difficult to follow, but they helped us get the job done. We are still waiting for our baby to arrive so I can't provide feedback on how well the actual use of the product is, but there are so many features that I imagine will come in handy. Great price for all that you get and the fabric/pattern is very nice."
2,Smells Very Plastic-y,This pack n play is huge and not super portable but it is sturdy. But it smelled very strongly of plastic which is a drawback.
3,Convenient.,"We used this bassinet for our daughter's first 1 1/2 months and she slept soundly enough in it.What I don't like about this is that the changing table tilts towards the left and it tilts the baby too when you're changing. It's rather large, and takes up quite a bit of room as well.I don't like how the changing table hangs over the sleeping area, and while a newborn is not big enough to use the whole thing it is still a little disconcerting to have the changing table hanging over your child especially when the risk of SIDS is high and air flow is imperative to reduce the risk.I haven't used it as a playard quite yet, but I think that's when this will prove it's worth. I still give it 3 stars for convenience. This would be great for a jet-setting baby."
2,"OK, but matches way too short!!!!","This video isn't awful, but I need to warn everybody who are considering buying it, they don't show close to the full matches. I think there were too many post-match summaries, and not enough actual matches. I wish I hadn't bought this tape, seeing that I wanted to get classic Wrestlemania matches, in their entirety."
3,"The video is good, but not great.",This video could have been better. It was entertaining and its worth buying considering its pretty cheap here at Wrestlezone. It would have been better if it had some classic matches in their entirety like the Undertaker vs Diesel match would have been great to see in more than 2 minutes.
4,Pretty Good,This is a pretty good video but it dosent have enough of the WWF world title. They dont have diesel vs HBK at wrestlemania XI. They dont have bret hart vs yokozuna at WM X or WM IX.
1,WWF can't make a damm thing right!,"This tape is one of the worst tapes I have ever seen. Why the WWF abandoned Coliseim Video is beyond me. The tape was fully biased towards the WCW and they skipped a gaggle of great Wrestlemania matches. I could make a better tape than that, I know I could!"
2,Could be better,"This video is alright, i was quite dissapointed when they left out most of the best matches, There are some good matches like Hogan V Andre,Shawn V Razor.If the video was on for longer it may make it a bit better.I was quite dissapointed."
2,THE BEST OF WRESTLEMANIA I-XIV-A POOR VIDEO,"Despite the fact that it says the best, this video fails to include such matches as Ricky ""the Dragon"" Steamboat against Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage or even Bret Hart against Owen Hart. This video recognizes the Ladder match as well as the Iron Man match but most of this video is tiresome and boring. Not recommendable."
2,this video didnt show enough of the greatest matches .,"this video didnt show enough of what u want to see,it showed some good matches,but mainly the whole thing was talking.if u ask me it isnt worth 10 dollars.so use your money to get something better like a yo-yo or something.IF u smell what thew ROOOOOOCCCCCKKKKK is cooking!!!"
4,"good, could have been better","The WWF did some good things and some bad. Most of the matches were good, except a few were left out. What about Hogan-Slaughter and Warrior-Savage at Wrestlemania VII? I thought these were classic matches. They should have focused less on crappy stuff and showed more of the better matches."
3,coulda been better,"This film was excelently put together, but could have been done much better. They concentrated too much on former main events or past clips of big stars, and none barely on the other matches..there was hardly any or no demoliton, dino bravo, big boss man, regau brothers UNLESS they were in the ring with the harts or hogan....all u got to see was main events, but in a way its a 3 star video...it shoulda been a 2 tape set and had more"
1,this tape had no good matches from the great superstars,"come on. i could have made a better video than this. they showed so many hogan matches. let's be real how many moves does hogan have besides the big boot,leg drop, and a body slam. they barely showed bret hart and shawn michaels which i think are the greatest wrestlers of all time.and what's with this giant gonzalez guy.you the hell likes him. if i had a body suit with hair all over it would you put me in a best of wrestlania tape. and why is there so much crap from the first wrestlemania it was the worst one ever but for some reason they showed so many clips from it. i'm not going to tell you to buy this tape all right cause it is just a waste of money"
4,"Great!, but missing something............","This tape pretty much contains a lot of great Wrestlemania moments. But to my surprise, the tape left out the "" best "" Wrestlemania matches. Some are Savage vs Steamboat ( WM3 )the Warrior vs Savage retirement match and it's aftermath ( WM7 ) the main events for Wrestlemania 9&10 and the classic Bret Hart vs Owen hart at Wrestlemania 10. This tape is still worth the money though! Get it!"
5,Quintessential acid,"A few years after the die-off of the acid house obsession of the late 1980s, Hardfloor decided to ""resuscitate"" the TB-303 bass emulator for the '90s. They gave the sound a mightier thump and many more layers of squelchy, wet, bubbling, screaming acid. This album alone set much of the foundation that made the 303 the lead guitar of dance music for the '90s. For a while after that thousands of artists adopted the acid sound, and you have to admit, even the most avid acid fan got pretty tired of those overused acid basslines. TB Resuscitation is a tribute to the proper (ab)use of the 303."
4,Great basketball documentaries,"I saw these movies at the Heartland Film Festival in Indianapolis in 2004, and I really enjoyed them. Of course, any basketball movies in my home state of Indiana will be a hit, but these two documentaries show a different side of the game that we don't see in Hoosiers. They show us that not all dreams become reality and that sometimes the best and the brightest end up as the biggest disappointments."
2,Buy only if you are aware of basic dog health foods!,"Though likely well intentioned - the recipes for this book are not well researched. The author suggests that onions be used - in many recipes - but, according to my vet, onions can be deadly to dogs!! Other than onions - there are many recipes that suggest loads of cheese... there are great recipes to modify - but, unless you are acutely aware of dog health issues and needs, this book may not be as helpful as you would like."
5,Action-packed historical fiction,"""Indian Drums & Broken Arrows"" is a ""wonderful read"" for boys ages 10 and up. It has a lot of adventure and is historical fiction at its best. It is set during the time of the American Revolution in upstate New York. The book got my two oldest boys interested in historical fiction, which led naturally to the novels by G. A. Henty. Although written in a different style, this book compares favorably to Henty's novels and if you like historical fiction, you'll like this book. This book was written in 1952; unlike some novels written today, there is nothing ""objectionable"" in its content (the author was a Christian pastor). Be aware that, in my humble opinion, this book tells a much more interesting story than its sequel ""Brown Shadow"" which was written many years later; however, ""Brown Shadow"" is adequate for those who simply want further adventures with the lead character. If you have boys, you should track down a copy of this book!"
4,Me love you short time...,"For my money, no jeans brand fits as well as Lee, and these regular-fit jeans look great in ""Thunder"" gray. That said, I don't think I'm going to get a lot of mileage out of this recently-purchased pair. They fit me perfectly out of the bag, but after one washing they're already borderline too short. I washed them in cold water and dried them on the lowest heat setting, but they seem to have shrunk quite a bit nevertheless. And if the shrinkage is residual, as it is with most cotton products, they're only going to keep getting shorter. Bummer. Guess I should have bought a size larger in the inseam..."
4,almost my size,I find it hard to find jeans close to my size. In fact I only found about 25 pair in all on amozon.com that were 36x29. my actual size is not even offered. ie: 36x28 Which would be a great size to start marketing since no one makes that size. HINT... HINT... HINT...
4,Great fit at a great price!,"I've worn Lee jeans for several years now ever since Levi's changed the fit on their jeans. I don't think the Lee jeans last quite as long as the Levis, but the Regular Fit Straight Leg jeans fit a lot better for my body type (6' 2"" 185 lbs). Lee also offers a lot of cool colors, so I can mix things up a bit. The price is right especially if you can find them on sale. I've found that after a few years of regular wear these jeans will begin to develop holes at the top corners of the rear pockets. That's when I toss them and order more."
4,Lee Jeans Fit!,"Good color, good quality and they fit like Lee's jeans always fit...very well. I wear them to school and they take a beating and still look good."
4,"good fit, good price",Definitely worthwhile - much cheaper than the mall and the Lee website. Fits well and the material is soft. Would recommend highly
3,Color discrepency,"Jeans are nice but color depicted online, not true. Beware of color variation when making choice based on ""how it looks"" online.In my case, ""dune"" was not off-white as it appeared, but really kaki."
5,Great Fit,"These jeans fit better than most Levi's. The color is super, and wash very well. I could not have asked for better AND the price was so great. SO PERFECT. Anyone these are a good fit. Ride nice. Don't stretch out much. Just completely happy."
3,Nice...but...,"Color is great...size , not so great.....the rise on the jeans is just a tad to small....I am constantly pulling up the jeans because they feel as if they will fall off"
1,"Horrible fit, good fabric.","Legs aren't straight as seen on photos. Size isn't tight or slim as I read on other reviews, these are very baggy. Maybe I received a wrong item, or they did. Fabric seems to be good. The worst jeans i have ever had..."
4,excellent quality a lil snug,excellent quality a lil snug but feels great and for the price it's a good deal guess just need to shed off few pounds but loving the color and the texture
5,Great casual jeans,"These jeans are prefect for times when blue denim is just a little to casual. Lighter than the blues these jeans work really well in a business causal setting, or with a sport coat. And, they are cut to fit a normal person, not relaxed or baggy."
4,too small,"I like the jeans for all the reasons everyone else states, but the 34 waist felt like at best 33, more like 32.5. At first I thought my old Arizona 34s had just stretched, but a new pair of Wrangler 34s I just bought actually fit like I thought they would, so I tend to think these were a bit smaller than the expected 34."
2,It wasn't as I expected!,"A very dissapointing quality. Since I bought same brand and model last year (March 24, 2012) I expected same finishing details.Even though I bought this year a bigger size (36) it didn't fit me as well as the one I bought before (34). Could anyone explain it to me?"
4,lee jeans,"the jeans fit beautifully, and the color was exactly what we wanted. Only problem was that the legs were a tad too baggy, but we ordered ""regular"" instead of ""slim"" fit, so we are pleased."
5,"Half the price and equal quality of ""501's""",I went to a Kohls to buy some tan colored levis. I thought the guy was kidding when he said they were $64. I decided to try the Lee's jeans in the same color. I could not be more pleased with them.
2,bad fit and odd appearance for new,"I buy pretty much only Lee (hate Levi) and also had just recently bought some Lee jeans this size at Kohl's and they fit great so felt I had a good shot for a fit with these. Bought 2 pair and both turned out to be much too tight at the waist and also while they had all the right tags just didn't seem like 'new', they had a washed kind of rough/bumpy/unoressed look and feel that you don't see with a new pair from the mall."
2,Lee jeans review,This is my second pair of Lee jeans. The first were purchased in a store and these were bought online. The size is listed the same for both jeans and they look identical except for color (I ordered a different color). This pair seems much smaller than the first and I had to check the sizes to see if I had ordered them wrong but they both read the same.I guess I will have to order them in the store in the future to be sure they fit.
5,great product,This is the first time I am ordering jeans through Amazon - I am not a big fan of ordering cloths online without trying it on and I got it just right and will buy more.
5,Lee Jeans,"Lee jeans are always a good buy. Great fit, great quality. My 15 year old son loves them. And they don't hang off his butt!"
2,Cut a bit short,Leg length short compared to same size in Wrangler or Elwood jeans ordered at the same time. Color and waist fine
4,My first pair of bluejeans in 20 years,Fits nicely and work pretty much like I expected.Always had Levi's before but have no trouble adjusting to these
1,Estrechos,Yo siempre uso esta medida de pantalones y estos me quedaron estrechos no los puedo usar perdi la compra. c
2,Not colorfast,"I was disappointed that after wearing these jeans for a day, my white shoes and shoelaces have permanently turned blue where the pants had brushed against them."
2,Sent me two differentsizes,"Really liked my 1st pair of Lee regular fit jeans,but like a lot of things this order seemed rushed.Two different sizes and no packing slip or invoice.So what is my recourse but to go shopping elsewhere.If Jeff Bezos is the Fortune Man of the Year some of us are not getting our vote"
2,Just Feels Wrong,"I bought my last pair of Lee's jeans 43 years ago. After buying them and when they were still new I bent over and they promptly split open right at the butt. I promised myself I'd never buy another pair again. Well, I did. I bought two pair, one in color ""delta"", the other in green. Right out of the package, without washing, the green pair are tight. I washed the ""delta"" color before putting them on, the fit was about right but didn't feel right Just feels wrong. When I sit down the waist slides down, which necessitates a belt. When I stand up I have to pull them up. My attitude toward Lee's Jeans hasn't changed. I'm not going to throw them away but if I have another pair of another brand I'll choose the other."
3,too tight for me.,"I ordered one size bigger in the waist then what I normally wear and they are still on the tight side. They feel somewhat like skinny jeans. I have ones that are a different color, and they fit much better. Not sure why the Dune color was tighter. Otherwise I like the pants, but for me, since I wan't be wearing them much, it was kind of a waste for me.I don't like giving bad reviews, but this is just my honest experience."
3,Not a Bad Jean,"These jeans were true to size for me, and looked good; liked the stitching which matched the jean color. Negatives: the quality of the material/denim is such that it's a little coarser than nice soft denim; this is a bit noticeable, for example, at the back of the knee when material brushes against the skin-it feels very slightly like wool or coarse canvas. The fabric also has very slight 'streaks'-one can see this in the 'Dune' version. It's also on the thinner side."
3,"Baggy, but they fit.","As has been my experience with Lee jeans, they fit and seem like good cheap jeans. I would like a wider range of color choices.Recently bought a second pair and was disappointed to find that they're considerably baggier (wide legs) than the previous pair (same exact size, same ""Regular Fit""). There's at least an inch of extra width in the legs. Looking for consistency and accuracy in labeling!"
5,excellent product,"recomiendo ampliamente comprar, enviaron la talla correcta, el color correcto, y en el tiempo estimado, muy bueno. El color es exacto al de la muestra en la foto."
3,one month wait,"what is so special about grey jeans that it takes one month from purchase to receive. The product itself, no complaints. I order Lee jeans often for my sibling; however, waiting one month for a pair of jeans to ship is ridiculous so this gets three stars instead of four. I wanted to cancel the order but he really wanted a pair of grey jeans."
3,Lee Jeans Colors are Incomprehensible,"Lee jeans colors are incomprehensible. I mean, what color is ""razor""? I'm an old guy. I want indigo denim jeans like always; what color is that?"
1,Cut inconsistently and sized randomly.,"I should have paid more attention to the fact that some reviews of this item call the fit very large and baggy and others call it extremely tight and skimpy. What they agree on is that when you order this item in any particular size, the size of what arrives is a crap shoot. It's the same problem as with Levis. I was hoping Lees were more consistent than Levis. I was wrong."
2,Lee jeans Regular Fit Straight Leg,I the first time ordered Lee jeans. Before always bought Levi's. I was waited by disappointment as jeans appeared less for the size from declared.
4,"Nice variety of colors, great price.","I've always been a Levis 550 kind of guy, but the price keeps going way up. I decided to try these and have just ordered my third pair. I little different fit, but I like the difference. Comes in a variety of colors, too."
4,A Must for Intercultural Trainer,"This very good book covers many fields in intercultural training, communication and psychology. People, who are working in rthis field can argue with empirical case studies, why it is so important for global companies to adapt and implement intercultural training and management programs in their activities. Many prominent researchers and scientists on this field, as Stella Ting-Toomey, Harry C. Triandis, Milton J. Bennett, John W. Berry and many others participated in writing one of the best refernce books in interculturalism."
1,Didn't receive Rise Up when promised - or at all,"Can't review the product as I never received it on the date span I was promised. Asked for a shipping tracking # and got a back order notice. Was billed on my Discover account, questioned and then was promised a refund which I've yet to see."
5,King of Pain is the King of Singles!,"Ok, this is such a nice Cd that it's not funny. The Unplugged version of King of Pain is definetly the winner on the Alanis Unplugged album. It is just so resonant. The B sides are also brilliant. Baba Unplugged aired on the MTV Unplugged Television program but was not included on the Alanis Unplugged CD. It is here now and it is great. Thank U Unplugged was previously available for download to those who purchased Alanis Unplugged online, well, now everyone can have this excellent, excellent recording. Your House Unplugged is very brilliant. This song is relatively rare in the Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie era, and this version is absolutely beautiful. My suggestion, buy this CD and when you get it, never take it out of your CD player!"
3,Decent Cover of a Classic Song,"Everyone seems to think this is an original song by Alanis but in fact it's a famous 80s song written by Sting and the Police, reworked slightly to say Queen instead of King in the chorus. It's a decent enough cover, though."
3,did u know?,william saroyan's human comedy is a simple book to read....it depicts a boy named homer and his family in Ithaca (fresno) it is more like a book of children's books in different chapters with one prevailing moral. william saroyan himself is a dit. he was abusive and did it at prostitution places....
3,"The Human Comedy.... more like ""The Human Drama""!","This book is a story about a California family whose eldest son is sent off to war. The younger brother must provide for the family by getting a job as a telegraph messenger. There is alot of drama within the book and much of it is not needed. There is very little humor in this story. I have now learned the meaning of ""Don't judge a book by its cover"". I would recomend this book to anyone who likes family drama and light reading."
5,"This is a great book, a work of genius by Saroyan","I had to read this for school, and at first I didn't like it. As we examined it closely, however, I began to realize how great the book is. The extensive symbolism was terrific and Saroyan's understanding of human nature was amazing. I loved it."
5,You couldn't GIVE it enough stars!!! Loved this book!!!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a wonderful little snapshot of life in Ithaca, CA, as told through the lives of those who live there. But what I loved most about it were two things. One, other than the dramatic moments when a war dept. telegram was read, this book did not have that sort of overly (and phony) theatrical feel that other authors feel they must provide whenever they deal with similar subjects. Instead, Saroyan gave the majority of attention to the mundane, ordinary routines of life and showed how people truly LIVED in times of great distress. Two, I loved the synchroncity of events in certain parts of the book. In one scene, at the EXACT MOMENT that Homer is taking off on his bicycle to pick up messages, Marcus and his friend Tobey are on a passenger train taking off for their own mission. Pitiful example, I know, but read this book and you'll know what I'm talking about!"
2,Next please. . .,"On those days when you feel like reading a good book, do not pick up the Human Comedy. The protagonist, Homer, does not at all seem human, even though he is made out to be a teenager. The author tries to brink back some of ancient Greece to California, with Homer living in Ithaca. As far as the plot goes, it develops slowly. However, once the plot has been developed, it is a lot easier to read. This novel is a recounting of one boy's family, and how they and their friends are affected by the war."
1,Cliche',I had heard about Saroyan and picked up the book at a thrift store. What a disappointment. I knew from the very beginning how the story was going to end. The characters were pretty unbelievable. Everyone was sooooooooooo good and wholesome! Ultimately i found the book quite boring.
1,A Book for the Ages...,"This book is one that has no real plot. It continues on, with purpose kept well hidden-- from the begging to the end-- from the reader. In fact, if there was a purpose I have yet to find it. It has detail, and thankfully not as much as John Steinbeck, which would make it totally unbearable. Only bother with this book if you have a high tolerance for wandering through the story. You will not have a main character. You will not get anything out of the multiple diversion thrown into the book. I would, in short, recommend you get a book that has a plot, a purpose, ANYTHING but the pure 'fluff' in this one."
5,"Relevant, simple, heartfelt!","Having read the Armenian translation, I was glad to finally sit down with the original. And what a difference! Although the translation was wonderful in its own way and I had enjoyed the book very much, but there is something to be said for the language Saroyan uses: so simple, yet so profound. The story is still relevant today with so many young soldiers going to war and with families left behind to take care of themselves. How do you grow as a family when the war has taken so much from you including your teenager's childhood? Having a teenager myself, I can't even imagine what the main character is exposed to because he has to support his family. It's a perfectly suitable read for almost all ages. Don't postpone enjoying this masterpiece."
4,Movie & Bookboth good,He writes so well - you are there - if you like the early 1900's you will love this - quick read -flows beautiful.
3,Don't pay over $40 for this lamp.,"The lamp is OK. On the plus side, it was only $39.99 at a Target store, and it provides an excellent, well-diffused source of light that's not harsh like most torchiere-style lamps. Now for the drawbacks: it's flimsy, the touch-activated switch is annoying as hell, and up close, it's obvious that the lampshade is plastic. I found a similar lamp with genuine mica for the shade for about $100, which I would have preferred. This lamp is only a bargain if you can resist the urge to replace it after 3 months with something that doesn't look fake."
3,Excellent...but wanted more,"Let me first say that I am a huge fan of FFH. Their worshipful lyrics, and incredible harmonies make them one of my favorite contemporary Christian artists. I guess I just expected more from this album. I really felt it was just more of the same stuff they released on their last album. I like it when an artist ""pushes the envelope"" in their new releases, giving the listener just a little bit different musical perspective each time a new album is released. I still love this album."
4,"Old House, New Jacks","This worked great for my 1970's house. The adapter is kind of bulky, but it does the job. The jacks were expensive to re-wire, so I bought these. If I do say so myself, it was a good idea!"
3,Great grill pan for the price!,"I purchased this pan after trying a cast iron double grill pan that did not perform to my expectations (it never distributed the heat evenly.)This pan was inexpensive and works very well. I find it to distribute the heat fairly well over one burner, although not perfectly. It cleans very easily, and is great...especially for the price."
3,Works pretty well for the price. Quality is alright.,"For the price I didn't expect much. The pan works pretty well for searing meat. It's so-so if you want to use it to entirely grill meat. The ridges should be taller, although most of these grill pans don't seem to have tall enough ridges. The coating works nicely and washes easily, but from the feel if it, I can't help but predict that it's going to start chipping off long before it ought to. But we'll cross that bridge when we get to it."
3,Made in the USA,"I ordered this item because it was made in the United States, not in China but had to return it. Not sure if it was damaged in shipping or just at the store but the handle was loose and I couldn't tighten it and there was a small scratch on the protective covering. As it turned out, it wasn't as large as I thought it would be. I was glad to see that it was made in the US"
4,"Good, but could be better.","This book was good, but it was basically the same Bruno R. Preiss other and better book: ""Data Structures and Algorithms with Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Java""This book is basically the same book, with a diffrent name, and packaged diffrent for people who don't like to read compiler instructions. If you are interested in this book, you will be better off buying the fore mentioned book above, but in the end the diffrence is so slight that it really doesn't matter."
2,disappointed,"I was very excited to receive this watch. Once I set the time on it I kept feeling like it was running fast. I finally set it to the exact EST time and went back the next day to check. This watch was gaining approx. 10 seconds a day on the actual time. So every week it was gaining approximately 1 minute. After a month this watch was 4-5 minutes faster than true time. I was very disappointed,especially for such a nice and expensive time piece. I returned the watch and will keep looking for a beutiful watch that can also keep time."
4,Great disc. Worth buying at any price.,"Not sure why people always want to compare musical artists to each other, but if you've seen any of the names Greg Laswell has been compared with (Snow Patrol, Coldplay) and enjoy their music, you are almost certainly going to like what Laswell offers.I think his EP, How the Day Sounds, is better, but that doesn't mean I'm not a big fan of Through Toledo. Actually I had it on repeat on my ipod for quite a while.Great lyrics, songs that build and go somewhere, and a voice that you wish you had (unless you're a female, then, maybe not so much) all lead up to a solid album from someone who should be on the radio more often."
5,"Love my ""Cozy Heart""","Product performs as described. I'll mention the size (not noted in the product description) is 11 (eleven) inches across, at the widest point. A nice size to tuck over a sore area. A fun multipurpose pillow."
2,This is a terrible tape,This tape is the same thing they showed on usa abouta year ago. Its terrible and has nothing good in it. Dont buy it
3,Average,This video was a decent video. It kind of lacked in a lot of areas. This video was jumping around to much. If your a fan of survivor series I recomend that you buy Survivor Series 1998! That was with out a doubt the best Surivor Series.
3,It's OK,Theres alot of stuff on Wrestlemania and things 1996 on..theres not alot of old school stuff
1,I cant believe a tape could be that bad,"it had too many interviews and showed one of the elimination matches which were the best. it skipped a few years and didn't even show the bret vs. shawn match.this tape is only 1 hour so w/ the interviews, you probably saw 30 minutes of action. why cant the wwf do their best of tapes like wcw. the best of halloween havoc and the best of bash at the beach are awesome. i would recommend never to buy this tape. it isnt worth a dollar."
3,Not enough and too much,"'Best of Survivor Series 87-97' is one of the most dissapointing wrestling videos i have seen in a while.The Goldust part is almost painful AND they didnt include the rock's debut match-up.Probably the thing with these 'Best of...' videos that irritates me the most is that they have about 5 second clips of the matches which is ridiculous or they have drawn out lengthy bits like the goldust debut!Overall, only get it if your a video collector like me, even than its hard to justify buying but hey for $10-$15 cant expect much."
2,good but SORRY,"Don't get me wrong. I like this video to some extent. They never showed my man the Rock's debute in the federation and that just got me heated. Another thing is that the video was too short for viewing pleasure. Next time, make the video at least 3hrs. long."
3,This video was pretty good.,"The tape was pretty good, but is not as good of the Best of WM. It don't think it even showed clips from the 89 Survivor Series. The tape is an hour long, and that's the problem. 1 hour is not enough time to show clips from 11 events. The Goldust segment is also REALLY bad."
2,[stinks]!,this was a terrible video to watch.best of wrestlemania was better than this.best of survivor series could have been better.psycho sid vs shawn micheals isnt even on the video.they forgot survivor series 92'.the hulk hogamn vs undertaker was a good match.but all they showed was taker beating hulk hogan.and the bret hart vs stone cold showed stone cold beating up bret hart as if he won the match but he actually lost.it was a disaPOniting video dont buy it.
2,WWF BEST OF SURVIVOR SERIES,"I have many WWF home videos and the Best Of videos just aren't worth it. The Best of Wrestlemania is better than this! It has only highlights from a few matches and Vince McMahon lies about the whole 1997 Bret Hart screwjob. 2 1/2 years later and I still can't believe someone could do that. Save your money and get an Austin 3:16 video, a Rock video or the DX or HHH video. Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows was good too."
3,a bit of a letdown,"like many people have said, they left out the bret vs. shawn match from 92, which was a good match, and they also sorta forgot what survivor series was originally about (they basically emphasises only the singles matches)i wouldnt recomend buying this"
2,This tape doesn't concentrate on every Survivor Series,"This tape is almost the same replica of the Best of Survivor Series in 1997 shown on the USA Network. What was really bad that they skipped Survivor Series 88,91,92,. When they said Shawn Michaels made his debut in 89, actually it was in the 88 Survivor Series. They showed to many clips on Hogan/Andre. They didn't even have the right commentary on 89 or 87. They did not include Ventura and too much was spent on the single matches"
3,Leaves you wanting seconds,"If your looking for a calssic moments tape you won't find it here most of the clips are of the guys they have right now and are trying to show the past, classic moments like Warrior and Heenan and teh horrible gobblety gooker are absent but is still worth the money you just might want to get the old videos to see teh classic stuff."
1,This Is A Pretty Bad Tape.,"This Tape Is Not Good. It Shows The 1987, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, And 1997 Events. It Should Have Also Showed The 1988, 1992, And 1995 Events Also. I Also Think That The Bret And Shown Match In 1992 Was Better Then The 1 In 1997. They Also Didn't Show The Casket Match Between The Undertaker And Kamala, And The ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, And Curt Henning, Ric Flair, And Scott Hall Tag Team Match On There. Don't Waste Your Money On This."
2,A poor review,"Nowhere near the quality level of its WrestleMania counterpart. Two huge blunders in this tape: a) the 1992 Survivor Series is left out altogether (that was the event in which Bret Hart wrestled Shawn Micheals for the first time on PPV, one of the greatest Survivor Series matches ever) and b) in discussing the events at the end of the 1997 event, narrator Micheal Cole, with a straight face, proclaims that Bret Hart had let down his fans, his country and his legacy. Footage is then shown of Bret destroying TV monitors. Of course, the reasons behind this are never explained."
1,HORIBLE SAD PATHETIC,I bought this expecting full matches I got a documentry on mainly 4 matches. Andre V Hulk Hogan Undertaker V Hogan Mankind V KaneBret Hart V Shawn Micheals. Theydidn't even show the full match they just showed excerts. You can't fit over 30 hrs of ppv on 1 one hr tape.
1,DISAPPOIINTED,Expensive program with almost no features other than what it says it does. Poor instructions on usage. I have had two months and have yet been unable to successfully utilize.
3,Helps Digestion,I used to take it years ago and I liked the taste and it helped relieve and upset stomach. I was sent the lemon flavour although I ordered the original. I don't know if I will like the taste as I haven't had the chance to use it yet.
2,taste test,"The product is well presented and sealed etc. I have one inquiry which relates to the satisfaction level, namely, why does it have a metallic/horse hoof glue taste to it. Is the fruit salts product formulated the same as the SOUTH AFRICAN ENOS?"
2,this book is the reason I'm buying OTHER books.,"I thought that this book was too clogged with information, and in a messy format. It was very repeatitive, and hard to find what I really wanted. I am hoping that other Visio books will be far better. I am simply trying to learn how to automate code using Visio, and this book was too brief on that subject, and not enough of the info I needed was provided."
2,Not at all helpful,"Like most of the Microsoft manuals, the book assumes you already know all about the subject. But if you know everything about the subject, you don't need the book. Information is very convoluted; not well organized; not very useful."
3,I'd love to review it but...,The product hasn't arrived. The seller hasn't returned my emails. And now I'm out the money for the product and I don't have the book for my project at work.
1,PLEASE READ !,"I purchased this book while on vacation as it looked like a good book to read at the beach. The book reviews on the 1st couple of pages looked great but ...I am sorry I did not open it and read a few pages. It is a book that is full of extremely bad language ...#%*#...not my style. It is not well done. I am tired of authors and movie directors who think the average guy on the street wants this kind of trash...To make matters worse the author teaches college literature. He should know better. this is not literature...pure trash. The College of the Atlantic in Maine can do much better. I cannot believe I am the 1st person to give this book the review it deserves. I would have given it 0 stars if this were an option...If a book full of 4 letter words is your style, go for it. But when your kids start to talk this way- don't blame their friends. I am taking a stand and burning this book instead of trading it at a used book store."
1,no passion for truth in this book,"Another example of a falsified quote is on p. 47 where they quote George Wald from his '54 Scientific American article (also reprinted in a later Scientific American compilation volume). The words in the book are not Wald's words at all but a crude paraphrase. Apparently the authors didn't read the actual article themselves, even though they referenced it. And the paraphrase gave a false impression of what Wald said in that article. It made him sound like an immoral hypocrite, and it gave an impression that was the opposite of the actual point of the article.So they were not passionate enough for truth to check their sources to make sure the quotes they used were accurate. And they were willing to use a brief quote without even knowing or caring what the context was, or what the author had to say."
5,read the bible from end to end,"read the Bible from end to end...for those that were offended by this book, all your claims are defensive. did this book touch a nerve? evolutionists -- you cant make claims against the Bible without reading it first with an open mind...."
1,Holy Crap This is utter TRASH,"A Christian friend showed me this book, which he proudly displays on a shelf like a trophy of his ignorance. The ""facts"" in this book are utterly wrong, wrong wrong, and this book is just a complete mess. However, I would actually promote buying this book, as it is absolutely hilarious to intellectuals"
1,This book is filled with ignorance,"I swear, how does such manure get published? I can't believe that people actually believe this stuff? I suppose it's a sad state of affairs, if the stuff in this book is taken as anything other then psuedoscience.Aren't our children learning anything in school? Who would believe this creationist nonsense? A 6k year old earth? You'd have to be completely braindead to believe that! We've got plenty of accurate dating methods, in addition to ice-core samples, tree rings, and the stumper of all time: If the earth is 6k years old, how did anything survive the massive amounts of meteor's (attested to by the craters found on earth)? We'd all be dead, if the earth was 6k years old.Anyone who reviewed this positively is either: A YEC, or hopelessly ignorant. In either case-DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!!"
1,Not hematite,"This item was not hematite. The ball ends had a shiny coating that came off within a week. I was allergic to what ever metal was underneath. It was definately not surgical steel, like the bar. Ended up with a refund because they didn't have anything genuine hematite to replace it with. Or so I was told. Was very disappointed."
4,Great Debut...,"I saw Rhett Miller when he opened up for Tori Amos in San Antonio. First I wasn't sure who he was, but as he played I realized that he was really very sweet and had heartwrenching lyrics. I really loved the one man show, its nice to hear artists on thier own. What sucked was that a girl from the audience ran to the stage and demanded a hug. And when he refused, she started throws cups on stage.(some people just shouldn't drink...)"
5,Old 97s go pop,"Great CD! Every single song is strong. Very intelligent, literate lyrics and they've all got a hook. This is a great ""pop"" album (in the good sense of ""pop"")."
4,Pure Pop for Grown Up People,"What we have here is a batch of intelligent, well written, well played, well sung pop songs. No, it's not the twangy punk of early Old 97s or the British Invasion-twinged rock of ""Satellite Rides"". It's just not the Old 97s. Get over it. I'll probably get slaughtered for saying it but this CD reminds me quite a bit of the acoustic/electric pop on The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame About Ray"".There are some songs in the typical ""boy meets girl/girl breaks boys heart"" vein that Rhett mines to good effect. He even has a little fun at his own expense on ""This Is What I Do"" claiming that singing about heartbreak is ""what I do for a living"". There's a beautiful acoustic ballad in ""World Inside The World"", one faintly Old 97s song about love and mass transportation, ""The El""."
1,bogus love ballads,"Rhett, your face looks reeeel pretty on the face of a record, but jeez, bring back Murry and the boyz? I miss the raw energy streaming from the early old 97s records. What has happened to the clever lyrics and pleasing rock twangs coming from the good ole boys. This album sings sell-out poppy love ballads. Don't buy it!"
1,Sold Out,"Every Old 97's song has ingenious lyrics and a uniquely catchy tune. I can't believe the lead singer of Old 97's and this Rhett Miller guy who opens for Tori Amos (I didn't even know she toured anymore) are one in the same. It is a good thing Old 97's are so wonderful because Rhett almost ruined everything for me. His solo CD has that old familiar sold out ring to it, the lyrics are weak, and I couldn't be more disappointed. Did I mention all the songs sound the same? It didn't matter if the Old 97's never made it to the big time (eventhough it seems they were getting closer and closer). They were a solid band unlike any other, and it is a shame Miller compromised that for a few fleeting moments in his not-so-bright lime light."
1,Rhett is a sellout,"This album sucks and so does Rhett's solor career. He left a great band (Old 97's) to produce this crap? Rhett, a little advice, get back to rockin' and stop this lovie dovie crap that is obviously meant to turn you into a teenage attraction."
2,better than matchbox twenty but that's not saying much,"better than 70% of the crap that's out there, but not up to snuff for a songwriter who has demonstrated extraordinary abilities on his work with the old 97's. do yourself a favor and buy one of their albums instead."
4,Livens up any mix.....,"Got to hear the stripped down versions of many of thesefine cuts recently during Rhetts opening of Tori Amos's tour in New Hampshire.I most likely would have passed this all by if itweren't for our local Triple AAA stations playingthe hell out of ""Come around"" his first single on""The Instigator"", great cut too! Just hearing the studio versions of thesejust made many of these cuts come to life and I'm also enjoyinghis last studio effort with his band, the 97's (Satiellite Rides)as well. Having discovered this singer now I want to listen to Rhett and his band. Just watching this guy and his quirky moves and hishonest songs about love and the lack of it is a kick, a greatfind, sick of the radio anymore!!"
2,Pure Pablum Pop for the Masses,"This CD was a real disappointment. I was familiar with Rhett Miller's Old 97's work, which was edgy and clever. Unfortunately, his solo effort is neither of these things. The lyrics are standard love song drivel with none of Miller's usual clever twists. Occasionally he seems like he's trying for a clever twist, but it just comes off as trite. Musically this album sounds like any number of mediocre one-hit-wonder pop bands. Deep Blue Something and The Rembrandts come to mind. Perhaps Miller should write a TV-theme-song or something as his next effort. Sad."
3,um...ok,"Well, it's obvious that Rhett has fallen in love....with cliches! The tunes are perfectly crafted to suit the best of pop songs, but the lyrics? Give me a break! The same old tired trite turn of phrase repeated over and over ad nauseam does not make for a great song or show any imagination whatsoever. He wrote better lyrics when he was little teeny bopper folkie. He can do better.This would have been better had it been released as an instrumental."
2,a big disappointment,"I'm a big fan of the OLD 97s... but this new CD from Rhett has very little in common w/ the music his old band used to put out. If Rhett wants to 'go another direction' w/ his music, that's just fine. But if your a fan of the OLD 97s... be warned, & I'd seriously advise you steer clear of this cheesey CD. This poppy self indulgent effort is only for girls who think Rhett is dreamy."
1,"Too Far To 'Who"" Cares","Rhett should be stripped naked, placed in front of the many dissapointed Old 97's fans and then beaten. No, this is not the Old 97's. No, Old 97 fans will not like this CD. No, you should not buy this. My therapists said I should be more positive so yes, the Old 97's will be back because Rhett's solo career will be over faster then a Chevy Chase late night talk show. YOU... RHETT!!"
4,"Hey, I'm Not In A Band","Rhett Miller has always been the type of songwriter that writes about simple things in life such as; love found, love lost, falling in love, and girl trouble;(we all have felt all of those at one point or another in our life). But now with hsi first solo album, Miller covers those same topics but in a way that the Old 97's could not.The record starts off with the giant 'Our Love', a great ditty about 2 people who don't belong together but are deeply in love none the less. You can tell a slight resemblence to the Old 97's, but don't be fooled, Rhet Miller has found his own solo voice.The only downer that I see in this record is the cover. Rhett looks like a pretty boy rock star, he has more character than that. Come on Rhett, if looks sold records, Pamela Anderson would have multi platinum records by now."
5,Fun in the Sun or the Moonlight,"Pam, Sam, Jill and Will are very hot and need to find a way to cool off. They decide to bike to the beach, but get lost and side tracked along the way. It's an adventure that will take your little ones imagination on a ride they will not soon forget. I loved the brightly colored illustrations and the way they made the ending a happy one despite all the bumps in the road.I would recommend this book for children who really like to look at the pictures and for those who are very young. Even too young for early readers really, but a fun story none the less!!By Kerri J. BusteedAuthor of Will's First HuntWill's First Hunt"
5,Abrasive early Cabs,"This is NOT the dance oriented CV of the 90s, this is Sheffield industrial music.From the trhobbing pulse of VOA to the fingers-on-the-blackboard opening of Premonition this is industrial like momma used to make. The only weak track is the Casio-preset beatbox of If Shadows Could March"" Recommended"
2,"At best, uninspiring. At worst, boring.","We see too many stories of homophobia and, to me, this movie was no different from the usual macho-posturing of closet queers. Didn't enjoy it and wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good Coming-Out Story On Its Own Terms,"Most coming-out movies are either unrealistically cheery or overwhelming depressing. This is well-nuanced middle ground set in 1982. If you can look past the soft-core porn aspects, the misleading cover image and some of the heavy handed see-this-is-Texas touches, the story is compelling and deft, for the most part. The real story is not in the sex, but three young men coming to terms with their sexual identities in the early 80s. There's awkwardness and fear here, and to the credit of the film makers, they are not obscured by cheesy, cheap cliches. The atmospherics of life in the early 80s are well placed, aside from a few spurious ""awesomes"" dropped (only valley girls were using the term then), and it is a bittersweet snapshot just before the plague. This movie is very good for what it is, and it explores, albeit without much depth, some of the shadowland between ""straight"" and ""gay"" men that we see handled with mastery in ""Gods and Monsters""."
1,Didn't like it,"The acting in this was terrible, I've seen better in school plays. There was some eye candy here and there but nothing impressive."
4,Gift for friend!,"Never viewed DVD myself. Friend it was a gift for said it was great. We all enjoy different things, thats good I guest."
4,Funny movie,This is a funny movie - good to just enjoy and laugh. Glad I didn't live in TX in the 80s but so e people had fun....
3,Cute little campy story,"College in Texas in the 1980s must have been really odd. If you are a fan of an actor in this film, then buy it for your collection.....if not, an online rental may just be a smart first viewing."
5,"great download, movie",I downloaded this movie and loved it! It is over the top campy but i liked it. It downloaded fast and great quality. this was a great movie
3,Good,The movie is very good but the characters could be developed a little more. I viewed it several times and enjoy watching the good looking men in it. It lack depth. The movie started several situations but never finished them.
1,Can't We Rate Lower Than 1 Star?,"It's a tough call: Which is worse, the acting or the writing? When all is said and done it's a coin flip...they're both hideous. The only [slight] redeeming point of the whole project is Dylan Vox, but soooooooo not worth the price of the DVD."
1,"Oh, I Only Watched It After Renting The Bomb","You'll probably recognize some of these actors frommovies over the past decade;seems like good acting Gay parts are hard to findas you'll find if you waste a dime renting this film.Bad storyline, terrible acting and the sex scenes;I guess some people will like but:""embarrassing"" would be a good word to describe this disaster.Why not rent some great Gay moviesfull of sexy guys with good story linessuch asBoy CultureorLatter Days"
1,waste of money,"horrible acting, and story. I didn't have high expectations to start with, unfortunately ""gay themed"" movies tend to have lower quality acting, etc. This one, however, was one of the worst. save your money."
3,Longhorns and there boys,"This was not the best of flicks.It could have been better.The boys looked hot an all, But therewas something missing"
2,Nothing here,"Except for the cute smile and sexy drawl of the main character, there isn't much to see here -- including nudity if that's what you're looking for. A very weak story line with marginal acting. The female characters are especially pitiful, and seem to have been thrown in just because they had to be. A waste of time."
1,Dewalt 18V XRP,"Out remodeling company bought (1) 6-tool Dewalt 18V and (1) 6 tool Makita 18V cordless tool systems. The Makita is truly industrial quality and the DeWalt a poser. Had to have both side by side to truly judge the difference. If Makita was as good as Dewalt is in marketing tools, Dewalt would soon be out of business!!"
1,pro vision sucks,"I ordered my product over a month ago and still haven't received it. They don't even answer emails asking about it. I can't rate the item,I never received it."
5,you know it,"this is awesome, fits on any shifter with a straight shaft. put electrical tape on the shaft before tightening the screws into it. awesome addition, way better than the vinyl stock shift knob, nice smooth leather and says momo italy on the palm side of the shift knob. peace"
4,Good. Easy to install. Leather only ok.,The long shift knob is easy to install. Ergonomically comfortable. The leather however is not a nice soft leather like my last shift knob.
3,Rather disappointed,"While the product I purchased was what I needed, I felt the shipping and handling charges were excessive, especially since the shipping cost was higher then the cost of the what I'd purchased.Sadly, because of the excessive s&h; charge I will simply be a one time only customer.No repeat business from me. Gouging is not good customer relations."
4,Characters Are The Key In November Storm,NOVEMBER STORM by Elizabeth Housey combines mystery with outlandish characters and tongue-in-cheek action. An enjoyable read that was over far too quickly. I look forward to a sequel.
2,"good, for a text book","I am finding more and more that text books give the worst account of history. This book proved that point. For an overview of the history of psychology, the book was okay. However, I found many times that the theories of the psychologists were so watered down, one can hardly get a good idea of their original studies and propositions. I know it is difficult to read each and every work of each and every psychologist, but this text book is a waste of time for anyone who really wants to understand how ideas developed. In addition, I get really annoyed when writers do not quote the original author. Most of the quotes in this book were taken from other text books or biographers."
4,History of Psychology Shipment,The textbook was in fairly good condition. The book cover was fairly banged up. That mightbe due to less than careful handling by the postal people and not necessarily the person sending the book.
4,good buy,"Product was in good condition. Price was good. Took a little longer than I expected to receive it, but was within the estimated window, so I guess I can't complain. Overall, glad I bought this text here rather than paying an exorbitant amount at a bookstore."
3,Verbose,"The book, from a historical view point, is concise. However, it is inundated with extraneous information and overstated detail, leaving one yawn-inspired. I am a psyche major and even my professor agreed that this text was rather verbose. It was his first semester instructing a hx of psyche course and he claims he will not be incorporating this text into future sessions."
4,Liked it so much we ordered 3,"We bought this light for our 2nd floor bathroom thinking that it was cheap but that bathroom wouldn't get used much, but when we got it we liked it so much that we sent back the more expensive lights that we bought for our Master Bath and bought 2 more of these. Great light, we really like them and the price is just a bonus! :)We would recommend."
3,Medievalish,"This CD is good. My parents listen to it. I think it's interesting to listen to. It's sort of soothing too. It is simple music, so it's nice to listen to. I recommend this CD for people who like classical without the piano, because this CD is guitar."
5,After few times I suddenly said WOW!,"Some times ago I got this CD, I admit that at first I didn't think it is so good, but after a while - well, all I can tell you is that you really have to listent to this magnificent achievment of those four great artists. There are few tracks I would remove - but not because they are not good. I would remove them because personally I wouldn't give part of a whole piece like the Allegro from the 3 Brendenburg concerto or the 3 fugue from the ""well tempered clavier"" (where is the prelude?) however, the Los Angeles Guitar Quarter play so fluently, so sencitively... listen and admire! Especially I would like to note the 6 Brendenburg Concerto, the Handel's ""The arrival of the queen of Sheba"" and the Monteverdiana. I warmly recomand this cd."
3,"Nice item, but honestly, no great shakes","OK, it is a serving tray. It matches the dishes I purchased which are terrific by the way. But for some reason, the picture above led me to believe this tray would be stainless. It is instead a simple white plastic tray. Considering how elegant the rest of the French Quarter items are, I was kinda disappointed with this item. Stick to the French Quarter dishes and glassware, no matter how tempted you are to buy each and every item to complete your collection. :)"
5,"Dance, Dance, Dance!","From the very beginning, this CD had me dancing! After starting with the particularly excellent ""It Feels So Good,"" Sonique continues with her own blend of infectious dance/pop which will blow your mind! Although not all the songs are dance-oriented, those that are make the purchase all the more worthwhile. This is one of the best CD's I own, and I certainly recommend it."
5,I found it!!,"I been looking for this Album and Artist for the past 4+ years!! A friend had lent me this cd and i fell in love with it. I moved lost touch with him and couldnt remember the name of the artist or the titles. I kept searching for Solange instead of Sonique,lol. But just now while checking emails her name popped into my head completely out of nowhere. This is a great album. i think all the songs are hot."
4,The New Dancefloor Diva!,"Lately, mainstream techno-dance has been very generic (aside from notable exceptions such as Pet Shop Boys, Madonna). Most songs employing redundantly similar arrangements, sounds etc. Sonique's lead off single ""It Feels So Good"" (the clear standout and commercial hook on the album) literally breathes new life into its own genre. Sonique's soulful, breathy vocals work wonderfully with the techno-laced material on this effort. Although the album is quite varied with r&b, dance, soul and trip hop influences throughout; It may take you a couple of full and complete listens to get past the first track and into the rest of the album, but once you do, it's an infectious journey through the music. Some standout tracks (aside from the first single) are: ""I Put A Spell On You"", ""Are You Ready"", ""Cold and Lonely"", ""Move Closer"" and ""Love Is On Our Side"". Overall, a strong effort from the new dancefloor diva! Happy Listening!"
2,severely disappointed,I never ever bought a cd that I only knew of one song from that cd. I figured I would take the chance..and I got burned! I was utterly disappointed with this album! The only REALLY good song on this album..is Feel So Good. This is the first time that I was disappointed with any cd I ever bought. I wish I can get my money back for this disappointing cd. It sure wasn't worth it!
3,Go all the Way!,"I truly believe that if you're going to release a MEGA-HIT like ""Feels So Good"". I'm looking for a back up song! Though she has some nice electronica tracks, they don't compare to Feels So Good. This is still a great cd ! They even threw in a few nice R&B-like cuts, but don't be fooled! This cd isn't R&B at all! Let's just say it's electronica for the millenium! I mean if you're going to release a track like ""Feels So Good"", GO ALL THE WAY and start from there! Don't mix up the cd with pop & r&b tracks! Sometimes diversity will kill a cd! Sonique survives! That's all that matters!"
4,Fall Under Sonique's Spell,"""It Feels So Good"" begins what might be one of the most interesting dance releases of 2000. With her unique voice, Sonique captivates her audience with her blend of electronica/dance/r&b. ""I Put A Spell On You"" is a throbbing house track, while ""Are You Ready"" is 70s soul funk. ""Move Closer"" is a sensual journey into late night clubbing. The reggae-tinged ""Can't Get Enough"" is another winner on the CD, which could be a single soon. ""Love Is On Our Side"", produced by the famous Thunderpuss 2000 team, is really a hit waiting to happen. The end of the CD slows it down, with ""Sky"", a great pop song which could also be a hit, and ""Learn To Forget"", a piano-based ballad which I can also see as a single. This is a solid packaging of songs that show off Sonique's great original voice."
3,ATTENTION SONIQUE FANS: THIS CD MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU THINK,"I am a die hard Sonique fan, I think shes cool. ""It feels so good"" is one of my favorite songs, even after it has been played out by my local radio stations. I bought this cd because I thought it would be much like ""It feels so good."" Well, it wasn't. I have a hard time rating this cd, because it is good, but not what I thought it was going to be so I am dissappointed. Go to a record store and listen to this CD before you buy it. Sonique is a much more diverse artist than I thought and it shows on this albulm. Best of Luck Sonique"
3,Better than expected!,"About the half of the songs are good. The best one is the over-catchy disco tune ""love is on our side"", it just blow me away. It feels so good, cold and lonely and Sky are very pleasing to (allthough I cant think of ""sky"" as something else than a parody...the most silly and banal lyrics I have heard!). Modern rnb tune ""Drama"" is a lot better than most of things in the same category I hear on radio (I dont listen to radio=). This album is maybe a little underrated."
3,An Average Dance/Techno Album,"Sonique is one of the new artists out there. The songs on this CD are pretty good especially It Feels So Good, Cold And Lonely, Can't Get Enough, and Sky. The rest are okey, but you might want to avoid the song, Are You Ready. That song is sort of annoying, and sounds like a 70's song. That might appeal to some people, but not to me. This album is not bad overall."
2,I Cried When I Heard It,"There's a weird seventies vibe to Soniques dance pop schlock. She seems to mix in funk, techno, seventies snyth (including slight vocal synthing) and a dash of theatrical musical pretension. Add it all up and you get the blahs, stick to En Vogue."
4,Loved it at the full moon ....,"Would love to hear ""it feels so good"" Again !!!Can't spare the cd though ... bummer ...Might go under and mp3 it ...Sorry sonique ...But that song rocks !!! ;]"
3,Know Your DVD Jabroni,"This was without a doubt, my favorite Rock video when it was on vhs...however the dvd fails to live up to what I had imagined. As is the problem for the older WWF videos now being released on dvd (Rock Bottom 1998 for example), this dvd lacks a menu for access to chapters or various extra features. I wouldn't so much have minded the lack of extras, there couldn't really have been any. But I want to be able to skip to the next scene without having to fast forward a half an hour. I do like ""Know Your Role,"" but the makers of this dvd should have known their roles and made some chapters."
3,rock from big time to sell out,the rock was good he was good talker but not that great wrestler no aj styles/kurt angle ric flair etc but this video was ok peoples champ is much better dvd all i got to say is he sold out he wants notin to do with wrestling he is done lol wwe was gonan give him a 3 disc set and all he had to do was show up at 4 shows lol free plane ticket food etc he said no so now he dont get dvd lol ok sc*** him he sold out he dosesnt care bout wwe or wrestling lol ok next he was on raw yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy its the rock on raw calling umaga a name who cares he wasnt there he was doing a interview on the dvd families if i were u id buy it to relive the rock in his good respectable days but u no what he sold out i wouldnt buy it ether waste of money on a guy who sold outsincerly LDL
4,"Good, but to little wrestling.","A knock-out video. Although there were to little wrestling, but very good when he speaks about the persona he's playing."
2,Too much If ya smellllll what the Rock is cookin,"This video is basically an hour of the Rock running nursery rhymes and playing silly games. However it does adequately cover the fueds with the HHH, Mankind and Austin. The bottom line is if you have seen all the WWF PPV's with The Rock against HHH, Mankind and Austin. Then you have already seen what this whole video is about. It does go back in time when The Rock was with the Nation though and that was somewhat interesting. B- from me."
5,Excellent Toy,I ordered the Kid Galaxy Cobra Radio-Controlled Land/ Water Vehicle for my great-nephew. It was sent in perfect condition and arrived only a couple of days after I ordered it. My nephew just loves playing withhis radio-controlled car and it's his favorite toy.Thank you.
4,Good value...,"These are cool remote controls for the money and my grandkids seem to like them. I got 3, one for both my grandkids and one for their dad so everybody could play together. NOT POSSIBLE. Not exactly the toy's fault, but all three came with the same frequency so they can't be used at the same time. Each controller operates all the vehicles. NOT happy about that and have returned two and gotten the entry level Air Hog remote control airplanes. Even a 4 yr old can use the Air Hog and have a rip roaring great time. This vehicle is okay, but we only kept one of the three. Runs okay indoors, but this is snow country and we haven't been able to take them outside yet."
2,Not Good n Water,"I bought two of these, one for a birthday present for a friend's kid, and one for my own son. The first one out of the box had issues with one of the wheels not turning, so I set it aside to test the second which seemed to operate okay. Good thing I test toys before I give them as gifts! Wrapped the second one up and haven't heard any news from my friend. However, we were able to fix the first one because the cheap Chinese plastic/rubbery wheels were easy to remove and shave off some excess material that was keeping the wheel from turning. Good thing I'm handy. We have tried this car many tmes in the water and continue to be disappointed. It barely moves in the water and if any current or wave catches it, the vehicle is a goner. On land it's okay on smooth ground, but cannot even run on grass or make it over the smallest obstacle. I will give it an A+ for durability because we have put this car to the test with mud and water and it is still running."
3,Mediocre Dies at best,"I purchased these Hornady dies to reload for my 444 Marlin Encore, they are my first set of Hornady dies and likely my last. There are two things I don't like about the dies. The first dislike is the ""zip spindle"" the threads are so shallow that unless you really tighten down on the locking nut the decapping pin slips, I prefer a full thread to hold the pin because it's much more solid and reliable. The second thing I don't like is the box, why they didn't just put the dies in a standard size box like their competitors use is beyond me. The finish of the dies is pretty good and the dies are functional I just feel their design is inferior to RCBS and Redding dies, I've been reloading a long time so maybe I'm just old school but it wasn't broke and I'd prefer that Hornady hadn't tried to fix it."
2,Great when it Works,"This is the second one I've owned. The first lasted almost three years the second one about a year. They make fine waffles, however there is no timer or browning settings. If you over add the recipe, it will make a mess. The biggest issue is reliability. The first just died, no lights nothing. This one the lights come on but it no longer heats. I believe it has a faulty safety. I never immersed them just wiped them down."
4,Glorious romantic comedy even more fascinating than it seems,"On one level this is a delightfully refreshing romantic comedy from, despite its title, a female point of view, as three sisters (and a sexually insecure brother) are transformed by their relationship with a mysterious, beautiful stranger (shades of 'Theorem', and Stuart Townsend is a ringer for the young Stamp).Told in four witness accounts, Adam's personality, filtered by others' subjectivity, becomes the central mystery, so that the film is less 'about' Adam than asking, what is Adam about? Set in a fantasy, middle-class Dublin in a swinging 60s stylee, the film exhilerates and amuses, proving Frances O'Conner to be unequalled among young actresses today, and Kate Hudson quite easily, and adorably, living up to the hype.On another, less obvious, level, 'About Adam' is a stringent satire-cum-warning about the complacency and selfishness of Ireland's new economy boom. But that's just me."
1,Sad and depressing. All about cheating,Kate is great in this movie but the movie itself is completely dysfunctional. I so so dissappointed. It was a complete waste of money. The guy sleeps with pretty much everyone in the family and no one tells her and she ends up marrying him.
5,Sexy and Hilarious!,"When I initially looked at the description of this film I thought it would be a sweet, average, romantic comedy--maybe the description was misleading me into renting it--but once I popped the tape into the VCR I fell in love with ""About Adam."" Some think Hudson's role in ""Almost Famous"" was her best, thus far, but ""About Adam"" is even better! It's the most fun I've had on a Friday night in a long time. I laughed and absolutely fell in love with each and every character. Stuart Townsend is my new favorite actor and I can't wait to see him in more films. If you want a wonderfully sexy movie with more laughs than you can handle buy ""About Adam""!!!!!!!"
4,"Adam, it seems, has a BIG problem ...","... he can't seem to keep his zipper up! Now in real life, this would be a problem. But in the movies, this sort of thing can be very funny, for a person with an open mind such as myself. Adam shags basically anyone with 2 legs - dudes are not excluded. Stuart Townsend smiles, smirks, grins, his way through this entire movie, looking like he's having the time of his life while doing so. We find out at the end of the movie why he is the way he is. His simple statement of fact: ""It just makes me happy to make other people happy"". Hey, I'm all for that, and though I wouldn't go around humping people to prove my point, I'm all for helping my fellow man :)I really liked this movie, a friend recommended it to me, and I'm glad she did. I think it is very good, I'm not sure I would call it excellent, but I did enjoy it very much, and was worth the price to buy & own."
2,Not that funny!,"I was excited when I came across this movie because it's a comedy set in Ireland and made by the BBC. Although, it's somewhat intriguing it sadly lacks good humour. You might be mildly entertained by the psychology of suduction, but if you're looking for a good laugh and a warm fuzzy feeling - that one might expect from a 'romantic comedy'- then this is not for you. The Irish/British connection made me think of wonderful movies like the Commitments, Snatch, The Matchmaker, Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Return to Me. This isn't in the same league!"
1,what a pile of crap,"a guy who sleeps with the sisters of his fiancee, and I suspect even her mom and brother. Even half an hour before he is to be wed he shags the bride's oldest sister. Absolutely disgusting.than we have the problem Kate Hudson. I've seen a couple of her movies, and from now on I will just avoid movies she's in. No talent.She's into copying the ""cuteness"" of her mom Goldie Hawn in all the movies she's in, so it seems. And highly irritating.About Adam is a waste of good time. Avoid it."
3,Gets better as it unfolds,"At first, we suspect the something about Adam is that he is gay. But actually, it's that he is terminally hetero, with every female in his circle, including the sister and girlfriend of the real girlfriend he's about to marry. I enjoyed this Lothario tale, set in Ireland. The message is decidedly non-PC. In fact, the film seems to celebrate Adam's serial cheating as his merely getting the most enjoyment out of life. It was a tad silly."
5,Check it out Y'all!!!,The first time saw this movie was on digital cable. I came across it when I was flipping through channels & I recogonized Stuart Townsend(Could he be anymore hotter?!?!?!?!?) so I decided to watch & it was way better than I expected. Kate Hudson & Frances O'Connor were hecka cool in this movie. I love how you see Adam through different perspectives except his own throughout the movie. I got to see a few times again when i rented it on video & that time around I noticed things I didn't notice the first time I saw the movie. This movie is hecka funny & clever! It made want get in touch with my Irish roots.
5,An object believed to have sexual powers,"An object of excessive attention or reverance...Fixation....This is Fetish. With that definition in mind, the hard rocking chords kick off an undeniable foray into the deviant world of S&M. I have a totally different viewpoint than the other reviewer of this single, and one I think needed to be seen. If you have had the pleasure of seeing Joan Jett sing this song live, you would know, it comes from within. This is no sales gimmik, no attempt to carve a new niche, this is Joan! Pure, hard-core, honest Joan Jett. She sweats each note out with every pore in her body and enjoys the reaction that is returned from the listening ears! I have never witnessed anyone, and I am talking non-fans, that haven't left wanting more! She rocks harder and better today than ever before! Now, if mainstream radio just would have such an open mind!!! BUY THIS, or better yet, buy the compilation disc that this song is included on!"
3,what?,"I don't quite understand this Nick Cave album. You can hear some vocal melodies similar to the kind of weird stuff the Talking Heads were doing in the late 70's combined with freak out Alice Cooper-like choruses. Supposed to be a post-punk album, but feels more like a sloppy heavy metal one. I don't know if I can recommend something that's barely in tune, much less melodic. This is just.... weird, but not in a good way."
3,Its either his best or his worst album,"It depends on your point of view. If you like your Cave tuneful then this is not really for you, but if you liked 'The Birthday Party' then buy this. Personally I would differ from the other reviwers on this page because this is not my favourite Cave album. I think it is undisciplined in comparison to his later work (check out The Forstborn is Dead for progress in that direction). I don't think the band have quite discovered their direction,(Punk? Blues? Art Rock?) at this point. The cover of 'In the Ghetto' sits very unconfortably with the other stuff. This album sounds like the birth of The Bad Seeds in many ways. In my opinion the best songs are 'Well of Misery', which is a taster of the evil blues to come on later albums, the fantastic cover of Cohen's 'Avalanche', the poetic racket that is 'Saint Huck' and of course the undoubted masterpiece 'From Her to Eternity'."
3,Guilty pleasures,"I know, Nick Cave is a demigod and all that, novelist, screenwriter, director, collaborator with Marianne Faithful (who also knew how to do maudlin to death), but seriously? Seriously? He's hamming it up all over this album. If you read the liner notes, you'll think he invented music out of nothing, like some Nordic Prometheus from Down Under. I prefer to think these kids got high, turned off the lights in the studio, lit flashlights under their chins, and cranked out this noise. Which should sound like more fun, now that you mention it. I guess guilt is harder to purge than we all would like to admit... though if you want to hear the audio equivalent of having sex while trapped in a cramped metal locker in a hot desert warehouse, I suggest Track 2."
2,How to,"All this CD had on it was how to play the table for the dancer and the various beats and combination of beats. I thought I was getting actual bellydance music, not a how to. Wish I hadn't bought it."
4,Great guitar-playing and strong song-writing,"Cool CD. The guitar playing is especially good, with influences of Alex Lifeson, John Petrucci, and Ty Tabor. Lots of vocal melodies to sing along with. Excellent hard rock with a definite progressive edge."
1,Nothing Exciting Here...,"As a former member of the Westminster Choir, I can honestly say there is nothing interesting or exciting about this recording. First of all, Flummerfelt must be getting old because his tempi are ungodly slow, sometimes not even following the composer's own marking. Though the over all sound is ""Westminster"" the drama, flair, colors, and texture of the group is nil. If you're looking for either the Love Songs or Gypsy Song cycles, keep searching...this is not the recording for you. If you are a Brahms enthusiast, I also recommend you keep searching, there is nothing remotely interesting about this recording."
2,"Not as good as ""Tell the World""","We have Hillsongs ""Tell the World"" and kids and adults alike all love it!So we waited in eager anticipation for this DVD to arrive from Amazon. However when it arrived we couldn't contain our disappointment. None of us really like this DVD. Our 3 year old boy who dances away to Tell the World was not impressed. Our 9 and 11 year old girls who also like Tell the World walked out of the room due to lack of interest."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"I just got back from Pat's CD release concert and am once again impressed and amazed by the band. Shine is a wonderful combination of old and new Pat McGee songs, although my favorite, ""Girl from Athens"" isn't on this CD. I really like ""Anybody"". Thank you for making beautiful music."
5,This is only a taste...,"This was the first Pat McGee Band cd I listened to, and for those of you who aren't hooked yet, it's a great way to get started. This album is filled with beautiful lyrics which are backed my catching tunes and rhythms. Onced you've memorized all the words, move on to their live albums and buy some concert tickets ASAP!! Their albums are all great, but they can't compare to seeing them in person. Their vivacity on stage is remarkable. They play from the heart and all of their songs have meaning behind them. As you will hear on this album, their voices are incredible, their harmonies are perfect, and they're all genuinely talented musicians. Listen to this album over and over again, it just gets better and better!"
4,Shine-Appropriate Title,"Shine is an appropriate title for the new album from the bearers of the Allman Brothers standard. In comparison to their previous work, Pat McGee Band has added quite a bit more polish to their sound. That's not to say I don't like it. From the first track, ""Runaway,"" this album just makes you want to get up and dance. It's so uplifting and fun, while preserving the great musicianship that the band has always had. The southern rock of the band has taken on a little more of a pop sound, which is expected, this being a major-label album. The one thing you don't see, though, is the band selling out, as bands like Vertical Horizon have. They keep that beautiful acoustic rock sound that has been there from the beginning, and just add a few more layers. I've had the pleasure of meeting these guys, and they're all like their music: very nice. Although the tracks do tend to start sounding the same after a while, this is still a wholly enjoyable album by an excllent band."
4,Solid Rock 'n Roll...,"A solid studio album, from the one of the best live bands around. The latest version of ""Rebecca"" sounds great. ""Hero"" is awesome, and the guitar work on ""Haven't Seen for Awhile"" is better than ever. Pat really shows some vocal range on the title cut, and the sultry Dire Straits-ish instrumental at the end of ""I Know"" is superb. Check ""Shine"" out, then go see these guys live, for a real treat."
4,THIS IS IT!!,"If you read the amazon.com review, you would be lead to believe this cd has little to offer. Does it have some lyrics we could live without? Yes.Even so, these guys don't dissapoint. I love the songs ""Lost"" and ""I Know"". These guys have captured that laid back southern rock sound very well. The reviewer mentions Hootie and the Blowfish. Amazon.com, shut up-a-you-face! Darius has a lot of talent, but these guys blow them away. They remind me more of a Crosby, Stills, and Nash. They have great harmonies and a sound that is both rooted in tradition and unique.I play guitar and write songs for fun. These guys could improve some of the weird lyrics. The faster songs sound a little too country for my taste. Even so, if you want a great cd to put for a relaxing drive in the summer...This is it!"
4,Shined,"In a nutshell this assembly of words into music harnesses many great experiences and feelings. I had the chance to see Pat perform as a solo artist and with his band mates on numerous occasions. What really brings their music to life is their live performances. I describe PMB as Crosby, Stills & Nash meets James Taylor in a modern day setting.Shine is a combination of new and old tracks in a high tech studio environment. I think you are seeing only the beginning of what will be a great career in music for PMB.I hope you receive the same satisfaction when you hear this CD.Enjoy!"
5,Mickey & The Soul Generation ~ IRON LEG,"This is music from a time when music was made to be enjoyed. You can hear the fun these musicians had in making the recordings. The genius of it is that you, the listener, come away with a great feeling in your soul and the wanting to dance your life away. You can hear their livies through the tracks; the awaking of life, the protests of injustice they found themselves in, and finally coming to full circle: finding their ownselves. If you liked the Meters and AWB you will find this ablum to your liking."
2,I wasn't impressed.,"I was test driving them as a possible fruit of the month choice for 2007. Their club is over 100.00 more than Harry and David, but I thought perhaps they were just that much better. I was wrong. I could have bought this flavorless fruit from any local grocery store. Don't be lured by the talk of boxes with water-colored artwork. I've seen better on the free calendar that my Pharmacist gives me."
2,Not Impressed!,The photo in the description shows and abundance of fruit but when the fruit arrived it only contained 6 pieces. I was embarrassed because I sent it as a gift.....
2,Misleading info...beware,"I had a gift certificate and I ordered these fruits as a gift for family. From the description and picture given, it seemed like a nice idea. WhenI received the fruit I was surprised that it only contained 6 pieces. I scrutinized the listing to see if I had made a mistake...nope, the picture had shown at least 12 pieces of fruit and nothing in the description mentioned anything different.I called the company asking them about this and even they admitted that the listing was deceptive. They sent me another gift package to correct the mistake.The fruit itself was good but really aren't anything to brag about. It's just good fruit. I don't ussually get any better quality fruit at the store, but for the price of this package I can certainly over look that fact."
1,Underwhelmed...Oprah was wrong this time,"The Fruit Company has sold me a bill of goods and then let me down. While trying to decide what year-long fruit of the month club to send my parents, their customer service reps will promise anything, but don't live up to the what they say. The organic fruit has been costly and disappointing. I asked about substitutions (parents on Lipitor and cannot have grapefruit) for meds or personal preferences and I'm told, ""No problem"". But after I've charged the yearly gift to my VISA and paid, the Fruit Company continues to give my parents either the wrong monthly delivery or give them a hard time about switching. The watercolor boxes are not something you would want to save and re-use. They're cardboard with so-so graphics. Nothing special here. I should have gone with Harry and David."
2,son muy pequeños,la calidad de este modelo no me gusto primeros bolle que uso y se descolora y pela la montura si no fuera por los cristales diria que es una imitacion
1,"Wow, disappointing for a Tami Hoag book!","I've been a Tami Hoag fan for years now so when I found this book from her earlier days as a romance writer, I thought I would give it a try. I should have left it on the shelf! Boring, lame, unexciting, short cut scenes and set in the 80's where spiked hair and Hawaiian shirts were as popular as Tom Selleck (who was mentioned at least twice). Just not a good read for me. But on the upside, it did have some cute and sweet moments, however I'll stick with her later thriller/suspense novel works."
3,"Entertaining, but predictable","I love Tami Hoag books. Have purchased them for years. This one wasn't her best. I was on vacation, so finished it quickly. Didn't hold my attention like her other ones have, but still love her work."
1,"Argh...My first and last ""romance novel""","I've read some of Tami Hoag's mysteries and enjoyed them as good summer fun reading. I thought this would be interesting since it was a bit different than the other books she'd written. I believe this was the first. Oh lordy--it was just a romance novel and so different than her other books. She writes a fairly meaty mystery and mixes them with a bit of romance, but this book was pure, predictable...um, not so great stuff.If you're looking for a good study on how a writer can grow, read this and then one of her mysteries. If you are looking for another decent Tami Hoag book, try another mystery instead."
5,Simply Amazing!!!,"I was looking for Begum Akhtar's ""Koyelia Mat Kar pukar"" online & I found this album on Amazon. Initially I was bit sceptical because I really like this song on Begum Akhtar's voice only in her own style & never heard of this artist before. Then I just played the intro & belive me I immediately liked the song. Though it is sang bit differently but really liked the texture of Ms. Banerjee Bhawmik's voice, pronouciation of words & overall rendition. It is really really excellent. Just to clarify, I'm no authority of Hindustani Clasical or even understand too much of it but I love to listen to Hindustani Semiclassical music & I like what I like. I'm really interested in listening more from Ms. Banerjee Bhawmik. I've started building my collection & playlist of her songs on my iPOD!! Love this voice!!!"
4,Buy This,"I just happened to have MTV2 on and there video was on.I was blown away! They are great, the only stand out in the [music] that passes as PUNK muisc these days. I only gave this cd 4 stars because there are two songs i really did not care for but other then that BUY THIS CD. To bad MTV will not play there stuff as much as Good Charlotte,those guys rock (sic)."
5,A passage in time,"THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!!! The guitars are great, the songs are full of energy, and the lead singer's voice is awesome!"
5,Authority Zero-A Passage In Time,"Finally Authority Zero Came outh with there full cd! For those of you who don't know who they are, they are Arizona's Top Local Band but I don't think that there so local anymore. They are now on the Punk-O-Rama tour. And now back the the album. And yes it is a good album. They have remade all of the songs and there sound great! On the song ""Everyday"", they changed the lyrics of the first chorus and they left out the little bass part where the music stops. I was disapointed because that was a good part of the song i felt but hey! I didn't make the cd! If you are a large fan of punk rock or just any type of music ranged from there, i highly suggest that you purchase this album. Well thats all for now, please reply!"
5,A diamond in the rough,"These guys are a surprising highlight in the current sea of mediocrity that modern music currently resides at. Their energy abounds throughout almost the entire album. The ""punk gone island"" sound is very refreshing and upbeat. Despite my displeasure with the group for cancelling their tour with Everclear the day I was supposed to see them in concert, Authority Zero has a fun and quality sound that has piqued my interest for many months running now.I listen to Passage in Time, One More Minute, and Sky's the Limit again and again. There is a slight similarity in sound to Pennywise, but Authority Zero brings enough of their own element to the table that they don't seem like a sound-alike. I recommend picking this cd up over most of the emo bands that are currently getting major radio airtime without really needing any talent."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this producted and in short, its a waste of money. The decals are warped, sun bleached, and pealing away from the sticky backing. After i applied the sticker, i let them sit for more then 24 hours in hopes that perhaps with more time, the dried old glue might adhear correctly. This was not the case, and i was force to use spray mounting to get more then half the letters to stick correctly. Obviously these items are not stored correctly or even caired for in the least. Don't Waste your time or money buying this! Of all the decals i have applied to my car (6 in all) this is by far the worse i have ever used. I'm going to have to spend another 15.00 just to replace the 5 letters that have fallen off."
4,Kudos,"Jo Petty certainly has a real winner with ""Apples of Gold"". I am over fifty and can relate to many of the phrases quoted by the compiler. The book generated rather mixed reviews from my young granddaughter who seemed bewildered at some of the outdated metaphors. However, to most of us ""oldsters"", we are quickly able to grasp the wisdom behind the phrase."
4,TIMELESS,"WHENEVER I NEED A LITTLE PICK ME UP, I FIND MYSELF GOING BACK TOTHIS BOOK, AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE PHRASES SEEM TO ACQUIRE A NEW MEANING ASTIME PROGRESSES AND AS SPIRITUAL NEEDS CHANGE."
4,THOUGHT PROVOKING,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK YEARS AGO, READ IT AND FORGOT ABOUT IT. HOWEVER, YEARS LATER HAVING LOST TRACK OF ITS WHEREABOUTS, I FIND MYSELF REMEMBERING BITS AND PIECES OF THE GEMS HELD WITHIN. I'M PLACING AN ORDER FOR A 2ND COPY SO IN MY OLD AGE I AM NOT WITHOUT WHEN I NEED A LITTLE REMEMBERENCE."
5,Apples of Gold by Jo Petty,"This is to say ""Well Done"" to the seller, Colorado Mist Sanctuary...they were great!! Received notification of receipt of my order and next day shipment within 24 hrs of placing my order. The book is brand new although I purchased a ""used book"". All monies (minus Amazon's commission) go towards last chance help (feed, vet bills, etc) for wildlife and horses. They have no public funding and I was very pleased to not only receive a great book, but to help in the rescue of hurting animals at the same time. I highly recommend their organization for purchasing books. Amazing service, great reason to buy and enjoy a good book."
3,The mexican border,"It was alright. At first you might not catch on cause of all the spanish, but it will be well worth the read once you get further along in the book.It was kind of short. Page numbers had nothing to do with it, it was just that the story seemed kind of short. I gave this mexican 3 stars."
3,"Great Sound, So-so Performance","As another reviewer points out, this Shostakovich Symphony #8 does sound great. Unfortunately, the performance doesn't meet the same high standard. Andrew Litton's interpretation IS solid, but he consistently fails to build any real tension to lead up to the tremendous climaxes, and no sense of resolution follows. Perhaps more importantly, the musical motifs that hold this hour-long piece together are by no means obvious, and the listener may wonder just WHY the notes say this is one of the greatest symphonies of the 20th century, since it frequently seems to be meandering in this CD. But the playing, like the sound is clean, and if you don't mind a lack of genuine musical drama in a war symphony, you can use it to test out your system!"
2,Wrong version of one of their biggest hits!,"I cannot recommend this collection as it contains a weak, alternate version of one of their two biggest hits: Just A Little. There is good music within but there are better Beau Brummels compilations available such as: The Best of the Beau Brummels: Golden Archive Series."
1,Just a Little,"I bought this CD before reading the other reviews. I love ""Laugh Laugh"" and ""Just a Little,"" and was extremely disappointed with this CD, when I discovered the song ""Just a Little"" was not the ""HIT"" version. I would not have bought this CD if I knew that ahead of time."
4,Great bath time fun for the kids!,"What a nifty little bunch of toys. They have all sorts of unique designs and with a little bit of water, the kids can cling them to the shower walls. Otherwise, they float in the tub. They dry fairly easily too. It also comes with two shower poofs which kids like too. My son's favorite are the balls! Ball! Ball! Ball!FYI: I read a previous review that said the balls smelled of PVC, but I don't think they are. I think they're some other material (not a material identification by smell expert) like rubber."
4,Great item,"Love the foam toys. My 20 month old son loves how they stick to the walls (once wet) and I love how they don't make any mess. The shapes and colors are great to look at and great for pretending. The scrubbies and the balls are superfluous, however."
2,Great product but not completely safe,"The product is bright, colorful, and fun for little boys and girls. However, the balls in the set are made of PVC. They smell unbelievably horrible. And the smell transferred to other items. I had to wash everything thoroughly with soap and throw away the balls. The smell made me sick. Without the balls, it made a great product. The shapes and scrubbies are BpA-free, PVC- free, phthalate-free."
1,"Chemical smell too strong, couldn't use with 14m baby","I received this item in March 2011. As soon as I opened the package I could smell a very strong chemical-like smell that seemed to have permeated all of the contents. The smell reminded me a bit of a varnish-y type of smell, and was so strong that I could not imagine being able to wash it off. I returned this item as the scent was so strong that I was not comfortable giving it to my 14 month old to use in the bath. The designer applique aspect of these toys only warrants it getting a rating of the (required) one star in my opinion, as the smell makes them unusable."
2,Mold on the toys!,"I'm so disappointed because I purposefully bought these toys as they claim to be mold free. Well, six months after buying them, they have little black spots ALL over them and they don't come off. Otherwise, loads of fun. So sad."
3,Pricey For Foam Bath Toys,"They are just OKAY. I thought they were a little pricey for bath foam toys. My son seems to like them now, but I can see him loosing interest soon."
2,Foam pieces emit awful chemical smell,"We have a number of plastic boon bath toys and really like them. They are stylish and fun and more importantly are all BPA, pthalate, and PVC free.However, these foam shapes emitted such an awful chemical smell when I opened the package, that I could not convince myself that they are truly non-toxic and safe for small kids to play with - especially in the bath tub where warm water may accelerate leaching out of chemicals.Perhaps the smell fades over time or can be washed out, but I wasnt interested in finding out.One other side note - The balls that come with this product are not made out of silicone as stated in the product description. They used to be made out of PVC but are now made out of EVA plastic (according to Boon customer service)."
2,Good Music. That's it!,"I didn't really like this movie because the matches were very short. Here are the matches: Mankind vs. Undertaker at King of the Ring 1998 in a steel cage match, Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon in a steel cage match at St. Valentines Day Massacre, and the winner will face the WWF Champion at WrestleMania 15, The Rock vs. Mankind in a last man standing match for the WWF Championship at St. Valentines Day Massacre, X-Pac vs. Shane McMahon with Test for the WWF European championship, and the Hardy Boyz vs. Edge and Christian in a ladder match to win one hundred thousand dollars from Terri at 1999's No Mercy. The music was the only good thing about this movie. ...."
4,I think it is good,Highlights of the matches below-Mankind vs Undertaker KOTR 1998 HIACAustin vs Vince St. Valintines day Massacre 1999 cage matchMankind vs Rock Last Man Standing match WWE Championship St. Valintines day MassacreE&C; vs Hardyz Tag Team Ladder Match for Terri Runnels Services No Mercy 1999For some reason people hate this video. I think it shows a good amount of clips. I reccomend it if you can find it.
2,Cool front cover - that's it!,"Great matches in my opinion are: Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker Hell in a Cell at Badd Blood, The Rock vs. HHH at Rebellion, Mick Foley vs. Taker Hell in a Cell at King of the Ring, Austin at WM14 and WM15, Andre the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan at WM3, Hogan vs. Warrior, Shawm Michaels vs. Razor Ramon Ladder match... and on and on and on! There are about 100 amazing matches that you must see, so tell me something, why does this tape last 40 minutes and contain 4 matches? A waste of time by the WWF and you the fan. Since when was X-Pac vs. Shane-o-Mac ever a classic?"
1,This video just Sucks!,I got the video because I liked about all the matches and they seemed to be good but I was wrong the matches are good but the HIGHLIGHTS of the matches were VERY SHORT and their was no crowed reaction they took the crowd reaction out and replaced it w/ boring awful sounding music! This video just sucks! Theirs not one good thing I can say about it DO NOT get the video! I got the stupid video and that same week I took it back and got my money back its not worth it leave it on the shelf and get Wrestlemania 17 or Summerslam 2000 instead. WWF Eve of Destruction Sucks the worst WWF Video ever to come out!!!
2,Good Music. That's it!,"I didn't really like this movie because the matches were very short. Here are the matches: Mankind vs. Undertaker at King of the Ring 1998 in a steel cage match, Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Vince McMahon in a steel cage match at St. Valentines Day Massacre, and the winner will face the WWF Champion at WrestleMania 15, The Rock vs. Mankind in a last man standing match for the WWF Championship at St. Valentines Day Massacre, X-Pac vs. Shane McMahon with Test for the WWF European championship, and the Hardy Boyz vs. Edge and Christian in a ladder match to win one hundred thousand dollars from Terri at 1999's No Mercy. The music was the only good thing about this movie. I only liked the music. My friend, Patrick Grasso only liked the music.By: Michael Sweeney"
1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,"If the contents of the tape were half as good as the name it might have been decent. Each match is cut somewhat and the interviews are lackluster and stale. Also these matches are advertised as the best of the year but aren't. Many great matches from '99 aren't on this tape. Ignore this tape at any costs. Just buy a '99 PPV.(ex/Wrestlemania XV, Backlash, Summer Slam)"
2,Flawed,"Yes this lamp is pretty, but it is also flawed in that one of the bulbs is way below the shade, so it shines in your eyes -- while the other is so high that it burns the shade. I did not return it as it's such a hassle, but I would very much like a replacement lamp."
5,Get This Book!,"A fantastic resource. This is one of the best Japanese cookbooks available in English. While most Japanese cookbooks overlap with other ones, this one has information not found in other books. This has one of the best sections explaining basic techniques and tools in Japanese cooking. Additionally there is a glossary of Japanese ingredients and lists of acceptable substitutions for Komatsu-na and other tough to find vegetables. For all this information alone it would be a must buy. While familiar recipes such as teriyaki and ohitashi are covered, there are also a number of recipes not commonly found in Western-published cookbooks. The IS an essential cookbook as the the title claims."
2,snap crackle and pop,"I downloaded ""It's Cold Outside"" by The Choir and discovered it had been dubbed from vinyl. Since it isn't the best recording to begin with, that's unacceptable."
3,You get what you pay for,"I like this belly ring, but the ""aurora"" effect scratched off in the first week with basic cleaning. It's now a plain, dark blue belly ring. It's still nice, but I was a little disappointed that the irridescent effect was about the same as painting one coat of fingernail polish on it."
2,Review For This Is Smooth Jazz: Love Bossa Style,"The Cd that I received was in great condition. The CD itself let me down a bit because I was expecting so much more I guess because of the name. With other CD's I get more than just the one track that I like, this one not so much."
4,Fun,This product isn't perfect for it's fun for the kids and that is what really matters. Some times it slides forward a bit but that's not really a big deal to me. I think for the money it's a fun thing for the kiddos.
1,Doesn't fit on my faucet!,"I love the idea of this product, and would use it all the time, but I have a wider faucet and it doesn't fit! What a disappointment! I destroyed the packaging while opening it, so I wasn't able to return it. If it had fit (and I don't have an overly large faucet), I would have given it 5 stars because it would be great in helping fill my baby tub in the bathtub."
2,Worked Okay,"Worked okay, but my one yr old thought it was a new bath toy and could pull it off with no problem. Kind of defeated the purpose of buying it."
4,Good (so far),I know a lot of people complained about mold. We haven't had this product that long so that hasn't been an issue for us. I also just try to wipe it down after the bath stops running. Overall I really like this product. It's easy to attach to the faucet and my daughter loves playing the in the water that it sprays out. It also protects her head from bumping the faucet which is what I originally bought it for.
3,We don't have a shower pull - the faucet cover is very easy to pull off,"Since we don't have a shower pull on our faucet, it's very easy for our daughter to pull the cover off the faucet. Not sure I would buy this again."
2,I had high hopes,This looked like such a great idea. I knew there were issues with it fitting some faucets but hoped we wouldn't have the problem.It worked great for the first couple of baths...then I guess it loosened up a bit and started sliding off. It got to the point where I couldn't keep it on the faucet for anything.I hope the company considers a newer version that fits more faucets. I would gladly buy it again - it was really great while it lasted!
2,It did not flo as advertised,"This did not fit well at all over our standard faucet. The wetter it got, the more it slid all over after much adjustment in the first place. Water spewed out from the top and back as well.I can believe this item works well for some, but it did not work with our bathtub faucet."
2,doesn't fit my faucet,"I love the idea of this product. And my son does love the waterfall affect. However, it doesn't fit my faucet, which is just a standard faucet AND the soap dispenser DOES NOT stop leaking. I'm still glad I bought it though, simply because it entertains my son. But, I really think that it needs to be remade to prevent soap leaks."
4,BIG HIT WITH 2 TODDLERS!....little leaky,"I let my 4 y.o. son give this to his sister for her 2 y.o birthday. They both love it. Turned them into little water bugs. My daughter loves to have the water run back over her head, and it has made washing hair much easier at our house. Both kids have learned to put their faces into water too. Something a few swim instructors have been struggling to get them to do. My only complaint is that the compartment for storing the bubble solution leaks. This is easily avoiding by only putting in the amount you want used during 1 bath at the beginning of that bath. My kids take it on and off the faucet themselves. It seems pretty durable."
4,Like the safety factor,My 19 mo old daughter loved to sit up the water spout and collect water in her cups. This keeps her a nice safe distance back and she can still have fun. I bought it hoping that I could rinse her hair but she won't lean back under the waterfall. I still like the product though. It doesn't fit my spout exactly but it still works well.
1,do you like to waste your money if so this is the prefect product for you,"this spout protector was the best one i had ever seen. it fanned out the water so the pressure comeing from the spout was so strong. it had a bubble bath depenser and it had a place to pull up the shower stick with having to mess with it . so just by looks and features i was sold. i got it delivered and i was so excited for it i pretty much instantly put my child in the bath. fast foward a month later this peice of crap breaks. the bottom falls off. and theres no fixing it.its nothing more than a peice of rubber held on by two flimsy plastic dowels. the design has signifaclly fail and of course like most warrenties it the product craps out after words so ive thrown my money in the trash dont buy this is suck.Boon Inc. Flo Water Deflector, Faucet Cover With Bubble Bath Dispenser Kiwi"
1,"Design flaw, explained","Like others, I like Boon products and this one looked great. However, it does not work on my bath's faucet/spout -- it falls off easily and often, from my baby touching it, from the water flow, sometimes all by itself when noone's near it. The problem seems to be two-fold:1) Our bath spout does not have the pull-knob on it to switch between bath/shower mode. Ours is built into the wall. This knob may hold the Boon Flo on better (it is pictured in the product photos).2) The hinge-spring doesn't seem tight enough -- it seems to loosen after a couple of weeks.I wish Boon had specified that it doesn't work for certain types of bath faucets. Leaves me wary of the company's other products (even though I've bought some other ones which work fine). I may try silicon tape, as someone here suggested, but I shouldn't have to . . ."
3,"Looks great, but breeds mildew","There are many nice things about this product but I would not recommend it if:- you do not have a drain lever on your faucet, it just slides off- your bathroom is even remotely susceptible to mildew. Ours is, and the rubber inside Flo seemed to breed it instantly like nothing else. This wouldn't be an enormous problem - except Flo did not clean at all, even with Tilex and taking it apart to go at all its nooks with a toothbrush. Soaking it on the window ledge in near 100% bleach for 6 hours seems to be the only thing that worked. Sort of strange for a product designed to be used in a wet environment."
3,"Would be GREAT, if it fit my faucet...","The tub faucet at my house has the ""shower pull"" near the back of the faucet (delta brand) so this does NOT fit well on it. However, I am using it anyway as it will clamp loosely on the faucet but is EASILY pulled off. The pros are - my daughter loves to play in the water as it comes out of the faucet and it keeps her from bumping her head on the metal faucet(and then falls off again). I have yet to use the bubble bath dispenser."
1,Don't buy,"Falls off the faucet, does not stay on, kids can take/ pull off way to easily. Not a good purchase! There are cheaper ones that are far better!"
2,Mildew stains won't come off,"I really wanted to like this product and thought it was really cute; however water tends to pool in the water deflector which creates mildew. In addition, the mildew stains won't clean off at all. I have even tried applying bleach products, and the material remains stained from the mildew. There is a small hole in the water deflector to allow for water to drain; however I have found that this hold gets plugged and requires a toothpick to clean it. The water deflector does deflect water to some degree, but it certainly does not create a ""waterfall"" as shown in the pictures. If the waterfall worked properly, it would be a lot more fun. The bubble dispenser seemed like a nice idea; however we ended up liking a bubble bath that requires the product to be shaken before dispensing, so the bubble dispenser didn't meet our needs."
2,"Neat looking, not effective.","This looks neat, but is easily pulled off by baby. Like, within 15 seconds of putting him in the tub. Put it back on, he pulls it off again. It's a game! A game that makes tub time more dangerous since he's standing to pull the thing off every time it's put back on. Maybe if my kid was six years old it would be useful for rinsing shampoo, but in that case I wouldn't need a flow deflector to accomplish that anyway."
3,Bubble dispenser needs a little more work,It looks great but when I pour the soap in the dispenser it doesn't hold it in there. Don't fill it up because it will just waste soap.
5,Love it!,"I love the fact that it has a little hole at the bottom where the water comes out so that water doesn't just pool at the bottom. I love the bubble bath dispenser as well. It does take a little bit of adjusting getting on the faucet, but I LOVE this! So does my 11-month old baby."
4,good not great,"i like this thing - it doesnt fit my faucet perfectly but it does stay on and provide a little waterfall and shoot the water further away from the edge of the tub for the kids. I havent tried the bubble bath dispenser - in fact I didnt even realize that feature until I just saw the product name again. anyway, even if it entertains the kids during bathtime for a few weeks, its worth it."
3,its cute BUT,so i have a 16 month daughter who bought this for since she really enjoys the bath and loves to stick her head near the faucet. i saw this product on ebay and similar sites but for way more. decided i would go ahead and buy it. its really cute but dosent stay on my faucet very well. we have a fairly new home and the faucets do not look that old so when the water comes out and pushes down on the product it soon falls off. it was a bit of a disappointment but i still just put it back on if it falls off. plus my 16 month old loves to play with it so it really does not serve a purpose in my house except for decoration and being cute. hope this helps!
2,I don't know if I would bother,Cute product. Has a nice splash with my 9m old likes to use as a waterfall. The bubbles are fun... but my 2 year old takes it off easily and the inside gets really moldy and is tiresome to clean so its kind of gross.
3,Is your shower pull knob far back on the spout?,"if your shower pull knob is far back on the spout, closer to the wall, this one won't work for you. The opening where the knob goes was not long enough so my shower pull knob doesnt fit in the allotted slot, and the whole thing just falls right into the water. :("
4,Modern,"I bought this product because I loved the look of it and needed a faucet cover since we are having a baby in just a few days. I thought the ducky and frog covers were bit tacky. As soon as I got home with this, I opened it up and stuck in on the faucet and filled it with bubbles. I love the waterfall and took a bath that night. I was having issues with the bubble dispense when I first put in super thick bubble bath. I then mixed the thick bubble bath with runnier bubble and it worked great. I do wish the bubble dispense worked a bit better as I am not 100% satisfied with it but still love it. It also does not slip off our faucet like some reviewers have complained about."
2,"Good concept, lousy product","This is mainly a safety item, right? So it's a problem that my nine-month-old can pull it off easily. Like other reviewers, I have the most standard faucet around, and the Flo fits loosely, at best. Also, while the spout part is a nice pliable plastic, the upper section which covers the faucet is made of hard plastic which would give quite a painful bonk. We would have been better off with an ordinary old rubber ducky faucet cover."
4,"Not perfect, but we're happy","As other reviewers have mentioned, we have to adjust the angle and position of the Boon Flo to keep the water from going off the back and onto the edge of the tub... and onto the floor if we're not quick enough. The bubble bath dispenser is pretty worthless - it leaks all the bubble bath out in between bath times and leaves a nice half-dried soapy puddle on the bottom of the tub.BUT - It does what it's designed to do: Protects baby from hitting her head on the spout, and the waterfall effect is fun. The design is attractivly modern and not too ""cutesy."""
2,Boon Flo,"Make sure you have the correct faucet....I haven't had a chance to use it yet, because it doesn't work on my faucet...."
2,Only will fit the smallest tub spouts,"I really liked the design of this faucet cover and thought the bubble bath dispenser and the sheet of water would be so cool and fun for our son unfortunately the design is made only for the smallest of tubspouts. Also, beware if your spout has a lip that comes down at the end. This device will NOT fit over the lip. I was able to return the item."
2,Check your faucet first!,"I bought this knowing there is a chance I would return it and sure enough I did. It is a very cute idea and if we move/get a different faucet, I will likely try it again, but it only works if the faucet on your tub has the plug at the front of the faucet, otherwise it slides off and the water goes to the side. Just fair warning!"
2,wouldnt recamend,this item doesnt fit right and slides off eaily and gets molded vary easy but other then that its vary cute and i got alot of complement on it
2,faucet cover,"I had soft plastic one and inflate one before. this looked good but didn't work with our faucet cause it slips off all the time since the drain hook deal is not there to keep it hold on. if it works, product looks good though."
2,Completely covers our water deflector,"I suspect I might have loved this item, if I could have used it. But, unfortunately, I had to return it as it completely perfectly covered our water deflector, which it was supposedly designed not to do. On our spigot, the upper/rear end of the Flo sat right on top of our deflector no matter what we did to try to adjust it. Oh well."
3,Looks good,"The deflector has cool design but it doesn't really fit well with the faucet. It sits more leveled than the picture shown, which allows water accumulates at the tongue and mold over time..."
4,great product!,"i love this! i have a cat that will not stay out of the tub because he loves to play with the faucet and this drives me nuts! this cover deters him from the tub and faucet! i love it! my daughter loves it so much too! she loves the waterfall effect it has. I have a larger faucet so it was awkward at first and the water was leaking out of the back of it, but after moving it around a bit and got a better grip/seal on the faucet with it, it works just fine now! easy clean up too. just soak in in bleach a little but when i clean up her other bath toys and it's good as new. I don't have issues with nasty mildew with mine as other's have reported in their reviews. i never have to remove it unless i'm cleaning it. it's great and never in the way and looks great in my bathroom."
3,"Works okay, grows mildew, comes off too easily","This worked good at first, but now it seems it doesn't grip as tight, and it slips off when my son merely touches it (and we have a shower lever on it). The way it is designed, the bottom of it collects water, and mold grows in it. Since my son likes to put his mouth on it, I have to clean it constantly. It looks great on, and it works okay, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,great product - but not meant for modern faucets,"we thought the concept and design was wonderful EXCEpt it did not fit over our tub faucet (kohler purist). so, needless to say, we were not able to use it."
2,Would not buy again,I bought this because my granddaughter fell and scraped her face on the faucet in the bath tub and by appearance it looked like it would cover the majority of the faucett and keep her from getting hurt again. The problem is that we have excellant water pressure and when the water is on it shoots off the faucett - when the water is off it slides down to the end and barely hangs on. It has fit the purpose but I would like it better if it stayed in place.Grami
2,"fits, but beware!","Ok, so it fits over our weird lift up shower valve and it protects the kids from the sharp edge of the faucet, but it grows mold an is pretty gross. I soaked it in bleach ad it smells better but it didn't really get the stains off. Also, the soap drips out if you leave it in. Wastes the bubble bath and makes for a slippery surprise in the morning when you step into the bath tub. I haven't seen any other product that fits over our faucet, so I'm keeping it for now, but i don't love it."
3,Nice idea - but poor function,This would not fit properly on my faucet and seemed like it would've fallen off with water pressure even if it had fit. The upside was that when I called BOON customer service they were nice as can be and were very accomodating and agreed to replace it with any other Boon product I would like (within close value).
2,Boon Flo's but doesn't fit,"This product is great in theory but in reality, it leaves a little something to be desired. It wouldn't stay on our standard size tub spout unless I held it on. It started sliding off as soon as I let go. A slippery one year old and one less free hand are not a good combo."
3,It Okay.,"It does stay on my tap while the water comes out. After, it will eventually fall off during the course of my children's bath. I was hoping it would serve as a fun toy but then be functional as a faucet cover to avoid bumped heads. Not so much, nope.I love this company and had higher hopes thinking surely that our faucet is commonly found (a cheap builder's favorite!) in homes and maybe all these other reviews were from people with fancier Moen and other hoity brands. Sadly, no."
3,Doesn't fit all faucets,I think this would be a great product had it fit out bathtub faucet. Our lever that turns the shower on is too far back on the faucet for this faucet cover to fit. Been careful before you purchase this product and make sure your faucet looks like the one pictured.
4,Great for children that don't like water in their face.,Great product. Easy to install. Easy to use. Just didnt realize it only fits on standard size faucet head. I have a garden tub and it has a larger faucet head which doesnt fit. Water shoot out the back past the gasket but works great in her tub.
4,good,"This faucet protector takes no time to install, and the rubber tip protects adequately. I like the bubble bath feature as well, however the water tends to back up a little, and the bubblebath cap gets in the way of the shower pull knob. Other than that, it works just fine."
4,Love it but not for all faucets,"I love this as much as my son - only way he would let me rinse off his hair - but it does not fit on all faucets. When we moved, we found out that it does not fit our new bathroom faucet well. It will slide on but my son can easily yank it off (he's 17 months).On the plus side, my husband LOVES the bubble bath dispenser feature. Makes bath time set-up for him a cinch!"
5,Awesome!!!,I don't know what all the bad reviews are about!!! It fits on my faucet just fine and I don't have one like the one in the picture. I love it!!! I love how the water flows it's soo cool and I love the fact it has a bubble bath soap dispenser!!! Plus I love the color!!! This is a must have!!!
3,It's okay,I have this spout cover but it does not fit my tup spout very well. We rigged it up with tape and rubber bands to hold it in place. My kids love to dispense the bubbles! IT is gentle enough for my baby to play with the water and washing hair is a snap! Just wish it would fit better.
5,Work GREAT!,I love this product. It works great on our Kohler faucet. Really helps when washing hair and such.
1,Does not work,"This product is pretty disappointing. It does not clamp tightly to the faucet spout and slips off to the end causing water to flow out the back. My spout is a typical design so the cover should be able fit properly. Many people mentioned the need for a shower pop-up knob, which we do have. When someone takes a shower, the cover slips forward holding the knob up. The knob would normally pop back down when the shower is turned off. Instead I get an icy cold shower when I turn my daughter's bath water on! The other problem is that the resevoir to hold bubble bath leaks badly and when I filled it in the evening at bath time it had completely drained by morning. This happened the very first time we used it, not after soap gunk had built up in the dispenser. The only feature I did like was that it was effective at diffusing the water flow which made it quieter and less scary to my baby."
4,Good product,"The Boon Water Deflector is designed to fit most faucets. It fits relatively well, although it slides down when our little guy pulls on it. It stays on and protects him from denting his head. He loves the waterfall and tries to drink from it. Overall, it fits our needs and is a good product."
2,Doesn't fit all faucets,"It is a great concept, but didn't fit my system. I just sent it back. But I would recommend it to anyone with an older, smaller tub faucet."
2,It's okay.,"I don't really LOVE it, nor do I really dislike it? The bubble bath spout feature? Not the greatest. Great idea, poor execution. I am adding a picture to the main picture gallery. I literally just poured a lot of expensive baby bath into it, and it drained before 4 hours had even gone by! Yes, down the drain! So I cannot use that feature with this item. It's not very SOFT. Not the top of it, only the bottom. So I am not sure how this is really that much safer for the baby than just the regular spout alone. But I like how pretty it is. This is my first night owning it, so I may come back and say more, but for now- I'm undecided whether or not I will continue to use."
1,Attractive Danger,"I purchased this product because my 10 month old loves to pull himself up on the tub spout during bath time. I purchased it to protect his noggin in the eventual spill he will take during this activity. Well, I have the exact tub spout that is pictured on the box and the cover slips right off...no problem for a 10 month old nor an adult to remove. He grabbed it the first time, it slipped off and he fell on his bum, spot cover in hand. He was also more interested in the spout when it had the cover on. The added color and newness of the cover and the fact that it high lit the shower diverter made it an instant attractive and dangerous item for my son."
2,Not soft material,"I bought this thinking it would protect my child from knocking their head off of a hard faucet, but for this purpose this item is useless. It is just as hard as the faucet. The only soft piece on this ""faucet protector"" is the water deflector. What a waste of money!"
2,Poor fit and impossible to clean,"We don't have a shower diverter pull on our faucet, so this faucet cover often falls off. Additionally, it has so many crevices that just turns orange with mold and is impossible to clean. It pretty much has to be soaked and then cleaned with a Qtip and there are still parts that don't get cleaned. Love other Boon products, but I'd pass on this one. Actually in the market for a new faucet cover."
1,Had to return it,"If you don't have a typical faucet, it won't fit. Mine is decorative and it didn't fit. Great idea but just not for us unfortunately."
4,Good Hair rinse,This is a great item to rinse hair for little kids. Your tub needs to have good water pressure for the flow to look like the picture.
2,good idea in theory.,"Okay, first, this thing looks a million times cooler than those duck ones. I was really excited about a functional item that looked cool too, but I was disappointed. I expected the design to be more evolved- there are a few major flaws. My 10 month old son can (and does) easily pull this off the faucet. When he does that, the door to the bubble dispenser pops open and all of the soap comes out. Additionally, the bubble dispenser door pops off easily (choking hazard?) I wouldn't buy a duck, but I am pretty disappointed with this product."
1,Doesn't last,"This product does collect mold and rust as other reviews state. Also, the bubble bath dispenser is an unnecessary feature since it doesn't release a lot of soap at a time and for the time spent in refilling the dispenser, it would be just as easy to add the bubble bath directly to the bath. Not worth the money."
5,Excellent Idea Boon,I love this thing and the fact that it goes on and off the bathtub faucet is excellent. At first I left it on all the time but then I decided it's easier to just take it on and off when I give our son a bath. I bought this along with the inflatable bath tub liner and it's a really great invention. Great Job Boon!!
1,pass on this product,"The problem with this water deflecto is that it does not stay on the spout. It keeps sliding down and i have to constantly adjust it, and I don't have anything fancy or unique... just a standard bathtub and faucet. The soap filler does not like any heavier consistency soap. My 5yr olds Johnson & Johnson regular bubble bath soap is too thick and it doesn't get released no matter how much we press the button. Had I not destroyed and threw away the box, I would have returned it."
1,LESS THAN ONE STAR IF POSSIBLE,"This is HORRIBLE. It does NOT stay on my faucet, if I hold it there, the water comes out in one flow, I can't really adjust the location of it. And the bubble bath holder/opening doesn't actually get any bubble bath into the water. This is a HUGE waste of money. So disappointed. Oh, and fair warning, the box is a complete mess to open so I practically destroyed it trying to get the stupid thing out. So I can't return it now! Extremely angry about this product."
3,It got mold on it :(,It served its purpose wonderfully. It kept my daughter from hitting her head on the faucet. It came in handy when I wanted to wash my hair in the tub really quickly. I never tried putting bubble bath in it. But unfortunately I started to see black mold on it. The mold cleaners say not to use them on soft plastic so I couldn't get rid of it. So if you have any issues with mold in your bath tub this might not be the one for you. What I might have done differently is remove it from the tub when not in use. That may have helped prevent/slow the mold growth.
2,Gross!!,I had read a million reviews before purchasing this item and my main big complaint is mildew! I clean this thing on a weekly basis and took it off to discover so much that will not come off with any type of cleaner. I knew all about the fit and knew it would be a bit wobbly but it still worked. I refuse to have my son anywhere near this because of the fact that like others state it breeds mildew. If you think maybe yours will be exempt I doubt it unless you soak it in bleach every night which is ridiculous.
2,Works well but breeds MILDEW!,"I loved this product in the beginning. I bought it because I loved the water fall feature. I left it on the spout for months and months. It just never occurred to me to remove it. But I happened to be cleaning something on the floor near the edge of the tub one day and I looked up and saw mildew in the Flo! I was horrified. I took the thing off and threw it away. You'd think that a product that was meant for wet environments would be mildew resistant, you know, like shower curtains."
3,may be a little overrated,"The design for the product is neat and it serves the purpose in my children's tub, but I was not completely satisfied. After a month the whole base started slipping off the spout and won't stay up and the bubble dispenser takes forever to release enough liquid to even make the bubbles. My daughters still love the spout and how it pours and for the price it was still a good purchase."
3,"Good idea, but not perfect",It doesn't fill well on our standard faucet and the water isn't very well directed out the front. It covers the head of the faucet though that kids could hit their heads on and does help fill a baby tub that may not fit perfectly under the stream of your faucet.
3,Doesn't stay put!,It just pulls right off! there's nothing there to latch or lock to keep children from pulling it off! Other than that its perfect! I'd love it if it would just stay put! After all the purpose is to keep children from hurting themselves on the spout!
4,"Great product, not for everyone","This worked great at my mom's house, but my faucet is apparently wider at the base. When I first put the Flo on our faucet, water would spray from the back and front. I adjusted the Flo, and that problem seems to be fixed. The bubble bath dispenser is pretty nifty. I haven't noticed any leaking, but I only put in enough bubble bath solution for one bath. My son loves dispensing his own solution, but he hasn't learned when to stop pushing the button- LOL. It's a great product, but it's not for everyone. It just depends on what type of bath faucet you have."
4,Fun spout cover!,"I bought this a year ago and my kids both love it. It makes a really fun waterfall when the water is running and protects them from hitting their head or body on the hard faucet. It did dispense the bubble bath but in-between baths it dripped bubble solution into the tub. I kept filling it up at first but eventually didn't bother. It's easier to just pour some in out of the bottle. The bubble dispenser doesn't seal very well. Mine has just started getting mildew on it, which doesn't come off. But like bathmats and bath toys they all do eventually. I'm looking to buy another one just because my kids enjoy playing in the waterfall so much that I don't care about the bubble dispenser not really working the way it should. It does a good job of staying secure & in place. The inflatable ones pop and the rubber ones I have had slide around but this one clips on tight. I would recommend this to other parents and will buy another one for us too."
2,leaks soap,"I was not impressed with this item. While it did prevent my two year old from bumping his head on the hard faucet and made for extra frothy bubble baths, I found that it leaked the bubble bath soap I put in it. One brand of bubble bath I use is thicker and it clogged. Perhaps my tub faucet is larger than standard but I had a hard time opening the Flo wide enough to slip it on easily. It ended up at funny angle that allowed water to pool in the end. The water spray freaked out my son at first, even on low waterflow. He got used to it after a few days but never really took to it and refused to wash his hair under it. Eventually he asked me to take it off the faucet. I will try it again when he's older, I suppose. Knowing what I know now I would not spend my money on it."
1,Let it go...,Boons Let it Flo seemed like an awesome idea...the idea - awesome but the product not so much. I tried it on my faucet without a shower stopper and it fell off several times but because it was already out of the box I opted to try it out for the bathtime...when being held in position (by me) the water flowed nicely off it to give a good waterfall to shower off my toddlers soapy head. And it made the water come into the tub nicely as well...but the jist is:- it doesn't fit my tub (narrow faucet w/o shower stopper)- the item is made of hard plastic not a softer plastic that would be nice for the little kids heads!- from using it three times I could tell it was going to breed some awful mildew & soap residue that was going to be a pain to clean- and while the bubble bath dispenser is a cool idea...it'd be better if you didn't have to continuously push the button to get the soap out...Sorry Boon - I'm usually a big fan - but not today!
1,Disappointed,"While the information was valuable, the disk would only play on my computer, and even then there was a delay between the sound of speaking and the movement of lips. The quality was horrible. In addition, there was no menu from which to select topics. It was not of a high enough quality to be able to use in a business communication classroom as I had hoped, and it was so annoying to watch someone speak and then wait to hear what they said that I couldn't stand watching it myself. ""Better Communication"" needs better videographers."
4,Obsolete,"Bought this when it was $40, four years ago. Worked fine, but obsolete now that I found two 4-gig cards for $15 each."
1,MOZART DEBACLE?,"As a forum for musical discussion, I think all points of view relevant, whether I agree with them or not. It so happens that I have heard the Shanghai ensemble play in recital and on CD, and I must admit that these Mozart performances do not do them justice. Consequently, I think that Mr. Sobel has a valid argument. What I cannot accept in intelligent discourse is the belittling and rudeness of reviewers, such as Mr. Schneider, who feel their assessment of favorite music, composers or artists has been assailed. This kind of approach simply does not fly."
5,"Easy to Read, Easy to Understand, Easy to Follow","Carol Lea Benjamin's dog books are for the average person who wants a well behaved house pet. Nothing fancy, just straight and to the point. Her training methods are easy to apply and neither the dog or it's master are confused about the expected outcomes. I liked it enough, that I am buying another book by the same author. BT"
3,No biscuit,"Although the book is well-written and entertaining to read I really didn't find that it taught me anything new. It *was* helpful in reminding me some of the fundamentals about dog training, and really kicked me in the [head] to *constantly* positively reinforce, no matter how unimpressive a command the dog is following, but overall, I don't think any major revelations were achieved. Some interesting thoughts, and probably worth the money if you're a brand new dog owner with no prior experience with them, but I doubt someone with past dog experience would get as much out of it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER,DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. BOUGHT IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND IT DOES NOT WORK ALREADY. IT WILL NOT PLAY ANY CDS. ONLY OFFERS A 90 WARRANTY SO BASICALLY I AM OUT 30.00.
1,Doesn't Play CDs ~ Defective,"This product was not even worth the $29 we paid for it. It didn't play CD's easily from when we first opened the box. Then, CD's would skip and stop playing sporadically. Shortly after that, it stopped playing at all!!!!!!!!!!! BUYER BEWARE ~ don't even waste a penny on this."
4,Where Hip Hop Should Be,"It's too bad there aren't more groups like the Mountain Brothers. I feel they are where hip hop should be, but unfortunately isn't. Chops can lay down some phat tracks, and Styles is by far the most talented lyricist in the group. The album is a small step down from Self, Vol 1 (a classic) and has some excess fluff that you'll fast forward thru, but it's still definitely worth checking out."
2,A bit out of style,"I bought Self 1. but the MB's and loved it. Being that the album was still a little raw, I expected a more polished second CD (triple crown). Instead, this album sounds a but amateurish almost like it was recorded before self. 1. I don't know if they were trying to go in reverse or what. Another serious flaw, NOT ENOUGH CHOPS. Chops' baritone makes the MB's. Quite evident on songs like ""yes-yes"". I love this song and it rocks just as good as any 50 Cent or Eminem song. I only wish the rest of the CD was up to par with it. Not to mention, the sound is a little dated. Back pack hip-hop is dead. If you don't believe me, check the sales of the latest CD's by artists like the Roots, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Slum Village and Dweli."
4,A very strange and hellish book.,"The book was not as good as I thought it was going to be. When I read certain passages of it at the bookstore I thought it was going to be a fictional narrative of a doomed person's experience in Hell. Instead it was more of an artists explanation about his paintings. The book still drew me in and made me think and feel about what Hell might be like. For this reason, the books ability to make me seriously think about Hell in a literal sense, I will give it four stars."
5,Good God!,"All I'll say is this: Barlowe's Inferno literally kept me from falling asleep and consequently gave me nightmares. If this appeals to you, then stick this bad boy in your shopping cart. You will be disturbed and awed."
5,Oh... HELL!,"Very highly recommended... but be certain all your lights are on when you open this beautiful but disturbing book.Although Barlowe's searing INFERNO imagery is rendered in a somewhat less photographic, more ""painterly"" style than his earlier books I have, it's dead-on target for depicting this eternally skin-crawling, hyper-grotesque netherworld. Helpfully described by a sort of narrative text, the twisted inhabitants of Barlowe's raging nightmarescapes purposefully go about their unending torments with skull-shredding focus: their horrors make bizarre sense.I first went through this visually and spiritually cacophonous, masterful work on Christmas day. What contrast: listening to carols about angels from Heaven, while staring at demon-shrieking souls in Hell.Final note; don't miss the deliciously caustic JUSTITIA OMNIBUS at the bottom of page 2."
5,Disturbing,"Having read Dante's Inferno, a visual description is hard to render. Mr. Barlowe has done just that. He has painted the hard to desribe. One look through this book and you will be ""disturbed."" Mr. Barlowe has taken the ideas of different religions and beliefs in rendering his ""Inferno."" Having caught a ""glimpse"" of what awaits those that do wrong in the afterlife, one sees the visual deterent to doing wrong. This book is a must see."
5,Very solid album,Dull moments on this album are hard to find. Energetic tracks with good variation. No need to skip tracks - very good from front to back. This is probably a good album for those of you who fancy a good screw now and then. Had it in my car for 3 days and the songs just get better. Saw these guys at Coachella and they are even better live. The end.
5,Based on sample pages... :),"I am 24 and I just got done reading the 24 sample pages offered. Even though I have not read the book in its entirety I love what he has to say and I can't wait to read the rest. I think it is incredible and totally inspiring to the political youth of America today, even in 2002. Mind you this is an opinion totally based on the first 20 pages, and I can say I agree with him 100%. This book gets your attention and makes you want to see what's on the next page."
4,The gender gap,"The talents and accomplishments of women are often neglected despite remarkable achievements. Britian's flowering under Elizabeth I owed much to that ruler's direct influence. The Hermitage exists only because of Catherine the Great's extraordinary taste and insight. Fanny Mendelsshon was as gifted as her brother Felix and Kathe Kollwitz's self portrait is a match for Courbet's, Durer's or even Rembrandt's. This book, intended for teenagers, attempts to remedy the historical neglect of women by presenting the lives and works of Maria Tallchief, Lousie Navelson, Marian Anderson, Nadia Boulanger, Mary Cassett, Margaret Burke-White, Beverly Sills and Julia Morgan, all of whom made major contributions to their eight different fields. While the writing is a bit dry and a more detailed expostion of their work would be useful, the book is a must, even for adults, interested in redressing the gender imbalance in history."
4,Innerspectra,"A good buy, a new and beautiful perspective of the Tarot. Would not recommend for beginners. There are no professional readers, we are all in a state of learning something new with every spread of the Tarot. Intriguing, I respect this deck and it reads true and accurate for me."
3,Unusual deck,"I personally did not enjoy seeing the images from behind. I much prefer to see the front of the Temperance angel, the Magician etc. I didn't find much was revealed to me from seeing the images from this perspective. The artwork is beautiful but I will not be using this deck for readings."
4,A better read than the first one,"I read the first book in this series and I thought it was pretty good, but I felt that there was something missing in it. After I read Private Demon, everything started coming together in the general plot. I have to admit that this book was better than the first one. I wasn't too sure about Thierry's character at first. There wasn't much said about him in the first book so I wasn't quite sure that I would like his character much, but he turned out to be just as exciting as the plot. Overall I will say this about the book it was very emotional with a healthy dose of good sex, and gut twisting action. I actually felt bad for one of the characters at the end of it. You just wanted to shed a tear for him. (Not gonna say who. So don't worry about spoilers.) I can't wait for to read the third book. (Lucan's an awesome character)"
4,not your typical romance,in response to other reviews complaints on the many story lines and different characters involved i can say that each story was one that you were draawn into and this time john kellers tale is actually one enjoyable to read and not an annoying interlude in alex and cyprien story.the romance between thierry and jema makes sense...jaus not being victor is sad but not disappointing.also alex and cyprien are very much involved in story so do not fear that their tale is over..far from it.
3,Not my favorite of the series,"This second installment of the Darkyn series was not one of my favorites. I didn't like all the time spent on Jema/Thierry in dreamland. Once again I skipped over all the boring John Keller parts, though I think she is setting him up for a more major part in the Darkyn world later. The romance wasn't that good either. As usual there is too little romance, and in this book particularly, the H/H spend little time with each other.The book did however carry on with the Darkyn and I like that Alex and Michael are actively involved in each story. You would not want to skip this installment in the series and the books should be read in order."
2,Not as good as the first one.....,"I thoroughly enjoyed her first book but this second one left me cold. 150 pages in and I still didn't really know what the plot was. Too many characters (Did we really need Beanie and her fecal artwork?) and too much wandering around with scenes that didn't build up to anything at all. It was as if the author couldn't decide who or what the book was supposed to be about so she just hopped around hoping something interesting would come out of the mix. It didn't.I finally got so bored that I turned to the end just to see where it all settled, something I NEVER do. I usually have to read every word of a book, but that would have just been more torture than even the Brethren can dole out.I like her ideas so I'm still hoping for more from the third installment."
3,Not as good as the first one,"Too many characters with too many motivations to keep track of. The heroine comes off as a clueless, dimwit. Not enough sexual tension or a clear enough plot."
3,A Beginners Friend Jumping Into Electrochemistry!,"This book is a good starter book for people who are interested in taking electrochemistry. This book explains an overview of equations used in electrochemistry. You will have to go to Allen J. Bard to get a more fundamental approach to electrochemistry. However, this book is useful to jog one's memory about a certain instrumentation used and quick equation look up. This book really helped tremendously while I took my electrochemistry course."
4,A bit advanced,A good book for advanced senior Chemistry students or graduate students. The content is good but you will need extra time to digest everything.
3,"Scholarly, Well Researched, Dense with Theory","Susan Hayward has done a good job putting together a compendium of cinema concepts. Her work is very scholarly and well researched with a good deal of additional references (for further reading.)Professor Hayward's bio says she is a Professor of French Studies. It shows in her book. If you feel like you haven't had your fill of post modernism, semiotics and structuralist/post structuralist theory, this book will get your diet straight.This isn't the kind of book you'd just sit down and read from cover to cover. It's more of a reference. My complaint is that the book is a little dry and dense.However, if you need a reference book on cinema concepts, this is a good choice."
3,Engaging book but an inacurate description of a Rumford.,"While we owe Vrest Orton a big ""thankyou"" for helping to resurect the Rumford fireplace, which was all but forgotton, as he said, in 1969, he got a lot of the history and details wrong - mostly slanting the fireback and neglecting to round the breast. I have no doubt that Orton accurately described the fireplace in his home in Vermont. I have seen many fireplaces said to be Rumfords which had slanted backs. While it's a common variation, it's not a Rumford. Read Rumford's own essay reprinted in The Collected Works of Count Rumford Vol 2 edited by Sanborn C. Brown for the real stuff. But Orton wrote an engaging little book. I'll give it a ""3"". - Jim Buckley"
3,Great Sound!! Lousy Interface.,"I have purchased Pioneer for a couple of decades and have always been pleased with my purchases until I recently installed this head unit in my vehicle. Main reasons for purchase was the Pioneer brand and the Bluetooth connectivity. I took it for granted that this great looking unit would sound great-which it does. The disappointment is how difficult this unit is to use. Difficult to program-presets as well as adjusting the clock. Iphone connectivity issues-no transfer of address book and no auto connect. But once connected great sounding calls. Lacks built in ipod connectivity-need to add an adaptor.Bottom line: Do your research, do not buy just because its a top of the line Pioneer."
5,Absolutely great!,"Wonderful car audio system! Great sound quality, great display and the bluetooth works like a dream!"
4,Good Receiver but pricey!!,Pioneer is known for good In dash Receivers I bought this for a friend you can hear his car coming blocks away it is on the pricey side could be cheaper but a solid receiver with a lot of extras would by again at a reduced price.
2,Not All That!!! at all,"Great receiver with lots of adjustments, however . . .First, just to set the time, you need an engineering degree. I have to refer back to the directions everytime to reset it. I'm a very techie person, and normally NEVER have to use the manual after the first adjustment on home theatre, car stereo, computers, etc . . . So, when I have to go back to the manual, something isn't right. Next, the only adjustment wheel SUCKS!!! If you push it and aren't exactly in the middle of the button, you end up going to another menu instead of selecting the item you wanted. It's better with the remote. Great display, except you can't see it in bright sunlight and it's distracting at night. The bluetooth mic sounds like you're 15 feet away, so I had to go back to my headset. Pioneer need to go back to multiple dials and buttons. This SUCKS!!!"
1,SCAMS BY AMAZON,"First I would like to say that I ordered a new item and recieved a used damaged item and did not recieve a full refund for my purchase that I returned for not being what I had ordered. I will NEVER purchase nothing from amazon ever again. You promise an A to Z guarentee and did not respond to my email I sent you reguarding the 70.00 that you still owe me. I did contact the BBB and have informed friends about your false advertizing. You dont even inform customers of any issues when they call you to return a product. I hope you feel good about scaming internet users, because you just lost one."
1,Speaking as someone who was part of the scene at the time:,These guys were the biggest poseurs ever. End of story.
2,handle will deteriorate over time,"I was initially pleased with this purchase, but just threw the knife out today. The handle is starting to leave large amounts of black residue on both our hands and dishrags. It appears to be disintegrating. I've probably owned them for a couple of years and have been running them through the dishwasher most of the time. The blade stayed sharp, it is only the material on the handle that I will never be purchasing again."
1,"Those that can, do. . .","Everything I despise about the US poetry scene is represented in this bloated book full of valetudinary pronouncements, unqualified gasbag vaginismus, put-downs of poets, and general editorial self-congratulatory harumphing. Such a critic as William Logan makes a career out of deorgating his betters. Shaw comes to mind. Those that can, do. Those that can't, gripe. Parnassus is a mountain of gripery."
4,"Hardly for everyone, but amazing for a few of you","This is a stuffy, stodgy, & all in all difficult book, a mammoth dissertaion on a confluence of somewhat obscure subjects. That's why I knocked it down a star.But, basically, it's also a lucid and frighteningly thorough study of what (for lack of a better term) I will call ""literarily serious science fiction."" It keeps slipping into a paean to the godhood of Samuel R Delany -- but since I would hardly be one to argue with that, this is hardly a black mark. (You *do* own at least one Delany novel... right? No? Bad puppy.)In backhanded fashion, this book also forms a central node for attempts to define that horribly overworked & vague term from the 1990s, ""postmodern.""Don't even try to read this unless you are Very Serious about Delany, modern literature, or science fiction -- preferably all three. But if that's you, then you need to read this book, probably four or five times."
3,"Good, but could use one important feature","I purchased the Polycom SoundStation2 for Nortel Network phone systems. Works fine with our Nortel Meridian phone system.But there is one 'minus' for me...For group conference calls, you need to use the Polycom SoundStation2 to call the other parties . The other parties can't call your Nortel Meridian phone system, and then you transfer their calls to the Polycom SoundStation2."
5,"Excellent multi-function machine - easy to setup networking, fast printing, easy faxing","This machine does exactly what it says it does, and to my experience everything has worked flawlessly. The user interface, buttons, etc. are all intuitively placed and very user friendly.Fax - easy, simple setup, have not had any issuesPrint - fast clear textScan - I have not used the scan feature yet, but I do know to use this function the machine needs to be hooked up to the PC directly - cannot network scan, which is fineNetwork - This is really where the printer shines - setting up networking was a total cinch and it works perfectly. I can print from laptops all over the house with no problems.All in all, this is a great machine and deserves 5 full stars."
3,MF5770,Things I wish were better with the MF5770:1.) A seperate tray for Letter and Legal Paper.2.) The error setting and requirement to change paper if a Legal document is sent to the printer when it is configured for Letter leaving the printer useless until you reconfigure it and change paper. A real pain.The rest of the functions of the MF5770 seem to function as advertized.
2,misleading features,"we got this for a small office and were excited to have it on the network for our scanning and faxing needs, not until the package was opened and the users manual was downloaded did we find out that the machine does not support network scanning or faxing. now it is just a copier. that part works as it should, but it'disappointing that the rest does not suit our needs."
2,Setup Nightmare,"Though highly reviewed for its attributes, this product comes out of the box with built-in ulcers for the hapless owner. The documentation seems to have been translated from japanese, with clumsy syntax and word usage. The setup CD offers the choice of network or USB, not allowing for the use of both in this device with a USB-only scanner. I was plagued with an alarm bell and flashing LCD error message the first time I turned it on that prevented printing, was not described in the troubleshooting guide, and required tech support to unravel. While I can now print, the setup of scanner and copier have so far frustrated my best efforts. We all by now have purchased and setup enough complicated devices to know that careful engineering makes such ordeals unnecessary. The bottom line: if you are a glutton for punishment go ahead and order one of these, but buy the antacids first."
2,Has major hardware problems,"I bought this in 2007, 3 years ago. Used it fine until recently. Gave me error message, ""Download standby/connected."" Lots of people getting this message and usually means the unit is trash. People are going with Brother instead. When it works, it is wonderful. However, $600 is too much to pay in Amazon. I got it for $200 at Staples. But skip this unit and try a Brother. A friend has one and its worked for almost 10 years with no problems."
2,Unpredictable Error Message,"I have only had this unit for 1.5 years. Intermittently, there has been a strange error message (Download Connected/Download Standby), which Canon support says indicates a problem inside the printer that needs to be serviced. I have managed to get the problem fixed to date by unplugging and replugging the power cord, but it is unpredictable as to when it will be fixed. Could be minutes, could be hours. It has happened to me again recently, and this might be the final hour of its existence!! The cost of repair will probably be more than I paid for the unit. I have multiple HP units that have lasted years without problems. Back to HP for me!!!"
3,Decent for the price,"I have owned the ImageClass MF5770 for almost three years and use it for printing, scanning, and faxing for business purposes on my Vista-based laptop. Here are my impressions based on my experience with my machine:PROs: It still prints, scans, and faxes after three years. The printed documents look fine. The scanning software does what I need it to do for PDF's and JPEG's.CONs: The automatic scan feeder produces angled scans, which is unacceptable for scanning documents for business purposes. You cannot print to this printer over a network from a Mac. The output bin sometimes feeds documents into a mess on the floor."
4,MFP Purchase,"We needed a less expensive alternative for church leaders to use in preparing materials to share in their various projects.Took me a little longer to set up than I expected because there is a plastic piece that goes on the back of the machine I couldn't figure out how to install from the directions. It turned out to be vital in holding the paper tray in place so it would stay shut. Once I got that figured out, it has worked well. It will colate (which is very helpful in some printing projects). We are using this totally as a copy machine. So have not tried to set it up to use directly with a computer.So far, we are very pleased."
1,factory defect,"Indeed, I too have ordered this album twice and both were defective. Indeed, I too was wondering if I was going crazy. There is clearly a batch of unpressed 'Future Days' CDs on the loose. Buyer beware. Peace."
1,blank cd,"cd came blank, I like the sound of nothing but don't feel I need to pay for it. Nice work on that one."
4,Get the video too!,"I used this as a teacher for many years. Our district got a new adoption thyat is not as well organized, nor are the videos as interesting. I still use the original videos in my class now that I have digitized them!"
4,...great addition to my kettle grill rotisserie setup,"Was looking for a healthier method of cooking hot wings. This basket solves the problem of eliminating the added fat that traditional deep frying introduces. The rotisserie wings crisp up just like fried...takes the sauce nicely. Last weekend was the fifth time using this item within a month of purchase.As for the basket, it is easy to use. The cover is flexible which allows for inconsistent shaped items to be secured together without movement during rotation. The cleanup is simple too. This item would have received five stars but the tabs that houses the screws which secures the basket to the spit rod bends easily if overtighten...so do be careful. Other than that, it is a great addition to my kettle grill rotisserie setup."
3,Not Big Enough,"I bought this to go with my grill's rotisserie for making chicken, fish, veggies, etc. It feels kind of cheap, the thumb screws are flimsy and it is hard to clean, even after spraying non-stick spray on it before use. My first use was a few chicken leg quarters but I could barely get it to closed due to the chicken sitting up to high. While cooking, it slipped around a lot, even after tightening the screws all the way down (which felt like they were going to break). I guess I can use it just for veggies, if I can get it tightened down well enough. Over all, it's okay but I wish I had bought something a little sturdier and better made."
4,Spit Basket,Great concept but it would be better if the spit went thru on the bottom of the basket instead through it
3,"Good for occasional use, not a strong tool","Made from pretty thin materials, you can use this occasionally but if will fall apart with repeated use.Mostly, the receivers and tabs that your rotisserie rod slides through are really thin and flimsy. There are two of them- one on each end of the basket, that each has a small thumb screw to cinch down on the rotisserie rod after it's in place. You can easily over-tighten it and bend those tabs. You have to get it tight enough that it'll hold the basket from moving around, but not so tight as to bend and deform it. Anyone with a welder, some small pieces of steel and some fabrication/ mechanical aptitude can easily strengthen it by adding some material.Also, as is it is unbalanced when loaded. Some rotisserie arms have a counterweight that you'll need so this doesn't go thump... thump... as it rotates."
3,Not Non-Stick,"The three stars are for non-stick surface because it allows stuff to stick. Everything else worked fine except it was about 3.5"" too long and 1.5"" too wide to use it and anything else on my grill. I could not even use myWeber Style 32903 Professional Grade Grill Pandirectly on the flavor bars and use indirect heat to cook them."
4,Rotissserie Grill Basket Review,"This grilling basket is easy to use and makes grilling chicken, fish, or hamburgers a breeze to cook without sticking. Setting it up on my rotisserie lets me cook with lid closed and cooks evenly to a goden brown. Easy to clean and use over and over again."
4,cool - and toasty warm!,Perfect length to wear with or without boots - great charcoal color - better quality than others. I would recommend.
5,Leg warmers,Never thought I would buy leg warmers again. Been over 25 years since i worn them. I wear leggings alot. It is cold where I live and just took a chance. I love these leg warmers.
2,"Itchy, do not stay up. Not warm compared to other brands.","Shipper was terrific, however, I do not recommend these leg warmers for the following reasons: thin, therefore not warm, itchy scratchy against my skin, and finally they do not stay up (fall down around crew neck socks). I am really bummed because I lost a pair of terrific leg warmers I bought at Sam Moon last year that were soft, thick, warm and stayed up all the time."
5,great leggings!,"these are the best leg warmers!!! they are warm, but not hot, and stay put fabulously - and a great price. thanks!"
5,Great Legwarmers,These look good and feel good. I got them to wear under boots and over jeans. Very well made. Super soft and beautiful yarn as well. I recommend you get these if you are shopping for legwarmers.
4,Leg warmers,Nice I got them in gray.seem nice but not sure if they may stretch out and not stay up.the knit is very unloose not tight. Will keep you posted. Really like the color
4,great quality,My wife who is very particular loves the quality of this product. they arrived very quickly especially for being just before Christmas.
5,Very hot!,"I wear these with similar shoes,as in pic with the... Mix & Match Sexy Metallic Black Double Layered Ruffle A-Line Mini... a g-string and fishnet top..."
2,sloppy,"I was cold so I ordered the leg warmers. However the yarn does not hold it's shape, it just keeps on stretching out. Oh well!"
5,FAST Shjipping! GREAT Leg Warmers,I love these leg warmers. I have them in 3 colors. Very comfortable and warm.
4,Came in late but..,"Arrived several days late, but got five US dollars after giving neutral review. Sent me an email and I love the leg warmers."
3,4 all year round!,"leg warmers are the best thing to add with a cute denim miny. they match with almost anything,because the heavy cable knit leg warmers come in nice nuteral colors that makes it easy for even the un-fashionable people to look fashionable."
5,Cozy Calves,These leg warmers are just the ticklet. I don't move around much & this old house is cold & drafty. They stay up and keep the chill off my lower legs. I hand wash them and lay them flat to dry. They have held their shape & given me no problems. These are my first leg warmers. They pull on & peel off easily and have given me no problems.
1,Did not work for me.,Not sure why it didn't work for me. I tried every possible combination of hooking it up and i used several different cables that i know worked and still nothing. I hooked the cable from device to device and it worked but once i tried hooking to the switch i got nothing.
5,Toslink Selector Switch,This product is simple and does what it is supposed to. Appears to be a quality made item. Can't find anything like this in stores. Amazon comes through again!
2,"Worked great initially but then,..","I Received the item very quickly from Amazon. It worked great initially but the audio on my receiver started ""cutting out"" after a week or so. After some experimentation, I determined that it was in fact the switch that was causing the problem. I gave the switch 2 stars because it did work initially, but unfortunately, is virtually unusable now after only 3 weeks! I am hoping that perhaps I just happened to receive a flawed switch."
1,Toslink Toslink Selector Switch to the trash it must go!,"Cables to Go 28734 Digital Audio Explorer Toslink Selector SwitchI tried this out and hooked my optical cables to it in various configurations, yet it does not work at all. This device does not work. I bought this based on all the positive reviews and yet as soon as I connected the optical cables and turned the switch......NOT A SOUND. I tested my cables without this contraption...AUDIO WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR!!! So why doesn't it work and how do I return this product to the purchaser. I'm deeply dissatisfied with this piece of junk!!! My first time of ordering from Amazon a product that does not work. DEEPLY dissatisfied to the core!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!How can a person verify if a product is good prior to purchasing it. I thought the reviews should have suffice, but yet it left me $18 in the hole....."
2,Do not buy,"I have been using this product for already 6 months. I connected my PS3, stalite receiver and DVD player to a sound system for 5+1 surround.Firstly, DVD player never worked at all. It works perfectly when I connect it directly, but I couldn't hear anything using it with this device.PS3 functions well but I need to restart sound system several times before it recognizes the input. Again no problem with a direct connection without a hub.Lastly I'm not sure if satelite receiver works with it. It is a HD receiver and same as PS3 I can have sound after several trials but the sound is not surround.Anyways, for those who have doubts to buy, I strongly recommend you try other devices. I'm really disappointed with this one."
2,Great when it works,For some reason it worked for about a week flawlessly; now it works about 25% of the time. If my optical audio does not work when I rotate the wheel I have to end up disconnecting the whole thing and just doing everything manually which is quite frustrating. But when and if it works its great!
5,Good buy!!,"i was very satisfied with the speed at which the product arrived. this product is the reason that i found out that something was wrong with my ps3. for anyone that has multiple a/v and digital devices, this makes your life very simple. i am very happy."
1,Provide a Zero Rating Please,"I wish I could give this a 0 rating. The reason I say that is because it didn't work right out of the box. OK, I confess, it did work, but just to give me garbled and useless sound, and only then when I jiggled the switch just right. Really disappointing. It has been returned and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,In consistant operation,"At first I thought this device would work for me, than I actually tried to use it. I found that the signal attenuation through this device was so great that some digital sources worked and some didn't. For the other side I should add that part of the problem is that the source device needs to have a better signal output, so the fault needs to be divided a bit in this case. The source device in this case is the Sangean HDT-1X, I purchased this precisely because it had a digital out put and wound up having to use the analog output."
5,A great way to expand optical inputs,"While many customers seem to have issues with this product, I can happily say that my experience has been excellent. I have only been using the switch for a month, but so far, all three inputs are working perfectly.The switch is moderately sized and should easily fit into your existing setup. Up to a maximum of three devices can be hooked up simultaneously to the switch. A fourth optical cable will be needed to attach to your receiver or whatever device you are routing your sound through.The cables snap in tightly and the switch itself locks into place on the input you have selected. Since there is no power cord required, installation should take only minutes. If your AV equipment is lacking a suitable number of inputs, this switch will enable you to hook everything up quickly and easily."
5,It works,This optical audio switcher works great. I use it to switch between my Apple TV and HD PVR and it works as it should
3,worthit the $$,Worth it but you will probably need a TOS link optical amplifier. Get one on ebay for ~$15 otherwise the signal loss from this device might render devices useless.
2,disappointed,"In theory this unit should work great, unfortunately in practice it doesn't. You have to jiggle and try to get the incoming cable just right to get the signal to go though, then occasionally (I'm thinking from vibration)it blanks out. Every other toslink switch I've seen is like this so I'm wary about getting another one, but need something as there's only on toslink input on my surround sound. If you want something that just works after fiddling and is cheap, buy this, but if you want something that you don't have to fiddle with to make it work, let me know when you find it."
2,Not Worth It,"While the price makes the product seem worthwhile, it is in fact not. The cables function as designed but the flaw lies in the design of the switcher.It works by butting two male heads of the optical cables together. As they use light to transmit data, any break in that light will result in a faulty or non-existant signal.While I'm sure there are many customers that are satisfied with their product, I like to buy things that work. This is not one of those things."
1,Switch failed soon after installing,Pros: PriceCons: 2-3 minute delay in A/V receiver reading signal from cable entire switch; entire switch failed three weeks after installation; looking for alternative
3,Can be a Useful Switcher,"If you have a multi-faceted system, & have an all Toslink audio hook-up. this device is useful for changing between them."
5,Great product,It's nice to buy a product and get what you paid for. Also I have noticed no sound loss since hooking this up to my sat box and my Xbox 360.
4,Does what it says - but BIG,This thing does exactly what it's supposed to. It seems to pass the optical info through with no degradation in quality. The only possible drawback is that it is ENORMOUS - about 6 inches across.
3,Does as it should......sort of,"I bought this so that I could split my Optical signal from my PS3 to my Home Theater Receiver and my Tritton AX 720 gaming headset. It is solid and good quality, however I have noticed some quirks. Occasionally I get sound dropouts when using my Reciever. It is strange though, as I have a new Optical cable for my Tritton's and when I select that output channel (it can actually be any one of the 3 outs available) I have never had a sound issue. But when I select my HT Receiver (regardless of which of the 3 outs I connect it to) I can occasionally receive complete sound drops for a couple seconds. I would like to believe that it is because of an older optical cable but if I connect it directly with the same cable instead of using the Toslink Switch I have no issues. I'm going to try a new cable and see if that help and will update the review once complete."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT: WOULD NOT CARRY-OVER A SIGNAL,"Look elsewhere. This switch & all of it's different colored clones on amazon are very poorly made. The Switch mechanism itself it nice & tight, however the contact ports (3 in, 1 out) are VERY loose & poorly mounted. Because of this the optical signals don't line up inside of the product. I tried this with brand new cables (cable ends were new & not worn) & tested all of the cables. The problem definitely lies within the switch. Avoid this cheap product & use a better quality splitter."
1,Only lasts 6 months,"I won't spend time rewriting what others have written here, but after about six months, the signal gets spotty and cuts in and out. Don't waste your money."
1,Fiber Audio Switch Review,"I bought one of these audio switches on price and the few good reviews I saw. It worked for a few weeks and now doesn't work on one line. I should of realized just by the name alone ""dgital"" it was a cheap knock off.Take a look at other options rather than this one."
1,Piece 'o crapola,"Did not work at all, on any of the 3 switch settings.I have synapses that still fire, so I know enough to know to check my connections, jiggle the switch as others have suggested, etc.Even took it apart to see if there was something obviously wrong. It looked fine, so I'm blaming cheap parts and production techniques.Love the idea of this product, so I'm going to try another brand."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This switch box--which I bought to switch between my blue ray player and Xbox--worked for all of one month before dying a pathetic death. Presently, only one of the inputs is able to carry audio through it, making it worthless as a switch box. Alas, I am back to fighting through my rat's nest of cords in order to plug in the correct optical audio cord.I'm thinking about converting the switch box in to a coaster for my morning coffee, so at least I know my $14 was spent on a functional item. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your switch box needs."
2,Mostly works but lots of issues,"This is a pretty cheap piece of equipment. It took a lot of finessing to get the cables connected in a way that actually produced sound. Once it's set up it works fine usually, but the audio occasional cuts out for a second or so, and it seems to be getting worse. (I have been using this for a couple weeks now.)"
2,Pity it doesn't work with some computer inputs,"This switch does not work with my computer sound card. I tried plugging another source into the same socket, tried wiggling it, and made sure the computer sound card worked directly with my reciever/amplifier. The switch works great when switching other inputs, but it doesn't like optical input from my computer sound card at all.I even returned the original item just in case it was defective, but the replacement exhibits the same behavior. It really makes no sense to me, but I guess I'll try using a direct coupler (female+female) and just manually change cables each time instead. Well... until I drop $300-500 on a receiver/amplifier with more than one optical-in :)"
1,DOA,Product was dead on arrival. Passes light through but no sound. I have an older Sony receiver from circa 1999.
5,"Simple, direct, informative, and musical.",I enjoy listening to this little CD just for the music. The information is well organized and direct and the musical examples are well chosen.
4,Long Wait for Delivery.,"Shoes arrived extremely late. Quality is terrific, though. Aerosoles are great walking shoes."
4,Good shoes,I have owned the same shoes before (lasted for a year of every day use :). These were a little stiff in the beginning but adjusted to my feet after a week or two of use. After that they are the best shoes for me! (A few other brands i tried would never adjust to my feet and i would experience pain all the time :) Hope it helps :)
3,Inwardly curved last,"As much as I LOVE aerosoles shoes, this style is disappointing.It is made of the usual quality materials and cushioned nicely.But the shoe has an inwardly curved last, that basically means it fits best if you are pidgeon-toed.Now that I look again at the images, you can see it, but if it had been placed vertically it would have been more obvious.Put this one down to experience I guess.Sigh."
3,Very pleased with this shoe.,"This shoe is very attractive, and I am please with it. I was looking for something to wear with jeans and slacks that I could walk alot in. I have never had a pair of uncomfortable aerosoles!"
4,The only down side was the volume of the music,"This is a great work out if you like Latin music and you have some rhythm in your soul! The only down side was the music was not loud enough. If you can't move those hips, leave this one alone - guess that's what the previous reviewer should have done. Dance and Latin moves are entirely different!!"
3,Decent Product,"Decent Product. Drops downs on food items could be better, but good enough for the price."
4,"Pure soul, not as ""hot"" as some of the Numero Uno releases","What you will find here is ""classic 70's soul"" in all its many incarnations of the period-- plenty of falsetto vocals and other things that will remind you of famous artists contemporary to the time. In other words, little known artists performing songs in the mold of the Dells, O. V. Wright, etc. Nate Evans (who I believe graces the cover) is a ringer, vocally, for Lou Rawls. I admit I didn't find this as hot as some of the other Numero Uno releases such as Belize City Boilover and Grand Bahama Goombay, which are enlivened by their Carribean ethnic influences. Therefore the 4 stars instead of 5. But if you are looking for some pure 70's soul sounds, this is for you."
4,Great 70s Soul and Great Sound,"This is one of the best in a very good series. Great soul songs you've never heard, very well mixed and great (HDCD) sound quality."
2,Humayun Ali,"Provides a comprehensive framework for the management of operational riskDefines the spectrum of risks faced by organisations and how they can effectively manage these.However this books barely touches the true nature of operational risk from an analyst perspective. The modeling aspect is totally missing, rather just give a very macro level introduction to the risk and ways how it can be implemented in the financial institutions. A big NO BO for those who are interested in reading operational risk as a subject."
5,The Best of the Best,I have used Panasonic cordless drills for 10+ years now and can tell you that they are by far the best cordless product out there.I have a 15.6 volt drill and have used and abused it for 7 years and it still works flawlessly. Would highly recommend getting a cordless Panasonic.
4,Another great sing-along-with-Patty-CD!,"One of the best aspects of Patty Loveless' musical choices, as well as her voice, is that she can take you from sad to happy and back in three-songs flat! Here she accomplishes that feat once again. I especially enjoyed ""When Being Who You Are Is Not Enough"" and ""My Old Friend the Blues."" The former is a superb melancholy song with an underlying hope of resolve, accepting who you are when ""the right one"" doesn't."
4,My First Patty Loveless CD,I have been listening and enjoying country and western music for about 15 years but usually stayed within the range of more contemporary country. This CD showed me another side of country music that I enjoyed very much. A lot of the songs are in the traditional style and Patty Loveless' voice is well suited for this style. Listening to this CD was very enjoyable and I know it will be one that I will listen to over and over again.
2,Much of the same......,"I am a fan of Patty's. I must say though this album sounds like her last two. I must say On Your Way Home wasn't that bad. This is just boring. I want the old Patty who sang hits like Timber I'm Falling in Love, I'm that kind of girl, I try to think about Elvis to come back...I used to not hesitate to go out and purchase her albums...That has changed now!"
3,German Toy Made in CHINA?,"I specifically sought out a European toy which marketed itself as quality, safe, and German-made. I simply do not trust products made in China. The box came with English, French, and German descriptions. In tiny print on the box said ""made in China"". That was right under the part about being designed in Germany. I will never purchase another Haba toy. These used to be made in Germany. There are plenty of reasons not to buy from China aside from the lead and safety issues found in many of the toys made there. The unique selling feature of this product was that it was made in Germany. Other than that, it is just a set of wooden blocks and was not worth the price."
2,The Best Of Raw? The Worst Of Raw,"Although the video had some entertaining things, Most of it was a dissapointment. Unless you recently started watching wrestling, Skip this video, brings back a few memories but mostly a sucky review of WWF from about 2 years ago up."
1,"This Video Sucks, it just the suckiest home video","This video was only 75 min which is not enough, this video didn't show any wrestling matches, they only showed some sucky ones and they weren't the main event. There was only Interviews. They only showed fued between austin and mcmahon.it sucks"
4,I like it,"This Best of Raw,Vol. 1, I personaly thought was great there is only one little problem it's not a big problem but it was a little too much about the Austin/McMahon war still it was really cool i loved the Undertaker/Kane part if you have the DVD or VHS Austin vs McMahon then maybe you should not get it but if you don't,i truly recommend this to you cause it's great."
1,Waste of Money,"I love the WWF home videos, but this one sucked. Don't buy it. it wasn't the best of raw."
1,Rubbish,This isnt the best of videos from the WWF. Should have improved it by adding the 1993 - 1996 years. If you want to waste your money then buy this. It does include the forming of Dx & the impersination from Dx of the Nation but there are only clips of it. Very dissapointing.
2,NOT THE BEST OF RAW,"This video is not worth the money. It was alright though, it had KANE and UNDERTAKER it has some of THE ROCK, it also has MANKIND, VAL VENIS, SABLE, and DX. But the mane focuss is vince and AUSTIN. But the hole video is pritty much talking."
2,NOT THE BEST OF RAW!!!,"O.K. It goes like this: I recently sold my copy of this tape because I never watched it anymore. The first few times I watched this video (after I bought it) was fun. But after a while, it got boring. Most of the stuff on this video is just scenes & moments of the Austin-McMahon feud. If you want a video on the rivalry between S.C. Steve Austin & Mr. McMahon then go buy the McMahon vs. Austin home video.This video is uncensored too. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There's a scene in which Cactus Jack is cutting a promo in the ring, and he says the GD word twice.Also, there's a part where Val Venis is about to be castrated by some enemies, and you can see his nakad behind when security breaks into the locker room.The story of The Undertaker & Kane is kind of cool, but nothing much. This video focuses on the feud between Austin & McMahon too much. Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Find something else to buy."
2,My mommy say no,i am spencer and i bot this video and i =got m frind jon over but mymommy saidno and send jon hom
2,Best of.......Austin vs. McMahon??,"I wouldn't recommend buying this video at all. At least half of it is stuff about Austin and McMahon. If that's what you like to see, there is a video coming out about just them, so you should probably save your money for that. As for the rest of Best of Raw, it's mostly brief hightlights of the rest of the main WWF guys, and most of the highlights aren't exactly the ""best"" of Raw as far as I'm concerned. The only things that I thought would qualify as being the ""best"" of Raw was the DX parody of The Nation and The Undertaker's return to declare war on Kane. The rest was pretty much mediocre."
4,Where's the Beef?,"Boy some WWF fans just have nothing better to do but complain. The Austin vs McMahon Feud was the backbone of RAW. It deserves the amount of video time it received. I would have liked a bit more focus on The Rock. I like the Val Venus segments. They definitely were worth a chuckle or two. Some of the Undertaker/Kane stuff dragged on a bit in spots. Jackie vs Sable does not actually stand the test of time. However, the good clearly overshadows the bad. Dr Austin is the house. What more could you want?"
3,A BIG Letdown,I bought this tape cause I was expecting to see the best of Raw from all-time...not 1997 on!!! There was WAY TOO MUCH of Steve Austin...just buy an Austin video to see that stuff! The Val Venis segment was unnecessary...the only high point of the video was the DX impersonation of the nation...but they only showed clips!!! That whole interview and thier Corporation impersonation should have been included. WWF...if you make another Raw video...show us some older stuff and better highlights!!!
3,I am disappointed in the WWF,"I enjoyed this video just for making me remember all the past RAW moments that were so good. I do have a few complaints, though. Number one, Michael Cole's narration is really bad. Number two, all of the other WWF best of videos have some sort of wrestler comments or exclusive interviews. This video had none of that. Also, there is one scene where a little Japanese guy is attempting to castrate the superstar known as Val Venis. This little piece occured on Sunday Night Heat, not RAW. If you are lookig to add this video to your collection, buy it, but don't expect to watch it too often. If you are looking for a way to remember the classic moments of RAW through just a single video, buy one of Stone Cold's videos, after all, as Michael Cole says on here: SCSA is RAW."
3,A good recap of classic RAW programs from the last 2 years,"This is a good video showing clips of classic RAW is WAR programs from the last two years. It shows Steve Austin's many hellacious encounters with his boss, Mr. McMahon; the formation of both DXes, the Undertaker's battles with Kane and others; the break-up of the Nation of Domination; a brief, unique look at the women of the WWF. A video worth purchasing."
4,A great video!,I think this what was a very good video. It bought back alot of memories very entertaining. I like the recap of the Vince and Austin war. The Val Venis angles and etc. My favorite part was when Austin got Vince arrested and yes folks it's worth it. All the parts from this video were right on point I love this video. Like they say Raw is War and WWF is sports entertainment.
5,Timely Material and on Tagret,"There was a shooting at a school in Oklahoma on Dec. 6,1999 by a thirteen year old child. This book gives clear statistical data that shows that there is an identifiable link between adolescent and juvenile violence and the mental disorder schizophrenia. How timely can any work be. Excellent job!"
5,Swim To The Top,Excellent book for the experienced as well as the starter. Swimming becomes more fun and you are more competitive when you have a understanding of how your systems must all works together. Thanks to David Wright for writing this book.
2,My uneducated opinion,"I'm a new Tangerine Dream listener but when I came across Rubycon and Phaedra, I loved it. It was like nothing I'd ever heard before.....and I wanted more. This album was definately not what I was looking for. The synth textures are great but I can't stand the 80's sounding guitar melodies, and this cd is loaded with them. With so many albums it's very difficult to know which ones I will like I guess."
5,Creative,"I'm used to listen new age music and TD is my favorite new age band. Particularly I've been listening some of their old albums, because I always stayed on Rockoon and above. I found Underwater Sunlight and Dream Music 2 very, very interesting. Certainly their style has evolved. Electronically very sofisticaded and refinated, not too much beat, but enough to make you listen twice. Very mystic, inspirational and creative. 'Dolphin Dance' is very excellent and has some modern style. This song by itself makes the album a must."
4,comfortable croc flop....,Easy to wear from day one. The strap had a little crinkly sound to start out with...eased up with wear. Cute and comfortable. Footbed was a little slippery when wet. May be a problem running to get out of the rain ( or sprinkler).
5,COMFORTABLE AND VERSATILE,THESE WERE A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVES THEM. THEY ARE COMFY AND VERSATILE- SHE LIKES THEM TO JUST WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE AND PRESENTABLE ENOUGH TO RUN ERRANDS IN (ACCORDING TO HER).
2,Too flexible,Too flexible and can really hurt your feet when walking long distances. The only sturdy part is the heel.
3,Wish they had 1/2 sizes...,"I am a size 7.5 and ordered these in size 7, as most people that bought them claimed they ran big. They are indeed very comfortable...if you are not in the middle of sizes. The 7's were *just slightly* small...just so that you can't tell until you've walked a little and your feet keep slipping out of them. I know 8's will be too big, as these were nearly there, but not quite."
3,Crackling noise,"The shoes are exactly what I wanted, but when I walk the ""V"" part of the shoe makes this crackling noise. I still have not wore them for this reason."
5,Inexpensive shoes with expensive shoe features,"Over the last couple of years, I've noticed that I tend to get arch pain and leg pain easily when I'm wearing cheap shoes, esp. flip-flops. Unfortunately for my bank account, the only shoes that I can wear all day and not end up with pain easily run me $80+. I love flip-flops in the summer, and these Crocs are just perfect. They provide the support I need all day long. I can (and have) worn only these for a whole week at the beach and never experienced any foot or leg pain. At first, I balked at paying $35 for a pair of flip-flops, but after wearing my first pair for a summer, I was hooked. I consider them to be a bargain and now own 4 pairs. They look great with most summer outfits, too (admittedly, I'm a shorts-and-tee kind of girl, so they look great with most of MY outfits!) I will continue to buy these for as long as Crocs offers them."
5,CROC FLIP FLOPS,"THIS PAIR WAS A BIT LARGER THAN WHAT I LIKE, GAVE THEM TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW MY BAD AS THE KIDS USED TO SAY. LOVED THE COLOR AND THE PRICE, WISH I HAD GOTTEN A SIZE SMALLER."
5,Most comfortable-longest lasting sandals I have ever owned!,"I have owned a pair of these flip flops for over 4 years. OMG!! They are truly awesome! I wear them almost everywhere I go--summer and winter! Seriously, anytime I am going shopping or somewhere I need to stand for long periods of time, these are my go-to shoes. And I wear them gardening, too. They are easy to wash up and look like new in no time!"
5,Versatile and Comfy,"In my opinion there is no more comfortable sandal than Crocs capri. I have several pairs and alternate colors. Their non slip surface is great (until they wear down, which they do eventually) and the connection between the big toe and 2nd toe is very comfy. Crocs are also versatile and we use them on our sailboat because of their non slip properties.."
5,LOVE THE CROCS!!,"My daughter gave me the exact same pair last year for Mother's Day. I love them!! They have held up very well and I know this because I wear them almost everyday... So I purchased the same one's from my daughter for Mother's Day who became a Mother in February! She was always asking for mine...now she has her own. Their comfortable, durable and still look good after constant wear. Most def worth the money!!"
2,weird sizing,"I bought these as a gift. The size 6 is much closer to a 7, so I ended up having to exchange for a size 5. I bought some other styles of Crocs which ended up being a full size too SMALL, so the Crocs sizing seems to be very inconsistent."
4,Great service to get a great shoe!,"My sister, for whom I purchased these flip-flops, just had my niece, and she was so excited to get them! The nubs on the shoe she says feel great, not to mention the trademark Croc squishiness. Her husband was so curious about her claims, even he had to try them on! He loved them, too! That makes buying his Christmas preasent easy this year! PS They live in South Florida.Women's Crocs Capri"
5,VERY comfortable - great for long walks!,"If you are looking for a comfortable flip flop, this one is definitely for you!I bought these about a year and half ago and absolutely love them. I wear them a lot during the summer months.These Crocs flip flops have a fabric strap that fit around your foot quite well. They also have an amazingly comfortable rubber insole/sole. I wear a nine, and that is what I bought. They fit me perfectly.I chose the turquoise and grey pair which matches/blends very well with a wide variety of colors and outfits.I wear these when I take my dog on lengthy 4-6 mile walks in the summer instead of wearing my gymshoes. The Crocs hold up well and are still very comfortable even on long power walks.These are durable, water-proof, comfortable, and cute. I highly recommend them."
1,Very disappointed,"After all the hype that the radio stations made about this album, I was disappointed. I expected to hear great music. But all I found was ""Bailando""...what's up with ""ya...ya...ya""? Couldn't they come up with better lyrics? And as for ""Tears are Falling"", it sounds like they copied other songs. No offense to Angelina, I know it's probably not her fault. But I wasn't impressed with this album. Looks like I won't be ordering this one."
1,Come on angelina? Did you expect the public to like this???,"I was never a huge fan of dance music and this cd has made me realize why. Angelina has potential but doesn't apply it. At least not in this cd. Her first one wasn' t gold but it sure sounded better than then this one. I think it's time she considers another line of work. NO wonder why she will never win a grammy. Work on the voice, update the music, and then attempt to put out a decent product."
5,Best Female Artist Ever,Angelina...is by far the best latin women singer ever. All of her songs make all of us want to dance and the lyrics are just great. Hugs and kisses to Angelina
2,not as good as first album,"angelina's first ablum had at least 4 hit singles, this ablum just lets u hear 3 songs, those that i heard were weak songs, but i do know that she has one that is pretty good i think it is called ""bailando"" or ""time to start the party"" maybe they didn't put that song here or maybe it is here but is different name, anyway ablum not worth it, but 1 single is"
4,"Uplifting, invigorating, distinctly fresh music","Even with the remake of popular (sometimes overplayed) songs, this music is so refreshing it is a must for anyone's collection...it is not something you want to hear every day, but when you are down and need a little perking up, this will do the trick!!!"
4,What a Great Concept,"I found this an entertaining introduction into the work of some great authors I hadn't read before, and of course the subject matter is fascinating.I realized part way through that this is a very modern American product. Take short excerpts of famous writers works that involve debauchery, have it short enough to read in a couple of days, and market with bright red, white and blue with the word SCREWING on the cover. Maybe this is an ingenious way to hook regular Joes into reading a little good literature. In any case it worked for me."
4,"Tomar, fumar y joder!!!!!!!!!!!","Drinking, Smoking and Screwing es la entrada a los excesos. Los excesos visto desde la perspectiva de varios escitores que tocan el tema del lado sórdido de la vida. Si usted está deprimido, prepárese, posiblemente se deprimirá más y querrá tomar una sobredósis de 1)sexo, 2)alcohol 3)drogas o cigarrillo.

Claro que se va a divertir con este libro y vale la pena recordar (a veces con pena, otras con gozo) a través de las historias situaciones que a uno le han sucedido. Recomiendo especialmente la historia ""Women"" de Charles Bukowski."
1,Awesome . . . . until it broke w/less than 100 hrs of use,"This is an incredible machine . . . awesome picture quality . . . when I purchased it two years ago the only reviews were positive . . . we put this in in our cabin so it didn't get much use . . . with less than 100 hours of use, the picture would go blank and we would have to turn the power off and turn it back on several times in order for it to finally stay on . . . . it's still that way and Panasonic has not been very easy to deal with . . . totally unfair for them not to replace this problem on a new machine."
1,Panasonic must recall this projector,"My PT-AX100U's iris broke after 10 months of use. 8 months after the iris was replaced, the new iris broke again. Since so many people reported this problem, Panasonic must recall this projector."
4,Good performance but multiple quality control issues,"First off, this is only a good, but not great, projector. With the way projector prices have been falling, there are other options for less that deliver comparable performance. The Sanyo Z5, for example, costs several hundred dollars less and actually produces a sharper picture as well as including twice as many digital inputs as the Panasonic. I bought this model last September and have already had to send it in twice to get fixed. In fact, it's on its way to the repair center as I am typing this review. This is not an isolated incident either, MANY PT-AX100 owners have been experiencing problems just like mine and it's clear that Panasonic didn't spend enough time/money on quality control. Go read through any HDTV or projector forum for a laundry list of issues regarding this projector. The decision is up to you, but I would advise people to look elsewhere if they want to avoid a potential headache."
1,Same problem,I didn't buy this unit on amazon but i am having the same problem with the unit shutting down. i came on here to see if maybe i could buy a replacement bulb to fix the problem since in the upper left of my screen it says replace bulb. well now after reading reviews on here i guess a new bulb won't fix the problem. it saddens me to hear that for the chunk of cash (as little as it may be) still should last me more than the 2 years that i have had it. don't get me wrong i loved it when it worked it might not have had the best high def picture quality but who can complain when it's your whole wall! again disappointed that i now have to search for a replacement unit... any suggestions?
2,"Great picture, unreliable","This is a great project when it works... I have had the same problems as many others. I have only 700 hours on this project and it will shutdown approx. 5 minutes after being on. At first it only happened once, however it now seems to happen twice when it's first powered up. Hopefully, Panasonic will pony up and replace this defective project. I will update this once I find out."
3,Great till the problems start,"Purchased 4 years ago and it did great up till recently. Once it dimmed down and started having the issues I contacted Panasonic who said they'd look at it if I shipped it to them (my cost) then paid $130 to diagnose. I checked their website and found a local repair shop. That shop basically said it's a great unit when it works, but there are three main issues with it, and that it sounds like I have one of those issues....and if I repair it, the other two will most likely appear soon as well. Time to buy a different unit I think."
1,RELIABILITY / IRIS PROBLEM. BEWARE!!!!,"STAY AWAY. Great projector until it breaks. After 600-800 hours of lamp life, most users of this product will experience a stuck iris, resulting in the projector turning itself off, forcing you to turn it back on with decreased brightness. Panasonic will not recall the item, so it needs to be sent in for repair under warranty. This is a well documented issue on forums, so do some research. I am waiting on mine to be returned from Heartland (Panasonic's repair site in Kansas). The projector performs beautifully when it works. Terrible reliability."
4,Hmm...rebranded?,"If you ever go to Asia, don't bother buying this here, wait till you go. I got this at a ""dollar store"" back home in Malaysia for two RINGGIT, which at the time of writing is 60.7 US cents.It's held up decently after about a year of use. It stopped working after a while but was easily fixed by bending the metal contacts inside back into shape. I don't think it's waterproof as there's no gasket. Takes 1 AA battery. The pointy tips feel ok if you're the kind of person who likes to exfoliate your face a lot.If you really want to buy this here in the USA, there's a _remarkably_ similar product listed in the Sexual Wellness section of Amazon.com as ""California Exotics Compact Waterpro Vibrator"", which IMHO is more honest than selling it as a facial massager. C'mon, which end of the body do you think it's more likely to be used at?"
1,Didn't like it,The price seemed great at 1.99 but when the price of shipping was added the price totaled about the same price as what I paid (including shipping) for a $6.00 similar product and it wasn't as nice as the other similar priced item. The attachements are very sharp and scratch you. Its also very loud. Not worth it.
3,California's Mission Trail,"Nice video, but the title for this is not correct and misleading. It has nothing to do with California's mission trail. I hope this description is corrected so that others aren't potentially dissapointed."
2,Don't last.,"I mounted a pair on my Honda odyssey headlights but the LEDs burned out in less than 5 months. They are also very dim, but are still cool!"
3,The enchanting melody of the strings,"The tunes in this album highlight the part of the strings. The strings play their phrases so quickly that they become a part of the rhythm section. TU TRANQUILO and DE LA HABANA (A MATANZAS), which is played in the rhythm called Guaguanco, are good examples of it."
5,WC Fields by Curtis,"This book should be reviewed in conjunction with ""The Films ofWC Fields by Deschner"". WC Fields was a complex personality.He seemed aloof from people personally. His childhood was difficult although he perfected the art of juggling during that time. He made a host of popular films including :- Running Wild- Two Flaming Youths- Fools for Luck- Her Majesty Love- International House- It's a Gift- The Man on the Flying Trapeze- My Little Chickadee- Tales of Manhattan- Song of the Open Road- WC Fields and the Cosmos and many moreThis work will be invaluable for film enthusiasts everywhere."
1,Still an awful book,"I wrote an honest and professional review before, I won't bother again because enough people complained. When I decided to have fun with my review you must have complained again because it was removed. Basic synopsis: Long, boring, tries to rewrite history to paint WC as a saint which is complete bull. James Curtis blames everyone and anything else for his problems. He is too much a fanboy and comes off as such in his writing. WC was an alcoholic, fascinating, complicated, talented and funny man. One author can not erase all his flaws."
2,Dell XPS M170 will not boot with this adapter,"Although this generic adapter claims compatability with the Dell XPS M170 laptop among others, this particular model will not allow the computer to boot. The system claims that the adapter is not 130W, even though all the technical specs on the back of the adapter exactly match the original. The system runs fine if already started up, but it can't start or restart unless on battery."
2,Short cord - weird operation,"I wouldn't recommend this product. The cord is EXTREMELY short and I have to use an extension cord just to use it. Also, when I plug in my laptop, the adapter doesn't charge unless you then unplug the adapter from the wall and then plug it back in."
2,NOT FOR DELL M90,computer won't boot....shows wrong wattage (states that adapter is only 90W). Dell Precision M90 uses adapters in the PA-13 family. Gave it two stars because it looks like it works for only CERTAIN Dell computers that require 130W (Inspiron 5150 and 5160). Certainly not for M90's.
4,Replacement Power Adapter for Dell,"My original Dell power adapter (PA-1131-02D) failed in a nearly spectacular way. Normally outputting 19.5 V DC, something broke inside and it started to output 50 V AC. The laptop must have an internal circuit breaker because the battery symbol started flashing orange and green, and the computer started to operate erratically.The replacement power adapter (branded ""Dekcell"") arrived within the predicted delivery period and has operated well since then (1 month). The Dekcell adapter is always cool, where the old Dell adapter was always extremely hot in operation.Dekcell Model ST-C-150-19500670CT. Output 19.5V DC, 6.7 Amps."
4,Great Price; Great Product,"This charger is a replacement for an OEM Dell charger. The unit itself is only about half the wieght of the OEM, but the cord(s) are only half as long. Thus, costing a star out of 5 star rating. Have had it for a couple of months now and planning on purchasing another for the office."
1,doesn't fit the device it was listed to work with,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my mother for her laptop computer. It didn't fit the computer that it was listed to be a match for and she had to buy another one on her own. By they time Christmas had come, the chance to return this device was gone. Suffice to say, there's no need to purchase from this company again."
3,Gets really hot,"Purchased this power cord because the one that came with my computer died. This power cord got SUPER hot to the touch that I didn't like it being near anything. I'm not sure what happened to this cord because I gave that computer and accessories to my brother. Although it got hot, it did charge my computer and battery which is what I needed."
4,Finally one that works!,"After 3 failed attempts of finding an AC adapter for my Dell Inspiron 5160, this one finally worked! My first attempt was through Amazon but a different seller. Didn't work. Tried one at Walmart. Didn't work. Was guaranteed one would work at Best Buy. It didn't. I was going to try one last time before I would give up and buy a new laptop. I wanted to go through Amazon again because they have a great and easy return policy. Found one. It was through a different seller but more expensive. Tried it and it works. Yipee! Thanks."
4,You may never look at dessert the same way again.,"This is good fun although at times very silly but often does carry forward an important message about the problems of anthropomorphism and how we would deal with strange looking visitors from other worlds. I think biologists would have a field-day but in ""It Came From Outer Space"" the aliens are so ugly as to scare humans into a kill frenzy.A saucer crashes, an astronomer sees the alien, reports it to the town, the alien body snatches, well borrow bodies temporarily and tries to find a way to escape before it is found. The moral of the story is that even Jelly-like beings can be as smart as Einstein and us Earth people can be awfully narrow-minded, however The Day the Earth Stood Still does it better."
4,Typical Period Sci-Fi,"I knew what I was getting when I made this purchased. A very chessy scifi movie. That it was. I liked it, not loved it."
4,I love 1950's & early 60's alien movies,"It Came From Outer Space is a good movie to watch. I like the story and the scenes in the desert. Richard Carlson, Barbara Rush and Charles Drake did an excellent job. I liked the story."
4,Good stuff not costing millions to make.,"Very good Sci Fic movie. Drama and plot unfold, along withgreat special effects for its time, to compensate for today's milliondollar movies with their million dollar special effects.A true classic that belongs in your library collection."
3,how about some good 3-D films,"I saw this film in its orginal 3D effect as well as the creature from the black lagoon also in 3D at a college theatre on a saturday afternoon matinee. Eventhough these films were done over fifty years ago, to audiences at that theatre, the experience was first rate. Please try to get hold of these films in the orginal format, the experience in 3D is worth the price of admission or of DVD."
5,SEMINAL VEHICLE!!,"I was too young at three to see this one at the theater, but Daddy told me it was one of the first in the ""Invaders From...."" genre, along with ""The Thing"", to use the device of the seldom-glimpsed or barely seen monster. That Ray Bradbury wrote the screemplay is an amazing plus. I watched this with my three-year-old granddaughter, and we ""pretended"" to be scared so we could cuddle on the couch! Grampa 'was' the alien in the fishbowl, POV shots, 'chasing' little Amie over the bolsters! SEE THIS WITH A KID!"
2,weak in the dialog,On the plus side you get to see how society was in the 1950'sand the lady in it is quite cute. It's a black and white moviethough.The problem is that the dialog is lame. He goes to the policeand reports aliens. Everyone thinks he is crazy. The alienstake the form of humans.It's not that bad of a movie but there is a lot of lame talkinstead of a lot of action.
5,"This is a ""must have"" for 50's Sci-Fi fans!",This movie purchase was the best money I have spent in a long time...truly a priceless classic! The sound effects brought me back to a Saturday afternoon in our small town movie theatre! The acting was WONERFUL and the special effects riveting....coupled with the sound effects that give this movie the campy appeal that makes me love movies 1950's Sci-Fi!!
2,DVD Transfer Is Blurry / Out Of Focus,I have a tv version from 16mm which is 72 min. & it is way sharper imagewise than the DVD. The cuts were made to give tv more time for commercials although the first cut - the first shot of the monster gives a bit of mystery. Universal made a mistake by showing too much of the monster thereby loosing alot of mystery. The exact opposite of Creature Of The Black Lagoon. I just don't like the DVD. Its blurry as can be.
4,Refreshingly Classic 50s Sci-Fi,"I can't believe I missed this one. I thought I've seen them all. IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is indeed a classic. It has all the elements we love: male-female interactions on the edge of cultural upheaval, pacific impulses vs macho reactionism, aliens made of foam, taking over bodies, and even a ""posse"" in cowboy hats. I don't want to give much away if, like me, you haven't seen this one. Unlike most of this type, I wasn't sure how it was going to end."
3,WHY ISN'T THIS MOVIE COLORISED? B/W IS BORING.,"The cover of this dvd and even the screen samples on the back are in color and look fantastic, but the movie is in BORING BLACK AND WHITE. I feel a little decieved because the front and back of this dvd is in color but the movie is in black and white. Colorised versions of 50's and 60's movies(for example the Munster's pilot episode) look great and i'm very surprised most of these movies are not being colorised causing quite a bordom for my eyes. When are colorised tv sets coming out so I can change all that myself."
4,'A-',"I must say, I am impressed. Forstchen has a peculiar ability to keep the reader *gripped* (in most of his books), and The Gamester Wars is no exception. Weaving a tale of the travesties of the super-rich and super-bored, Forstchen manages to highlight their childishness without going overboard. Which is one thing Forsthcen never does, is go overboard. As engaging as it is, The Gamester Wars never get into that realm of absolutely perfect and beautiful story; it's a fun read, and a good read, but it's not quite one of those books that everyone should have in his or her library. Even so, it's definitely worth the read."
2,I should spend my time doing something more productive,"Basically a piece of dreck. I should spend my time doing something more productive. These guys really exploit a niche, like good little bacteria. Forstchen wrote one of the greatest Sci-Fi books of the past few years with 'Rally Cry' - but then follows it up with something like this. I am shocked and dismayed."
3,"Good production values, the computer effects were a little too much","I think they needed to make this about an hour or two longer to have better character development and draw people in to sympathize with the characters and buy into the story. As it is currently, it's feels really rushed between scenes that seem to happen months (or even years) apart. There isn't much chance for the characters to flesh out there stories or even the background behind this historical drama. The scenery and costumes were great, but the fight sequences were a little over the top and too much like the ""300"" in having very stylized (and obviously computer generated) graphics."
3,SWORD WITH NO NAME,DVD hesitated only a few seconds 1/2 way through the movie but was a fine story and a fine movie.
2,Opportunity Missed,"The history surrounding Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min) in terms of the, then modern & westernized, innovations she encouraged; the political dynamics within the Joseon Dynasty and with Japan, Russia and western nations (including the US) all would make a fascinating epic movie. But, in this case, all we get is a hint of that story as the movie seemed more focused in creating a fictionalized romantic tryst between her and a peasant soldier. The movie seemed low budget by Asian historical drama standards with not very good CGI; bland acting; not believable action scenes that seemed out of place; poor scene editing with blacked out transitions and jump about, disjointed flow; low quality English subtitling."
3,Little long for a cool story,I liked the movie alot and thought over all it was very well done. I did however find it a bit long and drawn out and thought it could have been either shorter or had a bit more action.
4,Really Beautiful,"I'm a ""kung fu"" nerd, with little to no knowledge of the culture itself, so my happiness with this product is purely based on how the storyline and cinematography was. The story was beautiful, really heartrendingly beautiful. The stunts and choreography were very exciting. I'm just now discovering Korean kung fu films and am pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoy them more than Chinese kung fu films.One thing I didn't understand, however, was the implied mystery of the title. You find out Moo Myoung's name almost immediately - how is he the sword with no name?"
5,VER WELL SATISFIED,"IM VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH THE ITEM SWORD WITH NO NAME IN THE TIME IT WAS SHIPPED AND RECEIVED. THIS MOVIE HAS MADE MY TOP BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR ALONG WITH IP MAN A LEGEND IS BORN, REIGN OF ASSASSINS, THE SORCERER AND THE WHITE SNAKE, WUXIA, AND STORM WARRIORS. IM LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING MORE BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE."
4,Cranford: The Collection,"For the deaf to watch for the first time, it was kind of boring because there was a lot of talking. But when I watched the second time and the third time, I enjoyed more and more because I understand better. They did very well acting during 1800. I am so pleased that there's subtitle in special features and I enjoyed learning of how they acts and how it made."
5,Cranford series,Bought this movie series for my wife as a Christmas present. She has enjoyed this movie series very much. Got these movies at a great price and fast safe shipping.
5,LOVE!!!!!!!! This series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OK, I'm a mushy, enduring lover of all things Victorian et all. I am also a HUGE Judy Dench fan, and she was, as always, wonderful in this. Delivery was quick, and everything about this purchase was great!"
3,It was a gift.,No feed back. It was a gift - I received not feedback.Dumb to require a set number of words in a review.
5,Days of yore,"If you like period pieces, this will certainly fill the bill! Very good acting, pleasant story line and fancy period costumes."
5,Outstanding entertainment,"Cranford transported me to a time in history where change occurred at a slower pace,providing entertaining insight into the everyday lives of village people from the era."
4,I Loved This,"These are great, entertaining visits to the Cotswolds. They are wholesome, real, and emotional portrayals of a diverse group of (mostly) women. I liked them. I rooted for them. I laughed at their antics. I thought the production was well done. After viewing it, I even put Lacock (where the outdoor scenes were filmed) on my itinerary on a trip to England. It really touched me and made me want to experience a bit of what it was like to be in Cranford (even though I know it's not real). Great entertainment at an affordable price."
5,Wonderful for British drama fans,This period drama is outstanding. Dame Judi Dench is as usual wonderful. What an amazing talent.
4,Cranford,can't rate this yet. I won't get it until tomorrow. why are you asking me to rate something I haven't gotten yet?
1,FAIL,"This DVD was nothing like that I was expecting. The total length was about 15 minutes, and there were no full clips of any ""extreme activities"" - not to mention that video quality looked like it came from a film strip projector."
2,"Cute, but...","I have to agree with some other reviewers. I just had a really hard time getting past no car seat (and riding up front!) for a 4 year old. What an awful example! I also took real issue with the idea that Cheetos and Captain Crunch are things 4 year olds should be eating.As adorable as the illustrations and part of the text are, any book where I have to change a good portion of the words when reading aloud is a big NO to me."
3,Very Babyish,I thought it would be more like I Feel Silly which it is not. Very babyish - one line sentences. I think the illustrations are not as clear as other books and looks like a mish-mash of colors. My just 5 year old is not interested in it.
3,Memoir writing,"A good memoir example to share with kids, to help them formulate their own writing about their childhood. I used this with another text to have upper-elementary students compare/contrast their likes and dislikes as well as their behavior with what they were like as a ""little"" kid. Fun pictures, and some rhythm to the language."
5,Great book,My three year old grandaughter loved this book. She asks me to read it to her daily and we both love the illustrations.
5,For my Birthday Girl,I bought this book for my daughters 4th birthday...it was perfect. She loves the book and can relate to the content. Jamie Lee Curtis has great books...I have to say that this is one of my favorites. Perfect gift for a 4 year old girl!
5,Superb Listening,"I must admit that Jerome Kern was not a familiar name to me prior to purchasing this CD. I even considered this purchase somewhat of a gamble. Not so - its quality far exceeded my expectations. The songs are great, the choral and instrumental arrangements are beautiful, and the voices are well-blending. This is already a favorite CD of mine."
2,Stick to Palastrina,"I can appreciate that the Voices of Ascension choir is attempting to encompase new and interesting repertoire which isn't usually considered choral music. However, if you are to be succesful in this, you must realize that you can't approach these different genres with the same style, tone quality, and approach that you would music from the Renaissance (for which this choir is revered). Alas, they don't succeed in this. This album totaly misses the spirit and style of these wonderfully romantic popular song standards."
2,not what i expected,"this purchase has helped me appreciate the risk in relying on product reviews: the subject material was mediocre, and the sound production very poorly suited to my needs"
1,Rubbish,"This album was awful, I couldn't tell what it was trying to achieve and frankly, I am not surprised after finding out the ""artist"" (and it pains me to use the word to describe this idiot) is nothing more than a thief."
3,More applicable to educators than business leaders,"Kohn makes some fabulaous points on what drives a child to learn at a young age, stressing the fact that rewards can cloud a child's intrinsic motivation, and natural curiosity of learning.However, I disagree with many of his arguments regarding motivation in the workplace. Basing my thoughts on past experiences I feel what he argues against really is effective."
1,Fallacies Galore,"Do yourself a huge favor and don't waste your time reading this book because it is based upon fallacies and ignoring evidence rather than on science, logic and evidence. If you want to learn what works in regard to rewards and the science of behavior then get ""The Power of Reinforcement"", by Stephen Ray Flora. Flora exposes the fallacies of ""Punished by Rewards"" as well as explaining the awesome power of reinforcement to motivate and change behavior."
1,Take with a grain of salt - a large grain of salt,"The author must be one of those 60s liberal types who thinks that anyone will perform to the highest levels because, after all, nearly everyone has only the best of intentions and is always self-motivated to do the right thing. The problem is that such a view of the world is quite unrealistic. Rewards are necessary because a large number of workers are not intrinsically motivated, no matter what we would like to believe. To believe otherwise is fighteningly naive."
4,"An excellent book, but only a partial solution","This was an excellent and very readable book. As a post-graduate teacher certification candidate in a professional development school program I've seen a number of approaches to classroom management. Most teachers, including my wife, use a combination of Mr Kohn's collaboration, content and choice, mixed with some extrinsic rewards. These rewards do not have to be expensive, and many, like pencils, are also very useful to the students. What a teacher will do in the classroom depends on the age and grade level of the students and the individual's teaching style. This book was the first really effective and well-documented presentation of the position that ""bribes"" are counter-productive."
4,Avast me hearties,"A great subject and not much covered except by Daniel Defoe 250 years ago. Good bios of the major characters. Very good explanations of the period, the hows and whys of piracy. Since piracy by its very nature is a secretive profession there isnt much in print either contemporary or historical. The author certainly has done his research, the notes and bibliography section of this book runs over 60 pages. The Madagascar pirates must have been the most successful thieves in history and the author is able to convey to us today just how much booty they managed to steal, billions in todays values. And many of them got away with it. The book is facinating yet doesnt read like a novel nor is it only a dry scholarly tome. Where able the author conveys both motivations and personalities of his characters. A very good read esp, if one is interested in the development of Madagascar."
4,Great Movie!,"The Frighteners is a great movie. Released in 1996, and directed by Peter Jackson, this movie has it all. Its funny, creepy, and has a clever and original story. Michael J. Fox, and Jeffrey Coombs of Re-Animator fame, both deliver knock out performances, as does the rest of the cast. The only downside to this movie is the effects are looking dated at this point. I can't really think of a movie to compare the Frighteners to, but if you like to laugh, and enjoy a good story, I highly recommend this one!"
3,Cute for the kids.,My daughter laughed all the way through this movie. I also found this funny. Good family entertainment.
4,"Not a massive 4 disc set, but....","No, This is not a massive 4 disc set, but the 4 hour Doc that was on the laser disc IS on the DVD, as its on the other side of the disc. I would have prefered a 2 disc set, but hey, I will take what I can get. Wont bother reviewing the movie, as many others already have. DVD-**** Movie-*****. Real Rating 4.5 Stars"
4,Ghosts,This movie is very entertaining. It's family oriented. It has all the element of a good movie. There are a lot of funny scenes as well as dramatic sceens. It has it all. The price was very fair. Mike Fox delivers and outstaning performance. Amazon is such a good place for movie deals.
4,Peter Jackson's Ghost Cocktail,"This movie seemed like a mixture of Beetlejuice, Ghost, Ghostbusters, and Psycho. I still can't make up my mind if I shall consider this a parody or if Peter Jackson was being serious. But it was fun to watch anyway!"
4,Joyful and Uplifting,I loved the movie but I found that it wasn't as heartwarming and funny as the first Lion King movie. I felt like some of the characters in the second movie didn't coincide with the original characters. It was a joyful moment to see a female lioness making her way into the new world order of lions.
2,Peter Jackson,"Before LOTR, directer Peter Jackson was known for his gross out horror films. This is one of them. Though nowhere near the offerings of Dead Alive, Bad Taste, or Meet the Feebles, this is Jackson's first attempt at going mainstream. As a horror film, it just isn't scary but it is good to see Jackson's overall film making skills blossom into a legitimate mainstream movie. Stars Michael J. Fox in the lead as a ghost buster. He was at that point finally a mainstream director, even if LOTR was an intl. flop."
3,great movie but,"This is a great movie, and the previous comment gives youthe storyline. But Im disappointed with amazon not listing aboutthe actual product. as far as whats ont he HD DVD version that's not on the already released regular DVD version. no reviews have been written about such information."
1,Unbelievably bad,I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out but remembered nothing at all about it. Now I know why. I can hardly believe that Peter Jackson made this awful mess of a movie. It fails on every level. I only paid $3 for the DVD but it wasn't even worth it at that price.
4,I need an out-of-body experience right now,"Overlooked thriller from Peter Jackson, and I believe, MJ Fox's last movie. This movie is definitely worth renting if not buying. Original, unpredictable story line, a bit convoluted here and there, but it never lets you down. The CGI effects are kinda dated as of this writing, but the comedic acting is right on target.Though the film has elements of Beetlejuice, Ghost, The 6th Sense, and Ghostbusters, it's still original in its own right. It may take you a little time to appreciate the director's vision, but when you do you'll have a good time...."
3,"Good attempt, but bad script","Fox likely made this movie to break away from his perpetual billing as the guy next door, but it is difficult to picture him as the shifty Frank Banister, and some of the dialog sounds really canned.The sequence of the film itself takes me back to my childhood when i was on some very strong anti-epileptic medication, that although legally prescribed and adminstered, produced some very bizzare and trippy visual effects. Thus, it was not particularly enjoyable to watch and the plot did not make any sense.The movie would have been good as a comedy or drama, but Fox cannot pull off horror movies as the perpetrator. Through out the movie, the usually great actor looks like he is out of his element and rethinking the decision to star in this vehicle.I like weird stuff as much as the next freak, and would normally enjoy this movie, but I can't when the lead actor himself does not look like he is having a good time during the filming."
5,A very funny look at spirits and the afterworld!,"I saw this movie in the theater years ago and I have always loved it! It is quite a thriller....fasten your seatbelt! I was laughing, crying, and screaming all at the same time. A must for any collection"
5,Great Audio and Video Quality,"Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was excellent. There was just a little very fine grain in some of the scenes - hardly noticable. Overall, fantastic video presentation. Aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and the movie lasts just over 1 hour and 45 minutes.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was also excellent. Plenty of surround sound, and a real workout for the sub-woofers.One thing - if you pause the movie, don't be gone long. I paused it for a few minutes, and the screen saver came on. I pressed ""Pause"", ""Play"", ""Forward"", ""Backward"", and could not get the movie to restart. I had to stop the movie and restart it."
4,The Frighteners,"This is like a cross between ""Ghost"" and ""Ghostbusters"". Some sligthly scary and mostly amusing parts as Michael J. Fox (Spin City, Back to the Future, Family Ties, etc.) tries to earn a living pretending to eliminate spirits from homes. He has the advantage of three spirits working for him. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, Bad Taste, etc.) was instrumental in directing, co-writing, and co-producing this movie. The movie is a rollercoaster moving almost non-stop as Fox realizes he is somehow linked to several new murders in town. The problem is a bazaar FBI agent well played by Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, DS-9, Enterprise, etc.) believes he is guilty. Meanwhile the town is going crazy with hauntings as well. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""An American Werewolf in London"" and ""Nightbreed"". - C. Luster"
3,mediocre popcorn,"I was expecting a fantastic movie here, but I was, yet again, let down. The ghosts were unfunny, but that area of the movie could have been developed into a hilarious subplot, with decent actors and better jokes. The love interest - HELLO? Why bother? She was totally unnecessary, and really pissed me of each time she was on camera. The films saving grace was Fox, and 'the baddies' who struggled to lift the film from being mediocre tosh. Never mind, watch it if you don't want to think."
3,An awesome movie ruined by a single character,"Like many of the other reviewers here, I believe that The Frighteners is a very unique and well crafted movie. Great special effects, and a great story. However, the movie is ruined by the most annoying character EVER. Whoever decided to write in the paranoid FBI agent spoiled an otherwise excellent movie. The FBI agent's character doesn't fit in with the theme of of the movie or the seriousness of the other characters. He is so annoying that repeated viewings of The Frighteners are unbearable."
5,my favorite horror movie,"the special effects remind me of the haunting, like when the ghost is in rhe wall and its shape is sticking out."
5,Fun!,"One of my favorite movies. I wanted to see it in theaters but I was only 14 at the time and couldn't convince my stepmom to take me. Ever since seeing it on VHS, I've loved the movie. The visual effects and humor (the exception of Judge humping a mummy) are great. The finale drags on a bit, but I love everything else about the movie. The great cinematography and music by Danny Elfman (and the fantastic sound design I discovered on DVD) all make for a great ride."
4,Worth watching,"The Frighteners starts off with a Ghostbusters type of atmosphere, and I think the movie would have been more successful and enjoyable if it stayed that way the whole movie instead of transition to serious horror towards the end. After all, Michael J. Fox is not the type of actor to star in a serious horror film, though his performance in the movie is excellent and probably his best. His wiseguy antics, humor, and heroism are reminiscent of his role in Back to the Future. The film should have stuck to the original formula."
5,"it's a recent ghostbuster movie, but better!!!","This as some great affects added to it to make it look the way it looks.The director makes every ghost look as real and life like as if to be really there. If you liked the Ghostbusters movie you will love this one. M.J. Fox does a great job in this movie. If you like suspense and surprise you will love this movie. You don't find out who the killer is and when you do theres another surprise. i highly recommened that who watch this movie as soon as possible because who will love it , like I have.!!!!"
5,Even Better than expected!,"This is one of our Families favorite ""Family night"" Movies (our kids are all over 17)We used to have it on VHS- but haven't seen it in YEARS, and never had the Directors cut! The additional scenes add cohesiveness to the storyline... and there were a few really funny one-liners cut from the origonal. I really recommend this to people who like dark, ghostly comedy!"
3,"MICHEAL J FOX/PETER JACKSON/COMEDY/HORROR. SURE, WHY NOT.","The reviews were very good. Fox and Jackson--what's not to like? So, I took a chance.It had it's moments. It wasn't bad, but, it wasn't as good as I anticipated. 3 1/2 stars because this movie is a little bit better than OK. I will post 3 stars.For a good PETER JACKSON movie, I will recommend DEAD ALIVE. That movie is some MAJOR COMEDY/HORROR (VERY GRAPHIC FLESH EATING ZOMBIE MOVIE)."
1,A Disaster on HD DVD,"If you wonder why you never heard of it in the theaters, wonder no more.What a flop...If you must buy, get it on Regular DVD and save your cash."
1,UGH,WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MICHAEL J FOX'S MIND WHEN HEAGREED TO DO SUCH A TERRIBLE PIECE OF GARBAGE AS THIS ?DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PILE OF YOU KNOW WHAT.
1,total disapointment,"I was really disapointed by this movie made by my favorite director Peter Jackson. I was wondering how anyone could possible like this movie it is dumd and ridiculeos, there is no way Peter Jackson made this."
4,Silver (and Gold) Nuggets,"I bought this CD at one of Burgess' concerts (in Virginia). He plays with much strength, variety of technique, and tonal quality; moreover, he has excellent command of the rhythm required for this mainly Latin American collection. My favorites are the hypnotically delightful ""Seis por Derecho"" and ""La Misionera,"" which has a driving and catchy rhythm. I find almost every other piece enjoyable except for the over-recorded ""Leyenda"" and the somewhat ponderous piece by Rodrigo (whom I'm still a big fan of, nonetheless). It would be nice if those two were replaced by a few of the other interesting Brazilian pieces I heard at the concert. Fortunately, I was told that Burgess might put out more Brazilian recordings later in 2002. I'm very much looking forward to hearing them."
1,Not complete,"Yes you get the gauge but you do not get the probe and thermal coupler, as the price states a $50+ savings from $173 it should come complete if it is showing a savings from list price so now I either by a probe kit and spend more money than buying a complete gauge that comes with everything."
1,Misleading but it's my fault.,"Amazon has a way of making products stand out with price savings and what not. After looking at tons of gauges I settled on this one not realizing it didn't come with a probe. My other choice was 20 dollars more but it had a probe. I was careless and ""accidently"" purchased this. Oh well"
3,Solid but Generic,"There is very little to take issue with in this book-- but if you didn't know the title you might just as well think you were reading a book on Amazons, Greys, or any number of other parrots. The information is extremely generic with the exception of a few passages here and there. I really don't think this is the author's fault- and the info is useful- but if you want a really good feeling for what it's like to own a QUAKER- you should also buy Mattie Sue Athan's outstanding book. That said, the one thing I do object to here is this author's claim that any household with cats and Quakers should have the cats declawed. That may be fair to the birds but is an incredible injustice to the felines. If you can't keep them separate, you might be better off not having one or the other. Overall, a solid book but if I didn't already have a Quaker this book would not have shown me how amazing these birds are! They are incredible."
5,THE QUAKER PARROT AN OWNER'S GUIDE TO A HAPPY HEALTHY PET,MUCH NEEDED INFO FOR A NEW PARROT OWNER OR A SEASONED PERSON THAT NEVER OWNED A GREAT QUAKER PARROT! THEY ARE AWESOME!
3,Basic Info,"The Quaker Parrot: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy PetThis is good introductory info if you don't already own a Quaker and don't know anything abour parrots, but I strongly disagree with her method of ""potty training"". I feel this technique could have very dire consequences. I own a Quaker and found this book lacks the discription of these amazing birds, and the information is too basic for me. So, if you already own a Quaker or other parrot, I suggest you read ""Guide To The Quaker Parrot"", by Mattie Sue Athan."
1,Not Worth the Money,"This books attempts to give some basic information on Congas and some of the other latin or ethnic percussion instruments. What you get is maybe 10-20 pages of instruction with not much text. Hand-drawn images of a poor quality of some mechanics and a lot of random drawings of instruments even most percussionists have never heard of. This is not even worth $10, much less the astronomical costs that the resellers on Amazon are asking. Save your money and find a much better put together text that is modern with good quality text and illustrations."
3,SOCIAL D BECOMING SOCIAL D,"LET ME START BY SAYING I AM A HUGE SOCIAL DISTORTION FAN, I LOVE EVERYTHING BY THEM BUT I MUST SAY THIS RECORD IS RATHER WEAK FOR SOCIAL DISTORTION, YET ONE OF THEIR MOST IMPORTANT, WHY? BECAUSE ITS WHEN THEY BEGAN TRANSFORMING TO THE BAND THEY ARE TODAY. IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE KEY ALBUMS LIKE ""SOCIAL DISTORTION"" ""SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL"" OR MY PERSONAL FAVORITE ""SEX, LOVE AND ROCK 'N' ROLL"" I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS ONE TO SOME ONE NEW TO SOCIAL D, TRY ONE OF THE RECORDS I MENTIONED FIRST."
2,The Classic Second Album? I don't Think So!,"I had heard so much hype about Prison Bound over the years so when I finaly picked up a copy I was hyped up! Ready to rock out to another storming Social D record(after only hearing Mommy.. and Mainliner). You Shoulda' seen the look on my face when it started playing :( Yeah kinda like that except angrier. The album opens with a watered down re-recording of It's The Law. Mike Ness even changed some of his own lyrics so that their just dumb. ANYWAY'S,besides a good version of the Stones Backstreet Girl I no longer listen to this album. If you like Punk or anything close to it than this album will leave you with 'cold feelings'. Buy Mommy's Little Monster or Mainliner instead for some rock n roll the right way."
3,"Not bad, but not their best","This was the first Social Distortion album I bought and I must admit, I was expecting it to be different. I love Mike Ness's voice and the songs were totally cool but if you're gonna buy one Social D. album, this isn't the best. Try Social Distortion, I liked that one better."
2,"OK, for the price",Dated graphics and no updates make for a low-price game. You get what you pay for.
3,it could have been better,"i played mortyr 1 and it was fun , i liked the graphics . mortyr 2 is not as fun , but it is more realistic , the game play is repetive , but the enemy AI is better than most games .i like to run and gun , it is harder to do in this game because even on easy you have so many enemies shooting at you . i think that for alot of the shooters i have been playing lately that the easy mode should be easy . i like to play through a game on easy setting , than after i am familer with the controls and game play , go back and play it on a more diffcult setting . having played this game . i would buy call of duty instead ."
1,A very boring game,"First off, I'll say something good about the game.The graphics are pretty good and the story line is okay.Istalling took a while but I got a chance to eat lunch while I watched it install.After getting it installed and seeing what looked like a great game getting started by the graphics,everything went downhill immediently.I had a decent graphic card but the movement was jerky.Worst of all were the constant hints telling me what to do and where to go.Large blue arrows pointing to where Ishould walk and bright yellow exclamation marks over the enemies heads.Duh!All that was missing were nametags .I like to figure things out when I'm in a game and not be led around like a dumb idiot."
2,"Oink, oink","This is a resource-hogging sow of a game, a gluttonous bottomless pit waiting to consume your PC. I can only assume the developers must have set up each of their effects to run on a different server. ""You want fog? Sure, pal, that'll take another gig of RAM."" It's unimaginable how a game of only above average graphical detail can completely disable perfectly good computers, while better looking games run smoothly.And let's not mention the sound effects, hit detection, AI, storyline, on and on. The only value this thing has is as a learning tool of how not to make games. Which would be like buying a Yugo to learn how not to make cars. Which you wouldn't do. So don't."
4,"excellent moments, well-conceived.","this (apparently) final release by mocket finds them steadily creeping more to the ""b-52s on crack"" sound of the need, who contribute heavily on this album, yet manages to remain separate through the instrumentation and style of audrey marrs and matt steinke. has some fine moments, a few songs that can be annoying, but overall a worthwhile listen. look out for: monitress, spot-for-best-vision, bone crusher, magic and ecstasy, and flyspeck."
