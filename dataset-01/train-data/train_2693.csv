5,Great gift,I bought this for my fiance 3 years ago & we still use it in the bathroom for music while taking a bath..love it
5,Coby CX144 Portable AM/FM cassette player/recorder built in mic.,"I needed a cassette recorder with specific qualities the most important being one with a built in mic. This product was exactly what I wanted. The sound quality is excellent, the choice of cd or cassette is an extra bonus. This particular type of player is a hard to find item. Thanks to Amazon for helping me find the product of my choice. I would highly recommend this player for all your needs. It does not eat tapes by the way. It is built to last. Very well priced and delivered in tact."
1,Not received,"Since we never received the above item, we cannot give a review. However, Etronics launched a search and eventually found the item was not delivered to the right home. We are awaiting a full refund on this purchase since it was returned to them and we had to purchase the item from another source."
5,Thanks,"In present time, the all electronics are; CD or DVD. There are not any more radio tape recorder or/and plate recorder.Even in cars there are CD, .....There are so many people who still are looking for old a good...electronics...tape recorder and plate musics.."
4,Good buy for the price,"This unit plays and sounds really good, was surprised at the reception from far away stations. Would recommend it just for the cassette player."
1,Cassette broke down after 4 months.,"The unit was small enough however, cassette broke down after 4 months. This doesn't last. What kind of warranty does it has?"
5,Our Great Giants of the Past,"The book is very well done with lots of pictures and information. A true tribute to our unsung Giants of the Past. Most stand in fields or yards, unnoticed, broken down and/or grown over...showing both signs of age and of neglect. Yet, with a little TLC they could once again be productive... capable of producing a mesmerizing effect on the soul or energy if needed. They actually serve a multitude of purposes if only people would take the time to care for them, they would give plenty back in return. They are our only remaining Giants of the Past and they deserve our respect and acknowledgement. This book does just that and, hopefully, it will make its readers take notice of these great Giants and their needs and many uses. They were meant to serve us and would once again if only we'd let them."
4,Practical Book,This is one of the good books on Relationship Management. Its very easy to understand and practical.
4,Quick,"These wipes are good for in between thorough cleaning. They're fast and work well in a pinch, but not a product to use in place of ordinary bathroom cleaning. They're perfect for spot cleaning every now and then."
5,Love these,"I know, disposable bad, but these are just so great! I use them for the toilet seat and the rim of the bowl and my hands don't feel all dried out from touching them. Plus, I try to use one once a night after I brush my teeth to keep the faucet/ sink/ counter fresh. It really helps between full cleanings where I do the whole scrub brush thing, and the counters don't get so dusty."
4,like them,"these smell nice. they do a good job of cleaning & I like that you can flush them... I feel like I use a lot of them though because they sort of start to fall apart as you go (I guess that's good though, means they are breaking down in the sewer quickly, right?).will buy again."
2,good effort...still crap,"There were some things to like with ""By The Devil's Hand: The 666 Killer"" but it just didn't do it for me. The actors were pretty good but the film had a homemade, shot in 3 days look to it. I was also expecting some gore. Nope, nothing. Pass on this one unless you are a friend of one of the actors. When will these no budget, want-to-be directors realize that not every shot needs to be a close-up."
3,Smaller than I expected,"I purchased this to replace the shift knob on my Honda Fit. The simplicity of this design appealed to me, and I like the leather.There is very little English on the packaging, and there are no instructions in English. I ended up surfing online to find other pictures/instructions, and was able to install this without trouble. It's much smaller than I expected but it does the job."
2,its ehh,"I was doing some interior modifications to my altima and decided to try an alternative shifter..well I chose to try this neat looking razo and honestly i wasn't very satisfied. The size isn't the problem, I actually liked it, but the way it installs kinda bothered me. The instructions are pretty clear except for one step where it looks like your supposed to take some kind of goop or gum looking junk out of the knob iuno wut that was about..anyway I followed the instructions and I had it on there twisted to almost max..I just wasn't satisfied having it loose as it was..so I tightened it as much as I could and I ended up screwing up the adapter. That wasnt the knobs fault, but I wasn't happy with its ""not wanting to tighten upness""..plus the part that looks like metal that screws onto the adapter is a horrible quality plastic. Might make someone with delicate hands happy but not me."
5,Perfect!,I've been in search for that perfect knob shifter for my Mini. The search stopped here.Solid construction. Great feel.I owned two metal ones prior to this and wish I never did. No worry for scratches. Looks great with the interior. You can't beat the price.
2,Not very durable,"I've owned this for about a year and used it for 4 camping trips (two nights per each).In the last trip, when my daughter tried to turn it on in the middle of the night, the rotary switch shaft that connects the rotary knob (the black thing at the top of the unit in the picture) and the actual switch inside the unit broke off. No light any more. Poor material (or maybe a defective unit).Any camping product should be more durable, even if the standard for ""durable"" has been declining constantly these days.The reason I give it two stars instead of one is because pack-away feature was nice, and it was bright, before it was broken."
1,Broke on first use,"I thought this would be a great latern for inside a tent. The first time I pulled the top up to use it, all four of the connections on the inside which hold the top to the bottom, broke. I sent it back and got a refund. Not worth the cost of shipping."
1,What a piece of trash,It fell apart the first time we tried to close it. They got four screws going into straw like pieces of plastic. Let me say it again PLASTIC!! When you try to open it the upper part does not slide nice like a quality product and it rips out the plastic pieces and it's broken. Coleman should be ashamed.
4,Coleman Lantern,great little lantern - very simple and easy to use... i like the on / off switch...i would recommend this for everybody to keep on hand for power outages...
2,Bowdlerizes the Bothie,"If you are thinking of setting an edition of Clough's poetry for your Victorian poetry class, then you will find that this one is the only volume that is readily available. This Routledge/Fyfield edition, however, needs to be used with caution. Shirley Chew has decided--for reasons best known to herself--to omit section V of The Bothie. Moreover, she has cut out quite a number of other lines. The notes are by no means as thorough as they should be."
5,Haunting and mesmerizing,"I bought this on impulse, I was searching for Ian Anderson and this popped up, Ian does a guest flute piece in one of the selections. This is an excellent work, Blaclmore and vocalist Candace Knight have taken traditional ""midieval mood music and gypsie melodies"", added some modern instruments, and vovals that can bring tears to your eyes. Check out ""Magical World"" If that does not bring out emotion you are probably dead already. Plus their version of ""Greensleeves"" is the most beautiful playing of that traditional song I have ever heard."
5,Blackmores Night The Whole Catalog,"Anyone who loves the old rock and roll of the past will know Deep Purple's long line of work. One of the main reasons why this band took off to the top of the rock world is having one of the greatest guitar players in the world transmitting his perfect notes to our ears. Without question Ritchie Blackmore is of the elite and after he finally departed from Deep Purple he went on to produced and create some of the best music on earth. You can't go wrong when purchasing any of the 4 releases by Blackmore's night, this is top notch music and takes you to places you thought you have been, until now! Blackmore comes full circle in his career with this classical-reniassance and mystical music from a long time ago. After a few minutes listening to this amazing music you will be hooked. If your ears have grown up you will for sure love every minute of it. Candice Night's voice will be the best you have ever heard."
4,It seems to work fine,And it seems to be in decent shape. Unfortunately I didn't read the description well enough and it simply won't do what I thought it would do.I can't hold this against the seller or the product though - It's my own dumb fault.At least I didn't spend a whole lot!
3,Pretty informative,"This is a great book if you are looking for solid info on this topic, this is a wonderful that is informative and you will not regret purchasing it!!!"
2,just not that good,"Yes, this is my first book by this author, and probably my last. I don't think she even knows a petunia from a marigold. The garden descriptions were so vague and useless as to make me wonder if she ever saw any of these gardens at all. The plot was convoluted and the whodunit aspects were fairly obvious. All in all a boring read during some long flights and waits in airports."
3,A little disappointed,"The cover caught me, the title was right down my alley, the setting was just what I like, and the cincher was the quotes, ""a good fireside read"" and ""if you can't see the gardens of England yourself, you can with this book"" (paraphrased). I HAD to read this! The book was enjoyable and the characters fun, but the story was lacking seriousness and at times disjointed. I wanted to finish because I did want to travel through England and ""see"" the gardens and also to see whodunit. My expectation of a dramatic climax is where my disappointment comes in. I was not totally unhappy with the book but the ending was not what I expected."
2,Review of little cars,I really can't share my opinion because I will have to wait to give these little cars to him in a year. Didn't know or didn't pay attention to how small they are. My grandson is just turning 1 and these cars are too small for him.
5,As good as any Squeeze record!,"To all you Squeeze fans, I can assure you that Glenn Tilbrook does not suffer artistically without the lyrics of his longtime partner Chris Difford. This is a fantastic record. My two favorite songs are the motownish ""This is where you ain't"" and the power pop sounds of ""Parallel World."" There is also a rather strange recollection of a radio interview set to music ""Interviewing Randy Newman."" Very cool stuff. Buy it!"
2,Tilbrook needs Difford,"This just does not make it. Glenn Tilbrook is an immensely talented musician with an incredible voice, but something is missing. The combination of Difford and Tilbrook is unbeatable and this album is missing that spark. Their eponymous, non-Squeeze album from 1984 (sadly out of print I think) stays in heavy rotation on my stereo some 16+ years later. Their talent together is timeless. This is just boring, and at times downright bad. Good thing that ""Interviewing Randy Newman"" is near the end or I may not have even listened that far. That song may be the worst ever to pass through my speakers. So disapointed."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"These mini loaf pans are exactly what I was looking for! I need to make smaller portions these days, for everything. I can freeze the extra for future use!"
1,Rusted the first day!,"As soon as I got my pans I washed them in the dishwasher - as it states ont the label they are dishwasher safe. As soon as I pulled the pans out of the dishwasher, rusted water started dripping from underneath the rim. Horrible!"
3,My bad,"Whoops! I didn't realize these were non-stick until after they'd been opened. Haven't used them and don't plan on using them. But they look nice, so I'm sure they'll be great for you if you don't mind the nonstick thing."
2,Yep they rust!,These work wonderfully but oh the rust! The folded pocket corners rust upon first use so there's no way to use them without parchment or foil (which both work fine). Frustrating to say the least but they still are functional.
1,Rusts after the first wash,"I shouldn't have overlooked someone's review on rust issue with these pans. Rust started appearing from corners right after the first initial recommended wash. Sorry, Chicago Metallic. but your product is a health hazard."
3,Bad design,The size is great but the design is horrible. The corners are folded over so they catch and hold water when they are washed. It makes them very hard to dry and reuse right away.
5,These are just right,"At first , I thought the pans would be too small, but they will accomodate a full recipe of yeast bread with nice rounded tops that fit in plastic bags for storage. The problem with baking bread in the 9"" pans is that it is hard to find bags for storage."
3,Nice Size Pan--challenging to clean,I love the size of these pans. Perfect for a gift for a live alone senior or for a couple. As noted in previous reviews it is challenging to get into the corners. I ended up soaking them and also tried the dishwasher which worked the best AFTER soaking. Breads remove easily from pans. Will continue to use them frequently.
5,Hard to find!!!,Someone is missing the boat in this market... a girls/woman's poker set!!!Bought 3 and the best gift at every party!
4,dsl/usb modem,"the equipment worked great. installed and set up easily. very satisfied with the product. difficult to find because we needed a modem, not a router, with usb capability. worked very well with our server and intranet. unfortunately, in our small town dsl sucks major but still the unit was worth the investment.ADSL2/2 USB Ethernet Modem"
1,Does not work with AT&T,"Spent a full day trying to make this modem work with AT&T service. After many phone calls to AT&T and D-Link as well as on-line chats, I could not get a connection to the AT&T network. AT&T blamed D-Link. D-Link blamed AT&T. Stalemate. Had to return product."
1,service,"This is still not working customer service is terrible. They claim I aneed to download a driver, but could not tell me the name of the driver.. You would think the drivers would come on the CD.. The OS is XPJohn F"
4,it works; typical modem,"I had one that lasted two years. I would label the dlink 2320 a typical cheap consumer dsl modem. As a general measurement, modems usually last about one year with me. I know my modem is dying when it starts re-syncing every ten minutes during heavy downloads/uploads. I like to strip my modems naked. Right away I take it out of it's cheap plastic case and hang it in mid air in front of a fan. It wouldn't last a month if left in it's plastic hot-box.Depending on how you need to configure the device as required by your ISP and depending on your level of experience on networking/modems and perhaps depending on how timid you are, it could take ten minutes to go from opening your box to streaming your stupid videos on the internet.You'll need to ask your ISP for settings. There are no typical settings."
2,Worked half way,"This item did not work with my ISP, Hawaiian Tel. The Wizard seemed to pick up the right settings, but it was not receiving an IP address. Hawaiian Tel was unwilling to help me figure out what I needed to tweak on the modem to fix the problem. I ultimately had to return the modem and go back to Westell modem provided me.FYI: The Westell Modem provided to me by my ISP has a complicated firewall syntax, which is the reason I bought the Dlink modem."
1,"If you run Apple Wi-FI at home, don't bother...","I have spent hours messing with this machine, trying to get it to work in Bridge Mode with my Apple Airport Extreme and Express wi-fi network at home, and so far it's been a bust. And the circa 2007 interface/firmware doesn't make it any easier. I've owned D-Link products before, and been happy with them, but this is probably the last time I try to save a few bucks by buying 5-years-old refurbished technology...working on a return as we speak."
2,I couldn't get it to work with Qwest DSL.,"My review title says it all -- I couldn't get this modem to work with Qwest DSL. I'm a proficient computer user, and I made the switch from Comcast cable to Qwest DSL when I moved. I got all the necessary settings from Qwest to do a self-install, but I simply could not get this modem to connect.I ended up buying one of the Qwest-supported Actiontec DSL modems for about the same price. (Now I'm connected, obviously.)"
5,Easy Installation for the Tech at Heart,Very simple to install despite the wizard being unable to set me up automatically. Good thing I knew how to configure these. I saw an immediate improvement with the communication to my D-Link DIR-615 Wireless Router versus the Motorola Modem given by AT&T. At least I am getting the maximun bandwidth from AT&T for the service we had signed up for. If you want more bandwidth you would need to contact your local ISP or WISP to upgrade your services.
3,Check with your provider first!!!,"You'll need to be able to access your provider's VCI/VCP, if you can't get that you're out of luck. I am also stuck with a modem I can't return, but does me no good."
4,Modem does NOT default to bridge mode,"If you're installing this modem with a router and you plug its ethernet cable into the WAN port of the router, be advised that you have to log into the router and switch it to bridge mode. Just call D-link tech support if you need help. My DSL provider was absolutely useless and repeatedly provided the wrong information. A 5 min operation turned into hours because they just kept insisting that it it always in bridge mode."
2,"""Customer Service"" What's that?",Called customer service. Automated service with NO help! Hard to find the number on the website...this product will be discontinued and there will be no more help for it...hard to find service-provider that uses this modem...ATT has difficulties with D-Link products...
1,Truly awful - wait for something better,"I got this book because it was the only one on the market. The writing is confusing, awkward, and full of useless analogies. The style is so strained it seems that if this book were written about tying your shoes it would be 200 pages with lots of commentary about how nice brown shoes are compared to lettuce. You'd be a lot better off downloading the Infobus specification from the Sun website."
1,Wow! An amazing example of how NOT to write an IT book.,"If this was an example of how not to write a book this would be an excellent book. It might be a book about the InfoBus, but any information that might be useful to the reader is buried in a morass of unreadable prose. I suggest other prospective readers wait for someone to do a better job."
1,A shockingly bad publication from Wiley,"This is just about the worst IT book I've ever had the misfortune to purchase.If you stripped out the tortuous ramblings and technically inaccurate formulations then you'd end up with less what javadoc provides - and even that would have typos in it.Based on previous experiences with Wiley, I didn't hesitate to buy ""Connecting JavaBeans..."". In future I'll take far more care."
2,"Maybe useful content, a very difficult read","I spent more than a half hour reading this book in a book store to see if I could get anything useful out of it. I didn't. I agree with the other reviewers who describe the author's writing style as ""stream-of-consciousness"". I would call it both tortuous and torturous at best. The editor really failed on this job.If you are the type who can only learn from reading code and lots of examples, and you are willing to wade through impenetrable prose, then this book could be for you. If you are looking for detailed, easy to access information then forget it. Most will do better with the Infobus specification, which you can download from Sun. I learned substantially more in 10 minutes reading the Infobus spec than I did from this book. So I left the book in the store for the next unsuspecting soul."
1,This book was a hoax,"I can't believe so many Christians were duped by this. The guy wasn't a real rabbi. He forged his rabbinical ""certification""."
1,This book was a hoax,"This guy was never a real rabbi. He forged his rabbinical ""certification"". I'm suprised so many Christians were duped by this fool."
5,Good Replacement at low price,"Used this for a 67 impala 2 door. I used this for not only the trunk seal but to replace the roof to window seals on doors, was not a perfect fit(for the doors) but with a little glue it works great for only spending under $20."
1,Greatly Lacking,This signal produced by this transmitter was too weak to produce quality sound. I had experienced better quality from an off-brand transmitter that used two AAA batteries. I am now using a Monster Mobile RadioPlay 300 and am thrilled with it.
2,XtremeMac FM Transmitter for iPod Nano Xtreeme Disappointment,"I've tried this transmitter in three different car radio systems. There is more static that music.You can set any frequency desired but it isn't powerful enough for the radio to pick up the signal.The design is such, you must remove it from any nano protection tooDon't purchase this. You'll regret it too. If you really want it. I'll sell you mine.gap"
2,Just Acceptable......but nothing more!,"Having tried several FM transmitting products, I discovered the Xtreme Mac APN-10 Airplay Boost is only a marginal performer. This technology is never going to be great, but it's difficult to rate this product as ""good"". The design is clever, however the external antenna feels cheap & flimsy. The design matched the asthetics of the ipod nano very well. There is literally no setup. Just snap it onto the bottom of your ipod and it's ready to use. My transmitter arrived with one of the 3 navigational buttons not functioning, and I suspect quality control may be an issue with this device. Obtaining warranty service for this product is cost prohibitive. Most customers would opt to purchase another unit rather than jumping through the hoops to have it repaired."
5,Rock Jazz and a few other things,"folks that don't get the jazz and other influences (jazz greats Alphonso Johnson and Billy Cobham on bass and drums) won't get this album. It's not classic rock and it's not Weir's usual stuff. this is much more a group thing inlcuding Weir rather than a backup for Weir. Very intersting in itts own right, although the debut album (bobby & the Midnites) might be just a taste sweeter."
1,An Orwellian nightmare,"1984 was the perfect year for this album: ""War is Peace"" ""Freedom is Slavery"" ""Garbage is Music"". I'm surprised hearing this album didn't kill Jerry on the spot. I actually like the first Midnites album - it's cheese, but it's honest cheese. This is cheese made from the toxic waste of early to mid-eighties rock, when the corporations said, ""We're your only access to music - take it or leave it."" Well, all music fans, not just deadheads, left this one in the Hefty bag it came in. You can't even find it for sale on the Dead's own website, they know how awful it is.This is the type of album one makes to get out of a contract. Seriously, if you can listen to a song like ""Lifeguard"" and think it's good music, you should just download a whole bunch of Menudo onto your iPod, set it for endless repeat, put the earbuds on and never take them off. Real music will just hurt you."
1,Terrible!,"Bob Weir and assorted session hacks get together and produce a real turkey stuffed with generic 80's rock. Forget the name players - this is truly dreck, and easily the worst album ever recorded by a member of the Grateful Dead.Don't waste your $$$."
1,terrible,This has to be one of the worst albums of all times. Complete junk. Makes me not want to listen to music.
1,"oh, the disillusionment","So, yes, I was starry eyed and naive to an embarrassing extent, a young deadhead who though Jerry, Bob and Co. could do no wrong. I listened to scratchy, poorly recorded tapes of mediocre shows, not to mention the ridiculous production on some of those late '70's Dead albums, and could hear no wrong. And then...this--in a nutshell, everything awful about the '80's that I was trying to escape by getting into the Dead in the first place, but worse. Dan Hartman and Rick Springfield seriously rocked compared to this dreck. Buy a copy only if really desperate to see just how bad it can get."
3,Too Much Eighties,"While the band's freshman effort was a bouncy, fun-filled romp through the musical influences of Weir and his cohorts, this album seemed to be chasing the hit-radio crowd too vigorously. Properly marketed, it may have been a hit on 1980's radio, but there was no such effort and Deadheads (as well as Weir's solo project enthusiasts) would find this a bit tedious."
3,A Joyous Celebration of the 'Decade that Taste forgot',"...just don' t take it too seriously. it' s the kind of record Zappa or 10cc could have recorded under false pretenses, just for a bit of fun. Hilarious concept when you think about it: a group of stellar musicians with the best credentials in the business get together and record an album full '80s Miami Vice - inspired Cheese-Rock, with results that can be tragic or hilarious depending on your point of view. I would not spend too much money on it, but my $2.00 mint vinyl copy from the cheapies bin is worth every penny! 3 Stars from me."
1,I Love It!,"It's so bad, it's good! Check out ""I want to live in America"" on Youtube. Surely they did this album as a joke. Billy Cobham, probably the greatest living drummer, doing this kind of stuff?FunnY!"
5,Wish I had read this 20 years ago,"When I entered college I was told I was an underachiever. It wasn't until I read Kenneth Christian's book that I understood exactly what that meant in my life and was given some tools for change. This book is clear, well-written, and, for me, highly motivating. What is more, it feels right on target."
3,Good but a bit unfocused and unrealistic,"I have mixed feelings about this book. While it attempts to define and treat something she defines as SLHPPs (Self Limiting High Potential Persons), the fact is this symptom rarely occurs in isolation. Instead it is often a primary or secondary symptom of a far more severe malady such as low-grade depression, borderline personality disorder, psychopathy, or sociopathy. Therefore the treatment plan offered by the author, though effective in principal, will prove difficult, frustrating, and ultimately ineffectual for most people exhibiting issues with commitment, fear of change, consistency, relationships, or work.The reason this gets 3 stars is for the numerous vignettes of people suffering from underachievement."
3,Gift for someone who needed to read it!,He has a 'new look' on his face so maybe my stepson is reading it. He is already more helpful around the house.
5,The final push,"Maria Frazier,I was the epitomy of underacheivement. I spent my childhood in child and sexual abuse and then my adulthoos in domestic violence. I never was able to achieve anything but negative energy. Recently I read a book titled 'Nightmares Echo'- this story delves in to the mind of the child that has dealt with abuse and her rise above it. The courage and determination and self healing is miraculous. But, still I needed something more. 'Your Own Worst Enemy' was given to me by a friend that had read it. At last I have found that something more. The final push to heal to move on and to succeed in my life. Not with money mind you, but with myself!!! This insprational book is just what the Doctor ordered so to speak. (...)"
5,Decorative Votive Cups,I was very pleased the the quality of the votives and the fast delivery. Thansk you!
2,Arrived DOA,"Bought this when it went on Amazon's gold box for $59.99. Didn't use it until last week, just past the return deadline. By the time I pay to ship it to California, my deal won't be quite as good. Oh well. This is a big rice cooker. If you are only cooking for 2, it may be too big. It may go to charity when/if I actually receive the replacement from Sanyo's headquarters."
5,Love it!,"Before I had a very simple rice cooker, you put the rice in & turned it on. Then I did a little research & got this rice cooker. The difference is amazing! This cooks my rice perfect everytime. I would highly recommend this product."
2,I used it for 1.5 year,"I bought and used this product for 1.5 years. Has been benefited from various reviews of the various product of amazon, here I am trying to write down my feeling about the product based on my 1.5 usage.cons:1. when cook porridge, often the water runs out. so the cooker looks messy after sometime's usage2. like the non-stick pan, the external skin get off."
2,"Wow, pricey","While it certainly looks neat, the $30 rice cooker I got at the Chinese grocery store does the job just as well. Tho mine doesn't have a slow cooker function. Since I bought it to cook rice, this doesn't bother me :) I cook mostly Nishiki brand brown rice in it, and so long as you put in enough water it always comes out beautifully, as does white and jasmine.So...I would say ""nifty!"", but then I would say ""wow, pricetacular!!!"""
1,The Titanium may cause liver cancer,"I bought this item at amazon.com and then I google the harmfulness of the Titanium, I found in the experiment to the mice, the Titanium may cause the mice to get liver cancer or lymphoma cancer, although there is no result to suggest the effect to patient. So I will return this product and hope there are more comments from specialist. We all know the Titanium is a good stuff to connect bones but this does not mean it can be eaten."
4,So slow,"It cooks rice, like it's supposed to, but it takes so much longer than my cheap-o 15-dollar rice cooker. Brown rice takes at least an hour and a half, and it has a nasty habit of producing some crispies. It might be that I haven't hit the magic ratio of rice-to-water for this machine (been using it sporadically for about two months now). For the most part, though, it's still pretty handy, and most of the rice is fine."
4,Good cooker,"In almost each aspect, it is a good cooker. The only thing I am not satisfied is that it makes me wait longer than my older one."
4,good product,"Good product. We used it to cook white rice and rice soup, haven't tried other options, we do like the white rice it cooks, my husband esp. likes it, saying the rice tastes much better than those cooked by our old rice cooker."
5,Greatest thing since sliced bread,This cooker is great for cooking rice and steaming veggies. Easy clean up and the food tastes great.
5,Very happy about this purchase,"Generally, as the tittle says.One thing to remind: The timer won't work within one hour and 10 minutes frame,which actually is the cooking time needed.In other words, the time setting on the timer is the time you want the rice done and ready to serve---not the time when the cooking should start.I almost have mine replaced before reading more carefully the menu,which prints in a small letter at the bottom of the page,so easy to be ignored."
2,It's too slow to cook!,"I bought this one one month ago, because I moved to another place, I just use it three times , but it's too slow to cook rice, it will take one hour, my old one just took less than 30minutes."
2,Ran for four years,This rice cooker ran for four years without any problems until now. The control panel went completely unresponsive while the time can still be adjusted when plugged in. Contacted customer support and was asked to ship in for repair. I saw a few other reviewer here had similar problem without easy fix. Decided to trash it and not buy from this brand anymore.
3,stop working after 4 years,"When it's working, it's nice with all the features.Then the nonstick coating starts to peel off after 1 year. Before the end of the 4th year, it's completely dead.I guess it is designed to be disposable. My next rice cooker is not going to be sanyo again."
5,Great Tasting Rice Every Time.,"This cooker cooks delicious tasting rice all the time. It also comes with a steaming basket for your veges, a thoughtful accessory. You can use porridge cycle for your steel cut oats but I now use myZojirushi NP-HBC18 10-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer with Induction Heating System, Stainless Steelfor this purpose. I cook mostly ""Southern Wild Blend"" (mixture of brown, wild and red rice and occasional brown rice in my Sanyo ECJ-D100S. The inner cooking pot is out of this world and it makes me wonder why all the so-called ""non-stick"" pots are not made of similar material. You cannot go wrong with this cooker. Sanyo now makes induction models too but 10 cup versions are not yet available for sale in the US."
3,It's okay,"Takes longer than expected to cook rice, compared to the one we bought a few years ago at half of the price."
4,Very nice cooker,"This thing makes rice like a dream. You put it in like the instructions say and voila, perfect rice. I haven't tried brown yet, but everything else has come out perfect, the rice that is. The 'cereal' mode isn't so perfect. I tried timed cooking both normal, natural grits and steel cut oatmeal (groats) in the machine. Each time they were edible but the grits were lumpy until I stirred them quite a bit. Same for the groats but they recovered more quickly. I think perhaps the more starchy the grains the more the final dish needs stirring to prevent clumping. This device simply isn't equipped to do that and so, it can only get so good. But for rice... perfect!"
4,Good but Slow,"I agree with the many positive comments on this cooker. However, the cooking time is extremely long. It takes 45-60 minutes to cook even plain rice. Even on the 'Quick' setting it takes 30 minutes.This is in comparrison to the $29 off brand cooker that we just replaced that made excellent rice in 20 minutes.The extra-thick pot is nice, but not as thick as the advertising on the package led me to believe.This is the first time I have had a hinged outer lid with a removeable inner lid. The innder lid fits on with a silicone gasket, and I worry that over time the gasket will wear out. When opened, hot steam from the inner lid pools around the hinge area, so you have to blot it up with a paper towel before you move the unit.Overall an excellent unit, if you plan a little bit of extra time for cooking."
3,Good Rice Cooker...for about 2 years,"I found that it was pretty easy to use, and it was always consistent. Its also pretty easy to clean because of the Teflon coating. What was kind of annoying about this cooker was the spring loaded top, which, if you were to press the button to pop the lid, would fling the lid back at a good 50 mph. Unfortunately the cooker broke 2 years after I bought it with the keypad being completely unresponsive. If I could go back in time I would have just spent a bit more for a zojirushi, my brother has one thats still running great after 12 years."
5,i like it,"its clean. the rice comes out nice. the cord rolls up inside and that's a plus. while its steaming water doesn't spit out of the top like on other models. i like that the pot isn't teflon, but titanium. the cooker's weight seems lighter than other rice cookers i've had."
4,Great model. But has Non-stick,"This was an excellent rice cooker. Easy to use. Cooked great rice, etc. And even looked great on the counter. The one BIG DOWNSIDE though is the non-stick surface; especially for something that is in contact with the food for so long.While it doesn't claim ""Teflon"" or ""Analon"" or whatever else, the bottom line is that there IS a nonstick coating on/in the cooking bowl. If you're fine with that, then it's a great unit. Otherwise you're best looking at something else.I'm not going to go into the health concerns.. The evidence against non-stick coatings is out there if you look.Would love if they had a high-quality STAINLESS STEEL version of this. And by that I mean STAINLESS STEEL BOWL WITH NO COATING. I would pay a bit more as the unit itself is perfect for my needs."
1,Rice cooker or chemical factory?,"Don't get me wrong but I have been satisfied in the past with Sanyo/Fisher products. The reason I bought this rice cooker was because of the great features it had. When I got it and used it the first time I couldn't believe the chemical smell that came from the steam of the rice cooker which smelled up my whole kitchen like a chemical plant. I was wondering if the chemicals used in the manufacture of this product might be dangerous(I'm amazed reading the reviews of other people who bought this product that no one mention this)? I thought it might go away if I made rice in it everyday for a week. But the smell never did go away and I couldn't tolerate it anymore so it HAD to be returned. I have had rice cookers from Panasonic, National, Zojirushi, Tiger which never had this problem. I think I will stick with Panasonic rice cookers. I wonder if Sanyo has corrected this problem?"
5,Try his first book,"If you haven't seen Harry Carmean's first book you are missing out! The painting's and drawing's are breath taking. I guess it is out of print and they should reprint more for you are losing out not having this book on your coffee table or library. I'm his daughter from his last marriage and proud of it. I wish I could share more with the art world, only that he is one of a kind and the only one ""Master Painter"" alive to date. Peace Helen-Margaret Carmean (LOVE YOU DAD)"
1,Won't get you anywhere....,"This book is so broad and generalized it sounds like its written by a call-in psychic. The author barely touches on a handful of businesses, then fills the rest of the book with self-promotional material. As for there being 203 business, he lists them at the back of the book, one line each!Nicholas Fry"
1,He's interested in only helping one person....himself,"This book is one long,continuous run-on sentence of mindless self promotion by Tyler Hicks. He oversimplifies and broadly brushes with ideas and techniques that are not filled out. In addition, he takes every opportunity imaginable to plug the 50 or so other books,kits,tapes he sells, giving his address nearly EVERY time. I kept reading to find some reedeming value, but alas, could not."
1,Not Good!,This book along with a couple other that I have read by this author is mostly a advertisement for his other bad books. He does not give any meaningful details and directions. He merely gives comments about how nice it is to be wealthy. The author is a stiff.
2,"Some useful info, but nothing that really interested me.","The title of this book should be ""how to turn your passion into a home-based business"". It is written more for people who already have a general idea what they want to do but need a motivational speaker to get them going. There is some good motivational speak and some general ideas but if you want to find what specific home-based business is best for you this is probably not the book to buy. The author seems more interested in selling newsletters and publications than giving practical advice."
2,I've bought your book - now stop selling at me!!,"One or two tentative ideas hidden amongst 342 pages of adverts for more of his products. Every time I came across another ""plug"" for one of his ""kits"" or ""handbooks"", I believed less and less in what he had to say.Sort of like the literary equivalent of the door-to-door insurance salesman!If you could get past the adverts, then there is some value in the ideas and motivational messages."
5,The only source for real business opportunities,"Ty Hicks writes books that are pre-sale materials for his other more detailed products. They are intended to show the wealth seeker the possibilities. Many of the reviewers that critized the Hicks materials probably paid thousands for an education that has not made wealthy other wise they would not have looked at this book. Specialized knowledge is what Hicks is selling. The ""kits"" provide the details. They are larger and more expensive and would be marketable in a book store. The newsletter has real info on loan sources. Hicks does actually answer his phone and will answer your questions. There are no other books in a book store that will give everything needed to actually run a business and learn the business. Even my other favorite, Robert Kiosaki, doesn't tell what to do in any of the Rich Dad books. So get over it and get off you rear and stop read these books and start doing business."
2,Not very helpful,This book did not offer much useful (practical) information or idea. A lot of time he's only selling his own stuff.
2,Inflator,This product is okay and I know very little about these. The one thing I did not like was that I had to plug it in in the car to work.
4,"Quick, relatively quiet and organized","For the price, this thing is great. I use the compressor for track days to adjust tire pressure in the car before going on track. It pushes air fast. It is relatively quiet compared to the other ones we have used in the paddock. Having a carrying case might actually allow this one to survive our abuse. It only gets 4 stars because the gauge isn't accurate, BUT it is relative. So if I know I need to add 4 lbs, I can get close enough watching the gauge then use a real gauge to confirm.It gets a bonus for being able to have deflate button to let pressure out, instead of unhooking the main connection.The light is cheesy but useful for when that road side problem happens and you have none. It is only 3 LEDs, so don't plan on lighting up an area with it. To remove it, you need batteries, which I will never have in it. At least there is a light I can plug in if I do need something in the pitch dark."
4,Breathless Passion,Found this book while vacationing. Quick read and could not put it down. Great story. I'm looking to read other Emilie Rose books to see if they are as good as this one. Enjoy!
5,Great book filled with words of wisdom,I had Jane Merrill sign this book for me when I bought it in 1990 and it's one I use often. Great nutrition advice as well as wonderful recipes. I have found her whole wheat bread recipes and tips especially helpful. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle!
3,Good recipes,"My daughter has this book and wanted me to get one. I don't have the time as I work to make many of the recipes. The old standard is there don't eat white sugar, flour, or simple refind foods."
3,So so photography of a beautiful subject,Idaho is one of our scenic treasures. This book doesn't really do it justice. There is something lacking in many of the photos and I wonder if it isn't in the printing. A lot of the photos lack 'pop'. I would like to compare the book to the originals. It is a nice collection of images from around the state giving you an idea of the variety of scenery available in Idaho.
1,Tired candied violets,They were old and no longer the bright color they should have been.Very over priced for the quality delivered
5,So Glad I Bought This,"This is a great DVD. The primary feature is the concert, which alone, would be worth the price, but in addition it also includes three promo videos (Love Letter, AS I Sat Sadly By Her Side, and Fifteen Feet Of Pure White Snow), and a documentary on the recording sessions for And No More Shall We Part, which most cave fans that I've met agree is their best record.I had never seen Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds live. Wasn't sure what I was in for.Nick Cave is a rock star. He is so alive and animated on stage. He stomps and swaggers with the charisma of a mad man.If you're into Nick Cave, there's no question: you need this DVD."
1,TERRIBLE Sound quality,"Okay, First off, Nick Cave gets 6 stars for his performance on this DVD. He is an amazingly energetic showman, and an incredible songwriter.That said, the audio quality for this concert footage is AWFUL. I was wondering if I got the same DVD as the other people who reviewed it, because nobody has even mentioned it. I know I'm not just being fussy, I own a decent collection of live concerts from various artists and this is by far the worst sound quality I've ever heard. Especially on the vocals, which is unforgiveable. You can tell what it should sound like beneath the muttled wall of noise and distortion, but unfortunately it doesn't do justice to the performance.The video's on this DVD in addition to the documentary, ended up making it worth it, but be aware, the concert audio is really bad!!"
1,If you like wildfires this is the stove for you!,"I bought one of these for a 2 month camping trip in the high desert of Colorado. What I got instead was a fire and the chance to use my fire extinguisher! It worked fine for the first couple of weeks, then one day when I was using it, it caught on fire as I was heating some water.An absolute piece of junk! Coleman used to stand for quality, now it stands for Chinese made junk. I wouldn't even wish something this dangerous on my ex-wife!"
1,Colman Powerhouse 414 Dual Fuel,"First time I used this stove it had a yellow flame on the primary burner even after burning for five or ten minutes. With both burners on it gave our a blue flame and worked properly but as soon as I turned the second burner off the yellow flame was back, now all my cookware is now black. I had problems with the fuel tank mounting on the side, it would not fit properly. With the lever in the up position for lighting I also had problems with gas pooling in the primary burner causing a lot of flame when it did light. Very Dangerious! Bottom line is I would not recommend this stove to anyone which is a shame since Colman used to be and was the best. I have finally settled on a proprane stove having given up on the dual fuel."
4,The old work horse,"I still haven't used it with regular gas,and to tell the truth,I'm kind of scared of the prospect,but I believe a company like Coleman wouldn't market it for regular unleaded gas if its not the real thing. I have used it with the Coleman gas and this stove will put on heat that will make your kitchen stove look like a toy. Super effective and economical as for gas consumption although Coleman gas is super expensive. One thing for sure this stove once you get the hang of it ,cooking even in harsh environment is cinch. The last Coleman stove I had was this same model,and with the regular maintanence and repair it lasted me well over 30 years and it still going-the steel gauge on my old one is thicker,the new one seems thinner."
5,Awesome Stove,"If you're looking for a camping stove that you can use even when you run out of white gas, this is the stove for you. It can be used with unleaded gasoline as well as white gas. This stove is a large one. It boils water very quickly."
3,Not like the old ones?,"I bought this product because my friends from Canada brought one with them when they came to Australia 8 years ago. But I'm not sure this new model is as good as the one they had. This one seems to have thinner metal, and is flimsy and not well made. It still lights and cooks well, but I'm just not sure these new ones are as good as the old ones. I'll have to find someone with an old one and compare. The lid and wind covers bend very easily, and the lid catch isn't quite straight. The tap for the second burner is very loose and feels really cheap and like it's about to fall out. I'm going to install a small axle bearing to make it feel better. I'm also going to install a clip to hold the tank from rattling when in transport. EVERYTHING rattles when in transport. I now put a small towel inbetween all the pieces to stop the rattling. The addition of an electronic igniter would make this product a lot better too."
1,Much Worse Than Expected,"I just removed my new Coleman stove from the box and I cannot believe what I am seeing. This has to be one of the worst constructed products I have ever seen! I am having a hard time determining whether the case is actually made out of steel because I have never seen steel this flimsy. The stove arrived with several dents in the case and the latch is bent at a 45 degree angle. This stove may be very capable of kicking out some serious heat, but I will not own it long enough to experience it for myself. Coleman should A) use better materials and B) raise the price of the stove or C)Seriously consider discontinuing these stoves because the quality is absolutely horrible."
1,a disappointment,"I've owned and operated Coleman products for over 50 years..since my old two burner stove ws beginning to show its age I ordered this new powerful stove. What arrived was a tinny poorly constructed stove that I never even tried to operate it. Although it may have worked fine its cheesy constuction turned me off completely.. the cover did'nt really close tight since the hasp was off kilter, it did'nt sit levelly but wobbled, the cheap dark green exterior finish would look well used after several uses of the stove...the burners were nothing like the quality of older Coleman stoves...all in all a bust. Amazon came through with a no questions asked refund which was the best part of the deal. Take care of your old stoves, get spare parts before you need them and you'll be better off. R.E.Moses"
4,Diver's Bible to the Maldives,"If you are a scuba diver or plan to snorkel in the Maldives, do yourself a favour and get hold of this masterpiece. The book is loaded with species not found in other books and the best I have seen on the Maldives. The photos are excellent and are as you will observe them underwater. Some may consider this dull, but it is really the way you will see them. The colour idex is extremely helpfull and will be of great benefit in you search for the fish you just saw ! Another unique feature is the fact that for most species the author has included photos of the juvenile and females to assist in identification. The layout is somewhat compressed and could have been more clear and uncluttered. The common names are not always the preferred or most common ones, but the scientific names are always correct. Enjoy the Maldives ... it is a great place to be !"
3,Well it's better than Roxio at least it doesn't destroy 2000,I picked this up after having a terrible experience with Roxio.Its better but you have to download the updates before using the software. The neroMix sucks and the visualization application doesn't work when you click on the button to make it work it says on but nothing happens. I uninstalled this off my computer.Basically a lot of software out there add in a bunch of other software instead of focusing on what they do well ie burrning software or viedo stuff etc...........
1,Support Sucks - Stay Far Away,"I sent them an email with a support question and it took almost a week one time and the other time I'm still waiting (3+ weeks). Call me stupid, but I even called them once and was ripped off to the tune of $1.29 minute. Nothing like buying it all over again!! I ditched this piece of trash and now have Roxio Easy Media Creator 7 and it works great and their support for the one time I needed it is far better - received an email response in a day."
1,"Poor Support, Conflicts and Slowness Plaque Nero","I purchased Nero 6 Ultra Edition with high hopes. Unfortunately the software has many application conflicts running on Windows 2000 (current service pack), inablity of InCD to format or erase CD-RWs, and suffers from poor technical support.Nero support's attempts to help me were good at first. They even sent me software to help resolve the conflicts with applications and direct writing to my my Plextor CD-R drive. Unfortunately even the software they sent to assist me didn't operate as they indicated it would. After a few back and forths, Nero support essentially threw up their hands and gave up.So I removed Nero 6 Ultra and installed Roxio Easy CD Creator. Now not only are my conflicts gone, but Windows Explorer file copies to CD-RWs have gone from six minutes (Nero 6 Ultra) to 30 seconds (Roxio Easy CD Creator).Nero can fiddle all they want, but I will stay out of Rome!"
2,still lacking,"For people who like to make audio mixes:The crossfade feature for burning audio CDs could be much better like in Easy CD Creator, it doesn't have many options or settings and doesn't have a preview option so it's all guess work, and the Nero SoundTrax program (which seems to have more crossfade options) doesn't appear to extract digital audio from CDs which would be nice rather than having to extract it with the basic burning program and save it as wav files, then open soundtrax and build a compilation. Would like to have one audio burning program that doees it all. Maybe I will give Easy CD Creator 6 a try, though people don't seem very happy with it either..."
2,Not as good as Roxio Creator 7,I found DVD compatibilty issues with Nero during playback that Creator 7 did not have. There are also a lot more features and an easier user interface in Creator 7.
2,Serious problems in purchased version of product,"Nero 6 immediately crashed my extremely stable Windows XP (Service Patch 1) system right after installing it. That system had no other CD/DVD software on it, and thus no conflicting software. I had to go to the Nero web site and download over 40 MBs!! of their ""updates"". It then has worked fine (so far) and actually looks to be quite good. Nero clearly rushed this product out to compete against the new version 6 of easy CD and DVD Creator. If you purchase this product be sure to get all of the ""updates"" from the Nero site before trying to do anything at all, including just browsing the menus."
1,The WORST customer service ever,"I am getting the dreaded ""error:6"" message as well. My email to Nero has been ignored and I WILL NOT pay $1.29 a minute to help AHEAD debug their poorly written software. BTW - has anybody received a solution from AHEAD?I switched to NERO from EZCD Creator because of Roxio's buggy software but now I am in the market for a new CD burning product. Why can't these companies get it right or at least provide decent tech support?"
1,Review of Roxio and Nero,"Unfortunately, Nero (Ahead software), unlike Roxio, is still a company lacking business maturity. Nero does not have a phone number listed on their website, and after calling directory assistance for a phone number, the number just rings to an answering machine. Like many immature dot com companies in the 90's, Nero has insulated themselves and their Brand from any personal contact with the public other then email. This is the forewarning of a company already in trouble.Roxio has their 800 number posted right on their website, and they answered the phone right away. I quickly had my questions answered, and they were incredible helpful and professional. Roxio has business maturity, and is positioned to be around for years to come. My recommendation is to go with the professional company, Roxio."
1,No photo show NO responce,I bought Nero Ultra to make photo shows to watch on TV and send to our family. Have tried all types of media and no luck. Emailed teck support twice and still no responce. I wouldn't recommend this type service to my worst enemy.
1,Would not install!,"I tried repeatedly to get Nero 6 Ultra Edition to install onmy WindowsXP system, but each time I got the following errormessage ""An error occurred during the copy process (filename: ).Error: 6 Please reboot and try again."" I even tried returningthe software to the store I got it from (Fry's) for an exchange,but the replacement did the same thing. Fortunately, they'llgive me store credit for what is obviously a defective productFor what it's worth, I emailed their tech support department with the problem.I've also read about problems with thesoftware accepting legitimate serial numbers. For now, I wouldrecommend sticking with Nero 5, and not upgrading yet."
2,Nero purchase was wrong,"This was not the correct, full version and would not do what I wanted. The seller refunded without a problem."
1,Look Carefully At What You Order - Deceptive,"I mistakenly thought because the title of this page was Nero 6 Ultra, that I would only be offered that product. So, I was lured by the low prices of what I thought was the product I was looking for. I paid a little over six bucks (including shipping) for Nero 6 OEM. Now I've got two copies. My bad, but it is a mistake that is easy to make. So, be careful with your order.Anyone want Nero 6 OEM ... cheap?"
5,Great product. Nero shines again.,"Don't know what to say about this latest version of Nero except that it delivers. It's everything in one- cdr burning, dvdr burning, a great media player in neromix, a great dvd player in nero showtime, and a more than adequate wave file editor. And there's more in this latest version that those features. Unlike version 5, this new version 6 has everything included in this one package. I have Windows XP and it installed fine so the other reviewers must have some isolated problems perhaps. If you've used Nero before the interface is practically the same except for a bit of updating and a more modern, rounded look to it. Other than that, if you used Nero before you'll be burning your next cd a couple minutes after installation."
1,Burning In Hell,"I used the Nero 5.5 demo version for quite a while and liked it enough to buy the new Nero 6. Big mistake! So many things that worked fine on the previous version are messed up. A short list:Wave Editor cannot split files correctly and often can't even open the files it creates.Twain Scanning no longer works in the cover designerBuring rom file selector incorrectly renames songsMany, Many menu items and controls with no help or documentation.Etc, Etc.Nero 6 has been out just amonth or so and already there have been 2 major bug fixes ( ahead calls them updates)I have tried reinstalling and updating, but the bugs I am finding are with the program and not system problems. Email to Nero brings no response. In short save your money, or try to find a copy of nero 5.5 at least it works."
2,Wait until at least June before you buy!,"I recieved this product with a Sony DVD RW DRU-710a burner for Christmas. I have all the updates installed on my computer for Windows and for Nero, and I also use Windows XP. So far I've had tremendous problems with this software. It often won't eject CDs after it burns them (they keep spinning), which means you have to shut down your computer by cutting off the power. I really, really, really don't like doing that, but it's the only way to do it as Windows can't properly shut down while this program is failing like this. The customer support guys are very friendly and very swamped with issues so be prepared to wait about a week or so before you can have your issues resolved. The idea behind the program is excellent. However, you would be wise to wait six months until they get the bugs worked out."
2,Simple fix for installation problems,"I just bought Nero 6 Ultra retail and tryed to install it on my Windows XP system. The installation would always fail loading a different file and tell me to Restart Windows and begin Installation again. I'm dumb. I optimized my hard drive and restarted 10 times. I'm stupid. I paid $1.29 a minute to call Tech support. The serial number faintly (dox matrix) printed on the CD sleeve looked like it had letters and numbers. The only letter was the ""A"". I clearly saw a ""B"" but it was really an ""8"" and the ""D"" was really a ""0"". Be sure to fill in the company box even if you only say home and be sure you type in the hyphens when you enter the serial number. I'm miffed the program would not tell me my problem was the serial number. I'm now ready for the program to prove its worth to me."
5,Important Book,"This is a very important read for those interested in American culture, American myth, and the construction of American identity. Wuthnow's use of immigrants is so key, because so much of the American mythos is invisible to Americans that simply blindly consume it, having less ""formally"" learned it."
4,"Quick, and Direct... some errors","This book was a really quick and easy book to go through, although it would have been nice if there were more than just 2 practice tests. Also, there were only about 3 errors that I found, which is a really low number compared to others I'lve gone through. The techniques vary in wording between the other books, but the ideas are pretty much the same. This is probably the fastest book to get ready for the PSATs, although it would be nicer if it had more practice tests."
4,Egypt Primer,National Geographic - Into the Great Pyramid/Egypt - Quest for Eternity (2-pack)A very good primer for those planning a trip to Egypt.
2,is bitter true,these poems do offer the reader something to think about and in time she can find her voice but it is not in these pages yet this book needed a strong hand clearly in the editing stages that it clearly did not get and yes there is personal insight offer by the poems but at times rhey seem bitter a little to bitter for my cup of tea
4,Darius Milhaud,A must for piano lovers. Very well recorded. Warm sound. Musically a strong and inspiring interpretation of Mr. Milhaud's finest compositions for two pianos.
1,Waste,The screw on the battery dept was stripped...could not even unscrew it! Poor quality. Over the top packaging (a million twist ties with screws!
1,Piece of junk,Great if you only want it to work about 5 times. Now it just turns back and forth and no bubbles come out. Little Tikes doesn't carry it any longer (thank goodness) so hopefully consumers will be able to throw away their money on something else.
1,Terrible.,"I don't ususally write reviews, but will for this. Terrible product, when you extend the drawers fully the weight of the cabinet shifts making it so that the whole thing topples over onto you. The description states ""hand painted"" but the front facia exhibits dried paint drips. The thing is essentially a badly painted wooden box."
5,Solid Book on WIN32 Threading,This is a very focused book. I found it a good companion book to other Windows programming books. It doesn't try to go into areas outside of it's scope like discussing MFC programming or C++ programming. If you want to know about threads and how to program using the WIn32 threading model then get this book.
3,Only Windows 95 and NT ???,"Quite useful book. But I wont recommend it. Other than file I/O and threading, it is not for advanced programmers.From the beginning to end, it only imparts about Win95 and WinNT. None of the OS after Windows 98 are covered. So, much of information covered is obsolete.I was looking to a complete multithreading book for Windows XP, COM threading models, writing perfect multithreaded GUI application."
5,Excellent! A must have!,"Using the example source, I built a server that handles as many requests as I can throw at it."
2,Entry level Win32 multithreading book,I bought this book in 2005. This is a good book for beginners. I would expect more advanced topics and more complex multithreading techniques.
3,Not the best,"I bought this book to get advanced concepts of win32 multithreading which I cant get by browsing through msdn. Although this book has covered all topics, I was expecting more like a ""Concurrent Programming In Java, by Doug Lee"" kind of book which has a lot of gotchas. I would recommend this book for beginners looking for examples of how to use the APIs. Advanced developers should look somewhere else."
3,"Interesting, but not too much information","When I heard about this Elder and the fact that he lived to be 125 years old, I was quite intrigued to read about his life and the kind of asceticism he must have practiced. While there is certainly a lot of this in there, the book also covers Elder Melchizidek's interactions with other monastics of the day. It seems to me that most of the information about Elder Melchizedek was recorded from sources talking about other Elders, Monks, Ascetics, etc. That's not to say that this book isn't interesting, its just not all that I had hoped it to be. The book does warm the heart though, especially when one reads of the 95 year old monk going to live in solitude...especially when that meant that he had another 30 years to live! It is good to see that his biography/life is available although not a lot is known (the book is a mere 70 pages, forwards and indexes included.)...the book is definately worth reading."
4,for msb fans,this is really for true msb fans. there are a number of new version of old songs. all the favorites are here. a few too many covers of other peoples songs. though they are good i was more interested in his music.
5,A must have!,"Listening to this gave me goosebumps...the good kind! I've been a fan of Michael's music since the beginning of MSB. HE has a way with words, and when he puts them to music, sings the emotions, there you have it. I absolutly love this CD!"
1,Terrible!,"I can see that I am not the only one who had a bad experience with this cap. This cap is HUGE, two people could probably fit under it. It was hard to tell whether the cap got hot or not because it was so big and bulky that it never really reached my head in the first place. I will try another manufacturer. Heating caps are not that easy to find nowadays as many companies are no longer making them. Instead of this product you would be better off purcashing a soft bonnet hairdryer which fits more snugly on the head and gets a lot hotter."
1,Horrible,"I bought this heating cap sometime ago and it didn't get hot. Believe it or not, I'm still using a 15 yr old one by Kaz, which is no longer made. Avoid this brand in general. They make horrible bonnet dryers, too. I bought one by Mastex which I will break out when my Kaz dies."
1,One of the worst,"This line of study aid from princeton review called ""Cracking the...."" is one of the worst out there. There are other books to prepare for the SHSAT."
5,"A history of the Shakers, a","After viewing this beautifully mastered film by Burns et al at Florentine Films, you will never think of another task or job as a waste of time. The Shakers did not strive for producing the most things, but that each action was done to perfection. They worked as though ""Today is the last day of your life"" and they worked as though ""they had the rest of time"" to perform each and every task"". Slow your life down; watch this film!"
2,Skimpy overview of the Shakers,"The Shakers were an American religious sect that nurtured an explosion of creativity in theology, social experimentation, architecture, music, design, and invention. Never larger than a few thousand men and women, this group accomplished an amazing amount and their legacy is out of all proportion to their numbers. Ken Burns does a very superficial job here. Next to nothing is said about their radical theology: Mother Ann was seen as the second coming of Christ in female form. Ken Burns, who did such a good job with the Civil War, never mentions that the Shakers' numbers grew radically after the upheavals of the Civil War left many people seeking extreme religious lifestyles. While there are examples of Shaker music, no one discusses the unique style of their hymns. The vast Shaker thological literature that survives seems to have little interest to him. It is as if Burns spent a weekend doing research and figured that he had learned enough. He didn't."
3,"Three stars means ok, not good, lust ok","I bought this movie on a whim. It tries to present itself as a romantic comedy...sort of. What it really shows is how a possibly life threatening disease can effect a disfunctional family. You'll have to go all the way back to 1973's very entertaining ""Five On The Blackhand Side"" to find the inspiration for ""Love Relatons"". Too bad the newer movie spends a lot of time showing us the serious and not very funny or romantic relationships of the characters. Should you purchase it? Maybe. Try to catch it on tv and then decide if you should add it to your collection."
3,"Interesting life, not well written","I read this book while doing research on a novel. And it played to my interest in history and race relations, especially in Texas. Anyway, Johnson was a multi-dimensioned character who became the first black heavyweight boxing champion and dated white women when it was decidedly unusual for a black man to do so, and he was able to get away with it for a number of reasons, not the least being that he cared little for the opinions of others. His life was interesting enough that I wish his biographer had had more skill in bringing him to life."
2,Round Glass Table with chairs,"Round Glass Top Table With ChairsThe product arrived as described and would be rated as excellent except that one of the chairs has started to have dark spots all over the metal. If the company responds to this, then I will change my rating.The company did send (many months later) a replacement frame for the chair, which was really appreciated by us. The old one has gotten even creepier looking with more black spots. The other chairs are fine. Now I would say a good product for the price. I tried to increase the number of stars, but the site is not letting me edit that."
5,REAL HOT,Rasco always makes classics. This one is always in heavy rotation. DOPE hip hop music from a ill MC!
2,New Rasco?,"The new Rasco was a somewhat of a disapointment. The beats are all average; there was not really a memorable song on the whole cd, due to rasco producing most of the album himself. Not a terrible cd, but think twice about spending your money on it."
5,A simply told tale of two dogs visiting for a week,"A simple story told about the week Duncan, an Irish wolfhound, comes to visit Little Dog. The dogs are excited to see one another, have moments of jealously and at the end, Little Dog is sad when Duncan goes home. The story is told in concise, eloquent wording: ""Little Dog yips, runs in circles, runs to the door, barking -- Visitor!"" Charming watercolor illustrations detail the owner, who is a young girl, and the two dogs."
4,Puppy Love,"For most young listeners, free verse poetry instills boredom and confusion. No rhythm? No rhyme? No story? There's no such problem with Little Dog and Duncan, a charming anthology of short poems that weave together mini-episodes in the story of a friendly wolfhound who has an overnight visit with his diminutive neighbor, Little Dog.As a read aloud story, it's a delightful success. Lessons in opposites and similarities are naturally woven into each sceanario, and children can't help but enjoy recognizing human behavior in the familiar canine personalities. But it's at its best read alone when the words have an opportunity to work on a multiple planes, inviting imaginative reader analysis of the poetic form."
3,"Lucious, beautiful, gorgeous, but alas, incomprehensible","Mostly I agree with the other reviewers. If all you want is lovely sound and melodies for playing as background or mood music, you'll be delighted.However, the lyrics on virtually every track cannot be understood. Here and there a few words and phrases break through, but that's it. You won't understand anything else unless you already know the words. One of the other reviewers hits on the real problem here: BMG's cheap job on the liner notes. There aren't any. This disk really needed the lyrics.By the way, the second to last track is ""Garry Owen"", the regimental battle march of Custer's 7th Cavalry in its folk song form. You still won't understand too much of the song, but the CD may be worth it just for that track."
1,"Watch out - these are historic films, not current !","If purchasing these films, you need to be aware that these are HISTORIC and VINTAGE films. They are NOT current. They were originally made in the 1940's and 1950's in black & white. The description in Amazon is deceptive."
5,Plenty of models of familiar animals and fairytail animals!,"This is one of my favorite origami books. It contains diagrams for a rat, ox, tiger, bloar, rabbit, dog, chinese dragon, rooster, snake, monkey, ram, horse, sea serpent, unicorn, centaur, wyvern, griffin, three headed dragon, western dragon, pegasus, chimera, and cerberus."
4,It ought to be better.,"In this book, Montroll falls into routines. The chinese zodiac models are ugly enough (just compared to his beautiful models in ""Origami sculptures""),and the process of folding lacks scintillation. The second part of the book is fair, some mythological creatures are faithfully constructed."
1,I've seen better!,I was very disappointed in Montroll's origami books. the directions/diagrams were not clear or complete. i was also disappointed in the end results of the pieces. they lacked the detail despite the complicated folds that were used to achieve the finished pieces.
2,"Great performance, awefull recording!","I've bought 1200+ cds through Amazon and have only written one other review because of nostalgia. I felt inclined to write this so folks know that the quality of the recording couldn't be much worse. I have numerous recordings from the 20s and 30s that sound much better. There is a terrible amount of hissing/static on this cd.The other reviewers stated the truth and as far as the performance went they said it all, the performance was awesome but I couldn't get by the noise and couldn't enjoy the music. May be good for historical reference though? Anyway I was dissapointed that the folks who raved about this recording didn't say anything, they should have. LOL"
4,Great for beginners,Great ukulele for beginners or if you want to see if you'll like playing the ukulele. If you keep playing the ukulele I strongly suggest getting a better ukulele because its kind of flimsy.
5,Great story!!,I've seen the movie plenty of times but of course there is always more information in the book. I just had to purchase this. I can't wait to read it.
3,A must read,"This is a pretty good book - although I agree with the co-author that there probably isn't any evidence that James (Jass) Jackson fathered Queen. I think that is the sad and tragic part the ""children of the plantation"" - they were not accepted into either world and were caste out of the family and probably never mentioned around the plantation after the Civil War ended. The book ends on a happy note but I would have liked to have found out when Queen died and how close she really was to Alex Haley. The tv movie was ok - I think it glossed over and sugar coated the issue of slavery. The point of both Roots and Queen wasn't the historical aspects or accuracy (although those were interesting and important too) but a story of an American family. I think these stories are worth reading and should be discussed in schools and at home since most people want to know where they came from and what made certain life events turn them into the person they are."
1,The parts written by Alex Haley are good.,"This book is a travesty. The guy who wrote it isn't even American. He plays fast and loose with historical facts. The potato famine is in the wrong century. Napoleon invades Ireland before he even rose to power. There are at least two chapters that are totallly irrelevant. Why does he feel the need to give us a history lesson on Andrew Jackson and the Indian removal? Does he think the Indian removal and slavery are the same issue?On the other hand, the parts written by Alex Haley are exceptional. It is very easy to pick out which parts Alex Haley wrote. They are well-written and historically based. It is just such a shame that Mr. Stevens was allowed to add to Alex's work. Mr. Stevens cannot not write anything but cheap, historical romance. He should be writing for Harlequin, instead of, ruining the work of a great American writer."
4,A triumphant story of hope and glory.,"Alex Haley & Dave Stevens' QUEEN is a rare gem---the story of an american family that touches many lives. Queen is the main focus of the book but her story spans past & future generations from Ireland to America. Some of the characters are tragic but all have hope for a better tomorrow. The heartbreak of Easter's love for her ""master"", Queen being taught to read by her grandpa and the Haley family's quest to get a better education for their youngest son are just some of the heartbreaking stories in this novel. I enjoyed the book very much and I now hope to finally read ROOTS."
5,Great Book!,"One of Alex Haley's greatest works, another branch to the history of his family. At the end of the book you want to know what happened after the story ended. A great book for people who want to know more inside the life of a a mixed race slave, who faces many tragedies in her life but learns to trust and let people love her. Every time you reread the book you find something new. Exceptional even for children to read. If you loved Roots you'll absolutely love this book. And you will love the movie."
5,Excellent portrayal of african-american history,The book is a great service to the history of slavery starting for Haley Grandma in the late 1800's. This is a good study and reference to a possible side project when studying slavery in history class. His book Roots was also great I would recommend reading that even if you dont study history
3,Clannad Magical Ring Is Not Magical,For my personal taste most of the selections were disappointing - not what I expected from the Clannad group. Other recordings were more to my taste.
2,"Great Idea, Extremely poor editing","When I saw this book was offered, I immediately downloaded the preview. I looked forward to reading it and making a purchase. Throughout the entire preview there were so many errors that I deleted it from my list. Parts of the sentences had a break in them so you had to put the words together in your head and re-read may passages, the capital letter A was in between many of the spaces... etc.When they clean up this book I will attempt to read it again and perhaps buy it. The idea was great but the errors made it impossible to read."
1,Bad design?,"I ordered the pedal blocks for my four old son's bike. They were easy enough to install, but they don't work! Every time he puts his foot on the pedals, the pedal flips around. I can't figure out how to make them work properly. Since the shipping was more than the product, I guess I'm just stuck with a defective product and $10 less dollars in my wallet."
1,"Cheap, cheap, CHEAP!!","This product fell apart about 2 weeks after using it. The rubber holding the blocks together just split and it fell off. We had to use tape to keep them on, and even that didn't work. I wouldn't buy these again."
2,Would not stay on,Don't waste your money on this item. Shoddy made and the blocks slide off when using the pedals.
1,"I agree...cheap, cheap, cheap!",I had the same problem...this product fell apart about 2 weeks after using it. The rubber holding the blocks together just split and it fell off. I wouldn't buy these again either!
2,Not what I thought they'd be,"We bought these very same pedal blocks at a local bike shop for my 2 year old's mini bike he got for Easter. His little short legs could barely reach the pedals so we thought these would help. Installation was not too difficult. But I agree with other reviewers when it comes to the pedals flipping over when my son puts his feet on them. I like the idea of the rubber for traction however, I am disappointed that they really didn't help him much or make it easier for him to ride his bike. I don't think I'd recommend these to others. Fitting your child to a bike is the best way!"
4,Good item,These blocks are good for extending the pedals. The rubber stretches out so once you get them on leave them until they are no longer needed and they will stay in place.
3,Pretty good for what it is.,"Not a bad crime novel. There is very little mystery to any of it. You know who the criminals are, what they are going to do and how. The only mystery is what Jesse can do about it. Parker further deveops Jesse as a character. You get a little puzzled by the whole ex wife thing. Why doesn't he just forget about her? I am left wondering.But a readable book."
4,Good but quick read,"I have read all of Robert Parkers books and these latest ones are not his best, but still Death In Paradise kept my attention and I read it in one day. I will continue to by Parkers books but I do wish he would put a little more into them."
3,Not his Best~Not his Worst Either,"I am a great fan of Robert Parker and think he writes wonderful mysteries. This is no exception. The mystery involved is wonderful and will have you guessing all the way throught the book.I also had to admire his treatment of alcohlism in this book. While most books make drinking...even to excess... a virtue, Parker attacks the subject straight on and deals with the demons of the disease well enough to make me wonder if he has been down the road himself.The one downfall to this book is Jesse Stones inability to speak in more than 2 or 3 word sentances, much like Spenser. In fact, almost every time Stone speaks, my mind conjured up Spenser. Parker needs to work on removing himself from Spenser while writing his other works."
4,Rock solid Parker,"As disappointed as I was with Parker's GUNMAN'S RHAPSODY, I'm as equally happy with this well-done entry in the Jesse Stone series. All of the familiar Parker trademarks are here: baseball, beer, surly kids with good hearts, shrinks galore. Most important, though, is the melodic, flowing prose that Parker does so well, through so many novels.If you're a fan of his work, you should certainly enjoy this book."
4,Turn To Stone!,"I think these Jesse Stone books just keep getting better and better with each release. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and I like this one even more.I may be in the minority here, but I'm finding that I prefer Jesse Stone over Spenser."
5,My favorite books,Parker's Jesse Stone stories are among my favorites. This one is no exception. Great read. Parker's concise style makes for very easy reading. It's a shame that he recently passed away. He will be creatly missed.
4,Solid,"A solid effort, a tightly woven plot, a hero who's wrestling with his inner demons. What more could one ask for? Well, just a little more than this. I, for one (and I've said this in previous reviews of Parker's books) am totally tired of heros who love their women so much that they drive the women into the arms of other men. Let's see...Love and Glory, All my Yesterdays, Spencer (of course), the Sunny Randall novels, and now Jesse Stone. The same damn, dumb thing. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Oh, well...it's still a good book, but I really wish Parker would figure out a new schtick for his protagonists' love lives. This one is a bore."
5,Great Book,This book captivates your imagination. Holds you on the edge of your chair. The Jesse Stone character is wonderful. Hope to see more of Jesse Stone in the future.
4,"Don't take that next drink, Jesse!","Jesse Stone is a cop - and a boozer. Don't call him an alcoholic because he doesn't admit it to himself. And he's certainly not going to go to AA meetings. The mystery is so-so. Parker certainly has done better, and I expect he will again. What I enjoyed, however, was Jesse Stone's struggle with his own weakness and his slow but steady progress toward redemption. The rapid-fire dialogue sometimes plays a bit thin - maybe I've seen it too often in the Spencer novels. It makes for fast reading, but after a while it becomes an affectation, rather than an interesting way to show characters in action. Certainly this isn't the best Parker novel ever published, perhaps it might even be a bit below average, but even a less-than-average Parker is better than 99% of the rest of what's out there. Certainly worth an afternoon in the recliner with a NON-alcoholic beverage on the side table."
3,Great Character--Rehashed Plot,"Parker always writes what amounts to light entertaining works but maybe I've simply read too much of him. Stone is a great character and is a different from Spenser and Sunny Randall -- characters in his other novels. And Death in Paradise gives us more insight into what makes Stone tick -- which is the strength of the book. But the plot is a rehash of a rehash of plenty of Parker's other novels. Have I read this plot line before?? Yes, more than once.Overall entertaining, so thumbs up. But I'm ready for a new plot, a new twist, along with the new character."
1,Even by the relaxed standards of the genre...,"...this is a slight book. Uninteresting characters, predictable plot, an endless subplot about the main character trying to figure out if he has a drinking problem, passionless love interest. Parker used to be one of the best but now he's on autopilot, I fear."
2,"This is a Play, Not A Book!","Though I've been a fan of Robert Parker in the past, I don't like the direction he's going in his more recent books. Go back and look at his early stuff and then reconsider ""Death in Paradise.""This isn't a book. It's a play. It's page after page of dialogue. No chapter is longer than four pages (calling James Patterson). The formula is the same. One paragraph of text at the beginning of each chapter, followed by four pages of dialogue.how long did it take Mr. Parker to write this -- maybe a week? Perhaps another week to rewrite? And for this he gets paid? Go figure."
4,MURDER IN A SMALLTOWN,... YOU CAN PUT THIS ONE DOWN BUT YOU'LL PICK IT UP AGAIN BECAUSE THE INTEREST IN SOLVING THE CRIME IS THERE. THE MOST TRAGIC PART OF THE STORY MAY BE THE REACTION OF THE GIRL'S FAMILY. THERE IS DEEP MEANING THRU THE BOOK IF YOU STOP TO CONSIDER WHAT IS GOING ON AND DON'T JUST SKIM OVER THE PLOT. TAKE THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT TODAY'S FAMILY AND THE PROBLEMS OF AMERICA TODAY AS THE NEW CULTURAL VALUES EMERGE.
3,Verbs,"Robert B.,Whatever happened to verbs in sentences???Book is OK, but this time the movie is better."
2,"""Airport"" novel.","I loved Robert B. Parker and long ago read most of the Spencer books. Now I know why I stopped. The Spencer novels became flat and predictable, especially when it came to his private life.The frist Jesse Stone book was really quite good, unless Stone was obsessing about his ex-wife or his drinking. I skipped the second book hoping that by the third he would have kicked ex-wife to the curb. Instead we find him over-obsessing about her. The scenes between them are tiresome to the max and they come nearly every third chapter! The mystery is simple and predictable but engaging enough to read while waiting for your flight to be called."
2,Jesse Stone is a No-go,"If you want to know the truth, Robert B. Parker needs to give up on Jesse Stone as a character. Parker is one of the finest mystery writers around and his Spenser series is second to none, and I think that he needs to stick with his strength (Spenser & Hawk). This isn't a terribly bad novel, but it certainly isn't that good, either. The plot is okay but slow and even a little tedious. The conclusion is so formulaic that it is totally unsatisfactory.The main problem that I had with this book is that the characters are less than satisfactory and not entirely likeable. Jesse Stone is allegedly trying to confront his alcoholism but refuses to do anything about it. His ex-wife is a burden rather that an asset- she serves no useful function. The various minor characters are rather poorly drawn and add but little to the book.My advice is to pass on this one, particularly if you are a big fan of Spenser."
2,Ho Hum,"Jesse Stone is drinking more, sleeping around without emotion and sleep walking through a not-so-mysterious death investigation. It feels like Parker has lost the touch for a compelling plot and characters that we can care about. Something is missing."
1,Don't bother buying this BOOK!!! Borrow it from someone!!,"I enjoy a good mystery, but this book was nowhere close. The story was more about a guy that had a drinking problem and 2 different women he's sleeping with, big deal!! I've read other mystery books that had a better story line. If you want to sleep better, this book will do it!! VERY DISAPPOINTING"
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Having enjoyed all the Spenser tales, I have been hoping for something equally entertaining out of Jesse Stone. Not to be! This third novel is the worst yet. Short on mysytery and action and long on maudlin accounts of the hero's alcoholism and dysfunctional relationships. Pretty painful stuff."
1,Not worth the effort,"This was a short story, generously spaced with large print, and very disappointing. Familiar Boston characters are recycled and if you couldn't guess the ending by page 100, you fell asleep sooner than I did. Perhaps it is time for Mr. Parker to leave behind his tortured, alcohol dependant, over-sexed police chief. There is something so naturally repellant about a man that constantly pines/obsesses about his ex-wife, while lining up a series of warm bodies to replace her at the same time. I don't care if he wins his wife back; I don't care if he solves the crime; I don't care if he stops drinking and I don't care if he ever grows up. I doubt that I will purchase any more Jesse Stone books and, now that I think about it, even the last two Spenser were pretty slim in plot. I so dearly love the early Spenser books and perhaps ending my Parker reading with their memory would be best."
3,Marginally Better,"This story line was a little more plausible. Parker really is a very good storyteller, he just perpetuates such strange ideas. Like the idea that a selfish is worthy of working to keep. The ex-wife in this story is actually worse than Susan Silverman, yet the hero stubbornly refused to acknowledge her worthlessness, although he does flirt with the idea. An okay read."
2,Fast Read,Good story and fast read but too much graphic sex. I like my imagination better than all of the graphic details.
2,"Easy, fun read -- not worth spending money","I have been reading these using Overdrive to get Kindle books. They are enjoyable, but not worth the money to buy. Each ""novel"" is really just a long chapter/episode."
4,"I HAVE TWO BOOBIES, WHY ONE PER PACKAGE?","SO I PUT ONE IN MY DIAPER BAG NEEDED RELIZED IT ONLY HAD ONE IN THE PLASTIC... SO I WAS LIKE LEFTY OR RIGHTY? HMM...I HAVE TWO BOOBIES, WHY ONE PER PACKAGE? I FOUND THAT SO DUMB BUT THE PRODUCT ITS SELF IS THE BEST IVE TRYED (="
5,Thank God for this product.,"At around the 35 weeks of my pregnancy I started leaking at time so I decided I need nursing pads ( funny I thought I'd never need them). I have an abundant milk supply which is good for my baby but causes me so much trouble. I would feed him on one side while the other is leaking. After trying many brand, this is the only one that hold up. It can hold a lot of milk. I was very surprised with the product. It fit me perfectly and no more wet shirt. It is also cheaper than other product. I love it so much I bought a whole case of 6 - 6 pack boxes."
5,the best disposable nursing pad out there!,"i started using these right after i had my baby girl. I , like my mother produce a lot of milk and even while still pregnant I would leak a lot! these pads have always covered me i depend on them... even at night when the feedings are farther apart and you leak a lot more than in the day, i've filled one completely and it still held up it was really heavy and i didnt leak!! best ever!!!"
3,Word of caution for busty moms.,"Overall advice: don't buy a large quantity of any nursing pad until you find one you really like.Specific advice: If you started your pregancy with large breasts (DD and up before baby) I believe that you might prefer the supermarket-available GERBER brand pads to these. The curvature of the Lansinoh pads presumes a medium or large (but not huge) breast. This made the pads more noticeable under clothing. These pads are very absorbent, and do effectively prevent leakage."
5,best pad ever,I am a first time mother and I had tried several kinds of pad before I found Lansinoh disposable nursing pads. This is the BEST!!! Swear to God. Don't even bother to try others.
5,Great,These nursing pads are great. I really have to pad it to find out whether it's wet or not. Feels completely dry and is very thin. I recommend these.
2,Don't like the gel,"These are like little diapers. They are filled with gel that gets heavy like a diaper when you leak. I am a heavy leaker and while these would protect my clothes, they got heavy, awkward and uncomfortable when they got full. I am going to try other brands. One plus, they are thinner than the johnsons."
3,Not as nice and comfortable as the 'ultra-soft' ones,"I was originally using theLansinoh Ultra Soft Disposable Nursing Pads 36 eabut bought these thinking they were less expensive. But after doing some quick math, they cost the same per unit when purchased from my local baby store.These are more scratchy and not as comfortable as the ultra-soft ones. These are also easier to peel out of the individual packets and easier to put into your bra because of the round shape. The ultra-soft ones have one side that sticks to the individual packaging and it's always a pain to open. They also have straight sides with only two rounded sides...so a bit awkward to put on. But ultimately, I'm sticking with the ultra-soft ones because they don't scratch against my nipples."
1,show through clothes,I was disappointed in these pads. They have a seam right down the middle that shows through your clothes. They are also individually wrapped in plastic which creates more waste. They are also not very comfortable to wear. There are other pads out there that are much more comfortable against your skin. I will not be buying these again.
4,"Fits well, absorbs well","These fit very well and are pretty thin. I've been wearing thin tshirts for the summer and usually the pads don't show through. I've never had a problem with them leaking through at all. They stay put just fine without the adhesive. My only complaint is that they get dislodged when you actually nurse, and the adhesive doesn't seem strong enough to keep them in place. So you just have to reposition them after you're done nursing."
5,Perfect,"This is what every breast feeding mom needs! No more leaking through your shirts and they work magic when you miss a feeding and are ""leaking""."
3,"Fair enough, but could be better.","I have tried a few brands, these pads are okay. It is thicker and can hold more volumn than many other brands, but the dimension is a little too small, that creates an awkward shape if you're wearing a soft bra. I find the johnson brand pads are shaped better, larger, and looking more natural, it also holds more volumn of milk."
2,These pads are too rough,"The padding is rough and irritates my nipples with a burning sensation. I found that Avent pads are much softer.Too bad I bought a whole box of them. I thought nursing pads would all be the same. Lesson learned. As a previous reviewer mentioned, try different brands out before buying a large box."
4,Loved them!,"I can understand how some people wouldn't love these...I suppose it depends on what bothers you.Breakdown:They absorb excess milk. They can get ""gelly"" but thats if you let them get too full.They didn't show under my clothes which was a problem I had with other brands that eventually sold me on Lansinoh.They have a sticker in the back that 'pretty much' works. Its not super sticky but with normal use, it should stay in place.If youre doing anything vigorous or if you use them while sleeping, they may move or fold.The ones I had (7 years ago) were each individually wrapped which meant they were always fresh and clean when I put them in.I would recommend these to most people. If your skin is sensitive, I wouldn't use these as they absorb so well that when they do bulk up, moisture can sit on your skin without you knowing."
4,Best ones I've tried,"Having tried Avent and Johnson & Johnson nursing pads, I've settled on Lansinoh:1 - Size: Avent and J&J; were a bit small on me. If you are larger-breasted (I'm a D cup), these pads are the largest ones I've found and countour well around the breast. The others come already contoured, which can be awkward if you don't fit their size.2 - Absorbency: I can go longer with Lansinoh without having to use new pads, which is not only more conventient, but more ecomonical.3 - Individually wrapped: This seemed like an annoyance at first, however, it means that it's easy to drop a couple in your purse in case you need to change into new ones while you're out.I didn't give it 5 stars because the adhesive portion is really not that great. It wears off fast and sometimes it can lead to the pad bunching up or moving a bit."
4,Best Disposable Nursing Pad I've Tried,"The Lansinoh Disposable Nursing Pads are the best I have tried. I have tried the Gerber and Medela brand.In my opinion, Gerber was the worst as it beaded up like what is in a disposable diaper and it tore easily if it passed a cetain soaking point. A bit dangerous, if you don't notice it and by some minute chance it is around the baby to swallow.Medela was a bit better, as it didn't have the beads. The liner feels more papery (but won't tear like Gerber's), but I think that affects the absorbancy.The Lansinoh brand also doesn't have that bead-effect. The liner feels more cloth like, especially when wet, and seems like it is moisturized to the touch. I have found that the Lansinoh brand absorbs more."
5,Very comfortable while being absorbant,"I had gotten these first because of the reviews. I also wound up with free samples of Medela pads. The Medela ones are no where near as comfortable and tended to irritate my nipples when they were sore early on. Also, if you are using lanolin for dryness/soreness, I found that these don't stick to the lanolin, while the Medela ones did. You will notice a slight coloring where the lanolin was touching the pad, but that's all.I've been using these for 2 months and find them extremely useful, especially at night. Occasionally side-sleeping has caused let-down and while I've woken up with the pads noticably heavy with milk, I didn't have any leaks messing up the bed at the same time."
3,"Absorbant and soft, but a bit bulky","I liked these in the winter, but now as the weather is warmer andI am wearing lighter clothes I am self conscious as the pads tend to bunch up and are visible under my clothing. Good absorbency, though. I will wear my remaining supply for overnights. I also dislike the plastic sleeves they come in...they just seem wasteful."
3,Decent for moms with huge milk supply,"I have used Curity, Gerber, Evenflo (2 kinds), washables, and these. Of them all these were the best at holding milk when I am out. But they definitely did not help during the night. During the first week or two, I didn't have much problem, even with my 3 month old daughter sleeping through the night (7-8 hours). But, after that, I kept waking up to wet sheets with them even being in place. At this point, I have to change them 2 or 3 times a night because I wake up soaked. Since I haven't found a breast pad as good for day outings, I guess I will suffer the night with these and some towels."
1,Not the best,"I bought these nursing pads because of the price and was horribly disappointed! I would definitely not recommend these, they don't absorb well so they kept me wet, and they were quite lumpy and thick. I highly recommend Medela nursing pads."
3,"Buen producto, pero no vale la pena","SaludosCompré este producto con la intención de ahorar un poco de dinero, pero con el transporte sale más barato comprarlo en su farmacia local.El producto es bueno pero no sobresaliente y definitivamente por el mismo monto se consiguen mejores en el mercado.Obviamente la que hizo la prueba fue mi esposa.Oscar Romero"
1,Not for sore nipples!,"I had a very bad experience with these pads. If you have sore nipples, these are too rough and make them hurt more. I found cotton reusable pads much more comfortable!"
1,Insane amount of plastic!,"My husband grabbed these from the supermarket in a pinch. Lined in plastic, wrapped in plastic, bundled in plastic... and yet the word ""natural"" is used in the founder's message 3 times. Ha! If the environmental aspect doesn't bother you, think about fumbling around for new pads at 4am after forgetting to ""prep"" (unwrap) them the night before. A total pain."
5,AWESOME !!,"IF YOU ARE BREAST FEEDING YOU ARE GOING TO NEED THEM. THEY ARE GREAT, THESE PADS ABSORB REALLY WELL TOO AND ARE VERY CONFORTABLE. I WILL DEF. RECOMMEND THEM."
3,"No leaks, but too hot!","I live in a place that's VERY hot in the summer (and by summer I mean May to November, sometimes longer!!). I tried the Lansinoh pads on the recommendation from a friend who said not to waste any money on any other brand of disposables. These pads don't leak, but they were much too hot. I did try another brand since I had some samples, but same thing. I would get irritated skin from being in a warm/hot moist environment! I switched to cloth nursing pads and have no problems anymore. These were better than other disposables I tried, but cloth is the best for me!"
3,Ouch!,"These pads definitely get the job done, but at a price. As other reviewers have mentioned, the adhesive on the back isn't quite strong enough to keep the pads in place. So, you occasionally end up with the corner of the pad tucked under and the adhesive bound to your skin...ouch! Otherwise, you barely even feel them there and they absorb very well. They also look a little bulky through the built-in bra of a tank top. If you are wearing a thick bra, I don't think that would be a problem."
5,Give it 10 stars...,if I could. When I first had my son the nurses in the hospital suggested different things for leakage. Some of which made it worse. I tried different brands of pads when I got home and found these to be the best by far. I was a fountain in the first couple of months and these never leaked. If I ever have another child I will go to the hospital with these in my bag.
1,Itchy,This product did not work for me. It causes my nipples to itch. I'm going to have to try another brand.
1,These are NOT the Same Pads as Before!,"These are smaller than before and are now tapered, which makes them dome shaped and creates annoying bulges in your bra cup that will show through your shirt. The old Lansinoh pads were perfection for us bigger-breasted women, but now, with the smaller size, they are just as inferior as every other brand!"
2,Mildly Interesting,"This book was a mildly interesting look at some of Philadelphia's more interesting happenings, however many of the stories were plainly boring and of little interest, and a great many were typical stories from any big city. Having lived in Philadelphia for over 20 years, there were much more interesting stories floating around.Individually, these stories were great for their original intended purpose as filler in a magazine, but as a book it is quite lacking. While it might be fun to check out of the library, I certainly wouldn't put down hard earned money to buy it."
3,A decent short documentary series.,"This and O.K. documentary series on ancient civilizations. Some are well done, and provide good descriptions of the civilizations they are about. But many only provide limited imformation on the civlizations they discuss. This not a great series of short documentaries, but is a decent one."
4,Wet pads,Wonderful product. We use them as a bed pad for my father who has had a stroke. Saves on washing sheets every day. have purchased several more since then. Thank you.
4,Big and Absorbent.,These pads are very big and absorbent.They provide excellent protection for our rug as we use them as wee-wee pads for our dogs.
3,Weak material,"They maybe a good price and size, but the material sucks! This is my first day using them and the top layer has already peeled off! Which made the other layer exposed, so when I got up a piece got stuck on my butt! I don't know if I'll be ordering these again or not."
5,Just what she needed,Good quality and absorbent pad. The larger size of this pad is ideal. My mom can sleep comfortably without worrying if it is under her properly.
2,No Christmas music here,"I too was mesmerized by these voices from the first moments of ""Elizabeth, the Virgin Queen."" I jumped at this CD hoping it would be a great holiday CD but there are only 2 songs that I had ever heard before..."
3,"Good sound, repeats some from other albums","I like the tracks on this CD but found that many of the selections are from other Baebes albums like Slava Nos. The selections do tend to sound good, lots of harmony & some selections do have interesting music, I don't get any sense of it being Christmas music though.It's a good album that I don't regret owning but I wish it had more new material and some decent liner notes. The other Mediaeval Baebes albums did a much better job of telling you about the source material and even printed out the lyrics, I wanted that here too."
4,none,"1-what is your return policy.2-how do i find out what songs are on this cd3- i can not review this cd because I do not know the songs on this cd, and can not buy this cd because you do not give a listing of the songs on this one."
4,Nice Selection of good songs,"I have to admit that I haven't purchased the CD, but I own most of them on the original albums (yes, LP's!). I really like the selection. When you go from Canned Heat to the Airplane, Grateful Dead, Bad Company, etc., you really can have a good cross section, and best of all, they are not the ones you heard 47 times last month on the Golden Oldies station. A bargain if you don't have all the old LP's (could that really be a bargain?) or simply could not find all the recordings at all! So go ahead and get it! It will be worth your hard-earned money."
4,Great Lakes History from the Ontario shores,"I enjoyed this compilation of essays which takes its cue from the happenings along the north and east shores of the Great Lakes. Chapter 3, The Revenge of the Nancy & Chapter 6 Spies and Rebels on the Lakes are two examples I especialy enjoyed. If you have a library of Great Lakes books this volume fits a niche and should be on your shelf."
5,Incredible Stuff!,"Joe Sugarman's books are an extraordinary read! I've been writing copy professionally for years, so I'm no slouch. With the information Joe shared, I've been forced to rethink my entire approach to copywriting! Discover how Joe thinks, as he takes you by the hand on a tour through his most successful ads from his now legendary, JS & A catalogue. His amazing stories will make you laugh. They'll make you cry.

4,Marketing Genius,"It isn't often that any genius will take the time to write a book that describes exactly what and how he pulled off a number of documented marketing coups. This guy did, and it makes for exciting reading that offers an insight into how he looks to find unique and appealing attributes to any marketing opportunity, and even how to uncover an opportunity that presents itself as a supplier problem or uncooperative partner. His recommended readings are on the money."
5,great quality,"This muffin pan is great quality although not what I was expecting. I thought it was the crown only, but it is the crown abnd muffin combined. Nice pan."
1,Muffin Pan,Pan was what was expected but the muffins do not come out looking like a mushroom. I was looking for a pan where the muffin top came over the muffin so you could break it off. It's hard to explain.
1,Horrible,"Horrible, to avoid absolutely. Music is not respected (tempo) and the interpreters nesont not capable to sing in the odd style"
1,Selena Vive,"I was able to see the beginning of the Selena Vive in Univision and I really loved it but I was not able to see the whole thing. I went online and saw that they were going to have the dvd I was so excited that I pre-ordered the dvd. But when I got the dvd through the mail, I was so disappointed because they only had 9 singers of the original 20 singers that performed that night. What a rip off!!!!! Do not buy this DVD, if I could return the dvd I would."
1,Rubbish,"It is not the original version of Selena Vive! concert on 7th April 2005. EMI changed the live songs, and mixed the studio and the live sounds, and put into the DVD.Don't buy it!"
1,Selena Vive dvd,"Please do not waste your money on this rubbish. If you want to hear the true Selena at her best then buy Selena Live, its still the best cd by far and the only way to remember her ."
2,Selena the best,"Hello,Como fan de Selena debo decir que no comprare el DVD porque la verdad no me gusto del todo como cantaron ciertos artistas. Prefiero no mencionar sus nombres porque no quiero ofender. Fueron muy pocos que de verdad dieron EL TODO para rendirle homenaje a Selena. Selena era y sera UNICA. ;)"
3,"good image, not to good sound","I expect that the sound was better that the last concert, because was filmed on 2005, but when you heard with a good home theater, the sound is not too good."
4,TRIBUTE TO OUR LATIN ANGEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great tribute to our beautiful beloved Selena, past and present popular latin artists re-unite together to remember a young talented fellow artist whose life was cut short, paying tribute to her by singing her songs. This DVD shows not only how much Selena's music impacted the lives of fans & fellow artists, but just how loved and talented she was, it reminds each and every one of her followers that Selena forever lives in us, in our hearts, in her music, her videos, and to the real Selena fans - she still remains much alive, still singing and dancing!!!! (...)"
4,"as good as OEM, cheaper","but I got rid of the printer years ago as it died shortly after the warranty (head got all clogged up). Bought a Canon Pixma which, so far, is going strong after 4 years. I donated the cartridges to my church. But this was a good off-brand and I recommend them."
5,One Brush Stroke At a Time,"Truly a beautiful and inspirational learning video. Johnnie Liliehahl's talents go far beyond her artistic abilities as a great artist, she also has the ability to teach others how she approaches the blank canvas. We are reminded that the entire composition can only be accomplished one brush stroke at a time and she expertly explaines these various methods with a breakdown that can easily be followed. She demonstrates her color mixing and narrates throughout the entire video so we are never at a loss as to how she achieved an effect or where she is in the execution process. Make no mistake that this is just about copying someone else's creativity - our talent as individual painters will be brought out thru color mixes along with brush stroke direction and pressure. Here we are given the tools of assistance and encouragement to create our own signature works. This is art and teaching at it's finest."
2,Not exactly one of his top recordings.,"I too am a fan of John Klemmer. But this cd doesn't hold quite a candle to his other recordings such as ""Touch, Hush and Barefoot Ballet"". As much as I love the saxophone instrument, it would've been nice to have had some other instruments involved on those tracks such as some percussions, bass guitar and a keyboard or piano if you will. I think this could've really been an super album with those involved. I know it's considered a solo saxophone album, but still, I would've liked more involved. This one will have to grow on me. If not, I'll be making a trade at the record store for something more upbeat."
1,Bad Science,"This book recommends techniques that are not scientific, just the author's opinion. You would be much better off consulting a nutritionist. Protect your health and look elsewhere for information and help."
2,Why the stereotypes?,"We love plan toys and now have several components of the plan city. I wanted a mix of people for my son to play with-- not just some white figures that look like him. It is a diverse world.But these look terrible. Why such sterotypical clothing, hair, and costumes. I am not Asian but I couldn't buy these for him. I don't understand. This is a Thai company-- am I missing something?"
1,The Bunk,"This movie was the bunk, meaning it was poop. I wanted for it to be good, I really did. The idea of a buncha soldiers going crazy on each other in a bunker is, to me, great fun - but instead it turned into a surreal, meandering series of vignettes that were only loosely connected.When the end of the movie came, I found myself completely confused. I know that confusion can sometimes be used to enhance the scares in a horror movie - one example of a movie that did that well is Jacob's Ladder. This one was just confusing for no reason. It just kinda ended with no real point.Now, maybe I'm just simple-minded, maybe I have ADD - but I found the Bunker to be about as scary as watching paint dry."
2,Good acting but otherwise a poor movie,"A bunch of German soldiers fleeing allied advancement towards the end of WW2 take refuge in a tank bunker. The main premise of the movie is that some horrific evil lies in the tunnels that lie unused beneath the bunker. Despite a promising start and very good acting, you gradually realise there is nothing at the heart of this. What seems to be occurring is largely self-destruction driven by a bad case of the ""willies"" (no idea how to spell that word). The acting is decent, but is wasted on a poor plot with inadequate atmosphere and ambiguous loose ends all over the place. After finishing the film (a chore in itself) you still feel like the key 15-30 minutes of the movie (the ones that would make it make more sense) are missing. Very poor work."
2,Not a horror movie,"The cover makes this movie appear to be a night of the living dead zombie style of flick. It is not.German soldiers take refuge in a bunker while under attack from the ""yanks"". The bunker is out of ammo and supplies. Connected to the bunker is a network of underground tunnels. Stay out of the tunnels, the local legend says they are evil. The soldiers start to loose it. The old guy says he talks to his dead son in the tunnels. Just what the heck is going on. Lots of flashbacks. Are the tunnels haunted, or are the guys just going crazy. I think it's just trapped gases from poor ventilation displacing oxygen making the soldiers looney. And that's about it. The movie is not a horror film, but rather a drama with a little bit of action thrown in."
1,The Clunker,"Despite whatever the DVD cover will lead you to believe there are no zombies or for that matter anything remotely scary in this film. What you do get is some German soldiers (with British accents) who hole up in a bunker and for the next 90 minutes argue amongst themselves until they all end up killing each other in boring ways. Obviously the only reason this is even in the horror section is the cover.Back to the British accents, why would you make a movie about German soldiers and then cast all English speaking British actors? They even said ""bloody"" like 15 times. Very distracting.Not even worth watching for free."
3,Hmm,Hmm this movie seems like I remember it from years ago I think there inside a bunker and they get attacked by dead nazis but idk for sure I think its a ok movie...
3,A bit off kilter near the end,"As another reviewer says, this film builds up well and is good as it does this. In the extras there is a Making Of piece where it is noted that the movie is really about soliders affected by the atmosphere of the bunker and reflecting on their prior acts. I rather like that it isn't a blood and gore horror film and is more psychological. I do agree it could use a bit stronger finish to what is built up, though I rather like the very end again."
1,Only if the German were like this in WWII.......,"Don't waste your time on this movie wishing that you can see a movie with all these German butts kicked real good by some ghost. You simply won't find such excitment in this movie at all.Only if the Germans were as stupid, as coward, and as mentally unstable as portraited in this movie, we wouldn't need to fight them at all 60 years ago and the French or the Jews alone could have taken care of them already. This has to be one of the worst movie portrait of WWII German soldiers of all time. Maybe the creators of this movie hated the Germans so much that they have to make all those German chacaters in this movie so stupid and coward.If you are looking for horror, this is not for you.If you are looking for a good WWII movie, go watch Saving Private Ryan again.Stay away from this crap."
3,A decent spook show.,"WW2 history has always fascinated me. I am an avid horror fan and the combination of war and horror seemed pretty cool. In my opinion this film is enjoyable to watch. It is spooky, the cast is top-notch and the overall feel the director gave the film gave me a very claustrophobic sensation. I felt uncomfortable durring the scenes of cast hysteria. The sets were tight, dimly lit and each actor gave a very realistic job portraying scarred, frantic and overzealous soldiers. There was no gore in it. This film is basically a pschological thriller. Leave it up to the imagination type of film. My one quam with this is that the soldiers portrayed are germans. The actors casted are all British. Mix British actors portraying hard core German soldiers you get a German soldier with a British ascent."
1,The genus pinus,"Useless to me. No drawings,no photos. References to figs, but I found none. And without them the text had no meaning for me."
5,The Feather in your Heart,"This is a story for children, but it is also a story for adults. The story and the storyteller transport one to another place and time, but it is also here and now. The story is mythology, but is easily translated into our own reality. The story lends itself to discussion at every level of understanding. Enjoy!"
5,Beyond the Vows,"I just finished Beyond the Vows and felt sad as I wanted it to go on forever. That is the way all of Mr. Griffin's books leave me feeling. I enjoy his writing as it is so easy to get immersed in the character's life. The insight it gives into life of a priest and the Catholic Church is most interesting. I recommend it highly and thank Mr. Ed Griffin for sharing his stories, whether fact or fiction."
5,Clannad Legend,"Anyone who likes Clannad will enjoy this work. As most people are aware who look at this item, it's the sound track for the Robin of Sherwood TV series from the 1980's."
3,Ok but not their best stuff...,"I am a big fan of Clannad and if you really liked the movie then I guess you liked the soundtrack. IMHO they have much better tracks layed down out there then you will find on this CD. It's ok, just not great."
5,Want to better understand the Cahtolic faith?,"This book is a wealth of understanding. This book it not a history of the church, nor a catechism, but comes instead from the mouths of six children who literally grew up in the presence of the Mother of God. From this book comes a deep understanding of the Christian faith. You will be so surprised after reading this how well things just make sense and you will feel such a peace in your faith!And for those who are perplexed about the Catholic denomination, Visions of the Children explains it from the bottom up, so that you can have no previous knowledge of the Catholic denomination or the Christian religion and still come away understanding a great deal. Also, for non-Catholics, there is no pressure of conversion. :-)Just take a chance on this book! You won't regret it!!!!God bless!"
5,A beautiful collection of inspirational research and interviews,"The interviews are facinating and simple. The messages are timeless and make so much perfect sense, it just blows your mind to be made aware of all this! Read this...you will not be unchanged, and you will enjoy every minute of the transformation.This book can be read in awsome little daily bites, or as a sweeping consumption of hope and wonder!I have learned so much thru the authors' well researched and sensitive approach to educating the reader as to the details of the appirations still continuing in Medjugorje. I picked up a few copies for Christmas gifts, they were received with anticipation and lots of appreciation...they don't have any idea how much yet!"
4,Let your children read it.,This is a great book. I bought my kids each 1 copy. If you try to choose this one between Queen of Angels. Take this one instead.
4,Analytical and excellent,"This book is more about questions and answers; it is extremely informative and wonderful. It's not as personal as I would have liked. I will next purchase ""Medjugorje the 90's"" for a more inspirational book which has more of people's conversion stories and personal experiences."
1,Very expensive and they don't last!,According to the box it should last as long as 8 regular bulbs. This bulb was purchases 2-2007 and quit working 3-2008. One month past the 1 year warranty!
2,Probably Best to Stay Away from this One (Cherry),"I love Lipton Green Tea to Go.....except this one. This one tastes like watered down cherry cough syrup. The only way I am able to drink it, is to mix it with the Mandarin Mango, which creates a awesome drink. But this by itself is not very good. Give the others a shot before you risk this one. Or go buy a small box first to try it."
2,Not that good,"I bought this simply on the allure of the ""cherry blossom"" flavor, but that seems to be its downfall, at least for me. It tasted terrible. The tea tasted like cherry cough syrup had been poured into it. I'm going to stick to the honey lemon flavor from now on. That one is really good. This one is not."
4,"nice flavor, but weak","I like the flavor of this product, but I was expecting it to have flavor strength similar to the bottled tea. This mix, however, is quite weak."
2,it does the job,"This replacement battery does not fit into the phone's battery compartment as well as the original - it's smaller and doesn't sit securely. The item arrived with no power and it took at least a week to charge up in the phone caddy. Shipping from Amazon was slow, however the (expensive) express shipping option was not selected. After about a month the phone finally seems to be back in proper working order. Too soon to tell about battery life."
2,Good concept but far from perfect.,"Pros:*Clip on clip;*Rotating clip;*Strong plastic;*Rubber hinge and clasp concept keeps the case as one unified piece;*Bottom iPod ports are easily accessed with the case on;*Screen protector is permanent and set in from the case, limiting scrathes;*Rubber padding on back keeps the back of the case from getting scrathed when sitting on desk or table.Cons:*Case is difficult to open and close, especially when an iPod is inside;*Case is not quite long enough. Even with lots of pushing and pressing, the bottom of my Nano extends about .25mm below the case;*There are no bottom bracings like with the Griffin iClear polycarbonate case;*Case is misshapen so that it is not a snug fit when the Nano is in the case;*Rubber cover over the clickwheel is strong but too thick so i cut it up and removed it. I put a plastic film over the clickwheel to give it some protection. That works great;*All these plexiglass type cases will eventually get scrathed up."
1,Does not fit a 2G nano,"I get the package in the mail, open it and then tried to fit my nano into the case. It does not fit! It's literally a hair too small. At first thought it might be my mistake. Possibly having a different generation nano than the one it's made for. I confirmed I have a 2G and it's the manufacturer's fault. I recommend the few that still have a 2G nano and looking for a case to avoid this one. There's one that is a silicone skin which fits fine."
3,It's alright,"I wanted a cover with a belt clip. That part of this case is awesome. The closing mechanism is a weird silicone latch, the click wheel cover is not very sensitive and the case makes getting to the hold button very hard. But the belt clip is awesome."
1,Clip broke after two weeks,"It worked pretty well for about two weeks. Then the clip broke off, and I had bought it mainly for the clip (the case seemed like a good idea too). So basically I wasted my money. The case itself is fine, although you can't adjust the volume, and it's difficult to open the case if you want to adjust the volume. I recommend not buying this."
3,Clear Ipod Case,"This Item Is great, because i was given my Ipod for my birthday with my name and a message engraved. It is pretty durable and withstand dropped and banged around. My only problem with it is that the click wheel is hard to monerver, when i try to slide my finger to turn the volume up it doesnt read the touch very well because the protectant covering is too thick. Other than that I enjoy having this case over my Ipod."
2,weak.,"Too fluffy for trance, too thumpy for pop. Remixes should -add something- to the underlying track but I can't tell that any of these are superior to the source material in any way.Goes to show that every artist can be hit-and-miss, because I thought _Pictures_ was GREAT."
3,"Nothing new, but still not bad...","I'm a huge fan of Timo Maas, so I snapped up this CD as soon as I saw it. Overall, it's not a bad CD--pure, hard-driving Timo tracks--but it's all pretty much remixes. Basically, an interesting CD, with some fresh remixes in his trademark bass-y sound, but it's not as chock-full of dizzying tracks like Music for the Maases1."
4,Great book & easy to find what you want,"Got this for my husband so he could repair is Explorer. It's a great book & came sealed & clean. He uses it all the time, writes notes in the margins, etc. It's handy! Gives correct part names & makes it easy to go into Autozone to get what you need. The photos show you where things are & how to remove/repair.Highly recommend if you own an older Ford."
4,Metal Fan 4 Ever,"I think this was Helix's finest LP.It has two of my all time favorite songs.Heavy Metal Love,and Dirty Dog(wich they didn't even play at they're concert).This is Jamming Heavy Metal before the influence of the POP side of the Industry took control and changed most bands.If you buy this one remember to Crank up Dirty Dog !!!!"
4,What a debut,"Heavy Metal Love, their first video, their first stab at the U.S. charts. This album rocks from start to finish. White Lace and Black Leather, No Rest For The Wicked, there is so much good music on this disc for the 80's metal maven. I hope their other discs get re-released soon, this is some serious power rock that needs to be brought back to the forefront of the ever drowning music world of today. Helix was a breath of fresh air and to this day noone sounds quite like them. Check this and any other Helix out. I highly reccommend it."
5,WHAT A GOOD ROCKIN' CD,"This was no debut for this group but it was what got them noticed in the USA. The first song I ever heard from them was DON'T GET MADE, GET EVEN, and boy was I hooked. The second song I had heard from these boys from the ""GREAT WHITE NORTH"" was HEAVY METAL LOVE. It even has it's ballad of NEVER WANT TO LOSE YOU. I seem to rate HELIX CD's very high as most of them are very good. I'm sure if yor a HELIX fan that you've probably already purchased this. If you're new to HELIX, then what are you waiting for, BUY IT!!!!"
1,BEWARE of weight limits! 50 lb. max.,"50 pound weight limit on this bed, I called manufacturer to confirm! An adult CAN NOT sit on this bed.We originally bought a ""convertible"" crib (converts from crib to day bed) with the thought of using the day bed feature as a toddler bed, only to find out later the crib and day bed weight limit is 100 lbs. It would be pretty hard to keep adults from sitting on the bed to read a book or cuddle. I started looking at toddler beds, and the weight limit is even lower! What is the point? 50 pounds is ridiculous."
2,careful of sharp corners,Be VERY careful of sharp corners on the headboard and footboard on this bed! I have numerous bruises on my leg from walking too close. Recently my 2 year old got a nice cut behind his ear from playing near the bed. Just last night my 4 year old cut her cheek and needed 3 stitches!No matter how we arrange the bed in the room the head or foot board stick out.
4,great bed for a great price,My son has been using this bed for a year now and we are quite happy with it. It did take two people to put it together because some of the slats were slightly warped and you really had to work to fit everything in the slots... but once it was together is was super sturdy and no complaints here. My DS jumps on it all the time and both him and his sister like to play on it. As for the PP complaining about the weight limit... that is pretty much true of all toddler beds (and crib mattresses) and really shouldn't be held against this bed in particular. I sit along side the bed while reading or singing to DS and have never had a problem. Good bed for the price.
1,"good product, but the left side without bracket",the product is good and fit perfectly to my nissan sentra 2002 mexican madebut the left side came without the bracket.why ??????????? very bad
3,Excellent performance - but faulty recording,"This CD brings us a true superproduction of excellent Russian liturgical music, exquisitely performed by a large choir of men and boys. But unfortunately many of the louder passages are plagued by severe overload distortion which detracts quite a lot from the listening joy. Without this technical flaw, this album would have earned 5 stars."
2,Not worth spending the money on,"I bought this book as I had been asked to look in into the implementation of an Intranet. I have used Cold Fusion in the past for smaller projects and thought this book might point me in the right direction. It's poor points were (in no particular order!) NO index, lack of CF 3.0 specific code, VERY poor examples on the CD-ROM, including one missing database. If they did upgrades on books this one is in desperate need of one"
2,No 3.0 in Cold Fusion 3.0,"Money. This was probably the motivating factorin naming this book Cold Fusion 3.0. The ONLYreferences to 3.0 are ""it should be out bythe time this book is published"". Looks likethe author/publisher wanted to capitalize onCold Fusions popularity and not give a bookcontaining 3.0 applications. The 20 applicationsin the book will get a new Intranet on itsfeet, however, the code will have to be rewrittento work best. Some applications use ColdFusion 1.5, which is totally unacceptable being2.0 was available before this book went to press.Money.. The author had some good ideas andwanted to cash in, instead he should have rewritten the applications in Cold Fusion 3.0,using some new features (CFTREE, etc) and thisbook would have been a must have. Instead, itsa beginners only book for small organizations.You can't judge a book by its cover."
2,no 3.0 in ColdFusion 3.0,I could not find any reference to any 3.0 specific tags like the new Java tree and grid interface applets. The one screen shot with a tree was actually a .gif. Book does not have an index
4,Excellent Text but the CD-ROM is very badly organised,The text is excellent very clearly written and with a good dollop of common sense. My gripe is that I was hoping for a simple and easy way to get the examples up and running.(1) Should all be in the one database for ease of installation(2) should all run of the one directory tree(3) Should in fact all be on the CD-ROM I think that one of the databases is missing!Overall it's a great book but the implementation of the CD is poor.
4,Not for the beginner - but good examples,"If (as I was), you want a book which has lots of sample code that you can tear to pieces and transplant into your own systems, then this book is for you.However, if you want to find a book which teaches you Cold Fusion, look at Ben Forta's book instead."
2,"Too thin, wrong angle on important topic","I was aware that this book was outdated by the time I ordered it, but I was curious to see what exactly it had to offer.Ironically, it's best use (IMHO) is NOT how to use ColdFusion to build an intranet - the code exampled used are too simple and rudimentary to do much good without major tweaking - but, rather, as an introduction to the intranet concept. And as such, it actually does a decent job. Now, if only Mr. Desborough had stuck with elaborating in depth on the structural setup of an intranet and mentioned ColdFusion only in passing, then it would have been a really good read.As it is, the book can no longer be recommended. CF3.0 is too outdated, and the code examples are downright lame - more space is wasted on gratuitous hype for the consultants and companies who have written the code than on actual code. And a large part of the code consists of commented-out copyright notices from those same consultants. Waste of paper."
1,Appalling!,"This is book is horrible. I almost failed my class because I read this book before I read Forta's book. I thought I was going to get ahead of the game, instead I got behind."
1,Great artist recorded badly,It's too bad that one of the greatest jazz singers singing hallmark songs was recorded so poorly. This record is just no fun 'tall.
1,Deformed Flowers,"Don't bother purchasing these homemade confections; they came broken in tiny pieces, and the few that made it whole were either deformed or too small to see a design. These were exorbitantly pricey and didn't even arrive in the condition they were advertised as."
1,Dont buy,What a cheap refill. I ordered two of them and neither one worked well. They skipped and I had to write over alot. Save your money.
3,Thick ink,"I used this for a replacement in another type of pen that fits the same size refill. Writes very smooth, but does seem a bit thick. It can smear, so lefties watch out. Hoping this lasts longer then the one it replaced."
1,Really doesn't work for me,"This is the refill that Cross puts in its SelecTip pens and I have acquired a lot of them. My experience is the same with each pen, and it is not pretty.Skips. Smearing. Bleeding across the paper. A terrible experience.The Cross jumbo ballpoint refill is decent. This one is not."
2,This is the 'best' lesbian erotica (?),"The major reason that the stories held my attention, was that they were short. There is very little literary value to the selection and the stories lack the erotia and passion that I was expecting to find. The sensuality is missing and the only thing that is appealing are a few sentences from collection's 200 pages. Unless the use of cheap vulgarity and toys is a must in erotic lesbian stories, it is quite unlikely that an average woman will be captivated by this book. Better work then this should be expected from a lesbian anthology."
2,Not Understanding,"This book was my second lesbian book I've ever read. And I was taught new things that I never knew were possible with a woman's body and then again some I really didn't want to know. There were some sentences in some of the stories that were sensual more than erotic. I prefer sensual over exotic right now. I guess I didn't know erotic meant exotic. I felt a little bit intimidated by most of the stories and was perplexed by many. I don't think it's a good book for a newly out lesbian like myself as it has mostly hardcore action happening. I wish I could sell it for it is too late to return but I don't wish to read it again. One story I did find quite intriging but not worth buying the whole thing, which was Water Marks by Dawn Dougherty."
4,Interesting read not a lot of practical use,"If you are a student of canine behavior and body language, by all means but there are better books out there for those seeking practical information."
2,"Lots of Facts, but quite a few crazy ideas too.","I think it has REALLY good facts, but could be better. If you want to learn about canine behavior facts, this is really good for you to read. It has a lot of author opinions and a little crazy ideas. But overall worth your time in reading."
5,vacuum bags,Fast & Pleasant transaction. There was an error in the item shipped and it was promptly corrected without any difficulties. Would buy from again.
1,do not fit,"The bags I received had the cardboard ""collar"" that fits into the hole on the Kenmore glued all the way down. There was no edge to slip into the part that holds the bag in place. I was able to peel back the cardboard a bit to make some work, but others developed tears so that the bag became useless. I only give one star because the item does not work as is."
5,They Fit my Vacuum,Ordered online rather than trying to find at store and it fits my canister vac perfectly as described.
4,New ideas,"Most PhD theses don't get reprinted in book form, like this. So it suggests an exceptional quality thesis. Here, Dhawan gives us a sophisticated mathematical modelling of business cycles. And of the productivity difference between large and small firms, as seen in the US.The key idea he offers is how to incorporate the heterogeneous nature of large and small firms into a macroscopic, econometric-style model of a business cycle. Earlier work by others had mostly ignored this effect.His results may not perhaps be conclusive, but they certainly suggest an ingenious and incisive viewpoint. Worthy of further study."
3,"The cotton is nice & soft, but it's a little small","The cotton is nice & soft, and it's pretty absorbent. However for some reason, they're smaller than Lansinoh's disposable nursing pads, so they tend to shift around in my bra and fall out fairly easily when I open my bra to breastfeed. There are two darts that are supposed to form a pocket to hold the pad in place, but again the pad's too small so the pocket's too small to work.I've thrown them in the washer and dryer several times and so far no shrinking or pilling or anything. I'd give them 5 stars if they were the same size as the disposables."

1,No Fender Logo,"No logo as pictured, plain and a little big, tried to communicate but got no response. If you order this beware of an imitation that's not a Fender product!"
1,Where can you find a Zero rating when you need one?,"There are some novels that you know from the first page will be a waste of time. Promising writers can manage to entice a reader to hang in there after the first ten to fifteen pages, mediocre writers might take sixteen to twenty pages to do it while the abysmally untalented could trick you into false hope within the first chapter; but when you know from the first five pages that a story has taken off, crashed, burned, and ready for burial, well I don't know what type of writer could do that. Not much interested in spending any time writing about the ""plot"" or ""characters"" as this story is so implausible and the writing so puerile that it doesn't warrant in-depth review (that would falsely imply that there was some depth to the novel). Jeffery Mingo's review below is more analysis than the novel deserves and I agree with him completely. I can't believe I paid full price for this dreck!"
1,NO Ma'am,I boring read. I got grossed out during the beginning of the book. I figured the book would be a great read if the author developed the plot. Well of course it wasn't. I think the book belongs at the bottom of a trash can.
4,Thank goodness for the internet!,Thank goodness for Amazon for carrying these bags! I looked at several specialty vacuum stores/repair shops as well as several Sears stores and couldn't find these bags any longer. My vacuum is over 12 years old and still works well so being able to still find the bags makes my husband happy! Thanks Amazon!
4,Vacuum Cleaner Bags,"Bags are fine. Came quickly. One extra. Package had been opened and resealed, but that was fine."
2,Not up to par!,"Don't let the impressive sounding names fool you! Yes, I know it's the Oratorio Society of New York and the Sinfonia Rubenstein but this performance is substandard. The orchestra sounds alright, but the chorus and solos leave much to be desired. This recording sounds more than anything like a ""Romantic Period"" Messiah...big chorus, big orchestra...about as Baroque as a Chopin Etude. The tenor sings pretty much the notes on the page...little or no ornamentation and his melissmi sound like portamenti...just a bland and uninteresting performance! The chorus, while they obviously know the notes, has no refinement. It basically just sounds like a big crowd of Americans slogging through yet another Messiah gig! Do yourself a favor, find another recording of Messiah...ANY other recording of Handel's Magnum Opus would have to better than this!"
4,At least one of our three cats likes this,"As any cat lover can attest, you can provide a toy for your cat but there's no guarantee they will play with it. We have three cats: our Siamese has no interest in the toy at all, the tortoiseshell plays with it occasionally, and our fluffy orange tabby just LOVES it. The toy does go in and out of favor; they will ignore it for weeks and then something piques their interest and it's suddenly fun again. We put little toy mousies, twinkle balls, and other items they like in the box and let them fish around in it to get the toys out. I think kittens would particularly enjoy this. It's sturdy wood so it's not something that can get squashed out of shape (although it hurts like hell if you stub your toes on it going to the bathroom in the middle of the night). Our cats get enough enjoyment out of it that it was a purchase well spent."
4,"Great product, but some minor flaws","I got this because my cat loves sticking his paws into things. One of his favorite ""toys"" is a tissue box with a toy mouse inside, so I bought this thinking he would enjoy it. While my cat doesn't really enjoy getting toys out of this box, he will play around if there are treats in there. This is much more pleasing in a decorative sense than a tissue box! The only flaws were that 2 nails were sticking out. I read in reviews that this could be a problem, so I made sure to check it out before I let my cat play with it. I just put 2 layers of duck tape over the nails to fix that. Other than that, great product. Looks very nice."
1,"Good, except for exposed nails","The idea is great, unfortunately there are exposed nails. On 3 of the 4 sides, it looks like they missed the edge and punched the nails right through from the top to the inside where my cat's arm could get caught on them.The wood inside is very rough, even sanding it with 80 grit sandpaper would be a huge improvement.There's also a sticker on the bottom cheerfully informing you that the Formaldehyde content is within tolerances."
2,Watch out!,Do not let kittens play with this unsupervised! I had an emergency trip to the vet with a kitten with her head stuck in one of the holes on the Peek-a-Prize toy box. Lucky I found her before she panicked too much.
4,our cat likes it!,"After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give this toy a try. I'm glad I did because our cat definitely likes it! Her favorites with this product are definitely treats! But she'll also play with small toy mice, jingly bell balls, and fuzzy toy balls. She also sleeps on it. Luckily it appears to be made of sturdy material.I do agree with several reviewers on the balls that came with it. Our cat did not like them at all. They are too large to fit through the holes without a lot of force and she got bored with them after a minute. I recommend trying the duct tape idea as one reviewer mentioned or other toys/treats if your cat does not play with it.Overall I would say it is a great product. Just remember to try different things with it."
2,meh.,"My kitten has thankfully pretty much liked every toy I've gotten for her, even though I have to rotate many of them so she doesn't become bored. After researching and checking all the reviews here, I decided to purchase this for her. How disappointing that she wasn't interested in it at all. She will walk over it every now and again, bat a paw, but that's about it. When I look at the cost/benefit of the toys I buy her, this one is pretty low on the list, particularly when I have gotten some great ones for half the cost."
1,Safety concern,Please read all the other reviews here regarding safety issues -- this is a potential hazard and disaster waiting to happen.
2,It looks like it is a lot more fun than it really is,"My one year old cat became bored with this toy pretty quickly. I can get him to have some interest in it by putting fresh catnip in it, but he really isn't entertained by the toy itself. He got the balls out of the toy very quickly when I first gave it to him, and he never showed much interest in it since then."
1,I guess my cats are stupid!,"I thought for sure my youngest, Snowball, would really love this toy. She liked the box it came in more! The product mentions ""Smart Cat"" and both my cats, Snowball who is 2 and Sweetie Pie who is 6 were not at all curious about this toy. I don't consider them ""stupid"" either! I think if it came with authentic looking furry mice instead of the balls, they may have showed some interest. The balls that come with it are ok, but when I took them out to play with just the balls, my cats weren't interested in them either! Now I'm out $30.00! Maybe someday I will have a friend who has a kitten (I think a kitten would find this toy fun) and I can give it to them!"
2,Cats lost interest after a few minutes,"My cats were excited with it for a few minutes then lost all interest. My cats play with any new toy for a few minutes andthen don't use it anymore. I was hoping this peek a prize might interest them. However, they don't like the peek-a-prize.They only like to play with interactive toys."
1,Cats didn't like it,I just recently got a new kitten and thought she would enjoy this box but she wasn't interested. My older cats didn't like it either but that wasn't a surprise. My kitten preferred other toys over this one so I think it's one of those things that they either love it or hate it. I will be donating this item.
3,Smartcat~Peek a prize,"I was disappointed at the size of the box,,,,,,,it appeared to be much bigger in the ad. I have 2 large cats (24#cat and 12# kitten) and I was hoping it would have been big enough for them. Again they are sometimes interested, but not as much as I thought that they would be. The box is made quite well, and all edges are smooth.........but I thought that the holes should have been larger.TY"
3,He liked the packaging!,"The peek-a-prize seems like a great idea. The set comes in a glossy cardboard sleeve for packaging. My cat played with the peek-a-prize for about 5 minutes total, but he has been playing with that cardboard for three days now.Also, the side holes allow the included balls to roll out quite easily. In the five minutes he got the ball out about ten times. Using little stuffed mice might be better. When my cat sees me drop one of his toys in a hole he goes for it for about 20 seconds and then gets interested in other things."
1,Balls slip out of the holes very easily,"This toy was completely useless the day it came, the balls slip right out of the holes, and it takes about 2 seconds for my cats to remove the balls from the toy this way. They had more fun chasing the balls around the house since they couldn't play with the box part. Complete waste of money."
2,Not interested,"This product is well made and may work well with curious kittens, but none of my 4 adult cats were interested at all. I donated it to Goodwill."
4,A great puzzle box for treats,My cat liked it for the first day or so but then got bored and never bothered playing with the different types of balls and other toys I put in the box. Then one day I needed to distract her so instead of putting some treats in her bowl I dropped them into this puzzle box and she had a great time fishing them out. Now she looks so forward to the box coming out and fishing for just a few treats will keep her busy for quite a while ;-)
3,Grows on them,the one thing that works with this product is the thought process for the cat but when they get the balls out of the box it isn't that great. I had to place twin around the sides to make it more difficult for both my cats.
3,You just never know,None of my cat children had any interest in this but you just never know what they're going to love or be indifferent toward. It is well made and didn't have the manufacturing problems some other reviews mentioned. Just wish they play with it!
5,Very entertaining toy,"I do not know who had more fun with this toy, the cats or us watching them play. The one cat would run around with the ball in her mouth after she had taken it out.SmartCat 3833 Peek-a-Prize Pet Toy Box"
1,NOT SAFE,"I agree - this toy is made beautifully......It could sit on your coffee table. HOWEVER - for larger cats......it is very dangerous. I was playing with it with my 11 month old Ragdoll cat. He's paw got stuck in one of holes and he got scarred and tried to run, The toy weighs probably 5 pounds and had I not been there, he could have easily broken a leg. If you ""have to have it"" I highly suggest that you are there supervising while your cat plays with this toy."
1,Cats are so bored ..,"My cats may be diff than others, but they were never excited with this box full of holes. They are so bored with it that they don't even play with it when I put treats inside. As I say, it could be my cats but it was not worth the price or trouble."
3,Engaging but there was a manufacturing problem,"We liked the design of the Peek-a-Prize Pet Toy Box and the general feel of it. The finish is nice and the edges are smooth, outside of the nail gun holes around the outside. The toy box portals are large enough that our Maine Coons can get their large snowshoe paws into them easily and the box supported their weight.However, like others have said, there were nails sticking out inside the box that cut one of my friend's fingers as he was moving one of the toys for my cats. After the injury, we looked inside the box and saw five nails poking out of the edges and walls of the box, each about an inch long. I'm happy we caught the problem before the cats were injured.Now that our cats have fallen in love with the toy box (mostly for foraging food), we'll make modifications (as another review suggested) to make it work safely for us."
3,"Quite a furor for a new toy, but...","All three of my cats loved this contraption - the only problem is once the intial newness was done, I have to put it out of sight for a few days and then bring it out again so it can be played with like a new toy. It is always a good idea to rotate all their toys so they feel like they are new!"
3,Started Too Late,I introduced my cat to this product when he was almost fully grown. I believe it would have been far more successful had he been younger and more active to start with. It just reemphasized to me the necessity of starting our pets out right in the first place with training and behavioral expectations.
2,Not so good,"My cat got bored with this so fast. After she took the balls out, you have to fetch the balls and put them back in. If you have a smart cat, she'll figure it out quick and also quickly get bored. My bangle cat lost interest after a day."
2,Holes larger than ball,"It's a cool concept, but since the holes around the outer edge are large enough for the ball to fit through....the balls stick around for a matter of minutes. The cat enjoys this but will only get to play with it as long as I can keeping finding those balls under the furniture!"
2,Good but...,This product is fun for my kitten for 2 or 3 quick minutes 5 or 6 times a day. For a spazzy kitten that's pretty good! The only problem I had with this product was that the bottom board came off the first time I picked it up. It wasn't a big deal once I super glued it back together. Over all my kitten enjoys the toys inside the box much more than the actual product itself.
1,Cat Safety,I had to return this item due to safety concerns. I discovered that the finish nails that held down the top piece of wood were not lined up correctly. Sharp exposed finish nails on the top interior posed a real safety concern. My cat could have been severely injured had I not discovered this defect. The maker should always inspect a toy before shipping it to a customer.
1,"I'm very Sorry, but ....","To the manufacturer: The concept was perfect, the fit & finish of your cat toy flawless, the price point very reasonable, and my 2 cats started immediately playing with it just like in the pictures. I'm a carpenter (yes, I could've easily made the box myself, but my time & $$ and such a reasonable price...) Amazing! but.... one of my cats got his foreleg (paw?) really stuck above the elbow reaching inside at such an angle I couldn't twist or move it to free it. For @ 5 very exciting minutes, there was nothing I could do about it; cat thrashing around, snarling; scared the heck out of me (and kitty). The finish work is so smooth and well done there was no damage to kitty rather the hole size and box depth. My apologies to a fine product, but ... Caveat Emptor."
2,WARNING!!!,"Make sure you check for nails sticking out inside the box! Mine had 2 nails sticking out right inside the holes where the cats stick their paws fishing for a toy! I am glad I found this before giving it to my cats! The nails are the ones attaching the top of the box to the sides. They can be felt by sticking your finger in the holes and carefully feeling along the sides of the box. I am going to contact the company, and hopefully they will issue a recall or at least check their quality control. I think it is a great toy, but not if is going to injure cats paws!"
3,My cats weren't fans...,"I think a lot of toys like this need to be introduced when they're still kittens. My older cats looked at me like a crazy person when I put balls and treats inside. They batted at it a couple of times and never looked back. They love to get toys out of paper bags, so i thought this would appeal to their sense of ""hunting"". Sadly, it was a bust. Donating it to the animal shelter instead."
4,Plain Fun,"Our cat Emma had a ball playing with this silly box. We dumped a bit of Catnip in it to get her extra enticed, but she loves this thing. We've had it for around 2 months now and she still plays with it, cute design, nicely made."
1,My cats don't care for this,I was looking for ways to help stimulate my cats to exercise and play. Unfortunately they are not remotely interested in this. Maybe at 6 years old they are just too old for it. It seems that maybe kittens would like this. I plan to give it to someone with a kitten and see what happens.
3,Enjoyed for 1 minute,My cat was curious just to look at it and explore it for about 1 minute. Then I couldnt get her to glance at it ever again. I love the idea and I think some cats would love this toy. But I believe my cat likes to be lazy and have the balls/toys come back to her. She prefers a circular toy where she can lay down and the toy comes back around to her. This toy-Not good for lazy cats!
2,My cats just didn't like this,"There is nothing wrong with this product at all - it's a terrific concept. But my cats just do NOT like it. We had made our own out of a shallow cardboard box with a lid, cutting in squares, triangles and circles and adding a variety of kitty toys. They LOVED it. With 7 cats, the cardboard wasn't sturdy enough for so much play so I ordered this sturdy model. They are not the least interested even though I've added their own toys, including a few freshly-dipped in catnip toys.So I've not a clue why this didn't work for me. Perhaps your luck would be better. The product itself is just fine!"
3,"Great concept, cats just dont dig the balls (use popcorn)","I saw this and had to have it. Unfortunately, cats don't feel the same. The balls that come with it are too stiff (hard rubbery) for cats to get. Cats like to grab stuff with claws, they cant do that with these balls because they are too hard. Ive tried other balls but cats get bored.By accident, I dropped popcorn inside this thing...cats went NUTS!!!!! So now when I make popcorn, they run to this thing waiting for me to put some popcorn inside. Then they try to fling it out with their claws. Forget the balls, use other stuff in this toy like popcorn, packing peanuts, crumpled up paper, etc."
3,So-So,Received this with great excitement. We have three cats. One plays with it sometimes. The other two ignore it completely. Really sorry I bought it.
4,Not a bad toy if your cat is interested,"I have held off buying this for some time, due to price. I made one myself out of a FedEx box, and put balls and mice inside, and she is marginally interested. I decided to finally get this one, though, due to the amount of holes.When I purchased this, I didn't order any balls, as Princess has balls and mice and other toys that would fit nicely inside. However, upon unpacking this, I discovered two small balls that fits nicely inside.What I like about this is that putting treats inside makes her interested. I also use the Da Bird with the small mouse-attachment and dump it in one of the holes and wiggle it around. Princess really like that. So we do get a lot of time to play together, but she's mostly uninterested in playing without me."
4,Good item - if your cat isn't too lazy,"This is a nice wooden box, which I anticipated using to force my cats to work for their dinner. That didn't work, and they weren't interested in the balls that came with the box either. The product is nice, but just didn't work for me.Basically, the box has 25 holes on the top and 4 along each edge. There is plenty of room for the cat to paw into the holes to reach whatever is inside. With a more adventurous cat, this might work."
2,didn't work out,"Well, you never know, but I thought I'd try this for my 2 year old maine coon who's very playful, I liked that it was wooden, but he checked it out for about 5 minutes and never looked at it again even though I've tried to get him going with strings and things through it. He loves the plastic donut shaped toy that's a similar concept with a ball inside that he pushes around and tries to get, but he's completely bored with this one. I think it's just way too easy for him to get anything out of it. Ah well."
3,"quality product, but your cat may or may not use it","This is a well-made product, very solid. But, my cats (about 1.5 years old) ignore it like it's their job. This is probably a great toy for a kitten."
2,Good idea-but!,"My cats enjoyed the Peek-a-Prize for about 30 seconds. They were having fun with it, but after about 4 swipes with their paws, the balls came out through the holes. They continued to play and chase the balls but the Peek-a-Prize just sat on the floor and was forgotten. I think the idea has merit but it needs larger balls that won't come out through the holes. Otherwise you might just as well buy balls and throw them on the floor."
3,Nice idea but....,"My cat is home alone during the day so I bought this thinking it would help alleviate some of the boredom she was experiencing. It's a great idea and I'm sure for some cats it's really exciting. My cat is high energy, being part Bengal but she only likes this ""toy"" when I put treats inside with her toys. Once the treats are all found she no longer tries to take anything out. I wouldn't return it but I wouldn't tell someone else to go out and spend the money on it either. You could hide treats around the house in various containers and probably get a happier, more curious cat. Not a bad product but not excitingly awesome either."
2,well-made but genrally ignored,"I thought my cat would love this toy, but she mostly just ignores it. I find I'm spending more time fishing things in and out of the holes than she does. It is well-made and would last for years if your cat enjoys it."
2,peek-a-prize,I have three cats and none of them are interested in this product. I have tried putting different toys in it and used string in it to try and get them interested in the product but nothing has worked yet. I would not recommend this product.
5,Great fun for kittehs!,"While our Elder Cats were mostly not at all interested in this puzzle box, our 2 youngest went nuts with it. And since wearing them out so they didn't but the Elder Cats so much was a part of the point, it was perfect!How much they play with it is VERY dependent on what toys I've stocked it with. One goes crazy for those plastic springs- she likes to carefully extract them and then bat them around and POUNCE. The other one prefers milk bottle rings, but for the same reason.I've had it put away for a while because they were getting bored; it's time to bring it out again and re-stock it... and maybe add some kitty treats to keep them interested.I love the sturdiness, and that it's not made of cardboard, which one of my playful cats could squash if he sat on it (he's a big lad!).Highly recommended! Plus, I see there's a somewhat smaller version if this one is just too large."
3,fast delivery,This is a new product that arrived in excellent condition...it came before the anticipated shipping date...My cats were curious initially but now pass it by but cats are known to be finicky!
3,Cat toy,"This toy interests my cat when I load it up with toys and draw her attention to it, but she loses interest quickly and doesn't go back to it on her own. She likes playing with balls in it the best."
3,Good Quality but....,Kitty played with this for only 15 minutes when we first took it out of the box. Now she seems to ignore it. We'll try putting it away for a while and take it out at a later date to see if she'd play with it again. May also try putting treats in the hole. It's a good quality product and the balls are nice and colorful.
4,Cats enjoy it,"My cats like this toy!The balls are easy to get out and once they are out my cats lose interest. They've actually taken to dropping food or other things inside it and try to get it out.It's giving them lots of fun, and that's important."
1,not even close,"We were there! ""Amazing day"", without question. ""Captured on (this) DVD"", not even close."
5,Excellent!!,"I am an Iranian who's been living in the UK for more than 20 years. Having listened to this CD, it reminded me of the good old days back home when life was so different.If you're like me, I recommend that you buy this CD and immerse yourself in a bit of nostalgia!!"
5,From Publix Works Great,Bought two of these from publix to use to move dishes when i moved. They worked great and now i use them for laundry.
5,You're Killing me,"Rare and hard to find -perfect billionare yacht music. Turn up and dance till your wiskers turn blue and fall off, Chachita Kitten."
4,Ludlow did his homework on Isaiah!,"The content of the book is great. But there is a break down the spline at page 116! There are some marking here and there, underlinings etc.But it otherwise is in pretty good condition."
5,understanding Isaiah,"Isaiah is a complicated read to understand, from the Bible. Victor L. Ludlow brings a superior understanding of Isaiah to this book. He is able to explain it in such a way to make it understandable. This book stands alone in this regard."
5,basketball historian's dream,"Great version of the renegade leagues story. Fascinating for anyone who loves pro basketball history, especially anyone who lived during the late sixties and early seventies."
5,Fall-on-your-afro funny!,"The ABA was filled with great players and great personalities, and Pluto's book gives you the whole shebang. Detailed accounts of the league's founding, teams comings, goings, and movings, and side-splitting memories from coaches, players, announcers (Bob Costas's blooper is legendary) and even Pat Boone, who owned a team briefly. Plus find out why the owners of the Spirits of St. Louis were the luckiest saps who ever walked the earth when the league finally merged with the NBA. Highly recommended for sports fans of all sorts."
5,THREE GREAT SCREENPLAYS BY JOHN SAYLES!,"This book includes the screenplay to John Sayles latest film, ""SILVER CITY"" and two others, ""SUNSHINE STATE"" and ""PASSION FISH"", but NOT ""MATEWAN"", ""LONE STAR"", or any of the others listed on this page. The title page says this is volume one so obviously the other plays will be in future volumes.The screenplay to ""SILVER CITY"" is great! When I bought the book I didn't intend on reading the script until after I saw the film, but I started reading one night and was hooked! I couldn't stop. I had to find out how it ended. And it is wonderful. I can't wait to see the film.The book also includes introductions to each play by Mr. Sayles. He is insightful as always.Any Sayles fan/ or indie film fan will love this book! -George Bauch."
5,great stuff,My friends and i use to take this stuff over 20 years ago. unbelievable results.We went from chumps to champs within 3 months .im glad i found it again.it was temporarily removed cause it was so potent.
1,Must be mislabeled,"This is the hottest enchilada sauce I have ever tasted. Even although the can is marked ""Mild"" it is approximately one step away from bringing tears to your eyes. We actually had to throw the meal We prepared away because no one could eat it. If the can had been marked ""Medium"" ( which would still be a strech) or ""Hot"" We would not have purchased it."
1,Eating Sand,"I purchased this sauce from 3 different grocery stores since I had a bad experience with sand grains in the sauce. Twice from two different grocery stores I had a problem with sand particles in the very bottom of the can. I even heated the sauce just to see if it might go away. Well it did not. You can see the and taste and feel the sand crunching in your mouth, it sure was not the chilies. I never had this problem with this brand before. I will not purchase Las Palmas again, very disappointed!!"
5,Color Box is bound to bring you a lot of joy,"This relatively small, but very colorful book, covers so many topics that each one is more like an overview, giving you a taste of what it involves if you desire to explore it further. It contains a little bit of everything dealing with color: how colors influence people's emotions and behavior, the use of colors in decorating and clothing, a bit of feng shui, use of color in healing, a touch of colors in auras, an overview of Aura Soma Products - pomanders and equilibrium oils and much more. The seven pomanders which are included in this set are a sheer delight - they are very brightly colored and have lovely scents - some are more fruity, some are more spicy - and while I generally don't like any commercial perfumes, I love these pomanders. From the very first day, they have stimulated some very interested dreams and I have found them very uplifting.It also crossed my mind that this Color Box would make a wonderful gift."
2,didn't like it,"I have the prenatal work out. I didn't get much of a work out from it- and it was very irritating that she pronounced ""salsa"" incorrectly (""salZZZA"")."
4,Vastly different from standard unimaginative danceclub music,"After owning World Clique on tape since junior high I figured it was time to upgrade. This box set was exactly what I was expecting, I really enjoyt it. This set an excellent collection of music I call ""happyfunky music."" Deee-Lite's first album, World Clique, is still by far her finest work. The two more recent CD's included in this set have a dance club music kind of sound - but still very characteristic of Deee-Lite's individual style. Deee-Lite fans will not be disappointed. The third CD in this set is all remixes, some from the other two CD's in the set (about half) some from others not in the set. A few of the remixes really aren't different enough to be called remixes, but this is an excellent set to buy if you're interested in chilling and relaxing to music you can also shake your hips to and music that is vastly different from that incessant beat of standard unimaginative repetitive dance club music."
1,Headline for this product is misleading,"The headline for this product says it is 1000 watts. But from everything else, it looks like it is 800 watts.This is misleading. The headline is what caused me to look at this product. I feel manipulated and will look at other ones instead."
2,For Phillips' Students Only,"I learned *after* buying this book that the string bending techniques shown by the esteemed Dobroist Mr. Phillips are pretty much his and his alone. In other words, if you don't possess the G-d-given facility to slant the bar *and* bend a string simultaneously (which 99.9% of us don't), then this book is useless to you. What's good about it? The ""rhythm changes"" section, which incidentally I haven't seen in other Dobro books/videos. I recommend the Dobro Roadmaps book for chord diagrams and progression studies instead."
3,Good book for a beginner,"This book is a good ""quick start"" guide for beginners. it is an excellent reference for basic chord patterns as well."
1,WordSmart is so much better!,I've tried myriad vocabulary-augmenting programs but I think that the best is the WordSmart computer program. Verbal advantage was really dull and took too long between each word. Plus it wastes time by going over words you already know. The WordSmart program was much more effective and efficient. My SAT score and vocabulary went way up!
3,Williams in the raw.,"Ex-Toto lead vocalist takes a stab at being solo. This album is somewhat raw from what fans may be used to with Toto in terms of instrumental harmony. Although Williams' talent as a high note vocalist takes precedence in this album, accompanied with a basic 80's sound of good old fashioned rock. Fans of Williams will enjoy his debut album."
3,welding,this product seems to a good product but I don't think it will handle bits much larger than a 6'' bit beacuse I have had the half moon key shear when using a 5'' bit. the base seems good but te dill motor will not hold up the half moon key shears not the shear pin as designed it needs a motor with a clutch. so if your thinking about using a lager bit than a 5'' look toward a different motor size and I don't think it would ever hold up to the 16'' drill bit.
4,Great bag for a Pentax,I really like this bag - it is very compact and holds just enough stuff for an outing.
3,camera bag,it was too small for the camera and lense that i have (canon d40 and 17-55mm lens). would like to get one slightly larger. it well made. probably fit a canon rebel better.
5,"Nice looking, functional, durable",This bag fits my Olympus E520 perfectly with the 18-180 lens on the camera. It is well cushioned and I am confident it will protect the camera from bumps and other insults. It seems waterproof as well but I don't intend to test that feature. Overall very well constructed.
2,Quite disappointed with quality of bag....,"Bag does fit my Canon T1i with regular lens. But zipper got destroyed, and the padding is not so thick. I bought another bag with better padding and construction."
4,Perfect for my Canon Rebel XSi with the kit lens (18-55 mm).,"It fits my Canon Rebel XSi with the kit lens (18-55 mm), and that is it. I mean, when I attach any slightly longer lens to my camera, it doesn't fit anymore."
5,Excellent Book!!!!!,"This book was faced paced and difficult, in fact impossible, to put down! Just when you think you have the story all figured out....you realize you don't. You're not sure who the good guys and the bad guys are. Like one reviewer said you really don't know the WHOLE story until the end. I had a lot of admiration for Giselle. She was a very strong and smart woman. I also fell in love with Raz. He was a man of many secrets but he did have a true love for Giselle.This story had it all...military intrigue, action, suspense and romance. I highly recommend this book. It's one that you can easily read again and again and see things you missed the first time.I hope we see more books in the future by L.K. Malone."
3,patsy,"""Divided Loyalties"" did not live up to my expectations. As with any book, if it doesn't grab my interest right away, I give it at least 100 pages & then if it doesn't, I put it down. This one did peak my interest because of the religious reference,so I stayed with it, but I didn't connect with any character & I couldn't keep track of who was really who. This book was recommended to me by a friend whom I exchange books with often,but this one didn't make my list. I did finish it,but it just wasn't my kind of story."
5,Best,I love these bags because they dont leak and they are easy to tag label and store . A must have for a pumping breast feeding mom .
1,Okay bags--BEWARE of leaking!!!,"With my first daughter, I breastfed exclusively and really never EBM. If I did, I would use the storage bottles from Medela. So when I had my second child about 3 months ago, she had a difficult time latching on. I went to the store and purchased Gerber FB and these Lansinoh FB. I loved the Gerber bags but soon ran out and started using the Lansinoh. I have been using the frozen milk now that I am back at work. Every single Lansinoh bag I have defrosted in my fridge has leaked. It is ridiculous. I have cleaned out my fridge so many times due to this. Maybe I got a defective batch or something but I never had that problem with Gerber. I really do like the double seal. It helps get all the air out of the bag. Overall, I would use Gerber. I will never buy these bags again."
4,Nice product compared to other bags,"I like that there are two zippers on the bag. They are freezable without double bagging (Avent bags require double bagging for freezing, which basically doubles the cost of storage) and are a lot easier to open than the Gerber bags. The sides split easier than the Gerber bags, but the Gerbers are so difficult to pry open that I often find myself tearing through the top of the bag. Overall, of the three kinds I've tried, these are the best."
1,"would give no stars, use cheap bottles",my hubby and I never had any luck with any brand of storage bags. all of them leaked while thawing and we had trouble getting our daughter to take her bottle. we thought it was because she was used to being exclusively breastfed but then one day my husband tasted the milk...it tasted just like rubbing alcohol!!! it was gross. we immediately froze some milk in a boring old 99 cent bottle as an experiment: she took her bottle just fine and the milk tasted normal. we stocked up on the 3 packs of 4/5 ounce bottles from Evenflo and Gerber and sealing discs and froze milk in those. It worked wonderfully and when she was weaned we cleaned the bottles and stored them. we have a boy now that's a week old and we got out the bottles and sterilized them. works like a charm. they have already paid for themselves many times over since they're reusable.
3,Okay true crime book,"If you're just looking to pass the time by reading a true crime novel that happens to feature some Skinheads that obviously didn't get along with their parents, their brother or agree with their belief system (Jehovah's Witness) and you can get it for cheap then it's an okay read.Just don't expect a literary classic."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this dumbbell rack and am somewhat disappointed. The problem is I had to go out and purchase some hex nuts that fit. The ones shipped with the rack were poor. When put together it wobbled from side to side and was very unstable. Now that I have the new hex nuts, it is stable.I don't recommend purchasing this product unless you want to buy parts so it will work properly. In fact, I will avoid all products made by the company in the future."
4,It's a rack made of steel what else do you want???,"I didn't have the issues of mismatched bolts so I cant comment on the other post. However for my home gym, it functions just fine with 35-lb, 30-lb, 25-lb,10-lb, and 5-lb absolutely fine. The paint finish is glossy and looks nice. Not much more to say here, it's stable and does its job."
1,Missing all hardware.,"While the rack is very sturdy once assembled, this item arrived in very poor condition and was missing all hardware. The box was completely destroyed with large junks missing and other pieces of cardboard hanging off in several places. The rack was very scratched and damaged, and the hardware packet was completely missing. Fortunately I had the necessary hardware on hand from a rack of this brand that I had purchased previously, so I did not have to return the item. The item itself is a very good dumbbell rack and is very sturdy, so please bear in mind that the one-star rating I've given it is for the condition in which the item arrived and the lack of hardware."
1,Charts are missing,The cosimo classics edition is missing all but one of the various charts (14 total) referenced in the text. The charts are the heart of understanding the discussion in the book such that without them the book is virtually useless. $19.95 completely wasted.
2,"It was OK, but rather run of the mill.","While I respect the author's work in putting this book together, I was hoping for more entries re: women saints and near-saints who were known for their courage, including standing up to Church and civil authorities in the interest of Christian values. That may be my fault because I was looking for something that may not even exist."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"I ordered the Harmony remote directly from them a couple of weeks ago. A week later I was told that they had been swamped with orders, but that they were being shipped in the order that the orders were placed. At the end of that week a fellow employee who had ordered via fax a week after I did had already received theirs.When I last spoke to them, the owners son (very rude) essentally told me I'd get it when I get it. When I asked for a tracking number he stated ""What do you want me to do? Dance on my desk? If you ordered 20 of them I would get the number for you."" Obviously the individual consumer is not of a great concern to them.If this is how they treat their customers before they get the product, I'd hate to see what will happen once they have your money and you have a problem!"
2,Omits China and India,"I haven't purchased this set, but I did notice two surprising omissions in the lists above: China and India. I have no idea why a 2-CD set covering 73 countries would choose to omit the two most populous countries of the world (which together comprise one-third of the world's population), but it was one reason I decided to go with another anthem compilation."
3,Backoffice 4.5 Resource Kit,This kit is a bit expensive considering that most of the content is available online. But if your time is valuable or you like to have printed copy to look at it's worth it. What I found most helpful is the examples and information that comes on the CD.
5,Impressionist Delight-ful Reading,"If you love their art and you would like to learn about their personal friendships, this is the book to have. Highly recommend it."
4,dac,"awesome as always with DAC.....he still has it. mellowed some, but still has it!!! we have been huge fans of him for years......have everything he has ever done and this one is definelty up to his standards."
1,"Written Poorly - So Much So, I Couldn't Finish It!","I tried. I truly did. I yawned through the first 10 pages. Struggled through the next 20 and by the time I hit 142 pages, although I wanted to commit to it by then, I just COULD NOT! I know a writer has to be detailed - to paint a picture - but when it's written to the point where I no longer care, then it's over for me. The subject IS disturbing but it also didn't keep my interest. The mother, Sherry Vincent, came across as extremely uptight - to the point of being annoying - and I felt no sympathy for her. She came across as shrill - yeah, even in WORDS - she came across as shrill! I just couldn't handle it any longer! I'm not going to say DON'T read it, but if you do, I hope you have more patience than I do. I stopped at page 142 and STILL nothing EXTREME happened. A little excitement, but nothing that moved the story forward for me. Good luck with this read!"
1,Very Bad Movie,This is one of the worst movies I have ever purchased and tried to watch. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,Some interesting rarities,"This compilation contains some interesting songs and a few classics but falls short of presenting a comprehensive overview of the decade. Although there are a few UK artists, the album seems to contain mainly US chart hits since most tracks reached high positions on the Billboard charts. I'm not sure that all of them really did make it to number one on the American charts anyway. The classics include Rod Stewart's poignant You Wear It Well, LaBelle's raucous Lady Marmalade from 1972 which has often been covered down the years, Sweet's catchy Love Is Like Oxygen and Chi Coltrane's Thunder and Lightning. There are some classic hard rock singalongs like Black Betty by Ram Jam, Long Cool Woman by The Hollies and Your Mama Don't Dance by Loggins and Messina, plus some exquisite soft rock like Lotta Love by Nicolette Larson from about 1979 and Sister Golden Hair by America."
1,Chihuly's Pendletons Aren't!,"If you're a Dale Chihuly glass fan, you may appreciate this book, but if you're an Indian blanket collector don't waste your time and money. Memo to authors Chihuly and Lohrmann - HELLO!!, most of Chihuly's Pendletons AREN'T Pendleton blankets and so it's of absolutely no value to blanket collectors seeking accurate information. It's painfully obvious neither he nor co-author Charles Lohrmann has any idea what Chihuly has been collecting all these years! Chihuly's a wonderfully innovative glass artisan, but nobody did their homework here. It's just too bad the blanket information is as twisted as Mr. Chihuly's glass forms."
1,Dale Chihuly should stick to what he knows best--glass,"If you want to know about Native American trading blankets your money would be better spent on Kapoun's book titled ""Language of the Robe"" which tells it more like it is. I believe that Chihuly purchased the Kapoun's collection and became an overnight authority on the subject, if you catch my drift!I have photographed Pendleton blankets for years, and Chihuly and Lohrmann should be more accurate in their detailing of what is and isn't made by the Pendleton Woolen Mills. The photos are good, but there is still room for someone to do a thorough and interesting book on this very important topic. This isn't the one to waste money on, in my opinion."
3,Considering all things......,Considering that I live in a small town where the local Sears Store closed I decided to try buying bags online for my Kenmore. They aren't the heavy cloth bags like I was used to buying but they seem to work okay. I had a hard time popping it into place...but it finally went on and seems to be staying in place.
1,BUYER BEWARE!,GoVaccum has no idea of the difference between 3 & 12! The price for the 3 cheap bags is HIGHER than 3 OEM's from Sears!! These people will NOT respond to your emails you send them!
5,A GREAT price on these bags,"They are not cloth like the actual Kenmore bags, but they fit perfectly, seem well constructed and have the nice tape enclosure so you don't make a dust bomb when you throw away a full bag. A great deal!"
5,Product is perfect,"The price was right for these filters so they were included in my order, which was filled and shipped to me promptly."
4,"Good price, holds dirt","These vacuum bags fit as well as the OEM versions, but cost much less. I haven't seen any change in vacuuming performance, and they hold the dirt. What more could you ask?"
4,"Inexpensive, generic alternative - worked well","A good generic alternative to the name brand bags. Worked well, a little difficult to first use but with a little adjustment fit my vacuum."
3,"Vacuum bags are inexpensive, but not as good as the ones from Sears","The bags appear to be OK and the price was certainly good, but it appears the ones from Sears are made of a much better material."
5,Exactly what I needed.,"These bags were exactly right for my vacuum model, a great price, and arrived quickly. They work well and actually last a pretty long time."
5,Great Product!,These seem just as good as the packs of 2 for $10 from Sears. I was getting tired of having to make a special stop just for vacuum bags so this will be super handy....
1,"Description indicates 12 bags, Picture of product shows 9?","There is a big difference is price per bag when you compare total price to price per bag. The selling header info states 12 bags BUT the picture of the actual bags is 9 bags per package.. which is it, was this a listing error or deception?"
3,"THIN, THIN, THIN","I was very excited to find these at such a low price, however, the quality is questionable. I've only been using them for a few weeks, but they are terribly thin. The main challenge will be if they hold up and also if they contain the old ""dirt"" odor vacuum cleaners can get.If they do those two things, I will change my star rating."
3,Kenmore Upright Vacuum Bags,These bags were way cheaper than at sears and are the same quality they serve their purpose and are economical!!! Good Buy!!!
2,Jury still out,Brought this product after some reading and viewing the reviews. My son has delayed speech and is doing speech therapy. He is progressing steadily. Cant say that the product has help. No obvious changes since he started taking it three months ago.
4,efalex,I bought the lemon lime flavor of Efalex and my son loves the taste surprisingly. Haven't used it enough yet to have an opinion of it's efficacy.
4,Great product,Much easier for children to take. Had ordered this in the capsule version before but was difficult getting my son to swallow them without gagging. He actually says it taste good.
4,Where's the Go Remix?,"I know there's a remix for the title track on this CD Single, that's the only thing missing! The rest is cool, but I bought this because of the Corner remix. The remix for Come Close is okay, but waaay too long. A 5 star rating will come from me if the remix to Go is included."
3,Wasn't feeling Go too much... (3 Stars),"Go is Common's 2nd single off BE, and it's lukewarm at best. The concept is alright, but I wasn't feeling Kanye West's beat at all. The hook is pretty disappointing too, but Common comes through with his verses. However, it's good to see Common finally get the props he deserves. The Corner remix included on this single is tight, with Mos Def and Scarface each dropping verses."
5,"Great!, Want More!","The first reviewer nailed it, get it!. Any Zoot Sims fan will love this DVD. He sounds just like his swingin' self, it will sound like your cds. When it ended, my wife said, "" It's over already ! "", that sums it up. Great stuff, but you will want more."
1,don't waste your money,"this was as dull as it can get for erotica literature. the stories were too short, not enough sex, and the couple of stories that did have a good beginning, ended abruptly before you could even get wet reading it. i bought it used and i should have known better when the price was under a dollar that there was a good reason why."
2,daydreaming,"I'm daydreaming of a better book. I started reading with high hopes, vibrator ready, as my darling Norman was out of town on business, and ended up skimming past all the mystical tea-drinking madams,and just couldn't get excited, and damm, i didn't get to use my vibrator. very dissapointed."
1,Dull & pointless,"I couldn't finish this book. I put it down several times before I gave up completely. The dead body was irrelevant, the protagonist uninteresting, and the cloud of Russian suspense heavy-handed and cliched. I would also argue that Ironside made the relationships too artificially complex yet superficial for readers to care. This novel was a deep disappointment compared to the wonderful DEATH IN THE GARDEN."
5,Superb in every way,"We had purchased this same machine a couple years ago and really liked all the features. When the time came for our retail operation to add another cashier station, I was elated to find the exact machine was still available for purchase. Makes it easier for the cashier staff with both machines being identical and programmed the same in every way.Product arrived in record time and you have another very happy customer."
2,Entertaining read crippled by lack of documentation.,"Mr. Ponting has written a fascinating study. However, he has NO citations in a work that on nearly every page offers a variety of specific statistics to back up his claims. Just one example---most of the books written about WWII since 1945 have accepted a loss of life at roughly 50 million dead. Ponting claims that 85 MILLION died....and offers no proof of this. He doesn't even list a bibliography! Just ""recommended reading."" In short, this book contradicts almost everything else I've read about the subject, and backs up none of it with fact."
5,Just like the description,The book came in brand new in a decent amount of time. No problems with this seller
5,My wife loves it,"I ordered this for my wife thinking it was Pablo Perez and Friends who made ""He is Magnificent"", a worship cd. I personally was disappointed it wasn't buy my wife and kids were delighted with it and danced in the kitchen for an hour. This one is very upbeat and light. Ok, I like it, too!"
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"What a waste of my time. I bought the book in hopes of reading a realistic view on both the Bangel and Spuffy relationships and what I got was a completely misinterputed and bias view. Bangel: The relationship that was always portrayed as the sweet romantic love was transformed into the relationship that held the HEAT, while Spuffy: The relationship that not only held romance but also the burning hot sexual energy was transformed into the relationship that was ""Calm and stable"". I couldn't believe that the writer was so out of touch with these characters and the Bangel/Spuffy romances.I don't plan to read anymore of this author's work.."
1,A travesty.,"I feel uncomfortable giving this book 1 star. It's a complete travesty and an affront to those of us who actually watch, enjoy and understand both BtVS and AtS.As a Buffy/Spike shipper this was hard for me to get through. As one who also very much enjoyed Buffy and Angel together it was nearly impossible.BOTH relationships were completely misconstrued and trivialized and frankly, some of the dialogue is just embarassing.This is the first Buffyverse novel I've bought and it's put me off buying any more."
4,Pretty good,Okay i liked it. Thought it really showed how much Buffy and Angel still care about each other. I thought Connor and Anya made a cool team.Okay it was funny to me that those two would ever be a team it seemed unlikley but yet it was done and pretty good too. Okay but ther was some boring parts of the book where it would be confusing and have other characters(not the main)in it by themselves for long periods of borringness. I don't think she needed to make the book that big. It would have been better if sh cut out or at least shortened some of those parts. But over all i liked it. Except not enough Spike even though i'm a real Bangel fan i love him.
1,REALLY DISAPPOINTED!,I was hoping to see some progression in the Whedonverse books now that the show had ended. But all it did was revisit The Angel/Buffy relationship. And personally I never found that Buffy and Angel's relationship was about the HEAT so much as it was about the bittersweetness of first love and first heartbreak. So much of the book just fell flat to me. I bought this book in hopes of reading a mature representation of the realtionships as they are now.. not 4 years ago. And I was greatly disappointed.PS: I'm not a huge shipper. But it seems the only cencorship going on here is the Bangel fans not wanting the the other fans who buy this book to speak their minds about it because the book happens to portray their chosen couple in a favorable way. They are showing their distaste by bringing up things about Spuffy in season 6 that have nothing to do with this book at all as a way to strike back at those fans.
1,Bored now.,I read this book right after Shattered Twilight (which was excellent) and maybe that's why it seemed so dull but I was bored from the start.Heat makes the same mistake Monster Island did: too many characters from Jossverse in the same book. Cursed and Seven Crows are examples of novels that handled crossovers well and that's because the writers focused on a couple of the characters instead of trying to cram them all in. Heat jumps around in time and location in a jarring way and it's easy to loose track of the story.(...)
4,The Book Itself,"I thought Nancy Holder did an excellent job in writing this novel. It is written well and adheres to the Buffy and Angel universe perfectly. People out there, reading this book SHOULDN'T flame the writer based on their own opinions and beliefs. That is childish and spiteful. The author worked hard and deserves readers' respect even though you might not necessarily agree with her."
1,Not my cup of tea,"A lot of reviewers have touched no why I didn't like the book: the weak plot, poor pacing, B/A romance, so I'll just add my two cents and say it was a disappointing book and I hope Nancy does better next time."
1,Disappointing,"As an avid reader and a fan of both ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"", I was deeply disappointed in this book. ""Star Trek"" has maintained an active fan base partially because of the high quality of novels. I hoped that with the Buffyverse coming to an end, we would find the same quality in this novel.I was very disappointed to realize that ""Heat"" is nothing more than the same stagnant material from several seasons ago. This book is just a retread of stuff that became boring in Season 3 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""Hopefully, new books will be released soon with new authors and fresh ideas. Nancy Holder is a good writer, but apparently she cannot get beyond the first 3 seasons of ""Buffy""."
2,Very bland,"I bought ""Heat"" hoping to find the same type of story that I loved of the ""Angel"" TV Series. I found the story to be very bland and blah. ""Angel"" was my favorite show of all time, but ""Heat"" did not capture any of the excitement that I miss in the show. I just couldn't get into at all and was barely able to finish reading it.I have never watched ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" so I was very unfamiliar with the characters. Crossover books don't work well for people who only watched one show.I will try reading one of the books that focuses more on ""Angel"" next time.Different people love different things and have different tastes. Obviously a lot of people loved ""Heat"", but it just isn't the type of book that I enjoy reading."
1,From a non-shipper point of view,"As a non-shipper, I found ""Heat"" to be very dull and filled with errors. Nancy Holder keeps the characters and stories stagnant and boring. She completely ignores 4 years of character growth and development. This book is nothing but teenaged romantic drivel that I find completely boring and annoying. The so called story is completely overshadowed by the mushy nonsense. The Buffyverse should be about more than that.Besides, Samurai are a part of Japanese culture, not Chinese. A minimum amount of research would have prevented that error."
1,What show were you watching Nancy???,"I bought this book because I thought it would be about the adult Buffy of season 7 and Angel of season 4. I was so disappointed by this book. Buffy and Angel had both moved on to more adult relationships. It seems that Nancy Holder stopped watching ""Buffy"" after season three. Nancy, if you read this review please only write Buffy stories set during seasons 1-3 and let some one who has watched the entire series write the later season.This book was awful."
2,Meh,"Now that the series has ended, I was hoping for a progression of the story, but that's not what we got. Back to the sugar sweet 'first wuv 4eva' Buffy and Angel stuff. Did I miss something? Last I heard, Buffy loved Spike. I liked 'Blood and Fog', 'These our Actors', and that one with Spike and Angel whose title escapes me at the moment, but this book was a disappointment. I realize continuity must be a problem when writing stories based on TV shows that have huge attendant mythologies, but for a book to blatantly ignore established series canon (both BtVS and AtS) is a turn-off for me. Nancy Holder is a good writer, but I hope she sticks more to what made me love the TV shows if she writes any more Buffy books."
1,GOOD BOOK BAD ENDING,"I loved this book as I was reading it. It had lots of action, and it was just generally a good read. And then I came to the end. This book has the worst ending I have ever read. As such I highly reccomend you do not waste your time, you will be disappointed."
2,Torn,"Here's the deal: I'm a big Buffy/Spike fan and have wanted them to get together since season 5 and I really loved their interaction. Buffy and Spike's romance doesn't ""heat"" up until mid-season 7 and this book is set early in the year, when Buffy's still dealing with the New and Improved Spike! So, all the Sunnydale stuff was great; I give it 4 ****The problem was I don't watch Angel and when the book started delving into the lives of the characters on that show I zoned out. By the time the book ended I had ""zoned"" out so much I felt like I missed a major part of the story. The LA story gets no *s and that's why my review averaged 2 **.I honestly can't comment on how Holder handles the Angel stuff but the BtVS stuff is good."
1,What a waste of trees,"This book is awful. It reads as if it was written by a twelve year old bad fanfiction writer. Holder has no understanding of the characters whatsoever, and the plot is nonexistant. I can only hope Holder is assigned some other Fox owned creation to do her painfully bad writing in from now on."
5,"Very Good book and a ""Must have"" for Buffy/Angel fans","I really enjoyed the book. The Buffy/Angel romance is frequently mentioned and the ""Buffyverse"" characters are written well. The story was a little hard to follow as there is an over abundance of characters in the book. Although I preferred the story line in "" Monster Island"", this book really soothed my Buffy/Angel heart. I only wish that they would write these for an adult market instead of the teen market."
5,Petty tantrums do not equal a review.,"This is as fine a selection as any in the tie-in series. In fact, it's the first one I've purchased in several years, based on a reading of a friend's copy.Buffy and Angel have always been important in one another's lives, no matter what temporary infatuations passed through them. Ms. Holder does a great job of bringing the plotlines together, and spins a wonderful yarn, as usual.And to all the children who whinged and called it ""reviewing""? Shame on you. Are you aware that these writers are guided BY THE PUBLISHERS? And you're slamming an author's work for something that isn't even her decision.Keep up the great work, Nancy. And rest assured, publishers, that I will continue to purchase products that are skewed toward *the title characters of the series*, rather than secondary, far less important ones."
2,Slow read,"I have read a lot of Buffy and Angel book. This one is just so SLOW. I am ready to give up. Usually I can polish a buffy book over a weekend. This one last five days, and I am barely half way through.Granted, some of the dialogue is ok, and have some inside jokes about people on the show are cute.But, the problem is the story is just not moving from chapter to chapter. The villians are not very interesting. Too many non-essential characters running in and out story with nothing to add the story.Skip this book unless you have problem falling asleep at night."
4,Good Read,"Heat was very enjoyable and it kept me wanting more. I'm glad, Heat was my first Buffyverse book purchase...no regrets whatsoever. I thought all the characters were treated fairly (including all the ships). Only criticism...even though the villains history were important in understanding the storyline, I felt that it dragged a tiny bit in the beginning of the book. All and all, this book was a fun read."
1,Not very good...,"Ok..I love Nacy's books! And for me to be puting this down is really not like me.. I love Spike from 'Buffy' and have been a huge fan of everything the comes from 'Buffy'. And this book was s'pose to discribe the Spike and Buffy relationship, and well, frankly, didn't do a very good job. Spike and Buffy's relationship was full of lustful passion and this book had more of Buffy thinking of Angel then Spike in anyway. I am just dissapointed...Im very sorry, and I hope Nacy's other books she comes up with will be better. If your a fan like me, check out one her books called 'Blood and Fog' Its much better!~GL"
1,Get over it!,"Unfortunately this book takes us back to the bad old days of the ooey gooey ""romance"" between the 250-year old Angel and his widdle Buffy -- the girl he abandoned ""for her own good"" five years ago. Joss Whedon got over it, I got over it, and so should the folks who publish these books. I know Nancy Holder can do better than this. Can we please see some adult Buffy, with adult relationships, instead of continuing to extend this juvenile pairing well past its sell-by date?"
3,It was Decent,"I am one of those weird people who is a B/A, B/S or C/A fan so I think I can be objective. The story line was good, however much of the dialogue was corny and di not seem to fit the characters sometimes. I do think that Nancey should have left out a few characters because they just caused problems with the storyline. But overall I enjoyed reading ""Heat"" and enjoyed the moments between Buffy and Angel (when they were too corny). I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a B/A fan."
3,Keys work but fit is not accurate,"Purchased this set of keys for 1988 and 1990 Yamaha Waverunners, the lanyard material and quality is good. Plastic of the keys is as good as OEM, the problem is this keys are a bit too thick. The YAMAHA key was unusable due to the thickness but fortunately there was another key on there that worked. The problem is they don't yank of the kill switch easily, you have to pull REALLY hard. We did fall off each one of the waverunners and both times the key remain attached on both ends flipping the PWC over. I had to yank it off by tugging at it pretty hard. All in all its better than illegaly riding with a zip tie attached and watching your jet ski drive away while you swim for it against the current LOL"
4,Nice christmas compilation,"I dont understand people's tiffs on here with Avril Lavigne. Whats up with this ""TONE DEAF"" stuff?I think she is an amazing artist. And, having a very dynamic musician such as Chantal to be by her side makes the song even better to listen to.The Be Good Tanyas song was really well done, as was Six Pense Non The Richer, and Martina Sorbara. The others were quite good too.The only one I didnt enjoy so much was Lisa Hannigan. Christmas is supposed to be joyful... not depressing."
2,Even more Hit and Miss than the Previous One,"I'll quick this simple. There are two gems on this collection: ""Spotlight On Christmas"" by Rufus Wainwright and ""Donde Esta Santa Claus?"" by Guster. Sixpence None The Richer's ""It Came Upon A Midnight Clear"" is also enjoyable enough due to Leigh Nash's patented vocals."
3,Carolers are at my door. Don't wanna hear them anymore.,"This sequel toMaybe This Christmasfeatures (mostly) alt-rock performers doing Christmas songs. It features an about even mix of older Christmas songs and new ones. The very best performances here are of the very oldest songs, especially ""O Holy Night"" by Avril Lavigne & Chantel Kreviazuk, ""Go Tell It on the Mountain"" by Oh Susanna and ""It Came Upon a Midnight Clear"" by Sixpence None the Richer. The new songs aren't really all that memorable, generally speaking, although ""Green Christmas"" by Barenaked Ladies is good. Cute cover, though. Consider this to be a lukewarm review."
5,Comment worth repeating...,"Passed on to me from a friend were these powerful comments about THE MARY MAGDALENE WITHIN from Michael Joseph, author of THIS IS HEAVEN CALLING EARTH: DIALOGS WITH DIANA: ""I showed your illuminating book to one of England's leading scholars of the Ancient Wisdom, and he immediately replied: ""What has never even been considered is that the Magdalene WAS the Christ consciousness all those years ago, and initiated Jesus into it!"" A 'Sun of God' means one who has been initiated by the Priestess of God (or Godess, in fact) into becoming a being of Light! SHE fills him with Light - not the other way round! What a tragedy that women have been forced to play a subservient role in the affairs of the world, thanks to the machinations of the powers-that-be... THE MARY MAGDALENE WITHIN will do much to right this great injustice."""
4,This dish soap even gets the approval of the man of the house!,"I have been using this dish soap for only a few days; however, here are my preliminary findings.Pros:1: It keeps its suds on the sponge longer than any other dish soap I've ever used--meaning I use less soap for each sink of dishes.2: The scent is very light, but pleasant. My fiance, who cannot handle any types of perfumes, says it is nice and much better than Joy lemon scent which we've been using for years.3: It does not leave a lingering fragrance in the air.Cons:1: It is indeed an awkward bottle to handle with wet hands.2: It is difficult to tell by glancing at it if the top is open.Overall, I am very pleased with the soap so far. I am very happy to finally be able to use an environmentally friendly dish soap which is also quite functional as well."
5,A parent's point of view.,"As a parent of a toddler, we are challenged to teach many new skills. ""Let's Move Together,"" provides lots of suggestions for just that. This is a valuable book to refer to in time of transition. The beautiful pictures and concise words are great for children to relate to."
4,Suggestion to Author,"The book was an enjoyable read, but I have to say that I have one gripe with the book. The author presents logic questions throughout the book and later presents the answers. Some of the questions were quite long. For long questions, rather than reprinting the entire question when the answers were presented, he would print just the first few words. I was constantly flipping back through the book trying to find the full question...which some of the questions were rather hard to find. It wasted a lot of time for something that could have been solved by simply giving the page number of the original question."
3,Accuracy,"I am puzzled about what to think. The book starts off with several interview or puzzle questions. However, some of the given answers are correct, some answers are hard and unreasonable ways to solve the problem, and some are flat wrong. Now I haven't reviewed the whole book and I was looking forward to Mr. Poundstones other works. However, I now do so with caution. I don't have faith that the info and results he gives are correct. And one needs that faith if one is going to try to learn about things one doesn't understand. Simply put, this book has failed a small scrutiny test. That doesn't make it all wrong. But if you expect all the answers given to be correct or reasonable, that would be a mistake."
4,Not Just for Tech-Heads,"This book should not be pigeon-holed as something only Microsoft junkies or the technologically-inclined should read. The author has fascinating chapters not just on the ostensible subject of the book: the trend-setting job interview methods Bill Gates' behemoth that the rest of the industry has copied since. He also looks into the IQ test fad, the importance of puzzles as creative outlet as well as their over-hyped ability to snag high-quality employees for companies.The centerpiece of the book, naturally, are the pages of brain-teasers and logic games that purportedly play such a central role in Microsoft's hiring process. They are fun and not too demanding (no need for advanced mathematics skills, although they would be helpful). Overall a pleasant breezy read that shouldn't take more than a day or two to complete."
3,"Interesting, but not altogether relevant","As someone currently interviewing at MS, I was interested in reading several of the books on the subject, and someone recommended this one. The content focus is spread between historical data on various management styles and use of puzzles in interviews, and many of the now famous brain-teasers once used at MS. This wasn't exactly what i was hoping to read - it would have been nice to get more of an insight into other aspects of their hiring practices, because puzzles are just one little piece of it.I found a much better book for those keen on understand how MS managers think - epsecially when hiring: ""The 12 Simple Secrets of Microsoft Management: How to Think and Act Like a Microsoft Manager and Take Your Company to the Top"" by David Thielen, while positioned as a book for management in other companies, is actually a fantastic resource for people interviewing - or hoping to interview."
3,"Entertaining and Anecdotal, but not super informative.","This book was entertaining because it contained great anecdotes and history about the puzzle-based interview.Apart from that, however, I found it quite unoriginal. If you're interested in learning how to hire great people, go search the JoelOnSoftware website for interviewing tips. There's an essay there which is cited several times in this book.If you're a puzzle enthusiast, you've probably heard many of the puzzles in this book. As the author mentions, there are plenty of online resources for this information.This book devotes too much time to talking about msft and it seems like the author is locked in a love/hate relationship with that company. :)Overall, this book was a collection of many sources of information (anecdotes about msft, recruiting tips from Joel, puzzles from the web) without adding much originality (except maybe the 'answers' section)."
3,great book,"when i bought this book i didnt expect it to be solely about microsoft and their hiring puzzle questions, but all in all its still interesting."
4,Wonderful read,Really a nice way of hiring people for a company like Microsoft who believe in changing the world.I enjoyed the book and learnt how to deal with problems in an interview.
1,Not good for preparing any interview,"This book was a disappointment. It consists of a few anecdotes about William Shockley and Microsoft people, and does not offer any insights into the questions asked, or how to solve them. It is not any significant research into the puzzle questions in job interviews. Nor is it an original collection of brainteasers. It is written in the style of a very long Sunday magazine, and not a book. For a job seeker who might be faced with logic and puzzle interviews this book has very little to offer. It can actually be detrimental, because it gives a feeling of intimidation, and not revelation."
2,Didn't see any of these at Microsoft interview,"These questions may be interesting, but not if you are looking for any clue of what Microsoft is currently asking interviewees. Many of the puzzles and answers can be found online. My recommendation is to look at ""Ace the IT Interview"" for interview guidelines."
3,"interesting, but not altogether relevant","As someone currently interviewing at MS, I was interested in reading several of the books on the subject, and someone recommended this one.

3,Not good for interviewing,"This book is definitely entertaining, interesting, and well-researched. However, the premise is a little misleading. I bought this as I was finishing grad school and interviewing with tech companies. It really did not help at all. Maybe companies used to use these logic puzzles, but regardless, I can tell you for sure they don't anymore. I interviewed with companies including Google, Apple, Amazon, and Adobe, and none of them asked me any logic puzzles. I don't think it's common practice anymore. Don't buy this if you're looking to get ahead for tech interviews. Your time would be better spent studying programming problems."
1,Deprecated,"Went through microsoft interview successfully. They don't ask these questions anymore, was a useless read. These questions accroding to MS were not getting the best people. All my questions were programming/algorithmic problems"
5,Good for interview backup,"This was a pretty fun read. The book goes over the origins of brainteaser/puzzle interviews, how they are/should be used, and has a lot of well explained examples. For my purposes of going over brainteasers that I might run into in investment banking interviews, the book was pretty handy because the few brainteasers I did get, I had read about before. If you are trying to do the same thing for other types of interviews (with trading companies or something more quantitative) then the book isn't as good in those areas, because the questions are more probability/stat based.Overall, very enjoyable and well-written."
5,Innovación,"Simplemente eso es este libro ... innovación. Si necesitan un libro para aprender a atar, esto es no la mejor opción. Si desean un libro que abra la puerta en forma clara, concisa y novedosa, recomiendo 110% que adquieran este título. Lo brillante es todo aquello relativo a foam y su mezcla con materiales tradicionales. Gran libro de Steeves."
2,Wasn't expecting an edited XXX but...,"Guess I should have payed closer attention to the details. Several really cute girls but would rather have seen them getting it on together rather than with guys. Thank goodness, no full frontal male nudity and no shots of actual penetration."
5,Terrific follow up to LOST HOLLYWOOD,"Wallace has reinvented Hollywood history books by ecscavating its ruins to make it new and once again undeniably glamorous, scandolous and absurd. It's one of those things, those books, that you look through again thinking, of course, of course this had to be written, and all the while feeling as though you couldn't have imagined it before you read it the first time."
2,Inaccuracyland,"Despite Mr. Wallace's avowed claim to find the ""truth behind the anecdotes,"" this book--just like his first on the subject (Lost Hollywood)--is nothing more than a series of mostly unsubtantiated Hollywood myths coupled with outright inaccuracies (e.g., Mr. Wallace indicates Jean Harlow as being the recipient of James Cagney's grapefruit-in-the-face in the famous ""Public Enemy"" scene--when, in fact, it was Mae Clarke), held together by numerous misspellings and typos. Only for the desperate! The dust jacket is nice, though."
1,Great Title; Poor content,"It's disappointing that not one, but two books by this author, filled with inaccuracies, could find their way to publication. A glance through the chapter about Blondes relates the tired Jean Harlow/Christian Science/Evil Mother Jean story that first appeared in Irving Shulman's 1964 best selling, but totally made-up HARLOW, AN INTIMATE BIOGRAPHY. Mr. Wallace apparently missed both the excellent David Stenn and Eve Golden bios of Jean Harlow that were written in the early 1990's, which refute that legend based on hospital records and other 'minor' facts, etc.If you are in the mood for salacious gossip unrooted in reality, read Kenneth Anger's books; they are 'classics' of this genre that will leave you howling and hungry for more, unlike copycats like HOLLYWOODLAND, which reminds one of stale bread."
1,Hollywoodland misfires,"While I believe Mr. Wallace is earnest, he is often inaccurate or incomplete. His chapters are thumbnail sketches based on rumor and his subject matter from the fictious life of a Hollywood [hopeful] to the fashion designers is pure fluff. How can you have a chapter on Hollywood fashion and not even mention Edith Head? Even an interesting chapter on one of the first African-American architects is made dull in Wallace's hands. The re-tread of old deaths like Thelma Todd and Paul Bern reads like a transcript of a conversation in a beauty salon. There is neither nuance in his writing nor sustenance to keep a reader turning pages. For true Hollywood history buffs, save your money. If you must read all you can on Hollywood, I suggest checking out your local library."
3,not bad,"FOR those who really want to understand Hollywood,I would suggest a much greater book on the subject,a book about the town and the industry more than thescandals. IT's HOLLYWOOD REMEMBERED by Paul Zollo.I highly recommend it.JF"
4,Hollywood History,"""Hollywoodland"" has alot of stories about the early history of Hollywood and the movie business. It goes into alot of the gossip and myths surrounding the start of film. I think it is a good book for anyone who wants a good overview of this. I don't think it was very well written. But if you are looking for an easy start to learning about Hollywood history, this would be a good book."
5,Hollywoodland,"A good historical account of the formation of Hollywood and the movie business. It follows ""Lost Hollywood"" which depicts the founding of the area that has become known as ""Hollywood"" and how the movie business rose. The book also details the people involved, including movie stars. the book is well written, interesting and not overly fact-laidened."
2,"Fun, but flawed: might work better as a juvenile, but...","I happened to see this on the shelf at the library and the initial premise caught my eye and made me take it home. And the book *is* fun - after all, who wouldn't like dirt-cheap interstellar travel, and the image of a pickup truck as a mini-starship was a blast. The places the protagonist visits are just about all friendly and welcoming, which kind of gave the book a kid's story feeling, something I might recommend to an avid 12-year-old reader. However, the authors distaste, and perhaps even hatred for his own country tainted the book for me beyond repair - in the story, the only real villain is the United States. I don't understand why Oltion feels this way - judging by the number of books and short stories he's published he's doing reasonably well for himself. Maybe its something in the water in Eugene? Bottom line: a fun way to spend an afternoon, but don't give it to anyone young and impressionable."
2,legendary irish tenors,I can only find one cd in the order received today thi is not as advertised on the net please send cd 2 asadvertised and oblige astonished thank you john kenny
5,Best Permaculture Film,-very motivational shows what can be done by combining Aquaponics with sustainability to inspire the imagination. Very easy to view and comprehend
4,Bluegrass for the new generation!,"This is the first album released by the GrooveGrass Boyz band started by music producer Scott Rouse.It features blues veterans as Doc Watson,Mac Wiseman and such.Funk artist Bootsy Collins even swings by in a couple songs.Now myself,I don't hate bluegrass,but it isn't my thing,but this album is a perfect mix of bluegrass,rockabilly and country dance songs.I love it!If you like this album,also check out the GrooveGrass Boyz second and last album(but not last single) ""GrooveGrass 101"""
4,Beautiful music,"The music itself is very beautiful, but I am not sure all of the songs chosen could be called ""Irish Hymns."""
1,A pathetic performance of wonderful music,I suppose this is the only way we have to know this wonderfurl music by Marianna Martinez; but i wonder if it is really possitive in a so bad performance and in a so bad recording.
4,"Sporty and Appealing, but not Outstanding","I have only tried the small sample sizes for Vetiver, after hearing high compliments concerning this cologne: but I was somewhat let down actually. Yes, it has fruity notes intermixed with spices, that is very pleasant... but there was nothing unusual about this fragrance that would make it stand out against similar scents from R.L. Black, R.L. Blue, ""Man"" from Calvin Klein, and many others. Yes, it it good, very good, but I don't think it is extraordinary; though my four stars may be unnecessarily tough."
5,The real thing,"This item is 100% authentic, I have bought CREED products for 20 years and I do know what is real and fake. This is real> I will buy from you again"
2,DUBIOUS,"WHATS WRONG WITH THIS ORDER?PRODUCT WAS NOT FACTORY WRAPPED WHICH UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION THERE WAS NO BAR CODE TO BE FOUND. ALSO BOTTLE CAP DIDN'T FIT SECURLY. THE PRODUCT DID NOT HAVE A LASTING SCENT; COMPARED TO PRODUCT IN SAKS WHICH LASTED FOR UP TO THREE DAYS... I DONT' WANT TO IMPUNE THE INTEGRITY OF THE SHIPPER, HOWEVER I WAS DISAPOINTED AND UPON OPENING THE PACKAGE CONTENTS I WAS REMINDED OF A ""CANAL ST."" DEBACLE."
1,Not the Original One!!!,I am very disapointed about the product. I have bought the original vetiver before. This product smelled so different! I am sure it is not the original!!
3,Creed Original Vetiver by Creed for Men - 1.0 oz Millesime Spray,"My third Creed cologne and not really liking it. Smells soapy and flowery to me, I know everone is different but this is in no way a masculine scent to me. I own Aventus and that is masculine. Glad I bought the 1oz version. I would like to sample a different bottle just to make sure mine is authentic and not a fugasi so to speak.Seems my opinion is different than the other reviewers here. Hope I got the real deal...."
5,Great Sibelius Warhorses,"I have to assume that this CD simply was not sold in too many places. Charles Mackerras is a world class conductor and the Royal Philharmonic is a great orchestra. And this CD had a very low price. But this is the first review. Strange. Nevertheless, these are very great performances. And at the low price, you simply cannot beat it."
2,"Good design, poor quality, misleading ad","The design for this item is excellent! BUT it stops there. Item is made from lighter than desired steel, built in China. ( tagged as such). Welds are sloppy and I had to redo two of them so I would feel safe using the product.Their ad states that it will accommodate many brands of saws and it probably will AFTER you build a wooden frame to go under your saw to bring it to the correct height. They do not mention that and lead you to believe this it ready to use. IT IS NOT! And the hardware provided to do this inadequate.Shipping was very slow. Be prepared to wait! It took four weeks and an angry e-mail to get it shipped a distance of three states.Like I stated above, the design is excellent but the execution is poor. If you are handy with tools, can weld, and are willing to wait, is worth taking a chance."
5,Brilliant! A Must Read for All Medical Students.,"Dr. Bernstein, one of the most accomplished teachers (and practitioners) of orthopedic medicine, has amassed a very useful and insightful text on musculoskeletal medicine. It is the first of its kind; before its publication and widespread adoption by medical schools this year, medical education only encompassed a high-level overview of orthopedics. This book is indispensable to any medical education; indeed, medical training without this invaluable resource is incomplete. Consumers who are interested in the subject of orthopedics and sports medicine will also find this book to be truly accessible and a welcome addition to their bookshelves.One more word: Dr. Bernstein, a professor of orthopedics at a well respected medical school, isn't just interested in theory. His text is written in an cheerful manner and blooms with useful diagnostic information that makes his subject come to life.Buy it!"
5,Clever story,"This superb Christmas picture book deserves a rediscovery! In understatedly witty text, it tells the story of Delver mole, a young mole who lives underground and knows nothing of Christmas. One day he hears about it from a mouse, and wonders if this ""fat man in a red suit"" will bring him his dearest wish - a telescope so that he can see the stars. (Being very nearsighted as most moles are, he has never seen them.) Risking the peril of facing the local owl, Delver and his family build an above-ground chimney and leave a letter for Santa. They then fall asleep waiting on Christmas eve in the open, and are about to be snatched up by the owl when, in a curious and believable way, the owl finds some Christmas spirit and is duly rewarded by Santa, who also brings the telescope for Delever. The illustrations are memorable and the story is a complete charmer. Highly recommened for kids preschool through grade 2."
5,A terrific Christmas book,"This picture book is my favorite ""animal"" Christmas book. The drawings and narrative are both charming and the story is not sacharine, but,in the best sense, heart-warming."
3,Skin Brush,"This brush is quite stiff, good for feet and calves. I had to buy a softer brush for other parts of my body."
1,crap,"Fell apart almost immediately and it was past the time I could return it. Very disappointing. I mean, very very."
4,Soak it before you use it!!,"I was looking for a stiff brush and wow did I find it. If STRONGLY suggest you give the bristles a serious soak before using it for the first time, then again before each use. If not, just get yourself a porcupine and a stick to use at your next bath. I tried to use it right of he box and scrubbed my arm raw on the first swipe. Once soaked, it did a great job."
5,Firmer Bristles for Good Cleaning,"It is hard to find a good shower brush that really scrubs your back. I have oily skin and need to brush with firm bristles. Most back brushes have fine, soft bristles that hardly do anything at all. This one does the job and I highly recommend it!The only problem with it is that the handle slides into a slot on the back of the brush, and the brush falls off every day when it is hanging in the shower. Every morning I have to slide the handle back into the slot, but no matter how well it seems to be attached it is off again the next morning. I would prefer that it be permanently affixed to the handle. As it is, I may use wood glue to attach it and hope that it stops coming off."
4,Is as described.,I read other's feedback about it being able to be used in the shower. I don't agree. It's already warping; the wood has no finish that I can discern. Others also believe the bristles to be quite firm. As a serious exfoliater I don't agree. I want a shower brush with a detachable handle that really scrubs... this is not it. That isn't to say that this is not exactly what it is supposed to be though; this is a great dry brush that seems to be well made.
5,Great addition to the garage,We got this to connect to the plan city garage. It is nice quality and seems very durable. My 2.5 has no issued connecting the pieces. Plan to keep adding with other Plan City items
5,Flexible Quality,"I bought my 8200s to hook up to my computer to play DVDs - and does it ever! I used to run the sound through my portable stereo, and never missed the full bass effects, stereo that makes you turn your head to look for the source, and a clear crisp sound throughout.I also play my MP3 collection all day long, playing classical, sacred, oldies, kid's song, all sounding great. I especially like a satellite system from an aesthetics point of view, too."
2,Speakers Don't Last,"I bought this system over a year ago and the two front speakers blew out after about 3 months. The receiver and sub are great. I mean a 100 Watt sub for a computer. If you have speakers to replace the others once they go, get this, otherwise, be more reasonable and test some systems out before you buy it."
2,Not my favorite intrepretation of Chopin,"I love Chopin, but I am not a musician myself. I was really shocked to discover that there is a really different sound when one pianist or another plays the exact same piece. This fellow W Kappell has a very disctinct style, very clanging and harsh i thought. Im afraid i dont like it at all, but like i said, im no musician. I much prefer the Favourite Chopin 2cd set i just found at the library featuring pianist: Vladimir Ashkenazy."
3,"Great band, normal album","This is the second album by Los Chicharrons and allthough it's quite good it is nothing compared to their last record ""When the Sun Goes Down"". I first bought the last album and this one has come as quite a dissapointment, I think it's more the sort of easy music for dancing than the complex music you find in ""when the sun goes down"" . It has some good tracks though, if you've never heard of los chicharrons and are going to buy just one album I would recommend the later, but bear in mind tha ALL Los Chicharrons albums are a must_have for anyone really interest in music"
5,Great follow up!,"The score to Evil Dead 2 is as fun and scary as the film it self. A little short, running only 34 min. , but still a must have for any film score library. Hearing this score brings back fond memories of an excellent piece of work."
1,Says 2PK but you only get one,"I thought I was getting a good deal, because it said 2/PK and I thought I was getting a good deal but it is only one battery and if look for a sale you can get the dewalt orignal for the same amount so why go to second tier."
4,Take another listen--this album has a lot to offer,"I disagree with the previous review of this album--Hors de Combat is an extremely diverse and interesting album, and though not typical post rock, is a blend of old and new styles bringing a completely original angle to the ground work laid by seminal post rock bands. The album is driving, with an incredible amount of forward movement. By the time the cd has ended you literally don't know how you got there--in a good way. While listening to the album you might not realize how far each track is taking you until you reach the end; if you were to listen to the first and last track of the album back-to-back you would never guess that Kalpana was the creator of both pieces, yet the songs laid between the two make sense and create a cohesive, amazing bridge from beginning to end. The album is a rare accomplishment in both sequence and form, not to mention musical originality. This band thinks out of the box--it's refreshing, exciting, and well done."
2,reviews lie this time,"I read a couple reviews of the disc in indie mags and they were very positive so i bought the disc (luckily it was cheap). They compared them to great post-rock bands and i could not resist. Folks, this is middle of the road at best. Nothing grabs you or makes you want to keep listening and therein lies the problem. Post-Rock music has to be gripping and moving because they rarely rely on vocals. This just doesn't get there. High hopes may have made this less enjoyable, but i can't really recommend it to YOU."
1,Be carefull!,"how it's posssible to buy an album withoout knowing anything about: edition, year, performers and so on? You should be more carefully in offering such an item!"
2,Looking for photos in all the wrong places!,"I bought this book as a gift for my daughter, who loves the milk moustache ads and tears them out of magazines, etc. I was disappointed when I saw it. I expected a collection of photos of the various ads, which she would have loved; however, there were very few of them. The book focuses on the marketing and advertising strategies of their campaign. If that's what you're looking for, it's your cup of tea. Hopefully she'll like it anyway. It's too bad Amazon can't find a way that we can flip through the pages, as we would in a book store, to get a better idea of the contents."
1,No Mustache Ads Found Here!,I asked my mom to get this book for me because I thought it would have a collection of all of the great milk mustache celebrity ads. But it doesn't have any. This book is about some regional ad campaign from California. I wish the description had made that more clear.
1,You call this an ad?,"HELLO? I was like THRILLED to see this book here- I thought it'd be the whole collection (or at least most) in the book! (No writing, probably just a paragraph) just like how I see them in magazines! I collect the posters too, so I was REaLLY dissapointed to find that the book was filled with information on the milk stuff but only a few posters! Please, AMAZOn, you should seriously show out a few pages of books so we could get to know the book better!"
1,No milk mustache ads found here.,I asked my mother to get this book because I thought it would have milk mustache ads in it. It doesn't have any!
1,Incredible,"The only drawback about democracy is that any idiot can write anything and claim that it represents the truth. You would have to take a lot of quotes out of context, misrepresent a lot of history, make up some facts, ignore others, and basically have intellectual ability of a chipmunk to come up with conclusions like this author has."
1,Good grief!,"This book blames Israel for 9/11. Here's a quote from the bookstore page of Dandelion Books.Twelve months of careful study, painstaking research, source verification leading to ""the only logical conclusion that the 9-11 attacks and numerous other foiled terror plots, were planned, orchestrated, financed, carried out, and covered up by the forces of international Zionism.""Uh huh. Next.This is utter madness, well spiced by Satanic bigotry. Don't waste your money."
1,Technically Brilliant-- but not Emotionally,"Sorry. That should be three stars above.This is a great work --so powerful you can almost see Pagnini's battle between good and evil brought out by Rachmaninoff. (It was rumored he had a pact with the Devil to play so well).It doesn't come across for me in this recording.There is technical brilliance here. Amazing finger work of incredible speed. But I find it empty of both the darker, threatening visage from the orchestra and the sweet moment of love that tries to 'save' the music's decent into darkness.Yet our other reviewer from South America finds it outstanding. I agree with the first reviewer-- not enough.That love song on Track 19 should lift the listener to a sigh of aching joy and relief from dancing madness. It is among the greatest ever written. It deserves emotion as well as brilliance."
3,Excellent prose but...,"I highly commend Kate Grenville for her artistic writing talent. I greatly appreciated the way she crafted the story - putting together sentences that spoke directly to me as experiences I have had but could never have put so beautifully into words. I found the writing and main plot profoundly enjoyable and I would venture to guess that most readers would recognize a bit of themselves in any one of the main characters.The only drawback for me was the subplot of the housewife and the butcher - I understand the psychology behind it relative to the title of the book but for the same reasons I don't watch Desperate Housewives - I uncomfortably skimmed over those pages.Sorry Kate, not a prude, just thought it took away from the beauty of the main story. I prefer some things left to my imagination."
2,not to my liking,"Didn't care for it. I just didn't find it that interesting. Nor do I feel she had some great epiphany or philosophy to share. The whole book seemed to be about her trying to figure out why she was so accident prone. Was it because she was left handed? Her mother drank Gin while pregnant with her,fate, karma, a secret death wish what.. .. and on and on and on. And what was up with those mysterious monthly phone calls from Edward Albert.. I am sorry I just didn't get it, found it very slow moving and found myself fast forwarding often.. I was suprised by all the rave reviews."
2,Very jumpy,I read a lot of memoirs and this one was very scattered. I couldn't keep track of where the author was a lot of the time. She grew up in many different places and she must have adopted that way of being--because that has become her writing style. I thought the cover looked good; but in this case 'don't judge a book by its cover.'
4,High quality at a fair price,"The dimensions of this cookie/jelly roll pan are 18"" x 13"" x 1."" Note that these pans are the non-coated variety. They are sturdy and live up to the Chicago Metallic name. One of the two I received has a small dent in it, and I have had this happen on one other occasion with Chicago Metallic Commercial pans that came in a set of two. I decided to keep the dented pan and it has not caused any difficulties in using it to bake cookies or roast vegetables or meats."
2,Not as happy as I hoped!,"Chicago Metallic Commercial Cookie/Jelly Roll Pans, Set of 2The two pans are obviously packed together and when I opened the box, the top pan looked fine. However, when I separated the two, the pan on the bottom was dented on the two long sides. Consequently, when I use it, if there is any liquid, it pools. Guess I should have just gone to a store and avoided shipping."
3,These mid-price pans are solid but lose their nonstick coating,"I've used my Chicago Metallic jelly roll pans approximately 20 times now. They are well constructed and don't warp, but the nonstick finish is already coming off, despite extreme caution to never use metal and never wash in the dishwasher. I suppose I will continue to use them with a parchment paper lining, but now - what's the point of paying extra for nonstick?"
1,So disappointed,"After washing these (I bought two) for the first time, I started drying them with a dish towel. Imagine my dismay when the dish towel turned gray as the outer surface of the pan shed aluminium all over the towel. My hands and pot holders turn gray when I hold the pan. Ick! What's getting in my cookies?!"
5,Why did I wait so long?,I finally replaced my old cookie sheets with these commercial grade Jelly roll pans. They are great and easy to clean. -DMD
5,Chicago Metallic,"Chicago Metallic, does one have to say more? It was excellent. I say was because I kind of ruined the surface by harsh scrubbing. Do NOT use a scouring pad. Use it. Let it cool. (If you don't and add water it will warp.) When cool add warm or hot water with dish soap, let it soak until food material is soft, clean with a soft sponge. Also when using cooking spray with very hot cooking, DON'T, it will permenantly stain. Use oil for high temp. such as corn, canola or peanut oil."
5,Charlie,"It's a great book. John McCabe really covered over Chaplin's life. I also learned a lot of new things about Charlie and it made me an even bigger fan. Oh, by the way, look at me, 16 years old and a fan of Charles Spencer Chaplin, lol. Shows anyone and everyone that age simply doesn't matter."
4,Interesting Book,"In my grandaughter's drama class they studied silent films and she loved Charlie Chaplin. Found this book for her. She is thrilled. Lots of information on the silent actor and pictures too. Nice quality book,for used."
4,Too bad it's discontinued,"I have read they are not making this unit anymore - too bad. It does what it's supposed to. Only beef is that there is no documentation on how to open the enclosure.That's the reason I only gave it 4 stars. I found another review online that helped me with that. (It slides open) Aside from the access issue, it works flawlessly, but I shouldn't be telling you this 'cause I'll probably get another one - if there's any left! You even get a nice case with it. Kudos to Beach Audio for fast shipping as well."
3,It is not so bad after all,"The review posted by the anonymous reader from CT seems a little too harsh to me. The book offers a decent overview over many interesting areas of panel data. In particular, one and two way error components are discussed, one chapter is devoted to hypotheses testing, heteroscedasticity and serial correlation and dynamic panel data models respectively. However it is true, that the authour does not provide much help to understand the literature which is just reproduced (often word by word from the papers!). The book is not recommended to someone who wants to read about Panel Data but doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the subject yet."
2,Mistake,"The first sentence of the first comment apparently confuses ""mere"" with ""slight"". Also, his judgement is too harsh. The book definitely deserves two stars."
2,Not updated to current ANSI standard!,"The preface by the author suggests that the second (current) edtion reflects the current ANSI standard.('The sample programs conforms to the ANSI C standard').I found examples where it does not:On page 294, the author states that 'an array within a function MUST be defined as a STATIC array so that it can be initialized'.The are numerous examples which correspond the classic C but not the ANSI C:Exmaples 10.14, 10.12..A statement on page 215: 'automatic arrays can not be initialized"" is not also correct'.The back cover of the book suggests: 'if your goal is better comprehension or top grades. this powerful study tool [...] is the closest thing to a guarantee you will find anywhere'.In fact, if your answers during an exam are based on the examples cited, you are expected to get a lower grade."
4,really good price and works well,"The santuko knife is the best knife I've ever owned. Of course this is because I cannot afford to spend $90 on a knife that I say this. If you want a good semi-precise knife set on a low budget this is pretty good. I do have to sharpen the santuko knife a lot but that is because I use it several times a day and sometimes on a glass cutting board. From what I understand that will dull a knife pretty quickly. Be careful,it's sharp, I've cut my fingers twice with this knife. The smaller knife is great for cutting open a bell pepper. Over all, I like this set. It's getting me though all the healthy home cooking I do. But I'll probably buy something a little higher quality in a couple of years."
5,Chicago Cutlery,"I really like my knife set...it is heavy duty, sharp, one piece, and gets the job done. Not a flimsy blade. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys working with quality utensils."
5,Wont find better for the price,"I've used very expensive knives before and no, these are not as good. But for $15, you really cant do better. They are very sharp and have a nice weight to them. Metal finish makes them easy to clean because its all one piece. Perfect for my needs"
2,A little too psychedelic...,"I really didn't enjoy this DVD at all. I would have preferred if the instructor would have been in a regular yoga studio in the segments, rather than having a digital, moving background placed behind her. I bought this along with another pregnancy yoga DVD and I never use this one. To be honest, it made me naseaus in my first trimester during the morning sickness.It's too bad, because the actual yoga sequences are fine. The format is what makes it so difficult to watch."
3,Yoga for Pregnancy,This DVD is pretty funny and at first I felt silly doing it. But after you get past the graphics and her voice I think it's pretty good and I find it to be very relaxing. I am in my second trimester now and I think when I am in my third trimester I will find it to be very useful in preparing for childbirth.
4,New from straight profit,"Straight Profit has been makin some tight albums lately, first it was yungstar, then Z-Ro, and now Lil Flex. This guy Lil Flex sounds a lot like Yungstar. The album starts off with a bangin track called Welcome 2 My Hood, and then comes one of my favorite tracks called Player, this is a smooth song right here and im defenately feelin' it. Then on track #9 called Damn!!! he takes a shot dissin Lil Flip. I have nothing against Lil Flip, but this song defenately has me jammin to it. So if your a Straight Profit or Yungstar fan, u should pick this album up by Lil Flex"
2,Huh?,"Ok, when I first saw this CD, I was excited, as I love Venom. SO, I picked it up, only to finid out, all it is, is two different compilation CDs jammed together in some cool packaging! It is New, Live and Rare, put together with Greatest Hits 1981-1994 I already HAD New Live and Rare, so needless to say I was not happy.. It's not a terrible compilation, just wish the packaging wasn't so misleading..."
1,"Quite possibly, the worst toy ever...",I wish I had looked at the reveiews before having a family member buy this for my son.I can't believe this toy ever made it out of production. It cannot work. The design is so flawed that it cannot stand up.Do not buy this toy.
3,Sandstorm,"It is fun but very top heavy, it will not stay standing. The suction cups provided are hardly enough to keep this toy grounded."
1,Too top heavy to work right,"wish i had read the reviews on this one before i went and purchased it for my son today..it is way too top heavy to ever stand up..it moves, it falls..for my son to be able to play with it, i had to tie a rope around it and tie it around a small heavy toy box to make it stand up..overpriced and disappointing..might would be fun if the sandman actually stood up as shown in the tv commercials...not worth the money for sure."
1,Poorly Made,"This toy is top heavy and once the motor is turned on, it falls over. Poorly made and not worth the money. This toy will surely frustrate any child."
2,Too top heavy,Sandstorm guy is too heavy to stand up. The bottom support legs cannot handle the weight nor the movement of the upper torso that is attached to the top of the sand storm pit. It is very frustrating even if there is one person that holds the pit up and the other that shoots the car. My 6 year old son was disappointed with it. He still played with it but gave up after two days when the torso started making loud squealing noises. Not worth the money!
1,junk,"save your money! DO NOT BUY THIS!! it is a waste of money! yeah, it works really well for about a week, then the clip snaps off. if you end up not taking my advice, you will get it and realize it is the cheapest thing ever (quality wise). this is crap. don't buy it."
2,Not much if you have a DLP or LCD TV,"If you have a DLP, plasma, or LCD television, I'd try something else. This disc is cheap, but not really helpful. The instructions are useless. They just give you some test screens but don't tell you how you should adjust your set. I'm pretty tech savvy, but this was not helpful at all."
4,"Discwasher Yes, Parts Express No","All of the DVD vendors charge $2.49 for shipping one DVD -- except for Parts Express and they want over $7.00. Why?The Discwasher Calibration Disk is good, although not so good as the Avia Calibration Disk. OTOH, the Discwasher produce is 1/4 the price. Compare and choose wisely."
1,This is a terrible book,"Not even badly researched ... it seems to be un-researched. Offers nothing new. Steals cleverness and cachet wherever it can, but lands flat. The audiobook is read by the author. How many times do we have to say it: HIRE AN ACTOR ... HIRE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO USE THEIR VOICE. It isn't expensive and makes an enormous difference. Locke's voice is monotone, soporific, and seems designed to simply drive coffin-nails into his tired material."
2,Where's the revolution?,"Gonzo marketing was going to be the death of 'marketing as usual' in much the same way, I presume, that Cluetrain represented the ""death of business as usual."" neither happened so I guess either the world didn't listen or the author's didn't quite ""get it"".Gonzo marketing is not an enjoyable read - it can be entertaining but that doesn't make it enjoyable. Just when Locke ought to settle down and actually build on an anecdote supporting his beliefs of a new framework of marketing he digresses (disingenously disappears?) into an aside and we're left wonder exactly what just happened.The publication doesn't need to be written in dry corporate style to support it's thesis. However, it doesn't and the apparent liveliness of mass-media marketing suggests that this publicatioin was more internet evangilism than a practical means of getting your message across."
3,Starts off promising... ends poorly,"Wow! This book was like a breath of fresh air and very vindicating -- saying everything that I'd been yelling at my bosses for ages.And then, midway through the second disc, the author seemed to go into fits of hysterics, talking about duality, spirituality, and eCommerce. Where did this come from? Until this awful turn, it was a great listen."
1,Dangerous if it gets into the hands of a gullible manager,"As a web marketing professional who translates corporate strategies into e-communications (including web), I found this book to be down right awful -- even dangerous if it falls into the hands of a gullible marketing manager trying to understand the web. Though he makes several great points such as how marketing is failing corporate America and that most marketing groups don't have a clue how to embrace the web (how true, how true!), he in turn uses these truths to try to sucker you into a completely hypothetical theory with more holes than swiss cheese. He is a windbag that likes to hear his own voice, but this Gonzo marketing concept is nothing more than the equivalent of an acid trip being documented on paper. Its way out there. There are so many failure points to this theory, yet he just glides over them without a concern."
1,I don't get it,"There may be wisdom here, smart words to actually take action upon and even live by.If so, I can't find them.The book is baroque, convoluted and difficult to plow through.A few folks will enjoy the ride, but most of us have something better to do."
3,One of the best theme composed by James Bernard,"If you have seen SHE, chances are you remember its musical theme. This has to be one of James Bernard's best scores. This CD has extentsive tracks from both SHE and THE VENGEANCE OF SHE. The quality is passable, some of the brass gets distorted on the SHE tracks. On several tracks you can hear the engineer yell out the cue numbers (I'm glad they kept this on the disc). The disk comes with excellent extensive liner notes illustrated with stills(really video grabs, unfortunately) from both movies. There are also reproductions of several lobby cards. The last track on this CD is an interview with music composer Mario Nascimbene, who composed the music for THE VENGEANCE OF SHE. He talks about how he got involved in composing for Hammer Films. Any fan of SHE or Hammer Films should grab this disc!"
3,Heroes,"This book rocked the crib, Bling BlingThis was a good all around book with some action, thrills, and suspense. This book was rather brief but the points were made and this was a well written book. The only downfall found was the ending which came quick and left many open thoughts."
2,Heroes-maybe,"Heroes was about an 18 year old boy who had been injured in WWII. This book was well-written, but I think the focus on war is lost through the rest of the plot. I don't think the actions of the main character are realistic. I know I would be angry and/or depressed if I ended up without a face. I think the main character is holding on to anger that would have been painted over by the war he was in. I have read Cormier before, and this is not one of his best."
2,Missed the mark,"This is Cormier's weakest book -- it doesn't quite work.The core ""incident"" that sparks all of the changes and traumas isn't portrayed as bad enough to cause any of them -- leaving the reader to think that all of the characters are overreacting, which makes the drama of the book ring very hollow."
5,Heroes,"The book that i read was called Heroes. The book Heroes is about a young boy that forged his birth certificate to get into the military. When he was in the military he landed face first on a grenade,which put a hole in his face. ""Unfortionally I lived"", he would say. When he gets out of the Military , he goes back to Frenchtown,which is his home town. While he is there, he is living in cognito. He is on a mission to kill his child hood hero. When I was reading this book I was always wondering what was going to happen next. I thought that the charectors were perfect for this book, very realistic. I would say that this is an excellent book and I encourage others to read it."
2,Emily's Review,"The book was interesting at some parts. The thing I didn't like was that the ending left you hanging. I don't really like Robert Cormier's books, so I think that's why I didn't like it all that much.The main thing was a boy on a mission. Francis, the main character, went to war because he wanted to die. He has been in love with Nicole Renard since he saw her. Then Larry came a long and everybody loved him, he was the town hero. So one night Larry did something horrible to Nicole and Francis didn't was to help her cause he didn't want Larry to see him. When Francis went to war he fell on a grenade, trying to die, but instead his face blew off.This is a Young Adult book so you have to me able to read YA books to read Heroes. The only scary thing was when Francis was on his mission, but it never happened."
1,Consider this book carefully....,"Everybody has their own opinion of a bad book and, well, this is mine. The author totally goes off course with this book, and the chapters start off weirdly and it makes you totally confused. There is no ""adventure"" whatsoever in this book. There is repitition of the same idea or sentence over and over and has no forshadowing. If this book sounds good to you then I suggest you read it, but some other books by the same author might be far more interesting!"
5,Kubler-Ross's last book....wonderful indeed !,The easist way to express my feelings is thatI am purchasing it as Christmas gifts for five friends.The simple idea of approching the idea of death of aloved one and beginning to think through the issues before theevent is so ideal...why did we not think of that !!
5,Excellent resource,"This is a book that I would reccomend everyone read. It is a wonderful guide to the grieving process. It not only helps those going through the process realize what to expect and what is normal, but it also helps those surrounding this person understand better what they are going through. Loss is something we all encounter in our lives and this book helps in preparing us for those times. Also I would reccomend this book as a gift to a grieving person."
5,Recommened to me by my Doctor,"My BFF passed, who was to be 96. I could not process it no matter what. I asked my Dr what i could do to get through grieving as it seemed like it would never pass. He told me about this book and it was so insightful and helpful and broke down the grieving process in the stages. What is best is I could relate to all of it. I recommend this with the utmost conviction."
3,For a new book...,I was upset that there was a big black line going down all the pages on the outside of book. This was a gift for a family member that just lost her father and it looked like a used book because of that line. Upsetting.
5,A very helpful book...,"This book really helped me when my father died. I was so distraught, and this book really helped me in my time of need. It taught me different ways of accepting his death that I never could of done (or thought of) until I read this book. It is very encouraging and very thoughtful. I would highly suggest this book to anyone that is dealing with the loss of a loved one."
4,Good book,Ordered and gave it to my wife who had just lost her mother...she said it helped her with the grieving.
4,Best book on grief I have read,"As a physician, I have had much experience with death and dying over the past 25 years and I was no stranger to Kubler-Ross's work. However, when I lost my own mother last year,the grief felt overwhelming. This book was the best book I read and really helped me to understand the different ways in which we express (or don't express) our grief. It is more powerful because she was facing death as the book was written. I now recommend it to friends, family and patients. It is easy to read and comprehend even if you are in the midst of a great loss."
1,Not a helpful read,"I recently experienced the sudden death of my brother. Elizabeth Kubler Ross' book on Grief and Grieving was recommended to me by a couple of people. I was really hoping it would help me deal with all this. Instead, I found myself having different reactions: the obvious was stated (ex: it's okay to be sad""--oh, really), or many of the things she talked about I could not relate to AT ALL (angels, reincartaion, God),I found myself getting angry and/or frustrated as I read on. Others may view it differently and be able to relate. As for myself, I was definitely disappointed, angry at times by what was said or just did not find it helpful I would not necessarily recommend this book to people dealing with grief."
3,Why are you asking?,I didn't order or receive on my Kindle Paperwhite this product! What's the deal? I still want to know how to access my Kindle Prime Membership PLEASE!
5,awesomeness,I'm soo glad a coworker told me about this book. I recently lost someone extremely close to me and my feelings were all over the board I felt like I was loosing my mind because I had never been so out of control with my feelings. This book helped realize I wasn't crazy I was just grieving. I have passed the book on to several other people who have recently lost someone. You will not regret purchasing this book.
5,A beautiful book on stages of grief,"For anyone who has experienced a deep personal loss (and especially for those who have been through more than 1), this book is an important read. Kubler-Ross compassionately and thoroughly outlines the stages we go through as human beings when faced with a significant loss in our lives. A great book and great gift! Thanks! Kelli Ling"
5,How to Help Grief,"From a classic source and helps understanding. How to do it in a practical way may be better presented in the book Grieving As Well As Possible. Reading several books helps you make some progress through a difficult period. This one may the one to read first, and the Grieving As Well As Possible further along the way, since it takes some work to accomplish the tasks it outlines."
5,A wonderful book!,"I was widowed less than a year ago. This book helped me understand what I was going through emotionally. Every page was a comfort to me. It not only helped me to understand myself better, but it helped me to better support a friend dealing with grief. I highly recommend this book to everyone dealing with grief."
5,Best book on grief,"Over the past two months, I have read at least 10 books about losing a loved one. On Grief and Grieving is far and away the best I have read. The authors explain, one step at a time, what normal grief feels like and what we can expect throughout the grieving process. On Grief and Grieving helped to reduce my feelings of isolation--so common among the bereaved--and gave me hope that I will one day feel better. I highly recommend this book if you are coping (or trying to cope) with the death of a loved one."
1,On Grief and Grieving,"I placed an order on Jan. 1, 2012 and still haven't recieved it-Jan. 28, 2012.It was a gift for my granddaughters birthday on Jan. 29, 2012, and I had to mail it from NH to O'ahu and that takes 5 days minimum. I will never purchase from Amazon again! I want my money back as soon as possible."
5,"Hi, from the Waylons","Hi!this review is partial you can't trust it. I give it five stars. I speak for the Waylons and wanted to say that this is NOT the upcoming full length CD with 14 Songs. This listing is for the six song EP we put out a year or so ago. There are a few links appearing on the web directing people here to purchase our full-length cd which will be out August 06. Confusion has been unleashed by the fact that we've self-titled both items.Of course if you are here to buy the six song EP, more power to you!love,the waylons"
1,Product description is misleading,"The description of ""Owl Pendant 16"" Black Cord Necklace Sterling Silver Jewelry Gift Boxed"" is very misleading. By reading the title, you are lead to believe you are getting the owl pendant with a 16"" Black Cord Necklace, however you only receive the owl pendant if you order this product. It is stated in the comments, but you have to click on the ""1 new & used link"" in order to view the comment. The description would be clearer if it just read ""Owl Pendant""."
4,Cute stocking stuffer.,"This little bear is very cute and of good quality. I would buy it again. Makes a good ""filler"" for Christmas."
1,The Repetition of Nonsense is nonetheless nonsense,"I came across this whole controversy while in college and have kept up with the ""debate"" to some extent since. To make a long story short, Bernal's contentions of ""history"" have been dealt a fatal blow by Lefkowitz, Rogers, et all. Apparently Bernal believes that repeating the same old distortions, and yes unfortunately, out right lies, somehow qualifies as history.I italicized ""debate"" because on the one hand there are responsible historians using the tools and evidence of historians, and on the other there are name calling ad hominem attacks that provide little light but much heat on the matter.Don't waste your time with this rehash if you are already familiar with the controversy. Certainly nothing new, and frankly, one has to be a bit embarassed for Bernal et al."
1,Myth is not history; evidence matters.,"The author?s political agenda is so far ahead of any objective regard for the archeological and linguistic evidence, that this book is rendered academically worthless."
1,Another pile of garbage,"TO ALL READERS: Please read ""White Athena: The afrocentrists theft of Greek Civilization"" by Walter Slack. Unfortunately, and to Bernal's delight, Amazon has categorized this excellent scholary book at the wrong category and it does not show as an alternative within the category it should be. Walter Slack takes Bernal for a very rough ride and quote by quote from Bernal's fictional, afrocentric books destroys all his ridiculus claims and exposes him to the joke that he really is. Search this magnificent work in amazon and please read it. It sets the record once and for all.My one ster on Bernal's garbage is due to no choice for zero."
4,This is the best Star Trek book ever.,"I've read all the Star Trek movie books, and ""Insurrection"" is the one I like the best. The description of the Ba'ku and S'ona homeworld is breathtaking, and the action scenes are well described. Of all, I rate this book very highly and recommend it to everyone I can get my hands on."
1,Over-rated and dull,"The Star Trek books are about in the same shape as the movies are. Poor plots and off characterization is the name of the game here.This autio tape and the film it's based on, brought the series to a new low creative wise and Trek has still shown no signs of visable recovery."
5,PHOTO-PHOTO-PHOTO,"Very impressed with the speed, quality, and functionality. I don't use the external memory card slots, but from what I have tested, it's nice. Great purchased for personal an business use."
2,"Great when it works, but.....","I received the printer (as a great gift) on January 16th, I set it up and it wouldn't print - the ink cartridge holder seemed stuck in place. I called Epson who shipped me out a replacement with no charge or delay. I used that printer for two weeks and it quit. Same problem with the ink cartridge holder. Once again Epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer. It worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday (same problem). So, I'll call Epson when they open tomorrow and try to upgrade to a new/different printer or try once again. The printing results are spectacular, especially when using Epson 4* glossy paper. Anyone else with problems??"
3,Sad Gift to Give,"I bought this printer for a friend as a gift, when we took it out of the box to try it out, it did not work. It gave an error ""ink not recognized"". Called Epson and they sent new ink cartridges, a week and half later all was OK.It was a sad gift to give because it sat there for two weeks. Once it got working she loves it."
5,Does everything I require in a printer.,Previous experience with this printer. What else can I say - it does the job! I have never used anything but an Epson printer!
1,Ink usage a shocker!,I had my previous printer for 5+ years but my grandson needed one so I purchased this Epson thinking I could start printing photos with it. I'm ready to trash the darn thing. It uses ink like it's drinking water. I'm going to try and return it to Amazon.
3,"Good quality, expensive to operate","Produces excellent photo prints when using Epson ink and paper. I just hope I can get near that quality with generics because it is pointless to spend so much on Epson's inks and paper when you can get your prints so much cheaper at a photo lab. If you've got plenty of money to burn, you'll be happy with the results you get from this printer. My advice, though, would be to find something that consumes less ink."
2,Worked for a little while,"This printer did work well once for photos. As soon as the ink ran out (which was after only a few prints) I replaced it an it never worked well again. I've run many ""tests"" where the thing prints the bars to see if the head needs replacing, and after printing 6 of them and cleaning the heads 6 times, I'm all out of yellow ink! The thing wont let you print anything if you are out of any one of the 6 or so inks, even if you don't need that color. I am now reluctant to spend 30-40 dollars on new ink because I'm not sure if it will work or not! If you want to print photos, use snapfish or something. Or another photo printer. If I were paid for the amount of time I have spent trying to get this thing to work again, I'd be able to buy a way better printer than this one!"
1,Ink Hog!!!,"This was the last Epson I'll ever buy. You'll spend more on ink than on the printer in no time, even if you try off brand ink (which it has trouble recognizing). Not recommended."
3,It's drinks ink like an alcoholic in a vat of beer!,"All the previous reviews were dead on about this printer using ink like it's going out of style. It lasts a long time if your printing pages off the internet or for a term paper, but it's main use is supposed to be as a photo printer!@# I ignored the other posts thinking they were exaggerating about the ink usage. DON'T IGNORE THIS POST! I'm not sure how other printers use ink but at best you get about a dozen pictures before you need to replace one or more of the ink cartridges. At that rate you'd be better off sending your pictures to CVS or some other store for it to be printed out. The good thing is if I want a picture or set of pictures real fast all I have to do is print it out at home in under a minute. The prints are excellent quality in most sizes."
5,Awesome Printer,"This year I decided to give 8x10 framed photographs as gifts. However, I knew I would want to play around with output and didn't want to incur the expense of $10 per print - at a pro print shop. The R380 has met my expectations and in just a few days, I've pumped out at least 30 prints! I'm super happy with both my Epson printer and scanner. Ink consumption - sure, it's thirsty but then again, my credit card isn't being charged per print... I'd have spent $300 on prints in two days. Instead, I spent half that - and I'm not half out of ink!"
5,This thing rocks!,"I got one of these along with a Canon G7 for my wife for her birthday--she has been printing non-stop and the pics are amazing. Does it seem to work its way through ink? yeah, but there are no free lunches and I will deal with the ink consumption because of the quality and convenience. As a point of reference, my wife has printed approx 60 4x6 borderless prints and most of the ink cartridges are around 40%."
1,Mine arrived without ink.,"I used my R300 until I got the message that it's service life was over. Ink costs ran about $100.00 per month, like my child support. Now I recieved my R380 and it arrives without ink cartridges. What kind of a deal is that? I didn't need the cable that doesn't come with it, thank God. There is no packing list in the box. I know that print quality is first rate but the machine should be free. Company profit would come from sale of ink. Alas, I'm an Epson man and can't change. I use 4 different Epsons now. PS.. I apologize to Epson. I found the ink, but the printer malfunctions. I'll return it. The problem, I think, is that this printer is very picky about the paper it can handle."
1,My last Epson????,"THE COST IS TO HIGH! The inks that came with printer went very quickly (6 inks), and replacements cost a lot. The paper choices are selective (new Epson paper) and it also cost a lot. I've own the R380 for printer less then a month and 've replaced all the inks once the yellow ink twice, and I am about to replace the black and two others. I haven't done as much printing as I've not done as printing as I've did with my other Epson printers. The other printers cost much, much less to print. So is this my last Epson?"
1,R380 DOA - Factory ink cart defect,"I installed the ink carts on the R380 and got the ""ink carts cannot be recognized"" message.Found that this is a common problem when doing a search. I should have researched better.Epson junk."
2,oops i did it again !!!,"fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. so with out sugar coating it. over the past 6 years i have been using epson printers for my home based printing needs, i am not a professional however i am a broadcast and recording engineer with an a+ computer certification so i do know my way around computers and their peripherals better than most. the R300 is the third epson i have had die on me after 18 months of LIGHT operation. convienently the warranty is only 12 months. once, coincidence, twice, bad luck but three times....sorry epson it will NEVER happen again"
1,Stay away from this printer,"I have had this printer for over a year. It does use a lot of ink, that is the least of its problems. I bought a brand new set of genuine epson cartridges and two of them were rejected by the printer. I was able to replace them with 2 other cartridges and the printer worked for a while, until I needed to replace cartridges again. Now I can not get the printer to work because another 2 cartridges are rejected by the printer. Epson has spent a lot of energy programming their printer to ensure that they capture the income stream from the cartridges -- so much so, that the printer does not always even recognize their own out of the box cartridges. Unless you want to spend countless hours fruitlessly searching the internet for ways to fix this impossible problem and finally throwing it out the window, but another product."
2,Blue eyes look grey.,"The printer works fine. But the color isn't right. When I print pictures of people with blue eyes, the blue is a muddy grey color. I am disappointed since the whole point of the printer is to print photos.Update: 10/25/2010 - I'm still using this printer and it still works. I gave up on using it to print photos because of the color problem, but it works well as a normal printer and copier."
3,Son of Kong,This movie to me doesn't have the action of the original King Kong but if u like the original film then this is good to have for your collection
2,"""The Non-Wonder of the World""","Little Kong is cute, but ""Son of Kong"" (1933) fails to deliver on so many levels - suffering the dire fate of most fast-buck sequels. There's nothing wrong with the lighthearted approach except that Ruth Rose didn't bother to write a coherent script. Willis O'Brien's special effects, Max Steiner's score and Robert Armstrong's welcome return as Carl Denham are wasted in this RKO quickie. ""King Klunker"" would be a more apt title."
3,It did not live up to its expections.,"The movie seemed to be rushed at best. It is hard to beat the first Kong movie, but given time I`m sure it could have.I saw it first when I was a child and I loved it!. It is rather corny but I`m a die hard fan of so called monster movies.I always root for the monster and cry for them in the end,And what are movies for anyway except to entertain,teach us and also get some kind of reaction out of us, and whether it was to cry or to boo it Son of Kong did just that."
3,"Ho-hum. Sequels, eh?","Follow-up to King Kong starts off well with an interesting plot leading up to Denham and friends once again arriving on Skull Mountain island. However, the son of the great ape is very twee at times. Animation as is good as before, though the film could do with some more recognisable dinosaurs. The ending is quite moving, but why do prehistoric islands always get sunk by a volcano?"
3,"It's Kong, but not really","Okay, the major problem with Son of Kong is that there is no ""Fay Wray"" role. I thought initially that Helen Mack might be Kong's bride, but she was never even picked up! King Kong is all about carrying around women and stomping on buildings. Just look at the original, the remake, and King Kong Escapes."
2,Nothing really happens in it.,"Haven't these people ever heard of ""No plot, no script, no service (box office service, that is)."" But still has a very touching ending."
2,"A ""monkey"" of the ape classic!","SON OF KONG lacks everything: no engaging story or great acting, no memorable scenes equal to King Kong and no marvellous music score. As an oddity, it is worth a viewing but movie enthusiasts will not be enthusiastic over this mediocre attempt at a sequel to the classic King Kong. Compare it to the far superior MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (the original film, of course!)."
4,Get the boxset,"Right now you can get the King Kong boxset that contains this, King Kong and Mighty Joe Young for only a few dollars more. Don't let yourself get the incomplete set - or pay more for the collection."
3,The Real 'Beast' Seeks Redemption,"Once you get over the ridiculous coincidences, this hasty post-script to one of the greatest films of all time is fun and worthwhile. Essentially, it's about the redemption of Carl Denham. He's understood and reflected on the consequences of his greed and has rejoined the human race. But that doesn't mean he shaken-off the lure of adventure and money. His return to Skull Island allows him to redeem himself with Baby Kong who, in saving him, shows that Denham has finally been forgiven. Yet there's a suggestion that it's Denham's obsession with Skull Island's treasure which ultimately causes the angry god's destruction of the island. Willis O'Brian's model work is consummate and witty. I just wish there was more of it.The DVD transfer is superb, but beyond trailers there are no extras, and it's only a short film at 69 min. It's a bit expensive to buy on its own, but certainly worth having as part of the magnificent King Kong Box Set."
4,You Go Girl!,This was a well kept secret which I'm so glad to have found. What a remarkable woman. Born before her time. A bit of a charlatan but also wanting more for women than what the times were offering!
3,Interesting,This woman's history and life was interesting. But the book seemed to drag out the story more than necessary. Okay.
4,Quite a Woman!,"As I read the story of Victoria Woodhull's life, I was never sure if I disliked or admired this woman. She was certainly ahead of her time. Many of her quoted statements about politicians, violence, women's rights, etc. echo those we hear today, begging the question......have we prgressed so little?!"
3,Too Detailed,"Interesting story, but too detailed. I did not need to know about every speech she ever gave, but am 'plowing' through it."
4,One of the Most Balanced of the Woodhull Bios,"Mary Gabriel handles her subject, Victoria Woodhull, without criticizing her as other authors like Irving Wallace and Emanie Sachs have done. She has the perspicacity to treat the accusations of prostitution as just that--accusations and gossip heaped on a woman who dared to stand out from the crowd. Gabriel does more to clear Woodhull's name than Woodhull's husband, Col. Blood, was able to do in his lifetime. As a descendant of Col. Blood's last wife, Isabell Blood, I recommend this book, if for no other reason than it continues the work he tried to accomplish--proving that Victoria Woodhull was a courageous, forward-thinking, and spiritual woman maligned by her contemporaries."
5,"You Go, Girl !","What a trailblazer Victoria was. Of course, she got ""seed money"" from wealthy men, but in those days a woman had to use her skills where they were ""allowed"" to be used. She was a feminist during the worst time to be a feminist and her life opened some doors previously closed to women.I applaud her life and her willingness to ""beat her head against the glass ceiling"" to better herself and her family. In ways we don't even appreciate today, Victoria has made life a little easier for all women.Bravo, Victoria ! With the hand you were dealt, you played your cards brilliantly !"
2,Difficult going,"My book group chose _Notorious Victoria_ as one of our monthly selections. To a woman, we all found it a very hard read, even those of us who much prefer nonfiction works. While the subject matter was certainly interesting, the writing style did not do it justice. A great source if you are doing research, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
5,Highly recommended,"Very hard to avoid slipping into adjective overload.Minimal piano sounds, tastefully manipulated and enhanced.A good recording of piano music is amazing enough, but when this familiar instrument is looped and stretched in this way, the piano becomes even more amazing.Mr. Budd worked with another famous producer in the 70s-80s, and made some of my favorite records. Mr Budd never quite returned to that sound, and I always wondered whether those records were just a product of the era, or perhaps Mr Budd didn't quite care for those sounds. I still don't know the answer to that, but I do know that Mr Budd is still quite capable of taking the tiniest, most delicate strings of notes and evoking powerful emotions - sometimes romantic or wistful, sometimes hopeless, isolated.Adjectives again.Buy it before it disappears."
5,Absolute classic Budd,"Translucence surprised me in familiarity - Mr. Budd's minimalist piano melodies have a timeless feel that evokes The Pearl (perhaps his finest work), and sends the mind into nether regions that connects to experiences long past. Dangerously beautiful. Drift music is more abstract, but a wonderful companion piece. This set is an absolute must for fans, and well worth the price, as this is two full albums. A hidden treasure trove of ambient delicacies."
4,a true rock pioneer,"I got into ""roots rock"" around 1975 (I was 20); until then, I thought anything before the Beatles was strictly old hat. Anyway, that's when I discovered Eddie Cochran. I picked up the double United Artists Legendary Masters series. I guess it was because he wrote his own material and played his own lead guitar that I was attracted to him - plus he wrote Summertime Blues and Come On, which I thought were great. I thought Gene Vincent was a one-hit wonder - I could never understand why the Beatles thought so much of him. Then, finally, I bought the Capital collection when it came out in 1990 and became an instant fan. Man, when he had Cliff Gallup, he was incredible. What a voice! So, anyway, I picked this up, and though much of it is fairly lo-fi, and not all of it's even him, it's still a great document."
4,Bukem and Conrad back again,"Once again the Good Looking crew has added on to the Progression Sessions series of discs, this being the seventh in the series. Just like Volume 6, Bukem decided to use a live set for the album, this time Tokyo's Liquid Room becomes the stage for Bukem and Conrad's unique blend vocals and drum and bass.Bukem seems to have dropped the deeper d&b sounds from past Progression Sessions in favor of the jazzier and melodic tempos of Greenfly's G-Funk, Greg Packer, Kymera, and Makoto. This album also features Bukem's remix of Herbie Hancock's The Essence, in addition to a reworking of the classic PFM track The Western which Conrad dubs ""The Old-Skool Brand-Nu"" If you like jazzier drum and bass, or Bukem/Conrad in general pick it up already."
4,Good header for the price,My only complaints is that the header bumps into the transmission but that doesn't not prevent it from installing correctly and the gaskets they include in the kit are paper and very cheap. I still really like the header for the money and was able to get it installed correctly.
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,"This book is fantastic! Such a great resource for those looking to take their health into their own hands. Paul Chek helps the average individual truly understand how nutrition and exercise affect the body, and how the body responds down to the cellular level. He helps put you back in control of your health. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for sustainable change for a more active, healthy lifestyle."
5,Chek Does It Again,"Paul Chek and the Chek Institute has developed a life changing program. This holistic approach is well rounded and a good change of pace from the usual dogma from so called experts. I use this book every day and learn how to adjust myself for better health and fitness. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve there overall health and lifestyleJust remember an ""Idle butt is the devils fat depository."""
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed to see how much of the book is dedicated to exercises. There is no doubt as to the importance of exercising and stretching, but over one third of the book focuses on them, with written instructions to accompany the diagrams. The tests at the beginning were interesting, but not very enlightening. The emphasis on organic foods stood out the most, but i think for most people, it's a hard sell. Since i already eat organically, i had little use for that section. I plan to return this book."
5,Eat Move and be Healthy,"Fantastic book, great author. Everyone that wants to be healthy, mind, body and soul, should read this book and do what it suggests!"
5,Excellent Holistic Approach,"I was looking for a solution to my constant hunger issue and found a holistic approach to health, exercise, and life. I highly recommend this book to people looking to change the way they eat and exercise. This is not a diet but a way of life and it works. It is easy to read and understand."
5,glassy,the most impressive dish I think the truth has a volume filling super nice and short at any time is amazing how good this dish sounds like I am to do with my sound full plate in my battery maybe a 18 inch thanks
2,Missing Items...?,"I was thinking this item would come with the cords to connect to the phone/wall....but it didn't. So, I have a tape recorder that I cannot use until I pay more money to buy the cords!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This items is a piece of junk. The voice on playback sounds like minnie mouse, and you have to put your ear on the speaker to hear anything, and that is with the volume cranked up to max. Will never buy radio shack again. Disgusted."
5,For Burton scholars,"This is Burton showing his politically incorrect side that some of us love.Be aware that this is volume 1 only. Volume 2 is only available in another edition. If you want the whole work, be sure you can buy them both before ordering one.This is not for an introduction to Burton; read this after you've read his classics like ""Journey to Mecca and Medina,"" ""City of the Saints,"" and the African journals. Most of those are available in Dover editions."
5,Mind Blowing Experience,"This is an incredible CD by an incredible band that will be signed to a big record label anyday now. Pick this up while you still can! ITs fast, heavy, and has tads of melody here and there. A+"
3,"An intense, mindblowin ride","This band will blow you away. Featuring an intense metal sound dominated by machine-gun drum attacks, wicked guitar work interlaced with vicious bass and an incredible vocal barrage. At times they can sound like Slipknot, Machine Head, even Pantera, but they are their own band and one of the heaviest I've heard in a long time. This cd only features five songs and an additional two hidden tracks. Standouts include ""Sphere"", ""This Present Darkness"" and track #13 (one of the hidden songs). Chimaira possess talent and exhibits promise but they need to work on diversifying their sound and maybe their singer could work on expanding his vocal range. Otherwise a great cd."
2,"Not a total disaster, but...","There are so many great recordings of La Boheme that it was perhaps not wise of Bocelli to try to compete with them. Among the great Rodolfos on record Gigli, Di Stefano, Bjoerling, Bergonzi, Pavarotti and Domingo come to mind. They all sang Rodolfo for many years before they venture into the studio. I know Bocelli sang some La Bohemes in Italy before recording the opera, but his inexperience shows more often than not. The voice itself is not unpleasant, but it's not the voice of a great operatic tenor, it's certainly NOT the voice of a Bjoerling or a Di Stefano. I think Bocelli would be ill adviced to keep singing opera. The Mimi is more earthbound but hardly memorable, the conducting is not on a par with Toscanini's, Beecham or Karajan. I confess I bought this recording expecting a disaster, it's not, but then, neither it is a recording I would care to hear again. Now, if Barbra Streisand had been chosen as Mimi and Michael Bolton as Marcello...who knows?"
2,Ehhhh . . .,"Bocelli plays his part with the strains and emotional outpourings that are appropriate to his character; unfortunately, this is not the only thing needed for an operetic voice. Yes, he's got a nice, convincing sound, but just like Pavoratti singing ""New York, New York"", it just doesn't fit: maybe for a musical, but not for an opera.Bocelli fans will enjoy this and would probably enjoy it more if they only bought the highlights album.As for everyone else, Beecham's version is great. Buy that if you want an opera."
4,La Boheme,"I have listened to Mr. Bocelli singing Rudolfo in the La Boheme recording....he has a perfect voice for Rudolfo and it is full of expression and passion....we must remember that Mr. Bocelli has not studied as long, nor performed as long as some of the opera stars he is constantly being compared to....I think some of them should sit and listen to Mr. Bocelli's interpretations... even though most are long gone....they might have learned a thing or two. This recording of La Boheme is well worth buying..Mr Bocelli's voice is beautiful....he sings with such seeming ease."
2,Bocelli?--not quite,This is not a record that one wants to listen more than once. Bocelli's voice is just not fulfilled in this recording. The only good thing about this recording is that it is DDD.
2,"Oh, the tragedy of it . . .","Oh, the tragedy of it that the divine Florence Foster Jenkins died before the arrival of her perfect co-star. Think of it, Bocelli and Jenkins in La Boheme. Bocelli and Jenkins in Aida. BOCELLI AND JENKINS IN TRISTAN AND ISOLDE!The orchestra sounds all right, if a bit lugubrious--give it a second star."
2,Don't expect too much,"Bocelli is one of those singers who sound like they should be singing opera, until you put them in an opera. I've heard almost every recording of this opera as well as several performances and Bocelli doesn't measure up to anyone I've heard sing this music. For that matter, Frittoli has sung much better than what she sounds like here.Its nice to know that a blind singer can be so beloved that they're given an opportunity to record this great opera. But this really is mediocre. He really should stick to Neapolitan songs where his voice doesn't have to compete with actual operatic voices and large orchestras. If you love everything about Bocelli then I'm sure you'll love this recording. Otherwise seek out recordings of tenors, such as Richard Leech or Neil Shicoff, who can really bring Rodolfo to life."
3,A little disappointed,"I was looking forward to a new album of Andreas to listen to his voice, and when I got La Boheme, I was disapponted only because I did not know it was a full opera with all the other singers doing their part. I was expecting to hear only Andrea as in his other albums. I know this is one of his favorites so do not want to discourage anyone who likes opera. Just know that you hear very little of him in this album. The words and storyline are there if you want to get familiar with the story. But as far as just listening, I prefer to hear only Andrea or an occasional duet. I will be forever a devoted fan = I say when you have perfection (for me he is) why listen to anything else., I do, but not often His music takes up most of my music listening time and after 2 1/2 yrs I have still not grown weary of it, nor do I think I ever will."
5,Best dish cubes,"I have used these for months and have never had one problem. I put everything in my dishwasher and some with dried on gunk and they always come clean. I don't know why others have problems, but i do not."
3,Method Dish Cubes,"I like the design of the product and the scent. However, it doesn't work quite as well as the Electro-tabs I was using before. Glasses on the top rack would never seem to get clean."
4,Easily Understood,"I bought this book to suppliment J. Weingreen's ""A Practical Grammar for Classical Hebrew"" which I am currently using to prepare for the qualifying entrance exam for seminary. Weingreen's book is long on exercises but very brief on grammatical explination. ""Basics of Biblical Hebrew Grammar"" is the exact opposite! It does a wonderful job explaining Hebrew grammar but there are NO exercises/vocab (I havent yet looked at the enclosed CD which may contain these things).If you are attempting to learn hebrew by yourself (or having difficulty w your current hebrew grammar) this is a great textbook to have - it explains hebrew grammar in an understandable way and minimizies on route paradigm memorization. But you will have to purchase a suppliment for exercises and vocabulary."
1,sugar free licorice,"Tasteless and tough, purchased 4 bags, returned 3 and threw the one I opened in the trash."
2,Too much shipping fee,This candy is terrific especially for sugar free. My only complaint was I bought three candy items from this vendor and they put them all in a bag which cost little to send it but they charged me an exhorbitant amount to ship it to me. I won't buy from them again because of this. they could have put them all in a priority mail box and got them to me faster and cost would have been little to even rush them to me. Terribly disappointed.
2,sugar alcohol good and bad,"Dear Amazon,I have purchased s/f black licorice from Amazon and I love it! The problem is that the sweetener (sugar alcohol) causes me the worse gas (flatulence) I have ever experienced! What exactly is the problem? And is there a solution?Sinderely,John Harris[...]"
1,an idiot's treatise,"This book is an earnest attempt to turn back civilization 4,00 years. One can only wonder how writers like this spend their free time. I think though it might be reading books like Secret Agent Barbie, a real potboiler that is far more grounded in existing reality than is this claptrap."
5,Amazing,"This is an amazing CD of J.S.Bachs's clavicembalo concertos: full of life and vigour and at the same time with a profound knowledge of the ""historische Aufführungspraktik""."
4,Good fit,Good fit for my canister vac. No issues with the product. Has been holding up well. Holds a lot of dirt for such small bags.
1,This is not a book for training scent hound type dogs,"This is not a book for training hound type dogs, this is a good book for any one that is training a police dog, or any other type of dog that can only track a scent two hours old. This book is great for teaching any dog to track that otherwise would have no interest in tracking game. A dog not part of the scent hound family. Hope this helps.."
5,Run Run as fast as you can,I read this book when I was very young and it has stayed very close to my heart for many years. Even now at 21 I am desperately looking for a copy. This book was the first book to make me cry all those years ago and it made me realize the power of reading. Thank you Mary Pope Osborne for givong me the gift to love books. I search in anticipation for another book to move me so.
4,Good observation of love,"""Sky of Love"" isn't exactly what the description on the back of the DVD says it is, but the premise of two people in different decades contacting each other via a radio is correct. Both parties are in relationships. Xiao-jai (Gigi Leung's character who's in the past) is just starting a sweet relationship with a close friend and Wen Tao's (Ken Zhu's character who's in the present) relationship with his girlfriend is falling apart. Right away the characters find out they are in different time periods. Over the days as they talk via the radio they discuss love and what it is. The movie looks at how love was regarded circa 1980 and what people think of it now in the 21st century. The end of the movie is very bittersweet. The movie is not boring (unless you don't like romantic dramas) and the acting is well done. Plus the subtitles are good and the main idea of the movie is easy to understand. I give it four stars."
1,Disappointed!,"Having thoroughly enjoyed ""The Red Tent"", I was extremely disappointed with this book. I feel cheated - such a mediocre book shouldn't even have been published - the writing is poor, the story is shallow and the characters have little depth. After the first third of the book, I was ready to throw it in the trash but persevered on, skimming the last pages - I'd hoped it might redeem itself but it remained true to hits beginning, never getting one bit better. unfair of the publisher to pull us in, just because Ms. Diamant had previously written a decent book."
1,BORING,"Having been absolutely blown away by ""The Red Tent, I couldn't wait to start reading ""Good Harbor"". What a BORE! I can't believe that this is even the same author. ""The Red Tent"" is on my top 5 book list. ""Good Harbor"" lacked anything interesting. Half way through the book I had to ask myself the point of reading this. Who really cares about these two women, and their boring lives. Both women in the story nauseated me to no end. There is nothing interesting about them, as well as nothing interesting about their lives. I started to wish for awful things to happen to the characters like Kathleen's cancer to spread, or Joyce's husband to leave her so there would at least be something worth reading. Chapter after chapter, these characters didn't change, what a waste of time. If you loved the Red Tent, chances are you won't love ""Good Harbor"". Save yoruself the time don't bother"
4,good harbor,"I throughly enjoyed reading ""Good Harbor"". Anita Diamant never disappoints. Anita's characters become your friends. I'm looking forward to my next good read by her."
3,Comfortable book,"Like others here, I loved 'The Red Tent' by Diamant. 'Good Harbor' has its own merit, which in my opinion, is the profile of the kind of relationship most of us have if we are lucky. The kind of friendship that is comfort, honesty, and trust, but like real relationships, Joyce and Kathleen's friendship in 'Good Harbor' has its problems too. This novel isn't as compelling or captivating as 'The Red Tent' but I still enjoyed reading it. Hey, no one can hit every single one out of the ballpark."
3,Easy reading,"I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't too deep, easy to pick back up where I left off when interupted by my toddler. There were a couple surprises that I wasn't expecting in the story. All in all it was entertaining."
5,A Treat for Women,"This novel is so interesting from start to finish. Set in beautiful Gloucester, Ma., one of my favorite places on earth, this is the story of two women who become fast friends when each realizes that an ear and good advice is necessary in their lives. The stories of each woman is very well expanded so that thereader feels like she gets to know the characters. The ladies utilize the beach and its surrounding area as a place of tranquility and calm. Their almost-daily walks lead to a great understanding of other peoples troubles and how we are really never alone in our problems. A great read!"
5,A Comfort Book!,"During this time of uncertainty in the world around us, I quickly and happily immersed my self in the life of ""Good Harbor"". I found myself easily drawn into the characters and the world around them. This novel addresses many important issues - friendship, love, parenthood, the environment and careers. As so many of us are realizing these days, there is much about our lives that is out of our control. However, we can control how we relate to the people and the environment closest to us. The story of ""Good Harbor"" illustrates and helps us experience the importance of accepting our lives and appreciating the world that is in our own backyard."
2,The men are the only characters who do anything,"While this is ostensibly a book about women's sensitivities to friendship, the women in question didn't exhbit any insight into themselves or - particularly - to the needs of their families. In fact, the men in the book are the ones taking chances, trying new careers, driving and cooking on command. A book about them would likely have been a lot more interesting. Ladies, get a life! And readers, find another book that's a lot more fun."
5,Just when you were about to give up on women friends...,"this book reminds you of why it's worth it to sift through the catty, competetive aquaintances to find one or two true female companions. I loved The Red Tent and was wary of a contemporary novel, but my concerns were unfounded. I couldn't put Good Harbor down either, even reading with a flashlight into the night after a day at the beach with three kids! I immediately passed it along to my dear friend who finished it just as quickly. We both decided the best line of the book was when the characters were discussing certain tragedies in the lives of women which are the price to pay for the miracles of having two x chromosomes - ""It sucks and don't let anyone try to tell you different."" Sometimes all the hormonal BS is worth it just to have one good girlfriend to tell all your deep, dark secrets."
4,a good read!,"I felt such a connection with this book that I read it twice--once tearing through it, amazed by the many (not all!!) parallels between the book and my life, and again more leisurely to see what I really thought of it as a book. OK, this may not have the literary heft of THE RED TENT, which I read after GOOD HARBOR--perhaps accounting for the divergence between my views and the disappointment of those who picked this up expecting another RED TENT. And there are places where the devices in the plot showed as just that. But despite that, I enjoyed the book, and find myself thinking about its themes weeks later. Diamant clearly understands how easy it is to walk through our comfortable but hectic suburban lives without really connecting with one another, the emptiness that comes with that, the yearning for community, and the power of friendship.Thank you, Anita!"
2,Disappointing,I enjoyed her first novel and was a little disappointed by Good Harbor. Never felt interested in the characters and no real desire to finish the book
4,Beautiful Story - Plot Not the Point,"This book is not about the plot. It's about friendship, love, family, and what that all means. Incredible. I sent it to my mother, who also has gone through radiation therapy for breast cancer, and I can't wait to bond with her just a little more over this book."
2,Cliches and yawns...found myself nodding off...,"Dense to get through because it's so prosaic...am I alonein being slightly offended that a well-received published writer uses cliches like ""bored her silly""? I mean, it showsthat she just didn't take this book very seriously.In fact, it's actually the author's ""romance novel."" Wasshe ashamed of this book, like the romance writer in'Good Harbor'? Well, she should be...the book kind ofgoes ""plink, plunk, plink,"" like an amateur playing ""Chopsticks"" over and over on the piano.That said, the book held interest for me only in that Icome from Cape Ann, Mass. and so was interested tosee what sites there the book would visit. Otherwise -ho-hum...never would have gotten published, in my opinion,if the author wasn't a so-called ""literary darling."""
4,An Enjoyable Read,"Maybe the people who liked Red Tent won't like this book; for myself, I didn't personally like Red Tent -- felt the writing was overwrought, but I very much enjoyed this story of friendship. I liked the rendering of the family relationships in Good Harbor, and I liked the faith issues that kept coming up. Not a great book, maybe, but a good read and that's no small praise."
4,Quick and very good read.,"After having read The Red Tent I was intersted in reading Good Harbor. From reading the preview I knew that this was going to be nothing like The Red Tent.Kathleen and Joyce are two woman who are tough points in there life and need someone to talk to and slowly tell each other what has been going on with them for there life.Now while the writing style was nothing like The Red Tent, it was still a very enjoyable book with a good storyline. It takes a tone in a modern world with good characters.I am looking forward to more from this talented author."
1,What a disappointment!,"After thoroughly enjoying The Red Tent I approached Good Harbor with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the book is a letdown. The two main characters are poorly drawn and unsympathetic. Their comfortable middleclass lives and insignificant problems pale in comparison with the challenges and problems faced by real people in today's world. Add to that the fact that they are whiny and uninteresting and you have a mediocre book. I, too, finished the book but don't really know why. The ending was just as pat and unconvincing as the rest of the novel."
2,Flat and boring,"If it were not because of the well earned recognition the author got out of The Red Tent, this book would likely not have passed through any publishing agent, and I would not be here giving feedback. The characters are meaningless, nothing interesting happens, none of the subjects covered were touched with any depht. The author did a good job carefully portraying the setttings, especially the harbor, and the narrative is engaging; but when you finish you wonder what was supposed to be the point. This is probably among the bottom 10% of the books I have read, and I can recommend at least a hundred books before recomending reading this one."
3,Story of 2 women dealing with life,"I actually give this book 3.5 stars. It's a very good story and a treat to read with real as life characters living out their life's situations. Joyce is entering a lonely stage in her life because her daughter is growing older and more distant as well as a lack of connection to her husband. Kathleen deals with her treatments for breast cancer and the depressing memory of the death of her son 25 years ago.These two women meet in a coastal, New England town and take daily walks on the beach as their friendship grows. They share pieces of their lives with each other.This is a very mellow story and a rather quick book to read. The writing flows and the landscape descriptions can actually ""take"" the reader to the beach. Very good book that I definitely recommend any middle aged woman to read, but would be enjoyed by anyone."
4,The American Experience,"It would be impossible to expect something like The Red Tent in a second novel. This book is different from her first effort in that she tries to focus on the American Religious Experience. She hits upon a variety of issues and topics that follow contemporary society - the death of a child and the unwillingness to talk about it, the onset of cancer and the unwillingness to talk about it, the teen years and the generation gap, questions about faith and marriage. In a nutshell, it is a coverage of many complex issues, and Ms. Diamont does well to hit on all of them. The characters are great and she develops them well.I would recommend this book quite highly even though it may hit a nerve or two for some people. It is a timely novel with timely contemporary issues."
3,Beach Book,"The book takes place in one of my favorite places...Good Harbor Beach in Mass. Unfortunately, that is all I really liked about it...I thought it would be more about friendship between two women and their heart to heart sharing. It seemed more dysfunctional and less genuine between the characters. Sometimes you want a book to reflect your own life and this one did not. It's a fluffy beach read...that's about all."
3,"A light, yet thoughtful read","I was surprised to find that I liked this book as much as I did.The book struck me at first as choppily written and amateurish. But I liked it more and more as I went along, especially the spiritual aspects of the story.Recommended as a light, yet thoughtful read."
1,Dud,"This book should never have been published. It is full of platitudes, and very poorly written. Is also boring. The women it portrays are bored, boring middle class women, with too much time on their hands. Kathleen is so self indulgent that she should be denied cancer treatment, and her so called friend, Joyce, is a selfish cow. And the are both boring. The conversations Anita Diamant portrays are boring. Come on girls, and this included you Anita - move on from this drivel."
2,Too stereotype,"Was expecting a story with deep emotion. I found a standart, not exciting, superficial, predictable read. I did finish the book, because I was convinced somewhere there would be The line that made it all worth it, but it did not come."
3,a quiet book,"I am not really sure what to say about this book. I liked it, but yet I when I finished it, I wasnt' really sure what kept me reading. Maybe because I liked the characters, or just liked the story of a good friendship between two women. But....if you're looking for a page turner, don't pick this up, if you are looking for a quiet read for a couple of hours, than this is the book for you!"
2,Flat. Tepid. A simple read.,"I respect Diamant for trying to write meaningfully about the relationships between women and their struggles to incorporate their faith into their lives. Unfortunately, those aspects were probably the only things I appreciated about this book...Kathleen's character (the most engaging one in the story) is slow to emerge. The other characters feel flat and unengaging. I had really hoped for something more from this book."
2,A disappointing read.,"I chose not to read the Red Tent as I was not interested in the subject matter, but picked up Good Harbor thinking it would deliver a good read. By the end of the book I questioned why I hadn't laid it down before as I found the characters contrived and at best, unlikely. Kathleen and Joyce's friendship takes off far too quickly for my taste, they are bonded in an immediate velcro-like relationship without ever having had the chance to get to know each other. Reminds me of high school infactuations, ""falling in love "" on the first date. The book speaks about the tragedy of familial loss, but not soon enough, and readers will likely be long gone before the meat of the book is presented. There are far, far better books out there right now. All in all, a very disappointing read."
4,good companionship and the smell of the ocean...,This book made me long for the coast and a good friend to chat with! Serious subject matter (Katherine's cancer treatment)is discussed in a way that made it seem real to me. I must say when I began this book I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. The characters were real to me and seemed to be the sort of people I would like to get to know.Overall I would recommend this to women over 30.
2,Zzzzz,"Why shouldn't we compare it to ""Red Tent?"" Many people bought this book because they loved Diamante's first novel and many people felt let down. After reading both, I thought it seemed as if she spent five years writing ""Red Tent"" and three months on ""Good Harbor."" I found the female friendship trite, and the beginning of their relationhip reminded me of a cliche romance novel. I would really need to search hard to find something redeeming about this book. The descriptions of the places could be the strong point, but a book needs more. I wish ""Kathleen"" would have done something about the children's library. I wish either of these women would have done something constructive. I didn't care much about these characters, although I thought I would by reading the description of the book. This book was about as satisfying as a fat-free brownie."
4,A fun book for all ages,"CHEATING LESSONS combines humor, suspense, and an intriguing moral conundrum into an engaging stew that kept me reading into the wee hours of the night. This story has the power to make even ""grown-up"" readers think about growing up, learning about human nature, and the importance of figuring out and acting upon one's own sense of morality. Bernadette Terrell is a well-crafted character, one that teens could identify with, but also one who has her own contradictions and is grappling with the challenge of how to become the person she knows she should be. If you're doubtful that a suspenseful story of the ""can't-put-it-down"" variety can be created from controversies surrounding a high school Classics Bowl match, read CHEATING LESSONS and see just how it can be done."
2,Too thin.,"The sweater is the usual high quality associated with Zegna. However, the material is so thin, it clings to my body. It was probably due to this undesirable feature, that the garment had been discounted so greatly. However, I knew that possibility existed, when I saw the sweater on your website.I initially planned to return the purchase, but later changed my mind. When worn with a jacket, the effect is good."
3,Would be great for a Sunday School class,"This book was interesting. It wasn't what I expected. It has some really great activities for each lesson though. I think it would work great for a Sunday School or church's Story Hour class. SOme of the activities involve a lot of equipment or items, though."
1,Expensive recalibration required!,"According the the manufacturer, this device requires periodic re-calibration which can only be done, feasibly, by the company. Re-calibration costs approximately 40% of the purchase price and these facts should have been prominently disclosed in the item description! Now I'm stuck with a 15% re-stocking fee plus return postage. Not a good experience."
2,This isn't your best choice,"This lens shows too much color aberation and blur to be useful. I compared the 2x photo at the same scale as photo without lens. The color fringing and loss of detail was obvious and standard lens with digital zoom showed more detail. I received a no hassel, prompt refund and purchased a fixed mount lens (avail for A-series Canon, at least) for 50% more money. This would have been a 1 star rating but for the low price and good build quality and cosmetics."
5,Symphony No. 5 by Joachim Raff,"The recording of Joachim Raff's Symphony No. 5, performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra under the direction Matthias Bamert, is an excellent performance and a must for one's symphonic library. The only reservation about this recording is is distant sound and low volume."
2,Dances in a Somewhat Christain Church in Unpopular Medicine,"The book, although interesting, doesn't show the true nature of the Christain Church, nor anyother form of religious denomination what so ever. Though the facts seem to be true, they seem hard to believe and the writting, though education is evident, seems to be written from a one sided view and not very reliable."
5,Very small!!!!,Very small size! Customer service was great in swapin em' out for another product on their dime. Definitly great people to work with and great product!
4,thank goodness...,"yes. thank you.i'm so glad people still take the time to make original music. the market is so saturated with the same old thing it's hard to find ""real"" music out there. the business people, who are very good at what they do, are always going to take their money and be safe. why would they gamble on some lanky guy with a strange voice that dresses in yarn?if you've found this record you're one of the lucky ones. keep listening until you find all pop radio for what it is: just another un-clever, unwanted commercial.hooray for dufus!"
5,Use headphones for optimal listening experience...,Dufus Rocks and Seth is a genius. see video at punkcast.com
1,"You, sir are the dufus.",I don't know. I don't get it. I would strongly encourage you to spend your pennies on something else.
3,A bit too bulky,"This is indeed comfortable for my risk, but it's ""overdoing"" it a bit sizewise. I don't need all the mouse space vertically or horizontally, and this thing takes up a LOT of space on my desk :(."
1,Too inaccurate to be useful,"I wanted to use this to photo touchup in Photoshop. It's just too inaccurate. Using this pen is light using an ""old fashioned"" ball mouse jammed up with dirt. The mouse pointer jumps around, making it impossible to make small adjustments on the screen."
1,"Bad, bad pen","I'm sorry but my wife bought this for me as a present because I was looking for an optical pen that had handwriting recognition. As a mouse it works just okay. I don't prefer it over Wacom; however, as a handwriting recognition tool it is useless. I don't know how much my wife paid but any amount was too much. I called their technical support. They did not answer their phone like a business, they just said ""hello."" After I explained the problem, they transferred me to someone's voice mail. I left a messege but I never got a call back. When I emailed their technical support I received an error messege that their mailbox was full. Bad pen, bad purchase."
4,It works fine,I have a couple of weeks with this pen mouse. All the software is easy to install. The resolution isn't very good but it works well. The software for handwriting recognition is not perfect; I could say that works at 90%. I have noted that it works better in English than Spanish. I bought it because I like the idea to make notes or drawings over any other application. You can save all your notes as image with the application as background.
3,Had to return it after 2 dyas,"I bought this in lieu of a tablet (pen mouse) so I could do some design work, but the pen mode on this is terrible. I should say its worth exactly the money you pay. It worked well as a mouse, but that was not the application I was interested in. I was skeptical when I ordered it, but I took the chance of trying it before giving up. The device was not able to track precise movements of my hand when I started doing my designs. It was very jerky and even if you hold the device in one location, the cursor would start drifting. Shiny surfaces aggravated this problem as the device is optical in nature (like optical mouse).Overall, if you are buying this for coolness factor, it is not a bad bet for your money. The device works, does a good job as a mouse and works off the bat without any special driver needed for it. But if you are looking for performance and precision, this is not your device."
4,i-Pen is easy to use and a great deal for the price!,"I have used this i-Pen for about 2 weeks and I really enjoy it. I was tired of trying to find a mouse that would work on an airplane or in the car. With the i-Pen, you can use any surface and as little as 1 inch to move the pointer 6 inches in any direction. Perfect for drawing quick sketches or surfing the web.Pros: compact, low cost, runs with regular usb mouse drivers built into windows or linux.Cons: The only complaint I could come up with is that double clicking with the tip of the i-Pen is too slow for some things if you are in a hurry."
2,I stopped using it after a few attempts,"The pen did not install fully after a single restart. I had to restart twice to the working.It does not write well just on ""any surface"". I found it quite a inconvenient and stopped using it after a few attempts."
2,Did not last,Great idea but this product did not last very long. I wish this product was made of a betteer quality.
2,Not good...,"I have been desperately trying to find a replacement for a standard mouse that's more ergonomic. Though I didn't try out the handwriting/drawing features, as a mouse it was way too imprecise to do much of anything. It was a disaster trying to select cells in Excel and just as bad for routine mouse use. About the only good thing I can say about this was that the cord positioning was pretty good - stayed out of the way."
4,Works great as a mouse,"I bought this device mainly because I was having wrist problems with the mice I was using (even ergonomic mice). Just wanted a device that would put my wrist in a gentler position. I use this ipen mostly for mousing, not for drawing and making notes. On that count, I say it has helped me a lot. My wrist is a lot better now. It took a couple of days to get used to it, and it's great. The right-click is still not super quick, that's why I give it 4 stars for ease of use."
4,great for the price,I bought this item for my Mom for x-mas. She had been asking for one for quite some time and finally there was one at a reasonable price. She uses it for Photo Editing and drawing on Photoshop and she likes the control it gives you vs. a regular mouse. I recommend this product for any computer artist.
5,Friggin' cool little pen,"Okay, so I'll keep this short and simple. Buy this! The optical sensor works great, the design is comfortable, and it looks cool. The only thing that would make it better is if it was wireless. I almost started using this as my everyday mouse, until I got my wireless Trackman. Very impressed. I would highly recommend this product."
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this pen for my daughter to use. She loves to use the art programs on the computer. The stuff she was creating were pretty impressive and she was using a mouse with her right hand, she's a lefty. I was curious to see what she could do with a pen and her left hand. WOW. It's amazing how much detail she can put in to a picture with this! She loves it! It's super easy to use and has some pretty cool features."
1,Atrocious,"I had high hoped for this product, and looked forward to doing some writing with it. The very low dpi makes this product incredibly inaccurate--this means I can write better with my real mouse than with this pen."
2,Interesting Idea but poor result,"The idea for this product is very interesting, but unfortunately you can not write with it. I bought this to use it with OneNote and save my sketches and notes as in a tablet PC. The result is really poor. First you have to write diagonally on the pad to get it straight to the video. Then the learning curve is very long that it is just easier to type the information in. Moreover, I thought this product was useful in order to prevent repetitive stress disorder, but the position I have to keep my wrist on, causes pain if done for more than 1 hr a day. If you want to use this product to write your note, buy something else. If you want a cool gadget to mess up with Photoshop, it might be not too bad"
2,Not any more effective than a mouse,"Great idea in theory.I was looking for something that would be good for hand written notes on PDF documents (editing) and GoToMeetings (online conferencing). However, between the mouse pad and pen, it just don't work any more effectively than a regular mouse. I think the problem was the gridded mouse pad."
4,sandppppr,"It works very well, you can mark up your computer screen to your hearts content, but it only works with Internet Explorer (not- as an example-Firefox.) It works extremely well if you want to send a personal e-mail message."
1,"Good idea, very bad product","I've used a Wacom tablet before so I may have expected too much from this pen off the bat. I'm sorry to say I can't list any Pros on this product.Cons:For starters, the tip depresses like a mouse button for it to react, so forget about drawing in Illustrator/Photoshop or sketching in a flow chart program. This is why I bought it so it's basically useless for me.Second, the shape of it is unnatural, I'm constantly trying to turn it to get a grip. Maybe the technology isn't there yet but if they can't make it shaped like an actual pen you won't find it comfortable to use.Third, it's not wireless. When you use the pen and point it anywhere near vertical the cord flops into your hand, which frustrates me constantly.Unfortunately I'm thoroughly disappointed with this and will try and return it. I had high hopes that I could replace my Wacom tablet but this product won't even come close to that."
4,Pretty good value,the pen requires some practice to use.I write significantly slower with the ipen than using regular pen and paper.It's really easy to install.I use it mostly to follow my professor's powerpoint slides during lectures.
3,dont buy if you have a mac,"I read that it was compatible with mac OS systems, and then I read that only some portions of it were compatible. One user said that it all worked except for the handwriting recognition. I decided I was OK with that, and that I would buy it any way. None of the software works with mac though! the pen works fine as a normal mouse...but that's kinda boring. so if you're looking for a cool cheap graphic pen that can write on web pages and do a lot of cool stuff, this isn't for you"
3,not as cool as a tablet or touch screen,too hard to write as I write on a piece of paper. The trace is not the trace I move my hand.
1,Don't Expect Tech Support!,"When I installed the driver on my computer, it caused it to crash! Tried to call the number listed in the back of the manual and was told to call another number. That number was a generic voice mail. Then I tried to email tech support and that email was returned to me saying that the mailbox was full. In other words, I was on my own... Thank goodness I purchased this POS from Amazon.com! It's being returned a.s.a.p.!"
2,I'm Off To Buy A Wacom...,"This is great for a mouse but Vista and Windows 7 will not recognize it in their handwriting recognition programs which makes it unusable for my purposes. I want to be able to ""jot"" down notes. I'm an author. This is not going to waste. I'll use it as a mouse but it just doesn't make the grade in handwriting or drawing. BTW, someone mentioned that Win 7 finds it as an Ipen. Not so. It thinks it's merely another mouse. Save your money and buy a tablet."
4,"Good, but you have to use the pad that came with it","this mouse is good if you use the pad that came with it.you get used to it pretty quickly.i am not sure how to right click yet, but I don't use that too much any way.i keep both mice plugged in.i will add this product to my list of incredible recommended products at [...]."
2,Difficult to Use,"People should know that the iPen does not come with any kind of ink and you must purchase the ink separately. Even if you buy good quality ink, the pen dries out fast and will need to be dipped in again after only a few letters. Also, I could not get the iPen to work with my iPhone, the ink smears on the glass cover and does not actually write notes into the phone even with the iNote app."
5,Surpassed Expectations,"I have been wanting to get a pen / stylus for drawing on my PC for quite some time now. I kept looking at the tablet / stylus ones and was surprised at the cost. Then I saw this, and figured that even if it didn't work well, the price was worth it. Well I am happy to say that I love this thing. A wireless version might be good, but the wire for this comes out of the top, far enough away from everything that it hasn't become an issue at all. I like how it feels to move using the pen instead of the mouse. You even get extra tips (although I'll bet I never have to replace mine). In addition, my drawings have improved after I got used to the nuances of not using a mouse (it is more natural for me to use a pen/pencil). If you are thinking about trying this, do it. You will be happy you did."
3,Buy the upgraded ipen neo instead of this,"I needed a tablet alternative that doesn't take up much space.I actually preferred ""Pen and Free Duo for Laptop"" to ipen for this purpose,but I chose ipen because ipen is one of the very few pen mouses that works on a linux machine.This is usable but I would recommend you to buy the upgraded IPEN NEO instead of this. (I have both.)The only difference (other than the design) is that ipen neo uses pressure sensor instead of ipen's click sensor.This makes the upgraded ipen neo better for hand-writing.Ipen feels like using a mouse rather than a pen compared to ipen neo because of the click distance.It's well worth the slight price difference.There is both wired and wireless versions of ipen neo."
2,NOT a Tablet Replacement,"I got this hoping it would be a cheap replacement for a tablet, but that was not the case. It doesn't work like one, but it's good for a mouse. Very responsive, but I found that with my computer, it disables the double clicking function. I honestly don't know how to fix that.Overall it's good, just don't look to this as a tablet replacement."
1,Don't care for it.,"I wanted to like this. The idea is right, but the product felt cheap and was more trouble than it was worth."
1,dont waste your money,dont spend a dime on this save your money and get a bamboo pen because they are top notch ones
2,needs better calibration,The calibration on this thing is awful. It is ultra sensitive so you could never get the pointer to be exactly where you would expect it with a mouse. The pointer quickly disappears from the screen due to the lack of accurate calibration.
1,Missleading Product,Does not work as advertised. Usually needs specialized pad to work at all. If you never change the pressure of writing and just glaze the surface it still does a pretty bad job at following the pattern of your hand. This product could probably be improved if I had a 2 year old throw it against the wall until it broke. At least then it could be used as a decoration.
1,I dont like it b\c...,"It doesnt have any words, its all just music and from what i know the only cd George Strait that has the song check yes or no is in the best hits box... besides this cd, but its only music no words"
5,Pickin' On George Strait,"Love Without End Amen is one of the top 5 Country Songs of all time, in my opinion, and this album is worth it just for that. All my Exs Live in Texas is funny. Maybe some readers don't understand the sounds of words, so I'll repeat some words from Love Without End Amen here: ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love. Daddies don't just love their children every now and then. It's a love without end, Amen."" If you don't like those words, try Heavy Metal or Blabber (maybe it's more your style)."
3,Had me until the end,"This book was captivating until the end - which i just thought was a cop-out. I loved the characters, the sex scenes were amazing, the writing was breezy and fun. But the ending..."
4,Well-written portrait of a slice of India,"I was given this book because I lived in Bangalore when I was a teenager. I did enjoy some of the portraits of the city, especially its view of how the city has changed over the years. But more importantly, the writing drew me in for the storytelling itself. I found myself engaged with the characters and with their situations. The stories had a good arc without overdoing the drama. There is a wonderful range of literature written by Indians who have emigrated and are dealing with cultural dislocation and adjustment. I love this exploration of similar issues, but amongst those who have stayed or returned. I look forward to hearing more from this author.For a non-fiction view of the same, I suggest readingIndia Calling: An Intimate Portrait of a Nation's Remaking"
4,"Warm, witty look at India's ""Silicon Valley""","It is a clash of new and old in Bangalore, India's Silicon Valley. The moderh Indians, the ABCD's (American Born, Confused Desai) and the Old Guard are captured with love, wit and a sharp pen. The characters are well drawn and make you wish that you could reach out and speak with them.I sat down with this book and did not move until I finished. More please."
4,Wonderful insightful look at a culture,"A friend from India gave me this book to read. She had purchased it on her last trip home. I read it quite quickly and thoroughly enjoyed each story. I really don't know much about the real India, today's India and the book is fascinating. You get wonderful insights into this culture, the juxtaposition of old and new, traditional and modern, and not only that, the writing is beautiful. Highly recommended!"
4,Nice window to another world,"The stories are a nice variety that together paint a picture of Bangalore society and social interactions, especially between those native in India and those who have left or returned to India and how the western ideas and customs they bring back affect those who never left India. I can see how someone who used to live in India, or whose parents lived in India could relate to the situations the main characters find themselves in.There are some stories involving sex, drugs, and suicide that might turn off some readers, but nothing really graphic."
3,"Unit works well, high price","For $400 I expected a more solid unit. It is made if steel, but thin steel that dents and warps easily. Fan is a cheaper plastic too, expected a metal fan. The filter does do its job fine and sound levels are better the most HEPA filters. It is a particulate filter only, so don't expect VOC filtering.Next time I will spend a few hundred more and get a better machine."
1,Beware- this does not have wheels as shown in photos,"I purchased this purifier primarily because of the small size, and I thought I could wheel it between my room and my daughter's room. However the unit that arrived does not have wheels. I am very disappointed."
1,DUO-64 is also not good!,"I had the same problem as David from San Jose. But I was lucky to fix my internal memory. Basically I had to install an older version from DUO MANGER in a Win2000 computer and tried lots and lots of times to low format the internal memory. The newest version of DUO MANAGER wouldn't recognize the player at all. I started the low format process several times right after switching the unit on, and before the DUO-64 went to a fault LED condition. After several attempts, I managed to format the player and now it's working again. Now it can work with the newest DUO MANAGER version. Just as a reminder, now I'm just using Win2000 to downloading to it and I do not recommend it."
1,Memory corrupted when running with Win XP.,"This product worked OK for me on Win 2000, but I got a new Win XP computer. I downloaded the software for Win XP, and it CORRUPTED THE DEVICE'S MEMORY. Tech support said, ""Sorry."" The device is now inoperable. I expect some problems, but the device shouldn't become inoperable. Save your money and get a more robust or cheaper MP3 player. A cassetteadapter for any MP3 player is [inexpensive]."
4,A great read,"I must admit that the main drawcard for this novel for me was the fact that I worked in a bookshop, as the protagonist of this novel does. And I enjoyed this novel - it was like reading my life story retold by Stephen Fry. This book is funny - and reaally grotesque in places and in some ways frighteningly real. Not hectically deep or life changing, this is an swift, enjoyable read."
1,How could Epson make such an awful product?,"I'm an Epson afficionado, but after having this printer I will not be buying another Epson. It has been a constant headache, frequent paper jams, firmware glitches, inkjets clogging over and over (I lose a lot of ink by having to clean jets at least 2-3 times in succession to get ink flowing again).Stay away from it. Go with a Canon or HP. Those seem to get the best reviews.It's a shame... the output really is beautiful, but it's not worth tearing your hair out."
1,What a piece of junk,"I paid $250 for this piece of junk no more than 9 months ago and now I've seen it for almost $100. Kind of tells you something about this printer. I always use HP printers but my wife said that her company recommended the Epson 925. If I don't print for a few days, the nozzles get clogged and you have to waste paper cleaning the head and unclogging the nozzles. As I run Windows XP Pro and the printer is on a USB 2.0 and have the latest Epson 925 drivers, I seem to only get two pictures printed and the printer times out. Another waste of paper. If this the best Epson can do, you'd be foolish to buy an Epson photo printer. I'm dumping this printer and going back to reliable HP."
1,Bad drivers and operating program,"This is a replacement for an older Epson Printer. It has good prints. I have windows xp. I have nothing but program trouble with this unit. Contacted Epson, no reply on how to fix the problem. After printing a photo, I have to shut down my computer and restart it so I can print on this printer of my HP lazor Jet printer again. I also have a HP Lazer Jet B&W printer. After every use of the Epson my lazer jet prints a page with a small smiley face in the upper left hand corner with an arrow next to it. Tried new driver downloads, Still has same problem. I think this might be a good printer, if I could get the unit to work properly. Tried a Epson 960, same problem. I would never buy another Epson, because of the bad programs."
1,Epson 925,"I purchased this printer to replace a 3 year old Epson 900. After 3 years that printer had become ink-logged. It smeared ink over everything we tried to print.The Epson 925 is doing the same thing after one month of use. We went through a color ink cartrige within the first month even though we were not printing color. The simple act of cleaning emptied the cartridge, which needs to be done often in order to print at all.I actually purchased the printer from Best Buy. I asked for my money back. Too bad, it actually worked for more than 14 days. Please contact Epson. Epson says please contact your reseller.Do not buy this printer or any other Epson for that matter unless you are just looking for a paper holder. If you actually need to print more than once a month, buy something else."
2,A Dud,"I have purchased Epson printers for years, and normally I am fairly satisfied. This design however was obviously not tested. As others have said, the paper very easily jams, the nozzles clog frequently and easily, and the printer drinks quite a bit of ink. I currently also use an Epson 2200, which has ended up costing less because it does better with the ink (ink is where these companies make their money of course)."
2,Great (when it works)....,"This printer is now discontinued. I note that it still shows up for sale (both new and used), so I decided it's still worth mentioning (and warning). I bought this at a show where the dealer was printing a continuous photo-paper roll of on-the-spot shapshots of customers. What a great demo!The problem is, that's about ALL you can do. If you happen to print nothing for a couple of days, one or more printhead colors clog up and require multiple ""cleaning cycles"" to restore. It is no exaggeration to say that I've expended far more ink in getting ready to print than in actual printing! Given the cost of the color cartridge, it is a really expensive printer to operate.If you print both B&W; and color EVERY DAY, it might(?) be okay; but it's definitely not a purchase I would repeat."
2,Frustrating and expensive to upkeep...,"When it finally prints, it's fine. Not great, but fine. But sometimes it takes forever to clean the heads. I'm on around my twelfth cleaing in a row and... nope... still clogged. And what's killing me is it's just three of the black jets. I've been wasting my color ink on every cleaning. Time to sell this piece of trash and start using some online service."
4,Great quality printer!,"I purchased this printer a few months back, it is a good printer.First I would like to say that I've read other reviews on this printer stating different types of problems people where having with it. In the time I've used it, I have not experienced any problems with it. Print quality is excellent. In fact when I ask people to try and tell the difference between the printed copy and the copy from the film developers they end up picking the copy I printed, thinking it came from the developer. In fact my printed copy comes out more crisp and clear. It is a bit slow printing, but I think that's why the picture comes out so great. Besides I won it on Ebay, BRAND NEW for $56.00. You sure can't complain about that! Good Luck!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I've been on the phone with customer service many times for this printer. I was even sent a replacement printer, but both printers have the same problem. If you leave it on for more than five minutes, it will require at least two head cleanings, wasting expensive ink, in order to print properly."
2,Avoid this like the plague,"Photo quality was very good to excellent. Overall, however, this printer was an incredible disappointment. When my Epson 750 started to go downhill after a few years I bought this for my department, thinking it would be a good replacement. Well it's good when it prints which is about 30% of the time. 70% of the time, for no reason whatsoever, it would print 10-70% of the document and then simply stop -- as if ordered to do so by some higher power. I have no idea why. Nothing in the manual explained this. I reinstalled the driver and other software dozens of times. Our computer techs at work could not figure it out. Advice from the Epson support staff suggested installing the ink monitor software which we did -- none of this worked. Sometimes, after reinstalling the driver the printer would print 10 pages (of mostly image layout drafts) successfully then start to do its usual stopping in the middle of a document. What's the point of owning something that does this?"
1,No more Epson printers for me!,"As others have pointed out: Good News is that it prints handsomely when it works. All the rest is bad news. Incredibly poor user interface with tiny text on a dim LCD screen and buttons with labels like ""1"" and ""2"". Wouldn't matter except you'll spend more time working on the dang thing than printing with it. Inkjets clogged every other day, then finally one clogged up permanently. I wasn't at all sad because it was such an unpleasant printer to work with. Paper jams, paper tray falling off, slow boot-up, consumed ink like a drunken sailor. And What Ink! $50 a pop. Lasted about a year. I never even tried the roll paper option, but you could tell that would be a bear to get working right.My previous Epson printer had been OK, but I threw this one into the garbage bin with a particular glee. A very frustrating machine. I'm trying a Canon next time. With NO LCD DISPLAY."
1,Worst Epson I've ever owned,"This printer would be a poor value if it was free. The print quality is good and it does not seem to fade like HP ink. The problems are a poor paper feed that routinely picks up 3 or 4 sheets, an ink system that clogs continuously (requiring head cleaning many times a day), a tendency to smear ink on the pages, and very high ink consumption."
5,The Best I've Ever Owned!,"This Epson 925 printer is the best I've ever owned. I've owned HP, Lexmark, and Compaq. This one is just the best. Easy, reliable, can use multiple types of digital camera cards, cheap ink refills and cartridges last a long time. I like it so much, that I bought a second one for my son. Highly recommend!!! Works great with XP Professional!"
1,Do not use with Linsys pps1uw print server,I wished to use this with the Linksys pps1uw usb print server. Could not get it to work. Received a message during install of the printserver stating not to use the epson spool manager. I was using windows 2000 and there is no epson spool manager program for 2000. Still waiting on both Epson and Linksys to return my email as both of there phone queuqes are a wast of time. If I can make it work I will repost so that others do not feel my pain.
4,Legendary Quaterback,This is a book for a true Packer fan. It talks about the career of one of the all time great Packers. I really enjoyed this book being a die hard Packer fan. When entering college there was the fear of being drafted for the Koren War thankfully he wasn't and went on to have a great career as a Green Bay Packer. Bart born in 1952 played at Alabama before playing for the Pack. He a good career there winning several games. I reccomend thid book to any die hard Packer fan.
1,Dorman EZ Drain,Quality not as expected. Drain started to leak thru the valve about a month after I installed it. I would not recommend this product.
3,Read instructions first,"The only reason that i did not rate this item w a 5 star rating is really due to my own negligence. i installed the product, like another reviewer stated, using a 22"" socket i think. but this is not the right way to install. if u do use a wrench just tighten a 1/4 turn cause if u over tighten, like i did, the threads will separate and render the device useless... the instructions do state that u should hand tighten only, so unless u are extremely weak there should be no need for a wrench. i will probably buy another and do it right this time. so i did not rate w 5stars just because i dont know how well it works with oil in the engine. but the concept is there"
1,not worth reading,this book was so dry it had very little humor in it....it was a total waste of time and money
2,"Unconvincing stories of ""supernatural"" events","This book is like most of the other books in this genre. The stories all involve people claiming to have observed or possessed psychic phenomena of one form or another. However, they are all presented in a sensationalistic manner. Alternative explanations are sometimes put forward, yet they are all so obviously weak that they can only be described as a straw man.The supposed events involve poltergeists, a young Indian boy with knowledge of a past life, ghostly apparitions and precognitive dreams. None of them can be considered significant evidence for such actual events, as the circumstances are in no way above suspicion.The late Carl Sagan often said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. These claims are truly extraordinary, yet there is little put forward that would convince anyone who was not already a believer."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD SINGER???,"I must say, I'm not too impressed with this cd, I bought this cd expecting to hear the old singer and I turn it on and hear some jimmy eat world wanna-be singer with horrific lyrics. the music though is amazing as usual. I'm just not happy with the singer, the old singer had a very unique vocals and a much better voice."
3,What a Story,Even in politics the credit for mediocre decisions are fought over. Is it just me or does John Dean want to write himself into every important or at least not illegal decision that was made in the Nixon White House? With that being said this book does give the reader an interesting view into the process the President goes through in selecting a Supreme Court Justice. I have to imagine that this process has not changed much in the past 25 years. If you have also read some books on the Nixon administration it is interesting to get his view of the people and the relationships. The author also gets a lot of criticism from his former co-workers in he White House every time he puts out a book so that says to me that he is either telling something they do not want told or he is just hated. If you are a political junky then this is an interesting book to read.
3,only ok,"I initially found the core flex at the Sharper Image for much more money. Amazon had it for much less and with free shipping, so why not. The unit arrived in a rather beat up box with the parts scattered all over inside. Some of the parts did not fit well and were difficult to fit together. The machine itself is only ok. Don't look foward to awesome abs anytime soon."
2,not impressed,"I can't tell that this gives me any type of workout. I don't feel anything in my muscles after doing many, many reps. I bought it to tone my legs, stomach and rear-end and it has done nothing for me."
4,"Aw, Darn-it!!","I have owned this for about 6 months, using it almost daily. I am disabled and it really helped to adjust my back between chiro visits, and to tone my whole body. Last week one of the bands broke (my machine came with 2). I've been looking for a website for replacement bands for 3 hours. How disappointing! I really loved this machine."
2,disappointed,"Although it looked lovely on screen, the necklace was so shiny it didn't look like silver, and scrolled part of the design was clunky, not delicate. Although the sapphire was pretty, the overall effect was cheap. I returned it."
3,"Interesting, but...","Pretty good book. Some of the stories are great - my favorites are from test failures. Some of the safety procuedures were very 'seat of the pants', as should be expected when the rules are being written as you go. Gave me a new appreciation of the bravery of the engineers and support staff involved.I still think the book is missing something. Not sure if it is context or some of the technical depth. I found Titan II: A History of a Cold War Missile Program to be a better history of US cold war missile development than this book. Dry, but packed full of information.What I really want is a history of Polaris which is not on its bureacratic success or a 1960s fan book."
5,Awesome insider's view!,"This book is definitely worth the money. I got it recently and pretty much devoured it right away. Note that it is a moderated book, so there are many voices present in many chapters. In addition to the Atlas `steel balloon' flight vehicle design and construction, it also has a lot of information about the impressive civil engineering effort that went into the construction of the launch sites. It also has a detailed write up of the December 1958 Project SCORE, achieving single stage to orbit decades before it became a NASA mantra. To the authors of the book: THANK YOU for sharing all the early anecdotes of the Atlas program in this book, I enjoyed it immensely."
2,Nudity Not Appropriate for My Infant Son,"I love all 5 of the books in this series, but I just returned this one with the Matisse artwork.I just felt that pictures of a bunch of BUCK NAKED PEOPLE sitting around playing instruments and a group of BUCK NAKED PEOPLE dancing around in a circle just weren't appropriate for my infant son's collection of books right now (well, maybe EVER). I wish someone had told me BEFORE I had purchased it . . . it's more than just 'bobbing sailboats' and 'tickled toes' . . ."
3,Color Not Too Good,"The color reproduction in this book is off somehow. Also it includes a couple of Matisse's nudes. His nudes are not detailed, but still - - if one is particular about that sort of thing."
3,"Great for home, not school","I ordered a 4 pack of the Mini Masters books to share with my preschool class, and this was the only one with controversial content. I wanted to teach fine arts to my 4 year olds, but there were 2 pages of nudes that I would not want to explain or justify to any child, parent, or my boss. However if you're an art-appreciative parent, you might find this book useful at home. I think I'll just hot-glue the pages together!Instead, I wish the authors had included some of Matisse's more famous, less controversial work (like Icarus or The Snail, though I know those are paper, not painting.) Matisse is a great artist to share with children, and I think the book could have been made more public (less pubic) friendly."
4,Ms. Hardy does it all!!,"This is simply put, Francoise Hardy's take on the folk/countryish music that was popular in the 70's. Like a French country record, in the vain of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Francoise really makes an amazing record that most anyone would love."
3,A country and blues oriented album,"This album isn't bad, but it is certainly not one of her best. The majority of the songs have a shockingly marked American country and blues flavour, which in my opinion doesn't match very well with Franoise Hardy style, although a few songs (""Cafard"", ""Bowm, Bowm, Bowm"", ""Bruit de fond"") are quite charming. If you're a fan of those styles, however, you may find this album appealing. If not, I recommend you to buy other Hardy releases as ""La Question"", ""Comment te dire adieu"" or ""Soleil"", which are all excellent."
4,It does as it says.,"It does as it's supposed to but 2 things I didn't like that I'm not sure other products may have the same issues with...1. The straw kept falling out.2. If you compress it for too long, it ices up. It scared the heck out of me. I was cleaning INSIDE my computer, my graphics card fan and suddenly, it started icing up. It scared the poop out of me. I thought I had ruined my graphics card. Luckily, my graphics card is fine. But I will not use this again inside my computer. No way!But for dusting out the computer keys and the dust inside the computer fan (outside the tower) it was great. Just be very careful using it inside your computer tower."
4,Upside down chill,"There is not a bunch you can say about a can of air. Its just a metal tube full of compressed air.I can contest to the Fellowes name. Now I am a computer guy so I have used a few cans of this stuff before and the Fellowes brand has always been consistent. If I went to a big box store and saw a can of Fellowes and a generic next to it for a buck less I would go for the Fellowes because I know what I am using it for and I know how long it will last me, no telling how long that generic one will.Now if all you are doing is blowing equipment off in a shop and not really needing anything portable I would recommend you getting a air tank or a small air compressor but if you need portability I would go with Fellowes Air Duster."
4,good and useful product,"good and useful product. Cleans the extreme angles in keyboards and CPU box, but the price seems to me a little bit high though"
5,My computer is like NEW!!!,I have a computer since 5 years and on the last year it started to be very slow and the vent was making a huge noise.In only 5 minutes I cleaned all the dust from the computer. Now my computer is like new!
5,anti-abortionist at large,"Drawing on his years of experience on platforms debating the abortion issue, Dennehy shares with the reader through a number of autobiographical incidents what it is like to go before various audiences, hostile and friendly, to make the case for defending the life of the preborn. A reader is impressed by Dennehy arguing on philosophical and biological, not religious grounds. This is something that has especially impressed those who have heard him speak; his argument is based on the principle of human life there in the womb from the beginning, not on the rhetoric of emotion. He makes a most convincing pro-life exponent."
2,Doesn't deliver.,"Not as comprehensive as I'd hoped, instead of arming the reader, (as it promises in the title), with irrefutable material to pursuade others, it disintegrates into the author's sickly sweet sentimentality and personal experiences. Not a good primer for a pro-lifer to draw from...more of a pablum auto biography."
4,Good Stuff,"Many chessplayers concern themselves with memorizing hundreds and hundreds of opening moves. What they don't understand is the ideas behind. Here is a solid book which does not go too deep into openings, but explains the ideas behind them. Along with the openings, Mednis shows master games which were won becuase of solid opening play. A must for a chessplayer who is ready to handle openings theories, but not just memorizing them."
3,Unnecessary,"This book is really unnecessary. If you first study the basic opening principles found in most any beginning chess book and then play through the opening sequences of the games in Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move and/or Nunn's Understanding Chess Move by Move, then you've already accomplished everything (and more) that this book might help you accomplish. You can save your money."
1,TO MANY MISTAKES!,"The method aproached by the author to convey hid ideas are good. The way he lucidly explains the opening priciples are excellent. As you continue to the games that illustrate the forementioned principles you will find error after error. When I mean errors not weak moves that are outdated in grandmaster chess, I mean typos. You wont finish this book without being angry and frustrated."
1,notation problems,"Just a quick heads-up for people planning on buying this book - its in the old notation 1.pq4 instead of 1.e4 I bought it since it was highly recommended, but had problems reading it.hth,Arvind"
5,Fun from beginning to end,"Sure, the plot is silly. What do you expect when the premise is that a tadpole caught in Loch Ness turns out to be more than Uncle McAllister bargained for? The Mysterious Tadpole is a rollicking romp, rich in absurdity (Only after Alphonse grows four legs and reaches the size of a Volkswagen does the teacher conclude that he's not an ordinary tadpole.), and chock full of Steven Kellog's usual hilarious illustrations. Grab the nearest child, curl up in a big chair, and enjoy The Mysterious Tadpole."
5,This is one of the best books we have read this year!,"We are second graders from Scott Magnet School in Topeka, Kansas, and we think this is a great book for kids! We like the stories and the pictures. We think the pictures are cute. We think other kids should read this book too. Louis and Alphonse are good characters who teach us about being friends. We hope you like this book too! Written by Mrs. Heil's second graders"
4,Just Roll with It,"Receive a gift of a ""tadpole"" from your uncle in Scotland, and you better be prepared to just roll with it. Fortunately, that is exactly what young Louis does as he takes on the responsibility of raising a tadpole into what turns out to be quite a mysterious looking ""frog"".As Louis's frog outgrows every container, and swimming pool available, the story gets wackier and wackier. But as so often happens in a Steven Kellogg story, good things can come from unexpected places. This is a perfect K-2 read aloud book that works well when studying life cycles. Students will be drawn into the story thinking it's just a simple tadpole to frog tale; and they will laugh out loud when Alphonse turns out to be a more mythical beast than first believed.Accompanying products you may want to consider:Mysterious Tadpole Book and Toy Package,Seasons and Changes: The Mysterious Tadpole / the Caterpillar and the Polliwog / Time of Wonder"
2,Not for the Kirby 2011 Sentria,"We have to use a large rubber band looped around the dust tube and the cardboard around tube attachment point on the bag. These bags have no retainer points as the Kirby bags do. Buy cheap, buy twice. We will buy over priced Kirby bags next time, they work well with the over priced American union built Kirby vac."
2,Not so sure about this one,"I first I thought this book was a great concept, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that the criteria for what makes a ""great kid"" needed to be more clearly defined. The author cited popularity with peers as one indicator, which makes me wonder: Are we looking to raise likeable class clowns, or are we striving to raise decent, good-hearted human beings with minds of their own? Also, some of the parents' comments were very random. And when the topic of spanking came up, well, that's when I got really annoyed. The book does not present two arguments for spanking -- it actually advocates the practice, under the right circumstances. Tsk, tsk, tsk!"
3,Pigmy Love Circus,"If you're interested in buying this CD just because of the Danny Carey connection, then it is a big waste of time. However if you're interested in buying this CD because you want to hear some devilish, and at times, disturbingly funny good ol' hard rock, then it could be worth your while. The lyrics and stinging style, for some reason remind me of GWAR, or perhaps Green Jelly, which is always a plus. Even so, the album isn't all that wonderful, though it has a couple of moments, notably the first song. Danny's drumming is hardly even distinguished, but if you listen closely, you can hear the drumming similarities between this band and Tool. But, keep in mind, that the bands are very different."
3,think twice,I have purchased Intrakera from a salon for years. This was my first purchase from this vendor on Amazon. The Intrakera I was sent appears lighter in color and diluted. It is not as thick as usual. I won't purchase again.
3,"Just ""So-So""","This was not very thrilling, in my opinion. I will not write a synopsis since that has been done several times already (and done well) on this site.Fritz Tullis stumbles onto a murder and continues stumbling through the rest of the book. I never really felt engaged by any of the characters as they were not very well fleshed out. I found parts of the story to be implausible, such as the fire and its aftermath. The scene on the boat seemed very forced, a clumsy plot device to tie into later actions by Tullis and others.The most intreesting parts of the book were the descriptions of the locale for this book...the Eastern shore of Maryland. I liked reading about the flora and fauna of this region, as well as the Tullis family's landowning history."
4,As Free As Ollie,"Over-indulgent Fritz Tullis, a boozing womanizer who has been fired from his professorship at the University of Texas, finds himself in the middle of a murder mystery involving an Assistant Secretary of State and a wayward whooping crane named Ollie. Fritz has escaped to his family's plush retreat in Maryland where he plans to mend his bruised ego by drinking and taking pictures of Ollie. Instead, he accidently photographs a murder and his R and R is suddenly ground to a halt. While he attempts to keep his life simple, the people and circumstances that surround him challenge his sense of integrity and valor.The story is well-written with enough suspense to keep it interesting. The personal growth of Fritz Tullis is what I most liked and will remember. When faced with the challenge of his life, he grew from a sniveling,selfish man trapped in his one-tracked mind to an honest empathic adult with the freedom to make healthy decisions."
2,freedman blew it this time,"This book is probably one of the worst i have ever read. I have all of Freedman's books in my collection and bought this one blindly. The plot is well thought out, though already used a lot, but fleshing it out was lost in the drinking, sex and foul language. I normally would put a book down and kiss of the author after a couple of chapters with the language alone but i plowed thru to the end thinking it had to get better but it didn't. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I especially did not like his mother (who did nothing wrong in the whole book) getting killed just to keep the story going. Bad Bad Bad book karen nelson"
4,A great summer read!,"J. F. Freedman creates some very interesting characters in this book. Fritz Tullis, the main character, is a forty year old male Nancy Drew. Only difference in Fritz and Nancy is that he has experienced the many pitfalls life sometimes takes you prior to reaching the forty years old birthday. A very light read for relaxing during the summertime."
2,Disappointing,"For an author whose books usually keep me on the edge of my seat,this book really dragged. I forced myself to finish it and regretted the time I spent reading it."
3,Not bad - but not his best,"Not a bad story and not badly written, but ultimately very predictable. It lacks the complexity of Against the Wind. It would also have been nice to have a protagonist who had at least one thought that wasn't about himself."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This One!,"Save your time and money and pass this one by. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot implausible, the emotional tone of the ""hero"" that of an adolescent boy. The writing is so flat I couldn't even force myself to finish it. The tension and suspense of a good mystery are completely lacking. In all, I found the book thoroughly disappointing."
4,Enjoyable!!,"This story was pretty good, but I don't think it was much of a thriller. The most interesting was Fritz and his love for the birds. And the most disappointing was the killing of his mother. Why? I didn't think that was necessary. Also, Fritz and Maureen fell in love too soon. Still I liked the story. I hope to read more about Fritz in future novels."
1,Read no further,"Unless you need something to waste your time. If you went to great lengths to identify an individual at a murder scene, that has been captured in a photo, would you identify only one of the three? Implausible waste."
4,Enjoyable read,"My wife and I both liked this novel, and we're really not sure why anyone else wouldn't. The main character is slightly damaged goods, setting aside career and life's other ambitions, and hiding away in the boonies enroute to an undecided future. Not sure why that's apparently such a poor choice for a protagonist who is cast as an unlikely hero, but it did work for us. It's not realistic for all storybook heroes to be alpha male over-achievers who never take a step back to recover from their failures and disappointments.I appreciated the author's brevity of language, and ability to make the characters accessible and real. The storyline kept me interested all the way through.When I finished the book, I went looking for more by the same author. I was happy to add this one to my list of favorite authors."
1,Hablar ingles para niños,"Si no sabe ni decir hola en ingles este ,libro le sera util, es un cuadernillo, nada de libro, muy basico y eso de hablar ingles facilmente deberia ser "" hable ingles en 100 lecciones"" de las cuales este cuadernillo vendria a ser la 1ra y 2da lecciòn. Muy bàsico"
1,Very disapointing item.,"I was very much looking forward to this peddle machine since it claimed to be both compact, silent, and easy to use. Unfortunately, all three things did not pan out. While the exerciser is very slender, it is still much to tall to fit comfortably (or at all) under almost any office or home desk. Because of it's tall, narrow built it was also extremely prone to swaying side to side or even falling right over. Furthermore it's operation was far from silent, and while it didn't produce the same ""whir"" sort of sound a cheaper peddle machine did, it had a very distinct, ear-bending ""Rrrh-Rrrh"" sort of sound. Perhaps the sound was a side effect of the broken unit I received, though, as the tension settings didn't work at all. Despite reading the directions and checking online, no matter how I tried to set it, it was stuck on the lowest/least resistant setting. At least Amazon was very polite and helpful in getting me a refund."
1,Pedal broke Off!!,After using it on a daily basis for about 3 months the right pedal broke off.I tried screwing it back in until the threading on the bolt got so worn down that I couldn't do that anymore. Overall it is a piece of junk with the timer being broken and not displaying the lower half of the display. I only could see what my speed was and nothing more. Overall it is a piece of junk and I'm no longer buying from the Isokinetics company
2,Needs a yoga strap or other canvas strap to work,"I couldn't use this for actual exercise until I figured to wrap a 6 foot yoga strap under and around the back legs and then through a chair's legs. The nonskid feet are useless and you just end up pushing the pedaler away from you if you don't attach it.My display stopped timing after the first day, and the difficulty gauge doesn't seem to do anything.So why did I keep it instead of returning it? Because with my attach-it-to-the-chair-you're-sitting-in trick, and pedaling fast, I got my heart rate up to about 135 beats a minute for half an hour - that's in my target heart zone. We have a small house, it's tough for me to leave my very high-maintenance family for long enough to go to a gym, and the weather in Chicago often prevents me from regular bike rides. At least I get a legitimate aerobic half-hour in with this thing."
5,Great machine,"I can get a nice workout while watching TV. Very easy to go 30to 45 minutes at a clip. It does slide on carpet, bought 25 pound hand weight and placed on front of stand to correct."
4,"Good unit, good exercise",The mini cycle works as advertised. The unit is extremely quiet and offers easy control of the resistance. I would suggest that there be a way to lock the resistance knob in a position as it moves rather easily. That is the only complaint. A worthwhile purchase.
3,"Decent, but flimsy","I've been using the pedal exerciser for just about a month now and it works mostly as advertised. It's not very strong, but is great for someone with a knee injury like me who is trying to re-build up lost strength. If you're thinking of using this as a replacement for a good bike ride, look for something else.One warning on the poor construction: within the first week, the knob on the front broke off. I had loosened the strength for my girlfriend to try out and when I retightened it, the knob came right off. I've found that I can adjust the tension using a wrench, but it's simply too expensive to ship back and get replaced."
1,Lousy performance on a potentially good idea,"The pedal exerciser is not heavy enough and is unstable, causing it to move around excessively, preventing any kind of sustained pedaling at all. When you start pedaling, the machine moves from side to side because there is nothing to hold it down. The ""anti slip strips"" are useless on a rug and on hardwood. As the machine moves from side to side (even if braced against a wall), it angles back and forth, causing you to bang your ankle bones against the pedal sockets. There is no use in moving it anywhere to stabilize it. Even if I was willing, I could not attach it to the floor/ground to make it stable enough to use. I do not know why it is being sold to anyone."
3,Good work out while siting on your sofa,"I couldn't afford the gym, so I decided to invest in the Isokinetics pedal exerciser. It really is surprising effective. I worked up a sweat on multiple occasions. The problem, however, is being able to maintain an even pedaling action. After a few weeks of this, I did develop a pain in my knee due to uneven pedaling. Eventually, I did get a gym membership and started with spinning classes, which I discovered were much more effective and induced fewer injuries than the Pedal Exerciser did."
4,great for granny,"My granny is 95 and still as active as her 95-yr-old body allows her. She is fearful to mount her exercise bike after a tumble this past summer, and she misses the low-impact activity. She was skeptical when she opened her Christmas gift, but once we assembled it and set it up for her, she leaned back in her TV chair and started pedaling with a smile.It's great for her circulation, and the tension is adjustable enough to suit her needs. It's heavy enough that it doesn't move around too much during use, and it's light enough that she can slide it away from her chair when she's finished."
4,Very Interesting.,To see the very differnt ways these poeple coped with the tragic events of the Manson Murders was surprising and touching.
4,Good read!,"This short novel is conversational and informative. It's a charming piece of historical fiction; well researched, insightful and fun. Especially enjoyable to anyone living in San Francisco."
1,A Rush of Dreamers...,"I have made several purchases of books from 3rd party book sellers through Amazon, and ALL of the previous purchases were ""Just like New"" and I was VERY pleased with them all... Until now... This book has all kinds of library stamps on it, stickers from the library, and stains on a number of pages pages. Frankly I can't recall how the condition of this one was described but this one is in appalling condition, and I will make sure never to purchase anything from this particular seller again."
2,Uninteresting Chatter - now available in paperback!,"I read this book some years ago. As a sophomore in high school I was required to read Ms. Craven's novel, ""I Heard the Owl Call My Name"" and loved it. Needless to say when I saw this book and the author's name, I was pretty excited.Unlike ""I Heard the Owl Call My Name,"" ""Again the Owl Calls"" is a biography of the author and is in no way a sequel to the prior novel. As a few of the other reviewers mentioned, Ms. Craven does recount personal tragedies and triumphs. Quite a bit of it, however, feels like dry chatter with Grandma about a mundane day she had in 1957 when she worked for ""that guy"" in his office.The writing itself is good but much of the subject matter is bland. I found the book disappointing and couldn't recommend it to anyone except those who really yearn to have small talk bound in book form."
4,Again calls the owl,"Interesting, particularly when M. Craven talks about writing ""I heard the owl call my name""."
2,Demo Album,"Junkard was one of the best bands of the late 80s, early 90s. They were better than almost all the headbanger ball bands of the day except for GNR, Motley Crue, and Skid Row. I still listen to both the title debut and Sixes, Sevens, & Nines. Buy both of those albums and skip this release of demos and poorly recorded live tracks if you don't have them. I bought this anyway because I haven't heard anything from this band in over eight years. I grew up in DC and followed Brian Baker through Minor Threat, Dag Nasty, and Junkyard. All completely differently styles and attitude, all great. Too bad I can't find out if he's in any new band."
3,The Tyde - 'Once' (Orange Sky),"Another so-so neo-psychedelic release as 'Once' is the band's debut CD.Didn't exactly blow my mind out of the tap water,but it's an okay disc.The Tyde has three members from the group Beachwod Sparks.Tracks that sort of caught my attention were the Byrds-influenced ""Strangers Again"",""Your Tattoos""(nice guitar solo)and the lengthiest cut here,the nearly ten-minute ""Silver's Okay Michelle"".After playing this disc a few times,you just might experience a Buffalo Springfield flashback.A decent CD to play on a fall Sunday afternoon."
4,Warm and melodic brit pop from California country rockers,"I heard about this band because I like Beachwood Sparks and this band has 3 members from the So Cal Flying Burrito Brothers' influenced band but they don't sound anything like it. It's got an upbeat Brit pop sound with catchy melodies and it sounds like a record they made because they wanted to, not because it was a record they actually expected people to hear. It's a bit awkward at times, a great trademark of some Beachwood Sparks' tunes, but it endears you to the music, with you showing your soft underside to share the awkwardness. It's a catchy record, not mind blowing or truly experimental but just plain good music and sometimes that's the best review you could give an album. It's worth finding."
1,Attention all ghost hunters:,"For those who have short attention spans like I do, this book is not a book of haunted places. Other than that, it has a weak story also, and isn't really worth reading if you're into horror stories."
4,Good quality but slow on everything,"The quality of the furniture is quite good for the price, however they are really slow on shipping (about a week later than scheduled days) and everything else. There was a missing small part and when I requested to receive the part, it took them a long time to get back to me that they don't have inventory and it would take 8 to 10 weeks to make it!! When I asked what other options I have, I was told I can go the store to buy the part and submit the receipt. I can't say they have bad customer services, but it is frustrating to deal with such a slow paced company."
5,I wish I would have read this book sooner!,"I read the other reviews before buying this book, and though many of them said it was amazing how many similarities they found with their own situations, I was still surprised at how much Dr. Warshak hit the nail on the head in our case. It helped to realize we are not the only ones going through this, and it helped to have someone give good, practical advice- including how to accept the very real possibility that the alienation may not be reversed and the relationships restored for years, if ever. Well-meaning friends and relatives can't possibly understand the dynamics between child and alienated parent- I never would have believed this possible if I hadn't witnessed it. I wish I would have read this book sooner as my husband and I made many of the typical mistakes cautioned against in this book."
5,Good book,Great book for divorcees with kids. Real life examples and practical ideas for any parent who's ex is using the kids against him like tools to fuel their bitterness and resentment.
4,"Helpful, but...","This is a wonderful book - the author is experienced and knowledgeable about parental alienation syndrome. He makes recommendations that I really appreciate - I would not have thought to do some of the things that he's recommending. He also addresses the problem of your ex bad-mouthing your extended family - the child's aunts, uncles, grandparents, and so on. This is VERY helpful. Anyone going through a contentious divorce should read this. It has helped me tremendously.My only complaint is that he seems to be repeating himself; saying the same thing again and again. I feel as if the book could have been chopped in half! But again, this is a must-read for parents in this type of situation."
5,Divorce Poison,"This book should be required reading for every family court judge, lawyer, and family counselor that works in the divorce industry.My husband and I are living the nightmare that his ex has created and the courts still don't or won't recognize parental alienation-we aren't even allowed to say the word in court. I just wish we had this book several years ago."
5,Prior to learning about PAS....,"Prior to learning about parental alienation, I was not able to make sense of thesituation. I have told my child that so many times, ""I just don't understand!""Things weren't adding up....now they do."
5,Divorce Poison,"This book is great. I fit one of many parents in it. As a mother, it took me a long time to read because I was crying too hard to be able to read it."
5,Everyone must read!,"This is a perfect book for what I was looking for. It describes someone I know to a ""T"". I feel like I could have written it myself! Dr. Warshak is so insightful! Now I just need to figure out how to get the courts to recognize these behaviors and how to ""punish"" vindictive exes....."
5,a very accurate book,"This book met a very strong need to know about parental alienation. Having your child be brainwashed by your ex is not something many people know about. I highly recommend this book. I have used many of the methods suggested in it, with success, at least so far."
4,Great perspectives on root causes and motivations,"This book was a great read for offering explanations as to root causes of behavior and for understanding different motivating factors. It is further enhanced by lots of anecdotal stories, but more statistics and data-driven outcomes would have been a welcome addition to this subject. Although some of the coping strategies are a bit common sense or fairly weak, it is still comforting to read and know that the situations are, unfortunately, quite rampant. In being somebody dating a person who is desparately trying to cope with an ugly divorce process and lots of venom being spewed in all directions, I wish I could give a copy to the spouse-behaving-badly, but afraid it offers too many ""new ideas"" on how to behave even worse."
5,The book I didn't know I was searching for...,"If you are a divorced parent, READ THIS BOOK. If you are experiencing a high-conflict divorce that especially involves blocked access to your children, this book is invaluable. Like many other readers, I felt this book was written specifically about me and my circumstances. Dr. Warshak accurately and vividly describes the heartbreaking and all too frequent scenerio which occurs when a parent is alienated from his or her children by a contemptuous ex-spouse. The book is well written and authoritative; born of more than 25 years of Dr. Warshak's personal, clinical experience in family therapy, divorce and custody issues. I wish I had known of it sooner- I would have bought a copy the first day it was published. My highest praise and thanks to Dr. Warshak for illuminating a dark path I travel."
3,Proceed With Caution,"Just like all the others who are damaged and angry, my friend's ex told her kids terrible things about her. Her attorney decided to focus on PAS as their primary custody issue using Dr. Gardner's work as a base. It went very wrong. The judge didn't buy it. My friend was a great mom and now she has lost custody and can only see her children during supervised visitation.Read this book. Do the right thing and move on. Good book."
3,Not what I was looking for,I was looking for something that my step daughter could read and understand how and why divorced parents might try to turn their children against the other parent. Which is the situation her father and I have had to go through. I wanted something that would better explain why parents do those sorts of things and why they are not healthy. This book is written for adults and I believe is a good tool for parents to use in understanding the other set of parents actions but a child would not understand reading this book.
2,English theme park mystery that misses,"I found the writing uninteresting and the mystery was not engaging. I was disappointed because the concept of an English history theme park was interesting to me. The characters failed to engage me and the ones (the ladies) that seemed most interesting failed to develop. While death by lion was intriguing, for the most part, the mystery was predictable."
3,What's all the shouting about?,"I was so disappointed in this book! I expected great things from Dickinson; I thought the premise, a sort of English version of Colonial Williamsburg, showed great promise. But Dickinson lets us down with trite characters who are poorly developed and a predictable plot. The machinations of the antagonist are unbelievable and grotesque.On the plus side, the detective, Pibble, is well-rounded and clever, but certainly realistic as a person. There is some humor here and there, soem good interaction between characters...and the lion is just superb."
3,So far so good - a little noisy,"Since usually only negative comments prompt a review, I thought I'd buck the norm and give a thumbs up on this product. As the title above suggests, the thing is working. It is a bit noisier than the cheap $12 no-name brand we had before, but I guess this is to be expected for the power and metal gears with this one. If it quits on me I'll be sure to add another review in line with the previous ones. For now, I'd say go for it. The price is right."
1,This Collection STUNK!!!,"I am more of a big Cow and Chicken fan and was horrified that it came with an episode where something bad happened to Chicken. I am even more horrified that there won't be anymore DVDs with Cow and Chicken. If you like Chicken from the show, DO NOT GET THIS DVD!!"
1,A big bore!,"I looked forward to this one because I liked her River Devil & Irish Devil stories alot, but this was a major snooze fest! The stories were dull, characters one-dimensional & the sex was so-so. If your looking for a sexy, vamp read this isn't it. What a disappointment."
3,creole dictionary,This dictionary was very good. It helped with spelling and translating. I hope the author adds more words to it.
1,Frustrating,"Ok so as stated in other reviews no problems returning this product, although I am still a waiting collection on 2 fridges..... YES you read right 2.... the second fridge arrived in worse condition than the first, which is was suppose to be replacing. I have now giving up and cancelled my order as it appears that Sanyo is making way to much money to care about the condition of this product which appears to always arrive damaged. Don't waste your time ordering this as you will just have to start the whole process again and order a completely different fridge. Who know's how the fridge actually works :)... Happy shopping"
4,Great purchase,"I bought this for my daughter's college dorm room and she loves it! It is roomy, great appearance and size. It is faily quiet and easy to clean. Great performance! I highly recommend this product."
2,Critical design flaw means this product is no bargain & Amazon was no help,"There are 2 screw-adjustable feet in front to level the unit. There are NO feet in the back, so there is no way to adjust this unit to keep it from wobbling as it basically sits on its chassis in the rear.I can see small holes in the chassis which leads me to believe that the unit shipped to me is supposed to have 2 feet in the back. I e-mailed Amazon about it & they take no responsibility for the problem. I have to say this is the first time that Amazon has been so cavalier; the company usually bends over backwards to help its customers.I ordered the fridge on a Thurs and rec'd it less that 24 hrs later -- that was super. No shipping charges, no sales tax: also super. This fridge would have rated 5 stars from me if I weren't having to prop it up with pieces of cardboard under one of the front feet so that it doesn't wobble."
1,Good Looking Product but Bad Delivery,"Had purchased this item for a VP in office. I should have read reviews before actual purchase for I too can be a duplicate recording of most other reviews regarding damage due to improper packaging. Item seemed fine from outside except for a few wrinkles on box. Once open, the disappointment set in. While item is somewhat light, there is no way awkward size of item would not experience some type of damage while in transit. There is no corner protection at all and only some foam at top and bottom of box. Again while the refrigerator itself looked good, the damage swept away the anticipation of items arrival for use."
1,waist of time,like most of others I received this item damaged and with rocher's bugs inside!so it Definitely not worth the hassle.amazon's customer service is located in India so the connections sucks and you can barely understand their English. then I had to repack it and ship it back - i suggest pay a bit more and get reliable service !
2,My review,"The back of the fridge started to freeze up frequently and it started not to work well after about 1 year. This is why I cannot recommend it. I don't know, but perhaps its better to buy the mini fridge with a freezer as this is the second time I bought a small fridge that this has occured."
4,Good Value,"i got my frige today and like others, there were a few dents on one side; nothing major enough to return it. this is still a great value though, combined with the $25 dollars off, and free super saver shipping. the free shipping was overnight by the way, so dont pay extra to have it done. i assume amazon acknowledges the problem. i'm yet to see how great it works but im slightly dissapointed that there is no light."
3,Good looking - but will most likely arrive damaged with any shipping,"I took a chance and ordered via 1 day delivery (DHL). I won't go thru all the details, but everyone else is right... packaging is terrible and no protection for sides. I had a few small dents and the plastic feet were broken, even though the cardboard box looked pristine. I decided to keep the unit and getting the replacment feet from Sanyo wasn't a problem.It is a great looking fridge, but beware of the shipping/dammage. My only complaint on the actual fridge is that it is a bit noisy."
3,Great looking but some problems...,"This small refrigerator arrived quickly but slightly damaged- a dent to one of the sides. Because that side would be forever pressed against a cabinet here at work I decided to keep it anyway. Later I noticed that the sodas that I placed in the top row exploded- looked like the cans had been cut open with a knife but upon futher inspection I realzed that they had just frozen from being too close to the freezer. I now place the bottled water on the top row and the sodas everywhere else. There was quite a sticky mess to clean up, but all in all, I think it is a pretty good refrigerator."
4,Mainly good news,"Arrived super quick. The packing is terrible, it had 2 dents in the front door other wise i like the frig. and it is ok for my garage."
3,DENTS AND MORE DENTS,I RETURNED THIS ITEM ONCE FOR DENTS AND GOT THE SECOND ONE THE SAME WAY.JUST DECIDED TO KEEP IT VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,You don't get what you pay for,"First let me say AMAZON is great. Their service is excellent and they take care of problems when you receive damaged shipments. That having been said, DO NOT BUY THIS SANYO REFRIGERATOR, IT IS VERY POORLY MADE ! The compressor motor is mounted on a flimsy sheet metal bar. This unit is not a quality product and you would do well to find one constructed much more solidly."
1,Arrived Damaged Overnight,"Paying for overnight shipping does not guarantee this very nice refrigerator will arrive undamaged. Mine arrived, DHL Overnight, severely crumpled on one side and dented on two others.Certainly the packaging is poor and others have suggested the units were originally from (or for) Costco palletized inventory intended for store pickup.I had actually gone to Costco previously looking to purchase there and they told me the unit had just been discontinued due to unspecified supplier problems and withdrawn from all stores.Could this be because a high percentage were found to be already damaged? It surely wouldn't be the product itself, which is excellent.Whether Amazon's inventory started off at Costco and was redistributed by Sanyo or was purchased 'off the boat', this seems regretfully a problem product (or at least the current shipment) that should be avoided.What a shame."
4,Great Choice For The Room,"Sanyo makes a good fridge no doubt it works great in my room, the only thing I'm dissapointed about is that Amazon didn't ship my product properly when the fridge arrived it had dents on the bottom and on the door as well, Amazon could of protect my product from being damaged while in transit, if you order this item request protection otherwise the shipping companies don't care about it... otherwise this item works great no problems I definately recommend Sanyo."
3,"Great refridgerator for price, but packaging is terrible.",I am giving this only three stars because it came with two dents in the door because of the way it is packaged.The fridge does look nice and works fine but it needs to be more protected in it's package. This seems to be a complaint of many of the people who have posted.
3,It is ok,"I actually got this from Costco, and I am glad I did because it died in couple years. But otherwise it is quiet and works fine."
4,An Eye Opener,"I loved this book. My wife bought it for me. I listen to Maverick Investing every Saturday on 97.1 FM in Orange County, CA.Doug has taught me and my wife so much about investing and now I understand why he is so brilliant. His Father has written a great book that I will be passing throughout the family and on to the children.Thank you Fabian Family for helping us Think and Grow Rich in a new generation.BUY THIS BOOK....BUY 2!"
1,Terrible in Bear Markets,"I was curious as to why Mr. Fabian ended his backtesting in the late 90's a couple years before the book was published. Being a computer programmer I then ran the backtest for those years against the S&P500 index. Results: Portfolio Disaster. Any money you would have made in the up market you would have lost in the Bear. In short, it appears that his system is deeply flawed. He doesn't show those poor results and to me that is very serious. He claims to move money around to various mutual funds to improve his personal results but obviously you and I can't test that and I doubt it works. Use at your own risk."
2,Sales Pitch,"I'm not going to comment on the effectiveness of Fabian's principles, but I will comment on a serious problem I had with the book. The 39WAR that he relies on for technical indicators of when to be in stocks and when to be out of stocks is very difficult to find. The only place I could find it on the web was on his son's website and it came along with a rather pricey subscription to his newsletter. To me, this is a glaring sales pitch that the book predicates itself on, and to me is a serious conflict of interest.Of course, this is all not to say that his principles aren't effective, they very well may be."
5,M*A*S*H NEVER LOOKED.....ummm..TASTED SO GOOD!,"This new entry in the saga of M*A*S*H is a particular one. A cookbook dedicated to the food featured in the TV show! How odd is that, This definately is a very big collectable for anyone who is a M*A*S*H fanatic. (Like me. Check out my other reviews on other M*A*S*H related books in print! Jeff Maxwell my thanks for such a treat. We'll do lunch. :)"
5,An outstanding artist!,Wow! Great to find Winston on CD! We would often go see him play live while we lived in Hawaii. He's an outstanding artist and performer.
2,Lady Day fans beware: these are probably not v-disc cuts,"It's very difficult for me to believe that these are genuine v-discs, i.e., jazz cuts recorded during the AFM strike between 1942 & 1944. One side that Billie sings with Pops--""Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans""--is probably 1946 (or later), the year the movie ""New Orleans"" came out. Yes, it's all Billie (and therefore never less than interesting), but probably not v-disc Billie Holiday."
2,Again Another Weak Offering,"Again this was another weak offering from JJ Murray. I read Something Real and hate to say it but it was even worse. Mr. Murrary's characters are just not likable, especially the heroines. They are just downright mean and thoughtless to the men they're supposedly attracted to. And the heroe's are unfortunately wimps which is too bad because there woudl have been a nice spark if they would have given as good as they got."
1,Unbelievable!,"The author can't be serious about his portrayal of an educated African American woman who is living in the south. OMG!As an educated African American woman who married a white man back in the early 80's when it was not the norm in the Texas I thought there might be some similarities in Renee's journey and mine. The similarities ended the moment she started trash talking Jay and didn't let up. I was offended by the stereotypical characters and thought the author was beyond that, especially after reading a few of his other works: ""The Real Thing"", ""Original Love"", and ""I'll Be Your Everything"". Now those were books I couldn't put down. The characters were warm, had depth and I wanted the couple to be together. I had to struggle to finish this book and felt badly when he ended it the way he did. Really, Mr. Murray? I was holding out hope that you'd some type of redemption for the character. But alas, it never occurred."
2,Big disappointment,"I have never been so disappointed and offended by a book like this. I didn't like either one of the characters.Jay came off as being very weak. I could have sworn he was 16 the way he was acting and allowing Renee to bully him.Renee was spoiled who couldn't deal with anything without her mother. I still can't understand why the 26 year old was still living with her mother. I was sick of her saying things like ""Julia Roberts can kiss my black ..."""
4,Loved the two books; when's the third due?,"I read this book because the author is a teacher from Roanoke. Murray says he wrote the book because his students told him to ""put his money where his mouth is""; that is, if he could write so well, then do it. As an English teacher in a small town south of Roanoke, I was intrigued. The author, Murray, has an interracial marriage, and his wife likes the book, according to the author's notes. While I agree with some reviewers that Renee's blackness was a bit overstated, as a Caucasian, I have no knowledge if that's true or not. What I enjoyed about the book is the attraction between the two characters, how the families disagreed, but came together, and the feeling of romance. The book was very believable for me, and I think the author writes extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as well as ""Something Real,"" and look forward to J J Murray's next book. I hope it's soon coming."
3,More Please!,This book is a great read. I wih there were more selections in this genre. As a suggestion you should check out An Infrequent Pairing by SaFiya Dalilah.
4,I loved it,"Many people seem to think that this book was not good. Sure it was kinda unbelievable, and yes, Renee was a bit bossy, and ok, Giovanni was too ready to do her bidding. But I thought it was sweet. Giovanni loved Renee enough to please her, and she let him do it; what woman wouldn't? Renee was a little preoccupied with what other people would think of their relationship, but she still fell in love with and married Giovanni. I sat and read the book (hardcover) in a few hours; I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it."
3,Good Light,"Holding up to the excellent MAGLITE products, this light is a workhorse for outside & indoor projects and needs. Haven't used the lanyard yet but the clip and light are used every night. Also purchased an LED upgrade that makes the whole package totally worth it."
4,Not as bright as LED but stronger mechanically by far,It's a focusable flashlight and that's a plus. Was a replacement for one my wife lost.
5,Great product,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it. Very durable and can withstand her abuse.
3,Fine quality / I don't like it,"These are well known and widely used, so Maglite doesn't need my endorsement. However, I don't like the switch (the lens barrel twists) nor do I like the weakness of the beam."
4,"Cheap, simple, fun",My son is a tornado freak right now and has gotten hours and hours of fun with this toy. Simple fun for a 4 year old and well worth the price.
1,"leaked, leaked and leaked some more",just as title says....leaks a lot. My kids are allowed to play with it in the bathroom and backyard only
3,leaky,"This is a good idea in theory, but it leaks. It does the job, but you'll end up with water everyone. Luckily I only needed it for one day for a project. Also the one I got was yellow. In the picture it shows a blue one. That's not a big deal though."
4,Fun for the kiddos,"These are great fun for kids. My 3 year old and 7 year old love them. However, they do leak :( Awesome ""tornados"" are made though."
2,Cracks Easily - Cheap Plastic,"I use these in the classroom and after two uses the plastic cracks. I like to change the color of the water every so often but after taking the piece off a second or third time you're lucky if you get it back on in one piece. It's a waste a money, but I haven't seen any others."
5,It does exactly as described,"Even though it is an extremely simple little gadget, it does what is expected to do, creates a water / air tornado inside two bottles of water, it is a lot of fun watching it."
4,works well,The product works well as advertized. It does begin to leak a little after use. I'm sure you can fix it with some plumber's tape. I'm happy overall with the purchase.
2,Disappointed,The tube cracked after only a few times making different bottles. I would suggest just putting it on once and leaving it alone.
2,Very old Christian propaganda.,Originally published in 1920 by a Christian press and author. Hopelessly out of date and slanted. Maybe some helpful facts for scholars.
3,good book not enough Donkey behavior info I was looking for,When I purchased this book I was looking for something to help me along with the training of my donkey. Not to train him how to ride or drive but to manage his behavior and antick's. This is a very well written book and has lots of easy to follow instructions if that the type of training your looking for. Overall great book just wasn't what I was looking for.
3,"Great book, but so little about donkeys...","Received a signed copy (nice surprise!) of the book which I found to be well written, illustrated and quite complete, information-wise. The only comment I can make is that I thought that there would be more specific information on donkey training than there currently is. While the author's Little Jack Horner tends to prove that whatever a mule can do, so can a donkey, I wonder whether the training described for mules in this book is also applicable as is to donkeys.But otherwise, really like the book and am happy I purchased it. Will give it a try on my donkey and see where I get to."
4,A must have for mule owners,"As a new mule owner I wanted to be sure I started out on the right foot. Meredith Hodges book ""Training Mules and Donkeys - A Logical Approach to Longears"" was highly recommended so it was the first book I purchased.The content is enjoyable, easy to understand and right to the point. There isn't a plethora of ""fluff"" rather a straight forward approach to the basics. Anyone who has a mule or donkey understands that these are not horses...they are far different. While the book does indeed use well established horse training methods, the actual differences are in the well thought out execution.This book isn't meant to be a sensational media hyped method like Parelli, it is meant to make you think, to understand. But it isn't a mule psychology text either. It is exactly what the title states...A logical approach to longears."
1,Training Mules and Donkeys,"I found the book very disappointing. I have donkeys and given the books title assumed equal time would be given to donkeys and mules. Instead only one of 31 chapters dealt with donkeys and as the author pointed out there are major differences between the two. Since I don't have mules, I can't comment on those chapters. I did enjoy the pictures."
3,Good over all,"The frist chapters are good backround infromation. The recipes are done in metric, and are well written as to the steps to make the products. With some knowlage of baking you can do these here in America. Some of the recipes are for very ruial areas of the world, ie: use cow-dung for the fire to bake one of the breads. Over all good info for setting up a bakery."
1,No substance. Many pointless anecdotes.,"No useful content that you haven't seen a dozen times over.By removing all the rambling, poorly written anecdotes this book could be condensed down to a pamphlet or a magazine article.Summary: Save 10% of your income, invest in low-cost index funds/ETFs, eat pumpkin pie."
1,This book is too simple even for a neophyte.,"I bought this book on a recommendation and I was very disappointed. There is almost no content of note in this book and indeed a good editing could shorten this ""book"" to maybe 20 pages.For anyone but the rawest, newest, most life- inexperienced investor, this book is a total waste of money. People interested in the title of this book and interested in doing their first bit of research on investing would be far, far better off looking at Burton Malkiel's book: A Random Walk Down Wall Street. You'll end up with the same lessons and unlike this book, it doesn't take 200 pages to say what could be said in 20."
2,Wasn't worth the money I spent.,"The author strays away from the main topics too much. Don't waste your money. Two good books to read that are much more comprehensible are ""Exchange Traded Funds for Dummies""., and ""The ETF Trend Following Playbook"" by Tom Lydon. All the Index Fund knowledge you could ask for."
2,So so,"It's not much more than a magazine article, a tiny book. 174 pages of 5""x7.5"", and lots of repeats on the central theme. The information presented is good for those who have neither the time, interest, or ability to actively select investments or to manage a portfolio. A simplistic approach to investing, an approach perhaps better suited to the market environment of the late '90s."
1,Too simple for beginners,"I read as many investment books as I have time for and ran across this book. It is a very simplified asset allocation type book with some silliness thrown in (Pumkin Pie recipes, etc.) Anyway, there are books that I treasure and reread and refer to. There are books that I read and put on the shelf and may refer to over time. There are books that don't fit my investment style so I donate them to the library. And then there are books that go to the landfill. I think this book is resting peacefully under a few tons of garbage right now."
3,So many more words than necessary,"Everything worth knowing in this book can be covered in 10 pages. The author spends way too much time, and ink, telling the reader all about how investors have better things to do than follow market trends...Things like, risking your life on the side of a mountain, or making cookies, or just being a darned cool urbanite who's always emotionally available. Whatever. Point is that the investment technique works because it's based on sensible asset allocation, something he spends precious little tine discussing considering thats the crucial part of his plan. You can read it in two hours, so the time investment isn't terrible."
3,A quick read,"If you are looking for a quick read and are really too lazy to do anything else to educate yourself, this is a good starting point. For those with a little more gumption, I prefer Paul B. Farrell's book, ""The Lazy Person's Guide to Investing."""
2,Not enough substance,The author makes a good case for index mutual funds but there aretoo many digressions about the author's extracurricular activities.Do you really want a pumpkin pie recipe in a book about mutual funds?
2,Too much repetition and strays from subject,"This book could have been reduced to one third of its already small size if it did not repeat whole paragraphs two or three times and if did not BS repeatedly about the author climbing Mount Rainier and Pumpkin Pie and golf putting (what has that to do with a financial book, anyway.) But then the book could not justify its price. The entire book could be summarized in one page: Invest in Index Funds, Diversify, and Ignore Wall Street.Instead of this book, I would recommend several others written by Daniel Solin: The Smartest Investment Book You'll Ever Read and The Smartest Retirement Book You'll Ever Read. Solin presents information in a clearer format, with very short, but many, chapters and summarizes each point at the end of the chapter. Plus he covers more topics in the same book size since he sticks to the subject and does not BS."
1,Lacking,"Nothing unique to be found here, just a bunch of rambling. Nice pumpkin pie recipe on page 80, though. Look elsewhere for investing info."
5,"""Coffee House..."" changed the way I invest!","I was very skeptical when I first found this book. I am a poor reader and have found few books that can keep my attention. I have followed the stock market for the last 14 years and had a reasonable understanding of how it worked, this book helped me capitalize on my knowledge.It is easy to read and understand, it keeps you interested and the chapters build upon one another. I originally bought two copies one in paperback and another in hard back. I have ""leant"" both copies out and the borrowers have enjoyed the books so much I am going to have to purchase another copy for myself.If you feel like you are throwing a dart at the Wall Street Journal to pick stocks or think you might be paying too much to your broker, read this book!"
4,"Quick read, cut to the chase materials","This is a very concisely written book about making the investing process as simple as possible via the indexing approach. I finished reading this book in one night. The examples sited by Bill Schultheis are interesting, often quite amusing.The key to successful investing is to follow a few very important rules, such as maintaining diversification and balance, paying attention to cost, and stick to the plan for the long term. Bill is an excellent teacher. He lays out the arguments with intuitive evidence that it becomes very easy to ""get it"".The topic of asset allocation was a bit sparsely covered. This is the only weakness I could see for an otherwise excellent introductory book on investing."
2,Just okay,"This is a slim, folksy argument in favor of stock index funds. If you haven't seen the light, you might enjoy this, but if you're already in the cult, you can save your money. Barely even mentions bonds."
3,"Concise, but short on substance","The book is short and sweet and (mostly) to the point - invest in broad index funds, invest over a long period of time, and don't worry. That, and meandering discussions on mountain climbing. There, you preety much don't have to read this book now, unless you want to see some nicely put together tables."
3,Some good advice for beginners,"The part of the book that is most worthwhile is the asset allocation discussion, particularly in chapter 4. Schultheis explains well what diversification means scientifically and goes through how the addition of certain asset classes can increase expected returns while decreasing volatility. This discussion alone is worth the price of admission for readers that are hearing about small cap and value index fund tilting for the first time.If, however, you're already a book or two into asset allocation study, then you'll find nothing here more than just a quick easy read on topics you're already familiar with though still interested in. Not bad, but other reviewers are correct about it being short on substance.For more in depth asset allocation reading I would recommend Ferri and Swedroe."
4,"sensible, reassuring, easy to read","as someone who always feels as if i'm missing the boat with regards to my investments, this book was easy to understand, put some of the enormous gains that one hears about it in perspective and made me feel much better about my portfolio's performance."
5,Excellent Guidance for Novice and Experienced Investors Alike,"There are those who deride Schultheis' book as simplistic, but I believe the plan he lays out works for investors of any experience level. I wish I had read this, or something like it, when I started investing over 25 years ago, because I'm certain that my investments would have performed better than they did. If I had to recommend any book on investing this would be it. The book is simple, but not simplistic, and it's written to be understood by everyone."
5,"Investing Can be this easy, Really! Read on and prove it!","This review will be short... Simple, and to the point. This should be a must read for anybody even remotely looking at investing. Period. End of Review. You can stop reading now. I read it, and checked it against my portfolio and was horified to see that he was not only right, he was right on. Our Indexed funds consistantly aproximated the market average, while all my other funds were way up one year, way down the next one or more, while year for year, I did better with the indexed than with any other investment vehicle.It is common sense for all of us. Of course wall street doesn't want you to know this, if you did you would stop pissing money away buying into this fund or that one.More importantly the time I will save not putzing around with my investments, (usually to their detriment) I plan on investing in writing a book. In short, getting on with my life.Great advice, Heed it!"
1,Cutting teeth very brittle,I have used a number of spot weld cutter in the past and this one did not function well. All welds were center punched prior to drilling and the cutter teeth sheared off even with minimal pressurethe first time you became slightly out of alignment. I had misplaced my HSS center drilling cutter that had lasted for years. Replaced this unit with one from Harbor Freight for $4.99 and was able to drill out the 60 or so welds on my truck bed with no damage to the tool. I will say the arbor on the Blair unit is of higher quality than the one from Harbor Freight. Despite that fact the Harbor Fright unit is still sharp and ready to cut again if needed.
2,Low end Blair cutter. VERY brittle teeth!!,"I purchased this tool to drill out spot welds on a 1963 Chevy II SS. The teeth on these cutters are VERY brittle! This thing lasted MAYBE 12 spot welds. I followed the directions to a tee and still had the teeth shear off.I ended up buying another 3 pack of replacement cutters since I was already invested. Big waste of money. The first one I put on didn't last ONE hole. I sheered off 4 of I think 6 teeth in a matter of seconds.I am not saying Blair makes crappy products, but if you have more than a few spot welds to cut, invest in a higher end cutter (which I know Blair makes!)"
2,Not Leatherman quality,"I bought this knife for $21.00 during a Friday sale on Amazon. To be honest, I think that is about all I would ever pay for this model.The negatives:First off, there is no carabiner clip as advertised. I thought this was an Amazon error but the manual does describe the ""500 series"" knives as having them.Second, the pocket clip is removeable IF you don't mind hearing the screw and washer rattle when you re-assemble the knife. I don't like clips so this is an issue for me.Third, the sheath pictured above is not the one you actually get. The sheath I got is too tight for the knife and does not close properly.Positives: The blade seems stout and they claim it is 420 steel. Also, the rubberized grip is easy to hold.All in all, I would spend my money on a Spyderco Byrd model or a Benchmade red class model."
4,"mmmmm,that southern fried rock.","This band is somewhere betwee Brand New Sin and Down,real close to Texas Hippie Coalition.Hard,but with southern style leanings in the play.Tryit.You'll probably like it."
4,"Imaginative, but a bit shallow","Make no mistake- Nine Gates is a very imaginative book. Pulp-indian philosophy in the hands of this author makes an exciting (if sometimes confusing) read. Unfortunately the book is skin deep; its simply a good adventure story. Mr. Brugalette does do a fairly good job of drawing the main character, Gopal, and his mentor Vyasa. However, the other characters are less 3dimensional.The ending is a good one, though... Gopal and Citty have a whole world to rebuild, and you get the feeling that change is in the air. Dharma is dead, the author tells us...This book is a good way to pass the time, but don't look for anything too deep here."
5,outstanding behind-the-scenes look at STTNG,"I found the biographical information on Stewart very interesting and well done. Plus, the book gives a great look at the happenings behind the scenes during the making of the Next Generation television series. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and had a hard time putting it down."
4,Sling,"At 3 am one morning, I tripped over my computer bag in the dark and fell. I knew I had dislocated my shoulder because I felt it go. I didn't realize I also broke my arm. I reset my shoulder and apparently my arm at the same time. I sat there wondering what to do. I wasn't dressed and couldn't move my arm. Even leaning to get up hurt. Amazingly, I went back to sleep that night. The next day I realized I needed a bra with a front closure and a sling to keep my arm immobilized. I orderd both on line. This sling was great. Not only did it help immobilize my arm, it made it obvious to people not to jostle me. The only problem with it was that it really isn't ambidextrous. The thumb loop is really set up for a right arm injury and it was awkward on the left. But it was a life saver to have the sling!"
2,Maybe my sling was defective?,"I'm not a fan of this sling. There are 2 big issues with it - first, the sling itself is a really, really rough material that you really can't wear with a short sleeve shirt, and the other is the strap, which no matter what I did, wouldn't lock. I ended up going to the drugstore and buying some crappy five dollar POS sling that actually worked much better."
2,Not What I Expected,"For the price, it was an okay purchase. Very cheaply made, strap falls apart easily, which can be painful if your arm just falls unexpectedly. On another note, it looks nice, it has a better look than the ones you buy at big stores. Personally I wish I would have paid a little more for a stronger model cause it hurts pretty bad when the strap comes undone."
3,night shirt,This was a nice shirt BUT I ordered large the shirt said large but it must have been labeled wrong. This shirt could have fit two of me. I liked the fact it was cotton but am afraid to order another one.
3,Gift for my daughter living in Missouri,"I have no way of knowing how this product was viewed as I sent it directly to my daughter who lives in Missouri and has late state ALS and cannot move, speak or anything other than blink to questions with yes or no answers."
4,Chilling and thought provoking.....,"Peter Stark deserves acknowledgment for his writing of this book. Truly a different and creative way of looking at adventure writing. As a teacher, I enjoyed the science behind the mishaps of would be adventures. Often in outdoorsy books the author embellishes the facts to fit his character and plot. Using factual science, Stark weaves his tails with accuracy as much as possible. In the end the stories are chilling, exciting, and relevent to a young and active generation of adventurers."
4,Excellent light and educational reading,"""Last Breath"" makes for a very good educational read on many different ways of dying. The information in the book ties together the psychological and physiologcal factors of people in extreme conditions, and also provides some helpful information on how to increase your chances of survival.Other reviewers have commented negatively on the characters being fictional. I felt that had you not been told by Peter Stark to begin with, it would have been difficult to know that they weren't real stories. Furthermore, the use of fictional characters allowed the author to include all of the important details and circumstances that can occur during a given struggle, in just one story."
5,Look great in the middle of garden or flower bed,These have great contrast next to my Crape Myrtles. Red and Pink myrtles make these really visible from the street. I planted them in August they are now blooming in the middle of September. Highly recommended!
5,Made Me Laugh,"Ordered this not knowing what we were going to get, but it's a surprisingly funny, funny little video (not so much spooky), featuring ""Shockenbull,"" a very strange TV host who hallucinates rodents running around his house. Several comedy sketches are sprinkled among the Shockenbull story. Hysterical parody of mac vs. pc ad, and a safe sex lecture to make you rofl. At 50 minutes, it runs a little short, but well worth the price. Our college kid will be playing this for his friends on Halloween night."
1,..........yawn...........................,"New Age Muzak. Nothing like his ""Hardcastle"" or ""JazzMasters"" discs. Limp."
2,Ho hum.,"I like Alternity; a very nice rules system with a pleasant, if not terribly inspired space opera setting and an X-files style modern setting. This book is a psionics add-on to the base system that provides some interesting genre notes and a minor additions to the rules, but, to be honest, the core rules cover it in plenty of detail for most purposes (I disagree with Thomas Denmark over this, obviously). If you want to go into a lot of psionics related detail in a game, maybe think about this book. Otherwise, pass."
2,Information that should have been in the core rules books,"I almost wanted to give this product 3 stars, because the production value is very good, but the content is too lacking in material. Psionics are such a basic staple of science fiction, and this book treats it in an adequate, if uninspired manner. Apparantly the purpose of this book was to provide generic information to be used in any kind of campaign, but it comes across so generic that it has no flavor. Alternity is a noble attempt, but drops short of its goal of creating the definitive sci-fi game. The fact that the information in ""Mindwalking"" is in a separate supplement is proof that Alternity is lacking. Note to Wizard of the Coast: next time you do a sci-fi game, put a full treatment of psionics in the core rules books."
5,YUM YUM!,"""It's the Bear"" is a fun book to read aloud to young children. It's simply written, in near-rhyme, with lots of opportunity for the reader to whimper, yell, growl, and sniff. My son loves to holler some of the lines along with me. The drawings are great, with an absolutely oversized bear grasping a huge teddy bear of his own, and eating a bite-sized picnic that he stumbles upon.Very enjoyable, a great bedtime read. I'll be getting more by this author."
4,SO much fun!,"My husband found this book, and had to have it for our little boy. It's been a favorite since he was 12 months old. The suspense and silliness are great! Just be prepared to read it over, and over, and over and over and over again!"
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!","THis book is adorable. Buy all the bear books.Teddy, freddy, and eddy. So cute!"
2,Warning ** No Return Policy,"Buyer beware! This product is sold on Amazon through Tech Depot, and Tech Depot has a NO RETURN POLICY for this camera!

4,Powerful Act,Chris Thompson continues with his powerful voice. This album shows his talent and his ability to change with the times. Great CD for Chris Thompson fans (the voice of Manfred Mann's Earth Band).
1,1 star too many,"This is the worst cd I have ever bought. His lyrics and style are just weak. Save your money. I should have bought the new Hanson album, I would have been more satisfied with that."
1,THIS KAT IS WACK!,"spit-fire flow but damn his voice says it all, just look at dude, shoulda left his MC'n in his basement, dont buy nor even download these tracks, end of story"
2,This album wore thin for me pretty quickly...,"This guy has a great vocabulary and some pretty good rhymes. His delivery is a little forced, though. He tries so hard to be clever it gets in the way of his storytelling and the point he's trying to get across. This is good for the first couple of listens-- there's a ton of novelty value-- but it wears thin REAL quick. I do not see this guy having a long career. If you want an MC who is crazy and witty while keeping the flow, try Kool Keith."
4,Hella Short...Nice All The Same,"This CD is crazy. While not the best Rap CD to come out in the last little while. MC Paul Barman is able to captivate his audience with a good flow, and some interesting lines. The only drawback of this CD is the length. While the 6 songs pack a mad punch, this is a CD that probably is not worth the price, because of the length, or lack thereof."
5,Paul Barman strikes again,"What more can i say? MC PAUL BARMAN takes the hiphop underground by storm. Im still holding on to my hat, the momentum of this CD is beyond excellant. A MUST BY! His lyrical rhyme scheme is brilliant! He takes you to the end of the universe and back with a single verse. Check him out. The prince paul production is awesome, (frickin awesome) =). BY THIS CD!"
5,A Conversation Piece,"Very sparingly among my scattered years have I heard a piece of work that taps into the human spirit so deeply and so broadly as that of ""It's Very Stimulating,"" by MC Paul Barman. His soothing voice and spiritually lifting lyrics leave one gasping for air after submerging themselves in the almost meditative state that inevitably accompanies the Barman experience. He has created a sort of Bible for the deciphals of the new millennium. His influence will spread as wildly and as rebelliously as his hair, and no one will ever watch the Super Bowl the same way again."
2,Not enough but too much!!,I used this book for an ENT rotation. Great review of anatomy and cranial nerves. Not enough for pimp questions. Most of the ENT section was only periperally realted to the real practice of ENT. Pictures were worthless. I honestly believe the surgical recall ENT section is better as long as you read up on all surgical cases.
5,My favorite set of dishes.,I take these dishes with me - everywhere I go. I insist that my parents feed me using these dishes. I also insist that restaurants serve my food on them as well. I love them.When I grow up - I want to be just like superman - except not as feminine looking as the last Superman.
3,Just okay,"I like several of the tasty bite meals, but I have to say this one is my least favorite so far. The lentils are kind of tough to me, the skins are quite hard. The spices are okay. I will likely finish what I have, but I probably won't buy this again. The Madras Lentils are far better."
4,Nice surprise !,"I think this item is very good especially for a packaged product. I've not found anything that would rival the quality of taste, price, or convenience. The taste is full and spicy, tending to the medium hot side, but then I don't eat hot food on a regular basis. The texture is nice and firm to the bite, not mushy. It's especially tasty served with rice and makes a great side or lunch since it needs no refrigeration until opened. I would buy this again as well as try some of their other products."
5,FAST HEALTHY FOOD,This is one of a few fast and easy foods I like to bring with me to work.It requires no cooking and is also great warmed and mixed with rice or as a starter to a great meal.It is only as limited as you are.The combo's you can use are endless.It is VEGAN friendly as well!!
4,Decent Indian cuisine in minutes.,"For those of you who like Indian food, and do not know how to cook it, or want to spend the time preparing the cuisine, these are a good way to get a decent meal on the table in the time it takes to make rice. Though not as great tasting as the Real Deal, they are okay. Our son is at college, living in an apartment, so makes a lot of his own meals. He loves these as he knows he can have a meal on the table in 20 minutes. These are also a good way to introduce those who have never had real Indian cuisine, since most are not that spicy/hot. Buying an individual pouch can be expensive, but once you find ones you like, buy a case. They keep forever in the pantry."
5,Stylish hand-painted chessmen,"As advertised and pictured, these are rather stylish chessmen, hand-painted in red and black with gold and silver trim. They come sturdily packed in a largish styrofoam spacer inside a cardboard box; mine showed up unchipped, which is all I could reasonably ask. They do have a delicate feel to them, so I doubt I'll be intentionally knocking them over anytime soon... but they're chessmen, not green army men, so I don't consider this much of a drawback.I would've preferred some sort of felt on the base, but that's it."
3,Item not bad,"After reading several reviews of damaged goods received, I still went ahead and ordered the product. Unfortunately, I also received my item with a ding in the front cover at the top. I will most likely never order a small appliance from Amazon again based upon my experience and the reviews read. The item is, however, a nice fridge. It is what I wanted--only a fridge, no freezer."
3,Be aware of additional charges,"Quickbooks has been known to allow those of us with a bit of accounting literacy to manage our business finances. We recently purchased Quickbooks basic after doing a fair amount of research. After loading we discovered an additional charge applies to update the payroll tax tables. Yes, you want the tax tables to be accurate but charging [$$] to update them on a new software program doesn't seem customer focused. While they do provide one free update the payroll tax tables stop working ... so you have no choice but to pay and update.Setting everything up was fairly straightforward except for employee tax information. The help desk will be happy to assist you - [$$] for 20 minutes or [$$] unlimited time for three months.I really have no problem paying for service however this additional bit of information was not found on Quickbooks web site nor on the software box."
1,QuickBooks Upgrade problems,"My 3 year old QuickBooks suddenly stopped working. A dialog box asked me to re-enter my long-lost old registration number. Intuit said that QuickBooks only operates for a limited number of times before it requires one to re-enter the registration code. Even though they believed that I did not have a ""pirate"" copy, I was told that they did NOT HAVE any way to give me my registration code. That meant all my data was locked up forever.I protested that this effectively stopped my business. Was there no solution? Well....I could upgrade for $...And if I did upgrade, they would immediately give me a code to unlock my data! I paid the $ on my credit card....Bought Peachtree. Transfered the data.[...]"
1,Quick Books 2003 - ....,"Some improovements in the tax calculations, but very poor in modified accounting entries. Owner's manual shows very little, free ""help"" on line doesn't address important basic navigation and tasks in the software. Technical Customer Support available only after payment of a minimum twelve months support contract.Customer feedback nonexistent. It was a wrong choice."
1,No customer service,"Please start with a different accounting software. Intuit locks you into their expensive payroll updates that you could input yourself if they would let you. Manually typing in the government info for payroll checks every payroll doesn't sound like good computing.... but $169 a year sounds like ""GOOD PROFIT."" I like the program... but extremely dislike the management. Moving to another program.Unhappy"
3,Quickbooks Basic Review,"I like this version of Quickbools very much, because it is easy for a small business or a non-profit business. But you can no longer get update for it, and are unable to register it online. One would have to purchase the newest version of Quickbooks. One should not purchase any Quickbooks laster than 2009."
1,Time consuming to install and negligible improvement.,"The installation is tedious and non-obvious. Moreover there is no succinct description in the documentation as to how to migrate files from version 2001. The default installation script for Windows XP did not function without some modification. And Norton Personal firewall must be turned off, while down loading all the patches and up-dates of which there are many. The only reason to buy this product is because Intuit's 2001 version will not function with contemporary versions of Internet Explorer, therefore if you use a current version of Explorer, and are doing a re-install of the product, you are forced into the up-grade, which for my business, offers no, as not any, value added, features."
1,Not worth your dollars,"This PDF download is nothing more than *extremely* light, couple page, anecdote regarding the role of the COO. I found it both lacking in content and insight. With extremely large print, and being only 5 pages long, it appears to be more a ""teaser"" that would appear before a substantive discussion of the topic in a magazine, rather than an article itself. This is the first time I've posted a review to Amazon, and I felt compelled to do so because of the very poor quality of this product. Amazon don't destroy your reputation for quality product with e-articles of this extremely poor caliber. Readers - don't waste your money on this. Even at the low price offered this is not worth your time or money."
1,Disappointed in the Amount of Content or Lack Thereof,"I should have read the other reviews first and saved myself $3. This is a ripoff for an e-document and I'm going to find out if I can get my money back. Maybe the number of pages should be presented so as not to think that the Title is more important than the content, which was lacking."
1,Should have had a latte instead.,Awful. Outdated. Brief to the point of non-existent. Should be removed from Amazon.Go and have a coffee instead and cruise a couple of blogs.
4,A dark glimpse into the future,"It's hard to believe music can be this abstract and original, yet fit into a well established genre and even sound like other artists. The CD begins with a kind of monotone mish-mash providing the backdrop for what sounds kind of like the Muppets being tortured by a dentist. Not something I throw on to get a party going or when my Mom's over, but that's not the point. Vladislav Delay meets Autechre -ish, but this is music that attracts different listeners for different reasons. Avant-garde, but for the aficionado who enjoys straining a little for their art. Often dark and disturbing post futuristic ambience, highly visual. The peaks come with noise intensity, not beat or rhythm; closer to ambient. I wouldn't call it essential, but its concentrated density of noise (or lack of noise) is thought provoking, engaging, and ahead of its time."
5,Colorful and Pretty Keds,"I ordered this shoe for my mother and she loves it! It is so colorful and it would be perfect with a yellow or green outfit. This line of Keds gives the ""dressy"" person the option of being casual without sacrificing style! I'm hoping it will be as comfortable for her as it is adorable!"
2,b-grade movie.,"This movie was made to show the lovely bodies of the well endowed ladies. There is no real plot to the movie, or real acting. But all the ladies have great bodies. Watch it if you do not think a storyline is important."
5,Fellowes cutter lubricant,Purchased to lubricate the confetti cut cutters on my fellowes Ps 77c shredder. This was purchased for preventive maintenance to ensure cutters keep working. Lubricant designed for these type cutters
3,it helps but,"but really it doesn't have to be that kind oil and food oil can do the same exact job ,,it's just the bottle you will need some a bottle with the same head so u dont make a mess"
4,"Relatively Expensive Oil, but Long Lasting","Fellowes Shredder Oil, 12 oz. Bottle with Extension Nozzle (35250)This oil amounts to about $14 a quart. Expensive yes, but it will last a long time if dispensed through a small pinhole and used every time the basket is full.The oil has no smell whatsoever.I have found that before using, I must completely remove any paper particles from the cutters by running the shredder in reverse, getting rid of any paper and then lifting the motor (after locking the mechanism) and discarding any visible paper bits. Otherwise, applying oil before performing this procedure will result in oil-soaked paper residue and over time, the shredder then will then either jam or not operate."
3,The product itself is okay but figuring out how to open the bottle was a little tricky,"There were no instructions on how to open the bottle, so I used scissors to slightly cut the tip off, but it wasn't enough to let the oil off, so I cut some more until eventually I had cut too much and now I realized I didn't have a way to close the bottle. Now I keep this on a high shelf but because of my mistake in opening the tip too much the oils does flow rather too rapidly when I apply it to the shredder."
5,Product received!,"Product was received promptly and with no problems! THANKS! Works as advertised, keeps the shredder functioning at top efficiency. Thanks."
4,Does the job,"When I first purchased a shredder the seller said the lubricant product is optional. That may be, but it sure works better after a while if you use the lubricant! Well worth the discounted price."
5,Good oil!,Delivery was good. Product last a long time. Works very good on the office shredder which is used on a daily basis by a dozen people.
5,No problem!,"Simple review-received what I ordered, earlier than expected. Great product, great service. Thank you,J."
5,Great product.,Does what it is supposed to do. Easy to use tip and not messy as other oils I have used in the past. Highly recommended.
1,You Don't Need This,"My fellowes powershredder says clearly in the instructions that you can use vegetable oil, a much cheaper alternative, to oil the shredder. Save your money!"
5,Buy this when you get your shredder,Worth buying at the same time that you buy the shredder. I plan to just refill it with vegetable oil once it's empty.
5,Quality & sevice,"The shredder is performing exceptionally well, devouring staples and the occasional paper clip as well as a about 500 sheets of paper a week. The price was right and it arrived on time. Unpacking and assembly very easy.Excellent product."
4,helps keep the shredder working,"my shredder was slowing down, as soon as I used it my shredder started working properly again."
3,"Does it's job, but a bit messy","I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year. This time I bought the oil at the same time I bought the shredder. Now I oil the shredder fairly often, maybe even too often. The only issue I have with this product is that it's a bit messy when you ""pour"" the oil onto the shredder blades. I cut the top of the oil container as small as I could, but oil still manages to come out too fast and get on the shredder body when I oil. No big deal as I just wipe the excess with a paper towel, but it's worth noting."
5,always dependable,"If I can get it Amazon I always get it. AMazon has never failed me in promptness, ad accuracy, good packing and no walking - I'm 82. I even try gourmet stuff here and it is better and Dean and Delucca A satisfied customer for over many many years"
3,Hmmmmmm,"I decided to buy this oil because every shredder that i buy ends up in the junk heap no matter how much I pay. So, I decided to try to extend the life of my new shredder. The shredder is new so I don't know how helpful it has been yet but I guess it can't hurt."
5,Inexpensive Protection for Shredders,"This shredder oil comes in a large bottle that's easy to use and sturdy enough not avoid leaking. I use it once or twice a month to keep my Fellows shredder running well. Works great, inexpensive protection for my shredder."
2,Overpriced,The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle. I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area. I'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil. I couldn't even find this product in local office supply stores. The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $9.99. I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil. There is simply no need for it.
5,I can't believe Amazon want we to rate lube oil.,"It is recommended, I got it, it works, but I think I will try the sheets next."
5,works fine,"Not much to say here. When i use the shredder extensively, I apply this oil and run one sheet through per the instructions. Works great. Thanks."
5,WAS NOT MESSY FOR ME,"It was not messy for me like some people might have said. You don't have to use a lot. It was used when the basket was full so that if you did use more than necessary it was collected on the cuttings and leaving the basket free from any oils. To me it did seem to be cutting like it was knew when I first received it back in Nov.9, 2008 and I have shredded over 7 full baskets of paper. Today was the first time I used the oil. I know I should have used this oil earlier and often since the manual suggest one should regularly use after bin is full or if capacity decreases, motor sounds different or sherdder stops running."
3,May not be needed.,"If you purchase one of Fellowe's heavier duty shredders, it should come with enough of this oil to last at least a couple of years. At least this was the case for me when I purchased an SB97c shredder. It's kind of hard to rate this with stars because I suppose it works, but at the same time it's completely overpriced for what it is and most of the time it's a totally unnecessary item. Lastly, as other reviewers have mentioned, this must be enough oil to last around 20 or more years of very heavy shredder use."
3,RATING,THE BOTTLE IS WAY TO BIG.12 oz WILL LAST 2 YEARSIT WILL LEAK OIL THRU THE PLASTIC BOTTLE ( SWEAT ON THE SHELF ).
1,Not sure why?,"I bought a small little shredder and this ""Maintenance"" oil was shown in a small pocket on the side of the shredder. Then I opened the box and found out that I had 5 lifetimes worth of oil for the shredder it was paired with."
3,Messy Item;,I should have remembered what I read in another reveiw. DO NOT TRIM THE TIP OF THIS BOTTLE. USE A NAIL OR SOMETHING ELSE TO PUNCTURE THE NECK. Lubricant flows out of this and goes everywhere. Now I have to be extra careful when applying the product and keep a rag nearby. My fault and I have stupid stampped on my forehead. Our last shredder did not last a year and was not maintained. We will find out if this product prolongs the life of the new machine.
