2,good looking but cheap,"Love the look of the bag, but one of the zippers broke after only one month of school. Would not recommend."
4,wish it had more laptop padding,"I ordered the zebra/pink color of this backpack because it was one of few bags big enough to fit my laptop. I'm a college student, so I love the fact that it has tons of extra room for books and binders even when my laptop is in it. I have a media sized dell laptop (about 16""x11.5"") and it fits BARELY. I don't feel like its padded and protected as it could be, but besides that, I love this backpack."
4,Good Backpack,"The bag appears to be of good quality. The fabric is thick and the straps are nicely padded. I can't say anything about sturdiness or comfort as I returned it (it was to be a Christmas gift, but was delivered rather late)."
2,too small,"My son likes the high sierra backpacks....however, this one just didn't measure up. It was much smaller than the one he had. We are returning this one and ordering the Access to see if it is works out better. He is in the 7th grade and carried text books, binders, gym stuff, etc."
2,Not the best backpack around...,"I have had this backpack for only about 5 months and already there are problems with the straps tearing. I think this bag is fine if you dont have more than two books for classes, but as a grad student I normally carry around 3-4. This backpack is not the best around, but its not the worst either. If you need a bag to haul several books to class look elsewhere, but if you only have a couple of books and a laptop you should be ok with this bag. Overall I rate this a two due to the premature tearing I have encountered and the lack of space for all my books."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"I'm in law school, so I've got a lot of huge books. This backpack holds multiple books, my laptop,and various other item easily without getting overstuffed. The zippers are strong and haven't jammed on me yet. Also, the straps are very comfortable and don't put the strain on my shoulders and back that previous packs have."
4,Great so far,"It has been a month since I am using this backpack; it's been really impressive. Its inexpensive, spacious and comfortable; strong enough to carry my 15"" laptop and books. Too many zippers to open a single compartment is drawback but overall its great value for money."
2,Puny Pads,These pads are much too thin for in house use unless the puppy is very little. The edges did not keep the liquid contained.
5,celica gt model,i love it. bought it for myself couldn't wait for my husband to find a celica model for me. he tries too hard. this is perfect just like the one i drive except it doesn't have a convertible top.
4,Great Scanner,"This is the second G4010 I purchased. Like everything else it has its good points and its bad points. The slide adapter is a little cumbersome to use, the user interface could use some work, especially the preview screen when you're doing slides. But, its scans are pretty darn good!"
1,Dead on arrival,"Powered up, but carriage would not move. Spent hours with HP tech support, they tried to blame my USB drivers, which was nonsense. I tried it on several different computers with VIA and Intel USB chipset drivers. Got the same results, but HP was still trying to pass the buck. Finally decided it was a hardware problem and got Amazon to refund me. Amazon then charged me a 25 dollar restocking fee, which I thought was rather dishonest since they shipped me a broken piece of merchandise to begin with. Now I'll try Canon"
4,Scanjet Review,As all HP products this one works well. If you are impatient do not use the power saver option as it will take seconds for the scanner to start. We did have a problem with th G4010 Scanjet installation but it was our fault. I installed our old 5300 HP scanner from Windows 98 on XP OS computer and it worked till we did something different with the scanner. From that point on we could not turn off the computer till the scanner was disconnected. I removed most of the old program but I could not install the new Scanjet and HP could not help me in removing the balance of the 5300 Scanner program. I finally did remove balance of the 5300 scanner program and from then on I was home free. I learned a lesson about using older programs on the newer operating systems.
1,No Windows 7 Compatibility Yet,"Looks like none of the current HP printer/scanner models have full Windows 7 compatibility. Guess they didnt have enough lead time (or are they hoping you'll buy a ""new"" 2010 model?)."
1,"If I could rate this scanner lower, I would","HP does it again. Good hardware. The worst software and support I have ever seen. This scanner is as stable as Charlie Manson on crack. It would work one day, then not even found by it's own software a week later. I would have to use the windows scanning software or my OCR just to scan. It is vulnerable to unstable updates, both HP and Microsoft. After 3 years of this pain it finally got to the point were nothing would work. Device manager would find it but that was it.Support is useless. It's not worth the phone time or emails. Their script monkeys can barely read, let alone help. This POS is on the porch with a hammer in it and I am fishing my old reliable 6200c out of the attic. Oh, for you Linux fans out there. (Ubuntu 6.10 thru 10.4) forget this beast. Proprietary chip and HP NDA will never allow for linux driver development. So much for HP lies about Linux support"
2,Beware: Scanner will not work with Window 7 at this time,"I have had this scanner over a month and it works well with Window XP. However, the comptuter that I want to run it on has the new Windows 7 software. HP website say's that they have a driver in the works that will allow it to work with Windows 7 but they are taking their time making it available. I am going to give them another week and if no driver, I am going to take it back to Staples."
2,Lots of Slides to Scan? READ THIS FIRST!,"While both have the excellent HP software that lets you make color, cropping, light/dark, sharpness adjustments before AND after scanning, the G4010 requires that you hold the lid open with one hand and insert/remove the slides in the slot in the lid with the other! The slot is wide enough for the plastic negatives insert and too wide for slides so they tend to overlap each other. It can be difficult to get them to stay straight. The G4050 model has a template that lays flat on the glass and holds up to 16 slides at a time rather than just 5. And, I found I could not even insert all 5 slides into the lid slot as I could not get them out without slipping and touching the slides. This is not a problem with the G4050 since the template indent for each slide makes removal very easy. And, gravity is working with you, not against you and the lid stays upright so you can use both hands to insert the slides. The G4050 is definitely worth the extra $$!"
2,"No Vista, XP didnt work",Good scanner...but software to eliminate red eye or crop pictures didn't work with XP...and is not yet avail for Vista. Very disappointing 40+ telephone experience with HP and about 8hours with Microsoft.
1,Bad product,A bad scanner. Does not have VISTA drivers. Poor response from HP Scanner technical folk. Returned the scanner and purchased an Epson 4490 scanner which works like a charm.
4,It works....but,"I had a problem when I installed the program, but it works.If you installed another language already on your computer, you need to check the language version of the non-unicode program.It it is other language, you'd better make it English not to have any error while installing the scanner program.Once you had a problem with installation, it never works even after re-installation. Otherwise, you may use a default scanner program of Windows XP.I had to install it on another computer."
1,Arrived broken twice,"I ordered this scanner, and when I set it up I couldn't get it to scan at all. A few hours reading online and performing a hardware self test suggested it was a hardware problem. Ok. I returned it for another. Exact same problem. This time, 45 minutes chatting with a HP technician led me to the same conclusion- a hardware malfunction.I really urge you not to buy this scanner. Either it's consistently manufactured with a malfunction or it's so poorly made that it breaks in transport. Whatever the problem is, it's not worth the time dealing with it."
1,Incompatible features with Windows 7; Poor Support,"Purchased the scanner in November 2009 and it did not work with Windows 7. They have subsequently released a new driver but many features still do not work with Windows 7. Tech support was totally not helpful...they had no idea what to do and told me to ""wait until a new driver came out....it should work."""
2,90-Day Warranty? Forget It!,"This scanner has only a 90-day warranty. So does the 3110. I wouldn't even consider them. The only HP home scanner with a 1-year warranty is the 4050. The Canon scanners also have a 1-year warranty, and I'm leaning toward the 5600."
3,Good scanner for the money,This scanner is a good value and has all the normal basic scanner functions. I would recommend it to anyone who creates electronic documents from paper.
4,Good item,Had one real similiar that was stolen. This has been a good replacement.Very easy to operate with good software. No problems
4,Very Pleased,"The scanner worked right out of the box. Software installed with no problems on a Windows XP machine. Color rendition is just as good as other scanners I have used. OCR software works average. The slide/negative holder limits you to 35 mm film size. This is a problem if you want to scan old larger formats. Other than this one limitation, I'm quite satisfied with the product for the price."
2,A dog.,"Warning! This comes with virtually no documentation. There is a thick booklet, but it's in about twenty languages with only about 5 pages devoted to any one and most of that information is useless. You are left pretty much to your own devices. There is on-screen help of a sort, but it's so chopped and diced that it's hard to get an overview of just how to start anything. The OCR and pdf functions DO NOT WORK with Mac OS 5.X and I got NO response from HP when I reported this problem. I never was able to get a satisfactory slide scan. The seller DID accept a return--less a 15% restocking fee.The Canon CanoScan 8600F is a little more expensive, but all its functions work flawlessly, it comes with at least a hard copy getting started guide, and a single, reasonably user-friendly on-screen guide. It also has steel lid hinges instead of the plastic ones on the HP and a glance inside the workings show solid, clearly superior construction."
5,Great buy!,"Scanner all-in-one easy to use HP system. Does film, slides, 3D objects, regular scanning with depth of field as good as my older all-in-one HP copiers. The newer HP all-in-one copiers can only do flat objects. Nice depth of field, good color. Very pleased! [ASIN:B000LZEN8Y HP G4010 ScanJet Photo Scanner]]"
4,Quality for money,"We use this scanner to scan high-res detailed watercolor paintings for various apps. Great quality, easy to use, flexible options."
5,Like she is!,I This DVD is really fun to watch it shows how she dresses for the papers and has a space for her to express herself. Very fun!!!
5,raven makeover maddess,this movie is great to look at very funny a one of my own and cannot stop looking at it but i always will love looking at raven movie she is funny for children and grown- up.
1,Bad business,product ordered in mid November as a Christmas present but here it is after Christmas and still no DVD no email to say why and no warning that it was on back order...just bad business. I would strongly caution anyone ordering from this company
4,simple to put on,eazy to put on and works great...took me awhile shopping around town couldnt find what i needed till i looked on amazon
5,"Ever Been to Wildwood, NJ?","If you have like to vacation at Wildwood, NJ, you will love this book. Read the eyes-on, first person perspective on this desirable location. Learn the natural history from a leading business person in the tri-state area. It boggles the mind how things have changed!"
1,was sent an instructor's version of the book,"I received the book I ordered however, the version I received is for instructors. I have not been penalized by my professor however the book does not serve me as a student. My homework assignments have little credit because my book contains all the answers. The titles in the book that specify the book as an instructor's have been covered with black tape. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase."
3,Advice with examples from movies,"This book shows seven patterns of relationships. The examples are taken from movies (novels and ""real"" clients). If you always loved ""Pretty Woman"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Bridges of Madison County"" ... then this book might be able to tell you something about yourself. The examples are described in a very clear fashion (down to the cliché level). The author is always extremely secure on her judgments. The questions go to the reader not the author herself. I believe life is more complex than this."
4,My Dark Haired Girl was a blonde named Erin,"This was not one of Phil's greatest books. Virtually all of his Science Fiction and at least 1 ""mundane"" novel deserve more stars that this. (I use the term ""mundane"" in the usage of S.F. fandom to refer something without any S.F. elements. Nothing Phil did or thought was ""mundane"" in the more typical usage of the word.)However, I gave it 4 stars because of the considerable importance of the DHG in one of the sub-texts that runs through almost all of Phil's work: Who is human and who is android and what does it mean to be human?For part 2 of this review, please read my review under Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos) DVD edition."
2,"too simple, even for beginner. doesn't get you very far.",I had a lot of expectations for this book which were not realized. I didn't really learn much more than some simple acrobatics. anyone who needs to use microsoft office 98 in a real office (home or business) won't learn enough in this book.
5,"""The Mentalist"", the complete 3rd season","Received my order this week! It came fast and unexpectedly early, since it was an overseas order. All is great! Thanks a lot!"
4,switching to dvds because of instant video price raise!!!!,"I started using Amazon instant video alot even though I have netflix for $8 per month.I loved it!! But now they raised the prices on complete seasons by at least $14 + per season I wont use instant video as soon as I finish whats in my library.Back to netflix for me and its cheaper for me to buy dvd of seasons than to use instant video.Why change something if not broken,sure amazon will lose business on instant video tv seasons."
5,Glad to have this,"When watching tv and trying to figure out some episodes, it was nice to get this package. The reruns aren't always shownis sequence. Also it is good to go back and review some episodes to see what one misses in the first place."
2,unreadable discs,Was impressed with how quickly I received the dads but unfortunately two of the discs are unreadable. I am very upset with this.
5,SIMON BAKER IS A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF LEADING MAN!,I THINK SIMON BAKER IS VERY FUNNY IN THIS ROLE. I ENJOY THE ENTIRE CAST AND THEIR DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.THE WRITERS AND DIRECTORS ARE TOP NOTCH! IT IS A SERIOUS SHOW BUT THE HUMOUR IS JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. THAT IS WHAT ATTRACTS ME TO THESE CHARACTERS. I HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY PEOPLE TO WATCH THE SHOW.
5,enjoyable,"The Mentalist is one of those series you like to watch. Simon Baker is great as Jane, Lisbon, Cho, Rigsby and Van Pelt are the other regulars who are also really good."
4,Nice collection at a great price,"This is very simple: if you don't own these three movies and would like to, buy this set. It includes the full DVD releases of each one that has been previously released (the widescreen ""Platinum Series"" releases for ""Jason X"" and ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") in one box. The only thing you lose is the full-size DVD cases, all of them are repackaged in slimline cases with a cardboard slipcase. A perfect capper to your collection of the original ""Friday the 13th"" series!"
5,"""New Line"" Jason Slasher Collection","hey so i bought this collection after i bought my friday the 13th dvd collection from crystal lake to manhattan, plus this completes the friday the 13th collection in this set you have jason goes to hell, jason x, freddy vs jason which is the 2 disc set by the way. anyways its a good collection all in one box not 3 seperate dvd case boxs. there put into these cool thin dvd cases."
5,3 Movies For the Price of One!,Length:: 3:13 MinsA great collection of some underrated Jason movies. Check this out if you like Jason...can't go wrong for the price!
5,well-done collection for all Jason fans!,"For fans of the Friday the 13th, this trilogy pack of some of the later films in the series is a treasure. The transfer is crisp and clear and the screen is ""letterbox"" format, which I prefer.price is reasonable; makes a great addition to your collection."
4,Turning 50 gift book,"I got this for my parents when they were turning 50. It seemed to be a hit, so I guess it was a good gift idea. Might have been a little cheesy, but they liked it so I guess that is all the matters."
1,What you don't know about turning 50,Gave this to a gal friend for her 50th. It caused a lot laughter. Made a very nice giftand everyone else enjoyed it as well.
1,"Duller than a law book, with half the chuckles","I've read funnier quotes at a post-apocalypse planning meeting. I'd like to believe that as I get closer to 50 (not quite there yet--but soon) my sense of humor is growing more sophisticated. Why then a book filled with humor best appreciated by those with the most juvenile sense of humor? I don't know if the author's name really is Witte, but based upon this title, he should consider changing it to Hackneyed. After finishing this book, you won't be amused, only depressed."
1,dumb,This movie made no sense. After an hour of trying to stay awake I found that I could not understand the characters or the bad acting. Stupid ending and everyone who has watched this movie (to include myself) has lost 88 minutes of thier lives which they will never be able to make up (but thats only if you didn't watch the special features). Do not waste the money. END
1,Desecration of the art of cinema,"Bought desecration on a whim, reading all the good reviews (what drugs are you guys on??), but this movie is complete low budget trash. It has absolutely no redeeming quality except for taking the prize of being the absolutely worst movie in my DVD collection. There is art, there is ingenuity, and there is beauty, but Desecration contains none of that. It's Just. Plain. Crap."
5,"Finally, Psych-Out Horror Returns!","Wow! This nifty flick has some memorable scenes, fun sfx, and a killer score. If DESECRATION is Dante's first film, fans of this one can't wait 'til the next! At last, a new director continuing the tradition of great Italian horror cinema. Bravo, Dante!"
1,Desecration indeed,"Tomaselli displays the narrative precision and sure directorial hand of a young Ed Wood. I've seen plenty of admirable low budget movies. This isn't one of them. The problem here isn't the budget, it's the mind (make that ""mind"") behind this steaming pile of crap. I may have seen worse but I'm drawing a blank. Conclusively disproves the adage that it takes a great director to make a truly bad movie."
3,Pretty Bizzare !!,"A real weird, confusing horror story that some may say borderlines blasphmy, or just plain is ! The story revolves around a yong Italian boy at a Catholic school that accidentally kills a nun with his remote airplane. After that he begins to see haunting images of the nun returning and other weird goings ons. Not a bad horror flick especially if you have ever gone to a Catholic school as I did. The film ends up going in a million different directions, yeah you know the kind ! This really takes away from the film it begins to look like someones bad trip and by the end you will find yourself skipping back to some scenes to try and piece the puzzle together. Don't bother !"
3,"Strange,atmospheric,horror experience","This film is strange,atmospheric,sometimes creepy experience.Dont expect films with too much talking about what is going on,but enjoy experience with something from your bad childhood dreams and with deep dark atmosphere."
4,Repeated viewings make this all the more eerie,"Let's face it. Hollywood simply doesn't know how to make scary movies anymore. With all the gloss and [special] CGI effects so common in blockbusters these days, one has to turn to the indie horror sub-culture for real thrills.DESECRATION hits on several key fears:1) Nuns2) Clowns3) Hell4) Blood. Lots of blood.DESECRATION tells the story of Bobby, a young boy under an overbearing Catholic upbringing, who starts a horrifying chain reaction when he accidentally kills a nun with a remote control plane (!). Not much more can be told about the plot, mainly because the film is by far the scariest at times when the viewer has absolutely no clue what's going on. For example, in one scene, Bobby is trapped in a room where vines are tying themselves around him, and a bloody statue of the Virgin Mary is swiveling around in circles. What's the significance? I don't know, but it's ... scary."
4,Duchamp Revelry,"I am not a Duchamp scholar, just a big, big fan who has spent years pursuing my admiration of the artist, the prankster and the genius. This book revels in all three aspects of Duchamp's oeuvre not to mention it is a true joy to hold, read, touch. A bibliophile's appreciation combined with a scholarly interest make this book highly enjoyable and frankly, lots of fun. For the German scholar, all articles are printed in both their German as well as English translations. From an art historical perspective, the text is very well integrated with the presentation of artwork, which includes vellum overlays, making the experience interactive and a sensory delight. This is revelry in true Duchamp; his fun, whimsy and always revolving and diverging vision."
5,Can I give it more than 5 stars?,"I can't believe this book was published last year and I just read it this week. This book was fantastic. Hosp's first novel is one of the best legal thrillers I read and I would put him right up there with Patterson, Grisham, Grippando, Baldacci and Meltzer.I won't get into the plot or story line. If you want to read that, read the summary provided by Amazon. This book was very well written by an attorney from Boston which gave it ""legal"" credibility. The characters were well developed, the plot moved along at a very fast pace and was not so complex that you got bogged down with a lot of legal terms. Some of the murder scenes were graphic, but again this is a murder mystery. The last 100 pages are explosive and there is more than just one surprise at the ending. I hope that David Hosp will continue writing. I could not put this book down. I can definitely see this book getting turned into a movie. I'm looking forward to reading more of this author."
5,"Beautiful, colorful and large illustrations, great value for a cute nursery rhyme","The books in this series are so worth buying, they're inexpensive in my mind yet the book itself is large and pages with illustrations have the pictures covering almost the entire page. Pages themselves are easy to flip and stay open. My babies just like staring at the pictures as they are read to. Very cute and terrific value."
3,Colourful board book,"A good quality board book, but a nursery rhyme which (to me and my son) has little appeal. The mother scolding her kittens for losing their mittens and saying they will have no pie is a bit of a Victorian punishment."
4,Just enjoyable reading,This book is a fine collection of short stories by an author who loves baseball and mysticisml. Pure Kinsella ...
5,Beautiful Waterford,Received the beautiful Waterford Bowl wrapped perfectly and in great condition. Couldn't have been easier and made an amazing retirement gift for a very special person.
4,Pretty good,"Attractive to look at - Yes. Well made - Yes. Difficult to get the CDs in & out of the sleeves - Yes, and more so the further back in the stack you go."
5,Still One of the Best WWII Video's,Watched this with my parents when I was a teenager....brought my parents to tears.Still brings out strong emotions to this day. We will never forget.
3,good but dated,"what was then state of the art is still interesting but,of course, technically dated. worth seeing, all in all."
1,Looks better in picture than in real life.,This bracelet looks better in the picture than it actually is. I thought it was going to be silver but it is more putty colored and of very rough quality. I probably won't wear it.
3,Not so much.,"I don't mind that it doesn't look like fine jewelry. I wasn't expecting it to for the price. But the fastener is like an open hook that doesn't close and it doesn't lay nicely on the wrist. I have it hanging in my window as an ornament, but won't try to wear it."
1,disapointed,"I wish I would have read the reviews befor I ordered this item, Not happy with it at all,does not look like the photo.Was a waist of money and will never wear it."
3,It is what it is,"Installed on 2005 Kia Spectra 5. Install was easy and everything fit up nice. I already had an after market cat back exhaust. This made it way louder. Gas mileage seems to be worse. I don't think the loss in mileage loss is worth the maybe 4 horsepower you gain with this. A vehicle with a larger displacement engine would gain more with this product. The 130 horsepower 2.0 liter engine is pretty small to notice any kind of horsepower gain. But, it is what it is. It looks pretty cool when I open my hood and its made by K&N, so you know its good."
1,over priced,"From my perspective, this product is WAAAY overpriced! I was very disappointed -- and my eye doctor had recommended it. I wonder if he really understands.I was hoping to get a refund....."
3,"helpful, but not well made","These definitely improved my dry eyes, which is something most products have not been able to do. However, after about two months of use the pads came unglued from the mask. In addition you have to wash the refill pads with soap frequently...otherwise there is a smell from the pads never fully drying. Even though these helped I would not buy them again, simply because I do not feel they are well made."
2,not much help,"I was hopeful about TranquilEyes, but after using it (and having some compromised sleep) for 3 weeks, it has not seemed to make a difference in my night time dry eyes. While I am a sensitive sleeper, and know that not everyone is, the goggles were really pretty comfortable. I just didn't see any change in the dryness of my eyes from them."
2,Not worth the money!,"I have severe dry eye and my doctor recommended purchasing this item. I had high hopes that it was the answer. However, IMHO it doesn't work. The pads don't stay warm for longer than a washcloth soaked in hot water. And it's more time-consuming to use. The pads don't really touch your eyes and they don't seem to create steam, so I'm not sure what they're supposed to be doing. I feel like the product is way over-priced. I would be less disappointed if I had wasted $20 for this product, but $45... what a rip off."
1,Harsh for the eyes...,"I purchased this product expecting it would have the results it promised but I used it for one night and in the morning I woke up with red, tired and wirnkles around my eyes. I thought this would be something that would work but it didn't ,the only positive comment is that if you have to sleep in the day you won't notice any light.I hope this comment is helpful."
5,wonderful system,"MK makes the best saw and blades period. Thanks MK. We did about 1400 sq ft of tile, marble, granite in our new home. I didn't cut one piece and ""snap"" it to break to size, I cut everything with this saw and this blade was there to be an extra. Did almost the whole thing with a worn 1/2 blade and could have gotten away with out using this blade. My guess is you could do 5-8 houses with one of these blades"
3,"Good book, but out-of-date","This is a good book on subfiles, but it is pretty old and out-of date. It was written for OS/400 V2R3 and uses RPG III.A lot of things have changed since then.Still, it is a useful book for learning subfile basics."
4,Wonderful starting point for beginners,"I teach a group of pre-literate Liberian senior citizens and it is always a challenge to find materials that work for them. This book has great stories, done in comic strip style that provide discussion topics for us to work with. Some of the scenes are work related, which would be better suited for a general population, but this has stories on dealing with poison, fire, kitchen safety, shopping and other general things that have given us a good jumping off points. There are add on exercises that have been above my non-readers, but would be helpful in a beginning English class where the students had basic reading skills.It's been a good find, and I'm going to look for volume 2."
2,It was okay.,I thought that it was kind of dry and long winded. I thought that there would be more tricks of the trade that other training books dont' have.
5,"Positive, easy, informative","Positive, easy, informative. Great book for the busy pet-owner. I Always recommend Andrea Arden books.Easy to read.Added to my collection of recommended books."
5,Great Price,This was a great buy. The price was unbelievable for Josef Seibel sandals and the product is in perfect condition. Wish I could run across more deals like this!
4,great towel holder,works as expected...holds / hides the kitchen towels out of view.there are two screws for attaching and it's on. The total cost with shipping seems a bit high so that why 4 stars not 5...still a good purchase
4,If you like this one,"Interested in the Great American Songbook? Look up the book: The Great American Songbook: Stories Behind the Standards, by Chuck Denison and Dunccan Schiedt !"
2,"thin, unsatisfying","The taste is nice enough, but there is not enough filling to it, the soup is mostly liquid. I would not buy it again."
4,lamp oil,Love the scent but hate the price! However this is the cheapest I've found it. I did receive my shipment quickly which made me very happy.
3,Learn about Tibetan life,"My book club selected this book, and I was dreading the ""love story"" purported in the title. But this is actually a pretty neat story about Tibetan life, and since it's supposedly based on a true story, I'm assuming it's pretty accurate. I knew nothing about nomadic Tibetan culture and their environment (except what I've seen in movies), and I enjoyed being introduced to it in novel form. I also enjoyed reading the Tibetan take on the Dalai Lama conflict between China/Tibet. The book is simply written and plot slow at times, and since it is a translation, I suspect some things might have been lost. I didn't have too much of a problem with the writing, but I didn't care for all the coincidences that occur toward the end. I'm assuming this is where the book is very LOOSELY based on reality. Overall, I do recommend it."
2,Oh come on...,This book comes across as a slightly naive piece of propaganda. The Chinese entered Tibet to help them with their agricultural practices and improve public health? Yeah right.The coincidences that fill the latter part of the story are perhaps passable in a piece of soppy Mills and Boon fiction but to present then as part of a true story stretches credibility.This would make a great script for whatever the Chinese version of Bollywood is.
1,Outrageous apologia for genocide,"An apologia for 50 years of genocide in Tibet by the Chinese, disguised as an ""epic love story"". Insulting to anyone who has been involved in trying to stop the genocide of the Tibetan people and culture."
4,Worth reading,"The Messianic Seal of the Jerusalem Church is an interesting read on a topic that Bible scholars and historians don't discuss. There is little physical evidence that this three-in-one symbol actually existed in the first century or that the original Jewish-Christian Church used it. Nonetheless, the Messianic Seal is used often by today's Messianic Jewish movement. So anybody involved in interfaith ministry should know something about it. This book is the only printed publication I have found that tells the story of this controversial symbol."
2,Interesting book with a very factual symbol,Intersting book about the symbol. I first saw this symbol when my wife and I visited Israel in October of 2007 and was instantly intrigued.Endure...
4,Great walking workout,"This is a easy way to exercise. I liked the fact that it doesn't require any ""boosters."" I still felt like I had a good workout. I enjoyed the pace and the basic moves."
2,"5-star workout, 1-star video","I wish I have taken other reviews mentioning low music volume more seriously... This is, in my opinion, a great workout. It is exactly 30 minutes, does not require any equipment at all and is easy to follow. Leslie's personality is right for the job - she trully motivates you without being too perky, annoying or pushing too hard.But, unfortunately, this DVD has very poor sound and video quality. Sound is just awful. There is noise from the microphone, music is practically inaudible and the voice level is way too high. Camera work is amateurish and there seem to be someone behind the camera that Leslie and group look at and talk to all the time. Picture quality is like an old VHS tape. There are better quality videos on YouTube.Unfortunately, an opened DVD cannot be returned and now it's gathering dust on my shelf. What a shame!"
2,Not her best,"I usually love her workouts, but the camera work is bizarre, I can't hear the music, and she doesn't use the weights at all. I usually like a little weights. Clearly an older one."
4,Nice 30 minute walk....,"This is another 2 mile walking workout from Leslie. No weighted balls or other props are used, just walking away the pounds here. You see all the basic steps, plus a couple new ones that Leslie throws in towards the end of the routine, not hard to pick up.I like this workout, though it's not a favorite from Leslie, the cueing could be a little better. As other reviewers have stated, sometimes a move isn't called until right when it starts. Leslie is quite chatty in this one and perhaps gets distracted a little bit, and therefore cues late. Not a huge deal, it's pretty simple to get back on the right foot. It is still a fun routine, and I like the music in this workout, though sometimes it's hard to hear it.I still recommend this though, it's the perfect length, I use this before or after weights, or sometimes on it's own. I am very grateful to have found these workouts, they have gotten me back on the road to fitness.Overall, I give this one 4 stars. Good effort."
3,Poor soundtrack,"I have other Leslie Sansone workouts that I like a lot, but the sound quality on this one is poor. You really can't even hear the music or sense the beat."
3,Another good exercise video from Leslie,"I bought the electronic version so that I can download it to my Kindle Fire and be able to take it with me or play it anywhere in the house. The video is a typical 2 mile version of her walking tapes and is fine for that. As others have mentioned, the downside is that the music is really hard to hear so it is more difficult to keep up with the right beat when walking. I have to give it 3 stars for the audio quality - it works but her videos are easier to do if you can hear the music more clearly."
4,Leslie Sassone-Walk Strong,This walk video is very good for me. I am sixty-three and I can now do the two mile walk and I feel I am getting great cardio benefits from it. This is my third video of Leslie Sassones and I think she does a great job.
2,"I don't drink, but...","...as someone who has invested $$$ in Leslie Sansone's dvds, this one made me wonder whether the camera crew had been in a bar.Lousy, lousy sound quality (as others have mentioned), unhelpful bird's-eye camera angles, woeful background set with long, intrusive shadows (bad lighting) from Leslie's gang (who are specifically described as fellow instructors? Really? Then why are two of them wearing huge, unflattering, low-self-esteem black T-shirts - I've been known to hide in these garments myself, but I am NOT a fitness expert!), plus some of the cues are so haphazard, even the ""instructors"" flail their arms goofily trying to catch up at one point.Sansone can be brilliant - but this walk was incredibly dull, lacks the sort of perky flow between moves that make so many of her dvds a pleasure, and made me horribly aware I was just another broad wearing out the floor in front her tv."
1,A DVD Walking tape?????,"I have to take part of the blame on this one - I didn't even think that a Walking tape would be in DVD form and purchased it without thinking. Of course, the advertisement never really said DVD and of course I wouldn't think you would carry a TV and DVD player with you on your ""walk"" with the ""walking tape!"" I'm so disappointed that anyone would make a walking tape on a DVD! It just doesn't make sense. You usually walk outside or on a treadmill - not watching someone walk on TV!!!!! What if I didn't have a treadmill or a TV and DVD player in front of the treadmill - do I walk in place????? Duh. Bad choice Leslie Sansone. Worst purchase I made on Amazon.com."
5,Love it!,"Love this workout, definetly a good one for being only 30 minutes. I have used several of Leslie's walking tapes, mainly the 3 Mile for Abs, and have always had success with them, when I stuck to it! Last year I lost 40 lbs using that particular program, now that I am married with a bigger house to clean and a longer drive to work, I dont have the time for the 45 minute workout so I bought this 30 minute DVD. It gets your heart rate up and it's over before you know it. I have always hated to exercise but now I don't mind at all. If I can lose weight with her programs, ANYONE can!"
2,I can't hear the music,They must have turned down the music and upped her mic. Because I have to turn this one all the way up to even hear the music slightly. I think she does talk entirely too much but I try to tune out the talking and do the walking :)
1,Voice of the Village Idiot,"This book, written by ex-Catholic priest James Carroll, contains his musings from the pages of the Boston Globe -- the very same newspaper that shot to prominence with its Know Nothing position back in the 18th century.It presents a decidedly biased view of U.S. involvement in Iraq as well as the Catholic Church.Scholarly works by more objective and qualified sources are available. For those anxious to confirm their own biased views, however, Mr. Carroll is the perfect town crier."
4,Good Peds Book,"Lots of good information, you just have to find it. There's a lot of not-very-helpful information too. Good glossary though to help you find what you're looking for. Overall: not an easy read, but good information."
2,Great Reference Book.... Lousy Text Book,"I'm a nursing student in a RN program. This book was one of our required books. The problem with this book is that it either needs a good editor, or just call it a reference book. I hated this book not because it is incomplete or because it does not have enough information, but that it has too much information. As a student in a nursing program, I feel that the best textbooks are those that quickly and concisely give you the information that you need to learn. This tome takes too long to say what it wants to say, includes information that is unnecessary, and is basically overwhelming."
5,7th Edition worth its weight in gold,"Whaley and Wongs updated bible for paediatric nurses is essential reading now it has gone in to its seventh edition, Those who had the 1995 version will already be familiar with the fully comprehensive care plans and evidence based practice rigorously detailed within the book, but 2002's new edition not only updates knowledge but also improves clarity using excellent illustrations, and also includes an entire new chapter regarding community care- an issue at the forefront of modern nursing. This is a core text for all students and qualified nurses alike."
5,antsy nursing student,I have a hard time reading some books that are required in nursing school. However this book is exceptional! I loved this reader friendly textbook. It is very easy to understand. I wish more of my books were like this one. Thank you Donna Wong.
2,Never has so much said so little,"This thing is a beast! It's difficult to read - the space between lines is so short, you feel like you're reading the same line over and over. The material repeats itself quite often - so much that the book could use some editing. I guess the authors get paid by the word. As a nursing student in an ADN program with absolutely no interest in the field of Pediatric Nursing, I resented having to lug this turkey around. I'm sure it's treasured by pediatric nurses and educators world wide, but if you've got to buy it, get a used one or an older edition. No need in breaking your bank account and your back!"
3,its okay,i didn't really use this book too often. my instructor gave us most of the information that we needed. i found this book incredibly too long and at a pretty difficult reading level. i wish some things were explained better and not in so much medical terminology that i have to look up a lot of words.
3,Fairly enjoyable but nothing to keep you awake turning page.,"This book has been compared to Bill Bryson's The Lost Continent and Moon's Blue Highways. The comparison isn't even close. Yes,it's a ""road"" book and provides pleasant and lightweight reading but is not nearly as entertaining as the above mentioned books."
3,space out,Very Twin Peaks soundtrackish. Not rock out music but space out in the car music. The owls are not what they seem. we like.
3,Slow beautiful death,"3 1/2 starsThis dark minimalist jazz is gorgeous stuff, although the artist's limit themselves by sticking too closely to the regimen they have inked out for themselves. They perform haunted works that seem to repeat themselves thematically too often and cause your average non-predisposed audiophile to become disaffected from all the shimmering, lifeless death-odes we have never quite heard jazz records parlay. While this is by all accounts a standout sound, it is unfortunate this sensual band is intent on mining the same territory previously sought, I fear that without venturing further into this amazing palette they've rendered, this sound will play thin upon further releases. For now though, many tracks stay fresh in their utter creep into your chilled heart."
4,California Here I come,"I bought the LP some 35 years ago. The LP quality is terrible, because of spinning the record hundreds of times. At last the Japanese issued this CD. Why not in America for heaven sake?The cd is very short, it wouldbe a good idea to join the LP 'The In Sound' with Soft Samba.But I love this CD in my car. Turn on your boost and blow the roof!"
4,very good,"It's a very good video, but take notice that this one completes the other released in 88' called ""opera favorites by puccini"". Except one thing: Aragall in Tosca, is not good on high notes, I will not say as usual. 111 min. Tosca, Boheme, Manon, Butterfly, Il Tabaro (?).Except for Boheme, the great arias are on the other video, but interesting. Other scenes from Strauss, Verdi...Look on internet for more details"
1,Be warned about Kultur!,"This is yet another shoddy Kultur production. They gain access to very good productions and then do not bother to clean them up for present-day viewing, nor do they provide any liner notes. I have vowed never to buy another Kultur production because I have been disappointed too many times in the past. There are many companies that take pride in their productions. Kultur does not seem to be one of them."
5,Funny!,"I'll keep it short. The video is funny and most importantly, it has his HBO hit Critic's Choice on it. Its the full length uncensored version and it brought back some memories from the first time i watched it. The topics may be dated but it was fun nonetheless."
3,Not the best that he has done,"I saw this on tv, and I was so excited, because I have loved Dana Carver's work for so long. This was definitly not his best pefromance. Some of the jokes wer his usual funny bits and extreme, but others were just hum drum dry, and I wished that he had worked on some of his material better. I did not hate this work by any means, but I truely feel that he has better work in his catalog. I would definitly recommend The Best od Dana Carvey, SNL over this DVD any day of the week and twice on Sunday."
2,He should've stopped before Master of Illusion,"I used to love Dana Carvey. His cast (1989-92) was the strongest, most talented cast ever on SNL (I know, it's sacrilege to not say the original cast, but you know that it's true). While he may still be good at sketch comedy, he absolutely stinks at stand up. This whole concert was taxing and unfunny. I really felt bad for the guy the way the audience was half-heartedly laughing for the benefit of the cameras. Terrible."
4,Saw it once in the 80's and NEVER forgot it!,"It was on cable, HBO or Cinemax, I think. Ususally I don't go for horror. Thirst is more suspense than gore with a modern twist on vampires. So compelling, I couldn't forget it even after 20 years. It's obscure and not nearly as brutal and bloody as many horror fans prefer, but it's a gem of a story. Well directed, acted and scored. One way to describe it would be: What are modern day vampires up to?"
3,Great cult movie,"I remember watching this movie when I was very young. It had something that just seemed to stick with me, so that when 20 years had passed, I still remembered this movie. I just finished watching it today after all those years, and I still find it very captivating. The lead actress is very beautiful and innocent, and soon realizes that she is more than she ever thought she would be. This movie is pretty creepy and makes me want to keep watching. I would recommend it to anyone, though I think I liked it more so when I was a kid."
4,"Fairly suspenseful, decently acted, vampire thriller.","This Aussie movie features the fine Chanel Contouri, and David Hemmings, and is a fairly suspenseful movie. Ms. Contouri does a good job as the heiress to a weird legacy. Not sure how much was lost due to ""modification"", but Ms. Contouri has a brief ""partial nude"" scene. That aside, it's not a bad movie, and a little gruesome, but still, not as bad as today; given the times. Worth a look, if you can find it. (I was ""lucky?"" to find it elsewhere.)"
5,Thrilling,I think that this movie was great. some parts of it were a bit off the wall but the over all of it was perfect. I really enjoyed this film and i think it should be seen by all.
3,machines replacing vampires,"A typical vampire movie with a twist, not the female being bitten and the life bloods sucked out of her but strapped to a machine and the blood sucked out. The plot to turn the girl into the ""queen"" of this vampire family is a inditment of modern society who wants to control. The real question is should public be in control or a group with secret agendas be in control."
2,Baby-faced gunman,"I can't buy baby-faced Estevez as a cold-blooded killer (with hard eyes, as someone says). With guns waving around, he wipes out not one, but two, armies of bad guys and doesn't get a scratch. Har har. In this movie a wagon outruns horses, and a priest sits on a fortune in gold while his people are starving and tormented. Ay carumba!"
2,This isn't Young Guns,"Emilio Estevez is a great actor but this role wasn't for him. If you want a spaghetti western, stick with Eastwood."
2,A weak showing,"This film attempts to be both an over-the-top-action flick and a classic spaghetti western, and utterly fails on both counts. The story drags on interminably, and when the action scenes come, they are uttery unconvincing."
1,"Great for portability, that's it","it's great for on the go printing, but that's it. The photo quality is poor (especially if you're using PhotoShop, Windows, or other non-Canon printing). My print head just died after 6 months. Not at all impressed with it except the size (it works perfectly with my laptop and I was able to pack it in an attache case to travel). I am very disappointed with this product."
5,Great item to travel with..,"If you are looking for a compact printer to go with your laptop...then this is it. The only suggestion I would have to improve this printer is to have a LARGE Black and White ink supply instead of the color option.I don't need color when I travel and I am just trying to get a hard copy for someone else usually. Otherwise, it is just dandy."
4,Good Printer,"The Canon PIXMA iP90 printer we bought through Amazon was easy to connect, easy to use and does good quality printing. We mostly use it for black and white printing, but the color reproduction is excellent."
1,Canon garbage printer,"WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!GARBAGE ALERT!I have recently bought a Canon ip90 printer and have NEVER had a worse experience with a priner. This piece of trash makes Epson printers look good.Anyone who buys this is wasting their time, money and paper.Never again will I buy Canon after this horrible experience."
1,"Works great, until it dies early!","Worked great for about a month - now the cyan print head has died. Ive run the cleaning commands, replaced ink tanks, even tried manually inspecting and cleaning the head itself as a last resort - no good, Cyan is completely dead.I hope it at least lasts as a B&W; printer.Funny, the number of 5-star reviews for this product (one of the reasons I bought it!) when I see every single recent review is a 1-star horror story now. Makes me wonder how many of those 5-star reviews were early fakes by Canon reps when the product was first released.Buy something else - and not from Canon, companies need to suffer for their mistakes if we expect them to ever start caring."
3,Nice printer if you want to blow chunks of money...,"I don't usually write reviews, but this printer has made me so mad... I really must say something here. I bought this printer back in November 2006. It died last week.Good points: Print quality is excellent. Photos come out nice. Word documents come out clean and professional. This is why I gave it 3 stars--I have to be honest: Your photos will come out looking awesome.Bad points: Printer died inexplicably after only 3 months of use. This printer also eats ink like super super fast. My family started giving this printer a nickname: Mr. Pusherman. We had to buy an expensive ink tank cartridge every two weeks. It was absolutely ridiculous, like a crack habit. Canon should have advertised this printer as the printer only rich folks can afford to keep.Conclusion: If you have money to burn, buy this printer for the excellent photo print quality. If not, save your money for gas."
5,great little printer,have had this printer for several years & it hasn't given me a moment of trouble. It takes up very little room; easy to replace ink cartridges; excellent print quality! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to replace an inkjet printer.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a portable printer for work related printing needs out in the field. I was very excited when I received this printer because of it's size. Unfortunately, set up was a nightmare. I was on the phone with Canon support three days in a row and couldn't get it to print. Canon finally ended up sending me an iP100 replacement because the print head was defective on the iP90. Then the iP100 that was sent wouldn't work and I had to send it in for repair. I have never been this disappointed with a Canon product."
1,Beware,"I purchase this item from a third party seller. The product was defective - it did, nor does recognize the color ink cartridge when install. The third party refused to reimburse the defective product. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A THIRD PARTY PRODUCT THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN!"
1,Completely Unreliable,"This is the worst piece of junk I've ever had. The first printer failed right out of the box. I've had the second one for about 6 months, and it has now failed - some obscure error message about updating the firmware that I can't find a solution for. I don't have time to fiddle with equipment - I need to turn it on and have it work. Never Again!!"
4,A good printer-,"I have owned several of these canon porable printers and have been happy with them-They are easly porable(fits in my laptop case w/ease)This new does a bang up job of printing even photosWorks well right out of the boxThe blue tooth doesn't work so well and was extraIt could hold more paper, as i often have to reload mid printing"
2,"Works great, when it works. Don't expect more than 6 months...","... out of this printer. I kept thinking it wouldn't happen again, it's so compact and handy, but I've now been through three of these (one IP80, two IP90s) and I've had enough. They just stop printing one day. No funny noises, no hints that they are getting worn out. And I really don't print that much, either. Today, two pieces of paper went through (very thin, standard paper, not even the thickness of photopaper) and it jammed... a tiny wheel and spring had come loose inside... and that's it. Total of over $700 spent on these printers in the last 2.5 years. Bah."
4,Handy Portable Printer,"I bought this printer as a portable to use with my laptop for real estate transactions ""in the field"". I find myself using it frequently at home when I need a quick color print.I don't use it for photos, so I can't comment on that. For business graphics it is great. Fast, quiet and portable. The only negative I've found is the paper handling is marginal. It often will feed more than one sheet of paper at a time, so it needs attention to get a satisfactory multi-page print job.I'm using ""compatible"" ink cartridges. This saves tons of $$$ and so far seems to work fine. I'd buy this printer again!"
5,Great Little Printer,"Recently purchased this small Canon Photo Printer, and it goes well with my Laptop. Fast and a delight to use. However, a USB Cable should be provided, considering Initial Cost."
5,Nice Printer,"This is the third Pixma iP90 we have bought for our ogranization. We all love it. It is easy to install and use. It's lightwieght portability is a great plus. I have put mine through some marathon printing sessions without a pause and it has held up well. The cartridges are small, but inexpensive."
4,Love it!,"I am in love with the size of this printer. Not to mention it moves a lot faster than my outdated hp photosmart printer. The only problem is the ink tank is so small, you might have to replace often. I haven't replaced mine yet, I've printed about 40 pages but others have said they have had to replace at 50 pages. Other than that, this little printer is a marvel and offers lots of options."
5,Printer weighs less during shipping,"According to the Product Details on Amazon's Web site at the time I write this, the weight of this product is 9.0 pounds. However, the shipping weight is only 8.0 pounds!!! I guess the printer weighs less when it's being shipped."
4,Great Little Printer,I purchased this printer based on the positive reviews. It does a great job. I print mainly photos and every once and awhile a web page. It doesn't seem to format to web pages very well. But will continue trying. I really wanted it for photos which print great for my uses. It is small enough to fit in most cases when on the road or vacation. That way printing can be done right there instead of waiting to get home to see those great shots!!
3,No USB cables included,Frustrating if you're setting it up only to find that it is missing the needed cables!
4,Mobile Printer,The printer has exceded my expectations. It does just what I wanted it to do. Print fine quality pictures and have a mobile footprint.
4,Great little printer,My son travel a lot and uses the heck out of this little gem. Small and compact enough not to be a bother but large enough to do a great job.
5,"Listen, please!","Five stars. Al Green has a voice that can wrap itself around a song and make it new, something special, solid, classic. He sings without denegrating women; his love songs are from the heart, tender, without bluster or offensive male posturing (if I want that, and sometimes it can't be avoided, I'll listen to James Brown). This is some of his best music in two albums, one package--it's all here under the one roof. You can't go wrong. Unless you want to quibble over trivial sound checks (I hadn't noticed...). Buy it, pop it in, groove to the soul, let the spirit (of the music) take you. So good."
3,Didn't fit,I washed my sheets before using them. I also purchased the DobbyDot queen sheets. They all went through the same wash and dryer cycle. The Waverly's didn't fit the standard Queen but the Dobby Dot's did. I didn't try to fit it before washing. The regular sheet feels great.
4,Unique Writer,"I never heard of Jnet Frame until I saw the biographical movie ""Angel at my Table"" about her life.I liked her writing because it is unlike any other writer, she has a different slant on everything and her use of language isequally unique and well crafted."
1,One of the Worst,"I picked this book to read for the book club I belong to. I had to apologize to everyone and promise not to pick another book. It was tedious, horrible, depressing, confusing. I gave up after two chapters. It is the worst book ever!"
2,hardly heroic,"The byline, ""This time the gay guy's got the gun,"" may be the only clever aspect to this movie. After watching this film I found the few reviews here on Amazon (which initially convinced me to give it a try) to be rather misleading. In reality, this movie is just one step away from being awful. The story line was widely implausible, and the majority of the actors were amateurish and flat. Many of the filming angles in certain scenes were just bizarre. The narration during the beginning and the end was merely compensation for poor story telling, and the violence (mostly unreal) seemed far out of character with the rest of the tone of the movie. The movie does depict a moment or two where the lead characters show heart, and for that reason I give it two stars. But a successful ""gay action film"" this is not."
4,"Go Hayden, I love you!!","They should have released the song ""My Hero is You"" as a single instead. It is clearly the best song on this CD, so I will buy it because of this one song. It could've been a single dedicated to 9/11 and made profits for 9/11 charities. Hayden has a great present and future in both acting and singing. I can't wait for her first solo CD!!"
1,"skip this, get the good songs elsewhere","Raven on her own is sophisticated, but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy! As are most of these tracks not by real artists with CDs, just kids stuck together. 2 of Jesse Mccartney's worst songs - sorry!Some Chisty C. Romano tracks. ""anyone but me"" is a gem, get her EP instead. Hayden's ""My Hero..."" is great also, this girl can sing! She's also on the Ice Princess Sndtrck (""I Fly"")which i recommend in addition to ""Go Figure"" If they let her, she has a huge future!"
5,I love it!,"I also don't have the cd (yet!) but i love all the songs! I have heard them on disney channel. I love Jesse Mccartney so much! total hottie! Haylie duff is alright, but i like hilary better! lol. I love all the songs from zenon 3 and from pixel perfect. i think their songs are really cool! i am getting this cd for my birthday, which is in october by the way!!!, and i would definitely recommend it to you!Best wishes!"
1,Rip off,It says in the description that you get a box of cards. You only get one pack of 8 and they charge 6 bucks to send you that. This is a total rip off.
4,Worked pretty well for me in Japan,"I took this book to a city in Kyushu on a business trip with the goal of accomplishing some basic communication in taxis, hotels, and social situations. With it, I was able to introduce myself, ask for things and communicate basically in my hotel, figure out where to go when lost at Haneda, and communicate with taxi drivers. Where it lacked was the section with unclear conjegation of common verbs (it wasn't clear to me how to use most in sentences). A glossary of nouns would have been a key addition to build your own sentences, along with proper sentence structure information. Aside from that, the phrases were very applicable and useful, and the book was small and well organized-- easy to use. It contained fewer useless, overly-specific phrases than you often find in other phrasebooks."
5,Tracks!,"The tracks were my kind of music, CD was in excellent condition, & I am very satisfied overall - thanks, A, Murdock.."
4,Not as good a holocaust,"If you looking for a new group, or have been recomended this band, definatly give thier CD ""The Holocaust"" a try first. This CD is not a bad CD and the accompanying instrumental is a decent CD (especially if you have to do a 6 1/2 hour drive hung over). I liked the holocaust's diffrent sound, and well this has an even diffrent sound, but not as good as holocaust. This CD will take a few listen throughs before it grows on you, but all around a worthwhile pick."
1,Don't Do It!,"Bought the seemingly simple and brainless clip holder for my Treo 650 from these guys. It arrived and I was instantly aware of how cheap a rip off this item was. FLIMSY plastic, and oh yes; It didn't even come close to fitting the phone. Nice and warped... ZERO customer service too. Oh well, live and learn. (Buy the clip holder from the vendor of the phone-the $ is worth it)"
5,Outstanding Movie for your collection!,"This movie and the performances by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter are outstanding!The story and how ""Bertie"" was able to overcome his stammer and speak publicly is inspirational and since it is true even more so. This is one of the few movies I have recommended to friends and family and one we saw in the theater more than once and will now be able to screen it at home for friends who sadly missed it!"
4,Great Movie,Great movie. The rating is because profanity spews out in frustration. It is a good story made better by the fact it is based on a real life.
5,The King's Speech,"The King's Speech is one of the few films that I have seen which I could have immediately watched again. The production values are first class, the direction sensitively undertaken and the acting by all magnificent.Taking into account that certain aspects are enhanced for dramatic effect; the problems that King George VI overcame, with the loving support of Queen Elizabeth, to lead the nation and the Commonwealth, so selflessly, during the dark days of World War II, is a testimony to his innate character. History will record him as one of Britain's most loved Monarchs."
2,are you kidding me,A stuttering-stammering king who has a speech impediment? I barely made it through the first 15 mintues. Maybe I'll try again later to watch the rest when I'm desperate.
4,The Once And Future King,"No question Mr. Darcy (oops) Colin Firth deserved every accolade, including the coveted Oscar, for his performance as the stammering King George VI (the current monarch's father). Anyone from king to kid (including this writer) who has had even a passing acquaintance with stammering can relate to the story line here, and the sheer talent necessary for an actor to convincingly produce such a realistic portrayal (especially that climatic pep talk speech to the empire). And hats off to Geoffrey Rush as the unorthodox tutor who sees the king through his travails. However, at the end of the day and as the good king himself was painfully aware, good republican that I am I was left with the gnawing feeling that the monarchy (and the monarch) portrayed add nothing to our accumulated historical experience. Old Oliver Cromwell and his boys had it right in 1649-and it hasn't been right since 1660."
3,Brand new but NOT perfect.,"received this DVD in great time, was plastic sealed, new; but when played there was a slight flaw with the disc and it would stall in the same place every time. Finally just skipped that scene. Was disappointing. :("
4,"Enjoyable, sort of cliche","This is truly a good movie, a very good movie. There is little unexpected however and I hate to give it 5 stars when it is so predictable. Now sure, predictability is not bad when executed well, and this is. I have no trouble with it winning all the Oscars. But it was just not original enough, and yes it is historic but the writers could have added some ancillary plot elements and still kept the primary historical accuracy."
3,King's Speech DVD,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, but I was very disappointed. There was good acting, but the story didn't go far enough. I wanted to see more of his reign as King. Just a little more, at least. It is not the kind of DVD that I would like to see again, nor would I recommend it to my friends."
4,Be careful with this edition.,"This edition of ""The King's Speech"" was made in Canada and unfortunately leaves out most of the Special Features: The making of featurette ; Q&A with the director and the cast ; Speeches from the real King George VI and Lionel Logue highlights. This is a historical drama, rich in the history of the era, not to mention the winner of the Academy Award for Best Film, and anyone would want the additional features in order to enhance their appreciation of this amazing film. Was there any thinking involved when the decision was made to eliminate them? Adding insult to injury, this isn't even the version I ordered! It was substituted, most likely by someone routinely filling an order in a factory. Perhaps a better question would be - why have it at all? I order hundreds of DVD's for a public library collection and I rarely have any problems with the service I receive from Amazon, but I do want to warn future buyers of this film to be careful of this version."
5,Wonderful Film!,The Kings Speech is one of the finest films I've seen in a very long time. It is perfect in every. The film humanizes the Royal family.
3,the kings speech,"i saw this on vacation and thought it was a good flick..... ""mostly a girl flick"".i bought it for my mom and she thought the same"
3,Picture problem with Special Features section.,"Movie is fantastic. Special Features section has a disturbing problem on my disc: The ""Inspirational Story"" has 1/4 of the video cut-off at the top thru-out the entire segment. Anyone else have this defect on theirs?"
2,Disappointment,"After all the hype around this movie, I expected a lot more. It was little more than a story that could have been told by the History channel which would have had the same effect. I feel like I wasted those 2 hours of my life and I want them back. I wouldn't say it was a bad movie, I just think it was possibly the most over-rated movie in history."
4,George was NOT King of England,"I would just like to point out George was not King of England as there has not been one since Henry VIII or a Queen since Elizabeth Ist.He was King of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as is his daughter Elizabeth the present Queen, who strictly speaking is Queen Elizabeth Ist not 2nd as there has never been a previous Elizabeth on the British throne. Being a Scot, it's only proper to get the facts about the monarch of my country correct.Superb acting from the two male leads (Rush should have won the Oscar for best supporting) telling a fascinating true story during a turbulent period of history. Oscar worthy performances but maybe not the film as its really suited to tv or the stage. Very witty script and a real feelgood film."
1,Shame on you amazon :(,"Firstly, this is a great movie that highlights the actors credibility.. so i should mention that the 1 star isn't for the actual movie but for amazon.com performance. I ordered what is clearly listed and noted in the description. What i got in the mail was a canadian issue of the movie. If i wanted the 'Alliance' edition of this great movie, i would have logged into amazon.ca and bought it from there. Shame on you amazon.com for shipping me the canadian issue of this movie without informing me before hand.. if you did, i would have cancelled my order. Shame. :("
4,WELL WORTH A WATCH,"The intimate look at the life of stuttering prince who soon finds himself the future King of England after his older brother, Edward VIII, abdicates the throne for an American divorcee. Edward was the only monarch to abdicate the throne since the time of the Anglo-Saxons. In other words a long time ago. The quality of this picture is amped up by the quality actors, including the supporting cast. Colin Firth won the Oscar for his portrayal of Prince Albert (Bertie) who lated would become George VI, whose eldest daughter, Elizabeth, would take the throne as Elizabeth II. Nice touches on the prince's ailment and very nice interplay between Firth and Rush with a focus on the intimate life of the prince. This picture was nominated for 11 AAs and won 4, most notably Best Picture. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; EVOKING THE ERA: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of Feb. 2011."
5,Very good item.,I am very pleased with this item. It is a very interesting true story and I get it in time and in good shape.
5,What a great movie!,I was expecting a fantastic movie and I wasn't disapointed! Very well written and great performances. I would highly recommend to anyone.
5,An well-told story with superb acting,"Frankly, I did not think that a presentation of the speech difficulties that a person needs to overcome would make interesting viewing. However, the hype over this film encouraged me to see it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying the story and the acting. The film also presented some interesting drama, such as the scene where the man who is helping the king overcome his stuttering seems to be a fraud; where his wife, who did not know that he was helping the king, came into her dining room and found the queen of England sitting at her dining room table; the man using psychology to overcome or at least mitigate the stuttering problem; and the revelation that the woman that King Edward wanted to marry, Simpson, was sleeping with other men and received flowers daily from Nazi Germany. All of the acting was excellent with the possible exception of the actor playing Winston Churchill who appeared to be a caricature of this great man."
5,Great Product! and transaction!,This is a classic movie based on true historical life story of King George the 6th. Its heartwarming how a commoner full of compassion and wisdom helps change the course of an entire kingdom. The King's Speech shows how wise but poorer people are needed in the lives of the rich and famous!
5,One of my favorite movies ever!,One of my favorite movies of all times? I rate it as good as the American President and Gone with the Wind. It is a classic.
2,The Kings Speech,"Received the dvd very quickly and the packaging was fine, but I had to stop the movie three times to clean up the disc. I realize that this dvd was used, but it seems as though it should have been sent clean. The movie was terrific! Thanks"
1,Want pg 13 version,"If I can see a family-friendly version in the theater, why can't I see it in my home? Offer both versions."
1,Waiting for PG-13 Version DVD,"Great movie that I want in PG-13 version on DVD.Pull the R rated version from the movie theaters and make a PG-13 version so families can see it together,then release only R version on DVD makes no sense."
2,colin firth way too old for the role,"colin firth was far too old to play this character, with his double chin, saggy face and poorly died hair. I couldn't bear to look at him. i left wondering how much artistic license was taken with this ""docudrama"". Indeed, I think it to be a work of pure fiction based on a skeleton of trutn. The only reason this movie is receiving so much acclaim is that the mature movie goer has no choices, it's all comic book heroes and horror. Sad state of affairs."
1,Fable of usual suspects,"This was a perfectly confected wedding gift. However, one must have some sense of decency when having the stage, when having the ear or attention of a great number of people. Some sense of what one should portray as good, evil, or as 'okay'. And the more artful one is, the greater the shame when bad is portrayed as good. The British royal family was portrayed as a cuddly bunch of 'okay' folks with the impediments of wealth and, occasionally, stuttering. Subject matter matters. To do a story about a member of this group of people in any light other than dark and brooding, is disingenuous. However, power can and often does create its own mystique, and its own legend. This film, along with the upcoming wedding, is rated RG, for rational guidance suggested."
5,A WONDERFUL MOVIE,"THE ""KINGS SPEECH"" WAS A REFRESHING MOVIE!!! FUNNY, YET HEARTFELT--SO LITTLE WE KNEW ABOUT THESE SORTS OF THINGS THAT WENT ON DURING WORLD WAR TWO. SUCH SECRET DEVOTION TO A SON AS WELL AS TO A COUNTRY THAT WAS SO INVOLVED IN THE WAR. JUST EXCELLENT!!!"
5,the king's speech,"I grew up while the king was on the throne in England and remember him well. He was always a father figure, and loved by all"
3,good,"I felt this product worked just fine. the only complaint I have is that it was listed as the edited version, but the dvd that was shipped was not edited. Didn't work for a family situation."
5,Phenomenal!!,The one word to describe this film: PHENOMENAL. Every aspect of The Kings Speech was beautiful. The score perfectly sets the mood. The casting was perfect. Colin Firth was astounding! He more than deserved his Academy Award! The period costumes and architecture were striking and impressive. Firth and Rush's portrayal of an old-fashioned bromance was entertaining and touching. The build-up to the climax was suspenseful. Every shot was a work of art. Fantastic movie.
3,good historical drama,Worth a rent - colin Firth did an excellent job in the movie. I was expecting more but it was okay.
5,Delightful,"The King's Speech was a lovely film. I enjoyed it very much. I never knew before that King George VI had a speech impediment, so it was interesting to watch this story unfold. Colin Firth played King George and I thought he did an excellent job portraying a reluctant king. He also gave wonderful delivery of the stammer. Geoffrey Rush plays Lionel Logue who is King George's speech therapist. Logue is described in the film as peculiar, a title he appreciates. He has unconventional methods to rid his patients of their stammer and he is very successful in his approach. Some Oscar nominated films this year were over-hyped, but this film lives up to the expectations and hype."
3,The King's Speech,"Pretty interesting movie; not much action. Not something you watch over and over, but definately a lesson learned on what effect people do have on each other and the impact it can have on any person."
1,"Great movie, TERRIBLE Blue-ray. DO NOT BUY.",They pan and scan hacked this fine film from its intended 1:85:1 to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens. DO NOT BUY.
3,A Typical Oscar Winner,"I hate to be a downer, but I found this movie to be a typical Oscar winner meaning it was drawn out and boring. The plot, in a nutshell, is:- Man stutters- Man doesn't want to be king because kings have to speak publicly (lucky for him, he has an older brother)- Man goes to speech therapy- Older brother gives up being king- Man must now be king and speak publicly- Man overcomes stutter - YAY - The endThe acting was very good. It was nice to see Helena Bonham Carter in a role that was more subdued and she pulled it off wonderfully. Geoffrey Rush played the quirky therapist perfectly. It was just that the plot of the story was slow and boring."
3,Forgettable,"This movie was well-made and well-acted. Indeed it had everything except . . . a story. I kept getting the feeling that whoever thought to make this movie was trying to make something out of nothing---i.e., take a few historical facts and create a story around it. The friendship between Logue and the King was not developed to the point that I really cared about it, so some moments that I gather should have been climactic (e.g., when the King insults Logue and walks off), really didn't matter so much. Also, I suppose I was waiting for the PYGLMALION moment, and I just didn't see that in the King's final radio address. It was realistic in that way, I suppose, but it didn't make for those high moments that one comes to expect in a performance."
2,not pg 13 format,"I have ordered this movie twice and have talked with Amazon reps who say they will send the PG 13 version, but unfortunately they are R rated, even though it says PG 13 on their web site. Amazon has been very good about letting me send them back with free shipping, but I have had to go to UPS twice and pay for the handling of bubble envelopes, a bit of a hassle. The most frustrating thing is that Amazon still states that there is a PG 13 version available. Please fix this if only the R rated format is available."
3,Does not play on LG BD590,"""The King's Speech"" Blu-Ray will not play on the LG BD590 blu-ray player. I got two different discs then finally contacted LG customer service, who after taking a condescending attitude with me, told me they were aware of the issues with ""The King's Speech"" blu-ray disc but did not offer a time when a new firmware update would be available to fix the issue. So, if you own this player, do not buy this disc unless you want to hang onto it until LG gets a firmware update together.What happens when you put in the disc into the LG BD590 is the movie trailers will play but when it gets to the point it should either load a menu or run the movie, it justs blanks the screen."
5,Favorite Movie!,This is one of my all time favorite Movies! I love how so many of the shots look like artwork. The acting is wonderful. It's great to see a little history in movie form!
3,Ended too soon.,"I enjoyed this for the dramatized history that it is. The pacing was good, the acting was great and the story interesting. However, I felt that it ended a little too soon. I would have liked to know more about what happened over the next year or so."
3,"Interesting, but not one I'd see again.","It held my attention pretty well, but I could get distracted. I enjoyed it, but would probably not see it again."
4,Great movie,Great movie and I got the blu ray for an excellent price. It doesn't make sense to pay full price but for Black Friday prices it is great.
5,A Film Triumph!,"First, the obvious: The blu ray is technically excellent. But the real triumph is the film. Touching, poignant and upllifting, ""The Kings Speech"" is one of those contemporary films which is a true work of art and will endure as a fan favorite. This is one that you'll want to see more than one time. Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Guy Pierce, and Helena Bonham Carter are wonderful. Truly an award winning effort."
5,Loved it way more than I thought I would,"I like any movie on the British Monarch, but I liked this one even more than I thought I would. It wasn't overly done or too dramatic, but instead was a really wonderfully told story. Everyone nominated for Oscars deserved them, and you came away with an interesting look at history as well as the untold story of a brave ruler."
5,King's Speech,"the DVD was defective!the dvd was used but considered to be in very good shape! Could not get anyone to respond to my telephone call when I called the company, finally just gave up.I had seen the movie in a theatre. A wonderful movie Should be seen by all!"
1,"Might be good, if I could play the disc","Like many popular movies, the studio has larded so much new copy protection that the disc player manufacturers -- companies that still think they are hardware companies and not integrators + software developers -- have fallen behind in being able to keep up. Disk inserts into my late model player, plays some previews, but can't play the movie. I try to update the player to see if it helps, but the software on my player is incapable of completing its upgrade operation. As consumers we lack any mechanism to punish the studios for ruining our plans for the evening. Had the same experience trying to watch Avatar. Time to give up on Blu ray, I think.I hear its a good film though."
1,Innacurate movie,"I agree with the excellent reviews of Literary Architect and Cabir Marc Davis.This movie could easily have been a much better movie. As it stands it is not worthy of an academy award.Some ""historical facts"" in this movie are wrong. For example the Prime Minister did not resign when war broke out in 1939: he resigned after the defeat of Dunkirk. I think it was in April or May 1940. There are other errors.I have heard the King speak. He spoke very slowly without stuttering as would anyone else who had his speech impediment. In the movie the ""King"" spoke normally. The actor should have been trained to speak as the King actually spoke."
1,Watching grass grow,"Ugh, these Hollywood reviewers and their love for all that is slow, dull, and uneventful. I rented this film and the re-make of the ""Mechanic"" this weekend with Jason Statham, a film that the critics boo-hooed. The ""Mechanic"" was by far more entertaining. I know at this point someone reading this review might laugh me off as some testosterone fueled idiot, and I do like action movies, but I also enjoy a good entertaining drama as well. The key word there being entertaining. If you have a hard time falling asleep at night, ""The King's Speech"" might do the trick!"
1,Most over-rated movie ever,"This is one of the most boring and over-rated movies I've ever seen. I don't care that it's historically accurate. It's just not entertaining at all. Many people go through far worse things in life and I'm supposed to feel bad and enthralled by the struggles of the born with a platinum spoon in his mouth King of England and his st-st-stammering (P.S. it's a studder or speech impediment, not a stammer)?!? Please...How does this bore-fest beat out one the best movies of the past years? I write of none other than Inception. Now that movie was enthralling with a twisting plot, excellent direction, acting and action."
1,PR at its most obvious from the royal family,"This film was pushed heavily by all media. You heard the many raves and interviews.The question is why? Was it because it was a great film? If you have seen it, you know it was not. Seldom have we seen such acting talent squandered thus.Then why? Might it be because it is PR for the English royals?If you want to watch it, fine, but at least understand that you are watching pro royal propaganda."
1,The Kings Speech - Blu Ray,Unfortunately we have bee unable to view the film as it will not play through our Blu Ray system in Australia. It has been opened of course so cannot be returned. It would be appreciated if you could advise any possible action.
5,Perfect,I had fallen in love with this movie when I had first watched it. I had kept putting off actually buying it for I thought I wouldn't still love it after the fifth time watching it. I was completely wrong and I still love it now. It came extreamly fast and I was actually surprised to see it in my mailbox so soon. The whole thing was just perfect and I would buy from here again.
5,perfect from start to finish,Perfect line-up and setting. The right balance of serious and humorous. Outstanding performances. A tear or two. Never tires. Simply b-b-b-b-bbbrilliant!
4,King's speech,Love this movie. reminds us we really can do what we have to with the help of people who love us.
5,Great Performances All Around,"Excellent performances all around. The principals were all excellent and witty. The script is excellent. I especially enjoyed seeing Claire Bloom and Anthony Andrews, great actors I hadn't seen for a while."
4,Really good,I thought the movie was great and would recommend it. Bought another one for a Christmas gift for some friends
4,Greatly appreciated,"King George VI was my king as a child growing up in Australia so the information in the film was of great interest to me. The bad language was a problem, but I was ale to overlook it once I realized it was part of the ""therapy"".I thought it presented the King accurately and I gained valuable insights from watching the DVD."
5,Great movie,I've given this movie as a gift and watched it 3 times already! I just love it! Will watch it again before the week is over!
5,Great movie,"A great movie and very inspirational. I had seen it in the theaters, saw it again via Netflix, and then because it's such a good movie, decided to buy it for my movie collection."
5,Great movie making,"When you take a simple premise of;-a person has a stuttering problem;- they need a counselor to help them overcome this because publicspeaking will be an important aspect of this person's job and- the movie culminates with simply a ""big speech""That hardly sounds like a cinematic situation yet ""The King's Speech"" makes this premise absolutely enthralling. By the time the movie ends, with the giving of that ""King's Speech"", you, the viewer, will feel very satisfied.This movie is exceptional because of the acting and chemistry between Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth, the incredible direction and exsquisite attention to period details.The movie probably will be better on DVD since this movie deserves repeated viewings."
4,Long Live The King,"We watched this last night. My roommate is a Brit and she was quick to point out the varying historical inaccuracies which rather ""got on my wick"" as she might say. I didn't care. Great story. So 4 stars for it and only 1 for my roommate. And 5 for the gorgeous chameleon of an actor, Guy Pearce as the Bertie's shallow older brother David who abdicates. Cheerio."
5,Great!,I recently watched this movie in preparation for the just released Les Miserables (which Tom Hopper directed) and I enjoyed it very much!
3,"Pleasant, but not great","I looked forward to seeing this movie, considering the reviews and awards it received. When it reached our little town, I went to see it. It's a very pleasant movie, but hardly great. I really can't see why it won so many awards. I like all the actors, good story but a little thin.Good representation of just how awful the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were, however.Nice to see Helena Bonham-Carter with her hair combed."
3,Why not use the headphones?,"Early in this movie, on his first visit to the speech therapist, Prince Albert is fitted with headphones - when really loud music is played (so that he can't hear himself talk) - Prince Albert can read from a book without stuttering. So why didn't they just put the headphones on him when he has to read the speech at the end? It was a speech on the radio - no one would ever know!"
5,Emotional and Courageous,"An emotional story of the courage and determination of the Duke of York, second son of King George V, stammering through a 1925 speech. His wife convinces him to see Lionel Logue, a self-taught Australian speech therapist living in London.Their relationship began with a rocky start, foundering over royal protocol and the Duke's lack of self-confidence. Logue prescribed vocal exercises and tongue-twister, and gave the Duke confidence to relax, avoiding tension-induced muscle spasms in his diaphragm. The Duke became king after his father died and brother David abdicated to marry Mrs. Wallis Simpson. Logue guided the new King George VI's speeches during WWII, and was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in recognition of his personal service to the Monarch. The two became friends and remained so for the rest of their lives."
5,Very enjoyable,"A lovely film, involving King George VI of England, and his struggles to overcome his speech impediment. You see the king go through his struggles, the swirl of controversy over his older brother who abdicated the throne, a glimpse into the somewhat lonely life he lead, and the fears, anger and triumphs he faces as he meets an unlikely friend/tutor that helps him overcome his difficulties to help lead England through very terrible times.The cast is strong, the cinematography is excellent. Overall a lovely movie and one worth watching.Well done."
4,good movie,"This is actually a gift, but I saw the movie in the theatre when it came out. I throughly enjoyed the story line and the acting was very good indeed. While my husband enjoyed the movies as well, he thought The Fighter was a better movie, while I liked this one better.It took a very long time to receive this item. It was in Springfield, MA on Oct. 6 or 7th, and I received in RI on Oct. 17, even though Springfield, MA is about a 2 hour drive from where I live. I am not sure why it took 10 or 11 days for it to get here from Springfield, but I did eventually receive it.Would highly recommend the movie."
5,Fit for a king,"Excellent movie coupling history, humor and drama. Gives a new insight to life of the ""royals"". Well worth the watch!"
5,Great Movie!,Great movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I plan to watch it again. The acting is excellent and realistic.
3,The King's Speech review,Good movie but boring to watch on a long flight. It put me to sleep. I think I would have enjoyued it more if I were on a short flight.
5,Just wonderful,"I loved the movie in the theatre, and love it even more with the special extras on a dvd. Great acting, wonderful spoken English, and a great portrait of Edward and Wallace - gives one a good idea of why he was not fit to be king. The whole thing was a delight."
5,Flawless in Every Way,"The King's Speech is one of those rare movies that lives up to its hype. It's perfectly cast. You can't imagine anyone else in any of the roles. To mention one would mean having to mention them all lest someone be slighted. They were all superb. The storytelling was emotional, imaginative, effective, as well as lovely to look at. The pacing was good. The settings were as much alive as the characters. The characters were so well written that you felt like you knew them all. Movies just don't tend to come together as well as this one does. It really is well done. It's a movie that I will watch over and over again."
5,King's Speech,"The movie is excellent as we already knew. The order was processed quickly and we received it as indicated ""as the video was released""."
1,The King's Speech,I will not be reviewing this item as it won't play on my DVD Blu Ray player. I have other Blu Rays from you which do play so there must be something wrong with this disc.I won't be ordering any more films from you.
1,No DVD? Off to Barnes & Noble.,"I came to Amazon to buy a DVD of the King's Speech, but they only have it in Blu-Ray. They don't even link to used DVDs of it. So I'm off to Barnes and Noble's to buy it there: [...]"
1,lew,Have never received my purchase. Have never received a response to questions. Does this company exist????????? Amazon needs to drop the sponsorship of this entity!!!!! Sue hope they do not try to charge me for this item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed with Bluray quality,The movie itself was simplistic in its story. Acting was good all round. Still definitely not worth more than one Oscar at the most. Think about this: the number of characters were a handful. Nothing big on costumes. No special effects at all. Shots could have been done with a good handycam. Wonder why the Oscars? Regarding the product itself: the bluray quality was awful. Don't waste money on the bluray. Probably the regular DVD may have a better resolution. Worst bluray resolution I have ever seen.
1,A Less Than Royal Treatment,"Where is the much-ballyhooed PG cut of the film?? With all the studios forcing digital copies on the consumer to jack up prices, you'd think the ""family-friendly"" version could have been included..."
1,Speech therapy! Whoop-de-doo!,Guy with a stammer gets help from a speech therapist.And?And it's THE KING!Whoop-de-doo.
3,Closed Captions needed,Closed captions would really help for those of us a little hard of hearing. Otherwise it was great. It can definiitly be promoted as a historical picture.
2,released music only,"This might be a pleasing read-along for the casual collector. Rogan provides short blurbs for each song, including a little background information on each, and quotes from (unsourced) interviews. Many Neil Young fans could write this book in a weekend alone with a stereo and a pot of coffee.As a ""Guide"" though, this book is not ""Complete"". Neil Young has a few unreleased albums (like ""Chrome Dreams"", which went as far as an acetate) and unrecorded tunes (like ""No One Seems To Know""). Rogan's book doesn't cover these. Heavyweight collectors will also be dissatisfied with lack of information on various releases. Not to mention, if I may be so gauche, bootlegs.And realisticly you can buy a dozen record guides (and read dozens more online) that include writeups of Young's available albums."
3,Rogan tries but....,"As an avid reader of anything about Neil Young, I would rate this near the top of the heap, but that is relatively faint praise. Rogan writes and is edited better than Einarson (The Canadian Years) and David Downing (Dreamer of Pictures)and is less pretentious than Paul Williams (Love To Burn) but in the end,I probably enjoyed those books more. However, because I read those books first that may be partly due to the fact that necessarily this book covers the same ground.Unfortunately, no one has yet written the definitive book on Neil so we have to make do with what is out there."
5,"Great price, much better than Geforce","I upgraded from an ATI Radeon 7000 64MB to this one. I must say that the graphics processor does a very nice job. Everything in my layouts, digital photography, and games, seem to come alive. The only drawback that I can find with this card is that it doesn't overclock very well. ATI and Sapphire Technologies are the best AGP manufacturers out there. Forget the nVidia nForce. Ive had one of those also, and can truly say that the graphics are not as good as this card. I recommend this card to anyone that does not intend to overclock or play serious games that call for overclocking. And last, but not least, buy it@amazon for the best price and service.Ps also they have here with 256 Mb edition for $30 more"
1,?¿?¿?¿?¿,"Well, ok my dad bought this movie for 5 bucks at wal-mart because he thought it looked good. Well.......it is a pretty poorly animated film (being that it was released in almost 2003),but god did it make me and my sister laugh!!!!!!!!!! yes it is REALLY corny, but if you like corny, movies, then this is an ok movie."
1,Save Your Money,"Badly written, badly acted, and not worth the time if you're over the age of 8. Even 8 year olds will find this to be cheesy. Looks as if they filmed it at an out of season Renaissance Fair site. Costumes and special effects and make up try to make up for the lack of plot, writing, acting, and character development, but there are better movies out there for kids to see. Don't buy this."
1,Poor Home Video,"This movie is sure to be among the world's worst children's films ever. As a children's theater director, I never would have cast this sorry group of performers who looked the part but were outclassed by the scenery in terms of their delivery of lines. (Except for the title character, Max who seemed to try.)I watched this turkey in growing disbelief that it could get any worse....but it did! The videography was straight out of home movie production with a large reliance on diagonal wipes in scene changes, and about one overused special effect that was used for everything ""magical."" The plot was almost non-existent and combined with the actor's sterling delivery managed to bore everyone present at my god-daughters birthday party.Bottom line -- the six year old lost interest after ten minutes and the nine year old lasted a half hour (but it was her present from Grandma so she made the effort).Save your money. Buy any older children's classic from Disney instead."
4,max and the legends of the rings,It is a great movie especially for the price. The movie is great especially for kids who love science fiction
3,"Cheesey, Hammy, Hilariously Bad","When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite movies ever. I could go straight from watching Labyrinth to this. I just recently got to watch it again, and I can say: Childhood was jaded, but this was hilariously bad. If you want a good laugh, get it. It's cheap (a little under $5 at the time of this review) and will deliver a good laugh."
4,sand man's review,"This novel was a good,enjoyable,and scary book to read. The bookstarts off kind of confusing untill you get to the first chapter.The main character in this book is Carl Timmons,a senior ina small town in californa. The book goes on to tells about the dreams he has about his friend that is dead. The trobeled senior has no idea what taking him and his commpany on this hunt will do.If you want to find out try reading the book. I enjoyed this book ,and look forward to reading more of Chistopher Pike's novels."
2,Dull and wierd,"This book was hardly horrifying for a horror book and when I read it at night I wasn't the least bit scared. The ending was idiotic, but surprising. It was totally unrealistic. I would recommend Chain Letter as one of Pike's better books."
3,Decent Pike,"I'm a huge Pike fan so of course I read this book. It's classic Pike with horror, thrills, and twists, but it definitely isn't my favorite. A group of kids go on a scavenger hunt at the end of the school year only it turns out they aren't following the same list of clues as the rest of the class. They are following their own set of clues that leads them right into danger. Most of Pike's stuff, though unreal, is written in a way that is totally believable and this one fell a bit short of that. I still love Pike but I think he rushed through this one."
3,Not bad and not good,Scavenger Hunt was okay. It is a story in where there are two groups that are thrown into a deadly game. The book revealed some good secrets that were mentioned in the book but the plot is unrealistic.
2,DOWNRIGHT WEIRD!!!!,At first i thought i like this book but not the end..it's totally weird and not the best i've ever read from MR PIKE!!!!
4,Good but long,"Scavenger hunt is about a boy who lost his best friend, ending up doing a scavenger hunt with his new friend,a girl named Cessy, and her brother. After clue number two, he only see's the team of his friend Tracie. It turns out his new friend is his best friend brought back to life, and Cessy and her brother are super smart dinasour things. They kill people to look human and stay alive."
2,not the best,"very little instruction on strumming styles, patterns, or tricks, no audio files and the songs included are exclusively hokey old bible-camp songs from the turn of the century that nobody wants to play (home on the range, buffalo gals, you're a grand old flag, etc.)"
4,Great item and great price,This is perfect for carrying your current project with space to hold your tools also. Much more affordable than similar products.
2,Case does not lock well and pops open often,"I was very disappointed in this item, considering what I paid for this.It is made of heavy-duty plastic, but the lid does not securely fit the case and the latch does not work at all.The case pops open all the time.I have decided to just use this for newspaper clippings I intend to file at a later time.I would never use this case for valuable items like family photographs or small scrapbooking supplies like stickers or trimmings, that would fall all over the floor when the case opens up on its own.The manufacturer needs to do better quality assurance on this item"
3,Watch your fingers!,"I purchased these as part of two six-drawer scrapbook storage rolling things at Joann Fabrics. 35.99 on sale. Anyway, it is very easy to pinch your fingers when closing these. The tops have a double edge which makes the seal nice and tight so your little pieces won't get lost, but it can be tricky to line them up and close them."
2,Mr Coffee 12 Cup Pause and Pour Coffeemaker,"After buying three, yes three, different types of Mr. Coffee coffeemakers, I have come to the conclusion that you are better off buying a cheaper brand and saving yourself some money and the aggravation. The pause and pour feature is fine - if you can pour in less than five seconds - if not it drips hot coffee on your hand as you replace the pot. The worst feature, consistently, is the burner. All three have given me problems from not keeping the coffee warm enough to being so hot the coffee gets a strong bitter taste. Take my advice and skip this as your purchase choice."
1,This coffee maker is driving me nuts!,"Have had this Mr. Coffee for about a year now and I can't wait to get rid of it. I've always been satisfied with this brand in the past, but no more! There is some defect in the pot design that causes drips and dribbles from every pour, have to hold the pot over the sink to minimize the mess every morning. And the too-bright blue LED lights are harsh on the eyes in the early morning dark kitchen. I keep a paper towel over those lights. This thing has to go, am real sorry I bought it and wish it would break so I don't feel like I'm wasting money in getting a new one. Keep shopping unless these issues are not a problem for you."
1,Two makers when bad.,"I had two of these makers and both went bad. The first one I used every day for a couple of years. You know how these makers gurgle at the end of the brew cycle as they suck the last of the water out of the reservoir? Well, one morning it just wouldn't stop gurgling, and when I investigated, the back of the unit was getting real hot. So I ended up tossing it away. I had another maker in the house for guest to use (I drink decaf). So I was going to use it, but it seemed that the programable clock/delay chip must have crashed because the maker would turn itself off and on as I watched the lights, and it would not turn on at the delay time. So I tossed it too and bought a different brand.I also experienced the dripping lid problem that other reviewers have commented on, as well as the filter that would cave in and let grounds into the carafe."
1,Mr Coffee,"I have been buying Mr Coffee coffee makers for years and loved them until I purchased this design.This redesign is awful.First,the coffee keeps dripping when you remove the pot; not just as brewing,but always.The new design is strange in that the lid that opens in order to pour water in the reservoir is the entire top,therefore, so large you cannot fully open it if you have upper cabinets. You have to pull the entire pot to the edge of the counter to open the lid.Very poor design.I disliked it so much I threw it away after 3 months."
1,dripping pot,"I returned my Mr. Coffee after 2 days because I couldn't pour a cup of coffee from this pot design without it srteaming down the front of the pot and all over everything. I was pretty sure it wasn't just me since I have no problem with my old Bunn pot, but still felt better when I saw another reviewer with the same complaint. Like that reviewer, I can't believe Mr Coffee doesn't know it is a flawed design and already have corrected it."
5,A Great Interpretation of Gilbert and Sullivan!,"The Stratford Festival productions are perfect for your collection, as long as you are not a ""purist"" of G&S. Pooh in Mikado was very well done, even though some fans of G&S have said it was over done. :-) My suggestion is to buy this set as a supplement to an existing collection of G&S videos. I suggest you buy a set that is more strict on their interpretation of G&S before buying this set. But, it really is a good set."
5,sheer joy,"Over thirty years ago I saw the D'Oyly Carte company perform ""The Mikado"" in London. Sadly, the production was old and tired and lifeless and more suited to a dusty old museum attic than the stage. The D'Oyly Carte company died soon thereafter.A few years later I saw the Stratford Festival productions of ""The Mikado"" and ""Pirates"" recorded here. They were wonderful, and had me on my feet for well-deserved standing ovations. Yes, they took liberties with the material; they made the operettas living theatrical entertainment full of joy and laughter. Unless you think comic operettas are sacred texts, you will enjoy the fun-filled spirit of these performances."
2,Good service. Questionable product quality.,The Vendor got this to me very expeditiously. The discs do NOT operate properly. You have to start the DVD using the scene selection not by selecting play DVD. This means you CAN'T use the scene selection feature the way that it should be used.
1,The Mikado,"Most disappointing. I have seen high school productions, and none as bad as this. Mikado should NEVER be ""modernized"" - American Express has no place in any production of it. It was all just too, too precious for words. Terrible, terrible, terrible."
1,Interesting title with lack of content,"Like the other reviewer, I was also taken in by the promise suggested on the cover, but I was shocked by how little the book tells us to ""think in the future tense."" Many of the examples that she gave about modern technology are false and naive at best. It makes one question where the author has been for the last 20 years. The section titles did offer some interesting guidelines for how to think differently, but the content was just horriblely wrong and bland. The best way to approach the book is to read the section titles only and skip the rest of it."
5,Bought it for nephew but kept it (for now) for myself!,"I originally got this book with my nephew in mind, but I started to read it and then decided he could wait. I know a fair amount about the Revolution, but there were stories in the book I hadn't encountered before. Sheinkin neatly juggles micro and macro perspectives, human interest anecdotes and the sweep of historical events. He uses the telling phrase to fix a character in our minds. The book has a strong narrative drive-scenes often start in the middle of the action-a fun but not flippant tone, and a wealth of well-chosen but accessible primary source quotes. The combination should be irresistible for kids. It was for me."
5,A real page turner!,"This book is perfect for getting kids excited about history. And it's great for adults, too. Sheinkin writes in a conversational style that that pulls you in to the story. I learned a lot of things that I didn't know about the Revolutionary War---like that the British thought Ben Franklin was working on a secret electrical machine that would destroy Britain! The illustrations really add to the charm of the book as well. The picture of John Adams in pajamas---loved it!"
1,it sucks!,"ok this book was the worst book i have ever read. grammer is messed up. and please dont write about ur sexual life in their. YOUR MESSED UP! THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY FALSE. I AM ONE OF THE CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THIS BOOK AND I CAN SAY ON MY BEHALF IT IS FALSE BECAUSE KAREN AND MARCIA WERE GREAT MOTHERS.THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE FOR ALL OF US. I RECOMEND NOT BUYING THIS BOOK BECAUSE ITS ALL LIES. THANK YOU,"
5,Too short by far.,"I started sports car racing about the same time as Janet, also had no money, and enjoyed all the years of scratching and clawing for a ride. I could not have written this book, though, because not only did she do something special, she tells the stories so well. I learned more about her in the book than I did at the time, and as a result of the book, feel the shared history and experiences deeply.As a mutual friend said, ""...it's exposed more about her and what she did and how she did it than most (of her comtemporary racing friends) either knew or understood...it's established more of a camaraderie with other racers ..."" than was thought to exist at the time.I wish she would publish the other several hundred pages she had to cut out of this beek, as I am sure I would enjoy it also."
5,extra-ordinary,"Comprehensive, plausible, interesting, classic...... makes you experieced classic neurologist, without it, you will not understand the word : ""Neurology"""
1,Cosmic Telepathy writen by Lobsang Rampa?,Im not impressed about this idea of The Author. Lobsang Rampa Died in 1981! He said in one of his books that there would be people trying to pretend to be him and to be in touch with him.Were did this come from?Certainly not Lobsang Rampa!!! I would like to return this book I have on my Kindle.It don't belong in my library.
1,Cosmic Telepahty,"Actually very disappointed in this book, read it several times trying to warm up to it, but unable to.Unable to connect with this book."
5,Great addition to our Dollhouse!,This was a great item to add to our dollhouse since we didn't have any babies or baby furniture yet. Each piece is very durable and nicely made........my granddaughters LOVE playing with it each time they visit. I wholeheartedly recommend this addition for your dollhouse!
1,What was Stine thinking?,"First of all he seems to hate Splatter Movies of the eighties. Every second film is worthless in his opinion. Of course some of this films are cheap and senseless but Mr. Stine seems to lack any kind of objectivity. He was nastier than most of the films effects putting everything down, especially Rock and Metalmusic of the eighties. And that really made me mad because i love this music. He even went so low writing"" ....is killing 25 people, well not really people but Rockers""!!! What the hell....this is a discrimination against people who love this kind of music. Scott Aaron SWine sucks!"
5,This mouse was built to work its tail off for You!,"i tried microsoft, logitech and some no name brand wireless mouse and the conclusion: this mouse is awesome! the range is great (despite what ONE person said), battery life is great due to energy saving auto power off mode, RECHARGABLE, slightly small for comfort, did i mention RECHARGABLE? anyway, this mouse sells for almost $50 but i bought it for way less on e-bay without any problems. give this mouse a try and you'll know what we're talking about"
2,Didnt work for me,"This unit just didnt communicate well. The USB port is on the back on my laptop, but the mouse would have to be within about 10-12 inches from the receiver to work."
2,The range is horrible,"The range on this mouse is horrible, not much further then a foot away until it becomes slightly unresponsive, 1.5 feet away and you get no signal. Forget around a corner, this mouse seems to need line of sight (why, if it is RF?) The USB port is in the back of my laptop and it doesnt work unlessi use the extension cable to put the reciever on the side of my laptop."
1,Stay Away from it,"Horrible. Felt like going back to the guy who told me it was good to kick his b..t Anyhow, rarely seen such poor construction. As said some one else, good concept.....don't have to carry the base arround, can swap between rechargable and non-rechargable batteries...small mouse, small receiver...but hell, nothing works...NOTHING. A lot of reviews accuse the mouse of obviously OS-related problems...(typical USB stories), but no one seems to mention the most important of all: THIS MOUSE LIKES NO SURFACE AT ALL...NONE! Even an optical mouse pad....I can't beleive this. On top of all the rest of the crap, I had to fix the battery cover, it's really hard to sync up with its receiver, and the cursor is all over the place.....Fortunatly, it is solid enough to withstand the many times I chucked it at the wall. I'm still waiting for a decent portable wireless mouse to apear on the market.....has not happened yet....the logitech model seem as crappy as this one....Good Luck."
4,"Good, but not the best of the series.","I am completely delighted with ""The Little Guides"" series. The format is extremely user friendly, and each guide is packed with useful and interesting information. I enjoy reading them, but my 6 year old daughter gives them the most use. While the guides are written at an adult level, there is plenty that she can read and understand. I currently own ""Sharks,"" ""Birds,"" ""Mammals,"" ""Space,"" ""Whales,"" and ""Flowers.""""Flowers"" has five parts: 1) Learning about your landscape, 2) Flowering annuals and biennials, 3) Flowering bulbs, 4) Flowering perennials, and 5) Flowering trees, shrubs, and vines. While there is plenty that younger children can learn from this guide, it is definitely targeted towards a more mature audience. In general, this is more of a ""how to"" guide than the others. There is also less in the way of photographs and illustrations than in the other guides.It is still a good general guide to flowers, but comparatively not the best volume in the series."
3,A narated historical biography,"The famous award winning small town Midwest newspaperpublisher and author loses his daughter in a riding accidentwhen she hits her head on a tree while riding her horseafter waving at a boy who was sweet on her.The whole piece seems to be about how difficult and idealisticthis teen age girl was who was just about to graduate from high school.She breaks her arm cranking her model T Fordand that sets off a chain of parental disciplines.For the most part with excellent grades and very goodbehavior, she is a model daughter who is head strongand at her Dad's teaching, very idealistic aboutdiscrimination, the elderly, unions and human rights ingeneral. The time period is the active one of post world warone when horses still were used on a great many roads and farms in the Midwest.I liked the movie, but it was kind of sentimental."
1,A waste of money,This product is made in Germany but with the quality you'd expect of any Chinese made item. The box shows a picture of a tomato and a pear. They have to be kidding! This thing couldn't cut butter. Spend some extra dollars on something else and you won't be disappointed.
1,Deceptive,The size showen in the picture is deceptive. It is not big enough for anything execpt carrots and radishes. Disappointed to say the least!
3,Mastering required,"Look, the performance is first rate, however the sound quality leaves much to be desired. This recording is in desperate need of remastering. DG does it, and so can this label. It's like the orchestra is hidden somewhere there and screaming to get out! Thus the three stars."
2,A ponderous 'Emperor' and pretty good overtures,"With due respect to Mr. Morrison, I got no sense of occasion from this draggy, loggy Emperor from 1974. toward the end, Gilels took seriousness too far and lapsed into ponderousness. considering that he had a world-class technique, I was astonished that he could take the finale so slowly and make such heavy weather of it. There isn't much outstanding about Wand's quite conventional conducting, and the sound quality is no better than good FM stereo. I feel like I'm putting nails into coffins, but the cologne Radio Orch. is nobody's idea of a great ensemble, although it's a good one.The CD ends with a very forceful, well-conceive Coriolan Over. that held my attention and a conventional 'Fidelio' Over. that lacked a bit in dramatic suspense and featurees a feeble horn section. In all, this was a disappointing disc given the high praise being accorded to it."
1,Not Happy,"This book was under the ""teacher addition"" title and when it arrived at my home it was the ""student""version. Felt very misled and disappointed. Poor advertising of this product."
3,Good product,"This is the best price I found on this filter. To me, a filter is a filter as far as the hot tub goes, so I can't say it's great or terrible."
3,The film is ok but misses some points from the book,"The film is ok, but like many childern film adaptations, misses some key points in the book and just doesn't give me the same feel as the book does. For example, the Phantom actually does run in the official race before Paul and Maureen release her back to the wild. So, I was a bit dissapointed in the film. As to the horses not having the EXACT same markings as the ones in the book as another reviewer complained... That I can overlook as the horses they used were close enough and to match horse markings, especially pinto colors that's close to impossible."
4,Pretty good,"I never rate a DVD with 5 stars if it has no extras, and this one doesn't. The story line is obviously the same as I remembered it from the VHS, but the quality is no better. I could have produced similar on myDVR at home."
3,Misty,I don't know why it wasn't as good as I expected. I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with the horses. Something was missing and I can't put my finger on it. Just a feeling.
3,its good expect the end,i watched this whan i was 7 it was nice at the begenning but it went down to the hill
2,Disappointing,"I read the book to my two children, age 11 yo son and 5 yo daughter. My son was excited to get the movie. However, when we watched it, my son was disappointed. He noted the drastic change in story line, the poor quality of the lighting/screen colors, and the poor acting. My son is an actor himself, but had never made such comments before and this was the first movie he had ever walked out on. On the other hand, my daughter loved it. I did not like the change in the storyline making the grandparents seem much stricter."
4,misty,"My husband and I enjoyed the movie very much. Great story about a brother and sister who want a horse on Chincoteaque. The movie is dated in the 1960s. My husband and I watched the pony swim for the first time in Chincoteaque [amazing to see].It was nice to see some things didnt change on the Island. I would definately order from amazon again, recieved movie in 2 days and very reasonably priced."
5,GREAT family story!,I read the book as a child and dreamed of living life like the Beebe children. I used the DVD to introduce my children to the story of Misty and the wild ponies of Assateague before our visit to the coast of Virginia. This is a great family story based on real people in a beautiful area of our great country.
3,Misty,"Misty was a sweet gentle kids film, my kids really enjoyed it. It was an older film but nice and gentle, not too exciting for younger viewers"
4,MISTY,"What a Lovely Film, we rented this for Christmas for my 11 year old daughter and we all enjoyed the movie. Very good filming and a very cute movie."
2,Poor shipping...,"I got this shipped to me in a box about 5 feet long. The problem is that this rod is about 1.5 feet smaller than that in its ""un-tellescoped"" state. Since there was no packing material included, the rod was free to crash around inside the box during shipping. As a result, my rod came to me with the base cap broken in three pieces. I'll be going to Home Depot to try to find something similar to keep the rod sections from falling out the bottom. For the price, not bad...just dissappointing."
5,"Smart, Sly, with Moxie!","About upper middle class English people, and set in England, eastern Europe, and various sites in the Empire. A very entertaining, ironic, subtly written set of very short to medium length stories deflating snobs and those showing other pretensions. Not so silly or as off-putting as the cover photo of the artist as a young man. Really very carefully crafted writing, and still funny a hundred years later. A smart-aleck with moxie is the normative character. Brilliant!"
5,"Wonderful, witty stories","These short stories are all wonderful, perfect little bites of literature, full of humour and colour and more than occasionally with a little twist.The stories are also perfect little portraits of the times - Monroe makes comment on the people, the fashions and whatever was in vogue. And he does it very, very well.My favourite is ""The Open Window"", which is deliciously funny, but they are all marvellous."
5,Purchasing complete works after reading just a few stories,"Just finished reading a 30-year old Dell paperback of Mr. Munro's stories, and I want more! Wit, irony, sarcasm: just think that his stories are plus or minus 100 years old, and he still is funny, horrifying, stunning, and right on the mark! After reading the Dell paperback, and writing this little review, I'm going back to the Amazon shopping cart and purchasing the complete works. In paperback, unfortunately. Ah, such is life...."
4,The short stories are top drawer.,"This is a great book for the loo. Endings are often surprising but often in a similar way. Thus, although the stories are short and exceptionally well written, they are best in small doses. I managed to get through one of the novels (alternative history), but it was preachy. Found nothing beyond the stories of much interest."
5,"Perfectly Written, Mordantly Witty, Astonishing","No one writes as Saki did. The only writers even vaguely similar are Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and such columnists as Russell Baker and Maureen Dowd. He is a true genius in compression, wild imagination, wicked humor. In virtually each line, there is a twist, an extraordinary turn of phrase. I imagine the Clovis and Reginald stories being read by John Gielgud or Rex Harrison in high dudgeon. His stories with surprise endings are simply better and more sophisticated than O. Henry. He is a true master of the extreme short story genre that he seems to have created (far superior to say, Bruce Jay Friedman whose work I do like). I haven't read A.J. Liebling or S.J. Perelman, but cannot imagine the exquisite touch of Saki. They are a true joy - each little story a gem of 3-7 pages. Have fun."
2,black and white!,I was disappointed that 90% of the examples by Whitney were in BLACK and WHITE. It would have been far more helpful had the pictures been in color.
1,Watercolor with no color,"Complete Guide to Watercolor PaintingMost illustrations are in black and white, more than 50% indeed. That's not what a watercolor book should be."
1,colorless illustrations,"How can a book that claims to be a ""complete guide"" to watercolor painting be produced without color??? It boggles the mind. All the illustrations are in black and white, reproduced as if by a xerox machine, with muddled detail to boot. Unbelievable!"
3,Good but dated,"Complete Guide to Watercolor PaintingWhitney is considered a dean of American watercolor. His book as text is an excellent discussion of the rules of watercolor painting, and he offer many exercises to lead the student thru the principles of design. The book seems somewhat dated due to the presence of a lot of black and white drawings, but his detailed discussions override this one flaw."
5,The Master of Watercolor!,"Mr. Whitney is the launching pad upon which the sincere watercolorist will be able to soar. His emphasis on design and the use of the abstract method to produce the desired effect of individualism is unparalled. This book is extremely thorough and very well thought out. No pages with unusable knowledge, Whitney gives thorough explanations of how to view your personal approach to painting once cemented in the fundamentals of design and value. It is one of my favorite books in watercolor; it has a college text approach."
3,Not well thought out.,This book constantly referenced paintings that were on the page or the next page. Reference frequently had to do with color. Guess what the pictures were about 50% B&W.; I asked if I had a misprint and was told that I didn't that the cost of printing all in color was prohibitive. Duhhh...Some good tecniques but it had the above issue.
2,so-so,"I know I am not a traditional watercolor painter but I thought I could learn something from this book - given the glowing reviews I had read. Well.... right off the bat, the paintings Whitney uses for his examples, are horrible! its really hard to learn from a painting teacher when you don't like their paintings. He writes pretty well and poetically and seems to really love watercolor. Its just you do not see him putting his words into practice with his work and that makes it really hard to get into what the guy is saying."
5,The basics of producing fine watercolors,"Edgar Whitney's Complete Guide To Watercolor Painting comes from a watercolor painter/teacher who provides beginners with the basics of producing fine watercolors, from landscapes to portraits. Black and white and a few color illustrations round out his advice in this reprint."
5,Unsung Heroes,A great book on what really happened in WWII. These women lost lives and loves as they fought the Axis and supported our forces. It is well written and chock full of facts.
1,"Good Movie, Bad Presentation","The color is faded and scratchiness from beginning to end. Audio also fades at times. This is only a copy of a vhs print. A disappointment.Unusual story, exotic location, and excellent cast(William Sylvester,Diane Clare, Edward Underdown)highlighted by the beautiful Aliza Gur(Miss Israel 1960). Important elements of BOM's plot were ""borrowed"" by the movies Nightmare(1973) and Jacob's Ladder(1989). Sooner than later this movie will get a decent release."
4,Beast Of The Hand Of Night,A tourist travelling through the desert comes at night upon a lavish Moorish castle wherein he is entertained by a mysterious wealthy woman. He departs and returns in the morning to find the place has vanished. His inquiries only bring fear and hostility from the local villagers. He gradually finds himself lured into a deadly and sinister mystery.
1,Good concept - poor product,"I wanted to expose my daughter to Spanish and bought this book & tape and was so disappointed by the use of both Spanish and English in the same song and use of what I consider ""Spanglish"". I also found some of the English songs not to be true translations and some of the songs were just plain poor grammar, like the song about how delicious tamales are. I would NOT recommend this to anyone who wants to teach children Spanish correctly."
5,A loveable rogue!,"I never read biographies of singers and rock people...just not interested. I picked up this book in my boyfriend's office and just could not put it down! I laughed , I cried and, more than anything else, I missed him terribly once the book ended. His biography is so honest and real, warts and all, that you cannot help liking the guy and feeling as if he's your best friend by the time you get to the last page. I also found fascinating the accounts of the London scene... so many places and people he mentions I have actually met in person. So I was totally absorbed."
5,Take It Like A Man Is A Fascinating Read!,"While this book has over 400 pages, it didn't take me long to read it. In fact i had a hard time putting it down. Boy George who has charmed us with his music ever since the early eighties, tells his story with such candor and the witt that he is famous for. I think after all these years and all that he has been through, he still hasn't lost his sense of humor. Between talking about his long time heroin addiction to his romance with drummer Jon Moss, George shows us in Take It Like A Man that he is more than just a pop superstar, but a human being with a heart and soul. George if you ever happen upon these pages, just remember that we love you and wish you the best always."
5,"Tell it, sister!","If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. Boy George's book is fascinating, funny, tragic and so brutally honest. From Drags to Riches, Boy goes from being a queer youth to pop star and then descends the depths of drug addiction and tragedy only to reemerge more fabulous than ever. Not many books are filled with such candor and humor. I have read and reread this book and always find myself breathless to turn to the next page. A definite addition to anyone's library!"
5,Very Honest&a trip,no matter what you think of Boy George He is one of the Very Few People in the Industry that is Honest&Frank.He is full of many Emotions&reflections.I dig the early Culture Club Records.He is a Person with alot of Personality.He has overcome alot.like the song He did back in 1988 with Teddy Riley this Book will take your mind on a trip.
2,maybe my expectations were too high,I was more interested in the first half of the book...reading about how nromal life was when George wasen't so famous. I'm not interested in reading about the life and times of Culture Club and drug addictions and what-not...leave that to the tabloids!
4,Survivor Boy George tells it straight from the hip,"A fascinatng story of one man's fate at the fickle finger of fame - only to come up smelling of roses! Very hard to put down once picked up, the story takes you on the crazy roller-coaster ride of the music business. Essential reading for any wannabe popette. A bit too graphic in the parts concerning George discovering, and indulging in, homosexual love. Boy George is shown as living a life the majority only dream of. Definately worth reading!"
4,Thought Queen Elizabeth's life was tough?,"Culture Club seemed to be the theater company that everyonewanted to join. Think back to the 80's when songs of loveand heartache got us through the day. It didn't seem towork for Boy George and the crew. Dark, abusive lovebetween George and his lover, the drummer(Jon Moss),almostdestroyed our favorite ""drag queen"". The pop idol livedthrough it all, though, and tells the story in a diary tone.If you think fame is nothing but ""caviar and roses"", thisbook will show you that there is a human side to everyone."
4,I really enjoyed this book,"This is a sensitive and introspective account of a woman coming to terms with her husband's death and her own independance. It's a shame that we don't hear Marshall's name as often as we do Walker's, Morrison's. We hear more about Terry McMillan's vapid and superficial writing than we do about a really talented writer like Marshall!"
2,Disappointing,"This book was surprisingly boring. Paule Marshall's one of my favorite writers, but this book didn't do it for me. The pace was too slow and too many pieces didn't tie together. The story just felt fragmented and the narrative wasn't compelling. A shame too..."
3,Soggy in the middle,"I had heard such great things about this book and was eager to read it. The story flowed well in the beginning and the author's use of language was exquisite. However, the story seemed to sag in the middle with confusing flip-flopping between Avey's past and the present situations that she found herself in. It was a little hard to tie these elements together; I still don't know what the significance of the old man was. This was a book club selection so it will be interesting to see what the others in my group think about it."
5,I only wish I'd have known this before!,"Wow, what a terrific book. The truth about ""healthcare"" being really ""sickcare"" was so eyeopening! Our family has experienced so many medical mistakes, well...no more. We have found a Chiropractor in our area and will only use MD's for emergency situations. Thank you to these warriors for no longer sitting back and being quiet! Everyone should know the truth about healing!"
1,Not great.,I was expecting more than a commercial for chiropractic care. I fell for it- hope you don't.
4,"Thorough, up-to-date, diverse","A well polished collection of essays on the schools of thought within a variety of American Civil War topics. Politics, economics, tactics, the role of women, blacks, and volunteers are covered by outlining the trends of the past 30 years in these fields and others. Read with Pressely's 'Americans Interpret Their Civil War' and Guelzo's 'Crisis of the American Republic' a solid foundation in Civil War historiography would be gained by the serious student of the American Civil War. 'Writing the Civil War' is written in such a fashion that a general familiarity with Civil War bibliography of the past 30 years is required; this book is probably not for the general undergraduate student or the Civil War military buff."
4,Grant does Spirituals,"This is Grant Green and Herbie Hancock doing another of Grant's theme albums, with the theme here being Spirituals. (Sunday Mornin' is the Gospel inspired album.) Anyway, its not straight ahead jazz, but Grant and Herbie play beautifully. And the music is very accessible. If you like Spirituals, you will like this cd, and Grant's albums like this are also a great introduction to jazz guitar music."
4,Greene,"Quick shipment, received in a very short time... good music, it has a feel that takes you away; definitely should be in guitar lovers collection."
2,not much info read in 2 hrs,"not much info, read in two hours. i have 5 planets in scorpio and two in the 8th house. i was hoping to get alot out of this book but was disapointed."
5,Do you have a Pluto problem?,"For those of us born with ""Pluto problems"", this book is a must! Donna Cunningham explains how Pluto brings some unusual and transformational life lessons to certain ""lucky"" people, so we'd better learn to deal with them! So here's how!"
2,Not So Pleased,"For the price, I could have done much better. I ordered the mints for a baby shower, and the bag looked as though it had been around a while. Definitely not impressed:*("
4,"New, different, exotic, sexy and spicy!","A brilliant start for a first publishing, hope to see more soon"
3,Not as expected,"I wouldn't go high on this book. It doesn't teach you much, only describes some simple techniques and ideas on what can you use embroidery, for example on a cushion cover (like you didn't know that before). To use the given designs that came on a cd-rom, you have to have a special software that costs you a small fortune. I am giving it 3 stars for the colors and designs only."
4,Great introduction to one of the best New Orleans Singers,"You know, I got hooked on Johnny after listening to his Percy Mayfield album. However, I didn't know how versatile the man was until I heard this superb Rounder anniversary release. The man goes from Dirty Funk (Body and Fender Man) through ballads (Wish I never loved you at all) to a version of ""Walking on a tight Rope"" that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The other track of note is ""A lot of living to do"" with Johnny accompanied by Harry Connick Jr.Bye Johnny....gonna miss you. This CD will do a lot to keep your memory alive"
5,Blurry In Orange,"I bought this video second-hand for the extortionate sum of 1 before discovering that many fans were deparately trying to locate a copy. So it may not have the sound or picture quality that we have come to expect these days, but as a teenager who is sadly too young to have seen the real thing, the video gives an impressive insight into what The Cure were as a live band. Another Cure creation which left me mouth-open in awe. Sometimes I feel like I was born too early..."
5,This concert is priceless...If you are a Cure Fan..!,"Absolutely one of the best Concert Videos ever made. The gothic setting in France's Orange Theatre, the long hours of playing and the great performance of the Cure, has made this one a Classic. They played out the true Cure style that night, with amazing guitar effects, beautiful keyboard parts, wonderful bass lines, and great songs like ""A play for today"", ""Push"", ""Killing an Arab"", ""Boys don't Cry"" and the incredible ""A night Like This"" among others..! I bought this video in 1993 and have been watching it over and over again ever since. I just got it in the VCD format also.. in other words.... THIS IS THE BEST CURE VIDEO AVAILABLE....GET IT WHILE THEY LAST....!"
5,Simply CHA-MAZING!!!,"This video is probably the best thing i've ever found at a usedcd shop (as well as the best $10 i ever spent). while it's not thefirst cure concert video i've seen, it is the best (in my opinion). just seeing robert smith ""dancing"" about like that is worth the cost of admission."
2,audio quality,"The audio quality is very low. Home video movie level. Sounds like it's been rendered in QuickTime on a default setting giving it a jet plane sound the whole time. And yes, it was produced in Malaysia for that market where consumers aren't likely to moan or discriminate as much, and I for one seriously wonder if the master recording was as poor or they just ruined it? Also the end of the CD is defective (mine anyway) so unless you are a real gotta-see-all fan your much better going for Trilogy which is amazing."
5,Definite must for the ETWNC library,"If you are a fan or modeler of the East Tennessee & Western North Carolina Railroad,or just a narrow gauge enthusiast in general, this book is required reading and should be part of the essential ET&WNC book list. This volume covers the early locomotives used on the ET, with many great photos and drawings and loads of excellent material in regards to those early ""iron horses"" on the early history of the railroad. There is even a special section devoted to specifics on modeling these locomotives in various scales. Buy it!"
4,Excellent Assortment of Top Tenors,"This is a great collection of tenor aria performances. The quality of the recordings is really excellent, as is the variety of performers. The main reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that there is no interpretation or explanation of the arias themselves, or of the background of the performers. I was also disappointed that there was no recording of Franco Corelli. I hope that more videos such as this one are produced in the near future."
4,A True Pleaser,"As a university voice teacher I am often asked by students what cd/dvd I recommend. I can strongly recommend this dvd to everyone. It was pleasing to see the ""Three Tenors"" selections come from the early 80's when their voices were still impressive. Pavarotti is, in my opinion, in a class of his own here. Domingo delightfully lacks that pushed sound that became so prevalent later on. The others are very enjoyable as well."
5,Cheap - Cheap,"Arrived in time for Christmas, travel case is a joke (it's just a piece of paper wrapped around the soap). Over priced and not worth the $"
4,VERY convenient,"This is like a tiny version of the diaper genie! its an amazing product that u can slip into the diaper bag and use for soiled diapers. Ever get those moments where u are at a friends place and they have no bag in the garbage can in their bathrooms? well you wouldnt want to put a stinky diaper in there! This is so perfect for those situations..u pull out a piece of the bag, tie it at one end, slip in the diaper, and tie the other end. Whats great about this is that there are no individ bags that u cut off....instead, it allows u to use only as much as u need for whatever purpos u need. Can be used for feminine pads, diapers, dirty clothes, spoiled food, etc... I love this item. And the refills are cheaper than most brands out on the market."
4,Great product,Easy to take along in the diaper bag for diapers or clothes. I love that you can create the bag size you need. Very practical.
5,what i wanted/needed.,"I like these. They're pretty handy. The ones I got were black instead of blue... which is cosmetic, but would have been nice to get the baby blue ones..I also would want to know if these bags are compostable or if there are compostable alternatives?!"
4,Great product,"This is a great product. My wife and I bought two, one for each of our diaper bags. It's like carrying our big Diaper Geenie in our diaper bags. All of the similar products that I found provide premade bags. This allows you to create the bag you need, big or small. I've used it to create a tiny bag for just one diaper and I've used it to create a bigger one for trash when we went on a picnic with our son. The price is more than right."
5,Great product!,"We looked at the diaper genie system but the refills for it were so expensive that we opted instead for a Diaper Champ and these bags. Love the bags versatility, threw a dispenser in the diaper bag for on the go and use them by the changing table in the diaper champ. When babies r us stopped carrying them I bought a zillion of them here on Amazon so we could make it through (hopefully) till we are potty trained. It's a great product that I could not make it through a day without!"
2,Avoiding the Bible belt,"I heard about this book on NPR. I love varied religious imagery, and this is certainly an interesting mix. However, you wonder what it is about the author that led him to avoid the Southeast, considered the Bible Belt of our continent. When I think of the prevalence of artists influenced by their faith in Appalachia, and the ""praise anywhere"" strategies employed by all classes in the Southeast, a piece is missing of what would have been an amazing patchwork of fill-in-the blank-here American faith."
5,Better Fathering is Here at Last,"Father Courage is the perfect gift for any working couple raising a family. It's a smart, detailed, practical book about American fathers who are actually changing the pattern and breaking with the past and reorganizing their lives so that they share in the parenting and the home building and the maintenance of the family. The wonderful thing about Suzanne Braun Levine's interviews is that they are not pie-in-the-sky success stories; they are about real men and women struggling to work out a new system that serves them and their kids better. Once you read this book, you see, it can be done; the old song about the father who worked all the time and never knew his kids and then as an old man bemoaned the fact that his son ""had turned out just like me"" -- that song doesn't have to be true any more. My boy just got married. I'm sending Father Courage to him as a post-wedding present."
1,Disappointment,This book did not deliver its promise even though the topic as such is very interesting. The book is a collection of quotations from other books and other sources with personal opinion on validity from the author. General structure of the book lacks clarity and illustrations and in addition the content is repetative.
4,New definitions for arias and Lieder,"Creative is the word here. Innovative also fits. And fresh is another apt adjective. The result practically defies genre classification. ""Classical crossover"" might describe this CD the best.The most important thing is the fact that this blending works, and it brings out a previously overlooked quality in such songs as ""It's Over"", ""Reach out, I'll Be There"", and ""The Ladies Who Lunch"". And on the other hand, this blending makes pieces such as ""Zwielicht"", ""Nessun Dorma"", and ""Larghetto"" more accessible to a larger audience.A major consideration here is that neither the classical nor the popular works are compromised. This CD deserves to be a lot more popular than it is."
5,Realy like the book,"I chose this book because a friend had cooked a meal for my husband and me using recipes from it. The meal was delicious. The book is lovely, with great pictures and very complete directions for cooking each dish It includes variations for some favorite recipes and some new things that I have never tried before."
1,not very heavy duty,"This tool never even made it onto the jobsite. Just testing in the workshop proved too much! The chuck spun out of round, and the motor was taxed and stripped trying to run a 3/4 auger. Even a large Irwin speedbore proved too much. I am O.K with a drill not being able to spin a bit-I will back off and try a smaller size. But this tool just seems to strip the gears way too easily. I tried 2 of these, figuring I might have gotten a lemon, but 2 lemons? The gears sound like they are cheaper quality. I think next time I will look at the small Makita corded or perhaps the Hitachi corded or cordless."
2,Excellent idea/ poor execution,"I'm a contractor, so I use my tools all the time and rely on them. Most of my hand tools are Bosch, but they don't have a full size right angle cordless drill, so I purchased the Dewalt. The Dewalt is inferior to Bosch in so many ways. First, the reverse switch is too small and hidden. It's difficult to switch when you're under a cabinet or in a tight space and try with just one hand. Secondly, the chuck is difficult to tighten and again requires two hands. Try a Bosch chuck, and you'll instantly know why the Dewalt chuck is worthless. Third, if it falls, the battery typicall falls out. Hey, no one wants to drop their tools, but it happens. When it does, I just want to pick it up, not reassemble it. So, in a nut shell, I haven't been impressed and only use this when it's absolutely necessary for the space. I'll be selling it soon as I'm getting the new Bosch Lithium drivers. They work great for the occasional tight space with none of the draw backs listed above."
2,cordless right angle drill,I purchased the drill and only used it a couple of time-4-5 and the chuck broke. I have recently had a corded impact wrench and an XRP drill go out. Much poorer quality than my previous buys. Have started moving towards Hatichi.
3,Color yellow- lemon,"This tool worked great for about three months, then while driving a#10 sheet metal screw the trigger froze in the on position, smoke started coming out of the battery pack, the only way to stop it was to disconnect the battery. I'm a cabinetmaker and this is one of the better right angle drills I've owned, it's a bit heavy and the forward and reverse switch is hard to use. The batteries last a long time, I can be on the job all day without charging them,nice.The keyless chuck is one of the best I've used, I hope this is just one of those lemons you get every now and again because I was really begining to like this tool."
4,Scrapbookers will love the scrapbooking story!,"Our son (age 2) LOVES this book & asks for it every night! One of the stories is called ""Pooh's Scrapbook"" which is really fun for scrapbookers. :) Here's an excerpt:""What if we made a Sunny Day Scrapbook?"" said Piglet.""A book of scraps?"" asked Pooh, who was thinking it sounded a little silly, though he didn't want to say so.""No,"" said Piglet, ""a colorful book, filled with special pictures and words - you know, scraps of memories.""""A memory book! What a clever idea,"" said Pooh."
5,Yummy macaroons,I had to buy these online because I couldn't find them anywhere locally. They are rather big- I think about300 calories and 6 grams of fiber each. They taste really good and shipment was received quickly. I wouldbuy from this seller again.
4,Liked it,This book was good and it was so sad at the same time. I think I shed a few tears. Great read I think that readers will enjoy this.
5,Great story!,"Loved this book, great story line, grabbed my attention and held it throughout the entire book, need more like this one"
3,Soccer Secrets Complete Boxed Set,"I purchased the set for help with coaching a U14 team. I was somewhat disappointed in the actual technical content of DVDs. This is definetly for beginner coaches, even the advance tape was on the simplistic side. I purchased the Coerver and Vogelsinger series prior to buying this collection and those two are hard acts to follow. If you want some mildly inspirational and simplistic technical instruction buy Soccer Secrets. But I feel there are much better options out there Coerver/Vogelsinger). Good for the girls not so good for coaches!"
2,Not Much Substance,"If I hadn't gotten these DVDs for free, I would have been _really_ disappointed. As a previous reviewer stated, even the ""advanced"" DVD was pretty basic, and the things that are taught don't have a lot of detail - just a few demonstrations. I'd definitely recommend a decent Coerver class over these DVDs.In addition, all of the ""extras"" on the DVDs are the same on all three. I also got tired of the sappy planted questions from the girl demonstration teams.If your kid is a Mia Hamm fanatic, and just likes to hear her talk, this is fine, but don't expect a lot of exciting Mia Hamm demonstrations, or a great learning experience/inspiration."
4,Satisfied,I received this order really fast and other than some of the audio out of sync on some places everything else was good
5,"The Lesbian ""Big Chill"" with attitude","This movie allows the viewer to step into a ""fantasy"" reality where girl gets girl, but in doing so, shows the construction and deconstruction of the characters' lives, memories and dreams. The eb and flow of the movie allows you to look at your own life and the choices you have made. EVERYTHING RELATIVE delivers a happy ending that allows viewers to hope they can also find the same through their chaos."
3,OK to watch once,"I saw this film once. I bought it quite some time ago and have only watched it once. I would recommend renting it instead of buying it. The plot was somewhat interesting and the movie had it's moments, but overall it was just-""OK"". The end of the movie is when it gets a bit better and there are intimate scenes between the characters. Borrow it from a friend or rent it. It is worth seeing once, but not worth owning."
5,I'd Reccomend It To Anyone...,"Okay, so it's true, the acting isn't the greatest. However, if you're looking for a movie to cuddle up and watch on a Friday night when you have nothing better to do, this is the one. There are a lot of really bad lesbian movies out there, and you could definitely do worse than ""Everything Relative."""
3,"Acting medicore, but relationship deveolpment is intriguing",Great plot to this film. The acting starts out being a bit medicore but the actors get comfortable and seem to settle down. The relationship and character development are quite intriguing and compelling. It is a film that you think in the beginning is not worth the time to watch but end up hoping it doesn't end. It is definitely a film I want to add to my collection.
5,PSI Mini 5-Piece HSS Wood Lathe Chisel Turning Set,"The PSI Mini Turning Wood Lathe 5 piece Chisel Turning Set were sent in excellent condition, as was the packaging. I've yet to use them, but I foresee them turning all woods with no problems. Friends that bought this set, said they were outstanding turning chisels. I'll let you know how they work as soon as I use them. My first project will be a chess set.Thanks you PSI for sending them in a timely manner and perfect packing. And thank you to Amazon for backing up PSI's tools."
4,"A great deal, for the price","I see similar 5 piece ""mini"" tool sets nearly identical to this one, selling for much higher (Sorby, Delta, etc). I have never been able to find any difference between them. These ""name brand"" tools sell for $125 and higher. And for what? The name on the label? These PSI tools are a great deal, for the price."
5,Great tools,This is one of the best tools sets that I have ordered and put to work. The wooden storagecase is very nice and built well.
5,Good product/good price,I am new to wood turning so I have nothing to compare these to. I got a Jet lathe and these tools to make tuning pegs for a baroque lute I am building. The tools seem to work great and with no tutoring at all I'm turning out usable tuning pegs after my 3rd piece of wood. I'd definitely recommend these to a friend.
3,you get what you pay for but...,"I have owned two sets of these tools because they are cheap, the right size for my applications, and I can grind them for special applications. However, they are not tempered well. I have had one shatter when it fell on the concrete floor and another snap while turning - quite a sensation! Anyhow, know what you are getting. You can get the same tools as Jet Mini-lathe tools, made by Crown, for about $80 - much nicer steel."
3,Good quality for limited budget,Good inexpensive set for the money. I feel that the smaller gouges could use a little harder tempering!
2,Breakable Buy,"I am a novice wood turner and I bought these tools for the price. Though I should have expected it, these tools were very cheap quality. I've had to regrind them two to three times on centered pieces. They chip and break easily, and my bowl gouge metal actually bent because it couldn't take the pressure of a centered piece of pine. I was very disappointed and am planning on buying a new set. Note that these tools are smaller than one would assume."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"Don't buy this book! The 1"" of the text is cut off on the right side of the borders. The scans of the images are horrible. The text and images (of much higher quality) can be found on the web."
1,Do Not Trust BZB Global,I placed and order with this company and after 1 week I get an email stating that the order is canceled. After talking to Amazon customer service they just said canceled per merchant request. I want to know why! Of course no one can tell me. They also state in the email that my credit card was not charged however the charges were taken out the day the order was placed. They have since been returned but maybe they should not be taken out until they are sure that the order will ship. I am very displeased with this seller and wanted to let other know.
1,Worst Customer Service EVER,"I ordered two cases a little over a week ago, and my order was canceled with no explanation. I see this has not just been happening to me, and in some cases it has happened more than once. A cancelation because there is not enough product is one thing, but a cancellation with no explanation is something entirely different. Horrid customer service! Would never buy from this seller again. Amazon needs to ban this seller!"
1,Too good to be true!,"As the other reviewers have stated, I ordered this deal not once, but twice and both times it was canceled by the company. Why am I told in an email that it is not available, yet it is still listed on Amazon? Do not order from this company."
1,WASTE OF TIME,Ordered almost 2 weeks ago and got a notice today saying canx. Now I see all the reviews here and understand this was a bad decision....I better go check my creditcard for the credit according to the other reviews.
1,Waste of time,I placed an order in good faith well over a week ago. Just received an e-mail that my order had been cancelled with no reason given. Apparently this is a great way to do business. I was unaware that this type of behavior is encouraged within Amazon. Bravo!
1,Not the company to do business with!,Very disappointed in this company! A week after ordering they cancel my order with no explanation... and the product is still listed for the same price I tried to purchase at. WHY? You should have followed through. This may ruin you.
1,Wish that the company would be removed,"I was waiting for this to ship and instead I got an two emails stating that that the order has been canceled. The email(below) also said to go back and try again. If BZG has no plans to fulfill the orders they shouldn't be selling anything! Bad business practice!!!We're writing to inform you that your order XXXXX from BZB Global has been canceled.Your credit card was not charged for this order.If you're still interested in this item, please search for it again on Amazon.com.We've included your order details below for reference.We value you as a customer and hope you will continue shopping on Amazon.com."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THEM,ordered this product i guess when all these others did and they put a hold on my card and then cancelled my order... now i feel like i need to watch for suspicious activity almost like i gave my card number out to a shady outfit... do not try this
1,DO NOT BUY FROM BZB GLOBAL!!!,"This review has nothing to do with the dish soap, because I love Joy dish soap. This review is to let everyone know that they do not need to buy from this company...BZB Global. I really don't know what their goal is or whatever, but they do not provide good, if any, customer service. I ordered this products only to get a cancellation email almost two weeks later. I called Amazon and they gave me the number to contact BZB Global, but of course you can not get a hold of them, because their mailbox is full. So I sent BZB Global an email and have never received a reply and that has been a couple of weeks ago. It would have been different if the pricing was an actual mistake, but the price on this product was the same for almost a month. So if you are thinking of buying this product, please DO NOT buy it from BZB Global."
1,Rude,"Amazon really needs to check out their sellers. I placed this order with it set to arrive some time this week, only to receive an email that the order had been canceled. So, I placed it again and this time, just two days later, that same email. This is a scam--"
1,Horrible horrible horrible,Placed an order on March 8th. Emailed them yesterday and now my order has magically vanished. SCAMMERS!!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!
1,Scam!,"I thought maybe this offer was too good to be true and it was. How does it take a week for Amazon to figure this out? At least my card wasn't charged, I guess."
1,amazon is just wrong for letting 42 people go through this,I hope this company never make another sale in their life for being so dirty I gave this product a 1 cause that's the lowest u can go but trust me when I tell u they don't even deserve that
1,do not trust BZB Global,"They will charge your credit card, and wait two weeks and then cancel your order. I did get my money back- but still!!don't bother with this!!"
1,confused and disappointed,This seems like an awesome deal....seems. But instead you place your order and then nothing. I had to email them to ask where my order was. No email back just a cancellation. And I look again and its still listed?? CONFUSED. This company needs to pull its self together. Sell it or dont!!!!!!!!! Thanks for wasting my time.
1,WTH?,"Ordered 2 cases a week ago and order was cancelled without reason! Amazon said my card was not charged, but why was it cancelled? I'd like to order again but wonder if the same thing will happen."
2,Bad business!,"Don't buy from this company. I ordered and payed with GC, over a week later my order was cancelled without explanation. If you are going to offer your product on here then you need to fulfill your end of the agreement. Bad business! Will not buy your product again."
1,DO NOT TRUST BZB GLOBAL!,BZB Global will take your money for a false sale and wait two weeks before they cancel your order and return your money! They didn't bother responding to any customer service emails or update me at all about the order-just canceled it out of the blue! Seller shouldn't be allowed to sell on such a trustworthy site such as Amazon.com...dumb scammers!
1,Cancelled Order,My order was cancelled with no explanation or apology. Don't think I will consider ever giving this company my business.
1,canceled my order with no explanation.,"So, placed an order for 2 cases. After a week, they canceled my order for no reason. Didn't explain or anything. Bad business. I mean if you're still going to have this product listed, you better ship your stuff. Jerks."
5,A book that lets you experience GOD,This book is very well written. IF any Christian is looking to strengthen his/her relationship with Christ this is the book that will help you do it. If you go through the book and do all of the activities and really think about and meditate the questions and answers it will bring you into a closer walk with the LORD. It has helped me out tremendously and I recommend you do it with at least a group of 5-6 people and meet once a week to discuss each of the 12 units..
5,Excellent resource for examining your relationship with God,This workbook brings us into a closer relationship with God by helping us discover ways in which we can and should be experiencing God on a daily basis. It offers numerous scripture references and provides space for one to record what God is saying to you about those scriptures. One of the basic ideas is that God is always at work. We need to discover what He is doing and join Him. In doing so we will experience Him in a real and dynamic fashioin
5,phenomenal,"Plunges the seeker into the very Throne Room of God, to practice listening for the very voice of God. A fantastic study of how God has spoken in the past, and how he wants to speak to you today."
1,Read with caution.,"The author says 'agree with God even when you're not sure what He's saying'. When you read such you should proceed with caution because that's exactly what a cult would say. As a Christian, Jesus wants us to know everything - how can we follow something vague? God gave human beings a wonderful gift that seems to be dormant in much Christian teaching these days -it's called 'common sense'."
5,Life Changing,"Excellent book! I recommend this to anyone who is going through a tough time. It may sound unbelievable, but I now have a better marriage and home life. I've become a better parent too!This book has something for everyone and is a real eye-opener!"
5,Experiencing God - Knowing and doing the will of God - work,"Our church used the workbook as a twelve week bible study. I have been in several bible studies, i.e. Disciples but ""Experiencing God"" shows through biblical truths how our personal relationship with Jesus Christ must be first and foremost before we can serve him. Previously, I gave God a checklist of things I might do for him, using only the resourses I have. Experiencnng God shows how God invites us to do his work. We must know how and when he speaks to us and faith and action is required to make major adjustments in our life to obey him. Only through these steps are we able to do ""God Size"" tasks.The authors do an excellent job of putting this in laymans language, giving personal examples of how God changed their lives,brought life into churches and spreading the gospel to others. I praise and thank God, he gave me the opportunity to study ""Experiencing God""."
5,This Book is Changing My Life,"A friend of mine suggested I use this workbook to help me in my walk with God. I am only a quarter of the way through the exercises and the book has already begun to change my life.If you seek to know God or want to move closer to Him -- and are ready to commit to His will -- you will NOT regret buying this book. Simply approach the exercises with a prayerful, honest and open heart, God will do the rest."
5,Life-Changing Study,"The below December 8, 2005 review serves to remind me once again that Satan and his anti-Christ cohorts are always at work trying to drive a wedge between God and God's children. This workbook, and the intense and demanding 12-week small group course that accompanies it, can radically change your life for the Kingdom's sake. It will help you build the strong love relationship with the Lord that brings purpose and fulfillment to your life and fills you with joy and contentment. I have read many Christian books over the years and have taken several courses, but nothing can compare to Experiencing God. I thank God every day for Henry Blackaby and the Spirit-guided work he has done."
4,Good stuff,"Just started going through this material, and I am really being blessed by it. Given my own theological background, I can't say I agree with all of it (when do you find something you always agree with!), but I really like the overall emphasis: it's not about you, it's about GOD! You can't just fill in the blanks; you've got to think about what they're saying, and apply it to yourself. Then I think the lights will come on, and the Spirit will start pointing you toward a radical God-centeredness.I was studying this book along with the book of Jonah, and the parallels are neat. Anyway, this book is helpful. Good stuff!"
4,Experiencing God.... a good experience,"The book was in good condition, as it was hard to find because it's out of print now.Really good book to understand and develop your relationship with God.The shipping of this product came really fast and was an easy transaction."
1,Someone (Blackaby) understanding of God-not mine for sure,"This book had me going for awhile but then I saw its narrowmindness . In a way, author made a ""spiritual theory"" of experiencing God under which he invites you to put your own life. After reading this book I am seriously start to think about Orthodoxy. Taking verses from Bible putting them out of context or putting them in a way that will be profitable for spiritual theory of Blackaby. I mean every one of us Protestants can write a book about his or her own spiritual way to God and then present it as the right way to follow God!?!? Ridiculous."
1,you really do get what u pay for!,"I wasn't really happy with the thinning shears because they really didn't do the the job that I was looking for them to do. For starters, when I received the shears, there were already chips on the blade. Every time when I used them, they got caught in the chipped part of the blade. They also wouldn't cut any hair at all. Also, when I closed the shear on the hair, they got pulled on the hair. They are a great price but you always get what you pay for. There are definitely better ones out there. If you want quality, sometimes you have to pay for it."
2,Directions confusing and incomplete,"I too tried the folding chair and it is impossible to assemble as described. I've made and attempted other pieces: Chaise Lounge (completed, but had to figure some things out myself); Wattle Chair: Could not complete. You cannot build a chair with nails - it does not hold together. Seat instructions confusing, couldn't get it to work. Many hours wasted. Grapevine & Willow frame: completed but it is not very strong - again nails used, being nailed into soft pith wood does not work;Basket Planter: Top of basket sides will not hold if directions are followed. I have made this basket a few times but have had to adapt and change it radically for it to work and be strong.Hostess Stand:worked. I keep trying these projects because the ideas look so great. I've never done any woodworking before and have encountered a lot of frustration with this book. Plan on figuring out the construction for yourself. You may want to use junk materials for a dry run."
5,book order,"My first experience ordering from Amazon. The book arrived sooner than predicted, in very good shape. I would definitely order from this supplier again."
5,Not perfect - but a Classic all the same,"Donnie O'Quinn tells you everything you need to know about modern, DTP-based print publishing in one book! Well, of course that's not true - but he really does get to the bone of what someone *ought* to know. Despite sending documents to printers and repro-houses over a number of years I still learned plenty, and was enthused to become a meticulous 'print publisher'. Believe me, someone new to, or on the periphery of, print publishing could learn more skills and better practice than some folks who've worked in the industry for years just be absorbing what's in the book. I'd reccomend it to any pre-press worker, designer, DTP-operator, hands-on editor, production staff. It's a classic."
5,Fasco Inducer Blower,I forgot to rate this product last year when I purchased it. It is still running and very quite. Don't understand some of the bad reviews???
2,"It works, thats all I can say.","The little black plastic piece that cools the motor is very cheap. If anything bumps this piece it will break. I broke it off and luckily the HVAC Megastore shipped me a new one, and sent the old one back to the manufacturer to replace it. When then blower starts up its not a quiet as I would have hoped. I am no expert but it would have been nice to have a gasket with it, mine is installed metal to metal, but the seal is decent."
1,Goodman draft inducer B1859005,Very impressed with the construction. The open frame and twin cooling fans for the motor realy impressed me. The wiring conections are also very well done. I also received it quicker than expected.
4,"Breathable, stylish, generally comfortable, well made","I first tried on this shoe in a department store, then bought it for about $100 less on Amazon. I've found that a slip-on is consistent with my gradually increasing laziness, and this is one of the best looking slip-on shoes - the best for the price. It is also exceptionally breathable without advertising my often embarassing socks. My only complaint is that Seibel insoles are slightly less comfortable than some other shoes (Clark Privos are the best, but don't look this good)."
4,Nutcracker CD,Great purchase! I was more than happy with the product and the speed with which it was delivered.
4,Early Harlan Ellison....,"The volume contains short stories and an absorbing novella by Harlan Ellison.These stories are among his first ever, and are more SF than fantasy.Perhaps not his best work, but I found all immensely readable.The cover art is just beautifulHighly recommended."
5,Even more beautiful than the photo,"We just received this lamp yesterday, but I wanted to write immediately as there are no other reviews on Amazon. The lamp is very beautiful and adds a warm glow to the room. I was worried about it being too bright with three 100 watt bulbs so I used 75 watt bulbs instead. We might change up or substitute equivalent CFL bulbs because the shade does so much to warm the tone of the light.Installation is very straight-forward. I found that one part was unclear: it tells you to tighten up the stem that attaches to the hose coupling by tightening the hex nut with pliers. The hex nut there remains several inches below at the upper part of the threaded area of the stem. Other than that, was very clear.I highly recommend this lamp. Our bedroom is medium-sized and the light fits perfectly."
3,"Good, but could be better.","Swagman's claim on this rack is that it:""provides the ultimate in flexibility to accommodate a variety of bike frame designs""So I figured I'd spend a little extra $$ on the rack and avoid buying a bunch of crossbars. Unfortunately, the rotating cradles are so big that quite a few bikes (including my GT XCR) start having trouble fitting into them without quite a bit of twisting and pushing, on top of that pretty much render crossbars useless.It is a good rack but I'd recommend getting the non-rotating cradles if you really want more flexibility in the bikes it can accommodate."
3,things to think about,"Seems to be a good rack though it does sway a lot. so much that i bought the other piece to stablize it which adds to the price. also, just FYI, i cannot fit my 4runner in the garage with the rack attached to the car, or i should say i can't close my garage door. just something to think about before buying as that thought never entered my mind.:)"
1,awful,this table is heavy difficult to pack and and put together and it broke after having it a couple of days. the handle broke off right as i picked it up. it is shoddy and it smells awful DO NOT BUY. i sent it back and now i am looking for a diffrent table.
4,Perfect-Love it!,"I have had this table for over 4 yrs.I find it very sturdy & easy to use.It is quite comfortable as well, i have fallenasleep on it many x's as has my son.I am crazy about it. It is a bit heavy for me,so i do use it at home only, and it is for personal useso do not need to take it out.I would say for the pricethe quality is excellent, and it is perfect to use in the home."
3,Simply OK,"The construction seems to be sturdy and will provide sufficient support.The quality of finish does not correspond with the price even after the discount as shown.Packaging is not sufficient to prevent damage in shipment. Mine came with a cut on a side, so I will be able to tolerate it.It is made in China if it matters to you.I wish I made a different selection."
4,Ballet photographer par excellence,"The late Russian born French photographer Serge Lido, born Sergej Lidoff in Moscow 1906, maybe the most famous ballet photographer in the world, has produced a very great number of photographic essays. This album deals mainly with ""young faces"" from various countries. There are short biographic notes on each dancer. Irene Lidova, Mrs. Lido, wrote the text, which is only in French. Forewords also in French."
1,I'll Never Get Those Hours Back,"What a poorly written book. I actually felt embarrassed for Cook (I'm not a fan per se, but I have read 3 or 4 of his books). And he should feel embarrassed, too. The book cost me only a buck at a church rummage sale; I'm giving it one star because I have to and because I got it cheap. But reading the blasted thing took several hours I'll never get back. Ugh."
2,Ridiculously short jacket,"My son is only 2 1/2 and the bottom of the jacket came to a little over an inch above the waistband of his jeans. If it is this short on a 2 year old, I can't imagine what it would look like on a child who wears a size 3 or 4. If your child is just barely growing into a 2T, then it might work. My son is beginning to grow out of his 2T clothing and this was way too short. Size aside, the jacket was in good condition. It would've made a very cute costume if it fit properly. It would be nice if the manufacturer would make the jacket length part of its description."
2,2-4T Toddler 50s Rebel Costume Jacket,The jacket is quite expensive but in not made very well. It suited its purpose for Halloween. My son was a 50s greaser and thankfully we had mild weather that day otherwise he would have froze. The jacket is made quite shabbly and not warm whatsoever.
4,Fun for family,"Although this movie might be just a little silly at times, it does carry some weighty topics such as families that are perhaps not as typical as others and the message that perfection is not always such a great goal."
5,we love it!,"Great family movie, we have loved it for years! Shipping was even better than we expected, very prompt!"
2,Not packaged for shipping,I'm not sure how nice this table may have been since it arrived broken. The box is sooo heavy I'm pretty sure the delivery guy had to just aboout push it out of the truck on to the ground. It took two of us to get it up to the deck. The quarter inch thick styrofoam probably didn't protect much. The granite was cracked.
1,What a piece of junk!,"I bought 3 of these fireplaces. The regulators all stopped working almost immediately. I contacted Coleman, and was told to send the regulators in for replacement. It's been 3 weeks, and all Coleman can say is that ""we""re processing the paperwork"", which I assume means, ""We can't fix these darn things or find replacements for them""! What a rip off! I will never buy another Coleman product!"
4,Nice item but do not expect a lot of heat from it.,"The product looks very nice once assembled. However during the assembly you will notice that the parts are typical ""made in china"" quality.Good conversation piece. Creates cozy environment. Gas consumption is as stated or better. Much better if not used at full power. Serves well as the table too. The main concern is how long it will last. I suspect that the metal parts will rust pretty quickly if exposed to moisture, but time will tell. It has the cover but I am not sure if it will make things better. Moisture captured under such covers usually make thinks even worse. Anyway , it looks nice and works nice. I only wish it produced more heat."
4,Good sports movie,"This was a great film for a lazy, rainy Sunday. Mark Wahlberg is perfect for this sort of role, and Christian Bale stole every scene he was in.I also recommend ""Warrior"", a terrific sports flick set in the world of MMA."
4,Love it!,"I love this movie and I was glad to get it for a decent deal on Amazon, this is one you must see a couple of times."
4,"Good, but only because of Bale","I am writing this review as a casual boxing movie fan. Having seen all of the offerings over the past decade or so, this movie was entertaining in comparison only because of Christian Bale's excellent representation of the would-be champ who (tripped) knocked down Sugar Ray. He nails the quirky and witty remarks & mannerisms of Micky Ward's brother, Dicky. Wahlberg's performance is essentially a mail-in ... he fits the role well, but seemed uninspired. This is coming from someone who typically enjoy's Mark Wahlberg's movies, too. Amy Adams plays the (at first) hard-to-get bar maid and eventual love interest of Micky.Obviously, the movie is more about the messed up Ward family dynamics and the love/(not quite) hate relationship between two brothers carving their niche in the boxing world.Overall, 4 stars ... something for both men & women in the movie."
4,"Predictable and formulaic, but compelling and enjoyable boxing film","Part ""Rocky,"" part ""The Wrestler,"" and part ""Million Dollar Baby,"" this film takes all sorts of sports film clichés and somehow works in spite of them. It is one of many recent films taking place in Boston with characters dropping their r's (get in the caa) and chain-smoking (along with ""Mystic River,"" ""The Departed,"" and ""Edge of Darkness""), and while it is no ""Raging Bull,"" it is still very, very good. Mark Walhberg gives a typically strong performance as Micky Ward, and Amy Adams is always good in anything, but it is really Christian Bale, as Ward's half-brother Dicky Eklund, who steals the show. I cannot think of anyone more deserving of a best supporting actor award."
3,At least I still think Wahlberg is hot,"This is a poorly done film, quite a step down because of the other better made movies about fighting. Christian Bale...he will do anything to make his character believable, losing so much weight and looking like a crackhead. I admire him tremendously. Mark Wahlberg, he was not allowed to break out that magnificent performance he always gives, as well as his girlfried, Amy Adams. The whole trashy family thing, with the ridiculous sisters....yak. But, it was based on a true story so I guess all that fried hair was necessary LOL. Overall, I was disappointed."
3,"Solid start, fades towards the end...","This was a really rousing movie for the first 2/3rds or so. The characters were interesting, the acting and the plot were all great. Then it lost its way a bit as it geared up for the climax which was a bit anti-climactic. Still, a good, realistic and gritty look at boxing."
1,Pugilistic Pap,"We sat through the entire nearly two hours of this, waiting for it to develop into more than a bunch of low-lifes throwing insults and fists at each other. We were disappointed.The film offers an up close view of the incredibly depressing life of a bunch of losers in Lowell, MA, one of whom eventually manages to make it big. And, oh yeah, there were a few boxing scenes thrown in there. But there were no characters you'd be interested in enough to care about what happens to them. When the end credits rolled, my only thought was 'so what'?Judging by the high ratings many other reviewers gave this, my opinion is apparently in the minority. The only thing I can think of that might explain this is different attitudes toward dialog. So, if your idea of a clever, inspired script is one where the f-bomb gets dropped every 30 seconds or so, add another star to my rating."
1,Low life trash in predictable story,How many boxng movies can be made where you know the star's going to win the big one at the end? Not much story line and the characters were all total low life trashy people who had to use the 'F' word in every thing they said. I was bored and started fast forwarding the fight scenes to get to the 'big finale'.
2,"The Fighter, disappointing.","Rented ""The Fighter"" last night. What a disappointment. This could of been such a great movie if they would of focused more on Ward's boxing and less on his nutzo family. Thought I rented a boxing story and instead I rented a Jerry Springer family with a little boxing thrown in. The acting by Bale was superb and Whalberg's acting was pretty good too. In the end great acting, or any other part of great film making cannot rescue a story line that would of been better suited for ""Jerry Springer, the Movie""."
1,I hate the fact I couldnt watch it!,"In order to download the movie I had to buy the movie first. Seemed odd. Then when I tried to download it, AMAZON told me they could not dowload it because I was not in a country that AMAZON was permitted to dowload to my machine (I was in my apartment in Paris). So I was charged anyway, with an incipid apology.By the way, after this awful experience I tried iTunes. They didnt have that prohibition. Score: Amazon 0 iTunes 1"
1,Yo Adrien!,"I will start off by saying I think Christian Bale and Marc Walberg are crap actors. I also don't like the fact it appeared as though Christian Bale was on crystal meth in this movie, hence all the weight loss and cracked out looking face. The other factor why I didn't like this film is that the premise of the movie has already been done, 5 times. Rocky 1,2,3,4,5. This was an overated piece of crap."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!,EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE WAS SO LOW-CLASS. CRACK WAS SHOWN BEING SMOKED....AMY ADAMS LOOKED LIKE A WHORE...I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH WATCHING THIS MOVIE...REALLY BAD!! ABSOLUTELY HATED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT BOXING....NOT REALLY.
2,It stalled a couple of times...,"I thought the ""Used - Very good"" condition would let me watch the entire movie but it stalled 2 times. You could notice multiple but minor scratches. In the end, I went back to the main menu and selected the following chapter and was able to continue and finish."
2,Broken case upon receipt,"The DVD/blu ray case was punctured as soon as I opened it, doesn't vouch well for the integrity of the product."
5,Against All Odds?,"The stories surrounding this instant boxing classic is really what makes the magic happen. Mark Wahlberg spent over a year of his life preparing for his role as Micky Ward, researching the boxer's life and times in Lowell MA and training for this authentic portrayal. He gave place to Christian Bale, who found his niche in history with an Oscar performance as Best Supporting Actor in playing Ward's brother, boxer/trainer Dicky Eklund. Ward's Rockyesque rise from club fights to the world title is paralleled by Eklund's triumph over crack addiction. The authenticity of the flick was guaranteed by the true-life figures in the tale remaining on location in Lowell for consultation as Wahlberg sought to make this saga as accurate as possible.For those who want to see Ward at his absolute best, get a video copy of his first fight with Arturo Gatti. It is an astounding ""Fight of the Century"" that would be the icing on a magnificent cake presented by master chef Wahlberg."
4,Watch for Dickie,"Great character acting and some really unique material based on a true story. I have no complaints with the script, the acting, or the actual movie making part of this film. The best actor portrayal in this is the character Dickie played by Christial Bale. The director did a great job unfolding this as a unique viewpoint, and it was entertaining-but not amazingMy overall vote is this one is not a keeper, not a movie you need to watch over and over, and not a big enough Rocky triumph. You just felt like the lead character was going to get sucked back into the dysfunction as soon as the credits rolled.No happy place for the viewer to glob into. Let your boyfriend watch it while you clean out your closet."
5,Awesome with Christian Bale!,"Excellent movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this twice.Christian Bale is obviously a very talented and versatileactor. It says that it stars Mark Wahlberg and co-starsBale but Bale is quite the scene-stealer & obvious starin this. Mark is good too as always but continues to playthe same roles repeatedly; however the comedy he was innot long ago was excellent where he was the co-star and surprisedus all with a new type of role.I highly recommend this movie. (sorry, but the title of thecomedy with Mark excapes me right now)."
5,Bale's and acting Beast,"I was not expecting this be so great, this movie is awesome and the second best boxing movie behind Raging Bull. Bale is amazing plan and simple rent or buy what ever just watch this movie. You will love it, if not your an idiot."
3,Fighting myself not to turn this off,"Okay, I agree that Christian Bale AND Melissa Leo both deserved the Oscars they won for this movie. BUT...I really couldn't stomach most of this movie BECAUSE of their performances. They both played seriously dysfunctional people and they were just too difficult to watch for the entire length of this film.I wish I could have seen more of Mark Wahlberg in his role as ""Irish"" Micky Ward. I thought this movie was about his fighting comeback. Instead I got close to two hours of dysfunctional family."
4,NOT Just Another Rocky Movie,Enjoyable because it's NOT just Rocky XV. Its more than a David vs Goliath story. The story-line of the family stress outside the ring carries the movie.
2,Christian Bale saved this movie,"I watched The Fighter last night. I believe the ""white trash"" family was so oversimplified/caricatured that it made them all look like their IQ's hovered somewhere around 70, just above the cut off for intellectual disability and definitely bordering on emotional/developmental disability. Anyway, Christian Bale's performance was outstanding... the only well written/played character in the movie. I had a difficult time keeping Mark Walberg's ""Boogie Nights"" character separated from his performance in this movie! Except for Bale, the movie was a disappointment."
3,No big deal.,"There is a very high rating of this film on internet movie database. I actually went to the theater to watch it and I don't think it deserves anything more than a 6/10. Wahlberg is OK, Amy Adams' character was quite despicable for some reason (maybe some sort of intelligent formula) and Christian Bale was the saving grace of the film.Very ordinarily narrated and the direction left me gasping out of despair at certain times, maybe it's the bad luck Wahlberg brings to any film featuring him.There were maybe 2 good scenes in the whole film.I could have lived my life without watching this film but I can't say that about some of the better films this year (Black Swan, T.S.N, Buried and The Town)Please watch the film before buying the DVD, it's over-rated in my view."
1,The Fighter,"The acting was fine and I know that in real life that people are prone to profanity but it isn't needed to get the point of the movie across. It diminishes the quality and, in this case, there is so much of it that the storyline becomes unimportant. If you tire of movies with an over-indulgence of profanity then this one isn't for you. This is a 'NO BUY' movie for us and I'm happy that we only rented it. It's a strike against Mark Wahlberg."
5,Inspiring,Amazing movie with amazing actors. Very inspiring story and the fact that it's true is awesome. Will watch again soon
3,"Very average, saved by Bale.",A very average film saved by Bale's engaging portrayal of Dicky Eklund.We're served typically stale formulaic puréed baby-food style cinema.Producers sometimes need to ask themselves do they need to tell the same story again and again and again and again.
3,great acting,This movie was very good because of the great acting. I was hoping for some fight scenes with Arturo Gatti.
4,"Ok, but dark and dysfunctional.","Comment: I can see why this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture. The acting was superb and the situations were real enough. For me though it was ""dark"" and a downer dealing with drug abuse and nonfunctional family life. I see enough of that for real. This movie reflects what I have heard about the ""sleaziness"" of boxing and the way some boxers rise from the bad side of life through it. The movie was technically ok but not my cup of tea. You should be in a ""neutral"" frame of mind as you watch it. It could be good for you."
4,a good watch,"i was surprised to see the rating on amazon was 3.5 stars, i think it deserves at least 4. i'm not too in to boxing but this movie kept me entertained every moment. it was worth the $3 to rent."
3,Good for a raining day,I think Christain Bale did a really good job getting into this role...the content shows the struggles of addictions and hope.
5,"the Fighter, movie",My husband and I loved this movie. It is entertaining and funny while still based on a true story. It is not violent but the language is strictly for adults. Lots of f--- type of language.
4,Really solid all around,Very solid film. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't absolutely blow me away as a film but Christian Bale was phenomenal and Mark Wahlberg/Rachel Adams gave a very solid performance as well. Could watch this one a few times.
3,"I Love, I Love, I Love, But...","I love Mark Wahlberg. I love Christian Bale. I love boxing and boxing movies. But...The movie was way too slow and predictable. It really should have been more about Micky Ward than Dicky Eklund.The Micky Ward vs. Arturo Gatti fights were the most incredible showing of determination, heart, valor, and true guts I have ever witnessed.If these fights were even partially shown in the movie, the non-boxing fans would have been shown the true character of Micky Ward.This movie, for some reason, wanted so much for us to feel sorry for and like Dicky Eklund, but this is where they went wrong."
4,About more than fighting,"This is not just a boxer movie. It is a story about two brothers, one of whom is a drug addict and a failed fighter, and the other, who has much more promise but must overcome his family's interference and opposition, especially as regards the woman he falls in love with and later marries.There is a lot of profanity as well as a lot of bloody fighting which will put off some viewers. However, the main storyline is compelling and it is based on a real family from Lowell, Massachusetts.Mark Wahlberg, Melissa Leo, and Christian Bale are great in their roles here, as is Jack McGee."
5,"A movie for everyone, not just fight fans","This movie is one that any boxer fan should see and a movie that any boxer or boxer trainer absolutely must see. Although I am a professional boxer trainer, I must mention that this movie isn't a movie just for boxing fans. Anyone who enjoys a good story of someone who struggled against the odds and still succeeded will enjoy this movie. In a sense, this is also a family film because it demonstrates the importance of family values and what it means to never put anything such as your profession or dreams before your family, and that you don't have to comprise family in order to accomplish your goals."
3,Speedy but some issues,Great pricing. Speedy delivery...certainly a plus. However packaging was a concern. DVD arrived crushed and was floating in the case. It suffered several scratches as a result. So far plays fine.
3,A Solid split,"This was my first experience with both of these bands when this first came out. While the Horna tracks may not be their best work, anyone who appreciates the first couple of releases from Deathspell Omega, Ildjarn etc. will find some very redeeming qualities in these tunes. Behexen offers 3 of the best songs they have written to date and slaughters Horna on this split. I have since tracked down all of their records and none of them quite have the intensity found on this split. If you are looking to start checking out Horna, start with the ""Sota"" EP. All in all, this split is well worth your money if you are looking to have your face torn off in the name of Satan with nothing but the utmost grimness."
4,Good Grommet,"What can you say about a three-inch circle of plastic?It is sturdy, the sliding piece stays attached. The top lip is a little thin, so your hole measurement needs to be pretty exact but that's nothing to complain about.If I needed another one, I'd buy the same one."
3,low cost grommet works as expected,"These are low cost plastic grommets. They work. Note that they require a 2 3/4 inch hole to install them. Don't buy a 3"" hole saw like I did, they fall right through the hole."
1,useless,"i have a 3 inch hole and this product slides right through the hole....there is no lip to hold it on the counter. i also cant use it because you cant open the hole all the way, only 1/2 way because the top doesn't come off, it only slides. i need to send these back."
5,Lack of commitment,"I made the purchase and the offer was a lie, two days after the purchase i received a cancelation of the order and the credit refund without any apparent reason or explanation about the cancelation of the purchase, for me it is lack of seriousness from amazon to its clients.."
3,Contour iSee 20 isn't so hot,"If you go to the contour design website, you can see pictures of the contour case. It looks deceiving once you have th case in your hands, because they provide you with this plastic clear sleeve you are supposed to put on your ipod before shoving it into the actual case. Well, even though that plastic sleeve is thin, it is just thick enough to make the ipod too fat for the case. When you push the ipod + sleeve into the case, the sleeve starts to bunch up and creates waves that cover the screen. These waves are not usually noticeable when the ipod is on.Additionally, once you get the ipod + sleeve into the case, there's no coming out. I had to shove it in the case pretty darn hard.If you plan on never taking your ipod out of the case, which is difficult when u dock your ipod or use a tunebelt or anything like that, go ahead and get this case.I, however, should have gotten the contour showcase instead."
2,Pay a Little Extra,I have an iPod Photo that I got before the Video came out. I woudl definetly splurge the extra money to get a video. The Photo is clumky and has a very small screen. It is hard to find hardware and accessories for it because they don't make it anymore. I would definetely advise to NOT buy this product. Used ones can be good if they come at a good price. But I would not buy it for full price.
1,Get A CREATIVE ZEN TODAY!!!!!!!,Get A CREATIVE ZEN OTHER THAN THIS STUPID PIECE OF WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Zen has a REPLACEABLE that you don't have send in. Zen lasts twice as long as an iPod. BOO iPod!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Ultimately, recommended","I've encountered quite a few problems using the iPod, in particular in regards to the establishment of a good connection between the computer and the iPod. Sometimes iTunes didn't recognize the iPod (while my computer did identify it) and on other times, the songs download was stopped due to freakish errors. I sort of solved these problems (I hope) by installing the newest versions of iTunes and iPod-updater, switching between several USB slots and some prayer. The iPod works fine once it's loaded with songs, though it really bothers me that it doesn't know how to relate to hebrew song titles, so it ignores them completely (meaning, it shows blanks where the song title should be). Also, a lot of the problems may be resolved, at least temporarily, by resetting the iPod. So, overall I'd recommend it, provided you have the patience to deal with its inevitable quirks and malfunctions (plus it looks really cool...)."
1,not happy,I received the item and was not happy with the product. I contacted Amazon and the customer service rep email the person who sent the item requesting info to return and I have not heard back.
2,I liked it when apple made computers and was into quality,"there are better mp3 players, don't believe the hype. Often the OS freezes causing my battery to drain and requiring me to visit the apple store for repairs."
5,Perfect for a Mac,I use this with my iMac and it works perfectly. The iTunes software does everything for me and it's great. The new one has support for podcasting and photos from digital cameras with iPhoto. It also shows the image of the CD cover if you got the song from the iTunes Music Store (also easy!) I learned how to do everything in seconds! It's great not only for people who know a lot about computer but also for beginners.
3,"New iPod 20GB Color, is it reliable?","The hottest electronic item on the market!!IS NOT RELIABLE.Less than 1 month and the click wheel is faulty. Glad I got Apple Care. This is the 3rd iPod bought in my household, 4th return for service in 8 months- Click wheel twice- Disk drive once- Battery onceSome are lucky, I know 2 iPod ownwers with no problems after 1 year. Think before you roll the dice. Apple Care is a must."
1,Very Bad - Buy Another Brand,"At first these Ipods seem great, but my 40 gb Ipod Photo cost $400 and broke within a year. The touch pad stopped reacting to touch. Also I tunes is really frustrating. Somtimes when you hook the Ipod up, it actually shows up and then you can update it, but usually not. Just look at Ebay to see all the broken Ipods for sale."
1,Kept freezing on me. Couldn't even install,"After hearing about how easy and intuitive an ipod is, I eagerly opened the package and after charging popped the installation CD into my computer. When the PC asked for the Ipod, I connected it. At first it was just the software crashing, then the ipod froze and I couldn't reset it following the instructions in the manual. It was a long frustrating experience. I will be returning this and will buy my player from Sony."
4,Does the job,"I bought this kayak rack as a second rack so I could carry two small (9.5-foot) kayaks on my Honda CR-V. I have a Thule car rack, so everything fit together very well.The first rack that I bought was theThule 835XT Hull-A-Port Rooftop Kayak Carrier. These two models are very similar. The 835XT is a little nicer, but they both carry kayaks the same way. And this model, the 825, is about $40 less expensive.The one other difference between the models is the 825 doesn't come with the two Quickdraw ratching hooks for your rope tie-downs, which were included with the 835XT. These are very helpful to get a nice taut rope when tying the boat to the car, especially in front where you'll have the most wind resitance while driving.Overall, this style of kayak carrier is a great way to go, especially for two kayaks on one vehicle (but remember you'll have to buy two carriers). They're stable, convenient and make it easy to get kayaks on and off your vehicle."
1,Not watched yet,No time to watch Sounder yet. will in winter when I don't want to go out in the cold weather. Good movies that are clean and non-violent are hard to find. Ordered by family member.
3,Disappointing DVD transfer,"This great movie deserves better treatment on DVD. The ""extras"" are worthless, the picture transfer is rather faded and flat, and the movie is presented in ""pan and scan"" format instead of the original widescreen. Dolby Mono.This is a great movie with great music. Can't somebody see their way to giving it the DVD treatment it deserves?On the plus side, it is cheap, and if you love this movie, you can look past these flaws."
5,Great Movie!,"I was surprised to find that many people have not seen this movie. It has always been a family classic for me. It is a great story and right up there with ""Old Yeller"" and ""Where the Red Fern Grows""."
5,a Classic,"a CLASSIC of American Cinema in the golden age of American Cinema. Beautiful perfomances and able to be watched and understood by the whole family - full of thoughts on family, morality, justice, endurance and love."
5,Like A Cold Shower For the Economically Ignorant,"This film summarizes the the plight of Argentina and how a nation as rich as America lost everything to the banks through its governments ignorance, greed and corruption. For anyone unfamiliar with the term ""hyperinflation"" this is the best modern film to outline the effect it has on the society and how corruption and a docile public are the two keys to its development. This is a good preview of America, should we continue our debt based economy!"
4,Love it,"Most people don't get a lot of calcium in their diet and so this supplement is an excellent choice, and also because it is vegetarian gives it a plus. I take it faithfully every day. I would recommend it to every one."
5,Durable and Robust,"I have been wearing this watch for almost two years and I still love it. I wanted a leather fossil watch and when I saw this watch, it matched my profile. This is a automatic watch that with stands all the tough conditions I have placed it through. I was told by my coworkers my watch would not last in that environment (its a good looking watch) but I guess they are eating their words as it is still going strong. I still get the occasional ""I love your watch"" even today from many people. It can be dressed up or down suites many occasions. Don't hesitate, its value for money.......quite durable."
1,Never got it,"I have not received the watch. Still waiting since last February.If you can find out what happened and let me know, I would appreciatePaolo"
4,Swagman XP Hitch Bike Rack,"Looking for a replacement rack that had some security features, since we travel a lot and have many overnights. I like the adjustable cradles, so that the bikes are carried straight. Unfortunately, the hitch bar has adapters so that it can accommodate 1 1/2"" and 2"" receivers, and is attached with a bolt to the receiver, not a lock. Also, the fold-down feature uses two hitch pins, which means it's easy to remove (I replaced one with a lock). Other than that, it's a nice rack."
2,horrible horrible condition!,"I just received these dvds in the mail. And I am very unsatisfied! It looks like something you would rent from the public library. The dvd cases are very badly dented and old. And the dvds themselves are scratched. Its obvious that I received USED dvds. No where on here does it say that they are supposed to be used. In fact, it says ""NEW""!!!!!!!! I want to know what is going on, considering I purchased it from amazon, and not an independent seller. That being said, I give it 2 stars only because the Amanda Show is a great show."
5,awesome dvds,"I just love these dvds they are awesome. I just love watching Amanda , Drake and Josh on these dvds they are all awesome working together."
3,Worked fine,Was easy to use glad I order this item. Hard to find where I live overseas. can't say nothing bad about this item
1,Don't waste your Money,"These flash cards are a waste of money. They ask you questions that are similar to the questions in the back of the book.If you want a quick review try the O'Reilly flash cards, which are true flash cards. They display a term and on the back of the card they explain the terminology. For example one flash card has SLIP on the front and the back of the cards explains SLIP.Please do not waste your time on the Exam Cram Flash cards. The Exam Cram books are much better."
4,GET READY TO SMASH STUFF!!!!!!!!!!,"THE GAMEPLAY: THERE IS LOTS AND LOTS OF EXPLOSIONS. YOU CAN ALSO RUN AROUND AND GO ANY WHERE YOU WANT. YOU CAN ALSO DO WHAT EVER YOU WONT. AND YOU CAN SMASH ALMOST ANYTHING!!!!!!! YOU CAN SMASH AND DESTROY CARS,TANKS,PEOPLE,STREET LIGHTS, AND A LOT MORE STUFF!!!! THE SOUND: MANY EXPLOSINS AND MUSIC COMBINED WITH PEOPLE SCREAMING AND ALSO THE SOUND OF THE HULK ROARING TO AND MORE SOUND. THE GRAPHICS: THE GRAPHICS IN THIS HULK GAME ARE DECENT BUT, NOT BAD. NOW HERE IS THE STUFF ABOUT OTHER STUFF IN THIS GAME......... YOU EARN SMASH POINTS FROM COMPLETEING MISSIONS AND YOU CAN ALSO FIND POINTS TO. YOU USE THE POINTS TO BUY NEW MOVES FOR THE HULK AND THERE IS A LOT OF CHEATS YOU CAN FIND IN THE GAME. THERE IS ALSO A PRACTICE MODE WHERE YOU CAN PRACTICE YOUR NEW MOVES OR JUST PRACTICE. OR IT IS ALSO A GREAT PLACE IF YOU WANT TO SMASH AND DESTROY STUFF WITH OUT COPS AND THE ARMY SHOOTING YOU. PRETTY GOOD GAME I GIVE IT A 8/10. BUY IT."
5,The Hulk The Way The Hulk Should Be!!,"Excellent Game All The Way Through!!! Best Hulk Game Ever Made, Hulk Smash It All! Loads of Fun and Great Graphics!!"
4,a really good overlooked game...,"the only reason i picked this up is because of the ratings posted on the cover, which were 4/5 and 8.9/10 from reputable gaming magazines. otherwise i never heard or saw anything promoting this game, which is a shame because it's one of the better comic book superhero games out there. you should definitely pick it up if you like good games of this genre. the only real downside to this game is sometimes its pretty hard."
5,very very good,LETS PARTY was the greatest book ever. It was very gory and was da bomb! Id really suggest this book to anyone who likes bone chillers. I was shaking when I read this book!! Good one R.L! I just have one warning for anyone who reads this book. DONT EAT ANYTHING BEFORE YOU READ THIS ONE!
3,I thought it would be a good book!,"This book wasn't what I expected.The main character kept switching and it had no point of being called a SUPER CHILLER when there was only one part that was scary. That part wasn't even at the end. I expected more and I hope the next book in the series""In Too Deep"" will be much better than the first book."
3,"Not the best in the Series, but still good","This is an important book in the series, but It isn't as good as the ones that follow."
2,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!,"What was up with this book? Where were all the mass murders that made a Super Chiller Book so promising? I was totally let down with this book. The only reason it didnt get 1 star is because of the violent sequence at the end...save you're money and by ""The Thrill Club"", his best book to date."
2,I thought that this book was going to be great.,"I thought the vampire stuff sucked. I am more into murders and hilucanations. The end should have been different. I thought the book was great up to the ending and the vampire stuff. I'm looking forward to the next one being better. But, I have read better. But don't get me wrong, I love R.L. Stine's books."
1,What?,"The first book in the series was really disappointing. R.L. Stine has written a lot better books. I was excited to find out about this series, but when I first read it, I was wondering why R.L. Stine was even bothering. This book pushes the limit to reality (which he can usually get away with in previous novels) and I don't think I know any ""seniors"" who act the way these ones do. I think they'd be better off as seventh graders graduating to eighth grade."
4,Not Scary Until The End,"This isn't the kind of book that has terror on every page. The beginning and middle are pretty boring. A few chapters are really interesting, but it doesn't get scary until the ending. Don't read this book just for the ending. Read this book if you plan to read the other Seniors books, which are much more scary."
3,"It was okay, not the best","Lets party is the first book in the fear street seniors series. The whole series is about Trisha's(one of the characters)vision of all the seniors lying in coffins. Lets party is by far the grossest in the twelve book series. Its about Josie, the main character in this book,and how she does a doom spell on her teacher because he gave her a bad grade even when she did extra credit. It comes true though, and her teacher dies in a bad car accident. Now she's really scared because she did another doom spell on Marla Newman, a snob. Then the next day, theres a party @ Trish'a mansion. They play a murder game and marla newman ends up being ""dead"". Its all a joke but all of a sudden a creature comes in and murders all the seniors except Josie, and she has to find outn a way to turn back time to not make that happen, she does and everybody is saved....the end."
3,this is a party?,"R.L. STINE BROKE OFF OF HIS USUAL CHILDREN HORROR STORIES AND ATTEMPTED TO WRITE A SERIES FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS. THIS BOOK BEGINS THE SENIORS SERIES. IT LEADS OFF WITH A END OF JUNIOR YEAR PARTY. THE HOST OF THE PARTY HAS A VISION AND SHE SEES ALL THE SENIORS LAYING IN COFFINS. THE STUDENTS DON'T BELIEVE HER, BUT THEN JOSIE CASTS A SPELL THAT KILLS HER TEACHER, AND EVENTUALLY, A SCENE ARAISES WHERE THE STUDENTS MIGHT JUST END UP THE COFFINS. IS THERE A WAY FOR JOSIE TO RIGHT ALL THE WRONG SHE DID? OR IS THE SENIOR CLASS DOOMED?THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS SERIES AND HIS OTHERS IS THAT THIS IS ONE IS WRITTEN FOR A MORE MATURE GROUP, NOT OLDER TEENS, BUT EARLY HIGHSCHOOLER MIGHT ENJOY THIS SERIES."
1,Tries too hard to be cheap,"This is a discount video, like the $5.00 selections you find at Wal-Mart. Sometimes they play, sometimes they don't. And when the video is a dud (like mine was) It's not worth the expense to return it. It took several dozen attempts to start it up twice, and each time it wouldn't display a menu. And failed to play beyond chap 4 of the first episode. I'll probably order the standard edition of ""Love Affair"", but I'm unlikely to find a separate 1934 edition of Jane Eyre, which is one of my favorites. Yes, I'm going to look on Amazon.This disc was factory sealed new, and had machine circular scratches. (one for the shredder)"
4,Just what I wanted.,"The book is easy to read, and it has some real-life tales of shoot-outs and all that started them and ended them. It adds depth to the writing I am doing."
5,Uniqueness of Jesus,"The Bible study entitled, ""The Uniqueness of Jesus,"" is a very effective introduction to the Christian faith. Focusing on Jesus, the study clearly shows the unique characteristics of Jesus as compared to other famous religious leaders. This is a foil for some great discussion and development of greater understanding."
2,OMG CRAPOLA!!,Man I was so disapointed with this purchase I felt like getting fat on chocolate! It fails to say in the description that it's made of super thin metal almost like tin foil and the case vibrates like no ones business with the fans are running. I have three in there cuz you really need them to get the air flowing. When the computer is running its so noisey and vibrates so much I am surprised it dont fly right off my table.. You would almost be better getting a plastic one. It's HUGE so make sure that you really need a full tower. It was my first FULL size and had no idea it would be so big. The plasic side is kinda chinsy though. But all the bays are nice to have.
3,Modest Return For The Price,"Not a bad reproduction, but hardly the half-scale suggested in the item description. The team emblem is a decal that is slightly disproportionate to the helmet, and the level of detail does not justify the price. All in all, I'm reasonably happy with the purchase, but I won't buy any others."
1,Don't bother ordering here,"Twice this item arrived damaged. Also, in both cases the cardinal on the helmet is uneven and disproportionate to the rest of the helmet. I didn't discover the damage on the replacement until after it had been autographed. Amazon refused to issue a refund. I highly recommend purchasing somewhere more reputable like [...]. It may cost you a little more, but at least you will receive a quality item."
1,Caveat emptor,Assembly is an absolute joke and the product despite the 100+ pieces and terrible directions is not worth the cost. If it had been assembled it still would have been a disappointment. Granted I am not a carpenter I guess if I was I would have made it myself in the first place and saved 70 dollars and a lot of time. If you buy it and find assembly a breeze please respond and I will retract this and come to the realization that I do indeed have a very limited ability to do even simple tasks.
1,Many inconsistencies with the Regency period,"Perhaps this story would work a little better in a historic period that the author was more familiar with. The manners and attitudes of the characters are impulsive and careless, not like behaviors in the early 1800s. The motives of the characters seem a bit random, or, at least, poorly explained. I stopped reading when the author has one of the characters propose the use of a welding torch... at this point in history, any welding activities required a blacksmith and a forge. This was the last straw in an unconvincing book. A waste of money and time."
2,Aunt Sophie's Diamonds,"Joan Smith has written several amazingly fun and witty books. This is not the best of them. The ""witty"" dialogue is sometimes overdone, coming across as tedious rather than delightful. There are occasions, of course, when the dialogue shines. But it is not consistent. In addition, though the romance in Smith's books is often subtle and understated, in this book, it was understated practically to the point of non-existence. The heroine goes from tongue tied in the hero's presence to amazingly bold and witty, all in the space of a few hours and for no apparent reason. As for the hero, it seems to be some species of love at first word...The back story of the diamonds is rather obvious from the beginning, but there are some nice capers while one waits for the characters to catch on. If you're a fan of Joan Smith, by all means, read it, but I'd advising checking it out from the library rather than buying it."
4,Nice Archeologcal Introduction,Brings to the fore how technology maybe isn't all that far ahead of the ancient builders. Nicely illustrated and an easy read in summary form serves as a good reference. Only fault is a more comprehensive analysis of techniques would have been more appreciated by this carpenter.
2,Crappy air conditioner/heater,"My husband & I bought this air conditioner from Lowe's last year. The electronic display stopped responding (i.e. changing temp., turning off) within a month. Lowe's replaced it after much argument (since they installed it they didn't want to return it they wanted us to go through warranty even though their return policy is 90 days) with the same unit. Now it's been a year since we replaced it and obviously the warranty period is over and our replacement unit is doing the same thing except now it first got itself stuck at 90 degrees. Sure glad these things always break in the july/august heat. My husband loves electronics and remotes but I gotta say I think less electronic fancy units probably don't break as much. :("
3,BEWARE!! This is not the deluxe model. Price on box 15.99!!,"I thought that everyone interested in this toy should realize that it is not the deluxe model with scanner and extra food. It comes with a hamburger, buns, pickles, play money and 3 play coins. I bought this as a last minute gift for my grandchildren for $35.35 from Saimra not In Stock Toys. I don't get out to shop much since I have MS and bought most of my Christmas presents online. The picture is fuzzy and the description is vaque so one cannot really tell what all comes with the set but I just assumed since all the others had more accessories that this one did too. I was shocked when I received it and imprinted on the box was the price of 15.99 and it was not the model I thought I was getting. I couldn't send it back, it was too late. The cash drawer sticks once in a while too but my 3 year old grandson likes it. I just wanted to warn others about this."
4,Almost as good as the originals,"The original Lifa baselayers were extremely tough and effective. I still have many of the first that I bought in the 80's. Yes, I have used them every winter and part of the summer since then. The only reason for buying more is damage from abrasion from leg movement and arm swing. The new Helly Hansen is softer and thicker than the originals. Softness was never a complaint for me. The thicker mesh of the new model does not vent as well, but still does a fine job of wicking moisture. My main complaint is the new waist band. The elastic tends to roll and twist. The old style never had that problem."
5,Great chain--great value,"Originally bought this chain in April 2013, and put about 2800 miles on it before it needed replacement (for wear). During those 22 months, most rides were about 20-25 miles on clean roads, but did include a few metric-century rides and half-iron distance races. I replaced it with the same chain. Appears to be just as good as the ""big name"" chain--it never broke on me--but easier to mount/dismount with the ""quick link"" than the one-use ""break off"" chain pin. The quick link (one comes with the chain and should last for the life of the chain) is very helpful for those who take chains off the bike regularly for cleaning (e.g., ultrasonic). Very quiet in operation. Already lubed by the manufacturer, but not too much (no mess when mounting the first time).Bought this chain upon recommendation from a friend who is a Cat 3 cyclist (road and cyclocross)."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this kit expecting a yoga workout, with the accessories to go with it. What I got was a ""Yoga-Pilates"" video that lasted about 15 minutes and I never even felt warmed up (it was not stated in any description for the product that it was Yoga and Pilates). Also, I'm 5'8"" and the ball is too small for me. I was disappointed to find that this kit came with a VHS tape, who even uses VHS anymore? It certainly doesn't feel like I got my money's worth."
2,Almost...but not quite,"This book is a good read--interesting, informative, educational, and funny. My biggest problem with it, however, is that it is too narrowly focused. There was way too much emphasis put on this concept of ""texturizing the hair"". All of the styles in the book assumed you would have a texturizer and all of the photographs (every single one) were of the author herself (By the way, she never mentioned whether her hair was texturized or not). It would have been very helpful to see the hairstyles discussed on OTHER women, with other textures and lengths of hair."
5,A Hair Saviour - In print!!,"Thank you Lonnice for ""telling it as it is"". I enjoyed your book so much I told my friends overseas about it. Now they want the book. Your stories of hair problems growing up are identical to mine. It made me laugh so much. I've only just started on the program and I look forward to the day my hair will be as oustanding as yours! I wish you had a web page where we can ask direct questions. Like how can we effectively set our hair under 1 hour using those ""U"" prongs???. Anyay, thanks so much. You've made the difference in my hair!!"
5,"Is there such a thing as a ""Hair Bible""? There is now.","This book changed my life. After trying to go natural for about 7 or 8 years, this book finally answered every last one of my questions and even a few extras. I have Mrs. Bonner to thank for a head full of natural hair. It has been a little over 2 years, and times do get hard, but this book has given me a multitude of options besides chemicals. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH. - 22 BF"
1,It's not worth it!,"I bought this book. If you are looking for information to help you take care of YOUR hair, this book will NOT provide it. This VERY short book is really the story of her personal journey. If you don't have the same texture of hair (or can't get the texturizer upon which the few ""styles"" that she talks about are based) then this book is decidedly unhelpful."
3,Don't Texturize your hair!,"I read this book back in the mid nineties. At that time I hadlong, shoulder length natural hair and I have type 4a/b hair. (That'sthe kinkiest ie. Macy Gray type on Andre Walker's hair chart) Thisbook made me feel like my natural hair was not versatile enough to dothose styles so I went out and got a ""mild"" texturizer. Boyoh boy did I regret that. Well to make a long story short eventuallymy hair broke off. Today I have shoulder length kinky, nappy allnatural hair and I wear my hair in all types of styles (when I feellike combing it :-)) and it looks better than the pics in the book,yes better. Don't be fooled your natural hair is extremelyversatile. .... END"
2,Not at all what I expected,"The book gets into her journey for going natural but usuing a texturizer. Well, for some of us texturizing does not work. It only took mere minutes for texturizer to straighten my hair. It did help with later getting the U-prong rollers that helps to create other styles for me now."
4,Hair Bible,"This book is perfect for all the black women who has gone through the hell of having to straighten her hair. I followed the advice in this book, and my hair has grown longer than it has ever been in my life. Black women, break away from the slavery of relaxed hair!"
4,Great Starter Book,"I read this book right before I big chopped in December 2007. I had been transitioning for about 6 months and I was tired of working with two textures. A coworker, who was already natural, let me borrow this book. I related to the stories and was encouraged by her example. I came away feeling confident in my ability to take care of the tightly coiled hair that God gave me. 4 years later, my hair is down my back when straightened. I would recommend if you are thinking about going natural."
3,A Great Start,"Bonner's book was where I started on the journey to a more natural style. She's got some great suggestions as far as how to detangle, what kinds of products to use, and fun styles for texturized hair. TEXTURIZED: find a different guide if you intend to go all natural. A virtue of Good Hair that I really appreciated were the anecdotes that I can relate to as a young woman who left home and left 18 years of braids - which my mama maintained - behind and had no idea how to care for my hair. I needed to hear that the hair God gave me will be beautiful if I'll respect it and to see beautiful examples of African hair AND have someone tell me how to make those looks happen. So she's a proponent of texturing which isn't 100% natural. The woman has some good kitchen table advice for those of us who are embarking on the journey to beautiful balck hair."
2,A beginning but certainly not enough ......,"I enjoyed this short book with all the anectdotes about the author's hair problems but, and this is a big but, it fell far short of actually helping the average black woman. Sure there are plenty of style tips if you can figure out what she means by 'getting a texturizer'. I still have no idea of the best way to proceed in this arena and the author provides absolutely no info about this but yet all her hairstyle assume you can get one or you hair naturally has the same texture as being 'texturized'.So ladies don't think this book can be used on it's own, you definitely need other resources."
2,Not quite the book for everyone,"I was disappointed by this book. When I wore my hair natural (with absolutely no hint of texturizer), I found it difficult to duplicate many of the styles featured in this book. If you have truly kinky, afro-textured hair and prefer NOT to wear a comb-through hair texturizer (texturizers are made up of chemicals, by the way), I'd look elsewhere for hair care tips."
3,Provided A Few Nice Styles,"I picked this book up from the local library. It was a very quick read. The title mentions chemicals becoming too rough on the hair, but the author herself is using a texturizer on her hair. A texturizer IS STILL a chemical. Consider the difference between putting your hand in fire for just a few seconds versus a few minutes. The former is a texturizer. The latter is a relaxer.I have nothing against the author using chemicals on her hair, it's the presentation of the book as hair care for natural hair that I have a problem with. I do enjoy the author taking us along for her lifelong personal journey with her hair and providing personal photos to show her metamorphisis. She also does a great job of going into details about hair care, products and styling."
2,Not really sure who this book is for....,"I got this text as a possible core reader for an undergraduate course, and I found it to be two things that I don't care for in a textbook: long-winded and overly technical. I get that the topics covered can get very cerebral and abstract, but one catches more intellectual flies with engaging prose, not this ""I'm the smartest guy in the room"" writing style.I've taken grad courses in theology and religious studies, and I don't know an instructor who would willingly go with a text like this. It has good ambitions, but the delivery isn't on target. It's too dense, for undergrads in an intro course, too broad for grad students in religious studies or theology, and too technical for a general audience: who is it for?"
2,mediocre at best,"very jumpy read-out, base magnet is not overyly powerful but seems adequate, would not recommend as a primary test device"
5,Wonderful Movie,"Honestly, I am not usually into feel-good Christmas movies but this one is WONDERFUL! I have actually tried to buy the movie for the last couple of years and have finally found a way to order it (hopefully they're not ""out of stock""). It's not a typical Christmas movie - it can be seen any time throughout the year. It's so fantastic and so ""real"" that you can't help but wonder why this was a made-for-Lifetime TV movie and not on the big screen. Watch it, it's a treasure!"
5,If You Believe,"This is a wonderful Christmas movie about a woman Suzan Walker) who is down about life in general until she is paid a visit by herself as a young girl. She works as a big-city book editor and she hasn't landed a great author for some time so she takes it out on her staff. Even her brother and his family have given up on her when she insists that Santa Claus is a silly notion. The young Suzie enters the picture and begins to haunt Susan into experiencing the joys and feelings she long buried over the years. She meets Thom Weller, a prolific writer with talent and one she has dreamed about and with the help of little Suzie love begins to bloom."
3,The Usual Holiday Feel-Good Movie,"The main program is about a modern day 'scrooge' who is as hard as a rock and cannot for the life of her enjoy one moment of the holidy season. Then along comes a magical 'angel' who begins to peel off the layers of this woman's steel. The movie is obviously predictable from beginning to end, but for those looking to receive a light 'light-hearted' feeling, they get what they are looking for.I don't mind 'feel-good' movies, holiday or otherwise; but I just could not get into these characters. Once in awhile I get that warm feeling, then one of the main characters zaps it away. Aside from the movie, you also get a Biographies section for Ally Walker and Hayden Panettiere. Films, awards, and various other achievements are listed for these two actresses."
5,Great fun!,"I love to watch the Christmas movies and specials. I frequently record them to watch at a later time. I re-use the tapes after I watch the shows. But I didn't re-use the tape from 'If You Believe'. Even my grown sons enjoyed this movie. It seems to capture the essence of the reality that we only have one life, and we miss out if we live only for the grind of work and responsibilities. Every time I watch 'If You Believe', it helps me remember to stay in touch with my more idealistic self, the 'crusader' from my earlier days. It's a good lesson at Christmas, and any time of year."
5,THIS IS SO VERY ENJOYABLE!!,"While navigating the road to success and fortune, book editor Susan Stone (Ally Walker) has become cynical and jaded, abandoning the youthful idealism and enthusiasm which propelled her forward in the first place. As a result, Susan has lost her personal and professional momentum, and is in danger of losing not only her job but also the love of her family. All this changes when a strange but adorable seven-year-old girl named Suzie (Hayden Panettiere) enters Susan's life, apparently with the express purpose of jolting the heroine back to humanity - and guiding her toward the true love of her life. It may not be difficult to guess from the outset whom the ebullient ""Suzie"" really is. A typical but nonetheless enjoyable Christmas-season offering"
4,Princess of the Desert,"Cecile Villier was a daughter of France but a child of the desert. Born to a rich Frenchman and a Bedouin beauty, the lovely woman found no comfort in the immense wealth of Parisian society. Intent on finding a home to call her own, she returned to her mother's birthplace: the Sahara. There she found freedom in a new way of life-and the most captivating man she'd ever seen. Matthew Blackmoore had become one with the desert and its people. To Cecile, the dashing young Englishman embodied this strange place: He blazed with passion, and in the horseman's embrace she knew she risked destruction. But the oasis of his kiss proved a haven from the dangers of the fierce wilderness, and the resourceful beauty was determined to make both the man-and the land-her own."
5,Very nice!,"I love this extract. Good flavor, not too overpowering. I use it in proten shakes that need a little extra 'something.' Will buy it again."
4,Versatile towing rack,"I've had this rack for since 2002 - has worked well for carrying bikes whether towing my +2000-lbs popup camper or not. I've recommended it to friends, and would buy it again.Don't use the swing-down feature often, as it's pretty heavy if bikes are loaded. The v-cradles for the bikes don't work as well for the oval tubes on some bikes - especially for really ""tall"" top tubes. I bought a ""cheater"" tube for adapting troublesome bikes (ladies frame, etc.) to fit the rack.The three screws to fasten the top plate are a little tedious, but I can clamp it as tight as I want, can accomodate top tubes of varous diameters (the top plate flexes), and I have never seen them loosen even after several hours of highway driving.Re: earlier comments on chains: I tow with a minivan (towing package including load-leveling). I had to get safety chain extensions so I could tow my popup camper. To kee the chains off the road, I use a bungee cord from the crossing point to the trailer tongue."
2,pivot lock broke. too long to tow tent trailer.,"We really liked that this rack locked to the car, and locked the bikes. However, the pivot lock that allows it to swing down so you can get into the back of the minivan/SUV broke, so it no longer swings down. We've only had it a year or so. Also, the main reason we bought this was to carry 4 bikes and then pull the tent trailer from that, and the design is all wrong. It's too long. We tried to pull our light tent trailer, and unless you're a monster truck (we've got a minivan), the safety chains don't have enough slack and got ripped off when driving--there's not enough arch available under the car for the chain, due to the length of the chain needed... (maybe if they had welded loops for the safety chain to the end of the extended hitch [if that's legal])..."
3,sturdy- but needs improvement,"Easy to assemble, and sturdy. the hitch pin provided is good in that it is threaded and the carrier is threaded as well. tightening is accomplished by the end of the hitch pin, but the tiny pin provided is pathetic. I ordered the swagman locking pin also, luckily, and the locking part of the pin - the cap- fits over the standard one, making it locking as well as being able to be tightened. I cannot imagine what would happen if the standard pin loosens on the road with nothing more than the tiny clip provided to retain it.Over all good, but order the locking pin too, you'll need it."
3,1st time Bike Rack owner,"Keep in mind I am a first time owner of a rack. I found this rack diffcult to install and the instructions were very poor. The diagrams did not match the unit I received, 4 holes vs. 3 in the actual unit. There was no explanation of how to fold it down to gain access to the trunk. I replaced the hitch pin right away as it seem very easily loosen with no good way to secure it.It did seem to hold the bikes on ok I didn't feel secure going on long trips till i replaced the hitch pin.Maybe I was expecting too much but poor instructions always make for a bad first impression in my case."
1,Dissappointed,"We ordered this rack to put behind our fifth wheel camper because the advertising online implied such (other products said NOT to use behind 5th wheel campers). The first time we used it the vertical shaft bent. As we examined the product... we noticed a small tag indicating Not to use behind 5th wheel. Yah, we should have noticed this at installation, but didn't. So we did not return and my husband is going to try to weld a reinforcement bar so that we can use it."
4,Gloria,"I found this book to be very interesting. I did not read the first two books in the trilogy but had no trouble following this book. I think it was an interesting story, combining fiction with a historical character. The way Chamberlin describes La Pucelle througout the book keeps you wanting to read more of the story."
5,Perfect Fit,"I was leery about how this jacket was going to fit, I hardly ever order clothing online, because the fit never seems to be right, but when I received my jacket, I was totally amazed and excited. The fit was perfect. I am 6' tall and the sleeves are just right in length. I'm so excited, I can hardly wait for winter. This has been my best clothing buy ever. Size is true to fit."
1,OOOPS! Not what it looks like!,"The images on this ""box"" are easy to misread! NOT the beautiful, painstaking, stop-motion art work so patiently and lovingly crafted.It is a musical rock n roll ode to Wind in the Willows sorta Spinal Tap"
1,OMG! Not At All What You Might Think,No characters in costume. No animation. Only a bunch of very sad middle aged musicians performing very badly. I'm very sorry I bought this.
1,a 13 yr. old with a cell phone camera could've done better,"""Forbidden Knowledge"".... a joke,period.Presented authors who were not there,audio gave 2 words out of 4,could not see what the speakers were showing on the screen,played ""stupid"" music LOUDLY while people were talking, and gave no answers at all.A stupid,stupid joke."
2,What a waste,"I got this DVD along with the Secret of the Serpent DVD...both equally good information with a really really bad background music. The music was so poorly put together, was so loud and very poor choice of music that I did not want to watch anymore. Do your consumer a favor and either let them know that the background music may be disturbing to their nervous system or take it out all together."
1,Abysmally poor sound production,"What might have been interesting lectures and power-point presentations are absolutely sabotaged by having the camera/sound recorder at the back of a lecture hall caputuring the ambient sound of amplified voices. For whatever reason, the microphones were not tied into the recording, so what you get is a dismally low grade recording of amplified voices as they are dispersed throughout the hall. Then, to compound that problem, an insipid ""new age"" vocal soundtrack has been laid over the lectures rendering them essentially inaudible. I wholeheartedly agree with every reviewer who lambasted this DVD for it's amateurish, defective and inexcusably crummy production values."
1,Poor DVD quality,I would not even give this a rating of 1 star for I could not even watch the DVD that was sent to me it was of such poor quality.....I am disgusted with the amount of money that I have wasted on such an item...And would not recommend it to anyone.
3,Attend the Conference and Decide for Yourself,"This DVD is a chance for those interested in the paranormal, secret societies, UFOs and such to travel to a conference and hear from many experts in the field, with live interviews and lectures from Gardiner's Forbidden Knowledge UK 06 event. Includes music by Reality Films favorite, Soul Path."
2,Sound quality,The sound quality was poor. Music was added throughout the program. The music was pleasant but made it very difficult to hear the speeches. I wish I could have made out enough to know if the subjects were well covered.
1,Very poor quality production.,"Horrendous sound quality with annoying background music makes this DVD almost unintelligible. Amatuerish, low quality production of probably interesting speakers, echoing blandly in a large room. I only hope I can get a refund for this money-waster."
3,Questions and Answers with the best of them,"Standard documentary quality. Good montage sequence in the beginning introducing you to the key players in the conference. The music on during the question and answer portion was a little loud, but okay. Secret society information was interesting and well explained by Gardiner. Worth your time to view."
5,Loved It,"I saw the original TV series in Iran and subsequently read the book in original Persian. Needless to say, I enjoyed them both very much. I came across this book while browsing Amazon, immediately ordered it and finished reading it within days of its arrival. The translator has done a great job in translating this book and conveying the little Persian jokes and situations which make this book a masterpiece in Persian. I felt that for the most part (90%) the original LAUGH FACTOR had successfully been translated. Enjoy it."
3,Nice Disney syle fare,"I remember enjoying watching this on the Wonderful World of Disney as a child. A ""boy meets dog, loses grandfather, finds new family"" formula film. A couple of sad/scary moments, nicely smoothed over by the sudden appearance of a parent/adult to explain things.A pleasant, if bland depiction of Flanders in 1900. Worth watching to see scenes of Antwerp in 1959 where it was filmed.Out of print I believe, but I found it in a bargain bin at ""X""mart."
4,Flavor of Flanders,"As an old man who still likes children's stories, I was surprised to find that the best part was the local color -- the countryside, windmill, dress, language, accent, architecture, and art. My wife remarks that the movie is centered on the boy, not the dog (contrast Lassie). It is well enough done, though limited by the technique of the time. But I'm still no fan of Rubens -- I'll take Rembrandt.By the way, don't miss the point that the egotistical artist who carried on about devotion to his art, had to learn elementary humanity from a boy!"
5,Touching film,"This was the best film that I saw in 1999. It was heartwarming and touching, and in all in all, a great family movie that people of all ages and all types, especially animal/dog lovers, will enjoy. It's a must see!"
4,Have fun with this,"Fun, if a little schmaltzy. Watch it with the kids. You've seen this dog before - in OLD YELLER."
1,TRY THE REMAKE INSTEAD,I HERE THAT THISMOVIE WAS GOOD SO I RENTED IT. I HATEDIT THEMOVIEIS DULL AND NOT HEARTWARMING. ... THE 1999 REMAKE ISMUCH BETTER JESSE JAMES AND JEMERY JAMES KITCHER MAKE MUCH BETTER NELLOS THAN DAVD LADD. PLUS THE DOGTHE USE IN HERE IS NOT EVEN THE WRITE BREED.
5,A little tearjerker,"I first saw this wonderful film in the 1970's and cried all the way through it. A young boy named Nello and his grandfather live a very poor life, and when they find a wounded dog take him in and keep him. When the grandfather dies (more tears! ) Nello and dog have to learn ""how to live"". Nello's idol is the painter Reubens, but he does not have any money to study so he is befriended by an artist, who helps to realise his dream.This is the most heartwarming film which will make you feel very humble."
5,Impeccable Remastering of Classic Children's Film !,"I had the old Paramount VHS version of this great classic 1959 film, but it was pan-and-scan with a rather washed-out picture. The first DVD version was an improvement but still utilized the pan-and-scan full screen treatment. However this new DVD blows both out of the water ! The film looks brand new and includes the Fox trade-mark logo. How wonderful to finally view this heart-warming story in the original wide-screen format...there's just no comparison. Full marks to the producers of this re-issue ! But make sure you get the blue case (wide-screen) and NOT the purple case (pan-and-scan). Note this DVD is recorded in mono and NOT the original stereo..."
4,good play,I was in the theater and I saw that playI would like a relation of plays in DVD that you haveI am going to buy them
1,Bag Lady to the Stars,"All the power to Mr. Wright. After all, it 's not everyone that can hit a home run on Broadway. God bless him. And it is a fascinating little story, of a transsexual in drag who outwits the German Gestapo and the Stasi, living finally to triumph as a post-modern icon of perverse longevity in a land of forgotten heroes, mysterious deaths and torture chambers. One would love to know the true story of this so-called 'survivor.' Whose lap was she/he sitting on? The play itself is a long drag, a monologue delivered to the audience about how fascinating the playwright found this person to be. Of course, one would very much wonder how the playwright decided that what was most interesting about this story was the fact that he found it so terribly interesting. Another interpretation might have been that there wasn't very much there in the first place."
4,suite life,"great movie ,didn't no it was only three episodes wish that was stated lol mint disc no scratches and disc case was great thank you"
1,Great Show: But Lousy DVD,"Here I Am In Your Life,It's about time Disney decided to release a TSL DVD. The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is a great show but am disturbed with the type of DVD release. I would prefer a season release with all 26 episodes on DVD like the Lizzie McGuire Vol. 1 boxed set which had first 22 episodes of that show.Theme DVDs are terrible. What a ripoff. I am not buying this DVD. It's a waste of money. I'd rather buy all the episodes off iTunes Music Store which has most of season 1 already and some of season 2.This DVD only has 1 episode of season 1 and like 2 episodes from season 2 -- with one being a never before seen episode. I don't care if its never been seen before. I think I'll wait for the episode to air instead of buying a terrible DVD.Great show bad DVD. Disney why don't you get it together. Pull yourself together and give fans what they really want a season DVD."
1,Suite Life,Advertised as never seen before only to order and find that my daughter recently saw this on the Disney Channel. Waste of money as far as I'm concerned.
5,Verry Funny,"The Suite Life is the best show on the Disney Channel. It is not like all of the other trash on today. I think that if you are thinking about buying your child, or family kid members a present, they would want this. Even if they had never heard of it. I got on to it really quick on the first episode. So I hope you ejoy the show! And have a great day!!"
2,LOL At least you won't be watching too long...2.3 stars.,"..Cause this series is a terrible downer. The jokes are rarely funny and the show consists of shallowly-attractive celebrities who are rich somewhat spoiled and get their way nearly every time. None of them act that well, and London is the most spoiled, terrible actress that Disney has ever spat out at us. I totally despise her stupid, ditzy air-headed persona. It makes me sick, how stupid she has to act to get 10 year olds to laugh.I didn't like the program when it first arrived on the Disney Channel over two and a half years ago, and I grew to loathe it, episode after episode after episode.Watch Lizzy McGuire, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, or The Proud Family; they're much better, well-rounded Disney programs.Cover Art: CDialogue: D+Characters: C+Length: C-Overall: D+2.3 stars."
5,CAN'T MISS IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This show is the best on Disney Channel it is so halarious! It is so funny I could watch it all day long! This also includes a never before seen episode with Jesse Mcartney in it! Just sit back and relax while watching 4 halarious episodes of the suite life! Live the suite life with Zack and Cody! Also live the suite life with all the stars:Dylan sprouseCole sprousePhill lewisAshley Tisdalebrenda songKim rodesYou have gotta own this dvd because it's so big of a block buster! This show is so halarious! you go to channel 29 and watch it every day at 6:30 5:30 central!Oh yeah find this review helpful and get the dvd!
1,My Mistake!,"Would you believe I purchased this and it's the American DVD version!!! Duh!!! Silly me, my kids gave Santa a hard time for getting them confused with an American family. Will remember the next time!"
2,Gross!,Why would anyone want to put such a horrible show on DVD? Cheesy jokes and poor acting by the cast!! Though Ashley tisdale is REALLY REALLY hot!
4,Heavy rock from Norway with some progressive leanings,"Norwegian Aunt Marys second album is better than their debut but still all their pieces arent in their right places. This is still very solid heavy rock with progressive hints, and also some ballads thrown in too. But it was still a bit obvious that Aunt Mary were searching for their true musical direction. The heavy tracks and its guitar riffs lingers on a bit from time to time like in ""Joinin' the crowd"", but the contrast between louder songs and more lyrical ones like ""Delight"" are succesfull and indeed very needable. The long track ""Blowin' Tiffany"" gives some promises of what the future had in sight, with its more complec structure. Still, this is a good album in its own way and no one can argue with the tough riffs in a track like ""G Flat road""."
5,Good and worth the money,"This monitor has the best value in the class of 1600 x 1200. The pixels are sharp. I have no complain when using photoshop. And it is very bright.However, 25 ms is not fast enough. When I open the Performance tab of Task Manager (Windows) and drag around, I can see the ugly latency. Yes, this problem exists on all LCD, more or less. I just have to remind potential buyers anyway.Some people suggest using DVI instead of VGA for better quality. I agree. I happen to lack the resource to buy such video card, and VGA plug works well enough for me. So if you don't have a DVI card, don't shy away from this monitor.You can also rotate the monitor 90 degrees for portrait mode. It is great for viewing PDF or word doc (support from video card required). But you don't have to if you wish to use landscape mode."
4,"beautiful, but dead pixels","A beautiful monitor, but mine came with some dead pixels. Must use DVI inputs for best picture quality."
5,Great monitor at a great price,"We use this monitor where I work in a software engineering environment. We stare at these monitors up to ten hours a day looking at source code and other text based displays. This is one of the best monitors I've ever used regardless of price. When I saw the price for this monitor on Amazon, I bought one for my own use at home. At home I use the monitor for programming and for gaming. It's performance is excellent in both realms. I don't know if the color reproduction is photo quality, but it looks good to me and that's all that matters as far as I'm concerned."
4,Swagman 5 bike,"Very well constructed of solid materials, works great, would buy again. Directions are poor, Amazon.com and [...] pictures are both off, but Swagman's are fairly close. [...]"
5,How could it be improved? It can't,"I have owned 2 bike racks. One was not worth anything, the other was difficult to use. This is the perfect rack.1) Five bikes, few others do this.2) The cradles are adjustable on angle with initial setup. This is the definitive factor! If you've never used a rack try to put bikes of different size and style if you don't have this feature. Just try...3) The cradles are well designed, padded great, and can accommodate a large range of frame.4) It folds down which is huge if you use a locking pin.This is one of the best designed products I have used in a long time."
4,Big improvement over my last bike rack,"This bike rack is much easier to use than the last one I had. I have 3 kids so loading and unloading was more of a workout than the actual bike rides! This has made it much easier and is also more secure with the built in lock. The only drawback is the need to buy bar adapters for children's and women's bikes, but it is worth it!"
2,Poor quality control,"I was so excited about the reviews here, that I ordered this rack. However the assembly is/was a nightmare. The nuts don't fit on the bolts (they screw on part way and then stop). It took me an hour to muscle (and I mean this was hard) 3 nuts on the bolts. Then the 1/2"" pin does not fit through the hole (to keep the rack upright). Just doesn't fit. Nothing I can do but wait to call them about it. VERY frustrating! How can they send parts that don't fit together?"
4,very good,"Well done, better than the Joan Mitchell I liked it as much as ""Artiist on Art"". I would reccomend it."
3,"It's Pretty Good, but Definitely Needs a Good Instructor to Supplement It","This is a fairly good, concise analysis of numerical linear algebra. It covers topics in a logical manner and overall has fairly good explanations. However, I feel that it has a few notable shortcomings.Although explanations are fairly good, I found that they were too short. A minimum amount of detail is given, and there are very few examples. Also, there are very few end-of-chapter problems, and the ones given are almost all quite difficult and there are no answers available.For these reasons I would only recommend this book for people with a strong background in linear algebra. I was an engineering undergraduate with a limited knowledge of linear algebra when I read it, but an upper-year math major or a math graduate would probably find this book to be ok, as long as their course instructor gives many supplementary resources, such as practice problems."
5,My respectful gratitude to Dr Maitra,"This is, by far, the most outstanding primer to introduce the intricacies of Sri Aurobindo's insights to mainstream academicians in their language. Lucidity and brevity are the hallmarks of this philosophical commentary. Many find it easy to nurse the notion that western philosophy doesn't hold much value before the Integral Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. On the contrary, Dr Maitra delineates the elements of the western thought precisely to emphasize how essential it is, in order to decipher the voluminous writings of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother."
2,"ok for playing music, games not a high power pc at all","I bought this pc to replace an e machines t 3085 that had a damaged motherboard. at first it seemed to be better and i have owned earlier compaqs that i loved. I have since repaired the t3085 and have them running side by side( I broke it to begin with not the fault of the manufacturer.) there is no comparison!!!the e machines is faster smoother and has no problem burning discs, playing games, and in short doing all of the tasks that you would expect to be able to do.the compaq features a faster burner but it will fail to burna dvd -r 1/3rd of the time while the emachines has yet to failonce in the same time frame.prices are similar and compaq does not seem to be the same quality name they once were. i would not buy one again!"
2,5 Stars for Ideas -- 0 Stars for Safety consideration,"This books contains wonderfully creative ideas.However, some of the ""tools"" Kuffner suggests you work with should only be given to a toddler under close supervision or not at all. There are comprehensive lists of everyday household items to let the toddler play with, and some of them are big NO NOs; i.e. bottle caps, buttons, bubble wrap. The bottle caps must be large enough so a toddler cannot get it in his/her mouth and the same for the buttons. Very few buttons are made that large. Bubble wrap could be fun for an older child, but it's kind of like playing with your puppy with a shoe. What happens when you are not around? The puppy often gets the shoe and destroys it. Bubble wrap could be a choking hazard. Those are just examples from the letter ""B"" that she has listed. This may all be common sense to most people, but if not, the possible consequences could be deadly.I think the book should be reworked with an eye for safety and then it is ok."
1,Lame,"It just was a lame book. I thought it would help and be great but I only used one thing. That was a song about marching soldiers. The ""crafts"" are things old ladies can do, but no toddler boy would want to sit around and make crafts."
2,Not very imaginative,"If you have no imagination whatsoever, you will probably get a lot out of this book."
1,this author must have been desperate to meet her deadline,"This book really sucks. All of the other 1-star reviewers are right: this woman has no imagination. It doesn't take a genius--or a person with a borderline retarded IQ, for that matter--to come up with the majority of these ""ideas."" If you have any memory of once being a child yourself then you can come up with these activities on your own. My kid already knows how to do the obvious stuff, without my assistance, such as playing with empty boxes, using a paper towel roll as a trumpet, etc. She and I were looking for some new ideas..."
4,Awesome book!,"I use this book as part of writing my bi-weekly curriculum at work. It is a fantastic book with lots of great ideas. Some of the activities are geared more toward an older toddler's abilities, but I've had younger ones enjoy them as well. My favorite thing about this book is that its not just all arts and crafts. It includes games and activities for when you are on the go. It provides great recipes for different types of playdoughs and paints that are completely non-toxic. I recommend this book to any teacher (or parent), not only for toddlers but perhaps slightly older children as well. This is a great buy!"
3,Good ideas for those rainy days.,"The book has ideas for activities that require more planning than I can manage. We do a lot of arts/crafts and baking. I love the idea of recycling and reusing, but this book has not been my ""go to"" when I need something to entertain the troops (2 small children)."
3,Meh,"Has a few good ideas, although some seem inappropriate for toddlers (small parts). Probably better for older toddlers/pre-schoolers. If you're internet savvy you can find these and better ideas online for free."
3,Basic & easy activities for toddlers.,"I am glad that I purchased this book (used) to provide me with ideas for activities while my 17 mo. old and I are trapped inside this winter. I have honestly not tried any of the ideas but I plan on it. Some seem really neat and I am looking forward to seeing my son's reaction. Others are just ho-hum. But I must give the author credit for coming up with such a large amount of things to do with toddlers. Obviously, I can't come up with much, which is why I bought the book! If you can check it out from the library, or buy it used like I did, it's a pretty good resource to have on hand."
2,not impressed.,I was pretty disappointed with this book. I teach two year olds and it really didn't have anything new to offer me. But I do think that some mom's might find it useful. I will probably pass it along to someone else.
2,Did not meet my needs,I was looking for more theme based ideas.. this is a get out your pots and pans and let them pretend they are cook kind of book... I can think of those things on my own.
5,Lots of activities for your busy toddler,Lots of creative activities for toddlers. It also includes what supplies you might need for a specific activity.
1,Waste of Money,"This book is kinda ridiculous. The suggestions are either common sense or so crazy that no one would ever attempt. Such as preparing 3lbs of spaghetti with oil and filling up a baby pool for your children to play in. Or put a mirror in a box so when your child opens the box they see themselves, unless you don't want your children playing with glass (and who does?) then the book suggests an alternative of placing pictures of the child inside the box. Really, pictures in a box is a busy activity? Save your money, parenting magazines have way better ideas for keeping little ones busy."
5,very helpful,"I have a 20-month-old, and I have found this book to be very useful. There are so many easy and fun ideas. I have found that entertaining a toddler doesn't need to involve a whole lot of time or money. A lot of these activities require very little preparation or materials. Sure, you can find a lot of toddler activity ideas on the internet, but it's nice to have so many organized into a book. Besides, a lot of blogger mom ideas can be a little over the top so this book is just right. Very realistic and fun. Nice resource to have around!"
2,Not worth the money!,"This book is not bad, but it certainly isn't worth the money. Most of these ideas if you did a web search for ""toddler activities"" you could find them without costing you a dime. So, in hindsight I should have looked around a little more before buying the book."
4,To much fun for toddler,"This book is great it gives me lots of ideas to keep my busy toddler busy.In the book their is chapter on rainy days, what recycled products you should keep like bottle caps, clothes pins, alumnium.I have a family member watch my son while i am at work and this books helps me to plan lessons plans as if he was in daycare."
5,Great book for Grandmother's,"I am really enjoying this compendium of ideas for toddlers. I was a working single mom, and I didn't have a lot of time to make things and do things. My daughter, now a young mom, has a career that keeps her plenty busy. But now I have more time, and can implement many ideas, and help her implement some as well. This is a terrific book!"
5,Great book for the little ones~,This book is great for those cold/rainy days when you are stuck inside! Tons of good ideas! I have used several of the craft ideas and my two year old grandaughter loved them.
3,If I used my own head...,...I could probably come up with most of the ideas in this book. It's O.K. and has some good suggestions for materials to purchase but I have barely consulted it.
2,"outdated, pill bottles for kids?!",Not a fan. Not only is it outdated (film canisters mentioned many times) but she recommends using pill bottles and kleenex boxes as toys/distractions for your kids. WTH? Not a fan of this book. Plan to get rid of it when I clean out some books. Waste of $.
2,Very plain,"I am a preschool teacher and was very disappointed with this book. It is very plain. Unless you have never been a mom, ever baby sat and never around kids in your life you know almost everything in this book. The author seemed to really be stretching with coming up with 365 ideas. Really...as a mom you should know that kids like to paint, color, etc. Do we really need a book for that? I gave it two stars because their were a few crafts I thought were neat but nothing I probably couldn't have found by doing a search on google. And the worst is there were no pictures what so ever. I returned the book..not even worth my $10."
1,Very boring,I have read half of this book so far and so far I do not find any of the activities listed to be interesting. My kids are 2 and it all seems so simple and boring and things that will only occupy them probably for 5 minutes the most. Disappointed.
5,Great book,It got me through winter with a two-year old and a newborn while living in a five-floor walk-up in Brooklyn NY. It's a good book.
5,a must have!,this book is a must have. it has a lot of great ideas/crafts. and it only requires things that everybody has at home already. no need to buy anything to have fun! absolutly a great thing to have. I am a mother of two and I stay at home with my children. it helps for their development and for the rainny days. my son's instructions teacher lended it to me and I liked it so much I had to buy it.
4,Simple but good,"This is a good book if you, like myself, have days where you just look at your child and think ""What are we going to do today?"". It has lots of simple ideas as well as ones that are more complex."
2,not that useful,"Most of the suggestions in this book were not useful to me. Many of them were totally obvious. First, quite a few were different versions of ""make a box of toys for a rainy day"", or different versions of ""gather kitchen tools, tupperware, pots and pans"". Second, a lot of the activities take a lot of time to prepare and then keep the kid entertain for just a couple of minutes. Third, some suggestions are just home-made versions of very cheap toys that I just rather buy than spend so much effort and make a mess at home preparing them. In this class you'll find home-made playdoh, bubbles, stacking cups, markers, puzzles, etc. Overall I found this book a waste of money and time. Not a single original idea that I could use."
3,review of busy book,"I disagree with the reviews written so far. I bought this book expecting to find activities to occupy my very active 23 month old. Maybe my child is already too old for some of the activities, but she was bored with many of them (and some took a good amount of time to put together). Some hits were recipes for homemade clay and play with jello. The book also needs organization by age - maybe year 1, 2, 3 would be helpful."
5,Inspiration to Moms,"We all wonder, are we doing enough with our kids? Trish Kuffner answers this question for us in the intro--she is very encouraging to us moms and others caring for young children, saying that just from being with us day to day, they're learning. That said, she then gives 365 ideas of things to do instead of watching TV. These ideas are easy to implement and I have several that I can't wait for my 19 month old to try."
2,Word of Caution,"I hesitated to write a review but after reading farther into the book I had to. The author suggests using such things as balloons, marbles, pennies, etc. as part of her activities which I strongly feel are not age appropriate ""toys"". I know some will read this and think that close adult supervision is all that is needed, however, if you're contemplating buying this book, you probably know how quick a toddler can be.With that said, there are some good suggestions in the book, my daughter enjoys them. Some though I will keep until she's a little older."
2,Meh.......,"I was so excited for this book. I was pretty disappointed when I sat down with a cup of tea and notepad ready to prepare my funfilled week of activities. Some of the activities require a lot of preparation and then last 30 seconds. Others require materials that most of us don't have ""leftover"". The energy and time some of these take in preparation actually take time away from my toddler, for example, making crayons out of old crayons on a hot stove, melting them in tin cans and then setting them in a cast, just so she can colour with them is really time consuming when I can buy a box for $2 and enjoy my time with her. There were a few fun ideas I liked, but overall, these are just unrealistic or things that my toddler invents on her own, like turning a shoebox into a doll bed.I am sad that I had to give this book a bad review."
2,Lots of common sense,This book really did not give us many new ideas. It is not bad if you get seriously stuck and can not think. Some of the ideas were so basic they bordered on boring.
4,Lots Of Ideas for Fun,"Not the best in the world, I am sure, but its not a bad book either. We, as a creative family, keep many of the suggested items on hand (and I would recommend that anyone with small children keep a storage area filled with craft supplies), so it was nice to have some ideas of what to do with my 2 year old. While some of the ideas ARE very basic, sometimes the brain of a frazzled parent needs a jump start, and while you may say ""well duh"" after reading it, it might not be something you would have thought of right off to begin with.We have enjoyed lots of activites with this book, and while its not arranged by age groups, parents should be somewhat aware of what their child as an individual will be able to do/enjoy. If you have a two year old who likes to put small objects in their mouth then dont do those activities-its that simple! But the amount of games and ideas are good for a variety of stages in your toddlers development and can be great spur of the moment activities."
5,"GREAT, Fun Ideas","I love this book! I just pulled it out again because my 21-month-old daughter and I have gotten into a little bit of a rut. There's been a lot more TV time than I like. Going through here again to pick out some activities, I've noticed so many new things she wouldn't have enjoyed or understood when I bought this book several months ago. Things I dismissed at the time for this reason will now be perfect for her age and current interests. That's the best thing about ""The Toddler's Busy Book."" There is almost too much to do in there. There are simple ideas and more complex ones with some real planning involved. But since toddlers have a short attention span and are always challenging you to find fun and interesting new things, the vast resources in ""The Toddler's Busy Book"" will help keep activities fresh and exciting for your toddler (and you)!"
5,My kids love this book!,"Why? Because everytime I read it--and I do so very often--they know they are going to get to do something fun and creative. I turn to this book time and again for inspirational ideas for everything from outside play (jello in the kiddie pool?!) to fun snacks my little ones can make ""all by myself."" I highly recommend this book to anyone with small children. Her ideas about take along activity bags for doctor's appointments and other kid-unfriendly outings make the book worth every penny--and that is just the tip of the iceburg. Have a great time building memories with your children and this book!"
4,The busy book for toddlers,I work at a daycare and work with young toddlers. I have had many great ideas come from this book. I take the ideas in the book and then see what the children do with them. I usually will go with the flow of what the children want to do so sometimes it doesn't turn out like the book says but it is still great to see what the children do with the ideas. I recommend this book to any Young Toddler teacher. It helps out alot.
1,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this book I thought it was much bigger. When I got the package, It was so small I thought that I got the wrong book. It was not what I thought I ordered. If you are looking for a book to use in a school setting, this is not the book."
2,Not what I was looking for,"While the concept is great, the ideas are lacking what I was looking for. Unless you have never been around children, are a first time Mom and have never babysat in your life, the majority of the suggestions in here have been tried already. Perhaps when I had my first in my early 20's this would have been more helpful as there are numerous inexpensive imaginary ideas but now on my 2nd child I had already tried the things suggested. I wouldn't recommend it, most people have enough common sense to come up with the ideas included in the book."
3,Wasn't what I expected,"I knew it was a used book, but this book looked like it went through the washer and dryer a few times..."
2,Some unhelpful suggestions,"There is actually an activity idea in this book to give your toddler a full box of kleenex and let them pull out the tissues one by one. Something I would NEVER encourage a toddler how to do--or they will be doing it all the time, whether you want them to or not. I was hoping for more craft ideas, but the book tending to be more passtimes than anything else. Helpful for some, but not what I was looking for."
2,Not that great,"I have a very active almost 2 year old at home. This book seems to be written for people with little or no imagination whatsoever!! Many of the activities we have already tried, some of them my son came up with on his own! Also, you better have a huge amount of storage for all of the craft/used items you need to play some of these games!"
1,Extremley Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the book. The pages are boring and gray, most of the activities require you to shop for a ton of different ""craft items"". I will be looking for another Activity book for my 2 1/2 year old."
1,Bargain book purchase,"I had this title saved in my shopping cart for weeks. I had read all the reviews for this book and all were encourging except maybe one or two. Thankfully I hadn't made my purchase because I caught a glimpse of ""The Toddler Busy Book"" under a stack of books at my local bargain store.I was going to purchase this book on amazon but I'm glad I didn't. I paid $1.98 and got my money's worth. Some of the activities are thoughtful and creative. But most are symplistic and unimaginative. -I wouldn't need some one to suggest giving my toddler a full kleenex box so they could pluck out every tissue for ammusement."
5,Great book,"I have a 18month old and 3.5 year old and this has some great ideas. A lot of them are pretty basic, but you just don't think about them when you're chasing two little ones around! Definitely recommend this book to any parent especially if you stayt home and need lots of ideas!"
3,worth buying for the first chapter,"The first chapter of the book is the most helpful, it gives you ideas for organizing the whole toy system, (keep one box in the kitchen, one in the family room, another for traveling, still another for rainy days, and one last for doing arts and crafts.) Another thing that I like was the long list of things that the author suggests we save and accumulate and keep separately for storage.( empty milk cartons, egg cartons, empty bath rolls, etc.) You can use these for the activities in the book or for some of your own inventions."
4,Good to have handy,"This book has some creative ideas. Some are simple things you could think of on your own, but if you're home with the kids every day, it's nice to have a reference to remind you of good activities you may have forgotten about. Most ideas require little to no supplies, or things you probably have at home already. Overall good buy!"
5,Texas Triplet Mom,I have triplet 2 1/2 year olds and was is need of new ideas to keep three toddlers entertained. I found this book to be very helpful and had some great ideas!
2,Not at all what I thought!,"Not what I was expecting at all. I flipped through the first 100 pages and DO NOT have these things just laying around. And it all seemed like it would be a huge mess. I'm all for creative and cheap but this is not at all what I had in mind! Plus I had to pay for return shipping, in which I actually ended up losing money!"
4,Nice book with limited focus,"For the fan of St Augustine (and New Augustine, now known as West Augustine), this is a necessary read although quite stilted. Does have specifics/details of locations and dates, but Speissegger was right in not giving up his day job for writing."
3,3rd disc hassle,"Well, yes, call the toll-free number and get a busy signal.... consistently.Why did it take Amazon 9 days to finally notify me of this error?Why doesn't FoxConnect.com allow you to submit the information via the web, rather than the phone number (busy busy busy).I think I'll just send this back to Amazon and order a replacement. I'll certainly get it faster."
4,Something To Wish For,"Can't say enough about the quality of this show. Good scripts and an even better ensemble cast. While I do hope that Fox puts in some of the extras that they are putting into the box set, there is something I would love to see them include that I am not sure people might remember.If memory serves, after the final teary scene, after Mary turns out the lights at the WJM newsroom for the last time, there was a tag after the commercial that has never run in the syndicated packages. The camera cuts back to the newsroom set, with Mary center stage. As the audience applauds thunderously, she intrduces each member of the cast. the biggest cheers coming for Ed Asner and Valerie Harper. To me, that was a very classy way to go out. I really hope Fox has the good sense to include that in the last episode."
1,Not What I expected,"Waiting patiently I was finally able to order the last three seasons of MTM. I have to say I was sadly dissapointed. The packaging is sub-standard, cheap plastic covers with no additonal documentation. The video quality is very poor and appears to have been recorded off the TV. I don't know who produced these but they were done on the cheap that is for sure and if you are expecting to complete your box set collection you will be seriously dissapointed.Update 2/20/2011 I watched all the episodes, in broadcast order of course. I saw a couple of my favorite all time episodes and Season 7 did include the curtain call. I'm still a big fan and glad to have all seasons on disk."
3,The Mary Tyler Moore Show - season 7,"I'm happy that I was contacted regarding disc three not having the final bow in the episode ""The Last Show"" and getting a new disc with the final bow very quickly. However, I am disappointed that the 7th season set, as most of the previous season sets did not have more extras. For this reason, I simply find this set satisfactory. Too bad that only season one included excellent extras."
1,Customers outside the States,"Terrific!. What do I have to do if I live abroad? Call the same number? There's no other way like, an e-mail address? This cybertime we live in and they make us contact by phone. Anyybody knows how to do this if you're not in the States? I'm from Spain by the way. The stars are for the inconvenience. The series is great."
4,Love it!,"Mary Tyler Moore, need I say anything else?? She's wonderful, witty, funny. You will love this and all the seasons!"
4,Last season so...,"can we get some bloopers and a documentary about the last season of the show? The Oprah visit? Something?Otherwise, am looking forward to this which will finally complete this set. I love this show and grew up with it."
4,At last,"However I would have happily paid double the price here for a non-bare-bones edition :(Instead it's like the previous seasons: the discs, in a slim dvd case with a single-faced insert (showing the cover and back cover) and not even an episode list! :(It's like FOx said, fine you won, we won't release the remaining 3 seasons only available in a box set, but you will get these in the cheapest way possible."
3,Help getting missing Final Curtain Call,The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Seventh SeasonDoes anyone know how non-US customers can contact FOX to get the replacement disc. I've tried calling the number and their website an there is no way to get through.
3,Curtain Call missing - Fox will replace Disc 3 if you call,My pre-ordered set of MTM Season 7 is also missing the Curtain Call from the final episode. Call the toll-free number on the back of the DVD case and speak to a Fox representative. They will ask you for certain information and they do have replacement discs for disc 3 which they will send to verified buyers. Have your purchase information handy when you call.
4,Replacement Disk,Hey folks if you're one of the ones who did not get the curtain call (like me) Fox is sending out replacement disks! You need to call 888-223-4369 and tell them where you got it and when and they will send you the replacement! At least they are trying to make up for their mistake.
5,Made it afterall,Cannot get enough MTM. Would watch this season again and again and again! Definitely a series worth watching! It was nice seeing Rhoda again after all that time :)
4,Mary Tyler Moore Seventh Season,"One of the DVD discs was blank-- otherwise, the set was good. Should I return the entire set or can you send a replacement disc?"
5,"Thank you, Fox!","***Fox did a very professional job correcting the ""Last Curtain Call"" ommission on the final disc of this season. I called the customer support phone number and less than one week later, they had overnighted a replacement disc. THANK YOU!Thank you, thank you Fox for finally reaching this milestone! It was a long haul but we're going to make it after all. Deepest thanks goes also to Fox for including the series' final casting call on The Last Episode. This was a true gem that has been lost in syndication for over 30 years."
5,ABOUT TIME!,"About time! Oh, it's been such a long wait but it is going to be so worth it! Thanks fox and thanks amazon!"
5,Great little coffeemaker!!,"This little guy really makes good, hot coffee. I love the delay brew (timer setting). You have to turn it on each time you want to use it, which is I like. The carafe is good and sturdy. The water reservoir has a ""wide"" mouth that makes pouring into it very easy without spilling and the entire machine has a small footprint that doesn't take up much counter space. The only thing I wish it had is a lighted display for the time/timer. The display is just plain LED and somewhat hard to see unless you're right on it, but I can live with that because this machine is really great!"
5,great little coffee maker,i love this coffee maker. i'm single and it fits my lifestyle very well. the service was prompt and efficient.
4,Mr Coffee 4-cup,My wife wanted a small coffee maker for the morning take with cup of coffee.The Mr. Coffee fits the bill.
3,Good but not perfect,"I bought this when I was living in the dorms. It worked great. I had it set to go off at 7:30 and when I left for my 8:00 class i had it in my mug ready to go. It's fine for a home with 1 coffee drinker. But there's some things I don't like.Pros:Cheapmakes enough for 1 personprogrammableCons:slow to brewkind of noisyif the pot isn't set in PERFECTLY it will flow overI give this 4 stars for kitchen use, 3 stars for dorm use. If it was quieter, 4 stars for the dorm, but for the price you can't complain too much."
3,Liked older version better,"I bought this to replace an older version of the same model that had broken after several years of daily use. My only complaint is the LCD display that is not nearly as easy to see as the brighter LED display on the older version. Other than that, I like this coffee maker. I was looking for a 4 cup programmable coffee maker that uses a standard paper filter and has a sight glass on the water reservoir. Mr. Coffee was the only brand I found that met those requirements."
4,"Works well, coffee is brewed spot on everytime!","Great little coffeemaker for the price. This makes about two mugs of coffee at a time, so if you are a singleton who regularly downs a couple mugs a day, this is perfect. It also has automatic shutoff so the coffee that stays in the carafe doesn't cook."
3,"Decent coffeemaker, one flaw","The coffeemaker is decent and actually brews pretty quickly. But one problem I have been having with it is that the top cover will not stay on during the end of the brew cycle. This is when steam pressure is highest, and also when the coffeemaker should expel most of the water which has been absorbed by the grounds. It works if I put something on top of the machine, but I really shouldn't have to do that..."
3,coffe maker,its a good product but you have to make sure that before you ordered outside US.basicaly its not suitable for a region are using 220 Volt AC.if you convert the power you still need a high watt to provide. 650 watt.
1,does NOT make 4 cups,This coffee pot is a joke.....the carafe does not hold 4 cups in any way shape or form.It is much too tiny and it is going back to the store unused.
2,More Like 2 Cup Coffeemaker,"I filled the decanter totally full and still got not quite two cups of coffee. I'm talking two normal cups, not mugs. I hope this little piece of crap lasts until I can get something better."
3,Not User Friendly,"The buttons are hard to see. There is an off button and an on button, so you have to look closely to see which is which. The lid is a little resistant. It does make coffee."
3,A Gift,I bought this as a gift for a friend and so far she has been happy with it. I don't know if it will give her problems later but she likes the Mr. Coffee brand.
1,terrible,it leaks and coffee grounds go everywhere. i tried a pod and the water did'nt empty out. not happy...............
1,Unreliable,I bought this coffee maker and the clock never kept the right time. This is obviously a problem when using the automatic programable start button. I returned it and got another in hope it was a faulty maker but the second one did the same thing
5,Perfect,I bought this coffee maker for my daughter and she loves it. She says it doesn't really make 32 ounces as one would think from the description but for her the amount is perfect.
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee 4-cup Coffeemaker for which I was having trouble finding a replacement carafe. This coffeemaker is nothing like the older model. I don't like anything about it! New design makes adding water awkward, the on/off switches are located too close to each other which can be confusing. Worst problem, after you have the first cup, even only 10 minutes after brewing, all subsequent cups taste burnt, stale. Awful! This will go in the garbage as soon as I locate another 4-cup brewer."
3,"Good for the Price,","For what I paid, I have no real complaints. It's not the best coffee maker out there, and it took many cleanings to get the plastic flavor out of my coffee, but it's reliable and now brews a pretty good (tiny) pot of coffee. However, the carafe design is horrible--there is a lip that curves inward at the top, almost to the point that it is a barrier. I have to turn the pot nearly upside down to get all the coffee out of it, and no matter how careful I am, it spills. Seems like they could have made the unit half an inch taller to accommodate a carafe that doesn't make you defy gravity to get your coffee. But, hey, I paid $20 for it."
4,"Works well, lasts a few years","This is the third one of these that I have purchased in the past few years. Everything about it is great except that I keep having to buy new ones. The same thing happens every time: It works for a few years and then, all of a sudden, the device is ""on"" but it won't heat up."
4,game changer,"having coffee ready to go first thing in the morning is a game changer. No problems with this awesome product since i got it,."
1,Stopped working on the first day!,I am really disappointed with the quality of this coffeemaker. The machine worked only once and then stopped working. The brewing light (green light) comes on for half a second when I press the 'On' button and then goes off. I have let it cool down and unplugged it but it didn't help. My old Mr Coffee machine still works fine after many years!
3,"Great coffee, poor quality","I bought this coffee maker a year and a half ago. It works fine but the lid that closes over the filter and water is almost cracked all the way in half. The arm that releases the water to brew broke at the attachment point to the lid. Honestly, I am not sure how it would crack like that accept for maybe the steam? I have finally decided to toss it because now the maker leaks some when I make a pot of coffee. Why aren't things made to last anymore? Geez..."
5,Great moring cup of Joe,Bought as a gift. They like it and use it every day. And I like the coffe it makes too!
1,broken,"broken when arrived, they sent me another but that one broke in 2 days. if i was u id get a ge or something better then this cheap peice"
1,Junk. Stopped working after 5 months.,This coffee pot is junk. It stopped working properly after only 5 months of 1x per day use. I would not buy this again.
4,Good little coffee pot for one person,"This has been a good little coffee pot as I am the only coffee drinker in the family. I wanted something inexpensive that did not take up much counter space. I use it every day and it make exactly enough coffee for me when filled to the 4 cup (maximum) level. The basket is very small and I first had problems with the coffee grounds being forced over the filter and getting into the coffee or accidentally not ringing the filter just right with my coffee scoop. I have learned to be very careful when putting the coffee in and shake down the filter before I start it. I don't really pay attention to the clock, so I can't comment on that feature. I would like for the warmer to stay on a little longer as it turns itself off before I am complotely through the pot. I have to remember just to turn it off and back on if I want hot coffee from the pot for more that 30 minutes."
3,Non-descipt,"Works okay, no complaint with performance. Quality is not shoddy, but also far from durable. My last copy of this coffee pot lasted about 1.5 years. I don't expect much more, or less, out of this one."
4,Replacing Similar,"I bought this to replace a similar unit. The old one worked well for a long time, but I pulled loose one of the inside tubes trying to clean it. It worked well for years. I like the new one better. The display isn't as bright as the old one, which is a good thing. Makes good drip coffee and pretty quickly."
4,One little defect caused total failure,"I have bought Mr. Coffee coffeemakers for years without a problem so this took me by surprise. The decanter lid was too small for the decanter and sunk into the decanter. This meant that the knob on the decanter lid that pushes up the brew basket so that the brewed coffee drips into the decanter was too low. So the coffee stayed in the brew basket instead of dripping into the decanter. I had my old coffeemaker that had stopped working after over 3 years so I pried off the lids of the old and new decanters and swapped them. Now my new coffeemaker works just fine. If I didn't have the old decanter lid, I would have had to send the whole thing back because the problem with the decanter lid is essentially total failure of the coffeemaker. I gave it 4 stars because I like the coffeemaker so much but if this were the first time I ever bought one, I would have given it one star."
1,Little thing is hugely great but only lasted 4 months,"This tiny little coffee maker has great features for a tiny price. It is very small and doesn't take up a lot of space. Very easy to clean. Makes great coffee. I love that you can set the timer and have the coffee made for you when you wake up. I also love that it has an automatic shut off, so no worring if you remembered to turn the thing off or not. Great maker for the price! UPDATE Only lasted 4 months.....Maybe not so great after all."
3,Dont let its size fool you its a good buy,"The only reason I am giving this coffee pot a 3 is because I am a person who drinks a sick amount of coffee so size wise it is not ideal for more than one persons use, but yet I don't like the big 12 cup coffee pots either because I never drink all the coffee. I love this coffee maker it has been the best machine out of all the ones I have bought. It is the best thing in the world to wake up early in the morning to brewing coffee. Please read the directions on how to set the programmer because I messed up the first time using it because I thought I was smart enough to figure it out on my own. Because it is only a 4 cup pot I fill the water up to the top of the water canister on the machine until it is full but not enough to over flow it, and add 6 spoon fulls of coffee and it makes about 6-8 cups which is a perfect number for me. I absolutely recommend this because it is a decent priced good quality machine."
3,Mr. Coffee,"First coffeemaker did not work. Replacement seems to be OK, at least for the first week of use. 2 more words required--blah, blah."
4,Most reliable little gadget in my kitchen,"My old one lasted for six years; in use daily. So delighted that I could replace it at Amazon. Not only makes great coffee, but terrific for making tea and hot chocolate in small quantities. Carafe fits easily in the dishwasher."
5,Good replacement,"Great little coffee machine, we used to replace same model but 5 years old, the. New one works as good as the old one, but looks nicer. Recommended product for the price"
4,Great little coffee maker,"I live alone and try to limit my caffeine intake so one brew per day works for me. I normally set the delay timer the night before, and when I wake up the coffee is ready. I tend to sip during the morning, so I bought a microwaveable cup to reheat. The shut off timer after an hour works fine for me.Pro's: Doesn't take up much counter space, timer and clock are simple to set, brews coffee fine (have found just a couple grounds in the coffee).Con's: Advertising is misleading (Removable filter basket lifts out for fast and easy filling and cleaning). There is no basket included. I had to order filters from Amazon after I received the coffee maker and found out there is no basket and local stores do not carry 4 cup filters. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
1,Mr. Coffee/Coffee No More,"This was my second Mr. Coffee coffee maker. The first one I purchased at a Target in Pennsylvania and it stopped working after a few months. I loved the time delay brew feature and the taste of the coffee so much I purchased another one from Amazon about a month ago. Yesterday, Mr.Coffee died. Yes, folks, his lights went out and he refused to make a pot of coffee. I'm assuming there is an electrical glitch with this product and I've even contacted Mr. Coffee Company demanding some answers for the money I spent. Mr. Coffee needs to fix this product and provide compensation to those who spent their hard-earned money."
5,Great Little Coffeemaker,The Good: Inexpensive. Small form factor. Easy to program. Perfect amount of coffee for 2 light coffee drinkers. House gets to smell like coffee in the morning.The Bad: The carafe likes to not sit evenly on the burner.The Annoying: Fighting over who empties out the grounds.Overall: Happy with purchase - recommended.
4,Good coffee maker,I don't know much about coffee makers but this one worked as a coffee maker should. My only complaint is that the clock always runs fast and I have to keep resetting it (it'll gain 20 minutes in a week).
3,"It's works well, but there are a fw hurdles","I have to admit, it was my mistake not full realizing how small this coffee maker was when I bought it. It basically makes enough coffee to fill one travel mug, so I'm pretty much always stuck brewing two pots to get enough java.Feature wise everything works as expected. The timed brew feature is handy for setting before you go to sleep. I haven't had any problems with it over all, barring the size factor and that you need to specifically get the Mr. Coffee brand filters for it in order to brew a proper pot. These are not as widely available in my Manhattan neighbourhood as you might think, so I end up getting dinged $7 for shipping to buy a $2 item from a non-prime amazon retailer."
4,Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Programmable Really is 4 Cups,"I've had this little machine for several weeks now. We use it for decaf. I've had no problem with clock function or anything else. Others have mentioned that it's not truly a ""4-cup"" coffee maker, but I'd like to point out that the standard ""cup"" of coffee is generally 6 ounces, not 8, and thus the carafe is a 4-cupper. (Check instructions on coffee packaging -- they usually recommend a tablespoon or so per 6 ounces of water, which reflects the standard.) A feature I like is that it turns itself off after an hour in case I forget and spares me the burned coffee taste. I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a thermal carafe. But all in all, a handy, space-saving machine that's value-priced and makes a good cup of coffee."
2,Needs new carafe design,"I had the old Mr. Coffee coffeemaker for 10 years and loved it, but it died last year, so I bought this new model as a replacement. As other reviewers have mentioned, the carafe spills consistently when you are pouring coffee in your cup. It is not a big deal - just annoying because you will always have to wipe your counter after pouring your coffee. This is a case where Mr. Coffee should have left the original design in place, but I suppose this new model is cheaper for them to manufacture. I have noticed that the coffee filter occasionally folds over at the edge, causing the grounds to get in with your cofee, but this is not very common. If you make sure your filter is pushed out around the edges, it will decrease the chances of that issue. Overall, I am not impressed with this coffeemaker, but it gets the job done."
4,Good coffe maker with good price!,"Just I wish it had a programable shut off time rather than the fixed 2 hours one. Other than this, the product is great."
1,Shorted out after one pot of coffee,"I was able to make one pot of coffee and then the wiring shorted out. Unfortunately, I bought a gold filter, so I wanted to buy another Mr. Coffee brand replacement pot and hopefully this one has a longer lifespan."
2,NOT 4 CUPS,"It;s only about 2.5 because I measured. Just fyi. Other than that, the coffee pot is fine. Its like what you would get at a hotel."
2,Filters for this are hard to find and none included with product,"I'm sorry I am unable to give a balanced review for this product. I have not been able to use this coffee maker because it requires a different filter than what I've used in the past, and Mr Coffee is just to stingy to include a few filters with this coffee maker. I spent the past couple of days trying to find these needed filters - and I live in a big city - and I couldn't find them anywhere. I ended up going on Amazon where the most reasonable bargain for these filters was 23.99 for 1200 filters - much more than I need and more expensive than the coffee maker itself. This does not please me."
2,"Seemed like good value, but machine broke after 2 months","The 12-cup machine is what you need. Don't buy the 4-cup machine because that's barely enough coffee for large mug. I know because I had to ship the 4-cup machine back and re-order this 12-cup one. So the coffee was OK (not great, but not terrible) but then the machine suddenly stopped working. I can't turn it on. I tried returning it, but because I didn't buy it from Amazon directly (but through a vendor) that was not an option after the initial 3-4 week returns window. I'll call Amazon again though... a machine shouldn't last only 2 months.Lessons learned:1) Buy from Amazon directly so you can return items if you need to. Otherwise hard to return to small vendors. Amazon is so much easier to deal with.2) You really do get what you pay for. I'm sure others had this machine work for years and it was fine, but I didn't get so lucky. Keep this in mind. I don't think it's a high quality brand.Hope this helps!"
5,Mr. Coffee DRX5,It works fine. There is nothing else to say as I use this coffee pot every day.No more words at this time.
1,weak coffee,"It's convenient and quick, but the coffee comes out very weak. I have to use more than twice as much ground coffee per cup than I do with my Black and Decker single cup coffee maker."
2,Not up to Mr. Coffee standards...,"Mr. Coffee DRX23 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, BlackI grew up around only Mr. Coffee coffeemakers and this one is a disappointment. The old one here at work finally died after years of use and it was time to replace it. Ordered the DRX23 and immediately we were having problems. The machine would evaporate a lot of water, the pot spout would pour coffee everywhere but in a cup, the timer had a mind of it's own and wouldn't allow us to shut off the timer on the weekends. Contacted Mr. Coffee and they replaced the coffee maker right away. We never did chance using the timer again, the evaporation is still there, but we work around it, and the new pot showed us just how defective our old one was...but, here's the big issue...no matter how you pour the coffee, it still makes a mess.Definitely would recommend a different product!!!"
1,worried about clicking noise,"I bought this product because I trusted Mr. Coffee brands makers to be quality devices. It does brew coffee differently, and the coffee is weaker and murkier, and it never brews five cups and ""exhales"" the rest of the coffee long after you've poured your cup... however, I marked that to the basket and things I didn't like, and it felt cheaper than most Mr. Coffee machines, but I could live with what I felt were poor design features, but now, starting two weeks ago, when finished brewing, it makes loud clicks. Repeatedly. Very loud, almost alarming clicks.I am worried there is a short within and it is potentially dangerous to leave it plugged in on even on for any length of time.I am throwing it out. Very disappointed in Mr. Coffee for this model."
1,Mine Leaks,"Please see my review of the 'Mr. Coffee AR5 4-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, Black'. We're on our second one and both leaked, badly."
5,Just What I Needed!,"I'm a dental student so I NEED coffee made with as much ease as possible in the little time I have. This is easier than making instant coffee! The programming feature is perfect. I put the grounds and water in the night before, and the coffee is ready to be poured in my tumbler in the morning. The coffeemaker keeps the warmer on an hour after the coffee is brewed, so my coffee is kept hot. Another plus is that it will automatically shut off after an hour. Since I live alone, it's the perfect size for me. It looks good and doesn't take up much space on my counter.My coffee did have a plastic taste to it at first. I highly recommend cleaning the coffeemaker out with vinegar first because after I did that, the plastic taste went away. Also, contrary to it being advertised as a 4-cup coffeemaker, it's honestly a 2-cup."
4,"Good coffee maker, but...","... the only problem(S) i had with this are that 1. the lid doesn't snap shut after the first use, and 2) i expected it to come with a few filters and it did not, so I had to go buy those separatelly. I can overcome the lid not snapping shut, it didn't seem to affect its brewing capability, and I guess for a $20 machine its to be expected, but still... kinda cheaply made."
3,A little disapointed,It was disappointing to have the clip to the lid break after just a couple uses.
2,Waste of money,"Pros= takes up little room on the counterCons= No light on the clock and you have to push the delay timer every single time you want it to automatically go on so it won't stay set. Flimsy plastic. Takes way to long to brew. Spend more and get a better one, just don't know what a better one is."
2,"Very noisy, spits water out the back!",I just got this machine after having another Mr.Coffee machine for more than 10 years and which is still working. We just wanted to have something matching our black/stainless steel appliances in the kitchen. The new Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker (Black) is terribly noisy!!!! And it spits out drops of hot water out the back of the machine. We decided to return.... Machine is cute but cons outweighed pros...
1,SIZE,"According to the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America), one cup of coffee is equal to 6 ounces prior to brewing. However, with this Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee maker, one cup is only equal to 4 ounces. Therefore, this only brews a total of 20 ounces, which is the equivalent to one Large coffee from Dunkin Donuts. Just keep that in mind before you decide to purchase this item."
5,Coffee Pot,"This coffee pot is awesome. I pre set it before i go to bed and wake up the the smell of freshly brewed coffee. I previously used a regular Mr. Coffee maker, but i wanted to upgrade to the one where i could have it automatically start the brew."
3,Can't locate the Filter !,"This is a perfect size for my office, however I am not able to locate small coffee filters and have not yet used it. If anyone has some insight where to get them, please let me know."
1,I returned it...,"I didn't pay attention to the reviews and I regret lot...After reading a lot of reviews saying that the coffee that this coffemaker makes tastes bad, I still want to try it since this is small, cute and have a lot of functions that I consider as crucial in a coffee maker...First of all, the coffee really tastes bad!!! It tastes like plastic!!! I tried different coffee bean brands and all tasted terrible... We couldn't drink it... impossible!Second, the digital clock is not precise... after 2 weeks the clock was more than 5 minutes late... I set the clock again and the same thing happened...I returned it..."
2,Mr. Coffee looks like tea.,Having attempted both the automatic use and the delayed use of the coffeemaker the water drips through immediatelyand takes at least ten minutes to heat enough for a cup of coffee. In addition it is necessary to our the water through at least three times in order to get a cup of what appears to be coffee. To say the least I am very disappointed with this product.
2,Stopped working after 5 months,"When I first began using it, it worked great! I was extremely satisfied. Although less than 5 months later it stopped working suddenly."
2,Loses Water,"At first when I bought this, it worked fine. At some point, it started losing water. I fill it up all the way, but the water evaporates or something."
2,"Worked well for a few months, now it burns the coffee","This thing worked well when it was new. About 3 months in, despite keeping it clean, the coffee started tasting burnt and overly bitter even using quality beans. Tried using the Mr. Coffee cleaner and it made it a little better, but it's still no where near new. The issue appears to be that the water simply overheats and burns the coffee. All in all, this thing is good for 2-3 months, after that it's a piece of junk and ruins good coffee."
4,Great little coffee pot,"I needed to buy a coffee pot for my daughter for Christmas. The price was right, so I ordered it. Her coffee pot died so I had to give this one to her early. She absolutely loves it. I would recommend this to friends and relatives."
1,"Poor coffee, smaller than advertised capacity","I bought this coffee maker to replace a Melitta 4 cup coffee maker that had literally worn out; the filter and lid were falling apart. What a disappointment this coffee maker is. The capacity is listed as 4 cups. I understand that's meant to be 6 oz cups, not 8 oz cups, but it doesn't even make that much coffee. My old 4 cup coffee maker made enough coffee for 2 12 oz mugs. This one makes a total of 2.5 8 oz cups, which isn't even enough for 2 mugs of coffee. Plus the quality of the coffee was poor. I'd been using a cone-shaped filter. This is the basket type and the flavor and strength is much weaker. The result, I just bought a larger Melitta coffee makerMelitta 46894 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker. I know from past experience, that I will be able to depend on the Melitta. This was a waste of money."
5,good coffee,This coffee maker is ideal for my 88 year old father. Easy to operate. Makes a good cup of joe.
4,Great 4 cup coffeemaker,This is the second one of these I've bought and it makes great coffee. I really like the auto shutoff feature.
3,Cofee 2009,I liked the cofee makers efficiency. I did not like the temperature of the water. Not hot enough.
3,Not what I expected,"I returned this coffee maker for two reasons. First, I assumed that a 4 cup coffee maker would make a total of 32 oz. of coffee. Who knew that in the coffee industry 5 oz. is a cup. Second, I thought it was well known that plastic and hot water don't mix well, both from a health and taste perspective. Being a new coffee drinker, I'm not sure I want to drink coffee that's been run through a a bunch of plastic.I realize that neither of these issues is specific to this coffee maker. For me, the solution was to use a french press, where the hot water doesn't come into contact with nearly as much plastic.On a positive note, Amazon allowed me to return this item with no questions asked."
1,Broke after 3 months!,"While it was working, worked great. Nice wide mouth to water tank, easy to fill, brewed just fine.I kept noticing that even though I'd set the time, a day or two later, the clock would be blinking, like the power had shut off, which it hadn't. Finally the other day, I noticed it blinking again, this time, very faint, and very quick blink, almost couldn't read the clock display. Tried to use it, none of the buttons do anything, it no longer works. Not a happy camper. :-("
3,LEAKS,I like this machine..small compact..enough for one person... BUT....it leaks like crazy!!! Would need a towel folded for machine to sit on to collect approx. 1/3 cup of water each time coffee is brewed.
1,Not a 4 Cup,"Very small, did not hold 4 cups of water. It should be described as a single person coffee pot, only holding about 3 cups of coffee."
2,Defective and Small,"The one I received was defective - it is always hot as long as it's plugged in, which makes the on/off switch and the programming completely useless. I should also note that the ""4 cups"" it makes are pretty small - for me, it's about 2 mugs of coffee. My last 4-cup coffee maker made more."
4,Good little coffee maker,"I received this a Christmas gift in Dec 2010 and have had no problems with it at all. It's easily programmed and turns out a good cup of coffee. I only wish that the lid closed more securely, sometimes steam escapes if I don't press it down hard enough. Otherwise I'm more than happy."
1,Worst Coffee Maker EVER!,"This is the worst coffee maker EVER! First of all, it smells like plastic. But the bigger problem is that it leaks! I was very excited to have a programmable coffee maker, but when I got up in the morning, only half a pot of coffee was made and the rest of the water dripped all over the counter. I tried again the next day, thinking maybe I'd done something wrong, but the next morning, there was no coffee made and a pot of water spilled on the counter and floor! I DO NOT recommend. Cheap."
3,"So far so good, but....","I would have thought that Mr. Coffee could do better than this. It seems to brew so fast that the coffee is weak. After it brews, I pour it back in to brew again. Also, pouring the water into the reservior can be tricky because you have to pour it so close to the actual coffee filter. Other than that, it's a good value for the money."
2,coffee,Product did not satisfied my needs. I have already returned it.Product did not do what it was supposed to do as per the instructions.
2,sub standard,"Bought to replace an 8 cup which worked for years, reliably. (Make Black & Decker)1. Very difficult to poor water into tank without spilling.2. Silly design of carafe with attached lid makes it difficult to pour w/o the cap falling lose and spilling3. Pause feature - when you remove the carafe, worked only 2 days. Then stopped. Now we wait for entire pot to finish, if not coffee spills everywhere."
4,"Nice, small and works","Nice little coffee maker. I was getting tired of wasting coffee in a 10 or 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker. The Cuisinart finally quit and I decided on this one from the positive reviews. Also got the gold filter basket replacement to keep from buying oddball filters.Does a good job. I don't use the timers, so can't comment on that, but the auto-off timer is a little short.Seems well made. Be careful putting the basket in - if the lid does not close flat, it is in wrong."
4,Economical,"I bought this coffeemaker to save money after deciding my K-Cup machines was costing us way too much money. What I like about this little guy is that it has an automatic brew, so that when I get up in the morning, the coffee is waiting for me. It's perfect for myself and if my husband wants a cup too. And, it takes up very little space.The only issue I have with it, is that the coffee does not come up real hot, unless it sits there for awhile, but I will just ususally pop it into the microwave for 10-15 seconds."
5,loved it!!!,cheap price and i'm still using it and it's absolutely easy to use!!! love making my coffee with it and it's awesome!!
4,mr coffee drx5,"(4) cup coffee maker I am very happy with this item,also the service was excellent,MR COFFEE is a quality product,nice price!!"
4,Enjoying every cup!,I love my 4 Cup Coffeemaker. Enjoying every cup on those cold mornings. I truly would recommend this product. Thanks!
4,Works as advertised,"Look, I like a great cup of coffee as much as the next guy, but sometimes you just need to have a quick cup. This machine won't make the world's greatest coffee by a good margin, but for everyday use, it fits the bill. Perfect for churning up the morning joe."
1,Beware!,"I purchased this pot 2 weeks ago to replace my Cuisinart. This pot continually overflows, no matter how careful I am lining it up, and I end up with coffee grinds in the pot and all over the coffee maker. My Cuisinart only did this occassionally and I found it annoying but this pot is really the PITTS. Perhaps I just got a lemon but for now I would definitely not recommend it. You are probably better off buying a larger coffee maker and making only 4 cups in it."
2,Broke after one use,"I made one pot of coffee and one of the tabs on the lid broke. They are sending me another one. I can make coffee with the broken lid, but it is kinda annoying."
1,Missed Her Coffee,"My orignal 4 cup Mr Coffee lasted a few years and I loved the little machine. It broke and I ordered another from Amazon and it arrived with a horrible plastic smell. Made several pots of coffee, put the thing outside, and still a horrible plastic smell. Sent it back for an exchange. Amazon promptly sent a replacement which has a different problem - the lid won't stay up. What's up Mr Coffee - have you lost all quality control or what?For now, I'm back to my big 8 cup Cuisinart."
5,"Great price, very convenient","I love this coffee maker, especially for the price, compared to other makers. Reliable brand, great capacity for my morning coffee; I always have some to take with me to work after my first cup at home. It can be programmed which is great when I can't handle making coffee when I'm half asleep, and it keeps the coffee hot until you're done, but will shut off after an hour, I believe, just in case you forget you left it on. I recommend getting the reusable filter to go along with it."
3,"Good for the price, but weak coffee","I got mine at Target for $15. Great price, but the coffee is really weak! Strange. It comes out kind of watery. I have to use more coffee than normal. I've seen other people complain about this on other sites but, interestingly, not here. I guess I can't complain much since it was so cheap, but my coffee just doesn't taste right so I'm not sure what to do."
4,"Good coffee maker, but smaller than expected","I've only owned it a couple days, but I like it so far. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and the programmable setting works just fine.My only complaint is with their definition of ""4 cups"". I don't know what cups we're talking about here, but it certainly isn't the standard 8 oz. measurement. I've never owned a 4-cup coffee maker before, and I don't know if this is standard measurement, but I was a bit surprised with how small it was. I made an entire pot this morning, and it didn't quite fill up my 20 oz. thermos. You do the math on that one.However, it doesn't bother me because I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee, and it makes the perfect amount for me. I just thought it would be important to note that it might be surprisingly small if you're looking for a literal ""4 cups""."
1,A real pain in the neck!,"Designed such that the filter paper frequently collapses inside, causing lots of grinds in each pot (unless you stand there with your fingers or a spook and wet the paper, sticking the wet edges to the inside walls of the filter compartment)."
5,Perfect!,"I have had this coffee maker about a week now. Everything works great! I had one of the older non-programmable Mr. Coffee's that was still working, but I wanted this one especially because of the auto shut off. So far eveything works great and the best part is the coffee is screaming hot. The other maker I had it was hot, but not nearly as hot of the coffee that comes out of this one. For the price, if it only lasts me a year, I still think it was worth it."
3,Mr. Coffee 12 Cup Coffeemaker,The Coffermaker itself is fine. However the glass coffee carafe spills coffee everywhere if you don't pour it very very very slowly.
3,they ain't kidding about the PAUSE feature,Sometimes the time/display/control panel flashes if any coffee gets on the warming plate (by itself while brewing) in which the coffee then stops midway. The time flashes in which the coffee maker flashes on and off. You either have to wipe it off and wait or unplug it and wait. REAL PAIN when you need your coffee on the go. Other wise it's good and the time does lose some time too (from it flashing).
1,piece of garbage,"Terrible! Worked for one month then just ""brews"" until all water evaporates and there is a 1 cup puddle of ""coffee"". Please don't clog the landfills with this piece of trash!"
4,Good Machine BUT it's 4 - 5oz cups NOT 32 Ounces,"Just got this coffee maker and it's really great. HOWEVER when I read the manual I noted that it said one tablespoon of coffee for each 5 ounce cup.""Huh?"" I thought. And you know what? It's 4 five-ounce cups of coffee NOT 4 eight-ounce cups. So this coffee maker really only makes ONE LARGE MUG plus a warm-up splash.This is NOT Mr. Coffee's fault I learned. Just about ALL coffee makers when they list number of CUPS actually mean 5 ounces (a European metric) NOT the American 8 ounces.So beware. If all you really want is a large mug plus a splash/warmer, get this. It's really cute and quick. But if you really want 32 ounces of coffee, this will NOT do the job. You need to get a coffee maker that claims to make 6 cups or more (6 x 5 = 30)."
3,Disappointed,I've never had carafes break until I bought this coffee maker. Two carafes broke and I did not bump them into anything nor leave them on a hot burner. The carafes alone are $10 plus shipping.
5,Just what my sister wanted for Christmas,This little programable Mr. Coffee 4-cupper is just what my sister wanted for Christmas! I also ordered her some Costa Rican coffee from Cafe Britt to go with Mr. Coffee. She is the only one in her family who drinks coffee and she says it is so easy to have it ready for the next day because after she finishes her morning coffee she makes it up for the next day and presses a button and voila! Hot coffee ready and waiting for her the next morning. She says it is so easy to set which is good for those of us who can's set our alarm clocks or operate our cell phones. Yeah!
4,No clock troubles here!,"For the record, I've owned this model since December 2006 and it's kept perfect time."
2,DIGITAL DISPLAY DOES NOT LIGHT UP,The first Mr. Coffee 4 cup I bought had a LED display that was easy to read. The new one has a LCD display that requires you to turn on every light in the kitchen to read it. This is a hassle after dark and you want to program it without waking the entire family.
3,Mr. coffee 4 cup,"excellent product, you make coffee at short time of period, this content a lot modern device as alarm, and you know coffee is ready to serve. I'm totally satisfied with this product..."
3,Mr. Coffee DRX5-,The coffee has a little bit of a plastic taste to it. Maybe because it is new. It worked very well right out of the box. Also very hot.
1,Plastic,"Tastes like plastic! I have run water through it over 20x...still plastic. I would not recommend buying this product. I wish I could return it, but I've already tried running it too many times and had to throw out the coffee."
2,Less is Less than 4 cups,"I have had this coffee maker for about 4 months. I have always felt like it did not really hold 4 cups as stated on the box as well as on the pot and on the side of the actual unit. This morning I just happen to have a 2 cup glass measuring ""cup"" in my hand and used it for the first time to fill it up. The 4 cup coffee maker will hold a maximum of 2 1/2 cups. I'd understand if it was 3 1/2 - that's pretty close, but 2 1/2 is WAY off."
2,disgusted,"I purchased this coffee maker on Sept. 9, 2010. On December 7, it quit working. The water evaporated but none dripped into the decanter. Not a great bargain when it lasted less than 3 months."
2,Unit Failed After About 1 Year,"It worked okay. Then, one morning the clock was flashing. I figured it was due to a power outage. I could not get the unit to respond. All the mechanical workings are still fine. The main power to the unit is fine. But, I cannot get it to work because of the failed electronics."
4,Good Coffee maker.,"This is a great coffee maker IF your only making coffee for urself, and ur not a big coffee drinker. It's perfect for me because I usually only need one cup of coffee to keep me going. However, if your going to need multiple cups or want to make coffee for multiple ppl you will most likely want to look at 10 cup coffee makers or higher."
3,A good little coffee maker,"We recently bought this to replace the French press we had been using for a few years. He loves it. It is simple to use and has held up so far. We love it and really appreciate the place to store the electric cord.Edit: After having this thing for a while, it leaks every time we use it. It is very annoying and thus in only a few short months it isn't being used much anymore."
5,LOVE IT,"I just cant get enough coffee... this machine works great, its reliable and is perfect for a home or office or even a home office ha ha"
2,Little coffee maker was a big disappointment,"I bought this for the office as my 12 cup coffee maker had finally broken after years of use. I had only been making half a pot and thought this little one would be ideal. The quantity was just right and I bought a permanent filter to cut down on wasteful paper filters. However, with just two or three uses a day, the lid broke after six weeks' use. Big disappointment."
3,Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup programmable coffeemaker,"Coffeemaker is good, but the display can't be seen in the dark. It should have a LED display and to set the time of day is to easy. It can be accidently changed just by bumping the buttons. It needs a time set button to hold in to set the timelike the delay brew button."
3,replaced my delonghi,"Again wanted a programmable coffee maker! This replaced my thermal Delonghi style (no longer made).I always check the time, and reset it if needed. So far the only complaint I have, is pause and brew feature!so to make it work without feature I removed the plunger and the carafe cover.Honestly I preferred the 5 cup modelthe maker(sometimes it seems to run slow).I use a permanent filter and one paper filter it makes cleanup much easier.So far so happy and glad, to have my coffee ready when I wake! I don't understand the clock complaints fromothers? You can make the coffee an hour before waking, it will stay hot 2 hrs after it brews?I bought these 2 more as spares in case my 5 cup dies. I usually transfer my brewed coffee to a thermalmug anyway and shut the coffee maker off."
2,Mr. Coffee....round #2,"Mr. Coffee #1 with a stainless steel pot, was just warm. didn't get hot enough!!Mr. Coffee #2 pot was too small (4 cups) THIS POT!!4 cups really = 2 cups.Switched to a Percolator! My husband LOVES IT!!"
2,Broke after a year,Bought the DRX5 13 months ago...it just broke down. would try brewing 4 cups and only 2 cups come out. tried cleaning multiple times and it didn't help.Read lots of reviews that people use theirs for years. guess i got a bad one...guess u get what u pay for.
3,Good for its price,"The coffee machine came within a week after order placed. it is compact size and it works great for its price. the timer doesn't work, but that is OK because you don't leave the machine on for the whole day anyway."
3,Forget the clock.,"Makes a nice cup of coffee, but the clock is impossible to read, day or night. Older models had a useful, red illuminated clock. Mr. Coffee obviously ""cheaped out."" Disappointing."
2,Coffee tastes odd,"I have cleaned this thing over and over and when I use it in my dorm room the coffee comes out with an odd taste. I have used the city water and I used bottled water and both came out with the same taste. It's a great size and easy to transport, but consider a different brand before you purchase."
1,Disappointing.....,"Purchased this small size maker so I didn't have to stop on the way to work in the morning. Does the job as I can set the timer at night and make my travel mug quick when I'm running out the door.Unfortunately the plastic top was not made big enough to fit on the outer edge of the pot rim. So after a few uses it has now flexed down into the pot and doesn't push up on the spring enough to let the coffee run into the pot below.In short... the coffee maker ""blows up"", all the water stays in the filter/coffee part of the machine and flows back into the main reservoir. So now you get a big mess of grounds and coffee water all inside the machine and nothing in the pot.I just saw a full size one with a timer for $16 on sale at the local department store so I think I'm just going to get a replacement and toss this one.Sorry to say ..... it's junk until they fix the lid for the pot."
4,brews great coffee,Love the timer feature. Keeps excellent time and makes up to 4 cups of coffee in less than 5 minutes
5,I love it!,"quick service, very satisfied It arrived promptly and works great. thanks for the order I received. I will be ordering again."
1,Horrible plastic taste,"I followed the instructions for cleaning the coffeemaker before using it but even after doing that and using it a number of times (and re-cleaning), the coffee tastes and smells like burnt plastic--which can't be good for one's health."
3,Carafe cracked within a year!,"It's a good coffee maker. Unfortunately because it's so cheap, the carafe cracks VERY easily. I had it less than a year when I got cracks on the lip of the carafe.TheMr. Coffee 4-Cup Replacement Decanter, with shipping (no Prime) is $15.I debated where to get a new different coffee maker, but I decided it is less environmentally wasteful to just get a carafe. Carafe was made in Czech."
3,It's Ok,"I don't like this Mr Coffee as much as my last one. It causes alot of fluid spill. The pot spout is narrow, so when pouring coffee into our cups it overflows the spout onto the countertop no matter how slow you pour it. There are two holes in the back of the coffee maker designed, I guess, so you don't overfill the water resevoir. When I'm pushing the coffeemaker back into place on our countertop after filling it, the water swishes and spills out of the holes. Then, when you lift the lid and pull out the coffee basket, condensed water spills onto the hot plate, another area you have to wipe up. I'll deal with it because I don't want to pay the ridiculous prices for another time delay coffee pot but it's a pain in the neck to keep having to wipe up spills"
5,Perfect for a single gal !,I have been so pleased with this great little coffee maker. The amount of coffee brewed might be 4 cups in very tiny cups... but it is the perfect size pot to fill my thermal container each morning with some milk and chocolate and I'm out the door ! LOVE IT !!!
5,What's Not to Like?,"I've had this little coffeemaker for several months now and I just love it.From the reviews I've read, people are either nit-picking (flip-up top, spillage when filling with water) or they happened to get a lemon, which can happen with anything. The pouring problem is easily remedied by using a little common sense and pouring from something with a spout: i.e. a 2-cup measuring cup. Voila! No mess. If the product just doesn't work, send it back and get a replacement. This is a great little coffeemaker at a great price."
1,Electronics broke,"After just 3 months of use, the electronics died and the coffee maker does not work at all. I am extremely disappointed. I will not buy this brand again."
4,This is VERY SMALL,"It's NOT 4 cup coffeemaker. Not sure what should the size be of such a cup, so that you'd need 4 cups. It's just ONE standard coffee mug."
2,Only 2 cups?,"While this is advertised as a 4-cup coffee maker, what we got was only a 2 cup machine. The carafe says that it's 4 cups, but we measured 2 cups in a measuring cup and it exactly filled the carafe. Unfortunately, we've opened it and used it once, so we're stuck with it. When I buy another coffee maker, it won't be through Amazon. This is the first time I've been unhappy with an Amazon purchase."
2,Stopped working in 4months,"Not bad for a small coffee maker, and the carafe does not drip all over when pouring; however, the brewed coffee never is hot enough. Then the brewing malfunctioned in 4 months. Water simply sputters and very slowly goes through but never all of it. Tried cleaning and still have the problem. Store won't take it back because it's past 90 days. Waiting to hear from MrCoffee."
2,Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-Cup,"Taste of coffee is OK, but the warmer remains on only for 1 hr after brewing (my old 4-cup Krups stayed on forever). Also the warmer doesn't do the best job of keeping the coffee hot."
4,More like 3 cups,"Perfect coffee maker for one person, but when they say 4 cups they mean actual 8 oz. cups. Most people like us use bigger cups. In my house we only get 2 cups out of it, but we still like it a lot."
5,My alternative to getting a bucket of cold water thrown on my head to get my butt out of bed each morning,"I used to be a morning person. Not anymore. Typically, my boyfriend has to literally drag me out of bed to get me up so I can get to work when I want to. Unfortunately, work is taking him away for 8 weeks and busy season is upon me. My solution? Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup Programmable Coffeemaker. Despite the fact that I already have a Keurig and a french press, I am super pleased with this purchase as it has successfully allowed me to scheme myself into once again becoming a morning person. I put it in my bedroom and the smell of coffee each morning is a much more pleasant experience for starting my day. At $25, this is a steal and I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner. Thanks, Mr. Coffee, for helping me conquer this busy season! #CPAsolutions."
5,This is my new alarm clock.,"I now wake up in the morning to the delicious smell of coffee brewing in my house. Makes me want to get up in the morning, but with the hour long heater you can still sleep in and have great coffee.I do have one problem with the timer though. I think coffee tastes best when brewed right after grinding. Still it's so nice to wake up to the smell of coffee."
5,Makes coffee. Looks cute.,"It does what it's supposed to, makes coffee. It comes out good tasting, hot and fast. Looks very cute, too! A+"
5,Mmmmm good!,"The coffee maker replaces a white one that got very stained. Its appearance is lovely: black matte, not shiny. The clock seems to be keeping good time. I love the auto-shutoff, as I often forgot to turn the maker off and the remaining coffee was not drinkable! There is no dripping when pouring the coffee into a cup, either. I checked the auto timer to see if it works,it does. So far there is nothing negative I can say about the unit. The smaller carafe is also a plus.I live alone so this is the perfect coffeemaker for one person. I do recommend a permanent filter, if the unit does not come with one. You can fill it before putting in the holder - that assures no grounds get in the holder or water. The paper filters are difficult to keep upright and then you have a mess."
4,Mr. Coffee DRX5 4-cup,This is a great little coffee maker if you don't drink a lot of coffee. The down side is it's suppose to be a 4 cup coffeemaker. It's only a 2 cup coffee maker with regular size cups. But that's not a big deal for us. We just make two pots and that way it's fresh.
2,"Nice idea, but disappointing!!","I received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time. However, as other reviewers noted, almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day. I wasn't intending to use the delay feature very often so I didn't bother to return it. Now, just short of a year after I received it, it suddenly started working, so I'm shopping for a replacement. I might try another Mr. Coffee model with better reviews, but not this one!"
2,Lousy coffee,"We've had The Mr Coffee DRX5 for about 3 years. Price it right - but it is not a good choice if you want good coffee. Why not? Bad design. It takes several minutes - like 10 minutes - for this coffee maker to stop making that 'boiling' sound at the end of the coffee making cycle, when it's making steam, not hot water. The steam mostly collects at the top and drips back down onto the boiler. But while it's boiling away it also continues to steam the coffee grounds, which I think is why the coffee tastes so bitter. Also, I think the coffee makers with the flat-bottomed holders like this one can't make coffee as well as the makers with the cone-shaped holders. Keep looking."
2,Coffee Basket Flops Around,"Alot of times this coffee maker works fine, but it's by chance. The directions say place the coffee basket in securely before brewing the coffee. And IT DOES fit in securely as long as there isnt a coffee pot in place. As soon as the coffee pot is set under the basket it wobbles around and it ""lifts"" up some from the spot it should be in. Sometimes thats fine, then sometimes you go to get coffee and you find all the coffee grounds all over the coffee pot and counterspace. A big mess on occasion. I've had Mr Coffee's before and never seen this problems, so maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Coffee tastes like plastic and clock doesn't work,"I've had this coffee maker for several years but rarely use it. As others have noted, the clock doesn't work, but the most important thing you should know is that it makes your coffee taste like plastic, even after years! Yuck! N.B. I did not purchase this coffee maker from Amazon. If I had, I'm sure Amazon would have been great about a return. I just wanted to caution any potential buyers of the product."
1,Sad effort at a coffee maker,"Hard to believe that a society capable of such engineering marvels as post-it notes and leatherman pocket multi-tools can't work out a decent coffee maker. A cynic might suggest that these units are designed to be unsatisfying to the user - after all, why sell a unit that lasts 10 years when you can have the customer back in 6 months?So we've owned this unit for 6 months, and here are the highlights:- carafe drips when you pour- pour n' serve function barely slows the flow of coffee onto the warming plate- pump is failing - takes a half hour to grunt out a pot- carafe is permanently etched with coffee stains. We've owned many coffee makers over the years, with various failings, but at least we could keep them clean - not this one.As a disclaimer, we own the 12 cup version of this coffee maker, which (for some strange reason) is no longer available. From the picture, the smaller unit looks exactly the same, so I imagine would have the same failings.The search continues."
3,Holes in back drip water,It is a nice small coffee maker but the holes in the back drip water out and is annoying and bad design engineering.Otherwise is is a good maker for the money.
1,Looking for it's replacement....,"This thing is ready for the trash. I have owned it for several months and about once a week, the filter folds over during the brewing process and all the coffee grounds go to the pot. NICE! I also agree with the previous review about pouring and spilling."
2,hard to read display,"My old coffeemaker like this one had a minor problem (the clock didn't keep the exact time) but I could live with that easily. It broke after several years, so I ordered a new one to replace it, however the new model is far inferior. Besides the minor clock problem, the display (including the clock) is not lighted as it was in the earlier model and the new display is very difficult for me to read because it is black lettering on a grey background. Also the lid on the new coffee pot doesn't open very wide, and it doesn't stay open. Finally, the lid to the new machine is hard to close and keep closed. The new unit works, but I don't like it at all. However, if you never use the clock or delay feature and you just use it as a coffeemaker, it should be fine."
2,new design,The previous machine was much better with the swing out basket. This basket is hard to use. It wobbles around and as a result the top lid is difficult to close. This machine is definitely not as good as my old Mr. Coffee 4 cup unit. I do not like it.
2,Leaks water everywhere,"For the first year that I had this pot I loved it. The coffee tastes great, is nice and hot, and I love the timer. Now it leaks about 2 T of water through the bottom as it makes the coffee. This is my 2nd straight Mr Coffee product which has developed this problem, although the last one lasted 3 years before it happened. My next coffee pot will be a Sanyo."
4,Worth the money,"This works just fine and certainly doesn't take up much space on the counter. The only drawback I can see is that the lid doesn't come off ( or if it does, I still haven't figure out how to do it) and this make it a little harder to wash. I really like the coffee pot."
3,Worth the price,I experienced the same plastic taste for about the first week of use that other customers have mentioned (and yes I ran water through it about 5 times prior to using). After a week the plastic taste went away. I'm only giving it 3 stars b/c the coffee pot fell over and the lid broke. It did not fall from the counter or anything...it literally fell over when i placed it half on a cutting board by accident and broke one of the spikes off for the lid. I have to balance the lid on each time I use it now. Had the lid not broken so easy I'd give it a 4-5 star review.
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this coffeemaker in January 2011. It broke last week. The water stays in the reservoir. I only use this coffeemaker on the weekends. I really expected a little more use than that. I went on the website to locate an authorized repair shop. I called the one nearest to me,which is Howard Beach, only to be disappointed and disgusted by the rude man who answered the phone. I am not wasting my time, gas or energy to go there. I chalk this up to a life lesson. I will be sure to let everyone I know not to buy Mr. Coffee coffeemakers."
2,"Cute, but tiny","Works well, at least so far. Only complaint is that it is smaller than I'd imagined, and it is not really four cups. I actually measured out four cups to put in the pot, and the fourth one overflowed. It looks nice, however, is tiny, and I have no complaints about the coffee. Holds about two normal-sized coffee cups."
1,plastic smell problem,"I followed the directions when I opened the box and ran water through the coffeemaker before using. The smell in the house was horrific! It took me a minute to figure out it was coming from the coffeemaker. How can they sell a new coffeemaker that smells so bad when it heats water? After about 20 pots of coffee and several water cleanings, the coffee still tastes bad . . . plastic smell and little coffee smell for the amount of coffee I used. The unit is cute, but it misses the mark on making a good cup of coffee."
4,Back to Basics - 12 cup Mister Coffee,"We had been using Hamilton Beach brew station coffee makers for years. They are great because they do not have a carafe. You just press your cup against a lever and it fills with coffee. BUT they always developed leaks within 2 years.When our last one gave out, we decided to go back to basics and get a Mister Coffee. We have the 12 cup. It is great.It keeps the coffee much warmer than the Hamilton Beach did, because the carafe sits on the hot plate. The coffee tastes great. We have not had any problem with it dripping on the counter.I wish they would have designed the basket so that it had a flat bottom to make it easier to fill on the counter.I definitely recommend this coffee maker!"
5,good coffee for 1-2 people,"A good machine so far. 4 cups brews about 20oz of coffee which is perfect for me. I have not noticed the plastic taste as some have noted ( I did read the manual and washed the carafe and basket and then run a couple of brew cycles with just water).I also haven't noticed the clock problems some have noted(but I don't really use this as a clock).So far it delivers just the right amount of good tasting coffee to get me started and is super easy to clean(discard grounds, rinse carafe and basket)."
1,Fourth One in Six Months,"I once had this model and it worked fine for quite a while. Then I got a new one when the carafe broke and it did not work at all. Got a replacement which worked fine for about two-three months. Now it is does not work at all. I have checked the manual but none of their suggestions works. I feel like I have the coffee maker curse. In any case, I will not be buying another of this model or brand. Too many coffee makers in the landfills :(!ADDED 11/01/12 Another not even one month old just died. I am so DONE with Mr. Coffee."
1,Sucks,I have to use a ton of coffee to make it any good. Or I turn it on with just water and the lid open and let it run till it makes constant noise. Then I add coffee and let it work. I guess the water doesn't get very hot so the coffee comes out weak. Also the lid flexes when the coffee maker is on and it opens while brewing. All in all STAY AWAY
4,"Makes fine coffee, programmable","I have to admit I cannot read the lcd time window without my glasses because it is too dim, so if I want to use the programmable feature I have to be careful that I have not inadvertently hit a button that has changed the time. That is pretty easy to do. No problem with the coffee-making, and I like being able to program it...just be careful because one tap on a button when you move the coffee maker and you may change the time...and it is kind of hard to read."
2,failed after 10 months,"It was fine until it suddenly failed one morning. We poured our coffee as usual, turned it off, and it was just blank and dead when we tried to brew with it a few hours later. 10 months is beyond the warranty. VERY disappointed in MR. COFFEE brand quality."
5,Great Everyday Wine Glasses,"These wine glasses are great for everyday. They are under 7"" tall so they fit easily standing up in your dishwasher and they don't break as easily as thinner wine glasses."
2,Natural Dyes from Native American Plants,"I am returning this pamphlet, as it is too narrow in subject. It talks about plants of the Southwest, whereas I live on the East Coast. No reflection on the author intended, as it takes a lot of research and work to produce a publication, even as small it is."
3,Really Magic?,Out of the stories I've read from this anthology most have been extremely well written and effectively used the magical realist form. Only one story that I've read so far drove me up the wall and felt like I was plowing through dense woods. So far I've enjoyed flipping through these stories.
4,Thoughtful and Fascinating,"This is a book about the experience of sensing not the mechanics of perception... it is philosophy, not science. The basis of the book is the idea that most people move quickly on from sensing the world to interpreting it, but that autistic people either remain in the sensing stage or never quite fully let go of it. I identified with a lot of the thoughts and experiences related here and found it interesting and enjoyable to read. I think there are many people who might not 'get' where this is coming from though... from those who do not understand her philosophical approach and mistake it for bad science to those who take every word literally and mistake this for a book about the paranormal. This isn't a book suitable for everybody, but if you have enjoyed Donna's other books or are in to self analysis and exploration I think you'll find this delicious."
5,Packed full of food for thought,"Interesting, interesting, interesting. I have, as far as I know, no characteristics related to autism, but I am truely amazed at Donna's excellent ability to describe the varioius ""shifts"" in perception related to her autism. Thank goodness she has the ability to describe her experiences so that people might better understand autism, and the workings of the human brain in general. I can especially relate to her description of ""lemon-ness"" (you have to read the book - too difficult for me to paraphrase here). This little book, as one other reviewer mentioned, is packed full of insight. Thanks, Donna, for an excellent read."
3,GOOD AND INTRESTING,THIS BOOK IS VERY DIFFERNT FORM DONNAS OTHER BOOKS.IN HERE SHE GIVES A THEROY ABOUT AUTISM. I DONT KNOW IF IS TRUE OTR NOT BUT IT REALLY IS INTRESTING. THE BOOK IS NOT THE EASYEST READ INT HE WORLD THOUGH. SOME PARTS ARE VERY DISCPICTIVE IN PSYCOLGOLY. AND SOME PARTS ALMOST SEEMS LIKE PHILSOPY.
4,Typical Wodehouse Greatness,"This, the last Jeeves and Wooster tale, is a worthy swan song for Wodehouse's most famous characters. Also published as ""The Cat-Nappers"", the story revolves around Aunt Dahlia's plan to nobble a racehorse by kidnapping its feline companion. A forgetful African explorer and an unwelcome engagement further complicate Bertie's world just when his doctor urges him to adopt a more simple and relaxed lifestyle.This is the one Jeeves story I hadn't read and I've really been looking forward to getting my hands on this book. I wasn't disappointed. While it's not an indisputable masterpiece like ""The Code of the Woosters"" or ""Joy in the Morning"", it kept me giggling all evening.I know I say it in all my Wodehouse reviews, but if you are looking for smart humor and clever word play, look no farther than the Collectors Wodehouse series. Pelham Grenville Wodehouse is the master of English comedic literature.4.5 stars."
4,"Laugh Out Loud, As Usual","It never gets tiresome reading about good ol bertie wooster and jeeves. This time, Bertie is on a trip to the country to heal his young man about town symtoms.Appearances by old friends, and of course, his aged relative (aunt dahlia) are a source of amusement to the reader. You've got wit and humor, as with all woosterbooks.Bertie talks to you, as with all his books, and his mannerisms are definitely stitch inducing."
5,A superlative theoretical synthesis,"This is one of the three most stimulating books I've read in the last 20 years. Mann posits civilizations as overlapping networks of power -- ideological, military, economic, and political. He described the extensive and intensive capabilites of each type of network from place to place over time, and is pretty good about minimizing any Eurocentrism, though there is room for improvement.Although written in an intensely academic style -- not a book for the faint of heart or the short of attention span -- it will well reward the considered reader."
5,My 7 and 5 year old grandchildren loved the game,"During the holidays I visited my grandchildren and gave them this game. They loved the game morning, noon and nighttime. They even preferred the game over the high tech computer/television based games they recently received as birthday and Christmas gifts.I spoke with their mom this month and they're still playing the game regularly. My 7-year old grandson has improved his attention and listening skills too by using/playing the game. I'm a former teacher and highly recommend this game; it's actually fun for adults and would be excellent for elderly folks too that need to sharpen up their memory skills."
3,This is an awesome piece of japanimaton by Go Nagai,"This is a smart and really neat piece of japanimation.The story is of Shishimaru of the Iga ninja prefecture in 1590 Japan.lord Nobunaga Oda(ancient japanese warord)has destroyed most of the prefectures around the nation of Japan.i know what you are thinking typical ninja medival samurai stuff.Well...you are right,but..Lord Nobunaga's army has the most technological and out of this world military force thte world has ever seen,far greater then our technology today.Not only this he has allied himself with the immortal ninja killer Ginnai Doma,whom no one can destroy.Shishimaru's iga ninja squad has been wiped out by this evil monster of a man and he know has made killing Ginnai personal!This is a good anime with plenty of violence for the ultimate anime fan or those who have started watching it."
5,"It had fantasy, drama , action, and great art work all in 1.","This is a very well laid out anime. i loved every minute of it. it has fantasy, action, and drama all rolled into one. It shows the love, and respect that orientals have for loved ones."
2,Nostaliga only-poor transfer,The mp3 download offered here is from an LP record in bad condition. The first two tracks even skip!Didn't anyone listen to this before uploading.Aside from that it's ok.
1,Save Time - Buy the vinyl and transfer it yourself!,Terrible transfer problems including pop/crackel and numerous skipping issues.I was hoping for a clean version of this recording and was only able to hear the nasty skips and poor dubbing job AFTER spending the $$$ and downloading.....Save $ and buy the real record.
1,Originals Are Better,Classics are called that for a reason and this album tries to redo them and sell to whomever. I want the tracks I heard growing up not these with a different vocalist. I don't know the history of Foreigner but the difference in sound makes these hard to listen to.
2,Can't copy an original,"Kelly Hanson is a good replacement for Lou Gramm--but he's not Lou Gramm. I have no idea why Mick Jones wants to put out new renditions of these songs since he already did that with Hanson's first recording with the band. The only thing worth mentioning is the price of $5.00 for the CD, but save yourself the trouble and find one of the half dozen Greatest Hits albums the group already produced with the great Lou Gramm at the mic."
5,Zyliss Mini Salad Spinner,It is just the right size for a small dinner salad.I hope they never change the style! It works great!
3,Making a So So Shaver Better,"I have been using this shaver for about a year and it wasn't giving me a very close shave. My father recommended that I try Williams Lectric Shave. I don't know what that stuff does, but I now get a shave almost as smooth as a blade.If you do have this shaver, you can make your own solution instead of the refill kits from Braun:* denatured alcohol* Singer sewing machine oil,* McCormick pure lemon extract, This is optional. You'll need this if you want your razor to have that lemony fresh smell. Be sure to get extract, not lemon juice. Lemon extract is an oil made from the skins.Directions:Rinse the empty cartridge with water. I don't bother to completely clean it out. Just rinse it a few times, then let it dry.1/2 teaspoon lemon extract.1/2 teaspoon machine oil.5 3/4 oz of alcohol.I mix it in a little pitcher with a screw on top that I bought at Wal*Mart. After I shake it up, I pour it into the Braun cleaning cartridge."
3,Worked fine... until the on/off switch stopped working,"I used it for a year or so, but then one day it justwouldn't turn off. It ran until the battery died.Now it won't charge. Waah![Edit] After a month or so or charging, it magically started working again.Pressing the hidden reset button at the bottom front seems to help sometimes.This has happened three times so far, and it just happened again - it's buzzing its little heart out, and there's nothing I can do; pressing OFF or RESET doesn't help. I'm not looking forward to being without a razor again for however many days it takes to regain its sanity."
2,"Dulls quickly, cleaning is a gimic, can't find parts",* fastest dulling blade I've ever owned* can't find replacement screen / cleaning solution anywhere* noisy during cleaning cycle* quit working after 1 year
2,The produce was great but it was shipped twice and Amazon gives you no way to talke to a person about it.,"The product was just as advertised. I was happy with it but it was shipped to me twice. Amazon gives you no way to talk to a person about it and did not give an option of why it was being returned, shipped twice etc. The options given only allow it to be returned prepaid shipping, this is wrong to me. In the future I will make every effort to find an item else where before purchasing from Amazon."
4,WESTERNS,"EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN, BUT QUITE GRAPHIC AND A BIT MORE VIOLENCE THAN I LIKE, BUT REALISTIC AS TO THE UNLAWFUL TIMES IN THE WEST."
4,A fine introduction to Tibetan Buddhist practices,"Ole Nydahl became a Buddhist lama after studying under H.H. the 16th Karmapa in the early seventies. Ever since he has opened the world of Buddhism to the west and has founded hundreds of Buddhist centres around the world. In this book he shares his immense experience with the reader, and introduces the so-called Four Foundational Practices. These are specific meditations that are employed as the preliminary practice in order to prepare the body and mind for more advanced studies. Each exercise must be repeated 111,111 times (usually over a number of years) to reap the full benefit. The book is interesting and worthwhile for Buddhists as well as for anyone interested in understanding the basic practices of Tibetan Buddhism."
3,Sex Pistols-Punk Rockers,THIS DVD IS PRETTY WELL THE EXACT SAME THING AS THE LIVE AT THE LONGHORN DVD. ITS A PRETTY GOOD CONCERT FOR ANY SEX PISTOLS FAN. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU GET THE LIVE AT THE LONGHORN DVD INSTEAD BUT THIS IS ALSO A GREAT SEX PISTOLS ITEM. THERE IS A GREAT RARE TRACK BELSON IS A GAS ON THE SONG LIST SO THATS WORTH IT ALL.
1,Helpful Review,"So, I bought this because this was the cheapest one I found. I had a single betta to test it out, and everything went fine. Until the next morning he was over in the last compartment. He jumped over the two dividers, I was so mad because what if I had another male betta in the other compartments, my betta would have been dead. Then I decided that I would my betta out of the security house and put another one in his place. Somehow he lifted the bottom up and got out. So I had two male betta's in one tank, so scary. I finally got him out with no fighting. I am returning this product and getting a refund. I am buying another one which looks more secure than this one."
2,Won't stay Stuck to Side,"I bought this & removed the dividers so it was one large separate enclosure. I had my male betta in it with a tank full of females. He was happy enough while it stayed attached to the side of the tank (all of about 30 minutes). After that, the suction cups came disconnected and females came in while he got out. Luckily I was right there or it could have had a very poor outcome for all the fish. Maybe if you can find a way to keep the suction cups attached it would be worth it. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
1,My Betta's are dead ='( useless!!!!,"I'm so mad, this is a poor product the plastic compartment does not sit properly against the aquarium glass so there are gaps. I press the suctions cups as hard as a i could to eliminate the gap but over time they loose their suction. Needless to it is easy for fishes to escape which is what happened to mine. I have a 55 gallon fish tank and wanted this so i can start a female Betta fish colony, i bought 4 all female Betta fishes and wanted to put them on the Betta house before letting them out to the tank. The first night two got out, one killed the other one, so i had three left, the second night two of them got out again and another one got killed so now i have two left...........I'M SO MAD!!!!!!!! don't get this product bottom line it would not hold your fish."
1,BETTA HOUSE WITH 4 COMPARTMENTS,I BOUGHT TWO AND WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY THEY DON'T STICK TO THE SIDES AND EVEN FOR THE SHORT TIME THEY DO THE BETTAS CAN SLIDE OUT. NEVER AGAIN
4,"Great sampler from the ""Tennessee Plowboy""",The living legend Eddy Arnold has recorded for RCA for over 50 years. This cd showcases some of eddy's best. From pure country to pop country. Some hard to find tunes at a nice price!!!
5,This is THE best intro book on Cisco routers,"Out of all the books I've bought to study for my CCNA, this book is the best. The writing style and presentation are enjoyable, not dry or overwhelming. The examples and screenshots are worthwhile and informative. Almost every page has a ""blue box"" sidebar that is worth reading, giving good information, not just trivial tidbits. One of the best things about this book is the attention given to entering router commands, especially what prompt/mode you need to be in. Almost every command example is given within the context of ""at this prompt"" or ""in this mode"". It's a stress-saver. Other books just say ""do this"". I would highly recommend this book for everyone who wants to learn about Cisco routers or is studying for their CCNA."
4,japanese wood joints,"the book is a concise introduction to japanese woodwork. The tools, their care as well as the different joints used in japaneseb house construction are explained. thje book makes a good addition to any woodworkers library."
2,Be AWARE!!!,"I specialize in Asian, Middle Eastern and Eastern European Timber Framing. I have loved this book for over 20 years, even getting to see originals of the two books this one comes from. I often reference it to students and often reach to it to explain concepts, and that is the rub, this book has so many directional and technical errors, that a lay person, if trying to use the book as a building manual, (as the to original books were intended,) would surly become lost and confused. This has left some of my students running into the night with frustration and confusion, because there is more to what must be done than what ended up in this abridged copy of the original works."
4,Excellent glimpse into Japanese timberframe joinery.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The pics are black and white, but good. I've spent hours reading, and re-reading it. Good resource for carpenters who want to add something to their work or understanding. Also could be great for imaginitive furniture building."
4,TACTICS! TACTICS!,"This is the best chess book you can own and not use a chess board (except for Logical Chess: Move by move by Chernev). A few minutes every day keeps the chess juices flowing and my chess strength is moving up after a 11 year gap of ANY playing. Tough problems? You better believe it but when you work through them, you will find yourself seeing the chess board in a new way! I'm on a U.S. Navy ship and when I'm out to sea, this is the book that I read every night before I turn the light out in my rack. While this book is very short on words, read those words carefully! Lou Hays gives good advice. Don't see the answer after a while, look it up! Go through the book two or three times and then use it as a refresher book that sits in your reading room!"
2,Paperback binding won't last long with your toddler,I wasn't paying attention to the binding type when I ordered this book. I was surprised when a >paperback< lift the flap book arrived. I returned it immediately as my toddler will destroy this book within a week.
2,Not worth the $,This book is big and like a coloring book. It is easy to rip and clumsy to handle. Do yourself and your little one a favor and buy another book.
3,Enjoyable Wacky comedy,"""Shaadi Se Pehle"" was slated by the critics. I however feel that it has worked as a wacky comedy, there were some scenes which made me howl with laughter. Akshaye Khanna flits through his comedy scenes but does not suit the serious side of his role. Ayesha Takia, the firebrand newcomer, is perfect in her role. She is especially good in her last song. Aftab Shivdeasani and Sunil Shetty give sterling performances, and for once are not wasted in a film. The story may be stilted but it does allow for some hilarious scenes. Mallika Sherawat begins well and then levels off to being average. Overall the film was average enjoyable comedy, that will win no awards, but watch it for some laughs!"
2,forgetful... except for Suniel Shetty's performance,"For the movie as a whole I give this movie ZERO stars! None of the performances (except one) were noteworthy.The only highlight was Suniel Shetty's performance as the menacing yet lovable mafia don (my 2 stars go to him exclusively; he really deserves 5 stars though but I unfortunately have to consider the movie as a whole when rating it). Not only did he look stylish and sexy with his longer hair and shades, but he carried off the part with such wit and charm! Really refreshing! (I bookmark and watch just his scenes and forget the rest). I feel really bad that his performance couldn't have been part of a 'hit' movie and was instead wasted on this 'flop'."
5,Wonderful Book!!,This book is helpful for people inquiring about the breed. It lists breeders all over the country. It is also helpful for breeders. Wonderful Job Sharon!!!
2,Spice Rack Review,"The metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication. Somewhat flimsy. I do not expect it to last long. Nice concept, but I wish they had used better materials!"
4,An engaging chronicle of a unique urban environment.,"Pittsburgh is a city of surprises, most of them positive for out-of-towners. This book capably explains how the city became what it once was and what it now is.Although the author is an academic (Professor of Architecture at Pitt) the writing style is reasonably warm and pleasant. Tales of individual buildings and neighbourhoods are told with passion and a precise eye for landscape and cityscape. There are more places celebrated in this history than people, but that's for another volume I suppose.There are illustrations aplenty and the book is a marvelous guide for anyone who wants to explore one of North America's truly unique urban environments."
3,Innappropriately Titled,"If this book had been titled Pittsburgh: an Architectural Portrait I may well have rated it at 5 stars. Of course, had it been titled such, I probably wouldn't of picked it up. It was not until I read a previous reviewers comments that I understood the inclination of the author to include extreme architectural details of many specific buildings in Pittsburgh. I found myself wading through much of the architectural descriptions searching for other points of interest. Had I been reading the book from the point of view of a student of architecture, I'm sure I would of found the book interesting. Instead I found much of it tedious. I did find the historical and social commentary interesting but lacking, leaving me feeling wanting more, which is why I sought such a book in the first place."
2,too many accessories needed,"We purchased this blimp expecting it to be a no nonsense remote control toy. It requires you purchase HELIUM seperately, ( at least $20.00), and special batteries found only at radio shack or on the internet. It was a last minute scramble to have all the operating tools to have it ready for Christmas morning!! Thank God I took it out of the box and read the directions BEFORE wrapping!! It is huge and only an indoor toy, so if you live in cramped quarters forget it!"
5,Beautiful and Informative !!!,"American Women Modernists...was stunningly beautiful, and contains fresh information, including many illustrations, about a long over-looked topic.I particularly liked the extensive listing of ""Artists' Biographies"", and the very helpful ""Notes sections. The nine-page Bibliography is an excellent resource for those of us interested in learning about so many talented contributors to American art.A ""must-read"" for all art collectors!"
3,A lot of information and very nice pictures,"Frank Sellers mentions the Freund brothers in his book ""Sharps Firearms"" so when I learned that I could get this book here through Amazon I decided to do so.The chapters (I've only started to read the book)cover the various time periods that one or both brothers had a gun business. There seems to be quite a bit of history, lots of examples of patents, advertisement copies, even a few examples of their product catalogs.I find some of the layout to be confusing (the color picture section refers to chapter 12 but is at the front of the book- its hard to keep track of item#'s and descriptions, the catalog copies are interesting but confusing the way they are presented).There are a lot of photographs and patent diagrams, these are much better than what Mr. Sellers has in his book. It's worth owning if you're a fan of the Sharps rifle."
1,Avoid at ALL COSTS,"The vendor - Hastings - are not just liars and theives, they are sneaks. They were unable to send me the product I bought so, instead of emailing an option or refunding my costs, they tried to sneak an inferior product past me. I ordered a 5-DVD set, and they sent a 3-DVD set with very similar graphics and content, hoping I wouldn't notice. I know this is so because they appended no comment to that effect in the area reserved for such advice on their invoice. They tried to cheat, and got caught.I wouldn't deal with this company again unless my life depended on it, and advise all other Amazon users to adopt the same attitude."
2,"thriller every second in I & II, III is OK but IV is a loser",Bought the collection because I wanted to have III and IV. III is not as bad as IV. I wouldn't recommend buying the collection. Buy I and II and skip III and IV. That's why I give the collection two stars for I and II.
5,GREAT!!!,All discs came in the mail on time and they all worked great. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,Good seller,"I bought a compilation disk set of dvd's. Quality was good price was right seller should (will) be looked for further purchases. Mom and Pop quality, because they can and will. well done good luck."
2,Squeezing juice out of a juiced out name ....,The first two movies are the regular big budget movies worth buying.... the next two are small budget... just sharing the name of the franchise....Would not recommend the series..... A purchase i repent...
4,Species Collection,It just arrived and I haven't watched the movie yet.I also hate when it is required on how many words I have to say to rate a product.
5,A must for the complete DVD collection,"Anyone who has the Predator series and the Alien series, must have the Species collection. I also have a few other collections that are not as closely related, but these three concepts are the best of the 'other worldly' maximum bad aliens. I actually believe the best acting preformances of all three collections are in the Species set. It is an easy collection to watch, like I do, annually. It doesn't get old."
5,Amusing Beautifully Written Tale!,"Don't miss this one! Mainly about the lives of school girls in modern England, with enough eccentrics and quirks to keep you smiling throughout, with nice Mozartian references, not to mention PG Wodehouse, ""The Leopard"", Oxford, aging hippies,and several disorganized, but loving families. The heroine's mixed up love life is mostly amusing, though it does seem to hit a strange wall with the very odd Giavanni at the end. Still, this is miles ahead of most popular fiction out there,and worth re-reading too!"
5,This is a GREAT book,"It's amazing what she does! I'm in awe. Noah's Ark is great too - I'd highly recommend it, and all the others. This one is my favorite."
5,I can't believe it is no longer in print,"This is one of my all-time favorite books and I think it's such a shame that it is no longer in print. It is a very 1970's book but it's beautifully illustrated by Hilary Knight (of ""Eloise"" fame) and the story is wonderful. Angie is a clever, quirky young girl who doesn't always fit into her world just right, and does not always act as she is expected to act due to her overactive imagination but she always means well. The ""lessons"" in the story are not overly preachy at all. Angie also has a pet goose. I adored this book as a little girl named Angie myself, and thirty years later I still love it. I was so pleased to find a copy on Amazon."
5,Best Socks Ever,These are the best socks I ever bought. They really keep your feet dry. I know own them in almost every style from dress to athletic. Worth the price. I've only had them for a short time so I hope they last a long time.
3,"Thinner, not as nice","these are thinner, and less comfortable than the originals. better than many socks, but not worth the price with this new version. i bought 4 pair, and returned them to nordstrom. they made the balls of my feet warm because they are to thin, and my feet seemed to slide more within the sock? whatever it was, it wasn't good. nordstrom said others had similar comments. hopefully smartwool with get a clue and go back to the original game plan. if they wanted a thinner sock for dress shoes, then they should advertise this as that sock, not try to play it off as a new and improved version of the original."
3,Older Model Expedition Watch,This is an older model watch. It doesn't run on a long life lithium battery and doesn't have Indiglo to light up the watch face. Otherwise it's a fine watch.
5,Mom loved it,This was a birthday gift for my mother. Her shades were falling apart and they were just right for her lamps as replacements. Thanks!!
4,Good deal,The kettle always remains cool to the touch and the water boils quickly.It's a good kettle and the price was right.
2,average stuff,"For the price,..this stuff should do a better job of detangling and conditioning at the same time. I have a $3 bottle of detangler that does the same job. I had hoped this would be a whole lot better."
5,Horton Hears A Waldrop!,"The problem with books likes this is that publishers always try to squeeze them into some kind of recognizable category. In this case, the usual well-worn descriptions of ""fantasy"" or ""science fiction"" were avoided, but only in favor of the ambiguous genre of ""speculative fiction."" It's still a rough fit for Waldrop. This guy has an imagination that defies imagination. All of these are true short stories, worthy of any contemporary analysis. ""Ike At The Mike"" is *the* best alternative history story I've ever read. ""The Ugly Chickens"" is nothing short of brilliant and startling in its examination of lost possibilities. ""Heirs Of The Perisphere"" is heartrending in its utter simplicity. Perhaps the best recommendation of all, I met Waldrop in San Antonio in 1988, and I was duely impressed by his genuine humility and straightforwardness. He wrote this on the title page of my copy: ""Thanks for finding the book. Hope you enjoy it."" I pass that recommendation on to you."
1,Not A Pure Anise Extract At All. Content 92% Alcohol.,"I am really disappointed by this product. Star Kay White claim to sale 4 oz of Pure Anise Extract. In fact it is 92% alcohol and only 8% Star anise oil. when you buy this product you are buying 3.68 oz of alcohol and only .32 oz of Anise Extract .The product is weak and diluted, not good for my uses. I don't need the alcohol.If you call it pure is must be pure 100% or change the label and publish the details on the site to reflect the true content of the products you sale.Thanks for reading.Michel Gerard"
3,Good but real missleading.,"I have seen all 6 dvds and this was an enjoyable series. I wouldnt buy it unless you can get a good deal on it though. I bought mine used so it was worth it to me. I would however be dissapointed if I had to pay full price for this series since its not good enough to spend that kind of money on. Dont be fooled by the covers, the series has no such outfits or weapons for the characters I dont know why they used such missleading covers. Basically the series is about a giant god (Ranga) who is controlled by 3 sisters and is seen as a media icon, they have news broadcasts, TV specials and souveniers about Ranga. The city hates Ranga at one moment then they love him the next depending on what good or bad deed he does. There is a whole revival of ancient gods thing going on too, as you can guess Ranga has to fight the different revived gods. Dont want to give away any of the story, buy only if you can get it cheap."
5,disco goes to heaven,"This was a true find. It's rare to hear music that has the courage to sound at once spiritual and groovy, romantic and disembodied, melancoly and blissful, goofy and refined, fun and poetic (luckily, it seems to be happening more often these days). Polar's main musical influences are disco and classical music, which he combines in an unlikely and magical mix that has nothing of the cheesiness of similar efforts by other musicians. My personal favorites are ""In Time"" and ""Matter into Energy"". It sounds like the work of a beautiful mind..."
5,What a Great Inspiration!!!!,Ellen's book of great daily affirmations has continued to inspire and motivate me on a daily basis.I heartily endorse this great little book as a way to remind yourself and others on how to really Make It A Big Day!
3,The Fantastic Book of Logic Puzzles,"This book would be a very good book for a teacher to read aloud to her kids as a starter for the day. The questions are pretty hard, but they're nice in that they get you thinking. It's a pretty good book."
2,Madelung Solid-state theory,The book by Ashcroft and Mermin provides definitely a more didactic introduction into this subject.
3,Hardly Explicit.,"For some reason this got tagged as having explicit lyrics. There is one song entitled ""Ain't That A Bitch"" which contains the word ""bitch"" and some mild marijuana references. It's not exactly death metal or gangsta rap. The subject matter is dealt with in a nostalgic way and does not offer a pro-drug message at all. Quite possibly the contrary. I imagine just containing the word ""bitch"" makes this explicit to some people, but prime time television contains languege at least this offensive but nobody is calling the DVDs of ""Two And A Half Men"" explicit. Just saying. Otherwise it's a collection of decent little songs recorded on a shoestring budget."
4,Great Study Aides,"These Flash Cards and accompanied CD were quite helpful in preparing to take the A+ exam. As long as you keep in mind that they are for test preparation and not for substituting an A+ book. They provided questions that paralleled those on the exams. They also tell you why the right answers are right and the wrong ones are wrong. In addition, many of the cards provide additional tips that are very useful. I highly recommend them as study aides."
3,"Cards OK, software has problems","If you're looking for quick test prep, the flash cards are OK. If you are able to go beyond the cards and study the subject rather than just memorize the answers on the cards you should do fine. The sample test on the CD has problems. On my first time through the sample test I found no less than three answers that were absolutely incorrect. There are definitely better study packages available, and I found that I was best served by using several different test prep packages together."
5,"Stops UTIs ~ No antibiotics required, if strike immediately",I learned the value of CranActin after two expensive visits to the ER in the middle of the night with my wife.
4,"Good, but could be better","I purchased a bottle of this rose extract from Kalustyan's, a specialty store in NYC. It is good, but not the best rose extract on the market. I suspect it is best for adding a mild, secondary flavor to delicate dishes, like another reviewer's rose ice cream.I used it to add to simple syrup for cocktails, and to add to seltzer. I find it has a soapy flavor when used in anything but the most minute amounts. This is common for many floral extracts, but it was more potent here than in others I've worked with. This should be fine if you're making lemon-rose or vanilla-rose or cardamom-rose cream dishes, but you may be disappointed with stand-alone flavor.I prefer the rose extract made by Silver Cloud Estates. It's about 3x more expensive, but worth it."
5,I'm a Wanna Be Saving Grace,"I picked up this book because of the picture of 2 chairs on the cover, a subject I can never pass up. What a delightful read! I was the 5th member of this group, I knew these women. It's a story of friendship between unlikely characters, each adding her own personality to the mix. I wanted to shake Rudy and tell her to get a clue about her manipulative husband. GRRRRRR I loved each one in spite of flaws, just like I love my own circle of women friends. Don't pass this one up."
4,Great book - could not put it down!,This book is a must for every woman who treasures her friends. The book celebrates women and the close bond that only women can understand. Gaffney is a wonderful writer -- her characters come to life! Her vivid storytelling allows the reader to be transported from the armchair to the lives of the four Graces. Many of the lines in the book resonanted with me long after I finished reading the story.
4,Female Bonding,What an incredible story. This is the story of four women friends that meet every two weeks for ten years. Each chapter is told by one of the four women. This made me feel as though each woman was sitting in my living room with me and talking to me. They became my friends. It is a story of friendship and caring. I could see bits of myself and my friends in these women. It made me laugh out loud and it made me cry. I have recommended this book to numerous women friends and they have each loved it. I wish I could find another book that touches on the strength and depth of female friendships. Thank you Patricia Gaffney for giving this story to me.
4,Great Story but wish I read it when I was a little older,"There is no question that this book is terrific. It has a great plot and charectors one can identify with. The beginning is a little slow but picks a lot around page 100. Being 21 however I could not relate to a lot of the topics that are discussed in this book. If you are in your early 20's try reading ""Summer Sisters"" by Judy Blume."
1,Save your money,"I must be the only one who didn't like this book. The characters were fairly well developed, but completely boring. This book is about a group of four women whose friendship supports them through the pitfalls of life. Only one of the women (the cancer patient) has any backbone. The others seem to be incapable of confronting and solving their problems. Reviewers have called this book emotion packed. I failed to find much emotion here. Instead it was filled with whiny, boring women. It drips with everything you see in a daytime soap. I finished this book only because I bought it in hardcover. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I'll give this one away to the library. My husband thinks I should drop it in the nearest dumpster."
4,What a surprise,"I got this book because of the good reviews listed at this web site. But, when I started to read it, it was a little slow. I'm glad I got into it. There was alot of background information that had to be revealed before the storylines really started. But when they started, I was hooked. I love how this book is presented: from the points of view of four friends, all in first person, all with their own alternating chapters. A very unique perspective, because they discuss alot of the same situations and you really get to see how differently these women think and percieve these things. I really recommend this book. You really will come away with a whole new attitude."
3,4 different voices? - NOT,"I liked this book, I really did. The story of the 4 women and their friendship over the years was wonderful and made me long for some of the friends I have lost contact with over the years. you know the ones, those you see again after months or years and it is like you were just together yesterday. That is what the Saving Graces reminded me of.BUT...Ms Gaffney's attempt to have the story told by the 4 main characters in their own voices failed. It was impossible to tell the characters apart without looking to see the title of the chapter. It was very confusing until you got to know the characters.That said, I would recommend this book to other readers and if I needed someting to read I wouldn't hesitate to read it again."
5,"real, can relate to characters, good pace, recommend",I especially liked the variety in the characters and the unexpected twists in their stories and the interactions which rang true. Excellent dialogue.
3,"Disappointing, stereotypical read","I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. The reviews here made it sound like it was a great read, and I thought it would be good pick for my book club. This book turned out to be a ""beach read"" just as someone else here pointed out."
4,"A Lovely ""Chick"" Book...","I won't reiterate the basic plot, since it's been done in previous reviews...I've always been partial to first-person narrative, so this book was right up my alley. Gaffney was very effective in producing a unique voice for each of the characters. I was able to relate to each of them in a different way: Emma's cynicism, Rudy's insecurity, Isabel's peacefulness, and Lee's practical sense. I also enjoyed how these differences affected the characters' interactions with each other.At the same time, I felt that some parts were cliched in this book - which resulted in predictibility at points.This is definitely a book for anyone who appreciates stories about relationships, friendships, and women helping women. I would definitely read another book by Patricia Gaffney."
4,The Saving Graces,"The true test of a great book for me is 1.) I read it too late into the evening/early morning 2.) I can't want to share it with my mother,daughter, sister and best firend and 3.) I can't put the story out of my mind. The Saving Graces met all three criteria. Enjoy and share it with a friend."
4,I laughed and cried!,"This is the exact type of book I absolutely love to read. Four women with the best friendship, and four women with a different set of problems. I laughed with them and cried with them, I feel like I'm right in there with them. You've gotta get this book!"
2,Saving Graces not so Graceful...,"Our book club of 5 women read this book and while we appreciated the topic and idea, from beginning to end this book was VERY predictable. The book was too long and too melodramatic. If you enjoy soap operas and romance novels, you may like this piece of work.We were bored and frustrated by the storyline and the lack of character development. You knew what these women were like ONLY because she came out and said it directly, not leaving any room for imagination. There was nothing that stood out about these women. On to greener pages...."
2,A tidy little bundle,"I finished this book in a short period of time only because I had to for a book club meeting. Otherwise it would have stayed upon my shelf waiting for me to have nothing better to read. I may have never become that desperate. Sappy and needy women abound throughout the pages. In the end, all story lines are wrapped up in a very romance novel - like pattern. I should note that most of the women in my bookclub actually ""really liked"" this book."
3,A Book About Friends - probably a good choice for a book club!,"This is a middle-of-the-road chick lit novel targeted more towards middle-aged or older readers than the younger end of the market. The story revolves around four friends. It's a bit reminscient ofSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Gift Set), at times, but handled with more maturity and a lot less humour. It was entertaining enought and it was nice how each chapter came from a different P.O.V. It may make for good book for a book club, since it dealt with a lot of issues that would spark conversations. I just wasn't that impressed, or attached to any of the characters."
5,Couldn't put it down.,"I loved it! Gaffney did a great job with the unusual format. If you like relationship stories with 'real' characters you'll love it too. My only complaint was her use of the word ""darling"" twice."
4,A Great Book About Women,"The Saving Graces is a warm heartfelt book. By the end of the book you feel as if you personally know all the characters. A little hard to fallow at the beginning. Each chapter is suposed to be told by a different character, but the writting is always the same so it took a while to figure out who was who."
3,"Perhaps twenty years from now, I can relate...","Are you over 40? Married or divorced? Ever had an affair? Trouble getting pregnant? If you answered ""no"" to most of these questions, this book may not interest you. As a young twenty-something, I had trouble relating to these four women's lives. I admit, I admired the friendship between these ladies. The book even made me cry. The Saving Graces seemed to be a melancholy bunch, so why is this novel considered a ""feel-good"" book? I could deal with one or two of the ladies having a bad day, but what about happy times? Is life full of one tragedy after another? I know I'll get slammed for my opinion, but I feel the need to warn my generation. If you're a twenty-something looking for an endearing friendship tale, try Beth Gutcheon's ""The New Girls."""
3,Nothing more than an engaging soap opera,"While there is nothing wrong with an engaging soap opera, I can't agree with all of these five star reviews. The stories of the four women were interesting in the way that All My Children is. But all of these women were going through terrible experiences, all at the same time, which I found unbelievable and a little tiring after a while. Also the novel is supposed to be told by four different women, but the narrative seemed to be told by the same person in four different moods, which made it difficult to follow at first. The ending also was way, way too pat. All of a sudden, their problems are over. Just a little too simplistic. All that said, I did enjoy it and stayed up until almost midnight last night reading it. It's not quite a guilty pleasure, but it verges on it. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for something substantial, just a light read, perfect for a long plane ride or a weekend away."
3,Typical Mass Market Work,This novel was readable if you keep in mind that is commercial fiction and not literary fiction. Also keep in mind that all the elements of a summer read are here as well.What kept me going was the friendship of the women.
3,Good girlfriend beach read,"This is a good beach read, but it's not always light, so keep that in mind. On the plus side, this might be a good starter book for a book club as it's easy to read, keeps the reader's interest and provides some discussion points that won't ruffle any feathers. It's not too heavy but still thought provoking. On the down side, some of the characters actions didn't ring true, and some were too stereotypical and one dimensional. That being said, if you love the ""small group of female friends who bond together in a crisis"" genre, then you'll like this book."
5,I didn't want it to end!,What a great book! Women will love it! It shows the true bond between women and the strength of their friendships. Enjoy!
3,Only OK,"Wow I'm surprised how many people gave this book 5 stars, I only thought it was so-so. It was interesting and an easy read but I didn't think there was much character development. The only character that stood out was Isabel, the other three kind of melded into one. I kept having to remind myself who was who and I also had to look at the chapter to see who was telling the story at that time. Being from the DC area, it really annoyed me how much she referred to the location of the characters at any given time, ""driving down Rock Creek Parkway"", ""her house in Adams-Morgan"", ""going to the liquor store on Old Georgetown Road"", ""The doctors offices on K street"". It was too much after the 5th Adams-Morgan reference.This book just didn't grab me, but I do have to admit to crying during one point of it which surprised me. Good for reading by the pool."
2,Overrated,"It's hard to imagine a book that has all the essentials of a compelling , involving book and yet so persistently misses the mark. The characters are drawn woodenly, so that when joy or sorrow befalls them it's hard to work up even a hearty interest. There is a conspicuous lack of description, development of scene, anything of literary depth. The four main characters are meant to develop, mature and we are suposed to understand the intracacies of their personalitites and minds. There is little other than external events to distinguish them from one another that even toward the end of the book, I found myself looking back to see who was talking. That all said, it's an easy book to read on the beach."
1,A disappointing read,"I was given this book and told I'd love it. Having a close group of friends that I would trust with my life, I was looking forward to a good read. Was I ever disappointed.The switching of voices between the four main characters was confusing and became irritating as there was very little distinction made between them other than their names. I had to keep jumping back to confirm which ""Grace"" was speaking. It became so tedious that I couldn't even read it during the 1.5 hours I was on line waiting to vote!If you want a good friends-for-life book, stick with the Ya-Ya's!"
2,Audio Version Only!,"Please keep in mind as you read this review I am referring to the audio version only, not to the book itself. I really enjoyed the book. The audio production however, was pretty awful. Not so much the abridgement of the text, but the voice! Judith Ivey may be a Tony Award winner, but that doesn't necessarily make her fit to do audio book readings. I would much prefer to have a reader use the same voice for all characters and narration as opposed to having someone vary their speech and accent, with disasterous results. I listen to audio tapes while in the bath, and this one was so awful that I had to get out of the tub and drip water all over the bathroom floor in order to turn it off so that I could have a relaxing bath. Please, read the book, but steer clear of the audio production!"
5,i loved this book!!!!,"i would recommend this book to anyone! it makes me want to develop my own ""saving graces"" group. it was inspiring and just a wonderful, well written story. i listened to it on cd which was so fun b/c the reader, beth fowler, used a different voice for each character. patricia gaffney is a wonderful writer!"
2,A so-so beach read,"I know everyone else loved this book. I didn't and Im not sure exactly why.. It just didn't reach me. I felt a little like I was reading a 'wanna be' of the Ya Ya Sisterhood, which I loved. I didn't think the characters rang true. But like I say, must be just me."
5,Friendship,Totally absorbing view of very different women bound by friendship. Their love and loyalty is inspiring.
3,Bring your tissues along!,"I listen to this book on tape. The characters were read by different voices and really gave and extra dose of life to the story. The brief saga Gaffney shared of the four lives of the ""Saving Graces"" was like a soap opera. I would hurry back to my car to hear what was going to happen next to either Rudy, Emma, Isabell or Lee. I began to feel like they were family members and cried like a baby when Isabell lost her battle with cancer. This book covered the full range of emotions in 4 audio tapes. I laughed, I cried, I cursed the men that scorned them. I highly recommend this book, but remember to keep your tissues close by for the tears of laughter and tears of sadness."
1,Women talk...too much about not much,"I percieved this to be more women talk about trite, everyday problems that go on an on, and on and on. Nothing new, nothing enlightening. Same old middle adult whining, crying, neediness, divorce, infertility, struggling mental health, searching for approval; it was another shallow soap opera type despite the emotions that were described. My mother would have loved it. This, after Ya Ya Sisterhood and The Red Tent, I've read enough about the delightful gossip, oops, meaningful observations of female [support] groups. Yes, my book discussion group will like it, but I remain among the bored minority and in need of finding something more adventurous in fiction, or with more substance in non-fiction."
5,Madame Butterfly Goes to Washington,"Perceptive to how the myriad of feelings we humans possess becomes tightly wound from the girdles of our souls to the crests of our hearts like the reverberant and brooding strings of a vintage cello, Patricia Gaffney has composed a masterful orchestration in this her magnificent opus THE SAVING GRACES -- a billowing drama of operatic proportions arousing the improbable images of Maria Callas, Kiri te Kanawa, Joan Sutherland, and Sarah Brightman as castaways on the Isle of Suburbia singing lamentations on a theme of fleeting camaraderie."
4,A Heart-Warming REAL book about women.,I loved it! The characters reminded you of someone you know or yourself and you can't help but relating yourself to them. The way the story jumped from each women's perspective was refreshing and it was done in a way that wasnt confusing and kept you reading on for more. I laughed out loud and shed a tear -I can't wait for more books from her. I wanted to start writing a book of my own afterward because it was a simple story with a lot of emotion and very real!
5,Didn't want it to end!,I picked up this book and I didn't know a thing about it. I was a very lucky person! this is a quick and delightful book. I found myself totally wrapped up in the plot from the 1st page until the last word!
3,Just ok,"This blanket is very soft, and when I first got it I thought it was great. After a couple of washings, it has a hole in it at the edge of the applique and I'm going to have to repair it before I can use it with the baby again. Definitely should be washed on gentle cycle."
2,Higher Ground - Voices of Contemporary Gospel Singers,This DVD was not what I thought it would be. I thought it was a musical DVD!
4,Very Good,I enjoy the CD. I like it a little more each time I listen to it. I especially like the more upbeat songs like Kiss of Heaven and New Eyes. I would recomend!
4,MUCH BETTER THAN I EXPECTED,i wasn't sure what to expect from this cd but i must say that i was plesantly surprised. the whole cd is good but the one track that stands out is martina mcbride's song called you'll get through this. she is one phenomenal singer and this song is truly inspirational. her vocal performance alone makes this cd worth having.
2,rare Michelle Tumes,"I love you, Michelle Tumes. Love your voice, and most of your songs. The one on this album (Sanctuary) is probably your worst, and that's probably why you didn't ever want it to appear on a Michelle Tumes album. Everyone has a bad day, I suppose."
1,Mercy Sucks,This cd is junk and so is mercy. Open your eyes. The scandal is all over the internet. I bought the cd years ago and then went to mercy. What they sing and preach about is false.
4,Great Product!,Great product! The glue that secures the holding cup came undone. Very minor issue. Gravity maintains the integrity of the product's ability to secure the cup to the helmet.
4,HOT! at the start but ......Where'd it go?,"After six years of lusting after FBI agent Cameron Wolfe, Lawyer Sandra Bradley jumps at the chance to go to bed with him when he invites himself along on her sabbatical vacation! But when danger threatens, the Lone Wolfe's high-handed macho instincts really grate on Sandra's fiercely independent yet sensitive nature."
2,More is less,"Reading her previous book, called ""N.P."" was a real trip. It took you into different sensory dimension, where language exists only as one of many ways of communication between people. This was a place, where magic was woven into fabric of everyday life. Her new novel""Amrita"" desintegrates in too many words and not enough insights. After a while your gaze skips paragraphs, moves around and you end up turning on your TV..."
2,Disappointing after books like Kitchen and NP,"This book just falls apart. It doesn't have the dense atmosphere which made Kitchen so great.Some interesting passages, but all in all very disappointing."
3,Ho-Hum,I tried my best to lose myself in this book but I just couldn't. It didn't captivate me as much as the other book by this author did. Perhaps it was a result of the long and stressful work week that hindered my reading of this book. I don't know. I think sometime in the future I'll have to give this book a second go.
4,an interesting book,"I usually read historical fiction or fantasy, so rating this book as compared to other books of its type is difficult, but I liked it. It made me think. Sometimes I would have to stop reading it and just think about something in it. It never made me dying to keep reading because it was just SO interesting, but it never really got boring either."
4,Finally A Female Brautigan From Japan!,"The title of this book turned me on to the fiction of Banana Yoshimoto. Somehow I missed Bananamania. What a great discovery to make, no matter how late. Banana Yoshimoto reminds me of Richard Brautigan. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it is the deceptively simple prose. More likely it is the powerful sense of the implied author. By the time you finish the book, you feel as though you can call her Banana, that you would like to call Banana and make a date for tea or something. I read the book on Christmas morning while I was stranded far from home and being in Banana's Japan was oddly comforting. Sorry if this review doesn't give you much of a clue what the book is about. The style and tone and sense of the implied author are far more important. I'd like to go to Japan, now, and call up Banana Yoshimoto, get together and talk about Richard Brautigan when he was in Japan."
2,Disappointing,"Usually, I regard the lonely planet series as one of the best traveling guides. This book fails to stand the same standard that other books from this series established. Nature has a very brief description, and the cities part does not give a very clear picture of what is worthy and what doesn't. I found the Moon series book on texas much better."
3,Yankee,"This book forgot to mention the bars on the coke machines at every rest stop in Texas and the filth and general depressed nature of lots of those small towns like Waco and Hillsboro. Oh and the ""go home"" attitude of the Texans if you happen to have a license plate from a Northern State. Safety should be an issue while visiting. Some areas white folks are the minority, too but I don't see that mentioned in these wonderful travel books. I would love to see a real story of some of these states. Been there and was not impressed."
3,Where is the beauty of New Hampshire,"I was hoping to take an armchair scenic tour around New Hampshire by watching this DVD, but I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of attention to New Hampshire's beautiful seasonal changes. The chapter on fall foliage was too short, and there was no coverage of colorful summer wildflowers or snowy winter villages. The Editorial Review describes the content accurately. I just expected to see more of New Hampshire's landscape. If you enjoy watching men makes boots or seeing bears do silly tricks, then spend $25 on this DVD. If you are looking for spectacular scenery, save your money."
3,"Historically accurate, psychoanalytic slant","The author draws heavily from firsthand accounts of the period with some attempts to weed out the falsehoods. The story he tells flows fairly well and the naration is smooth. The book made for a good read.My only detraction was that the author attempted, wherever possible, to explain the actions or motivations of Joan of Arc through the use of psychoanalitic techniques, with heavy emphasis on Freudianism."
5,Fishbone is Red Hot,"Great show by one of the greatest live acts still touring after almost 30 years. It's a shame they don't get as much recognition as the deserve. Nuthin but props and respect for bands like No Doubt, Sublime, etc... but they simply would not exist or would at least not be the same with out Fishbone.Fishbone Soldier since 1987!"
5,Seller is good and honest about his product,"I wanted this book after reading a short story from msn. I went to Barnes and Borders, but they didn't have it. I found this seller, and was selling it very dear. I figured it was going to be in bad shape. But once I received it, it was brand NEW! I love reading this book, though my hearbreaks each time I imagine the agony and the torture the blacks have gone through. Thank you so much for your honesty."
2,I couldn't even finish it,"I was excited when I finally got the chance to read about Harriet Tubman, but when I started reading this book, my excitement went downhill. I don't know if the book just didn't capture my attention or if Harriet Tubman's life wasn't what I thought. Anyway I barely got through the book so can't say much about it except that I lost interest."
2,Where is Harriet?,"Sorry to disappoint, but this book is not really about Harriet Tubman. I would liken it to a college student majoring in the histrory of slavery, with a minor in Harriet Tubman. I wanted to know more about this very great lady. I was disappointed."
5,One of the best non-fiction books I have read,I was a young unit clerk in a cardiac care unit back in 1980 when this book came out. The physician who was the head of our department brought 20 copies into us and asked us all to read this wonderful book. It touched all of us and I know that it helped all of us improve the manner in which we cared for our patients and their families. As I grew older and began to loose loved ones the wisdom in this book has helped me ease my way through. I would recommend this book to anyone!
3,reality check,"a lil boring. mainly lil cease talking about the legal spectacle that lil kim put on that ended up getting her a year and a day for prejury all because she still holds feelings of ill will towards the junior mafia for taking care of them after big's death. raises some valid and intriguing questions, like what makes a snitch."
3,worth watching but who really cares,when big died junior mafia died with him it took those fools 10 years to release their second cd who realy bought lil cease's wack azz solo joint and we all know lil kim slept around to further her career so what she went to jail she was right at home with all the other lesbo's.
2,Not Very Good,"I had a lot of hope for this movie after seeing it compared to ""Man Bites Dog"". For anyone who has seen this comparison to a genuinely great film, it is WAY off. This comes off more like a film school project from people with a couple of friends who were interns at a special effects company.The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because there were a few genuinely disturbing moments that will be hard to forget.If you're into the ""August Undergroud"" movement (poor/no direction, amateur actors, nasty-looking female actresses getting snuffed), maybe this will be up your alley. If you're looking for a quality film, look elsewhere."
3,The Spinal Tap of Cannibal Films,"Forget Ravenous, forget the Donner Party, Forget ALIVE, this is the most realistic movie about cannibals that i've ever seen. Even though it's done much like Spinal Tap, this movie is atleast thought provoking.This show's what it's like to be a real cannibal from start to finish...the ending doesn't really make much sense, but the begining and inbetween are pretty cool. The special effects are great, the characters are well portrayed and acted. This movie is slightly below films like ""Behind The Mask"" as far as enjoyment and doing the documentary style movie, but it's still pretty cool. Check it out if you like horror films or cannibals."
2,Creepy and boderline disturbing.,"There were actually a couple of places in the movie that me cringe. In the kind of ewwwwwwww....gross kind of way.Overall, not a bad movie. Not a great one either. You can see the ending coming a mile away.It's worth a watch if you want to ""get in the head of a serial killer/cannibal"". Kind of.Overall, I was meh about the whole movie."
2,Minnesota Vikings Official Replica Mini Helment,My grandson was very please with this Xmas gift last year. It is currently displayed in his room this was a gift to be proud of for a football lover and fan.
5,Great workout,"I have 5 Billy Blanks' Tae Bo workout DVD's. This particular one is a great workout and is by far the most fun. The people working out (including Billy) are upbeat and animated, which keeps you motivated and energetic. This workout is not his toughest, but it sitll makes you burn and sweat!"
5,I love it!,"This is my favorite Billy Blanks workout. My roommate and I purchased it because we wanted to try something different. The moves were a little challenging the first time through, but we caught on quickly. It is one of our favorite videos now. You can tell everyone in the DVD is having fun and we have a great time doing it too. This DVD is good for everyone, but beginners should expect a challenge."
2,Worst Taebo workout I own..,"I bought this one based upon the reviews here on Amazon. I have to say that I was really disappointed. It is more of a dance video and my heartrate didn't seem to get that high during the workout (I use a monitor).I would recommend the Cardio Celebrity workout if you are looking for something newer, but I still think the Advanced workout is the hardest."
3,"Win some, lose some","Billy Blanks seems to loosen up on his tough edge, although he does add in some fun (via silly dance moves). He doesn't make you perform the usual gazillion sets of moves, but quickly advances you from one exercise to the next. You'll still sweat, but you can't expect to be drenched. Get this DVD if you want to have a little workout fun."
4,****Not for beginners!!!!,"I'm beginner and of course I couldn't pick up with this video, though I tried hard and I did my best, and I got a good work out. But I'll keep this one aside for now until get more comfortable. But anyway I loved it! Great moves not boring at all, they people do seem to be having way too much fun. Like I said not for a beginner, but if you're in an advanced level go for it, you will love it! Think sweat all the way.10/16/06"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD IF YOU REALLY LIKE MUSIC ! ! ! ! !,"First of all, shame on Amazon for not providing sufficient information on this CD, but one would think that since it lists the artists who originally performed this song, that it would actually be the tune you were accustomed to hearing on the radio. WRONG!!!! Even though the back of the CD state ""Original Artists"" AND ""Original Recordings"", what you will get if you buy this is some rendition that I am sure you have never heard before; ON EVERY SINGLE TRACK!!! Some sound like they brought in the original artist in last year, played some MIDI or Karaoke background music and let the artist wail away. ""Billy, Don't be a Hero"" on this CD will almost make you laugh! I don't know how to get a refund, but I sure as heck am going to try!!! I have emailed the record company to see what they have to say, but I am not optimistic. Hopefully I have saved you from spending some money for a worthless disk. Too bad too, some of these songs are classics."
2,Joseph Brown's opinion:,This is a good book that gives the general idea of how to paint a mural but technique is only lightly touched upon.
3,something better,Although this book was visually nice to look at I found it lacked in teaching me how to paint murals. I have stumbled across a great site that has free tutorials on it. I hope you find this helpful. The site is [...]
2,Deceptive Description,"This item is advertised as having a 5-Cup Blue Chill GLASS Freezer Jar. It is PLASTIC. Since we were specifically looking for a blender with a glass jar, this does not suit our needs."
4,who needs a blue chill???,"After many years of using relatively low-priced blenders that disappointed me in one way or another, I have been very pleased so far with the Oster 6819 14-speed Blender. Perhaps its best aspect is the mechanism for attaching the jar to the motor that prevents the spill-over I have so often experienced with other blenders. My only misgiving about it is the blue chill liquid that has been introduced between two layers of plastic in the jar. I haven't made a frozen daiquiri for years and would probably find this aspect very desirable if I still did this. But for now I think I would have preferred this blender with a plain glass jar."
3,Good but not great,"This book started out at a slow pace, which is what I wanted. But it didn't take long before it took off at a fast pace. Math has never been easy for me, and I find myself working very hard to digest the instructions. On a few occasions, I could never get the answer to match the one in the book. Perhaps I just didn't get the premise, but I followed the instructions to the best of my ability, checked and rechecked the work and decided that the answers were incorrect. Perhaps I was out of my depth. To bad, I really hoped that this would bring me up to speed."
1,Introductory Algebra for College Students,We ordered the Third Edition and received the Second Edition. I would like to return this book for the Third Edition of Introductory Algebra for College Students.
3,"Intereresting...sure, but needs further research","An interesting read and challenge to the views held by orthodox ancient history scholars. The author has identified several dubious claims made by early egyptologists which made their way uncontested into the backbone of the traditionally accepted bronze and iron age chronologies of the Middle East, Anatolia & Egypt. The alternative reconstruction offered by the author, while not thoroughly convincing, should at least inspire scholars to carry on further research and seriously explore the implications of this work.The book tells a good solid story, but it needs an index and more substance."
3,Lunar eclipse,"I hadn't realized when I purchased this that it was all instrumental except for one song. It is quite wonderful, to listen to this man play the piano straight."
3,still working on it,"ordered and received on time. I purchased this stuff because I thought I could concoct some home made ginger ale. This stuff is very, very strong. I'm still working on the mix"
5,"An enthusiastically written collection, brimming with energy and the vivacious need for expression","Arguments for Stillness is an anthology of free-verse poems that range in composition from vulgar curse words to pop culture, slices of everyday life, ancient history, and nods to allegorical references from classic literature and drama. An enthusiastically written collection, brimming with energy and the vivacious need for expression. ""Smoking Is Not an Activity"": He is a banished man for a time / Because he his wife hates cigarettes. // He tries to understand this as he sits / In the hallway's smoky exile feeling / Like Trotsky without an agenda."
4,Great gift,I bought this for a friends baby 1st birthday. She can already put the shapes on. Not in the right places but still trys. Age on item says 1 1/2+
4,"Easy to use, and cheap considering the space.","2 gigs for 60 bucks is a great deal, had to jump on it. No DRM foolishness, the interface is straightforward, file transfer is easy, the sound is great. Only complaint I would have is it's smaller than it looks in the pictures, but I got used to it quick."
3,Not that great...,"I've been looking for an mp3 player other than an ipod for a really long time, and finally hopped upon this little one. Reading the reviews on Amazon, I truly expected more than I got.The player itself seems ok. Music quality is good, but only if you get your own better headphones. Screen is perfectly functional, if a tad small. But there were some qualities that I did not particularly enjoy.For example, to me the button felt really cheap. It moved around a lot, and I had to press it extra hard for it to do anything. Next, the menu itself is definitely nothing worth looking at. It was simply the same as you would have on your computer, with the same folders. The only difference was that on this one you needed to wait a minute for all your music to load up before you could press any buttons. Otherwise, you would just be back where you started.Personally, I sent this one back, and am thinking of trying out a Zen."
3,An Attack On Selfishness,"The book is really rather interesting, although there is still the feeling that they are fighting an uphill battle, and attitudes such as the previous reviewer's rather narrow political rant are exactly the reason for that.Why someone should have an inherent right to own a peice of history is beyond me.The fact that John Long is an Australian has little effect on it; neither Australia nor America fail to recognise property rights, and neither Australia nor America allow the insanely unrestrained greed-based capitalism (as opposed to rights-based) that some Americans seem to promote.Perhaps what we need, in addition to this book, is a philosophical tome outlining the reason why a right to an education, and a right to access the fruits of scientific endeavours, sometimes override the rather obscure ""right to take anything thats in the ground and abritrarily claim to have a property right to it"". I wonder why they left that out of the UN DHR?"
2,Disappointing and factually frustrating.,"McCartney comes across like a baby whining about how they didn't get as much credit and attention as they deserve for their achievements. He is an acknowledged musical genius loved by millions and worth as much. What more does he want? Barry Miles was horrendous with his factual errors and in the world of Beatle fans, who know EVERYTHING about their beloved group, this is the ultimate sin. I was looking forward to understanding how Lennon/McCartney truly created their music. Instead I got Paul winking at me, reminding all that he was basically responsible for every innovation the Beatles came up with. Overall this is not a book worth having."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!!! BUY IT NOW!!!,"This book gave me the sense of traveling through Sir McCartney's life from the time he was a young teenager up to his Knighting in 1997. He seemed to give an honest assessment of all the things whirling around him during his legendary life and did not sugar coat the bad stuff. As a McCartney/Beatle fan, I throughly enjoyed this book. It was almost sad when I had read the last page........"
1,McCartney Exposed,"This year Santa left me the John Lennon Anthology box and this book. Many Years From Now I'm sure I'll still be playing the CD's but hopefully I'll have forgotten all about the time I wasted on this smug, humorless and self satisfied piece of drivel. Dame Paul obviously chose Miles to ""ghost"" the book because he knew that he'd not be challenged on any of his rather ridiculous claims and Miles does nothing to analyze any of Paul's statements.Does anybody know if Geroge Martin has commented on or reviwed this bbok? I'd love to know what he has to say.Now, having revealed that he invented MTV, avant-garde music and every other major art form of the 20th century, what is left to be revealed in the inevitable 2nd volume?"
5,What a great book!,"I am currently undertaking the task of writting an honors thesis on the life and music of Paul McCartney... and this book has given me a great place to start. It is filled with interviews with Paul himself, John Lennon, George Martin, and all sorts of other neat people. It is written by an old friend of McCartney- so it is really amazingly detailed. It is filled with neat little facts... for example, did you know that the origional words to ""Yesterday"" were ""Scrambled Eggs""? It sounds ridiculous... but if you sing it, it sounds just right. Anyway, this is a great book! I really recommend it for anyone who is interested in the life of Sir McCartney or The Beatles."
4,Interesting to ex-Weybridge residents like me!!,"The book is clearly comprehensive in its handling of the life and work of Paul McCartney. Of specific interest to me are the details of how the song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" was inspired by Julian Lennon's drawing of Lucy O'Donnell (a story of which I was hitherto aware only in outline). You see, I, Michael Taylor (or Michael Taylor 2 as I was known in class there) am an ex-pupil of the said Heath House School, Weybridge, which I attended from 1965-1967!! (I still have my termly reports intact by the way.) I was born in 1960 and lived in Weybridge for a bit, but by the time I was at Heath House we had moved to nearby Walton-on-Thames. I am currently alive and, I suppose, well, and in deepest Lincolnshire, England. I shall proceed to re-look at the remainder of the book with the level of attention it clearly deserves, as soon as I am able."
4,"The Lennonista will hate it, but it's fair to John","There is a certain segment of John Lennon fans who choose to deify Lennon and find any reason to despise Paul McCartney. They seem to forget that Paul has lived under many years of John having lied outright about Paul's contributions, and the Lennon brigade have repeated those lies. If Paul is defensive and insecure (and he is), he at least sees John through the eyes of love in this book, which is something John didn't always do in return.It's flawed and stilted, but the subject has rarely been treated fairly in other books, so one can understand if he's a bit self-protective."
2,Disappointing,"This ""biography"" makes one long for a true, objective biography such as the recently-released ""Lennon"" by Philip Norman.While there are some fun little stories sprinkled throughout the Chapters, so much of this comes across as bitter, revisionist and petty. McCartney seems obsessed with claiming songwriter percentages - nearly every song discussion includes the likes of ""oh, this was 70% me and maybe 30% John."" EVERY freaking song!Who cares?McCartney has often been portrayed as bossy, self-serving and, yes, petty. That this is the ""authorized"" biography sadly confirms those claims.This book isn't a complete waste of time - but almost."
4,interesting,"I liked this book. It showed Paul as being a regular kid growing up. When he got popular he became a playboy, but he still tried to lay low, so to speak. I have always been a true Paul fan, so this was a good read for me. I liked how the creation of some beatles songs came about. He wrote songs for other artists that I was not aware of."
4,The Best McCartney Book Out There,"So far, this is one of my favorite Beatle related books. Using what must have been amazing interviews with Paul over the years, the author lets him do the talking. Paul has quite a memory (thank God) and he doesn't hold back. His casual attitude towards 'pulling birds' may hurt some feelings, as it did mine, but once Linda appears all is forgiven. A nice balance of personal and professional activities, and quite an insight into Paul's interest in art which one never hears much about. A must for any true Macca fan."
4,The Beat goes on...,"It is hard to believe that Paul McCartney is in his seventies, this musician has changed the course of history and is a living legend.In Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now by Barry Miles, the author had time to sit down with McCartney and get his perspective of a remarkable life.The title come from a conversation where McCartney admits that speaking of the Beatles is like speaking of something unrealistic, like it happen in the future. He notes, ""I feel like the sixties is about to happen. It feels like a period in the future to me, rather than a period in the past.""What I found fascinating of this book is that captures the many phases and changes of McCartney's career. You get the real scoop of the relationship of all the band members and how much of a hard and focused worker McCartney is.McCartney also opens up into the personal life and overall this book is the perfect one to gain insight.The beat goes on and so does the music of Paul McCartney."
1,WARNING--MISLEADING TITLE,"I post this simply as a warning to buyers, after being misled myself: the title and the names of the plays (prominently displayed on the cover) would lead you believe, as I did, that this is a collection of those plays, like The Best American Short Stories or something of that sort. Far from it. This is a theater yearbook, and the plays are represented by essays about them--certainly not what I thought I was getting. This packaging is clearly [misleading].I give it one star rather than none because it represents a good deal of honest work, and it probably has some merit on its own terms..."
3,Air conditioner and heater in one,While I have had excellent experiences with the air conditioning (alone) unit of this company..and this works well as far as the heating element..The air conditioning element is not quite as strong
5,Supercharged!,"Dr. Freddy Davis' book Supercharged is an unusual book in that it is very difficult to put down once you begin reading, but requires--rather DEMANDS--an extended application-type reading also. The principles of this book are applicable to everyone, yet are as personal as the individual reader. Dr. Davis states that what a person did in the past, does now, and continues to do throughout life is what that individual chooses to do. As I read this book, I discovered many areas of my life which I have now chosen to change. By following Dr. Davis' instructions to ""live on the edge, hold nothing back, have no fear, and have no regrets"" I have begun my new ""Supercharged"" lifestyle! This is a dynamic, exciting, powerful MUST READ book!"
3,"Ok, OK the book is just ok","I did not go nuts for this book. I have find alot of better books but this book is still ok. It will show you how to interact with cgi programs, use java for client-server application and some more. I would not run out to buy it, but I would buy it"
2,Great acting wasted on utterly BORING movie,"I bought this film based on the directing of Mike Leigh and the lead actor Jim Broadbent, who had so successfully linked up in Topsy Turvy - a remarkable insight into the lives and music of Gilbert and Sullivan. While I found Broadbent and the other actors in this movie to be convincing, I found the story itself and the sad sack loser characters it portrays to be painful to endure. Basically nothing happens in the movie - ends as boringly as it starts.This is a character study of lost souls propped up by draining the energy and time of the ""normal"" main characters they rely upon. The ""normal"" main characters are portrayed so convincingly you want to wince when they have to survive the burdens imposed by their well meaning friends and family. If you are into slow-moving and intricate character pieces about the burdens of ordinary life, you may enjoy this. Frankly, it seemed like a well acted but depressing soap opera piece to me."
2,Depressingly Bleak,I never understood why certain films with foreign actors get the acclaim they do. A sad movie (and not the kind that makes you cry but the kind that makes you want to hang yourself). There doesn't seem to be a plot or anything that drives it. It's basically about a couple surrounded by depressing and superficial individuals...so sad.
3,Depressing,"We found the acting to be superior. Keeping track of the characters throughout the movie was confusing. Overall we didn't find a clear plot, and there was no conclusion."
4,Mickey Spillane IS Mike Hammer,"Having watched a number of Mike Hammer t.v. shows, I was looking forward to seeing what the author (Mickey Spillane) could bring to his creation. I was not disappointed. I was, in fact, suprised by how well he played Mike Hammer, and I would definitely recommend this film to fans of all ages. The only thing that bothered me about the film is the often annoying soundtrack. Note: the movie is in widescreen format"
4,shower bar handle,very helpful after my husband had his surgery this pass year. made him feel very secure and comfortable getting in and out of the shower.
1,Not secure,I tried using it a number of times. Both of the items repeatedly fell off shower wall after 20 minutes.
5,5 Star Fixture!,Made well and securely holds on smooth shower surface. Big enough to easily grab if needed. I would recommend it!
3,"Good idea, doesn't work for me","It turned out that all our tile has a slightly bumpy pattern, and the suction won't stick. I can't use it anywhere."
1,"How do you spell ""Worthless""?",This is one of those suction cup grab bars. They are only as strong as the suction they can create -- which is very darn little. A tiny child could pull one off the wall My husband bought a set; sometimes they fell off the wall before anyone ever tried to use one.
2,caretaker,"Suction cups do not adhere to tile that is not totally smooth. If the surface has any deviation at all from smooth, the grip does not sustain the hold. Too dangerous."
1,Shower bar does not work,"We bought the shower bar. We have 4-inch tiles in our bathroom, like most houses in the US. The instructions that come with the bar discuss use of the bar on 4-inch tiles, but the bar is designed in such a way that it will not work on 4-inch tiles. It will work on some other surfaces, but will not work on the most popular tile size.The manufacturer ignored our email plea for help or advice.If you have 4-inch bathroom tiles, do not buy this device and expect it to work."
2,Doesnt give a safe hold.,"Be careful buying these for people who actually need them. The first time it was used, it seemed to work fine but after that, the seal broke within minutes and I wouldnt trust it for an elderly person needing support. I read reviews from people who said they needed to replace the hold each time it was intended to be used, and I was okay with that. But after placing it, it was only less than a minute before the seal started giving way. I guess if you get it to stick and test it before each shower, you might be okay but for me, I found it was much safer just to buy a shower bench and let them sit on that before I help them out."
4,New Grab Bar,"I needed a grab bar for my shower prior to spinal surgery. This product holds securely to the shower wall, and while you are not supposed to put your whole weight on it, I am no longer nervous holding on to it to help support me when I lower myself on to my shower stool. I'm glad I purchased it."
5,"16"" grab bar","I like the grab bar I received for Christmas 2010. I do test it before using it, as suggested, and it is a help in getting out of my tub after a shower. I have since bought a smaller grab bar for travels."
5,safe,I didn't have anything before and I was afraid I would slip or fall in the tub while taking a shower. It's a scary feeling knowing that your don't have anything to grab onto while your in the shower if you start to fall or slip. Now I don't have those feeings and I feel safe.
1,Blowhard from Killdevilhill,"Having read this book with an eye towards perhaps learning some profound Princetonian insights, all that actually occurs is rampent agita and the strange void that pervades the mind when all too familiar claptrap riles (sic) the day. I have tried to enjoy this pap but it is purely filler paper and signifies less than nothing...must have been a 'vanity press' affair since I have grave doubts that a publisher of rank would dish out front money for this tripe. Ivy League indulgence with a small ""i"" and precious little else...also the sonnets are terrible too...if this is the Rennaisance then let Armageddon begin..."
1,"Absolutely, astonishingly bad","A true sign of a work's worthlessness is the amount of venom and bizarre conspiratorial ravings that its followers heap on anyone who criticizes it. See the Ayn Rand writings, the torture that is L. Ron Hubbard, and now this offering of garbage.This book posits itself as rescuing literature from ""postmodernism"", but it is the sort of rescuer who kills the hostage in the attempt. For what is ""Drake Raft"" -- with its ceaseless, horrific non-jokes, its inept syntax, its groaningly obvious allegories, its artless, pathetic prose style, its witless ""plot"" -- if not a brutal, ugly murder of literature? McGucken is a verbicide and his book is terrible."
1,"Frighteningly Small, Unforgivably Ignorant, Rather Repulsive","This is worth reading, as it seems set to become a cult classic (as a result of self-generated hype of the sort it pretends to despise), but it's a puny thing.Really, despite a glimmer of lightheartedness here and there, it's poorly written (to put it mildly), poorly edited, and above all narrow. Narrow in ideas, narrow in learning and narrow in any sense of history, which is odd, as it claims to be reclaiming history. Another odd thing is that while the author sets out to defend 'the western canon', there's little evidence that he's actually read that many books, much less looked at many paintings, etc, etc."
1,Apallingly Bad,"Bilge, pure bilge. Please don't buy this, anyone who may have found this entry by accident."
2,Disappointing,"This is sub-par McGucken. Sirs, I've read better McGucken, and this is a disappointment for the public. But I have faith in a better sequel."
