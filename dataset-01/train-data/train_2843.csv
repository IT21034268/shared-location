2,its not that great.,"have it at max 35 lbs, on my Toyota Sienna, the van still sags with a full vehicle. too scared to put more air in tha bags, as it's stated max pressure is like 30 lbs.When empty, it does ride stiffer in the back. so I guess it does a little bit."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Delivery was fast. Inserting the air springs between the coils was much easier than I anticipated. Once installed, product seems to work as advertised.Cons: Routing air lines was more difficult than anticipated. Would likely be easy on truck with I-beam frame members. My Toyota Sienna has nothing but smooth surfaces underneath, so difficult to find a place to route airlines. Also, had issues sliding air lines over nipples on air shocks without damaging airlines and causing them to leak (hint, use soapy water).Good product once installed."
1,Air lift for towing,It doesn't fit witout some modification to our vehicle. I should return it. The website where we purchased the Air Lift 1000 did not disclose the neeed modify our vehicle as I recall.
1,Don't buy !,Bought and installed according to directions. while installing I noticed that the top of the airbags were secured with a plastic nut on plastic threads. I didn't care much for the quality and couldn't see how the cheap flimsy parts could hold up. They didn't! The top of one airbag sheared off at the base after just a few weeks of use. when I called regarding a warranty replacement I was told that the airbag was not covered by the warranty. Apparently only the metal bracket is covered by the warranty. What a ridiculous sense of customer service this company has.....Never again
5,Great product,Installed on my 2005 AWD Sienna with KYB shocks. Transformed ride and handling both loaded and unloaded. I installed myself with hand tools.
2,Disappointed,"I have a Toyota Sienna. I needed something to help support a 300 lb tongue weight on my minivan. In July of 2010, I only traveled 70 miles at 35 psi, and the passenger side bag developed a leak at the seam. What a disappointment. Do NOT waste your money. (These were installed in November of 2009 and kept at 5 psi with no issues)[Update: Company replaced the air bag for no cost, but I paid for shipping]"
5,Great Product,"Air Lift bags has turned my 2007 Toyota Sienna into a 'super hauler'. Four square of shingles - no problem, 300 lb. trampoline (in a box) - no problem. This is the second vehicle I've installed this product. The ride without a load seems the same. The ride with a load is good and the rear isn't dragging anymore. Installation is easy. The only semi-difficult part is routing the air hoses."
2,"""nonstick""??","I bought this product to cook flour tortillas and it works fine for that purpose. But, I would not advise buying it to cook pancakes. They stick like super glue, even when I use oil on the pan."
3,Complete Bible Suite,Can't give musch of a review; I've not had time to work with it. I've been away from home.
5,GREAT GRILL!!!,"I have had this grill for 2 years now and I LOVE IT!! It is a workhorse!! I use my grill EVERY weekend and it's still going strong! Mine is exactly like this one except it has the side burner which I would highly recommend. It comes in handy for grillin' onions or heating up the beans for the BBQ. It also comes in handy when I want to cook bacon on weekends and not have the mess in the kitchen.Again, a GREAT grill for the price.The Cajun Cooker"
3,This product takes some getting used to. My ...,"This product takes some getting used to. My heels were sore, but they're getting more accustomed to the insoles now. My dress socks bunch up around them a bit. I think if my shoes weren't already broken in they might fit a bit better. I'd recommend putting them in a new pair of shoes and giving them a few weeks."
3,"The idea was good, but they really weren't ...","The idea was good, but they really weren't too comfortable. If they covered the whole shoe rather than just half the shoe, they would've been very comfortable. I wouldn't purchase another pair and I wouldn't recommend them."
5,My husband does a lot of woodworking in ...,"My husband does a lot of woodworking in our garage. The floor is concrete and his back always hurts after standing for any length of time. The insoles really made a difference. He was able to stand for a lot longer without his back hurting. He said the insoles were really comfortable. He's tried regular boot inserts, but the shape of these was a lot better. He said he would buy another pair when these wear out. He would recommend them to friends and family."
2,My biggest problem with this product was comfort. ...,"My biggest problem with this product was comfort. The insoles would shift around even though I had """"installed"""" them properly. Rather than contribute to comforting and supporting my feet, they did just the opposite. They didn't fit well (maybe it was just my feet!) and wouldn't stay put. I took time to break them in and did all that. I wanted to make them work, but they just weren't successful for me."
2,"Disappointingly, using this product produced no effect at ...","Disappointingly, using this product produced no effect at all! There was no noticeable improvement in my lower back or knee pain whatsoever. While there was no worsening of the problem areas, I cannot recommend purchasing the product. It literally did nothing and so would not be a very wise investment. I was truly hoping for a product that would help to alleviate some of my back and knee discomfort."
3,Not what I needed,"This book is okay for beginner, so it was a little to basic for what I was looking for. If you've never been introduced to drawing Manga before, then this book is good for you. It vaguely goes over different nose styles (personally it could've done the same with eyes) and it could have gone over action and poses more, but again, I'd recommend this book for a beginner."
3,Definately felt like a complete idiot.,I purchased both editions of this book so i was really disappointed when i realized that it was the exact same book as the second edition. The only thing really different is the cover. As for the book itself. It has a lot of the basics covered but i wouldn't recommend this book to a beginner because it only briefly goes over broad sketching and does not break down the drawings.
4,Pretty good. =],"This book includes a LOT of information, which I really like. However, for the ""drawing manga"" part, not so much. Though suitable for beginners, more advanced drawers should definately get a book more focused on drawing.This book shows the basics for drawing a human figure, and some basic poses. It's good for people who have a hard time drawing proportionally. Though I certainly didn't gain much drawing experience from this book, all the information and many drawings are great to read through. Overall, I feel that it should be titled ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Manga"" instead."
5,Grandson says yes!,"I gave this guide to my grandson, age 12, for a summer project. He said to give it 5 stars. He has produced some exceptional pictures. Even took it with him for a one week camping trip. Kudos to John Layman."
5,Papa Married a Mormon,"This is my all time favorite book and I highly recommend to anyone interested in American history. A story about the old ""wild west"" and the people who made America the strong nation that it is today. A Catholic man falls in love with a Mormon woman and the what happens as they raise their family in Utah in the late 1860s, which had gunfights, saloon kings, and also faithful reverends, charitable women, and people whose lives changed for the better. Once you start, you won't be able to put it down. Author also wrote ""Uncle Will's Saloon,"" a story which comes before this book, and aforementioned, ""Mama's Boarding House."" Both are not as good as this one, but still fun to read. Too bad they are out of print."
4,A Great Ambience Enhancer,"Since there is no fireplace in my home, I thought I'd purchase one on Blu-ray. I'm glad I did. Amazon had a great price for this Blu-ray / DVD Combo pack just in time for the holidays. I played the Christmas-themed fireplace throughout December while wrapping gifts and reading to create a cozy atmosphere. Here's a breakdown of the Pros and Cons:Pros:Great picture quality from the Blu-ray on my 50"" plasmaThe amount of crackling logs was just right for the holiday themed fireplace's soundtrack4 different fireplace options: Traditional, Beach, Holiday and Castle - you can have a fireplace to go with the seasons and holidays.Different soundtrack options for each fireplace: Logs crackling + 3 ambient music optionsCombo-pack lets you keep the Blu-ray and give the DVD to a friend - a great valueCons (it's a very minor one):The holiday themed fireplace isn't a continuous view, at some point it changes to a closer shot of the fireplace. Not really a big deal, though."
1,A waste of time,Hawkins fails to convey the passion in these compositions. His playing is mechanical and soulless.
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this CD because several friends, whose taste I normally trust, had recommended it. I had very high hopes, but am disappointed. I have listened to the entire CD at least five times, and have found it to be one of the least appealing and most mannered collections of classical guitar pieces I have ever encountered. The Barrios interpretations sound overly-rehearsed, and no piece on the CD is played with honest emotion. Hawkins is certainly capable, but his playing lacks both the innovative spirit and technical virtuosity that the chosen pieces demand. Perhaps Hawkins would be better in live performance than he is on this collection, but I feel that buyers should be made aware of this CD's faults."
5,The Best of '98,"Unknown by most due to their place on an independent label, Starflyer 59 has released 4 full-length albums that have all shown new creativity than the one before. The Fashion Focus continues this trend by melting a large number of influences into something completely original. This album is quite possibly THE best of '98, and if not, it's the best that no one has heard of. It is a must for those who crave originality. The tracks are all great so it is impossible to single one out. Get this album now!"
4,"A bit more Jesus, please!","I`ve never been a big Starflyer 59 fan, but I really liked this one! Its catchy melodies and britrock sound, make The Fashion Focus one of the best albums of 1998. If the lyrics had dealt a bit more with faith and Jesus, this would have been the most ultimate christian album ever! But well done boys!"
5,Irresistable music from the first listen,"What an album. I was turned onto this album as a keyholder at Zia Records in Phoenix Arizona. My boss threw it in and pretty much everyone was hooked. It became a favorite of the entire staff. I tried to spin it about once a day. There were several times when we ran out of this album. Without fail, every time I played, a customer bought it. The melodies and hooks are wonderful. This was truly an inspired album. Of course ""Feel in love at 22"" is a standout, but the entire album is very well rounded. If it got some radio play, it would rocket up the charts. My favorite band on Tooth and Nail records."
5,"Jason Martin can sing, play, write...","I can't believe there's a reviewer who says Jason Martin can't sing. I can't imagine any other voice with these songs. Talk about gentle, beautiful, intense melodies-- there are few bands who put out such consistently amazing albums.Starflyer 59 is like the beat-up stuffed animal you've had forever... you can curl up with them and come back to yourself again. You can listen to them in your walkman, whatever the time of day or weather, and feel refreshed and doubly alive. You will claim them as a personal discovery in your music collection and there will be times you can't listen to anything else. SF59 is one of those bands I cringe to think I might have gone through life and never found. I pray that some day this band will get the recognition it has earned so many times over."
5,"good, powerful vacuum","I bought this to do cleanup while deleading my house. The vacuum is very powerful and easily picks up all the dust and small debris on the floor and other surfaces. It even picked up all the fine plaster dust when I had to cut the walls back for the new window trim. The floor attachment works well on wood floors. I passed the reoccupancy inspection on the first try, so it must actually be containing the lead dust. The seller was unclear about whether this was the HEPA filter version of the vacuum or not, but mine came with a HEPA filter installed (this vacuum can also have a cleanable canister filter that is not a HEPA filter).The paper bags that go in this vacuum cannot fill up all the way because the HEPA filter is in the middle of the vacuum and the bag does not have room to fill up. It still holds a large amount of dirt, allowing the HEPA filter to last longer. The bags are inexpensive and easy to replace."
4,record cd,"actually I bought this primarily to get just one song on the album, however there turned out to be several I like"
3,okay at best,With these type albums your relying on the taste of someone else.I think it would be better to buy the complete albums.
4,pretty good watch,face scratches a bit easily so be gentle. Band is substantial and holds up. Its a large face so men will like it and women who want the boyfriend large watch will like it too.
5,Good watch...not so hot strap,"Very good watch as Fossil most often delivers, in my opinion. The strap is rubber, don't be confused by the description! I bought four of these for gifts to sons and sons-in-law at Christmas. I was certainly proud to give them as gifts, but I fully intended them to have a leather strap as they were advertised then. The guys didn't know the difference except perhaps the one who is a ""watchie"" like his Dad! They just strapped them on right quickly and ""wore'em""!"
2,Can't See Time in Dark,"I liked the appearance of this watch, and purchased it. When I tried it on I was very happy with the look and feel. Then I realized it had no luminous hands or markings on it, and no light. For me personally, it was a deal-breaker. If that doesn't matter to you and you like the appearance, go for it as it is a nice watch."
2,How can anyone rate this higher than a 2 ?,The only reason I gave it two stars is firstly it looks cool hanging on the grill and secondly it is stainless. Other than that I was dissapointed at how flimsy the tools are and utterly useless. Once I got over the wow factor and used the set I began to question why I bought them. I have since found myself usin my existing kitchen tools and leaving the Weber set hanging on the Weber grill.
3,Robust tools; hard to clean,"Weber uses a heavy gauge steel for these tools, but the design includes some unfortunate folds in the metal which makes it VERY difficult to clean them. There are better tools on the market."
4,Great tools.,"The tools are great. I'm happy with the purchase. There haven't been many uses for the fork. Sometimes, I lose the grip on the food with the tongs and it would be helpfull if they had some rounded teeth on the end to help with the grip on the food. I'm sure I'll have these tools for a long time."
5,Well made and sturdy,"This is the best set of grilling utensils I've ever owned. They're well-made, sturdy, and long enough to keep me from getting burned by the grill. These are well worth the purchase price."
5,Stainless and flawless,I was very impressed when I first received the items. I thought they may have been a little pricey but they turned out to be terrific. They are much more sturdy than the cheaper models and are easy to clean.
3,Disappointed,"After reading several reviews, I ordered this set. It is made out of very nice material and looks great. The fork has dull tines and it is nearly impossible to get a grip on anything with the tongs. I'm disappointed because I have two Weber grills which have given me excellent service over the last 25 years. This tool set just doesn't measure up to the product quality I expect from Weber."
4,Excellent book for some people,"I loved this book myself. Bert writes like he is talking to you as a friend and explaining his personal journey of self- discovery and recovery from alcoholism. Bert does not present a guide to quit drinking, he does not give a formula to follow, he does not claim to know all the answers and that he is right and others are wrong. He simply shares his story, he shares what he has learned through research, presents scientific facts about alcoholism, and provides many THOUGHT PROVOKING QUESTIONS. That is why I loved this book. It really made me think and explore questions it never occured to me to ask. Bert does talk a lot about AA and God, which some may consider offensive. I did not, even though I do not like AA. I saw Bert's talk of AA as his sharing his story, and even though I do not like AA, I did not let this intefere with learning from this book."
5,"Honest, humorous and uplifting book written from the heart!","Life is not always as it appears. Especially for the outwardly successful person staring into the bottom of another drink, pondering the quality and meaning of life - and discovering none. Honest, humorous, and uplifting, this book lights the path for both the romantic and the pragmatist, blending intriguing stories with startling facts. And most of all, on turning the last page, you will be left with the feeling that you've spent time with a caring and kind friend."
5,A must read for those questioning their alcoholism,"Bert Pluymen, in his book ""The Thinking Person's Guide to Sobriety"", brings forth a wealth of information on alcoholism that is both humorous and fascinating. He calls alcohol's bluff and depicts it for what it truly is - cunning, baffling, powerful! If you are struggling with the idea of whether you are or aren't an alcoholic, pick up this book and honestly see if you find yourself between the pages. A book I couldn't put down and wished it would never end!"
1,The Highest Bottom Drunk Ever,"If you are at the top of your profession, totally successful, financially secure, surrounded by hot babes, driving a Porsche, AND you have a desire to stop drinking, this is your book. Wait, on second thought, that is the whole book. You can read this review or blow $12 and read the longer version. Your choice."
5,The Thinking Person's Guide to Sobriety,Good info for someone who has NOT hit rock bottom and doesn't want to...for someone who may be in denial about heading down that path...
1,What was he thinking?,"I thought this book would offer an alternative to the many ""Recovery"" strategies out there. Nope. It's all about AA. Yawn."
1,Bert's Book Stinks,"Not helpful. Not funny. Poorly written. And he's trying to flog it now on free Internet chat sites, apparently attempting to unload the unsold copies he has with curling yellowing pages in his garage and/or a rented storage locker. Avoid it at all costs. Reads like a dry drunk who still can't comprehend a sober world."
2,Great Idea but....,This book was a really great idea and it's needed but it needs revision badly. A lot of things have happened since the mid 90s and many of the addresses and phone numbers are seriously out of date.
2,not much to talk about,"This item is STUPID SMALL, It is OK for a ""touch up"" on a sharpened blade as long as the metal isn't very good. It won't touch a good blade and is way to small for any serious sharpening."
3,Fine for small chips,"Too small for anything with a blade over 2 or 3 inches, but works well to remove small chips and to polish up edges"
4,Good and Small,"this sharpening stone arrive 2 days before which was a good thing, i like the fact that it is small and compact. i was sharpening my new knife that i bought with this item and it work like a charm because the knife was a little dull but and once i used the stone it gave it a find point which i cut myself with just to see how sharp it was."
4,Good stones!,"While these are very small sharpening stones they are still great stones for carrying in a bug out, hiking, or camping rig. Ultra lightweight they do the job. The covers for them snap together and may not last, but they are just the thing for touching up a fillet knife, or hunting blade."
3,Good to go,Although this is a small sharpener it does the job well. I have used it twice since purchasing it and have found it to be a very useful pocket sharpener.
3,"Cheap, but functional","This is Made in China. It's functional, but that's about it. Don't rely on the snap-lid to stay in place in every possible circumstance. It's nearly too small to be usable. I keep mine in the holster with my camp hatchet and it works great to touch up the edge from time to time.No substitute for a good stone."
4,Compact,"This is a good wet stone. Granted, it's not the highest quality, but it gets the job done, and is perfect for touch-ups on slightly dull knives."
4,Good For Price,"For my first sharpening stone it was very easy to use and worked great on my small Swiss Army knife, and my medium browning knife. Edge was sharp and easily cut throught everyday items.Shipping: Arrived faster than ETA.Pros: Price, Portable, Good quality, keys chain attachmentCons: smaller than expected, different color than picture, harder to use with knifes over 6 inches."
4,really surprised how well it worked,"really didn't have much hope that this would be a good stone but it is!put an edge on my Gerber as soon as I got it and damn!a little small, but it's better than nothing in the woods."
3,Cool Key Chain,I went on a sharpening binge and also scooped up this G.I. sharpening stone for emergencies. I have only tried it once so I can't say how effective it truly is(the knife i tried it on was in bad shape). Only drawback is its size.
5,Small light weight great for bug out bag!,Product was as described very happy with this little stone. Sharpens knives well. Great for bug out bag fishing or huntingGreat fast shipping will do business in the future.
2,Size does matter -lol,"Ok I cannot rate this based on quality of the stone as I have yetto use it. It arrived a few days ago , and when I opened the package I thought I had been ripped off.This thing is almost thlength of my pinky.And about an 1/8"" to 1/4"" wide I would say.Although there are + to not being heavy or bulkyfor packing it in your bag , I would be much happier if it was atleastan 1"" wide & 5 "" long.This is a keychain size sharpener & I estimate that sharpening will be a chore sinceeven my Swiss army knife is bigger than this"
2,Boring!,This book has great ideas but it was very boring and we barely used it in class. It all depends on your teacher though and how they incorporate it into the classroom.
4,Very good progressive metal CD.,"If you like Dream Theater, Fates Warning, and Divine Regale then you'll certainly enjoy the latest release from Elegy. The album provides much enjoyment and variety throughout. Intricate guitar licks and technically superior playmanship abounds."
4,Great for any cigar less than 7 inches.,"Title says it all, Looks good, protects your cigars, I do use it for the 7 inch cigars and it is just Ok for ones that long."
5,Awesome case,This case is awesome. It will fit 3 of the smaller ring gauge cigars and will hold at least 2 60 ring gauge cigars. The Spanish cedar is great and holds humidity very well. Has a nice tight closing fit.
2,this is not a toy,"it is what it was, nothing listed said it would only hold up to a 53 ring size, caz I like the 56-60 ring size, so can't carry 3... and 2 60's get crushed...my bad for not looking at the item closer...yet it also doesn't seal well and slips apart to easy, I need not go on, i made a mistake...just read and know what you need, before you order..anything..."
5,Go Mix is awesome!,This is the first high protein product that I've had that really crunches and satisfies. My recommendation is Toffee Crunch!
5,Part of the core curriculum for life.,"This book is appropriate for any human with a heart. Beg, borrow, buy or steal; please, find a way to read it. I purchased a copy for all of my closest friends and loved ones."
3,The author raises two questions I'm pondering,"The author argues that compassion is an evolutionary strategy and that we are hard-wired for compassion, but that compassion can be nurtured. He makes his arguments through stories and ""field notes.""I'm pondering two questions posed by the author:""The focus on another person's satisfaction becomes a lodestone that paradoxically draws us closer to our own (Isn't most envy just our own potential disowned? We are jealous of what we ourselves might become.)"" - page 197In speaking about consumption, he writes, ""From that standpoint, isn't that connection love itself? Isn't it love itself that underlies all wanting? Don't we only consume the Earth in our hunger for a love already abundant in our own hearts - and waiting in each other's""? - p. 304"
1,Difficult to read,"I found it difficult to even complete the first chapter because of the verbose style of writing. There are so many euphasims, comparions, tangents, etc. that the message is somehow overshadowed and it makes it difficult to recall the main point the author was trying to make. Not sure who the author's target audience was, but reading like this was worse than any graduate level text or professional journal that I have ever read."
5,Stellar Product,Great sprinkler spike/base! Well constructed and easy to use. Brought all those sprinkler heads with bad/broken spikes/bases back to life.
2,"Great price for toothbrush, but replacement heads a [mistake]","You'll get a great toothbrush at a decent price, but in the long run, you'll pay through the nose. ... the replacement heads are a huge ripoff. Is this their strategy for offering the unit at a bargain basement price? In addition, it's a poor design to have to replace the entire 3"" brush attachment. Why didn't they design it so that you could just pop in a new brush on the tip of the head? Environmentally, quite a faux pas. Other than that gripe, the toothbrush is like others have stated: your teeth feel cleaner and you feel like you paid better attention to the task instead of mindlessly bouncing a regular toothbrush around the inside of your mouth. It's easy to develop a methodical procedure that ensures that all tooth surfaces get some attention."
2,What! no replacement brushes?,"Well, I have been on the verge of ordering this item for several weeks now, but I keep on noticing that nobody has the replacement brushes for it! I am wondering if this isn't something that they are gonna drop and are just unloading stock."
2,Replacement heads,I like the toothbrush but cannot find replacement heads anywhere. Is this toothbrush still being sold in Canada???
1,Impossible to find replacement parts,"We used these to replace our valve system three years ago. One of the diaphragms started leaking and Orbit has changed the design enough that the new diaphragms won't fit the old valves. To make matters worse, they use the same item number for the new design so it's impossible to search for the older parts. If you install these, buy several extra diaphragms and solenoids so you don't have to replace the entire valve when the parts fail."
5,Makes a great potato gun,"This is a great product. It is one of the necessary parts for a pneumatic potato gun. The model I purchased was nice 3/4"" but next time I'll get a bigger valve like 1"" or 2"" for a larger release."
2,Hurts to Wear,These are too bulky to suit me. The are very uncomfortable inside the shoe. I had to remove them pretty quickly because the part that hits the middle of my foot felt like I was walking with a pebble in my shoe. Dr. Scholl's makes another one that is red that is sold on this site and it is softer and much more comfortable.
3,Animal Enzymes,"I purchased this product for my cat that constantly throws up after eating. Added this product to her food and she wouldn't touch it. So don't really know if it works or not. Used it for a week, and she wouldn't eat the food with it in - so quit it all together."
2,didn't seem to make a difference,"I got this product for my 2 cats (one is a kitten) and dog, who have loose stools on occasion. The veterinarian had recommended I get probiotics, so I found this stuff which will work for all my animals. I have used almost the entire bottle up now, but have not noticed any difference for the cats or dog."
4,works better than other products I've tried,It works better than anything I've tried so far although my IBD cat still gets soft stools off and on.
5,Unique book from a first generation student,"Shihan Smith (9th dan Isshinryu) is one of the few still living AND teaching first generation students of Tatsuo Shimabukuro (1908-1975), founder of Isshinryu Karate-do.This is the only book written by one of the ten -real- first generation American students. An unique and historical valueable document.First hand facts on the Original Isshinryu karate system. Not, like most of the available books on Isshinryu karate, from hearsay and/or second or third generation Isshinryu karateka."
5,Best Yoga book ever. 3 copies lent out. None returned.,"Jess Stearn takes us through his exploration of yoga using a middle-aged, somewhat skeptical, Western writer's approach to this ageless Eastern discipline. This is not a theoretical discussion or scholarly dissertation. Stearn actually spent 3 months living with Marcia Moore and her husband at their ashram in Concord as a resident student. During this time, with infinite patience and good humour, Moore taught him the physical, mental, and spiritual benefits of yoga, and Stearn despite his initial doubts became a loyal convert. Stearn is an excellent and interesting writer. The book includes 3 sets of exercises for beginner, middle, and advanced stages, and the exercise positions are well illustrated. I only wish it was still available in hard-copy. I only have one of my original 4 Bantam paper-backs left. The other 3 were lent out and never returned"
1,A dangerous book.,"In the late 60s I read this book and was enthralled with it. I did the exercises and have to admit that got me through my PhD comprehensives. However, Hatha Yoga got me into the New Age Movement, where I spent 16 devastating years. Much as I thought I was approaching wholeness and peace, I was being torn apart inside and becoming very self-centered. My interpersonal relationships were full of conflict.I note that one of the other reviewers noted how self-centered this author is. That is what I became during those years, full of myself. Everything was me, me, me.So I have to say that with hindsight I think this book and the practice of Hatha Yoga is very dangerous."
5,Blacalicious got funk for the future fillin'up fiends finaly,"Blacalicious (gift of gab and chief excell) really came through with this album. Despite the resources made available to solesides at the time, Blackalicious created a very well produced album. The beats are phat and the gift of gab never ceases to lyricaly blow my cerebral cortex into the outer realms of space.As a huge fan of underground hip-hop I highly recomend this album!"
3,"No recipes from Bubba Gump's Restaurant, but OK","My husband and I are big fans of the Bubba Gump's theme restaurants, and I was at least hoping some of their recipes or near matches would be in this book. In this I was dissapointed. However, several of the recipes look tasty none the less. I noted with some amusement that every recipe in the book calls specifically for whole, tail-on, unpeeled shrimp - and then the first instruction is to peel and devein! I have no love for this task, so I will certainly be subsituting pre-peeled shrimp. Somehow I don't think the recipes will suffer for it!"
4,fish and fish tales,The recipies were easy and delicious. The pictures were pretty much right on not a lot of fofo to make it look good. We also enjoyed the suttle use of Mr. Gumps wisdom troughout the book.
3,Not the restaurant's recipes ):,"I ordered this book thinking it was a book of the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company"" RESTAURANT'S recipes. It is not. Just a bunch of shrimp dish recipes. Haven't tried any yet. Perhaps I should have read the description a little better."
3,No grits!,Very disappointed that their Shrimp & Grits recipe was not in the book. However that are many recipes that chould be fun to try.
4,"Great Book, lacking a shrimp/spinach dip reciepe.","Great book, I use it all the time. I've used ever reciepe at least twice. I was just disappointed because a friend of mine has a cookbook she order from the movie that has a shrimp dip w/spinach in it. I bought the movie but I didn't have an order form in my video cassette box. But if you like shrimp every way you can think of then this is the book for you."
5,DELICIOUS!!!,"If you like seafood, if you LOVE shrimp, this is the cookbook for you. Every recipe in here is scruptious, delicious, mouth watering. And the reference to the movie are heartwarming. A wonderful gift, a prized possession"
5,Inspiring DVD!,"This DVD, ""The Art of Living Food"", is beautifully produced, and the recipes are clearly and gracefully presented. I like the way it begins with an emphasis on simplicity and moves to more complex dishes. Perhaps as important as the valuable guidance on preparing raw food is the serenity that Ronnie and Minh both express. They validate my hope that a raw food lifestyle will yield that supreme benefit: more inner peace."
5,One of the very best,"While Hendrix was still dreaming up Electric Lady Land he hung out with these guys in the studio. He was blown away by what he heard. This album is cut from the same cloth as Electric Lady Land, Sgt Peppers, The Wall, etc...A timeless masterpiece... I had it when it came out new, and my buddies and I were stunned.... all these years later it is still stunning."
3,"It was the best of vacs, it was the worst of vacs.","And because of this, it gets three stars. Everybody liked using this thing because of the mesmerizing red/green clean light feature. It was great to be told when to move on from a dirty spot. It moved gracefully and was a joy to use overall.And then, the belt came off. And then it came off. And came off. And...you get the picture. And I know this is not unusual for this model. So, we're bailing. I have a Thermax canister as well that's terrific for cleaning, but like calf-roping to use."
1,Hoover Self Propelled Vacuum,"I purchased two of these machines, one for home, one for my office. Both of them malfunctioned within a couple of months. I returned the one for the office after it blew up the first day. The second machine blew up yesterday. It was two months old. These are the worst vacuums I've ever seen. Three broken machines in three months. I don't advise anyone to buy them."
1,Most expensive and worst!!,"If I could, I'd give this vacuum cleaner NO stars. It is the most expensive and worst vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. The belt keeps slipping off, and burning, needing to be replaced almost every time I use it. The only decent feature is that it is self-propelled"
2,"Great one year, okay the next, died the third.",Wonderful the first year! So happy to have something that worked. I didnt mind the weight of it. Then....the clogs started. I had the machine serviced....but just didn't seem to pick up quite the same. Cleaned the brush....replaced the belts....etc. Then the Self-propelled feature wouldn't turn off. Red/Grn light feature stopped working. Last week - practically sparked/popped and fizzled. Sigh. So...we are out looking again. I will try the Eureka and see if I get any better satisfaction. This Hoover wasn't meant to be a family vacuum - perhaps meant for a small apartment?
1,Breaks down ALL THE TIME!! Expensive Bags!!,"I have the same problem described by others - the belt either slipping off or breaking frequently, and that burning rubber smell. It sounds like many of these folks are writing a review just a few weeks after buying it. The troubles begin a few months after that. Also, those replacement Y bags are expensive and not easy to find other than at Hoover. They fill up fast too! I don't mind taking off the four screws to take the bottom plate off, but it is a chore to get the wide belt back on. Let alone buying the replacement belts every other month."
5,beautiful,The bowl and pasta bowls were beautiful and the colors were very vivid. The blue was like the ocean and green was the color of green in the Spring! They were a gift and the recipient said they loved them as well.
4,Dramatic clash of epic armies,"The DL series was a huge leap forward for TSR - these modules featured a new emphasis on drama and storytelling that made the gaming MUCH more fun and involved for the PCs and the DM. Of course, at heart, being TSR modules from the 80s, they're still dungeon crawls! In this chapter, the entire drama unfolds as the great wars of Krynn are fought out at last - all of the most notorious villains, legendary heroes, and mighty dragons clash here, and it's up to you and your players to determine the future of a world! A sprawling campaign set for high adventure."
4,Weber 9891 Rotisserie,"Great product. Well made, and easy to assemble. My only complete is that for the price, why doesn't Weber design the product so that it can be easily converted from the basket to a standard rotisserie.DW"
2,Nice but....,"$80 for this? Seriously overpriced. If you can find something cheaper buy it, this is not worth 80 bucks. Clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping. Worked well with ribs."
1,poor option,This has been a disappointment becasue you have to take ALL the grates out of the grill to use it. So you get your lovely rotisserie chicken and.............nothing else.
5,Weber 9891 Gas Barbecue Rotisserie,"I have had many different types of barbecue rotisseries over the years,but none has done the job as well as the Weber 9891 rotisserie.The best thing I like is the basket type of holding device which does not permit the meat to fall of when it shrinks,also you don't have to use a ball of string to tie the meat on. I certainly recommend bying the Weber 9891.James McCoy"
2,Poor engineering,"This seems like a great idea - the food is held in a basket, so that you don't have to shove a skewer through the meat. However, the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand. If you have a sizable chicken, you cannot tighten these enough by hand. I had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once. Then you have to tighten them with pliers, but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times, and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless! Again: hand tighten = chicken falls out; tighten with pliers = threads are stripped. Now I have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from Weber. Good luck!"
1,Wish I'd Read the Negative Reviews More Closely,"While I love my Weber Grill, Weber should be ashamed of this product!1. Design requires you remove all grates and warming basket to use. Gee, guess they never thought I might cook chicken / roast AND want to do a hot dog too.2. Too much work to use - cleaning means disassembling - and you have to use an adjustable wrench - not part of my normal kitchen tool kit. Too many pieces, not well thought out."
4,Not Compatible with Weber Q 200 Silver Portable Propane Gas Grill!,"Just to make sure people don't make the same mistake I did, be aware that this is NOT compatible with the Weber Q 200 Silver Portable Propane Gas Grill. Amazon.com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the Weber Q 200, so it is Amazon that deserves a low rating so I have just given this the current average of 4 stars."
5,Well designed weber rotisserie,This rotisserie is very easy to place items on and they seem always to be balanced and secure. No problems with items falling of if placed with tight wing nuts. Easy to clean also.
4,"nice big gun, but a bit overated","since this was not clarified in the rule sheet that came with it, nor do they have an updated FAQ on the attacktix website, i had to ask this question directly to hasbro. you can only target 1 thing with this vehicle per turn. if you knock over that target with your first shot, the other three are useless. otherwise, this is a decent piece, mostly hard to knock over, but i have seen it get taken out with 1 shot from a force user."
3,Dr. Scholl's Fungal Nail Revitalizer is a product ...,"Dr. Scholl's Fungal Nail Revitalizer is a product made to help people with problem toenails. The box contains a tube and a nailbrush. The nailbrush should be a little larger than it is. The way the product works is, you squeeze out a small amount of medication onto the infected toe, then use the brush to rub it in. You do this daily. The tube isn't very large, and it would take multiple tubes of medication to actually repair your nail. Treatment would be costly, because you'd have to buy numerous tubes to complete the treatment. Results should be seen after a few weeks of use. I've been using the product for almost two weeks now, and I see very little difference."
2,"To be fair, this product should be used ...","To be fair, this product should be used for three weeks or more. So far, I'm not really that impressed with the results. My toenails do look a tiny bit better, however, That may be I use the brush on them everyday. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone. Save your money for a prescription. One thing I liked was that the cream didn't have any fragrance."
4,I offered this product to a friend who ...,I offered this product to a friend who had stubborn toe fungus. There was a noticeable difference in just a short amount of time. She's anticipating the problem to completely go away with continued use of this product.
3,thinner...?,"It's okay, but I wished it was thinner. The bulky feel of it makes it uncomftable to use and get use to."
2,ok but,"Love the pants but hate the snap closure. Will not stay closed. Should have been a button, as then I could fix it.The pants themselves are a bit tight, so get a size up."
1,Beware of Dangerous Cracking!!,"I have had this teapot for approximately nine months. Prior to that I had another Brown Betty teapot, purchased elsewhere, for a little over a year. I love the look, the history, the taste. Everything. But there is definitely a problem with these pots. Out of nowhere, they develop dangerous cracks. (I don't know how to add a photo to this review, sorry) It's inexplicable to me how this could happen twice, unless there is a serious problem with the product itself. All I do with it is brew a daily pot or two of tea. After each use, I rinse it out with some warm water and place it back on the shelf for the next day. Then one day I'll notice a large crack or several large cracks that weren't there before. So, be warned: this is evidently a problem with the product, at least from my anecdotal knowledge of it."
1,Teapot chipped upon arrival,Hi:Unfortunately the teapot was chipped upon arrival. Wondering how I should go about it and set up a replacement
1,Brown Betty Bad Betty,The glazing on this tea pot started to crack within five weeks of our using it. This is very disappointing and totally unacceptablely poor quality. We have had and used Brown Betty tea pots for over 30 years and never had this problem.
2,Not what I expected,"First the package arrived at the recipient, damaged. The lid was broken. The recipient called the company who sent another in replacement, but they sent a different size. I am waiting to find out if the original order has been processed correctly. This was a gift for some friends, so I am more than a little embarrassed that they are having to deal with all the service issues"
1,Leaky Brown Betty,"Being British I thought this teapot would be the best after trying many others. It was ordered in great anticipation. But oh dear. Betty has a big problem. The tea comes gushing out of the spout and goes where ever it wants and usually misses the cups.Also the tea got cold very quickly. So she is retired and made into a plant holder after only a couple of weeks. Now we have found a good solution, we make tea in a coffee brewer. It tastes the same and the warmer keeps it hot.Nice knowing you Betty!"
1,Beautiful Betty--cracked,"I have been shopping for a teapot that would be practical for daily use--so no teapots that are just for show; I already have those. I finally settled on this Brown Betty 6 cupper. It is substantial, traditional and looks great on my counter.But after a few months, cracks spread all over the glaze and tea started leaking. I have never had this happen with any teapot."
1,They don't make 'em like they used to,"Glaze became crazed the first time we used it, teapot is light for its size (1lb 4oz), spout chipped, and then lid broke when lightly dropped on counter. A poor product we've since replaced with a 40-year-old Brown Betty that is in much better shape, heavy for its size (2lb 7oz), with thicker glaze and a sturdier spout and lid."
2,Disappointed Brit!,"I asked for one of these for a wedding present and I was thrilled to receive it.However, this is definitely NOT the Brown Betty teapot of old. It crackled (or ""crazed"" as I believe it is called) withing the first couple of months. Then, 1 year later, a hole appeared above the spout and it dribbled from the word go (an absolute no-no for a Brown Betty). I don't know who makes these now, however, it can't be the same people who made the one my mother had for my entire childhood without so much as a chip or paint crackle. Very disappointed."
1,Dreadful Quality,"I have gone through two of these teapots. After the first became unusable I figured perhaps I'd just received a pot from a bad batch, so I bought another. Within a few months of use (several times a week)just like the first, the second pot crazed to the point that tea leaked from it. It's such a shame the company manufacturing these has allowed the quality of an iconic item like the Brown Betty to degrade to such a level."
2,Only one problem with this teapot,"The Brown Betty teapot it ok, but it has a problem - it cannot be filled all the way, since the spout is lower than the top - hot water spills out out the spout when it is filled to the top. Other than that, it's fine."
3,Not so brown betty,"I purchased a brown betty tea pot from this company. It did arrive on time but was poorly packed. The tape was loose and coming apart on the package. The contents were loosely packed. It appears that the packager placed the pot with the lid on it into the box, filled it with styrofoam peanuts, taped it shut and shipped it. When I got it the lid was off the pot, had a chip inside. The packing was in the pot and the lid was loose upon the top of the remaining packing. Upon inspection of the pot, I discovered that the pot was of inferior quality, the glaze was not completely around the inside of the pot, it had a big bare spot about the size of a silver dollar. I did not send the pot back because of shipping hassles living in a rural community. I will from now on take the time to drive into the city 65 miles away from my home to make this type of purchases. I will continue to purchase books from AMAZON."
5,Great Pot of Tea,This has been a great buy. There is enough tea for a couple of cups or if your like us large mugs. It maintains it's heat and pours cleanly. Tea steeps evenly and does not pick up prior flavors.It's a must have if you enjoy your tea.
2,Big Brown Betty pot,"Beautiful finish and feel. A real beauty. However, for me a complete waste of money because it does not have an internal sieve. I guess it will work to brew teabags but is hopeless for loose tea. It will remain on a shelf to be looked at but not used."
4,Good overview for 96 page book,Like most of the Osprey series books on fortifications this one provides a very good introduction to its subject matter in only 96 pages. Very well illustrated with good history on how the walls developed over the course of the Byzantine state's history. The only weak point of the book is its lack of discussion as to how the walls integrated into the Byzantine state's defense plans (on the stragegic level) as well as how the walls integrated (on the tactical level) with other branches of armed forces in terms of a defensive strategy. Also no discussion on strategies (tactical or strategic) dealing with withstanding sieges. Hence four stars instead of five.
3,It works - but check the power lead!,"It failed to work initially. After reading the other comments, I too noticed that the power lead from the battery pack was swopped around. A simple swop of the wires in the pcb connector (small screwdriver needed) and the unit jumped into action - luckily no damage occurred with the reverse voltage, although the transistor did get warm!"
1,Avoid products from SIlver Dolphin,"I spent this morning building the door alarm project with my son. We were both hugely disappointed to find that it didn't work. Fortunately I am an electronic engineer and was able to diagnose the problem - the pre-wired connecter from the battery compartment had the red and black wires transposed which meant that the circuit board had been irreparably damaged. I shall get a refund for this product but this will not make up for the wasted hours and the disppointed look on my son's face. I tried to email the publisher, Silver Dolphin Books, but email to them bounces - I suspect that they have either gone bankrupt or simply don't care about their defective products or hearing from their customers. To be fair I should add that this would be a decent product if it weren't for the poor quailty control which resulted in a totally negative experience for my son and myself."
1,Missing pages,"The book came as described as a copy of original text. However, the book was missing 23 different pages making this book largely unusable. The following pages were missing: 102, 103, 130, 131, 162, 163, 184, 185, 196, 197, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 232, 233, 268, 269, 300, 301, and 316. Buyer beware."
1,Yet another X-Files Snoozer,"Oh dear, Oh dear, is there room on the X-files bandwagon for this latest `unofficial` Hickson biography. In one word `no` actually `no,no,no..please no` would be more appropriate. This book re-hashes for the umpteenth time one of the stars of the X-Files. All the things you never knew (or cared) about `hunky` David Duchovny is all there from excruciatingly boring childhood all the way to the present day, and in reading it seemed a looooong time believe me).Hogwash in its purest form. The truth maybe `out there`but Hickson would not know it if it snatched him away and performed experiments on his private parts"
1,The Capture of Bigfoot.,"So easy an caveman can do it! I would like to capture the time wasted on this movie, What is it with troma and netflix? is there a special deal to stream totally horrible movies?"
3,The REAL Bigfoot,"It was announced on the F/X Channel that the actor who played Bigfoot was actually the late professional wrestler Stan ""Plowboy"" Frazier, who became famous in the WWF as Uncle Elmer. I have verified this fact with his widow."
5,Great Shipper!,Ordered this as I wanted a copy for historical research. The local Library had it in their vault and I was not able to check it out.Shipper sent it immediately and I got it in two days.Highly recommend this person and their product.
3,Good Primer on Black Hawk Helicopter,"A high glossy paper/photo book, this reads a lot like a manufactuers pamphlet...you will not find any criticism of the UH-60 in here. It's good, fast reading with many excellent color photos and details that would be very helpful to a modeler.In 94 pages, the author gives you a brief overview of each version of the famous cargo helicopter of the US Army, the Black Hawk. I see this as a very enjoyable book for someone starting out with an interest in helicopters or as a supplement to other books that are more ""nuts and bolts"" or statistics and data oriented.Affordable, nice to have on your bookshelf."
4,Good tool for stuff you don't want to chew up,"I bought this not so much as to deal with cannon plugs, but to give me something that would allow me to take apart certain things that would not chew up the chrome or paint of something nice. It does the job well! For those of you who work with classic cars or custom motorcycles this is a must have item. A pair of vise grips and rag can't compare."
3,Doesn't work for anaerobic (gram positive) bacteria.,"My doctor told me this doesn't work for gram positive bacteria, though i took it anyway just for the urinary relief, and it did it's job."
5,Very good product.,"This is very easy to use. Make sure to measure the spurs and beard(s) prior to weighing. Takes all the guess work out of scoring your bird. Should eliminate all the squabbles you and your hunting buddies may have about ""who shot the biggest bird!"" This is a very fair and impartial judge!"
5,still have it,this little grill was really inexpensive and it just keeps on kicking.it cost the same amount as the normal black webber version but was happy and silly to brighten the day.it fits in teh car easily for camping trips (handy in places where fires are not allowed)and cooks up a great grilled version of anything you grill.
5,Funny and Sincere,"Bruce Beresford has such a great touch. Jane Fonda gives AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE. So funny, so life-affirming. Jane should receive a Golden Globe nomination for this! Maybe even an Oscar. Seriously, she's that good. And some hilarious moments to boot."
3,Not a great movie,I tried to like this but it was just not very good. I gave it as a gift and my mother in law who likes Jane Fonda was not impressed.
2,Misunderstood is the best description I could gie,Got a good idea of how I'll do my hair when I'm old. Jane Fonda looked great but otherwise boring and predictable
1,Defective DVD,"I bought Peace Love and Misunderstanding, Thanksgiving weekend went to watch it for the first time and got 1/4 way through movie and it kept hanging up, looked at DVD and there is a bad spot, tryed couple times, different player still did not work, how can I go about getting it replaced for a new one?Nevermind no response bought another"
4,Very entertaining,"Was a good movie, entertaining. Always love Jane Fonda! Not a master piece but good. Good ending and funny too."
4,Fun film,"Enjoyable movie. While a bit predictable, the acting was good and of course I love Jane Fonda in anything she does"
2,Not for animsl rights activists,"Too much death and murder of animals. Plot was predictable and the acting was poor at best. I was hoping it would be funny, but was sadly disappointed."
5,Film that you must see,"It is a very interesting to see, you think about it even thew the film is finished. You can find your self in each character. Olsen is great in the film, but what can we say about Jane Fonda, ""merveilleuse""."
4,Cute movie,"With a (former) hippy Mom and an up-tight daughter, how can you not enjoy a bowl of popcorn and this movie. It's defiinately not high drama, but there are a few scenes that may make you stop and think abput the sopciety we live in.Good cast"
5,"Peace, Love and Misunderstanding.",A great movie I could watch again and again. Shows how differences can be resolved with love and understanding. It depicts the mind set of the hippie movement.
4,Good movie,"Interesting characters, a good storyline, and funny at times too; this was more of a drama than a comedy, and had a good moral to the story."
2,Disappointed,"Considering the cast, I was disappointed in the simplistic approach to what could have been a very thought provoking vehicle for conversation. Mother/daughter conflict...please give me something that can help me navigate that divide."
4,Pretty good flick,"Jane Fonda is so beautiful. That is what I really took away from this film. Although, it is entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Keener is great as always and the plot is interesting enough to keep the viewer engaged."
3,Lighthearted Unrealized Romp,"Fonda's ""ultimate hippy"" role overshadows the dour Keener interpretation of responsible lawyer...in this family fantasy much of which is utterly unbelievable. These fine actors never leave the ""cookie cutter"" in response to the very real travails of their lives...pity!"
3,I expected more,"It is a nice movie and makes you aware of the different unusual situations that the children of the hippies back in the 60's must have lived and what different reactions they must probably have had and the reasons why. I expected a better story than this one, but it's a movie that entertains in a rainy day or at night if you can't sleep."
1,Don't buy it,"Not clear as blu ray should be, not allowed to repeat chapter or title, doesn't look real at all! Don't buy it"
3,Stress reliever,"I love watching this after a stressful day at work. I'll watch the fish & burn a scented candle for 30 minutes; the video really helps to re-center.The blu-ray is not as vivid as some may demand, ( no where near avatar sharpness)however, it fits the purpose- to de-stress re-energize for the evening."
4,No feeding necessary,"Turns my 55"" into a large maintenance free aquarium. 4 out of 5 seems right. I throw it on when entertaining to have something on the tv that isnt as distracting as tv shows or movies."
3,Not quite what I expected.,I read reviews on this before purchasing- I wanted to get something for someone getting a new TV for Christmas- guess I kinda expected to be blown away by how real the fish looked. But I have to say I suffered from no illusions that I could touch them; or that they needed fed. The fish a pretty and there seems to be a good variety- but it is not something I would have bought had I seen a demonstration first.
4,Good Value for the Price!,4 *'s as this was good value for the price. The only shortcomings were that the power lead was way on the short side and the Infrared heat was barely felt. The massaging effects were good and one could use it all over the body with the handle design with ease. Try it for yourself as $20 cannot even get you in the door for therapy.
2,Recommend a Panasonic over the Homedics in this case.,"This massager doesn't have the weight or the pressure to make it a really great massage tool. I returned the one I bought & replaced it with a Panasonic. Much better. Homedics makes some good products, but this one's a bit light."
5,Big Roars,"This massager works the best when you're watching Big Wars. If you like this massager, you're sure to love Big Wars."
1,Not what I needed,"My camera no longer worked. I thought perhaps the docking station was not charging the battery since a new battery also did not work. I bought this charger hoping it would do the trick. My camera works as long as it is pugged in. But, unfortunately, once disconnected, it no longer works. I bought a new camera, but am having a hard time getting used to it."
4,"Suprising, but it works well","Honestly, it's true that this waffle iron is not as big as it first seems in the picture. I was surprised when I opened the box. But that doesn't take away from the waffles it produces. and the real secret is in what I didn't know it would do. You can reverse the waffle iron non-stick sides, and turn it into a Griddle, or even better a sandwich cooker. The hinge of the waffle iron can lift up and it can perfectly toast a good sized sandwich, which makes it a good multi-use device. As has been said in previous reviews, it is not that large and the waffle portion is not that deep, but if you are looking for a good consolidating waffle iron, this is an excellent tool. If you're looking for an exclusive, supreme waffle iron, look elsewhere."
1,not my last waffle iron,Too expensive for the construction. Unable to create a good waffle due to the thinnest of the waffle plate indentations. I will keep trying to succede.
5,"Excellent Waffle Maker, I enjoy it every day",My wife and I enjoy well made and delicious waffles every day. This product is very well designed and the price was right!
2,similar to B&K G48TD -- suggest look elsewhere,followed advice of Cook's Illustrated and bought B&D; G48TD -- exactly match for this appliance with different badge.bottom line: very uneven cooking. impossible to make good waffle with even browning across front/back. very frustrating.strongly suggest looking elsewhere for something better. -GA
3,Good large size waffle maker,My son-in-law loves it and it arrived on time for his birthday. It makes a nice crisp waffle for those who do not like the doughier Belgian waffles.
4,Good overall Waffle Maker,"The waffle maker does a good job. Nice waffles. Lacks some of the features of better makers though like a ""done"" light etc. Overall build quality doesn't feel great, but it is sturdy. Edges on some things aren't as nicely finished as you'd see on a cuisinart or so forth. But if you are looking for a functional waffle maker with removable plates so they are easier to wash then this one does the trick. Overall a very good and well priced item."
2,I wish I would have passed on this one,"I have this waffle maker/griddle. I never use the griddle part because it is easier to clean a frying pan and you don't have to worry about grease running onto the counter from the simple pour spout that serves as the grease drainer. The waffles are ok, but they don't get crisp in five minutes like a professional waffle maker. I discovered that I like Belgian style waffle with their deeper chambers much more. So this thing is one of many things that is going to my local thrift store."
1,Definitely not worth the money.,"I am very disappointed in this mattress. My mother-in-law had a similar mattress. (I am not sure of the brand.) It has worked great for years as her guest bed. My husband and I bought this to use in our apartment, when we first moved in and were buying furniture. We used it for about 1 week, inside. Then it was stored in a safe plastic box. The next time we took it out to use it, it deflated by morning. We were planning on using it at my mother's house when we visit overnight. Wherever it is leaking from is not visible. Of coarse, I am way past the date I can return the product to Target. So I am just stuck. No air mattress, and unwilling to purchase another for that cost. I DO NOT recommend you buy this mattress. I sincerely hope that Coleman will be willing to provide a new mattress or a reimbursement. I thought that they were a reputable brand, but this experience is causing me to wonder."
1,"Mmmmmm, another night on the ground","Well, short of writing coleman I think I might be done with these air mattresses. Had one for two years used on 5 occasions and it developed a leak. Bought one of the newer quickbeds loved the design after the first use it developed a leak. Discovered the problem as others have with the ovals that have ""sheet clips"" hole inside that can't be patched. Bummer, is I slept on the ground for three nights during a mojave road trip."
1,LOW beach quality JUNK!,"I dont know whats happened to coleman. There products have taken a nosedive.The vendors need to SPECIFY exactly what model bed your getting. The all brown material former queen was a good purchase. lasted a year or two,This most recent one I received is a green / white material, and thinner in width. This is junk. Already a slow leak upon first use.whats the difference? I have no idea."
4,Good inexpensive option,I bought this to use every day until I can afford to buy a really nice mattress and bed frame. I have had it for a little over a month and it has been great. I sleep well and find that I don't have to refill the bed very often. Even if I had to refill it every day I think I would still be happy with it because the pump takes less than a few minutes to use. I just put a nice duvet on it and it looks beautiful in my studio.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have purchased 2 of these from Amazon over the past year and each time, my guest ended up laid out flat. The most recent one didn't last 1 full night. The air slowly seeped out as soon as I inflated it. I actually had to put more air in it during the middle of the night to keep it inflated. On the second night, all the air seeped completely out and when I attempted to inflate it again, the mattress actually popped. The resulting hole was too big to repair so I sent the mattress back and will not purchase another again.Be forewarned."
3,Gets soft overnight...,"This worked well enough for its first weekend camping, but it was definitely getting soft after a couple nights. I guess I've already got a small leak, somewhere.The valve doesn't quite fit snugly with our Coleman-brand air pump, so it requires at least two hands to inflate (we've got an older quick-bed, its valve fits perfectly).It's so big, it barely fits through the door of our tent. Somebody else mentioned the ""trampoline"" effect of an air mattress this big, and it's true: if one person lifts himself to roll over and then plops back down, then the other ""trampolines"" into the air. Only two very sound sleepers can sleep together on this thing. Maybe we should've gotten two twin-sized airmattresses...And the ""Wrap'n'Roll"" system is just a gimmick. Don't pay extra for it.Ben"
1,Leaks,"Worked great on a two day camping trip, but then I used it a couple of times at home and now it doesn't last a night. We push in the air seal all the way, and our cats are declawed. Now we get to see how good Coleman's warrenty service is, but I'm not holding my breath."
3,got the job done,nice bed for the price not long term use definitely for camping and sleep overs but if you are short on money and need a bed for a few months good buy
4,Thumbs up,"I am pleased with my purchase. It makes wierd noises when you move around on it, but it gets the job done and it's pretty comfy for an airbed. I would recommend it. There were no cleaning instuctions so if you spill something on it use a fabric cleaner like Resolve."
1,flat again!,"This didn't even last a season. I don't know how many air mattresses we have had to throw away because they no longer hold air. What a waste and landfill filler, not to mention miserable nights on the hard ground!"
1,Don't waste your money,"As I shared with my son about the car camping trip my wife and I took the story started with the first night out and the new Coleman mattress deflating twice during the night, he said he had the same experience with his. During the trip I looked around to see the many other Coleman camping products that we use and have for years so I share this story to help others avoid this one product. Our other six nights were saved by none other than the biggest of the big box stores and a battery powered pump up mattress that I would endorse but it does not seem appropriate here on the Amazon site. By the way, Amazon is great on the return and they continue to be our main source for shopping."
1,Worst Product Ever,got punctured hole within one week of use. and the hole size increased within an hour of use. Got it returned and refunded by Amazon. (still awaiting for the refund money :) )P.S.: Amazon customer service was kind enough for taking my request for refunding this.
1,blow up bed,"it leaked when I got it and the seller referred me to Coleman and I sat on the phone for over a half hour with no response from a human being, just the constant reminder of how important I was to them."
5,excellent,used it this past week was very pleased with the confort and the breeze to blow up as well as release the air.........thanks
1,"2 in a row, each didn't last one full night","Sadly, the title says it all. I love Coleman air mattresses- I've slept on them every night for months. I previously bought the one from Costco and had great success. But I have now bought 2 of these lovely brown Quickbeds, two days in a row, and 2 nights in a row now I have ended up on the floor. Costco must sell a higher end one because this Quickbed just isn't cutting it. Boo!"
4,k. winter,I have used this bed a few times visiting in-laws as well as camping and have found it very reliable and comfortable. Just make sure you inflate it all the way.
1,Buyer beware,"I bought two of these mattresses. The first one lasted one night -- hole in the seam. The second one lasted four nights -- hole in the seam. Both were used on carpet in our basement by adults (who are not overweight) with no other obstructions around. I tried to use a patch kit -- didn't work. Of course, I can't find the receipt to send it to Coleman under the warranty, which is the route you're supposed to go if there's a problem. A $60.00 lesson learned."
1,2 for 2 wont hold air.,I don't know if its a bad batch or what but within 3 hours of inflation it needs to be topped off again. This is with no weight on it at all. I returned that one for another and the same issue.
2,"Thin material, no patch kit included","Thin material, no patch kit includedI think that says it all, I don't expect this to last.It will be OK for company at the house but its too thin to expect it to survive camping trips.I have always received a patch kit with this type of blow-up item but none was included."
1,Piece of Crap,Only lasted 3 camping trips and is now toast. 10 nights total. Every day it lost a little more air. Garbage. DO NOT BUY IT!
1,leak in the seam,"The design has numerous pockets and in one of those pockets, the seam gave away and a fully blown bed leaks all its air in 1 hour. Its not like we punctured it or something.Only last 2 weeks. POS.Our cheap Walmart bag lasted for years. Thought I was upgrading.Took it to our local 'authorized seller' for a replacement and we were turned away. The owner couldn't be bothered with these beds since they get so many complaints. He wanted me to ship it directly to them. That will cost more than the bed!So, in addition to have a malfunctioning product, we cannot claim the warranty coz the local authorized store refused to accept the return."
5,SLAMMINJAMMINFREESTYLIN TRUTHS,"you can't even begin to understand how kick this cd is... till you get it in your grubby hands, listen to it a couple of times and the melodies and lyrics and imagination of it all just seeps into you.... a must, ohmigoodness such a must."
1,AHHHHHHH,"[...] MY little sister likes bratz. I think they're stupid. I mean. Ok, they're babies, and they're wearing exessive amounts of makeup. right. whatever. DId you ever notice how big their heads are. Or their shoes. Ok. whatever. Listen to system of a down. Me, out."
3,"oh please people, get over it!","so what if these dolls wear thongs! I bet at least one woman who posted wears a thong, bratz are in fasion, nobody would want one of these if they didn't wear clothes that was in style, get over it! these clothes are in style, it's what girls of today wear, and if the bratz company wants to sell, the clothes they wear must be in style!! get over it dumb ass mom's!"
1,I AGREE WITH (...),THESE DOLLS ARE B-A-A-A-A-D ROLE MODELS FOR OUR GIRLS. USE YOUR BRAINS AND BUY BARBIE. THESE DOLLS ARE HO'S AND THEY ARE TO SEXY. DO NOT BUY THEM THEY ARE BAD FOR GIRLS.
5,These Babyz ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!,No Babyz dress like this but most teens dress like the dollz so STOP CRTICIZING the Bratz!!! PLZ!!!
1,this doll is a disgrace,"thongs? please.. where are your morals at? the respect that woman are suppose to have for themselves. woman have came a long way in this society to be who they are. not to portray themselves as whores, like they were known as back in old society. what you are showing is a degrace to woman. even the older dolls show no morals about being woman, its more showing on how to dress like a hooker. too many women in this world are nieve to the fact of being raped. but dressing like this they'll learn real quick. its all about the money in this world rather than morls and the respest we shoud all have for ourselves. to add, if there is a woman in your manufactering co. that had anything with producing dolls & babys she should turn and look at herself and the own future of her daughters and to where she stands, and not worry about the money that shes making."
5,the cutes and best toy ever!!!!!,"I am 13 years old but I just love to take care of these babyz. I think that this toy gives kids an experience of how to care for there own babyz. I play all the time with my little sister and she is only 3 years old, can you belive that she is being good when she plays with Bratz Babyz Cloe. She never lets any one talk lould when she said that Cloe is slepping. So I just go along with It anyway my mom said that thats cute.Frome: Yoselin TorresHialeah, Florida"
2,Ok mamaduke is very right here.,"I am a 13 year old girl who lives in canada. I live in a not-so-goo enviroment. I see Hookers,Prostitutes and so on. And they dont dress as bad as these little toys. And some of you say ""Kids dont take these as rolemodels"" Well open your eyes ... they do. Sure they are a little piece of plastic ... but Little girls are going to want to be like them. These things are plastic porno. Kids in my 8th grade class Started dressing like this when they were in grade 7. They werar chains, miniskirts,Reaveiling tops, and so on. And the boys are getting in on this too.Who wants a baby in a leather jaket? And a devil duckie? Erm. No.P.S I dont agree with the myscene is better thing. They are just as bad."
5,"Awww, that's adorable!","What is more cute than two dolls in one pack with oppisite personalities, but yet the same? These are adorable."
3,Why?????,"Excuse me, why would two beautiful bratz dollz have a BABY version? That's really silly and it gets at me. I prefer the Roxxi and Phoebe bratz DOLLS better."
2,oh my gosh,ok people a baby would not dress in mini skirts and leather jackets! and would not wear make-up! dont get me wrong i am a brats fan but i think little kids shouldn`t be playing with bratz babies. they are a bad example for little kids! Little kids need to play with barbie and baby dolls and not have to worry about make-up and stuff until they are older!
2,"Good quality, poor performance","Looks great, solidly built to last, but the stream of water is poorly adjusted. Can't get a concentrated stream like you can with most nozzles. I give it 5 stars for construction and appearance, but only 1 star for performance; 2 stars overall. Purchased 11-23-2008."
2,"Poor Water Flow, Lack of Control","Pros- Solidly constructed.Cons- It just doesn't work like you would expect. Water flow seems ""Restricted"". The spray when it's screwed down is not as wide as you would expect and the stream when it's opened up is not as intense.Overall steer clear despite the low price."
3,o.k. nozzle,"This is an o.k. nozzle for most spraying. However, I needed one that gave a small, high pressure spray. This was not the one."
3,Language and the Brain,"I think there was a lot of potential for this book, but think it came up short of my expectations. It is more of a 3.5 than a 3, but I love literature in this area. For spot reading the book is brilliant and informative, and I would not hesitate recommending that someone pick this up (for a reasonable fee) in interested in cognition and language.I enjoyed chapters 4-5-6 all on aphasia. You can walk away after these sections understanding a bit more of a critical issue in the neurosciences/neurophilosophy.I think the Neurocognition of Language (see:The Neurocognition of Languageis perhaps a better read."
2,cheaper elsewhere,"This item, although very good, is much cheaper at CVS. As well as Walgreens and my local grocery store, Publix. Plus it counts as ExtraBucks rewards at CVS>"
5,Good Toothpaste,With this item and my crest white strips my teeth got about 5 shades lighter. To the point people kept coming up to me and asked what i do to keep my teeth so white. Plus i smoke daily so it helped out a lot to brighten my smile.
1,This book is not worth the money,I recently purchased this book and was charge $65.00 total. It was not worth nearly that much money. I am very dissatisfied. I will never purchase from this seller again.
3,Works ok...,"This pump works alright. It is pretty fast for as small as it is. It is a great alternative to hand pumping the mattress up. I however agree with others that it does not make the mattress firm enough. It seems to get to a certain point and it stops filling the mattress. Im not sure if its a safety factor so you dont over fill it... but after using this pump, it still needs to be filled up more manually. If I used it more frequently I would invest in a better, more expensive pump."
2,"Fast, quiet, but weak","This pump came included with the King sized coleman quickbed I purchased. It filled the bed to the point that it *looked* full very quickly and quietly, but like other users, no matter how long I left it on (with fresh batteries) the mattress never got firm. I am returning and shopping for a replacement."
1,Unreliable,"So, what's the big deal about expecting high reliability from a cheap Chinese pump with the Coleman name on it? We just came back from camping. Tent's a set up. Mattress half full and the brand new pump quits. A million miles from nowhere. It's getting dark. I'm more than mad. I expected a whole lot more from a name I've trusted my whole life. I wish I could recommend a good pump for you to consider but have not found one yet."
1,Trash,"This pump came with our Coleman mattress. During the first attempt to pump up that matress during a typical Texan day in May of 97 degrees, the pump literally liquified. After the mattress was almost completely inflated the pump melted around the motor. The damage was not reversable after letting it cool down. The fly wheel did not attach do the motor anymore. The thing became instant trash."
5,Great Pump,"I love this pump because it is rechargeable so I don't have to throw away batteries. It works great, no more hyperventilating!"
2,Not the pump pictured,"this item is the older pump and is not the new pump pictured. pump works fine, but you can find the older model for cheeper."
2,this pump has asthma,"I purchased this item to use with my air mattress when camping. I was very dissappointed with this pump. I used brand new batteries and a brand new mattress when using the pump the first time ...and still the pump struggled to wheeze a few puffs into the mattress. It took a pathetically long time to get any air into the mattress- and once it got to about 65% filled- it seemed to just give up. At that point the air it was losing and the air it was providing seemed to stabilize and nothing could get it to fill anymore.Before this purchase, I owned a more expensive Eddie Bauer air mattress with the pump attached. This worked wonderfully, especially when camping, and I miss it terribly. However, with four cats in the house, even a mountain of protective blankets and other spreads can't save the mattress from the inevitable claw and so I have had to resort to more disposable mattresses. I sure wish someone would make a cat resistant air mattress with a built in pump."
3,Okay but not all it could be.,"I have this battery powered pump and it works, but the electric version will fill the mattress to a much more firm comfort. It would be nice if the pump was AC/DC like a radio, and came with a longer cord and cigarette lighter adapter."
1,Full of hot air,I got the 4D with a queen size bed and went to pump up the bed before I went camping to make sure the bed was ok and the pump worked as well. Unfortunately it didnt work so i called coleman and told them the problem. They had me take a picture of the receipt and they sent me a new one. well the new one i got also had a problem starting but once I got it running after some shacking and pressing of the device it worked. So you are almost better getting a hand pump either way good luck with a product made in china.
1,Simply Junk,"I cant tell you much more than it did not work. I bought new batteries and went camping. The air seemed to come out ok, but it was not strong enough to inflate the mattress. It maybe filled 5%. Don't buy this."
5,Good Stuff,I have had this same one for about 7 years. It works just fine airing up any airup matress. I've used it a couple of times when all you can find is wet or green wood for a camp fire and the fire just wont get going. If you can get just a little coals and then use this to blow on the fire you can keep a fire going all night. The only thing I dont like about it is the bottom does not stay on very well. I just use a small bunjee cord and that works great.
1,CAREFUL - this does not fit all inflatables!!!!!!,"From the photo it looks as though this would inflate most inflatables (beach balls, cheapo air mattresses, pool floats, etc.). But it does NOT. In fact, in will not inflate MOST things.If you are looking for a portable inflator, this is NOT it. Unless you only need it for the matching Coleman mattress."
1,Terrible pump,"I bought this pump for my Coleman mattress (which also failed).The pump worked slowly until the mattress was about 80% full, then slowed down, then stopped, with the mattress still being partially deflated. I could flip the switch off and on and nothing would happen. After a few minutes the pump could be turned back on. I think the tiny motor just kept overheating.I returned the pump, thinking it was a lemon and got a new one, same model. The new one was even worse. Getting 2 bad pumps in a row, I doubt they were both lemons.I don't recommend spending the money on this pump."
1,Defective product,"Bought one of these about a year or 2 ago. This spring, the motor went bad, it developed ""asthma"" as well, and only sputttered to life sporadicly. Checked all the connections , batteries and determined the problem was inside the motor. Figured this was a fluke and ordered another new pump this past spring. Installed the batts and the same exact thing, the motor races, then cuts out, then barely runs at all. Save your money and look elsewhere for a more reliable product. From what I see in the reviews here, Im not the only one who has had this problem either."
2,Get the Rechargeable Quickpump instead,"I got this battery operated quickpump for my twin blow-up bed. It worked ok, but there was not very much air pressure. I felt like the bed was limp, no matter how long I left the pump on. I then purchased the rechargeable quickpump, which is only about $10 more, and it has worked pretty well."
1,Do not buy this pump!,"I bought this pump at Target, brought it home, and it did not work. I thought it was user error, but it simply wouldn't turn on. I went and exchanged it for the exact same thing, and tried that one. The second one seemed to work, so I brought it home. I started to inflate my air mattress and the pump died. Stopped working... If you bang the outside of it, it would slowly gain momentum and start back up but only for a little while. I would never rely on this pump during a camping trip. I am returning this and going with a different brand."
2,This pump blows ... and not in a good way!,"Not powerful enough to fully inflate my queen air mattress. I left it on for awhile, but 1) I had to hold the pump up to the air fill nozzle for more than 10 minutes (not fun). 2) The nozzle didn't properly fit my air mattress, no matter which attachment I tried. I returned this."
1,Didn't make it through the first use,"I bought brand-new batteries for my brand-new pump and started to inflate a mattress. When the bed was about a third full, the pump simply stopped. My husband could get some brief revivals by banging it from the outside - I had no such luck. It took about an hour but we got the mattress ""full enough"" I wouldn't even consider relying on this pump a second time."
4,Works good,I used this during our family campout for our new mattress and it worked just like it should have-nothing special
4,Fini,"Barbara left her characters and her beautifully crafted world in general within the clutches of peril at the end of Knight of the Demon Queen. I was happy to see matters resolved and the book take a more upbeat feel as an open conclusion to this series.Having said that, I would have to say I have had my fill of demon lore. At the end of this novel, Morkeleb has undergone such a stark transformation that I hardly recognize him. For a dragon, being a Dragonshadow means essentially not being a dragon at all. He has abandoned magic and his ""dragon ways."" In fact, he often appears in human form by the time this final installment comes around, and I feel like I lost an old friend of sorts.Nevertheless, I am happy to know Caradoc's fate, and my lovely Aohila's as well."
2,"Great movie, not so great DVD edition!","""Svengali"" is a great movie; the art direction, camera work and lighting is top notch, as is the performance by Barrymore. No bad ratings there - the movie is ace, and should (in my opinion) really be on par with some other classical horror movies like ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" when it comes to popularity and availability!But alas! This so called ""remastered"" DVD edition is, sadly enough, nothing like the movie itself. It's low fare; an ""unfinished"" edition. The sound track is often low or distorted, there are visible marks and spots on the picture in many scenes, and suddenly - out of the blue - a small logo for TCM pops up on the screen. OK, now we understand!NB: My rating of this product may seem a tad high, but I'm slightly torn between my love for the movie, and my disliking of the DVD. So: The movie ""Svengali"" gets 4.5 stars, but this DVD edition gets only 1.5 star."
1,Bad copy?,"Bad copy? I think I may have received a ""bad copy"" of this DVD. The old Svengali DVD I have is MUCH better in picture and sound quality. This one is very blurry and the sound is sub-standard. I already sent my old DVD back to Amazon thinking that this new one would be much better. Wish I would have kept it now. I may actually have to send this copy back. Bummed."
4,Movie=Plus but Dvd=Minus.,"This movie i rate Excellent as far as the dvd goes no way.Scratches + Glitch in Dvd and Low Sound At Start.Am Disappointed and didn't see the TCM logo,so that's good.Nude Scene is a bit Covered in this,come on it's 2010 anything goes.I see this was originally made by Warner Bros.so if they redo it i know it will be good and trouble free.The one thing that you just have to see in this film are,Those Evil Looking Eyes!And what Power he has with them.And this was supposed to be a top rated Roan dvd,Poorly Done.Would not recommend this Roan Version to anybody at all."
3,Visually Intriguing,"John Barrymore stars as a composer and hypnotist who takes control of Marian Marsh through hypnosis and turns her into a great singer and his lover. Barrymore gives a striking performance as the sinister, yet humorous Svengali, sometimes a bit hammy but acting circles around the rest of the cast. The sets and photography are strange, yet stunning, creating an eerie, almost other world feel. There are a number of great camera shots, including a long shot that moves from Svengali's apartment to another building that must have been a real challenge technically back in 1931. It is a very talky film with little action, but the visual presentation of Barrymore and the sets helps to make up for it. It's not a great film, but it does leave an impression."
4,Informative yet not objective,I truly enjoyed reading this concise and informative book. It will take you less than three hours to read. The only thing that disturbed me is the author's clear anti-Israel stance which might be understandable from the authors personal biography but which shouldn't be part of his elaboration on the Druze.
5,pocket guide to musculoskeletal assessment,My daughter is a physical therapist. The book has been on her Amazon wish list for 2 years. She will finially get it for Christmas. She is insistent about the book so it must be a good book.
2,Not Value for Money,"Since the content contains herein are found in most standardtext, & the amount of info is not great, the pricedefinitely does not fit this type of text"
2,Pleasant nostalgic trip to big band 1950s radio broadcasts,"There isn't much available on CD for Johnny Richards. However, this album spans his music from very serious (Cuban Fire) to ""gadget"" numbers with the band singing. This CD cannot stand up to a studio effort like ""Something Else by Johnny Richards"" (not available on CD it seems) but it is very pleasant to invision that you are sitting in a 1956 Chevy convertable on a pleasant summer's evening listening to a band broadcast. They don't seem to do that anymore. Too bad."
3,Eight good cuts,"There are 8 good cuts here & two of them are repeats of the same chart with perhaps slightly different personnel. The good cuts are Band Aide (both versions), Dimples (both versions), El Congo Valiente, Walkin', Afoo, & La Suerte De Los Tontos. Fidelity is about what you would expect from airchecks. Outstanding band, soloists, & charts. Certainly not among the best albums by Richards but 8 tracks of very nice listening."
4,Smooth Beats - Good Driving,"This is my favorite of the four Samurai Champloo releases. The first track, battlecry, is the opening theme for the show and I think it's pretty decent, the last track is the closing theme for the show and it's listenable but I usually skip over it. The rest of the album should be the reason for your purchase though. The songs are just beats but they're all original and great chill music, if you don't mind the repetitive nature of hip-hop beats. I use the discs of the Samurai Champloo series mainly as driving music, good to talk over and fun to drive to. Nothing mind blowing, just plain fun."
3,Stupid little holes,The little bumps that they put on air mattresses for no apparent reason started tearing and caused really bad leaks. The mattress lasted about a year but that was really only a couple of uses.
1,Good for about 6 trips - blew apart at seams,"I liked the mattress at first. It was large and relatively firm and comfortable. After about 6 uses in 2 years, it started leaking from the seams on the bottom. I was able to quickly repair each one with liquid nylon repair and nylon repair tape.Starting in my 3rd season, I blew it up to test it before using it and it totally exploded on the upper seam. I've already thrown it away or I would have video-ed the whole. Basically, an entire circle busted out.We were very careful where we placed the mattress and even put cushioning underneath it. I don't believe anyone would get more than 4 seasons out of one.I decided to go with a much more expensive but reliable (lifetime) Thermarest System -- 2 luxury self-inflating pads coupled together with their down coupler."
5,Coleman Blow Up Mattres,Ordered this product not knowing if it would really be all that it said. GREAT product! Comfy to overnight on and easy to store.
4,"Great bed for camping, if your tent has the space","Very comfortable for camping and plenty of room for my wife, myself, and our infant son. We just bought a very large (16'x7') tent, with plenty of room for the bed, the pack and play and all of our stuff, but this would not fit in our old 4 man tent. Used 4 nights so far and has been pretty good at holding air, but may need a quick refill after first night."
1,"Cheap quality, leaks","Coleman's mattress is deceiving.it looks great, shows velour-like coating on top. seems luxurious.however, it leaked on 1st use.i got an expensive repair kit to close puncture yet when pumping repaired blowup mattress got 2nd leak!very frustrating, cheaply-manufactured product.do not buy.i'm not the only customer with such problem with Coleman.for those of you who had no problems, good for you, but there's enough of us who did.it comes down to this: Coleman should not fools buyers & improve their quality instead, before they defend their product with silly excuses.fact is too many of us have punctures/useless mattresses."
2,Looks beautiful but licking,"I bought this mattress almost 2 month ago and just started to use it. I bought it not for camping but just for my bedroom to sleep on it. I don't like to deal with regular mattresses, cause I always afraid that there could be some bugs.When I just open the box I was really exited, I like the color and size of this mattress. Unfortunately, when I woke up in the morning I found out that the mattress was licking (a lot), and my back was hurt in the morning.Then i decided to find where is that hole, maybe I made it myself by accident. I found one and figured out that it wasn't my fault because if I would make it there would be another hole on sheet, but there wasn't.I always very careful with my things.So I'm very disappointed..."
5,"Quality Product, Great Value","I purchased this product for use in camping applications. It works so well as a camp mattress for my entire family (2 adults, 2 young children) that we have also used it for an extra spare bed when we have had more houseguests than expected. The mattress is comfortable and does not transmit vibrations/motions between sleepers."
2,30 days,"The product has a tendancy to break at the seams after about 3 weeks of use. I bought this product to use as a temporary bed for a house guest and after 3 weeks, the bed developed a leak. Amazon sent me another one to replace it with and this one went 32 days and again, another leak. I can't send it back now since I'm over the 30 day limit. I wouldn't recommend this air bed for long-term use."
2,Kept developing Leaks,"Was great right at first, but just a few days after getting it, it developed a leak around one of the small circles on the bottom of the mattress, so I returned it for a replacement. When the replacement came it developed a leak in the same place. The seams around the coil circles are either not glued properly or just thin on some of the mattresses. I think if you are planning to use this for a one night trip or something similiar they may be okay, but if you or your guest plan on using it for more than a night or two I would definitely recommend something else. I returned the item to Amazon for a refund this time. Thank you Amazon for great customer service. They had no problem with the original replacement or the refund. Both were done quickly and with no complications."
3,Leaking,Had this product for one season. Camped with it the second season & developed a leak overnight while sleeping on it. I wouldn't recommend this product. I ended up purchasing a couple of folding canvas cots to sleep on.
1,Poor Quality,I purchased mattress as a replacement to the same product bought 5 years ago. Coleman changed the materials. The mattress punctured in first week of use. Repaired hole and got another one in different location.
1,Never Coleman air beds again...,"The worst beds I've ever seen. One got a leak after 4 days, another one - in 2 weeks. Will never buy again."
1,Developed leak within three days--twice,I bought one of these and the FIRST time I inflated it there was a hole on the bottom (making it useless obviously)--not sure if it arrived with a hole or if the inflating did it. So I returned it for a replacement. The second one stayed inflated for exactly two nights of use. In the middle of the third night my house guest woke up on the floor because it had developed a hole along one of the seams. I won't be ordering a replacement.
5,great purchase,"This product worked GREAT! It was very easy to blow up and to remove the air. Love the fact it has its own storage case. It was VERY easy to roll up and I am 6 months pregnant. I took it camping and there was LOTS of room for me, my son, my niece. Holds air wonderfully! Had it aired up for 3 days and stayed nice and firm. Great buy."
1,High hopes but not good,"We bought this mattress when we were moving to use it the last night in the old house and the first couple of nights in the new house before our furniture arrived. It was easy to set up, was quite comfortable, and worked well the first couple of nights. An hour into sleeping the third night, however, I woke up with my lower half touching the floor. Not good. We tried pumping it back up but it deflated again an hour later. My husband had to run out to Walmart at midnight to find a replacement!"
2,Very disappointed,"I looked beyond the other reviews that warned that this mattress didn't hold air because a ""king"" size air mattress is hard to find and Coleman is a reputable name. I should have listened - this mattress did not hold air through a night."
3,A good matress for the price - Color gets dirty fast!,Overall this is a good air matress for the price. The king size is a big plus but make sure it fits your tent!Pro's:* Blows up quickly and deflates fast too!* King Size gives you plenty of room for 2 adults or 3 with child* The price is right* Kept air in for several daysCon's:* Our mattress was off white color top that gets dirty very quickly (should be a darker color)* Not the most comfortable bed to sleep on... but it's OK for a few nights.* the attached bag is worthless (never be able to roll the mattress back in bag
1,BAD NEWS,"The service from Amazon was very good. The bed's size, however, was not a King, Queen, Full, nor Twin. It had very weird Length & Width dimensions. It also was not as high as described (shorter by about 2 inches). Amazon quickly sent me a postage paid return label and gave me no static about it. The one thing Amazon failed to do, however, was answer my question regarding if they had any Kings correctly sized that they could ship me. If they had, I would say their service was excellent."
1,busted!!!,the 3rd night on it and it got a leak. dont waste your time getting it online. I've seen them at wal-mart for almost the same. be careful in buying this air matress
4,just what i needed,filled up well and held the air even though we spent the night jumping around on it. both of us slept well also
2,Very superficial,"This book was recommended to me by the folks at the microscopy core in my university. I was hoping for an accessible technical primer on confocal microscopes with emphasis on the hardware and the underlying optical theory. Unfortunately, although there is an introduction to the hardware and a little bit of optics theory, these sections are very superficial and don't really add to your understanding of the technology (you'll be better off reading the the documentation on the manufacturer's websites, especially nikonU). The aim of this book seems to be to make sure you know what buttons to push when you are in front of the microscope, but not necessarily for you to understand what is that you are doing. The book is not bad. I would trade the section on software (that seems dated) for a good introduction to confocal optics and a more complete guide on how to make sure the hardware is optimally set up (key to get good images) which is also lacking."
1,Doesn't work on MAC as advertised in listing,"This is listed on Amazon as working on both Windows and MAC platforms. However, after you receive it, you will learn that is is a WINDOWS ONLY product. BEWARE!"
2,Sub Par Imitation TiGuanYin,"I've had and enjoyed the TGY tea in the past so I knew what to expect. This tea was disappointing. The flavor is too strong and of a rather rancid quality. The leaves were very dried out and there was much powder in the tin. This is certainly not authentic TGY, the flavor is quite far off the mark. Other tea's I've under the label ""Golden Dragon"" have been less then spectacular imitations of other famous Chinese teas. This is by far the worst. I now avoid the all Golden Dragon label tea, it is low quality"
1,low quality,This is a cheap tea imported to the western market with a big markup. It is very strong and almost approaches a low quality black tea.
1,Don't buy it!,"Horrible, gross tasting tea. So bad, I threw it away. The taste is a cross between rancid and dirt. Chicago Tea Garden has good oolong tea. The Zealong is a good choice. His private reserve, ""monkey picked"" oolong tea is outstanding. Don't waste your money on this junk."
2,"Note exactly ""Tie Guan Yin""","I received the item on time and the packaging it came in was great! However when I went to steep and taste the tea, to my dismay it was NOT up to the same caliber as other, better quality, Tie Guan Yin. Instead of a strong flavor usually associated with Oolong it was watery and weak tasting even when I over steeped it. It didnt maintain any kind of consistency through out the brewing which was very disappointing. I usually order from a shop in Orlando called Chinese Tea Culture which has AMAZING tasting Tie Guan Yin but went through these guys because of the amount and price.. I guess that's what you get when you buy through Amazon or buy from other places except quality shops."
2,Disappointed after The Skinner & Gridlinked ...,"I had to force myself to finish this one, after having raced through The Skinner & Gridlinked. While the basic plot was good, the execution was flabby. I wish more time was spent with villain Skellor, and a lot less with expendable side-stories of a half-dozen minor characters, which get tedious in this 600 page book (not the 300 Amazon says). The Skinner has a lot of characters too, but they seemed to all be painting important parts of the overall story, on a much more interesting world. The story also lacked of a strong story line with at least one really intriguing character (like Sable Keech in Skinner, or Cormac in Gridlinked). By the end, I just didn't really care that much about any of the characters, and the climax itself seemed tacked on and under-developed. I hope this work is merely a hiccup for Asher."
3,Decent read,"I think Asher's gift as a writer is in imaging a compelling future universe. His world is a network of Polity planets governed by benevolent AIs. The Polity is populated with a range of characters from cyborg soldiers to super cool secret agent types, Separtist rebels, smugglers, New Age scientists and mysterious, super-powerful alien entities.My main problem with ""The Line of Polity"" comes in the shape of a ""deus ex machina"" at the end. I wouldn't have minded this ""rabbit out of a hat"" trick if I didn't feel like Asher had done the same thing in the other novel of his that I read, ""Gridlinked"". My sentiments about it were the same as those here: great universe and interesting characters, lame ending.However, I should point out that my disappointment at the ending of ""The Line of Polity"" was not enough to put me off Asher. I have ""Brass Man"" and am intending to read it soon."
5,Great book on a great engine.,Covers the best American engine of the war. Now if only he'd write one on the Centaurus...
4,Latryx debut and it's hot,"I first of Latryx on the ""Scatch"" DVD when Z-Trip gives his lesson on how to rock a party. The Track he played was ""Lady Don't Tek No"" produced by DJ Shadow. I was like WHAT!!! that's some dope ish. Alls to say that from hearin these guys rip up the mic on Blackalicious' NIA & Blazin Arrow plus that track it's worth it. It's an ep but you get intnstumentals of hot tracks like Lady Don't Tek No and Cloud #9."
5,Beware,"I dont understand this at all.I have always been a big fan of amazon so far.The ad (on amazon) for this discman said it is 99 bucks and now it is being sold at 59 bucks, that is a net saving of 40 bucks.But this is not true sony actually lists this product at 59$.So there is no net savings involved at all.Infact every sony product listed on this page is overpriced and the price slashing is just a farce.Why is this?.To check this out see the prices on sony.com"
3,"Hard to See, Hard to Manipulate","The display is small, the words and symbols are virtually unreadable, and the display is NOT backlit. The buttons and controls are small, difficult to manage, and require an inordinate amount of time to activate.The sound is quite good in MP3 and CD, and battery life is excellent. I took mine back, however, because it was just too hard to see the display--it's WAY too tiny--the smallest font size in a dark display I've ever seen on a new item. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointing Basket,Musty taste on the products. Though looked nice it was musty and had to be thrown out.
5,"Great Gift for Moms, Grandmas, Neighbors, Friends","I have this gift basket and it's well worth the price. A basket like this would cost twice as much at the mall or ordered through a catalog. It contains pancake mix, scone mix, syrup, coffee, strawberry preserves--everything you need to make a family breakfast. And it comes packaged very nicely in a basket that can be reused for holding magazines or as decor. My favorite part of the basket is the hot cocoa tin. It looks old-fashioned and has a picture of people skiing on it. This is a great gift for grandmothers, teachers, neighbors, and anyone who is hard to buy for."
3,equivocado,"equivocado por la sencilla razon de que son muy largos para los manifold de aluminio y supongo que para los de hierro tambien , la cabeza del tornillo es muy pequeña y pareciera que se fuera por el hueco a tapar. otra cosa que ya se estan oxidando y supuestamente eran de cadmio y otro material que no deberian oxidar"
5,This is the Real Deal,"I have heard of Hillsong many times before but dont think I have ever heard a Hillsong performance or song before today. In one day this album has become one of my favorites. Right up there with Michael W Smith ""Worship"". Helps you get your focus on God.Good stuff!"
5,Love it! Love Hillsong United!!,"Anyone young and looking for genuine young praise music should get this. God takes incredibly talented people and makes their talents multiply like crazy. an all of the music is so filled with worship for GOd. a must have, our youth group listens to this stuff all the time now."
5,Worth every penny!,Amazing CD. Worshipping the Lord with Hillsong's United is an awesome time. This CD is probably their best!
5,Emmas Gift,I loved this book. It takes the reader to a time where life is really hard. Makes me grateful to God for the life I have.
5,Leisha Kelly scores again!!,This second book and sequal to Julia's Hope is a great book of reality. It very clearly depicts the hard and sad times our country experienced during the depression. It also shows the strength and courage the people of that era had. Making it possible for them to survive during that bleak period in our history by their faith in God and working together with their neighbors. The times were hard and life had many trials. Mrs. Kelly did a wonderful job of painting a very true and clear picture with her easy flowing words.
3,Emma's Gift,A good old-fashioned story. Real people with good values. This book is part of a series. The characters will be linked into another book in the family series.
3,Emma's gift,This book was well written. It relates a theme of caring people who are willing to help one another. It is full of love and a faith in God.
5,Emma's gift,"This book is such an inspirational and emotional page turner. Just like Julia's Hope, the first book in the series you can't help but cry, laugh and say AMEN!"
2,Pretty good...,"Continuing the story begun in Julia's Hope, Leisha Kelley returns readers to the Depression era Worthham family. Life takes a turn for the worse when days before Christmas, the Wortham's neighbor, Wilametta Hammond, a mother of ten, dies. Julia and Samuel Wortham are suddenly all that stands between her children and certain death as their own father loses the will to live and care for himself, much less the children.Julia finds her great faith severely tested as she tries to care for these other children in addition to her own family. Resources are already tight, and now they are at the breaking point. The flames of love and faith alone warm this ragged group as winter tightens a cold grip of fear around them.** Ms Kelley successfully paints a grim picture of the past, making readers feel her characters emotions poignantly. You get a clear reminder that times may be hard now, but they could be worse. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
4,Perfect compromise,"This little computer replaces my Laptop, my Palm, and my Franklin Planner. It is very light and surpisingly resilient. The wireless features are fabulous. It is a pain to have to plug in the external CDRW/DVD drive I have (it has its own power cord ...), but I use the drive rarely. A USB drive is great for external strage and date transfer. The keyboard is full-size as far as key-size, but condensed - Home, End, and Number Pad are Fn keys. I am astounded by the accuracy with which my written notes are converted to type. I love this thing - and it turns heads!"
4,"History, After the Fact","Davidson and Lytle's book is a study in historiography dealing with the interpretation and analysis of the sources used to report history. The authors concentrate on the several types of sources and the drawbacks of each, specifically biases. Examples include written, oral, video, psycho, cultural, economic and political history. This version includes an investigative CD which enhances the lessons in the book. After the Fact is a good companion to Richard Evans' In Defense of History, David Fischer's Historians' Fallacies, and Mark Gilderhus' History and Historians."
2,Lost for Words,"Louis Jordan, Wyonnie Harris, Louis Prima covers. Jump Blues with dull arrangements. Some songs are good, but nothing special after all."
2,"Fine pillow, horrible massager","I got this as a Christmas present for my husband who loves to take baths, and I thought it would be nice to have something soft to lay on while he's bathing. It is soft, and it does work great if you just want a pillow. But the minute we put the batteries in, it started massaging for about five minutes. Then it stopped. And it hasn't worked since! It seems if you get ANY water in or near the battery encasement it will no longer work as a massager. However, I don't recall it ever being submerged in water, so I would say get it if you want to pay this price for a pillow, but the massager isn't worth it."
1,Waste of money,"Very very little ""massaging"" vibration. Does not sit in tub easily. Very clumsy design. Might as well not spend the money and just get the cheaper bath pillow."
4,Great unknown band,"The 70's were a great time for music when all kind of bands got a shot at the big time. The late 70's gave Trillion a chance for two great lps. I bought the first one on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. This their second offering follows where the first one left off. Not as rockin as the first but better vocals and harmony. If you like Styx, Boston or maybe kansas this should do it for you. Enjoy."
4,Insightful!,"Because this is a dense read, you won't be surprised to learn that the author, Daniel E. O'Leary, is a Ph.D. If you don't have a conversational grasp of acronyms - including, but not limited to ERP, LAN, WAN, SMEs BOPSE, MAPs, SAP and BAAN - then you'll have to decode as you read. If you're actually interested in using the business resource known as ""Enterprise Resource Planning,"" or ERP, your company should be grossing some $200 million a year, because ERP costs about $15 million to implement. While O'Leary makes a very compelling case in favor of ERP, citing integration of information infrastructure, real-time data, value creation and other wonderful attributes, this is a very expensive and risky resource to pursue. Companies such as Microsoft and Cisco had a hard time implementing it and even they have to worry about cost. We [...] warn that this is serious tech for Big Money companies. Mom and Pop operations need not apply."
3,Most issues are shared with usual IS,"The book does not lack interesting subjects, but most of them are not peculiar of ERP systems, and could be suitable for many other kinds of software systems. Gap analysis, costs, human resources and chains are problems people are dealing with since the first computer entered the business word. I would have liked a publication in which briefly summarized process and data issues would be referred to a proper functional, and even technological, architecture of ERP. I do need buy and read a book whose title is ERP in order to get a description of the problems whilst the book is supposed to dissert about their solutions. The latter target has been someway met, but not fully reached."
1,the worst product ever I had,"I bought Avanti portable washer with some expectation.But it turned out to be a nightmare.A supporting bar in the washer was broken after six months.That's bad. That's not the end of story.Since the washer was under warranty, I contacted the customer service several times for repair. However, they just told me that I need to wait until the part comes in. It has been 5 months since I first contacted customer center but I am still told to wait more. This product never should be in market!Worst Product and worst customer service ever I had."
1,Avanti offers No Help.,"This machine was bought at P.C. Richards less than 2 years ago. It worked fine until the agitator broke. Past the warranty time, I called upon Avanti's ""customer Service"" to seek help in any direction. The girl who answered the phone in Miami (800-220-5570) assured me that she could not help in any way except to give me a couple of numbers in my area of washing machine repairers who may or not be able to repair the machine. I said, ""Avanti sells these machines with no back-up help""? She basically agreed. Nice woman but no help. Even if my husband could fix the machine, there is no place to order the parts. We called the local repairers and they said they don't repair ""Foreign machines"".Beware the machine worked great but if it breaks what to do? What a scam.We are out $[...] bucks within 2 years. NO machine. No help. Don't buy it."
5,Troubling tale in Victorian times,"I recently came across this book in a pile of old books and decided to read it. In the introduction the author states that he had read it again in the 60s because his publisher wanted to re-issue it. He said he wondered how on earth he had come up with all of the information about the black arts that he wrote about because he doesn't remember researching it. He thought his style was not at all how he wrote in later years.In any case, I thought it was interesting to read of Paris and London before WWI. I knew trouble was coming as soon as the magician appeared. I was satisfied with the ending.I have the Penguin 1967 paperback edition."
2,Easy read,"While it was an easy read that kept me occupied during a long plane journey, this book pales in comparison to Maugham's other books."
3,Nice introduction to the brand,"I bought this as a gift for someone unfamiliar with the brand. I've been using CM since I worked in a high end men's store during high school and love it. This box has a nice sampling of their products, with most of their lines and scents represented. CM is a classic brand and their products are timeless, no fad gels, or harsh scented colognes. Class through and through."
3,Intersting Labels,This product had some interesting label selections. I have not used the software a lot.
5,A wealth of knowledge,"The Encyclopedia of Louisville is an invaluable resource for those wanting a brief summary of important figures in Louisville's history, structures and events. The amount of research devoted to the thickly bound book is just phenomenal and the width of the knowledge covered is extensive. Much has changed since the year 2000, which is where the book stops on its timeline, and I am hoping that more can be added to this in subsequent publications.If anything, the Encyclopedia is a great launching point to diving into more detailed historical portraits of everything Louisville."
5,Encyclopedia of Kentuckiana,"This one-volume encyclopedia not only covers Jefferson County, but also Bullitt County, Oldham County, Clark County, Floyd County, Harrison County, and Scott County, making it in actuality an Encyclopedia of Kentuckiana. Subjects range from big topics, to the history of various subjects in Louisville (railroads, blacks), to even the mundane (hot browns) and the trivial (when certain famous people visited Louisville). If you want a single resource for object related to the Louisville area, this is the book to obtain."
2,I wasn't nearly as happy with this product ...,"I wasn't nearly as happy with this product as I expected to be. They did cushion my heels and provide good arch support, but they were so bulky that they made my shoes too tight -- even a pair that usually fits loosely. I couldn't get the left one into a comfortable position. There was always a lump under the outside of my foot. I can't say I'd recommend them, but they're pretty inexpensive and maybe others won't find them as uncomfortable as I did. They did provide good arch support."
4,This insole is very easy to wear inside ...,"This insole is very easy to wear inside dress shoes. It's not necessary to do any """"cutting"""" or """"altering"""" of the insole, which is a nice change! Dress shoes can be very tiring and uncomfortable to wear for long periods, especially if you are standing or walking much. These insoles made that time a more enjoyable experience, with less leg and back aches at the end of the day. I would recommend this product to my friends and family."
5,I couldn't wait to get these insoles into ...,"I couldn't wait to get these insoles into my shoes. Because I live in Alaska, and it's sub-zero outside, I was very pleased to see that they didn't have gel in them, because I was afraid they'd freeze on me! I've been wearing them in my work shoes, which are not the most comfortable shoes to begin with. These work like a dream, although I wish they were full-footed insoles, as my toes are jealous! I would highly recommend these to anyone who would like to have the added comfort. A great buy for the money!!"
4,I really liked this product. I am a ...,"I really liked this product. I am a teacher, and on my feet pretty much most of the day. I usually don't wear heels to school so my feet don't hurt as much. Even with my already-comfortable shoes my feet hurt less while using the Dr. Scholl's Insoles Women's Dynastep Inserts, Arch & Heel Support. I will be recommending this product to my friends and family!!!"
4,These insoles are designed to provide support to ...,"These insoles are designed to provide support to your heel. This, in turn, is supposed to lessen pain in your legs and back. After wearing the insoles, I did find that they provided support in the heel part of my shoe. They were comfortable to use."
1,"Original design was cheapened, now leaks","I installed this valve as a replacement for an older Water Master valve (same design, different name). The original valve had two stainless steel reenforcing bands to help retain the top, and it was quite sturdy. It lasted two or three years, but unfortunately the manufacturer has found that he can save a few cents by leaving out the steel bands, so now the retaining screws press directly on the soft plastic of the case. The new valve will not shut off completely, and there is a small but constant flow of water through the sprinkler system, and eventually the ground gets saturated and water puddles around the sprinkler heads. I've never had a problem with Rain Bird valves in 30+ years, and obviously I should have known better than to buy the cheap Orbit stuff that HD was pushing--you get what you pay for. From now on, I'll stick with what I know works."
1,Terrible!!,This valve worked for almost one year before it broke. The Hunter and Rain Bird are four times as old and continue to work flawlessly.
1,Touchy Feely Methods,Another school administrator writing a book about how to teach. No studies or research support any of the methods espoused in this book. It's all opinion based on anecdotal observations. She offers no statistical data to support her methods. I seriously doubted the efficacy of her methods and searched the California Department of Education's web pages to read test scores at the elementary school where she is the principal. Her school's reading test scores have gone consistently South since she's been the principal. I'm not hating on the writer; I'd just like to see curriculum based on research - not opinion.
5,Adds to the room,"I got a pillow from my registry and love it. It just helps make the nursery complete. It is a little pricey, but it is too cute! I don't know anything about this set being discontinued - so far my store still has everything."
2,Brought this out just in time to discontinue the set,"We were in the process of getting the paper dolls set when out of the blue they discontinued the theme, and have since replaced it with an very ugly theme Blossoms, when I called Babies R Us to find out if they were going to discontinue the set (the main company not the store) were very unhelpful that and I could barely make out what the lady was saying I don't know what language this lady was speaking but it wasn't english. They then transfered me to the Amazon.com line and they too couldn't answer my question. So then I called a babiesrus store and finally someone answered my question. They are discontinuing the set, but they just brought out this pillow just as they are about to take it off shelves."
3,SNAFU from the beginning,"I bought this storage cabinet because it would hold all of my media and I would be able to keep my toddler out of the cabinet. Three separate, necessary parts were missing and it took about a month to get them all here and get the unit together. (I had to get the retailer to intervene twice because the manufacturer was so unresponsive.) The unit looks nice, but the locking door doesn't quite line up with the slot for the lock. My two-year-old pulled it open a few days after it was assembled, so we had to get an ugly childproof cabinet lock. Also, we did not put on the decorative pieces at the very bottom of the piece. They serve no purpose and place the full weight of the loaded cabinet on four 1"" wide pieces of scrolled wood instead of the full base plate of the unit. I wouldn't buy it again and I can't send it back now that it's together and the boxes were trashed."
3,A little disappointing,"A little disappointing, not bad but do not put the rails on the bottom because you will have to call to get the bottom replaced - the pegs go right through. The lock looks good but is basically useless, magnets work better. Replacing the door knobs was a must. Somebody else wrote the same things but I had to see it for myself, they were right. Overall, it is nice having all my dvds in the same place but I doubt I would recommend this piece to anyone else, it's probably worth about $200."
5,A geat reference tool for pastors and lay persons who pastor,"Every pastor and every lay person actively involved in the pastoral care of others in the life of the church should have this book on their near shelf for easy reference. It is an excellent resource - I especially enjoyed the variety of articles, some long and some short. Wide ranging topics - from ""psychodrama"" to ""alcoholism"", from ""spiritual direction"" to ""retirement"", it seems that nothing is left out. All articles appear to be well researched from a variety of fields, giving the reader a sense of the deep reliability and relevance of this truly interdisciplinary project. Useful!!!"
1,Thanks but no thanks,"While the insoles were comfortable, I found the results completely unacceptable. After wearing these in my shoes for only 2 hours they dyed my socks black. I'm sure it will come out in the wash, but this is not something I need to deal with on a daily basis. The black (I presume carbon) came straight up through the cloth top of the insole and left the entire sock bottom badly discolored."
2,not good,these rolled and wrinkled up inside my shoes. I got Dr. scholl's odor-x version of these and they are 10x better.
1,horrible,Bought these and put them in my shoes and within minutes they were sliding around in my shoe. Most uncomfortable insert ever. I had to take them out because of the bunching under my feet. Would not ever buy or reccomend.
3,From Back Cover,"Say no to sex. So Jane Langston advises women if they want better relationships. Who knew that as a result men across the country would be sleeping single and blaming her? Now Jane needs a little protection. It arrives in the form of gorgeous Luke Nicoletti, and he has her thinking maybe no isn't the right answer. Instead, she's taking him up on his offer to prove that sex can improve relationships!Luke can't figure out why a woman as sexy as Jane would give such, well, puritan advice. Because when they kiss, they're combustible! Their affair is so steamy, he can't seem to keep his mind on the reason he's there. But as the threats against Jane continue, Luke starts feeling a little more protective of her than his role as her security guy and casual lover warrant. Suddenly he's showing her how their just-for-now affair is hot enough to last forever."
3,"Runny, Poor Coverage","I was picking between the Face & Body and the HD Invisible Cover, and unfortunately went with this one due to its better ratings on MakeUpAlley, despite my already having tried the HD Invisible Cover with pretty awesome results. The foundation appears really runny, and unevenly pigmented. I did try shaking the jar before each use, but that doesn't help much. What's worse is that there is almost no coverage whatsoever. Whatever I put on my face seems to vanish. I don't have a whole lot of blemishes, but I was really hoping to get a more even skin-tone with this foundation. Sadly, I don't get it. I may go in and exchange my Face & Body for an Invisible Cover instead."
4,Love It !! A new must have .,"Make up for ever is my new favorite brand. A little expensive, but well worth it. This foundation is perfect for my oily skin . Its light , and goes on very smooth. It will not provide you full coverage, but for me it works . Its perfect for the hot summer days , because it will not clog your pores, and stays in place without alot of touch ups . I just started using it , so i cant really comment on long term effects, or how it is in other seasons( weather) but so far I LOVE IT ."
1,Makeup,"I don't like this product at all, it does not cover anything and it's very hard to apply, will never buy again."
2,Decent,"The book was in ""okay"" condition. Unfortunately, I was planning to give it as a gift. It's not nice enough to give away. Bummer."
3,Interesting arrangments....,"Well, this CD-G was a bit of a let down. The arrangements don't sound much like the originals they are supposed to be replicating. I play a lot of these songs and do a better job composing myself. Otherwise, it has a lot of really great praise and worship songs, just not very well done."
5,A Must for Fans of The Simpsons or of Grilling!,"I didn't really need a new Weber kettle, as my 10 year + model still grilled fine, but when I saw the Simpsons model I HAD to have it!I must say that Weber has made a great product even better. The new ash catcher is a big improvement, and this model even comes with the hinged cooking grate (for long-cooking turkeys & such).But more importantly, this grill is a beauty. The yellow color is just right, not too bright, and the blue handles are the color of Marge's hair. The graphic with Homer and a skewer of food is well done and is not a decal; it is baked in the enamel. Delivered in a box with a special Simpsons label, this is a must have for Simpsons fans or anyone looking for a quality grill. Good job, Weber!"
5,10th Anniversary Simpsons Weber Grill,"This is the coolest collectors item I have seen and a great gift to give a huge Simpson's fan I bought it for my father for Father's Day and he absolutley loved it, It also adds a little bit more fun to the summers and grilling."
5,Rackman,"Weber grill in use today Many years later. Own a total of 5 weber grils. 2 gas and 3 charcoal at home and at summer cottage. Weber makes the best without a doubt. Grill all year round. Cedar plank with a maple glaze on the chjarcoal grill, use as a main course or as a cover dish to take to a party. OUTSTANDING."
3,What? Teenagers in the Bible? Review,Great book for teens about teens in the Bible. I'm actually using it as a part of a Bible Study series about teens in the Bible with my youth group.
5,Homedics Manicure and Pedicure Style Spa,I would have to spend a lot of money to get regular pedicures for my feet. This item has to be the best money I have ever spent for taking care of my hands and feet. It works efficiently and effectively AND has all of the bits you will need for the easiest and toughest of jobs. I can use this on my kids as well as myself.
2,Really,I just didn't get it.. stupid unrealistic and bitchy.. not my idea of a great show I deleted immediately sad
5,I Have Fallen in Love....,I am playing catch up with this show!! I love BBC comedy and have managed to catch an episode of Ab Fab here and there on cable from time to time but to have access to all the seasons is such a TREAT! Thanks Amazon!
4,I'm very pleased with this Dr. Scholl's heel ...,I'm very pleased with this Dr. Scholl's heel cream. My heels feel and look much better after having used this product.
3,I have a problem with cracked heels and ...,"I have a problem with cracked heels and this cream has worked pretty well. It didn't make the cracks go away, but it did make my heels better. I think that if I used it longer, it'd make more of a difference."
5,A Must for the Divorced Dad's Library,"I recently got this book to improve my relationship with my son who's four years old. I found the book to be easy to read with good and practical tips and information that I found invaluable. It had many things that I started using right away and they helped improve my relationship with my son from the beginning. The author is both a psychologist that councels divorced families along with a divorced dad himself. He offers both on-the-job learned perspectives from the counselor, dad, and child along with his own life experiences. Overall, I feel the book would be a great book to get if you would like to optimize your experiences as a divorced (or seperated) dad."
4,Seems okay,"Seems okay. If addicted already to this animation series. Seems to me the same plots get played over and over. Struggling for a living, going to school, upset with the alien, alien upsetting other alien. Just wish the foreign language sponsor guy had English words going across screen to see what he is saying."
4,Get One of the Newer Ones,Came quickly and in great condition. This game is fun but I recommend Armageddon. It has more characters and smoother fighting. Not bad though. Only necessary if your collecting them all.
2,old xbox system game,game can only be played on old xbox not the xbox 360 system I have. I cannot use it in my system
5,deliverd package,It cam in perffect condition not at a high price but the perfect price for my budget it was perfectly diliverd on thr right time Thank You Adam Diaz
4,It is fun,"I used to have Mortal Kombat when kids were young, played it alot. This one is OK but not quite as good as our old Mortal Kombat."
1,Do we need it?,"Most of these functions come already inInternet Explorer,Netscape, etc, so why does one need it? Can someone specifywhat extra features does this software has?"
5,Not just for War Enthusiasts,"I have to say it. This is my favourite book. Honestly! I recommend it to friends all the time. And I believe it is not just for World War Two buffs, as other reviewers claim. It is very well written - Churchill can write! And the twists and turns - everything decided on the outcome of one event, be it the battle of Britain, or the breaking of Enigma - the book reads like a fantastic fictional account, but it is all true (at least from to Churchill's perspective). I have personally read it 3 times, and will try again for a fourth sometime soon. Or perhaps I will purchase the 6 volume set and see all the details. Still, my advice - read it! A great read, informative, and shows some of the reasons the world is in the state it is today.Dave Montreuil"
4,A mini-series of WWII,"A much more manageable, but perhaps lazy way, of digesting Churchill's six volumes of WWII. Reads more like a mini-series where it is difficult not to push on to the next episode. Of course Churchill's first hand perspective makes it unlike anything else. This reader is more interested in Churchill than the events of the War, but either way it is an interesting read."
4,abridged,"I have not finished this book yet but so far it is very interesting as it reveals behind the scenes info on the prelude and allied conduct of WWII. Personally I don't think I could read the entire set unless I were very, very bored."
5,Must Reading For World War Two Buffs,"Winston Churchill's 'Memoirs of the Second World War,' is one of the most illuminating works on the subject ever written. Churchill tells the story of the war from the massive rearmament of Germany in the thirties to the final victory over the forces of fascism. As a general history of the war it is understandably one-sided, but as a wartime memoir it succeeds on many levels. The feelings of the British Prime Minister on the strategies, soldiers, enemies, and allies of the war are brought to the foreground with an amazing command of language. Churchill justifies many of the more controversial decsions of the war including his stand on British rearmament before the war, the terror bombing of German cities, the 'unconditional surrender' policy of the allies, and the use of the Atomic bomb. This is a finely crafted work that is a tribute to a man who could make history as well as write it."
2,Not as good as Wahl brand,I ordered 5 units for my friend who use it in her salon. She likes the Wahl brand more. HoMedics PC-400 too big and heavy for her small hand. The tools are not very user friend.
4,Professional Clipper Set!,"Great product! You will truly feel like a professional with this 18 piece set. Includes everything you need, from video to shears. Beautifully crafted."
4,Beware of repetition,"Beware of purchasing this book. It is the exact same book as another floral book by The Home Decorating Institute called Creative Floral Arranging. I purchased Decorating with Silk & Dried Flowers not knowing the 2 books are the same. (different titles, same book) That didn't make me a happy camper!"
3,Area 51 Xbox Game,This game OK. It had some very interesting areas and screens to fight through. But the AI for the enemy was not very good. They would attack the same way over and over again.
3,Not Great,"I am a big fan of video games. I own over forty XBox games, most of which are the First Person Shooter type. This game is very good, but you had better take the time to study the book and have the time to play the game, it is not easy by any stretch. I know everyone reading this is saying "" Well, do you really want a game to be easy enough to beat the first day?"". Of course not, but a game should be easy/hard enough to be enjoyable and not nearly impossible"
2,Original is better!!!,"I have played the demo but not the real game and it stinks!Worse than original(the original OWNS!!)Guns are definitly ripped off from halo 2and did I mention the original owns? Nothing can beat the original Area 51 (by the way, you can buy the original for ps1)!!"
5,Classic Area 51 fans rejoice,"This game immediately gives the great feeling of the classic shooter game. The story presentation gives more detail in to the conspirator's world and guides the player in to a situation where blasting everything in sight is not only fun, it's imperative to your survival.There are 4 movie scenes that unlock as the game progresses, not including the standard cinematics guiding the game. These are among the best, if not the best, graphics of any Xbox game to date.GUNS! This game has some very sweet guns and artillery. Including some alien technology, one of their guns allows a laser sight to peek around corners, giving access to bank shots! This one should make for some great multiplayer fun.Overall, this game is easy to review. If you like the classic Area 51 for arcade, get this and get ready to flash back in time!"
1,"High on illustrations, low on math... and very small print","As another of the reviewers remarked, this book was obviously originally designed to be a ""coffee-table"" book on math for casual browsing... lots of beautiful illustrations (ranging from Michaelangelo pictures employing the use of perspective, right through to computer-generated fractal patterns), a chatty but superficial perusal through the history of mathematics, and very little in the way of actual mathematics content.Unfortunately it seems the publisher slashed the printing budget for this book, and instead of being published in its originally designed ""coffee-table book"" dimensions, the book has been reduced in physical size with the result that the text is pretty small, and the print on the pages looks very cramped."
4,Does the Job,I am satisfied with the product. Easy to inflate and deflate. Does the job for a good price. Though it feels like it deflates a bit through the night.
1,Coleman Comfort Smart Airbed,"My wife and I bought this airbed for visiting guests. We tried it ourselves for one night and were quite disappointed in the bed, because it was very stiff, it did not provide any support, and we both woke up with sore necks. We have decided to return it and go for an Aerobed instead."
3,Nice but it could hold air better,"Within 8 hours of sleeping, the brand-new bed was deflated by 10%-20% - a very noticeable amount. I don't think it has a manufacturing defect. I think the seal just isn't very good.Also, even with fresh batteries, the battery-pump can't make the bed super-firm. I would advice getting an extra plug-in pump for use when you're at home because the battery-pump just isn't strong enough.Other than that, it's a comfortable bed, and it stores easily and nicely in the built in bag."
4,Comfy,"Brought this replace the camping pads for the wife and kids. Used on our last car camping trip. Worked like a dream, easy to inflate and easy to put away. Good price, free shipping, no tax, who could ask for anything more? My only beef would be that the built in carrier for the mattress does not have a spot for the inflator, so you gotta remember to bring and pack both separately."
4,big and comfy,"I've only tested this mattress for a few days, and I'm mostly happy with it. The battery operated air pump makes it easy to fill, and it deflates VERY quickly. My only concern is that it did seem to lose a little air over night... not much, but I did end up refilling it a bit at bedtime each day. But it's soft and comfortable and I was very grateful to have it. The packing directions and attached ""bag"" are helpful too... clear, simple, and easy to use. All in all, a good purchase!"
5,Gifts for Backpackers,"Bride to be says these will make a wonderful addition to their camping experience. They are advid campers and had wanted these items, so I imagine they will make great use out of them and Coleman makes great products, that's all I used when I used to camp."
4,Good choice,"This queen size mattress works just fine...nothing fancy, but as comfortable as a blowup mattress can be! Will plan to put on an old mattress pad I have and that should make it perfect!"
5,air mattress,"great price, works great even after a year and half. blows up quick with air battery blower. holds air very well"
5,does what it says it does,Great buy family members used this for three weeks and it worked beautifully. No leaks and only a couple of air top ups. Reccomended buy and worth the extra for the additional depth.
5,We camped for six weeks on this mattress---and loved it,"My husband and I just took this mattress on a six-week car-camping trip across New England and Atlantic Canada. It was so comfortable. We only used one set of size D batteries (which surprised me since we blew it up and took it down usually every two days.) We had to add a little air to it every night, but that's easy. Great mattress. Durable. Can't say enough good things about it."
3,Works in a pinch,"This is a nice, inexpensive solution when you have excess guests and need an extra bed. The pump isn't quite strong enough to inflate it so that the mattress is firm, and it requires 4 D batteries (sold separately). As is, with two adults on the somewhat under-inflated mattress, it can be a little wobbly if you get too close to the edge. The 4D pump does a nice job of deflating it when it's time to put it away. Rolls up nicely into an attached case with ties for storage.3 stars because of comfort & pump strength. I would imagine that the plug-in version of the pump might have the power to inflate the mattress better."
1,Very Disappointed (Does not hold air),"Received the bed, inflated it according to the directions, after a couple hours of sleeping on the bed it was 80% deflated. Day 2, inflated the bed again according to the directions and the bed deflated again. The double valve system and claims the it will not leak were not true in my case.Maybe they need to work on quality control. Not what I expected form a brand like Coleman.Positive note, the battery operated pump worked great and the bed inflated very quickly."
3,Set's up quick,"For the price this is a decent mattress. The pump works great and is fast- minutes.The flocked covering makes it nice so the sheets don't slide off and it is quiet. I think the air chambers make it more supportive than other air mattresses. It did not leak. But it still is an air mattress, it's more comfortable for one. When two people are on it feels like the sides are pushing up, maybe it would be better with less air in it. Also with all air beds if you toss and turn the bed bounces, can't get around that.Overall it was good"
4,"Nice, comfortable BUT...STINKY!!!... : (","SO i went ahead and bought this mattress, price was right and brand is known. Package arrived very quick and it was packed nicely.PROS: It looks really nice, soft to the touch and looks very durable, pump is a little cheap but serves its purpose, the inflation process is pretty quick and the air secure valve on the mattress works well. It stayed inflated for more than 48 hrs in despite of 2 people sleeping on it for 2 nights, no additional air had to be pumped. VERY comfortable for the back.CONS: EXTREMELY stinky!!! the smell of plastic and chemicals is kinda annoying, even my pillow catch the smell, there was a review here that said the same and i just didnt pay enough attention so if you are sensitive to strong smells..read that review too.Overall, if you are going to use it for very occasional times, its fine and works well, the wrap and roll feature makes is easy to store, hopefully the smell will go away."
1,Very disappointed,"I have had nothing but trouble with this bed. The air pump failed to work from the start and the bed does not stay inflated overnight. It slowly gets deflated, even if no one is sleeping on it. I purchased it brand new, not used. Must just be a lemon!"
1,you get what you pay for,"What a disappointment. I sent this bed to my daughter's house so that I would have something to sleep on when I visit. It is very thin and the pump is flimsy. The mattress does not pump up fully, I cannot determine if that is because of the pump or the mattress. During the night, unless you are a slight, skinny person, if you turn over you will find that parts of your body touch the floor. This definitely would not be comfortable for two people. Also, getting up in the morning is difficult because you are so close to the floor. A young person may have no trouble but anyone over 40 will find it to be a challenge unless you are an olympic gymnast. I used this for three nights and saved the price of a hotel room. In that respect I got my money's worth but I will not use it again.Spend a little more money and get a thicker mattress."
1,Already has tears in seam after 1 month,"2 splits in seams after a month and tried taping it but there must be a leak somewhere else. I called the warranty dept and the woman said that it is only meant for camping and occasional use, not daily use. She said it must be deflated daily and then re-pumped. Really??? Why wasnt that information in the box when purchased? She said it is made of vinyl and it is normal for there to be splits in seams if used frequently. In other words, this product is a cheap POS and shouldnt be used more than a few times because it is normal for it to get tears in the seams. Then she said the guarantee is only for the valve not leaking. NOT for the cheap seams. DO NOT buy this product it is crap."
2,Only lasted 1 camping season.,"I purchased this mattress during the summer of 2008. Very portable. Easily roles up into a small package. Comes with a handy battery operated pump (which has lasted all year on the original 4 D batteries that I put in). I love the way it deflates the bed. Gets all the air out in about 2 minutes.The problem with the bed is that it has a hard time keeping its shape. The pump will blow it up so that it appears to be inflated, however, it will need about 15 to 20 additional blows with your lungs in order to bring it to an acceptable density (I like it a little softer). Once you lay on the bed for more than 1 hr you notice that it starts to deflate a bit. The first 5 times I used it only lost 10% to 15% of its air after sleeping on it for 8 hrs. During my most recent camping trip it lost 100% of its air within 2 hrs.I guess you get what you pay for. At least I got a nice little pump out of it and about 5 uses out of the mattress for under $30."
2,OK nothing more nothing less,"Its ok not much more, used the items twice and already it has a small hole to be patched. Forget about the battery pump, you will need to buy the electric pump if you don't want to wait 30 mins + for it to fill up."
1,American common sense and ingenuity eliminated - made by Chinese for short Chinese people,"Coleman (and so many other US companies) has lost their common sense and allowed their products to become impractical (and primarily for light duty use) by focusing on how cheaply can they obtain their products. The height of American men averages 6'. I am 6'2"" tall. All air mattresses that are available are 75"" long, which means if you are 6' tall or more and you use a pillow, your feet will not be supported well and have to hang over the end. When air mattresses were 79"" long, they were acceptable. The brand ""Coleman"" does not necessarily mean ""quality""; it probably just means better than the other low quality, cheap products."
3,Good for an over-nighter,"This is a good mattress for an over-nighter at someone's house or a 1-2 day camping excursion, but that's it. If you plan on using it for a longer period than that, you may experience back pain. With two adults, you'll definitely loose air; kids might fair better. I also own the double high version of this matress -- and I highly recommend that version instead. It's a little bit more money, but I sleep better on that than my Cal King at home. From an economic stand point this queen-sized quickbed is a good deal, but spend the extra $30-$40 if you've got it for a much better night sleep."
4,Nice bed for the price,Relatively comfortable. Stayed inflated 3 nights in a row. Easy set up and take down.
4,Good option for the price,"Considering the price, this is a decent option. I didn't like the pump, which comes with no batteries, and you have to go and buy those the first thing after you get the bed. I'd much prefer a good hand pump and no such fuss."
1,buyer beware,Coleman does not stand behind this product. Got this as a gift and used it three times. Started to leak and called for warrenty. They said since I don't have a receipt I can't collect on the one year warrenty. I understood that. However the warrenty starts when the product is manufactured not when purchased. So be aware.
1,Very Cold and Uncomfortable,"Fast inflator. It states for indoor/outdoor use, but it was very cold to sleep on. We even used insulation. We would have been warmer on the ground. And we got the queen so we both could sleep, but if one person moves or rolls over, it almost bounces the other one off. We tried different levels of inflation and insulating the mattress, but it was just not a good fit for outdoor camping."
2,Deflates too quickly,"I've had 3 Coleman air beds. They've all leaked so quickly, I would assume there was a hole and bought new ones. I fill it at night for 1-2 guests, and then by morning, they're pretty much sleeping on the floor. The fabric is fine and it inflates at a good time. The bed is too big to fold into the black ""bag"" completely (like the way it comes when you first buy it). Overall, I'm pretty disappointed because it doesn't keep air."
4,Good buy for the money,This inflatable bed suited our needs very well. We were flying to visit family who did not have enough beds. We had this bed shipped direct to their location.The cost was very reasonable and was easier than carrying the bed as luggage. Set up was easy though the instructions were not well detailed. My two kids slept on it for a week and said it was comfy but cold. A blanket layered under the bottom sheet solved this problem. The bed held its inflation for the week despite two kids flopping down on it. It rolls up and has self ties so we could easily carry it back on the plane.
4,superior comfort. easy storage. not such a great pump,"I purchased the queen sized model and it has been excellent for both my wife and I. The quick roll-up feature is great for packing and storing away. You will notice little difference in comfort from a good mattress to this inflatable version. As with all air mattresses, they will eventually leak, but mine lasted for over a year. ((It could be more due to the fact that mine is resting on a very rough sisal rug every night than the strength of the mattress.))I have no complaints other then spending tons of money on 4-d batteries to run the pump. The batteries will begin to wear down after about 7-10 inflations and then inflation takes FOREVER and you will not get the mattress fully pumped up. Otherwise, inflation goes VERY quickly, and you get a very nice, firm inflation within about 3 mins. I will buy the electric pump next time. I think that may be more economical."
4,"NOT THERE YET, BUT CLOSE","Eric can certainly play and the touring with ROBIN TROWER has obviously helped in his developement, but at this stage he is still searching for his own style. His guitar sound and phrasing borrow from TROWER on more than one occasion, but no one else has been able to emulate TROWERS styling or tone and expand on it. ERIC is certainly doing that. His voice is not always comfortable and sounds forced at times. The lyrics rarely reach great hights but are adequate. Saying all that, this is still a very good blues CD and grows on you after every listen. I will buy some more of his CD's and will keep an eye on future releases. A superb blues album from Eric would not surprise. Other cd's in this vain ( as good or better ): COLIN JAMES - DAVID GOGO - VINCE CONVERSE - MARK MAY - MARK SELBY - SCOTT HOLT - ERIC GALES"
5,Finally,"My biggest complaint about Smallville, the TV series, has been the ridiculously low amount of on-screen time for supposed best friends, Clark Kent and Lex Luthor.Fortunately, the TV tie-in novel, CITY, rectifies that lack - showing us, finally, the friendship between the boys, instead of just telling us about it. I normally avoid tie-in books, but I can't recommend CITY highly enough - if you like Smallville and if you got hooked on the show because you wanted to see what Clark and Lex were like as friends *before* they grew up and became enemies, buy this book. You won't regret it."
5,interesting story,"for once an author has decided to show more of the character of lex luthor. lex has to go into metropolis for a few days and asks clark to come along. after some arguement his parents consent.(the only part of the book i really could not see them doing.) as lex tries to show clark a good time, they get involved in a bunch of trouble from japaneese mafia to secret agent who thinks he has found an alien in the mix. how that turns out is worth reading the book by itself. the author gives good insight into the characters of our 2 heroes and adds a few thoughts on the character of lex. it is a beautifully written book and definilty worth the money for smallville fans."
3,Not what we expected,"This book was a surprise to us. We had expected a book about learning shapes aimed at young children, such as kindergartners. This story follows the author as a young boy and his family through the Tate Gallery in London. Anthony begins to gain a sense of art appreciation from his mother even though his father has a lame sense of humor and does not seem overly interested in the gallery. The illustrations were quite detailed and engaging. They make the reader wish to revisit them multiple times. The message of ""The Shape Game"" becomes evident at the end when Anthony's mtoher teaches him a game that she used to play with her father, and it then becomes a lifelong interest for him."
4,lebt dr alte Holzmichl noch,Happy carnival type song and music Even more fun if you understand GermanRealy enjoy listening to this wonderfull cd
3,Great video,"Seth rules, but it could've had more. But..... Gotta get the video just because it's all of the coolest jumps from the other videos all in one. If you collect the Crusty's, you'll get to see all the jumps you said ""SON OF A!!!!"" to, all in one. The one downfall is that.. if you collect Crusty's, you've seen most of it already...... but not in a row!!!"
5,A biography on ''The Famos dare devil'' Seth Enslow,If you are a dirt biker its a most see.From when he started to when he was simply amazing.See him jump his death difiing 249 foot jump witch leaves him with 50 stapls in his head.I strongly recomend this dirt biking biography.
1,Seth - The Hard Way - Save Your Money,"Seth - The Hard Way. (The hard way to what?)Why did I only give this DVD a One Star? - Because there is No Zero Star.I have a small collection of Freestyle Motocross DVDs and this one I got rid of.As someone said to Seth - he has ""issues to work out"".It shows him trying some crazy - long distance jump - the bike breaks in two.He like splits his head too - and requires like life saving surgery.I guess he is proud of this?? This is where I don't see any point to watching him.I like Pastrana - he is amazing. He has spectacular jumps and crashes - but Seth Enslow just seems to be a cross between a semi-talented free-styler and Johnny Knoxsville on a a death wish - and I guess he wants us to cheer him on??I think it's just tragic - and I hope he does get some help.Either way - there are better DVDs out there.Scott MacNeil Feb 8, 2011"
5,Perfect for Enya lovers,Those who love Enya will love this product. Those looking for something trendy won't be interested. I loved it.
3,Disc information is wrong,"The DVD was advertised as NTSC region 2, and I received a PAL region 0 (free) DVD. I've read another review saying that the DVD was NTSC region 1, and I thought that the information shown on the product page was wrong, and the DVD was really an NTSC region 1 disc. I got confused and bought it thinking that I would receive the NTSC region 1 DVD, but I've received the other one. Now the only way I can play it is using my computer since my DVD player can't play PAL discs. Thats not a problem for me, but it's kinda annoying watching it on the PC.As for the DVD itself, it's just awesome, If you are a fan o Enya, this DVD is a must have in your collection."
4,Good but damaged,"I had the same problem with this DVD as another reviewer. The DVD plays fine but the last two bonus tracks do not. The two extras for: The making of.... don't play at all. I bought this DVD new and sealed but it just does not play the bonuses. The main video with ENYA hits is perfect and delightful. Especially, the title: Evening falls, that is filmed in black & white is just phantastic."
3,NTSC Region 1 DVD,"Not the PAL region 2 DVD as advertised. Plays ok, except last two items of the 3 extra features."
2,"Damaged CD,making a cross country journey","I ordered this item with CD to help me with pronuncition,but unfortunately the CD was broken,perhaps the book was sent from Los Angeles (where it was supposed to be delieved to)to different places in north east of the country and finally back to Los Angeles,with a broken CD.which is of no help to me."
1,CD Required all the time and slow to start.,CD required in the drive all the time and slow to start.
1,Don't waste your money...,"This ""guide"" is little more than a fold-out pamplet with very small print. The information is nothing special and probably the same stuff you could learn from wikipedia travel or other sites. There is little ""luxe"" about the information and even for $9 and the 4-for-3 deal it is not at all worth the money."
4,At last academia is acknowledging a masterpiece!,"This slim volume is authored in the cool, precise, meditative voice of academia. Den Uyl places Rand's novel in its literary, cultural, and philosophic context. He makes an interesting case for Dominique actually being the character most readers have the most in common with, and so, relate to the best. But most important, Den Uyl concludes his work by acknowledging that The Fountainhead is actually the mythical ""Great American Novel"" that so many literary types are always moaning for. Well, here it is, live and in-person, Den Uyl says, calling it the perfect novel about what is most essential to America: individualism. Nice to see an academic Ahab finally harpoon the ""Great American Novel!"""
4,A measured and very insightful treatment,"Den Uyl has produced a unique treatment of this controversial book by its controversial, iconoclastic author. It is measured, analytical, showing a low-key but unobtrusive passion for his subject. The novelties of the analysis are wonderfully developed and will surprise many. Finally, no one will be able credibly to just dismiss Rand's writing any longer -- Den Uyl has identified The Fountainhead's merits without fawning or worship, based simply on the work's literary attributes."
4,RCA the way to go,"I have now been involved with RCA for several years and it's the way to go in the future. This book is a good example of what Root Cause Analysis is all about. The book focuses on the use of the PROACT system and I imagine would they would work very well together. I am looking at trying PROACT as well, not just yet! Good book easy to read and gives good definitions to those foggy terms. I enjoyed the book and I use it for my job which speaks for it's self, it doesn't hide in a cupboard or on a shelf. I get the feeling this book is one of the better ones in the bunch, not just someone who has jumped on the RCA bandwagon because it's a flavour of the month."
4,Dr. Scholl's is the expert in over-the-counter foot ...,"Dr. Scholl's is the expert in over-the-counter foot care and these Odor Destroying Insoles live up to the name. I wore these for a little over a week and not only did they help combat foot odor, but they were also very comfortable to wear. I definitely recommend these to anyone interested in improving their foot care regime."
2,Meh.,"These bunch up in the toes and become very uncomfortable to use if you actually walk around in them. I suppose they'd be fine for someone who just sits in their swivel chair all day.As far as 'eating odor' I guess they are better than nothing. I wear either tights or nylons in my leather shoes and am on my feet all day long at work. My feet still stink at the end of the day, but not as bad as they did before using these."
1,This series is NOT RECOMMENDED.,"I have been teaching ESL for ten years. This series is always suggested due to budget constraints. This book claims to be picture-based, but the pictures hardly make any visual sense. I would even call them laughable. (I have laughed at them! They made good dinner conversation for my family. ""What could that be??"") Many pictures are very difficult to understand visually, making it difficult to explain the idea/action being depicted. I find myself having to bring in other pictures/photos to compensate for the poor quality of this ""picture-based"" book. I generally use outside materials in teaching, but I am forced to do so with this book. I find myself cursing this book every time I have to use it."
3,God Teach support!!,This book help you to going in the englsih world in fun works!! You can know new samples and ways to talk an think in english..really fgod
4,"if you love early Basie, get this","pretty good sound considering, and some fascinating solo work. The gems are two versions of Lady Be Good with solos not only by Lester Young, but also Herschel Evans (who did not solo on the recorded version)."
5,edge of you seat action!,"If you like suspense, drama and lots of action that will leave you on the edge of your seat from the bigging to the end then you've got to check out this new movie from Cloud Ten Pictures! Left Behind the movie is based on the first book in the popular ""Left Behind"" series. It features Kirk Cameron (from Growing Pains) who plays a reporter named ""Buck"" who trys to get the scoop on some mysterious dissappearances. Where did everyone go? And could his own life be in jeperody? Join ""Buck"" and the rest of the cast as they discover what it means to be ""Left Behind"". The acting is well done, although I wish there was more time to develope the characters. Over all, I think this is an excellent movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Whether your a Christian or not if you like action packed entertainment then this movie is for you!"
4,from a Christian actor's point of view,"Watching the technical side of the movie makes it a great film. It is the best film in the Christian genre. No, it doesn't hold to a multi-million dollar Hollywood film; but for what it is, a small budget independent film, it is terrific. All the core actors are terrific. Bravo to Kirk Cameron for shedding all the pre-conceived notions I had of him (Mike Seaver, Growing Pains) and playing a character so far from what the nation has seen of him before. Also watch for Janaya Stephens, as Chloe Steel, she is definately going to be on the ""up-and-coming"" list. She is a very talented actress (and cute too). To grade it correctly I have to look at it from two perspectives: -As a Christian film I give it 5 stars. -As a soon-to-be released film: 3.5 stars. But it is a must see for all audiences, young or old, Christian or not, a fan of the book or not. It is ENTERTAINING which is what most films of it's genre forget to do."
1,Being Christian is no excuse for a shoddy moviemaking,Lets remember that low budget films are not by definition bad - some are superb. It depends on the makers.The film starts out as occasionally interesting - if something of a straight steal from King's The Langoliers at times. But continues beyond reality.The reaction to the missing is simply not credible - and an viewpoint that happily sits the antichrist at the UN confirming the views of extremists is simply distasteful and rather scary in a world where some remember that there are fanatics in every religion.As a film is fails miserably. Nothing to do with funding - everything to do with the creative input.As a story? Deeply disturbing to consider this is how some express a sincere faith in their god.
4,Very good prediction,"Of all three of the Left Behind movies, this first one is the best. It really hit me home how the return of Christ could affect the world and country and individuals.Kirk Cameron was really good in this (although I love him in Fireproof better) and I am very happy they made this film."
4,Good movie in itself,"I read the book first and found out there was a movie and watched it that day. The movie is a good movie in itself. It does not follow the book exactly so I had to watch it twice to get over the parts where I was saying ""that is not what happened in the book"". As far as ""preaching"" in the movie there was little to none, which the books have quite a bit of. People in my family who watched it without reading the book first had to ask a few questions, but found it interesting and are now going to read the book. Kirk Cameron is the perfect ""Buck""!!!"
2,THE BOOK WAS BETTER,"Because the books to this series are so great it leads you to have high expectations of the movie. This movie fell short of those expectations because of its low budget and mediorce acting. I believe the books message (in the form of a movie) would have been spread farther had the movie been produced by a bigger company. I was sorely disappointed by the movie and have hence, lost interest in the remainding novels. I have read maybe the first 5. In essence, the books are usually better than the movie anyway but I think that because of the popularity of the series this could have been as good as Lord of the Rings had it been produced differently."
2,Very Disappointing,"Like a lot of others I was very disappointed. I'm on book 8 at the mo' and my wife is rabbidly awaiting book 10(!) We got the DVD on noticing it in the local Christian book-shop. No arguments, we just bought it as we loved the books. It's a good film, not badly acted - bit dodgy on the special effects, but . . . Well right from the off you notice the differences. Buck is a TV journalist, most of the action takes place in the US, with no proper European/UK scenes. Chloe's story-line is all wrong etc etc . . . Things happen in the book as they don't happen in the film. I think it was the director who said - in the extras - that they felt the weight of expectation due to the fact that so many had read the book/series. Maybe so, but it didn't stop him or the writers & producers producing a sadly lacking movie with little or no relevance to the book, except maybe in the character names. I'm not gonna buy the Trib Force movie, as I can only imagine what they've done to that one(!)"
3,Wish there was ALOT more to the movie!,"The movie just like the book starts out with you on the edge of your seat, but it quickly loses steam. Although they try very hard, unfortunately, a 90 minute movie can not do justice to the book. The book was insightful and inspirational, but the movie struggled very hard to keep with the plot and story line of the book. Having seen the movie trailer on television prior to beginning the book series, I definitely had a preconceived image in my head of the characters. Kirk Cameron as Buck, Chelsea Noble as Hattie, Clarence Gilyard as Pastor Barnes, Brad Johnson as Rayford, Gordon Currie as Nicolae, and Colin Fox as Chaim Rosensweig were great, only Janaya Stephens as Chloe left something to be desired, mostly I think because she just didn't fit the part. The movie certainly did not capture the essence of the book which left you anticipating the sequel."
1,Mike Seaver Lives!!,"This movie was a terrible disservice to the book and almost unwatchable. It took me 3 tries to get through it. A waste of the talents of Brad Johnson and Clarence Gilyard, it was instead used as a vehicle for Mike Seaver, I mean Kirk Cameron and his wife (who's actually a better actor than he is) to get work. A very poorly developed story line, which bore virtually no resemblance to the book. Kirk Cameron is such a poor actor, his mannerisms are almost laughable. However, my wife still liked him (She probably still has her Tiger Beat mags from '85). Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Read the book which was much better."
1,Bibically Unsound,"This movie expresses a doctrine that has been pervading our society for a long time. The doctrine of ""The Rapture"" is not biblical. The view is derived from a few passages of scripture in Matthew which indicate people being left behind. These passages are not taken in the context of the WHOLE, thus creating confussion. Aside from the biblical inperfections, the movie is just not good. It lacks the attention grabing story line that makes a good movie."
4,Awesome Message!,This is a must see for all Christians. It re-affirms the belief of the rapture and expectations of the end times. We've watched it twice already.The only thing we did not like was that the voices didn't match the lips in several parts of the movie. Otherwise a great movie. Can't wait to watch Left Behind II now.Jeff
3,Disappointed.,"I loved the cast, but so much of the ""meat"" of the story was ""left behind"" in the book. There was not enough time spent on character developement which is so essential to the story. While reading the books, I did not want to finish one unless I had the next one there to start on. I do not get that feeling with the movie. I mean if the Sci-Fi channel can do a 20 hour mini-series on aliens, surely there is someone out there who could do justice to the Left Behind series."
2,Not what I expected,The movie version of this book was not what I expected. The book went into so many details that I just knew the movie would bring all of it out and it didn't. I expected the movie to convince someone who doesn't like to read books to pick up this book and continue through the series. I was disappointed.
3,"good movie, awesome book","this movie definately left something to be desired after having read the book, but it is still a good movie. while the people and places are the same, the sequence of action differs from the book, and several things happen in the movie that did not happen in the book. the good thing is that you can see the movie and understand it without reading the book, though the book is more detailed. i would advise either reading the book or listening to the book on tape before watching this movie."
1,Worst Movie I have ever seen,"Try as I could, I could not believe this was even put on DVD. I bought it for $6 and wanted my money back. I felt cheated. I was embarrased to even have it on my DVD shelf.If it had been written and produced by a high school class then it would have made more sense but a professional team?Forget about it.I saw other reviewers felt the same but could not believe my eyes when I saw that someone felt it was great. It is an embarrasement. Save your money and more important save your time and skip this movie."
5,Warning! Don't be left behind!!,"The movie Left Behind is based on the phenominal novel series Left Behind. The movie and books are based on the end times as told in the Book of Revelation.The possibility of the end times happening as portrayed in the movie and books are so close to scripture that it takes your breath away.It's comforting to know that Christian actors such as Kirk Cameron are able to impact Hollywood with Christian movies like this one.It's action packed at every turn and leaves you wanting more. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel.If you're a believer, you leave the movie with an urgency to tell the world about the end times and the saving grace of Jesus. If you're a non-believer, you may just become one. For non-believers this movie will catch your interest in a non-threatening way. I recommend that you see it just because it's good drama and action. Who knows, you might just become a beliver and not be Left Behind! Movie release in theatres--Feb. 2, 2001"
5,Do not be left out--you must see Left behind-The Movie,This movie is awesome. I have never seen a movie that brought a message as clear as this one. The actors in this movie really inspire. If you are a believer you will want your nonbeliever friends to view this movie. Left Behind the movie is very close to the book. The entire series is inspiring and I can only pray that more of the series will be made into movies. May the Lord bless you and keep you. In His name.
5,No dejes de ver Dejados Atrás por nada del mundo!!!,"La Película Dejados Atrás es sumamente impactante por el mensaje profético que divulga, la calidad de la cinta, sonido, representación de los personajes muy excelente. No tiene nada que envidiarle a cualquier película de acción y/o drama. Lo mejor de todo es la conciencia que crea de todavía hay oportunidad de no quedarte atrás..."
4,Left Behind,"I enjoyed the plot of the movie. I had already read the book(the whole series, in fact), and I found it stayed pretty close to the original story-line. Kirk Cameron did a great job as Buck. He was an excellent choice for the part. This makes me wait with impatient anticipation for the next movies in the series.My only criticism doesn't really have to do with the plot, but rather the fact that there were no subtitles. That was very very disappointing. Other than that, I was very pleased with the movie."
3,it is okay,"If you have read the books you will be a little let down by the plot of this movie. It tends to compress the events of the first half of book 1 into a two to three day time span. The major downfall from a christian stand point is the ""your right I am saved now"" realization of all the characters happening 5 minutes after they hear the message. As a stand alone movie it works, but as a based on the novel it fails. The special effects were good for a made for tv movie, but this movie is going to hit theaters in febuary. The acting was suprisingly good, the actors did well with a very weak script and cheesy cliches. Over all this movie is made for christians and unlike the book not to get people interested in Christ."
2,Not As Good as I thought it was going to be,"I saw this movie and I honestly was disappointed at the differences between it and the book. I was even more disappointed when the authors were not even credited, nor were they involved in writing the screenplay, something I think would have been in the best interest of the producers. It is my hope that the producers will recognize that the authors need to have some input, because there are fans of the series that will be disappointed should this continue. I also hope that the producers will take the risk and involve the entire book in the next movie: Tribulation Force. The movie mostly ploded along in my opinion, there was nothing in it that truly grabbed my attention, it was something that I just watched, there was nothing in it that grabbed me and made me think at all. I hope the next one will be treated with the respect this series deserves."
5,Left Behind,I will say like I did about Left Behind II. I enjoyed this movie and if you want an awaking moment just get this movie.
3,Not bad for such a low budget.,"I treasure the Left Behind series and was so excited to see the movie. Yes, it was a bit dissapointing in some places, but when you look at the size of the production company and compare that to Lucas or someone big, there's no way they could afford to be Star Wars like. The message is still there - better be ready for when Jesus comes back! It isn't going to be pretty for those Left Behind!"
1,Premillenialism is COMPLETELY anti-biblical.,"I can't understand why people buy into the premillenial garbage? Anyone with an eigth of a brain who can do even remotely intelligent exegesis will be able to tell (if they actually read the Bible) that every time Christ talks about the rapture, it is AFTER the tribulation. AFTER!!!"
4,A movie too powerful for liberals.,"While still with my ex girlfriend. i suggested this movie.She immediately told me why she did not want her 13 year old daughter to see this powerful movie.The acting in this movie is phenominal. It is a great movie for the whole family and uses bible phophecy integrated into the current state of affairs in the world.My liberal ACLU/ Unitarian friends hated it. That is reason enough too see it. I am not a very religious person , this movie puts the world into perspective and we see how our current leaders have sold out Judeo Chritianity in exchange for power and greed.The end of the movie will leave you thinking."
1,"I read the book, and I'm a beliver....and this movie was bad","The book was good, so I thought how cool it would be to make a movie out of it. I'm not a film maker so I'm not going to nit pick, but I am very disapointed that this company wasted what was a great idea. Had this moive held its own it had a chance to make lots of money in the theater. But after ""Left Behind"" opens in the theater, and it should have an ok opening weekend, that should be last we will ever hear of this highly undeveloped, waste of time."
2,Doesn't do justice to the book,"I was very excited when i bought this dvd, for I enjoyed the book so much. I had just finished the book yesterday, and I even wrote an in-class essay on the significance of the title to the book. Every detail of the book was and still is fresh in my mind.If you want a plot summary of the book or movie, which indeed are slightly different, check out another person's review. Yet I'm going to tell you how I thought the movie hadn't done the book justice.- Compressing the 468 pg. novel into a 95 minute movie chopps off MUCH of the story line off- Characters met under different circumstances that detracted from the experience- Rayford Steele's acting was subpar- Plot was insanely wrong- Buck a tv reporter? enough saidpros- a nice watch if you can't get enough of Left BehindIn conclusion, only watch this movie AFTER you've read the book. Yet, still worth watching...I guess."
4,don't be LEFT BEHIND...,Left Behind: the Movie illustrates how it is truly possible for the events in the Book of Revelation to begin unfolding NOW. A must-see for all!
4,Will you be left behind?,"For those who have read the books, this film will seem too short and you will know the scenes that are missing. If you haven't read the books, you will not know that anything else belongs in the movie. It is sometimes slower-paced that you might want, but overall it grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the film. The special effects are not as dramatic as other high-budget films, i.e. James Bond, etc., but they are to be computer-enhanced before the film is released to the theaters on February 2nd, 2001. Not everyone identifies the ""bad guy"" quickly, but that just adds to the film's suspense. I enjoyed the movie a great deal and expect to watch it again in the theaters. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes thought-provoking drama; you wouldn't want to be left behind."
5,Awesome Spiritual Blast!,This movie was awesome! It stayed true to the book as close as any movie can. (Lets face it the book is always better) It is a powerful spirtual messege to all; Christians and Non-Christians alike. The movie will touch the heart of all. They joy to know that there is a greater love; and a greater peace.
5,A Must Watch,Left Behind the series is the most awe inspiring series I have had the privelage of reading. When the movie came out I had to watch it. It is just a wonderful as the books. The message is so important that everyone needs to hear it. Please watch the video and tell everyone you know that they need to watch it and read the series. Then tell them that they need to find a church if they do not already have one. This is a must see movie and a must hear message.
5,Left Behind - The Movie,"I will recommend this movie to everyone. It is a wonderful story based on the Bible. Even though it is a novel, it is based on the Bible and is a preview of what will happen to the earth when it is time. It is very uplifting and inspirational.I am also reading the ""Left Behind"" Series (also available from Amazon.com). I like to read Revelation along with the the series. It definitely makes you understand the book of Revelation."
1,What the?,"If you are going to buy this movie because you liked the books, don't bother. Left Behind - The Movie doesn't hardly follow the story line of Left Behind - The Book. I was severely disappointed. I didn't even finish watching the movie. Cloud Ten felt it necessary to change not only the smallest of details, they pulled entire scenes straight out of their butts and incorporated them into this flick. If I hadn't read the book I would have had no clue what was going on, but since I did read the books the movie lacked everything. I'm not talking about production flaws or poor acting or low budget. I think the production was decent along with the acting as well. The story itself is what was ruined for me by the film makers. All in all I thought the film was a poor representation of the authors' hard work. Tiz a shame, really."
1,"terrible movie, pedestrian books too","I look at it as a film lover and film student. The direction was passive, the source material and script was shoddy and poorly dramatized. There is not one remarkable shot in the movie...hell, there isn't even a shot that seems like it means anything. It's as if the director just put the camera in front of them and said action, without any thought of it. The acting was bad...I mean, come on, Kirk Cameron? He's not exactly a master thespian and he gets top billing. The movie is simply a thinly veiled attempt at mass conversion. What happened to the ""good"" old days, where the great art came from christianity and other religions? I'd like to give this movie 0 stars, but that won't work on this site."
3,Stick to the books and pray that real directors make it!,"I'm sorry this film is awful! The movie is too dull! I've read the books. I'm reading ""Apollyon"". Steer clear of this movie and pray a real director makes this blockbuster into a movie worthy of the praise of people regardless of faith or nonfaith. My advice stick to the books!"
1,there is no original thought here,"This movie, like the series of books it is based on, is a profound disappointment. I forced myself to read Books 2-6, and became totally bewildered that this second-rate cut and paste adaptation of the visual imagery of Revelation could have any appeal to the christian reading and viewing public. The authors must have a deep contempt for their readers(and viewers). There is no original thought here! The characters are poorly developed caricatures- the females infantile, dependent , dimensionless; the men are invariably rugged, fearless men of profound conviction. Pull the other leg! Life just isn't like that. And the character's names are abominable: e.g. Dr Judah Ben Tsion (Judah, son of Zion? get real!) Every viewer, christian or secular, should be warned off this trash. It is an embarrassment that previously well regarded writers within the christian fold should produce and then disseminate such poorly crafted drivel."
2,This movie left me wanting....,"The Left Behind series, especially the first one that set the stage, are all page-turners worthy of a much bigger effort than this movie provided. So much of the story was left out. My excitement at discovering this film, was quickly dampened by the weak performances. I hope there is more effort put into any future films made of this fabulous book series."
1,A Good Idea Gone Tragically Wrong,"This is a terrible movie. Yes, Kirk Cameron was well cast. That is where the good stops. The other characters are plastic and over-acted. I felt sorry for them. The books are so great. But the screen adaptation leaves out too many details. I had no idea why Rayford became a Christian. There was no development of Rayford's intense desire to spread the word. I really wanted this movie to succeed. I was willing to forgive a lot because I had read the books, but when you get down to the bottom line, you need the book to fill in the excitement and details. What a travesty."
2,The book was way better,"I was a bit disappointed in this movie mostly because it failed to explore the depths of the charactors like the book. Though the basic premise was the same, a lot of important stuff was left out. I didn't feel the same things for these characters like I did for the book. I can understand the lack of detail given the limited amount of time to do the movie. But, it just didn't interest me as much. It wasn't a totally bad movie, however, which is why I give it two stars. I think if you haven't read the book(s) you would enjoy it a little more."
2,Doesn't hold a candle to...,"the Left Behind books. I was disapointed as a Left Behind fan at the outcome of this movie. If you want to know about what life will be like in the earths last days read the Left Behind series by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye and if you are not up to heavy reading, read Left Behind: The Kids Series they are just as good as the adult books just lighter reading. Do not judge the books by the movie, the movie was pitiful compared. Go for the books."
3,Left Behind - The Movie,"While the movie was pretty good I found it disturbing that it didn't follow the book as closely as I felt it should. Also it was very evident that it was a low budget movie. The story was there but the presentation left something to be desired. Though I love the books, I was a little disappointed in the movie."
2,Left Behind: The movie,"This movie could have been so much better. The intro, to appropriately start, is fairly unrealistic. Buck and Chaim are in the crop fields of Israel when the Russians attack. They both run indoors to a massive surveillance facility which, for the most part, comes out of no where. The AntiChrist is anything but charismatic. It is understood that most movies pale in comparison to the book, but this is just so bad. I was also hoping for a series that would not drag on forever. It looks like it will be one movie per book."
5,Gods with US,This movie and series are the best I have seen and read so far. You will sit with anticipation and be on the edge of your seat watching the movie unfold. The movie is sure to captivate all audiences and give them the insight to the Lord. I give the movie a thumbs up appeal for all.
3,"Not that great, but what gives?","I am wondering why the producers decided to release the video version of the movie before the theatrical release? If they want the movie to make money, how can they undermine it by releasing the video first? Overall the movie was average, not much to write home about. The plot was as close to the book as you can get while making a movie. Don't expect much, and you wont be dissapointed."
1,Please just READ the series,"When I first saw the advertisement for this movie, I was absolutely thrilled. I have read every book in the series, and the parts the comercial showed seemed to follow the book. OH PLEASE! My sister-in-law bought the movie and brought it over, she was just as excited as I was to see it.After the first scene, I wanted to turn it off, but let it run straight thru to see if it got better. Never did.The acting for one is horrible. None of the actors had the personality portrayed in the books. So much of the plot was left out, or rewritten that I almost forgot that I had read the book. TOTALLY CONFUSING!To be honest, even if I hadn't of read the books, I still wouldn't have liked the movie. After seeing it, I probably wouldn't even want to read them. It's so boring. But trust me, once you start the books, you won't want to put them down!"
3,Not Bad...,"Well i saw this movie at a friends place,and yes,the dialogue is cheesy at times,what with a sudden conversion of a man who has never prayed before.But yeah,after i saw the first movie i was pretty eager to move on to the next two,cuz the plot moved on fast and though i'm a christian,always held suspense at wats gonna happen next.Its an excellent movie compared to the other tons of crappy Christian movies,but is it Hollywood standard?Well,no.Acting is average with the exception of that pilot guy(dunno his name lol) and special effects look like theyve been stolen from some B-Grade Multiplayer Strategy game.But overall the movie was good,watchable at the very least.I'd recommend it to any Christian,but to others,watch if uve got the time and if uve seen every other movie in the world."
1,A Waste of Thought,"Some people ask me what my problem with Christians is, my answer, PROPOGANDA. Stop praising tools to scare other religions into your thought, because, personally, I don't think I know any christians who enjoy any New Age or ""Pagan"" religions stealing their followers away from them. Besides the fact that this movie is pure propoganda, it's also terrible. THANKS"
4,A Good Start,"I was one of the few who watched the film before reading the books. Now that I am on my third Left Behind Series Book, I realize that the film did stray from some of the details of the series. However, watching the film gave me a good idea of what the books would have to offer for me and got me very interested in reading the complete series. While I agree that I would love to see a more complete production of the books, I felt that this movie was definitely well worth watching and a great start in bringing the Left Behind Series on to the screen."
4,Just the beginning,"First off, I do not feel that this is the best movie out there but I do think that it can be a good starting point for someone who has not read any of the books in this series. My husband bought this movie for me for Christmas knowing how much I am enjoying the books, he had not read any of the books. We set down together on Christmas Day to watch it and to say the least my husband's interest in the book series is piqued. He started reading the first book immediately. Even if die hard fans of these books are somewhat disappointed with this movie I say so what! If it gets 25% new readers interested then it has done a great job!! Even though I am a fan of ""racier"" books and movies, this one is one you can watch and not think ""hey when is the gratuitous sex scene going to happen."" I recommend this movie for everyone and the books as well."
5,You definitely don't want to miss it.,"The creative direction, the casting, everything is incredible. I particularly loved one of the ending scenes in the conference room with the round table. It was if time stood still. And the remnants when everyone ""left"" is something that really tugs at your heart. You definitely don't want to miss it."
5,It's about time,I was so pleased and proud of the movie that words are almost impossible. Being sure not to give anything a way all I feel I can say is that this is a must see movie by all.
4,LEFT BEHIND,"Riveting, Stirring, Highly Recommended to me by my friends and family. Enjoying being a part of the promotional fanfare."
5,Left Behind : It's Fantastic!,I just wanted to let everyone know how great this movie really is. If you don't rent it at Blockbuster or buy it from your local store please see the movie in February when it is released. I believe you will get an insight about how powerful the UN the United Nations really is in our world today. I believe this will encourage you to look closely at the news and definitely the conflict in the Middle East with Israel and those that oppose their occupation of certain areas of their land. Go and see the movie and you will awaken from your day sleep to know that we live a world that is constantly changing right before our eyes.
1,"Finally, A Movie For Stupid People!","All of these five star reviews must be an inside joke because this is about as bad as a movie gets. The artistic equivalent of a soap opera - bad Script, bad acting, and home video quality production. If you believe this was a well made movie there is probobly something truely wrong you and you need some help."
5,A Must See Hit!,"Usually, after reading the book, I am very hesitant of seeing the movie, but I received this as a Christmas present at a ""Greedy Christmas"" party. What a wonderful movie! Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, but I continually awaited the next scene! There is a lot of junk out in video stores and in the theaters these days. What a relief to have a movie that all of the family can watch and that has a message we all need to hear! I predict this movie will be a blockbuster of the best kind!"
4,Tribulation Upon Us?,"Well,how can i start.Great movie.I've already shown it to a bunch of people, who have all said it was pretty good.I think Kirk Cameron did a wonderful job. I never liked him in Growing Pains, but I've came to change my mind. The movie was almost exactly the same as the book,in which I loved the novel.Good flick. I strongly request it to people of all ages."
5,Awesome!! Simply Awesome!!,I have seen this movie about 6 times so far and it is one of the best. It shows true circumstances and situations and the courage to get through them. Kirk Cameron is awesome as is the rest of the cast. He has come a long way from his 'Growing Pains' days. The story grips you to your seat all the way till the end.I can't wait for the sequel!!V.S.
2,"Yes, I know...","I'd heard LaHaye and Jenkins were none-too-happy about how this movie turned out. If this is true, then they were justified in their opinion.Now, don't get me wrong, the message of the story is there. However, do either of us read Christian novels or see Christian movies merely for the message? Might as well forget about books and movies and go straight to the Gospels.Almost everything that made the book stand out in the annuls of Christian Fiction is noticably lacking in this movie. Captain Steele's long time struggling on a diplomatic method of converting those left: gone. The sweet shyness between Buck and Chloe before things take off for them? Gone. In fact, on this last note, we get the feeling they're already together!There were also several liberties taken with the plot which will make it terribly difficult to write or film any of the other books.I recommend the novels heartily, but the movie is only for connesseurs of the series."
3,Your Key to Understanding the Future,"Having read and enjoyed each release of the exciting Left Behind series, we approached the movie with some doubt that the characters and action could come anywhere near to matching the response we have had to the novel. WRONG!! Buck was perfectly cast as was Hattie. Rayford, Chloe and Chaim leave a little disappointment, but everyone's imagination is unique, right? Anyhow, we highly recommond the video, especially to those not likely to enjoy the great adventure by reading the books. We believe that this is an important evangelical outreach to enable all those unaware of the events that WILL OCCUR, if we are to believe that God's Word is true in any sense. Please take a couple hours of your time to see this video. Then, if you are enticed, read the books. Your soul is worth it, especially to your Loving Creator."
1,Not all that we wanted out of this movie,"First of all, let me just say that Christians giving a movie 5 stars to boost it's rating online?....shame. That's flat out lying, and we should be above it.The movie has it's moments, but overall it's slow, it deviates from the plot, and the effects are B-rated at best. We all wanted this movie to succeed, because we all loved the series. And we all wanted this movie to succeed because we all believe in the message. But this movie fell short of what it could have really been--as a movie and a message. Loyal readers especially will feel disappointed.Perhaps the producers were just counting on the ""fanatical followers"" of this series to be an ""untapped billion dollar resource"" in preselling the videos. Too bad they didn't use that resource to make this movie what it could have been."
2,Read the Book and don't bother with the Movie,"The books are awesome. They keep your attention and you can hardly wait to pick it up again. That is, if you can put it down. The movie was poorly directed. I could hardly sit through this movie at all. I had big hopes for this movie, but it didn't even live up to my worst fears."
1,"At least it's not ""The Omega Code""...","Oh my... what a trite movie. The book, yes I read it, was at the best pure ""pulp"". If you are wanting a better ""Christian"" themed movie, watch ""Jesus of Nazareth"". The message is the best part, a loving God, not a ""selective"" one. Rent this if you must, just don't expect much. Purchase at your own risk. Thankfully, a friend had a copy and it didn't cost me a cent. Sorry, just too much of a hateful one-sided message for my taste. Annointed? Not this waste of celluloid."
4,Excellent from a non-christian,"This movie and Left behind II, are excellent stories. I am a non-christian (pagan) with a Christian son and other family members, and I watched it and enjoyed it. I laughed, I cried. Very Powerful."
1,I'm sorry but I have a better interpretation for this..,Left Behind is not propaganda it's a movie for all who are interested. Even if you were never interested in christian theology in the first it's not propaganda. This movie stinks for its lack of story and development as comparison to the novels. The novels based on the book of Revelation. I could have done this movie on a computer and have a better public response than Cloud pictures. before you say anything about the book being right wing conspriracy. let me make on thing plain it's about the second coming of christ. The movie fails to implicate it's seriousness. If you had no interest in left behind series or it's implications no one said you had to watch it. I could easily write off everything I don't like as left wing conspricacy. but that would be hypocritical.
3,It made a bad book into a fairly watchable film,"The Left Behind books are painfully bad - but this film actually corrects most of the book's worst mistakes to turn the storyline into a somewhat watchable film. Peter and Paul Lalonde have heavily edited Jerry Jenkin's ponderous, preachy dialogue so that most of the lines in the film are believable. The chaos that ensues on earth after the Rapture is gratifying to watch, and the storyline is so different than anything you'd see in a mainstream Hollywood movie that it's worth watching just for variety. The character of Hattie Durham - who was an offensively stupid and shallow bimbo in the book - is depicted in the film with more dignity. Unfortunately, people still have a habit of becoming ""instant saints"" the moment they become Christians. I find this strange, since the Lalondes' other films avoid this flaw, but it is true to the book (unfortunately). And, of course, the whole thing is based on an interpretation of the Bible which is very suspect."
1,not good,"This movie is an okay made for video release, but as a theatrical release it is terrible!! As a christian, i realize there is a need to convert people, but do you think watching this shoddily made movie will actually win new Christians for you? This movie was made with good intentions, and sadly just because it is labeled with that ""Christian"" sticker it may actually have some success. As a film though, the acting is bad, the plot is weak, and the quality in general is desperately lacking. Art is an expressive medium, and us Christians need to realize that to use art for God, quality is essential as well. Left Behind lacks quality."
5,Wonderful--a must see!,"When I read a review I take into consideration who wrote the review. So, I am a 21 yr old, female college student. I think that this is a wonderful movie...yet no movie can compare to its book. I absolutely loved and recommend reading the book. I watched this movie with my boyfriend and mom, my step-dad and little brother have seen it, as have many of my friends...and so far everyone that I know of has loved it! It is a must see!"
3,ok movie. Enjoyed it.,"I was waiting to see this so perhaps my expectations were too high, although I know that a great book never translates well on screen. The Gospel was way watered down, but I have to wonder if perhaps the key to reaching unsaved with a movie has to do with making them seek answers to questions this movie may stir up. There should have been a better set up at the beginning with what it was that Irene was talking to Ray and Cloe about, however. Overall, the movie was good as a video or made for TV movie. I can't really see it doing well on the big screen, although the subject matter is the kind that pulls people in. I will go see it and take someone who needs to see it with me."
4,Very good!,This was great. Many people will be upset because it doesn't follow exactly with the books. But if it did it would take like fifteen hours to get through the movie. They did a great job re-writing the script. It is still a wonderfull ministry tool and that is what it is for! I gave it four stars because I could have handled it being a little bit longer!
1,So bad I don't WANT to read the book!,"Short and sweet review: if this is as good as it gets, I'm staying as far from the book as possible. Nothing--and I repeat, NOTHING--with Kirk Cameron can ever be high-quality, and a preachy, cheesy, should-have-been-made-for-straight-to-video movie least of all. Me thinks some folks are watching this through their God-tinted glasses, and not seeing it for the drek it is."
3,A warning that will be unheeded,"A non-Christian will wonder what this is all about. I knew what was going on, being a Christian, but it isn't compelling enough to convince anyone else. I tried watching this a while ago before I found God, but gave up after a half hour. The production was basic. It needs more oompf for attention getting."
2,Nice Attempt,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of this movie. I had not yet read the books, but thought I'd chance it and see the movie first. I thought it might be a refreshing, wholesome break for Christians into the big-budget film arena... Something that could grab the attention of believers and non-believers alike, and deliver a message without being too ""preachy"".I was wrong. The film is mediocre at best. The characters are shallow, and the acting leaves much to be desired.I was hoping for much, much more that what was delivered. I certainly hope the book series is better!"
2,A Semi-missed Opportunity,I really like Cloud Tens flicks but this one reminds me of a TV movie. The product is so slick it ends up almost to be without any real character. I like this movie but it is not that engaging or that good. Cloud Ten's best film is JUDGEMENT which shows real artistry. I like all the other end times films from Cloud Ten better than this one. The actors in LEFT BEHIND are great but the characters are lacking alot. I think that about the book series too. Although I like reading the books the characters are just drones. Cardboard cut-outs of people with stereotypical motivations and sometimes they get a little boring.I think Cloud Ten has done a lot for Christian filmmaking and I know they will do even more great work in the future.
3,Good movie but not the Christian outreach movie I had hoped.,"I enjoyed Left Behind-The Movie. I did, however, find it a little difficult to follow in some places and I am not sure how much you would miss if you had not already read the book. Kirk Cameron was very good in the starring role but a lot of the other characters seemed mis-cast. The group I viewed the movie with agreed that we saw Rayford as a much older gentleman. My main concern is that I fear when it hits the theaters, it will mostly appeal to the audience that is already Christian. The plot and idea of the rapture are too vague to reach any non-Christians who might see the movie. I will, however,encourage people to see it and I feel that we Christians will need to be there to help others understand the significance of the movie if needed. I look forwarded to seeing the next edition!"
3,Entertaining and touching,"Being a fan of the book series I bought the movie mainly to support the Message and cause. After seeing the very bad and painful to watch ""Omega Code"" I expected a poorly done, hokey movie but was pleasantly surprized. ""Left Behind, The Movie"" was much better than I expected. The acting was very well done. The screen play was good most of the time. I found it to be slow occassionally but in general I enjoyed it. It was a great presentation of God's message to believers and others. It kept the interest and provoked questions of my 22 year old, non-church going daughter. Great job! Would have been good if it were longer but it did end as the first book did. Looking forward to the next one. Not sure it will do well in the theater, tho. It might be good to stay with video release."
4,Left Behind - Good Movie - 4 Stars - Man am I relieved!,"It almost hurt to put the DVD in the machine. I wanted so badly for the movie to be good. Even passable would have been ok. Why? Because the ""Christian"" themed movies that I have sampled in the past have mostly been disappointments. Can you say ""Omega Code""? The Left Behind Movie was anything but a disappointment!Admittedly the film did have a small budget and a huge challenge in doing the book series justice as an adaptation. All things considered Cloud Ten did a great job. Am I cutting the film some critical slack because I badly want it to win? Sure, a little. But no more than most people would give to any budget challenged independent film.As for the ""video-before-theatrical"" release concept? Very gutsy. Then again the whole project was gutsy. Will I go and see it again in the theatre in February? Absolutely... I plan on bringing a ton of friends and I hope you do too!"
1,"Leave me behind, please!","It's disturbing that what one used to could only find on late night AM radio one can go watch as a movie in a mall theater. We should fear, like Nazi Germany, any ecumenical movements oe any political movements striving for peace. What next, a movie outlining the Protocol Elders of Zion?Anyway, for those really interested in the Rapture (a term which you will not find in the Bible), read some history: the doctrine of the Rapture was created by the Englishman John Nelson Darby (1800-1882), who spread it around Americ in the mid 19th century. Before Darby, no Rapture doctrine.And, like all propoganda movies (of any stripe or color), the script, acting, even special FX, are bad..."
1,Filmmaking at its worse,"This is one of the most boring, poorly made films that I have ever seen. If it were not for the Christian right, this film would not be playing in theaters. Indeed, it is even too bad for television! A classic case of Christians trying to convert everybody, I doubt that this movie will even appeal to diehard Christian sci-fi fans. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad everything. Avoid like the plaque!"
3,Left Behind 7-year tribulation,Excellent message. This will become one of the most important videos for people left behind after the rapture. You owe it to yourself for where your soul will end up
3,To be fair I'd give it a 3...,I own the movie and would like to see the second one but if it was exactly like the book I'd give it a 5.If you've only seen the movie then I highly suggest reading the actual series. It can be a life changing thing to read all 13 or 14 books in the set. It's a fantastic motivation to renew my beliefs that's for sure.I bought the movie because I loved the book and own the entire set. If I had to do it again I'm sure I'd still buy the movie. It strays just a little too much for me so I'll give it a 3 but it's a good attempt.
2,Poor,"I've read the books and I am a devout Christian and a lover of DVDs. However, this film was a poor adaptation of the book. It only goes through about half of the story and is missing some very important details. Moreover, the price is not something to get excited about. I was excited about seeing Christian movies that could compete with major picture studios. Sadly, I think we still have a long way to go. The visual effects and acting were acceptable (though Rayford's ""coming to Christ"" scene was WAY too weepy). The real problem was the adaptation of the screenplay. I wish this had been developed a little further. Still, the Christian community should be proud of these efforts because they are showing that someday we will be able to compete with Hollywood.Why 2 stars?:This DVD is not worth the pricetag. It is dull and goes through only half of the story. The acting and effects are adequate, but not enough to make this a work of art."
5,It's the end of the world as we know it,"Ever wonder what life would be like if Christ return and you were left behind? Follow four people as they make the descion of a lifetime, when they are left behind a must see for all people."
2,First of series,"Well, the production and sets were rather good for a Christian Production company. Special effects were poor. And the acting was off par. with the exception of Brad Johnson who did a good job. Especially when he realizes that his wife and child are really gone.I know that scripts always have to differ from the book. After all they are dealing with a visual media and 2 hour time frame. But this movie really changes many things. But if the book were written like this script, the book would have been half the size and probably had a more powerful impact.The Special Edition DVD does have The Making of Left Behind, music videos, movie trailer, concert video and actor's messages. All the actors really seemed to believe in this project. Two options were also offered on this DVD, Spanish and closed caption. I would recommend you rent this or borrow from the library before you purchase it."
1,From an athiest who enjoyed the book,"As an atheist, I found the books very compelling and well-written. The pacing of the plot was crisp and the characters were easy to empathize with. That said, I can't believe the authors of the _Left Behind_ series would allow this picture to be released.The movie starts in a different spot than the book. Entire chapters of the book are completely disregarded. The characters are multi-culturalized to appeal to the politically correct among us. The main character has his occupation changed. Overall, the acting is very wooden and the ""pop"" soundtrack is distracting. A noble endeavor in making this movie, and an inevitable one, but this movie lacks everything that makes the books interesting."
1,Unreal,"I wouldn't suggest anyone to watch the movie if they do not believe in ""God"" and going to church and all. And even if they do believe in the Bible, they probably won't believe in this movie. I thought the movie was horrible, it made no sense whatsoever. The ending was so incomplete. The movie led the viewer on the wrong path, I believe. If you are looking for a ""what could happpen"" scenerio, you will not find it in this movie, for this was all mostly science fiction."
4,It was kool,"I am 17 years old and I am not so deep in GOD stuff but I love Him and I adore him. I have to admit the movie could be better but also I have to admit it was a good movie that kept me on my sit all the time. People can say it was the worst movie they have ever seen but they have to admit it that it transmit the message. In my opinion it is a great movie that only needs a few add-ins but it is ok. We can't say that it doesn't match the novel, 'cause which movie we can say that... NONE. I WANT TO TELL TO EVERYONE THAT READS THIS THAT EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T LIKE THE MOVIE TO TELL THAT EVEN IT ISN'T THE BEST MOVIE THEY HAVE EVER SEEN IT HAVE A GOOD MESSAGE THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD LISTEN TO. thx for your attention GOD bless you all"
4,Left Behind Rocks!,"The video Left Behind (starring Kirk Cameron) is the best video for Christian and thriller lovers to come out since The Omega Code. The plot is exciting and realistic. The acting is terrific. I recomend it for everyone who enjoys the awesome Left Behind book series, and for everyone who likes movie's thriling and inspirational. It has something for everyone, and if you like novels on the rapture then this is a MUST SEE-ER. Go to the grand opening in the theaters feburary 2, it's gonna be big. be a supporter of the coolest movie out there for the new millenium! Thanks, I look forward to seeing you there at the theater! -millenium soda girl"
5,good,"This movie was pretty awesome I really liked it! I think this movie will let people think, even though I do not believe that God is coming in secret, but out and loud for Everyone should see him, this movie still works with you.Now to see the last & final chapter to this movie!"
5,You MUST see this video! It could change your life!,"I was little sceptical when I heard that Left Behind would be coming out on video,seeing as I had read all of the books, and loved them. But, I sat at home one day by myself and watched it and the actors did a wonderful job portraying the caracters that I had grown to love in the books. I was moved to tears on more than one occasion, and moved in so many other ways. I have lent my copy to others who have come back saying that it has absolutely changed their lives. Although I am a Christian, you really would enjoy this even if you are of another faith. It is just a terrific movie. Buy it today, or see it in the theatre when it is released in Feb, 2001 God bless!"
2,Left Behind - The Movie,"I have read the book and it get's five stars. The movie falls way short of the book. The characters are changed somewhat ( to the point of changing the race of two people ) and portions of the story line are different. However, the ending does leave you at about the same place as the book"
3,Gospel Message Lacking,"Aside from the the technical aspects of the making of the film (some good points regarding those issues already being addressed)as well as the lack of sound Biblical doctrine and theology the film was sorely lacking within the pure Gospel message that the books possessed. (And I have read all of them thus far save for ""The Mark"") The fact that we are saved by grace though faith in Jesus Christ alone was not adequately presented. Instead, the focus was on the dissappearances and who was behind them. Little thought was realy gone into the why.I'm an Amillennialist. I enjoy the books as ficton. I see both the Law and Gospel within them and am glad of that. However, I did not find that within this film. The name of Jesus Christ was mentioned only once. Now, true, I have read the writers did so in order not to be ""preachy"". But it's a bit sad when Christians refuse to proclaim Jesus's name.Although I understand how and why some of the changes were made...that's one that I do not."
3,Okay To Watch For Entertainment,"This movie is interesting to watch, just for some entertainment. However the movie ends incredibly abruptly, one thinks it's just the end of the scene. But to me the worst and most tedious flaw with 'Left Behind' is Kirk Cameron. His acting ability, at least in this film, is non-existent. The film is a juvenile movie in many ways, but what bothered me the most was Kirk Cameron's acting, or lack of acting ability. Of all the actors in the movie, none of them stars to begin with, he comes across as the least talented. 'Left Behind' is a Christian movie of faith, but who did Kirk Cameron 'sleep with' to get the role of Buck?"
1,BIG disappointment,"I really have enjoyed the Left Behind Books and looked forward to the movie. It is very poor quality, the acting is not professional and they made a stirring story appear trite. I suggest you do not waste your money and be content to stay with the books."
2,Nothing like the book - Very weak gospel message!,"People always warn you of going to see a movie once you've read the book it was based on. I'm not much of a reader, but I couldn't get enough of the Left Behind book series. They were 5 star for sure. I was anxious to see the video, but was very disappointed once I did. The acting wasn't the greatest, but I could get over that. What I couldn't accept was the water-downed, almost non-existent gospel message. I think the name Jesus Christ was mentioned only TWICE if that. I could not show that movie to a non-Christian friend and expect them to be challenged by it at all. I didn't find it convicting at all. There is no comparision. I'll stick with the books."
4,Books Made Into Movies,"I found this to be an excellent movie; however, it would have been better if I had not read the book first. The book was much more detailed and, as always when a book is made into a movie, they make a lot of revisions. I kept expecting certain things in the movie that were in the book, so that was a little disappointing. I bought the DVD before it was released to the theatre circuit and am glad I did. I would like to see the rest of the Left Behind books made into films. Perhaps Billy Graham or John Hagee will sign on to do this."
1,"A movie that everyone should see, and no one should believe","This movie is horrible. How can anyone think that this even COULD happen, much less WILL happen. It was presented in such a campy way, that I doubt if even the actors believed it could happen.Rotten, bad, silly and dumb! Furthermore, the writer of the Left Behind series is a rude arrogant jerk. I have heard him on the radio and he is not a nice man."
5,left behind - the movie,This was well made. This story follows the bible closely. Events in the film will hopefully wake people up andrealize that God is for real.
3,A Little Clearer,"I received the DVD as soon as it was available and watched it immediately. As I normally do with DVD's, I watched the ""extras"" first. The trailers from the other films of Cloud Ten really frightened me. Was this to be a film suitable for a religous school retreat or a serious attempt to make a major motion picture.The answer: Neither. The film was well done and well acted, however it is suitable for network TV, rather than theatrical release (It's a TV movie).I've listened to all the books through Audible's service and frankly found the Movie more plausible than the first book. The explanation of Nicolae's rising to ultimate power makes more sense, in relation to the US. The explanation of disappearances provided by Nicolae is reasonable, as well. Belive me, these are two points necessary for suspension of belief.The Christian music seemed a little heavy at times, but overall I enjoyed the movie. My wife, who had no exposure to the books, also enjoyed the movie."
5,Awesome Film!,"I was unsure if I would enjoy this movie, because other Christian films on the Rapture that I've seen have seemed somehow short of the mark, and also w/ all the hype the books have been given, I was just worried. However, I must say that they did an EXCELLENT job! There are many familiar faces involved, besides Kirk Cameron & Chelsea Noble. The story drags you in from the get-go, much as the books must. By the end of the film, I wanted more, I couldn't wait for more, and I can't wait to read the books now, which I had also been putting off. Watching the video also made me unable to wait for its Feb. 2nd release date in the theatres. I will most certainly pay to watch it on the big screen, and reccommend it to everyone else as well! This film is inspiring and just generally well done."
4,Great movie based on a great story!,"Left Behind: The Movie is a wonderful adaptation of the book. While some of the details from the book was either omitted or slightly changed, the basic tempo of the story stays true to the integrity that Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins laid down in the written version. The information that is received about the Tribulation and the salvation message is clear and precise. As someone who had not read the New Testament book of Revelation, I was intrigued to pick it up and compare details. I recommend the movie as a witnessing tool and encourage all who view it to take their friends to view it as well. Whether a believer or a non-believer, the story is strong, acting well done, and the action suspensful."
4,Better than I expected.,"Let me start off by saying I have never read any of the books& nor am I a fanatical follower trying to boost any favorable reviews for this disc. I bought this as a gift for my wife with no intentions of even watching it. But I did give it a chance. I was instantly turned off by the full-screen ratio. However two minutes into it, I was really hooked. It does comes across as more of a slick t.v pilot than a theatrical release. At the end though, I was ready for another installment. With all the legal red-tape involving the authors, I don't know how likely future movies will be. However if they make'em, I'll buy'em. Also, a note to Cloud Ten: there's nothing wrong with making a HIGH QUALITY ""straight-to-video"" movie series. So if Feb.2nd doesn't meet your expectations. Don't throw in the towel!"
2,Very Disappointing --Should have stuck with Book Story,"~When I walked into Blockbuster Video, Left Behind -- the Video, seemed to be waiting there just for me.I went out to buy a DVD player (I had been planning to, already) and could not wait to watch it.However, my enthusiam was misplaced, and yours will be, too, if you have read the book(s). The books are insightful, instructional, and inspirational, but the movie was anything but.They surely would have a HIT had they simply stuck with the storyline in the book, and produced Many videos~~ -- not tried to cram so much into this movie by changing the storyline.I am still reading the books -- can't seem to get enough of them, but I am recommending the movie for those who haven't read the books only if they NEVER intend to read the book.~"
1,"Review of ""Left Behind""","This was truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I have read the book, which I found entertaining despite the fact that it was terribly written. This movie, in contrast, did little to hold my interest. It starts out reasonably exciting. The sequence in the airplane, though very different from the book, was a bit suspenseful. However, the rest of the movie is simply dull. The acting is terrible, the characters are difficult to relate to, and the plot is incredibly slow. I think the worst, almost laughable scene was the conclusion, in which Carpathia is ""hypnotizing"" the United Nations representatives. The sequence was idiotic, as was the acting. This film would have been better had it been released on TV. It was not motion picture material. I highly recommend that you skip the film and just read the book."
1,"Good Book, BAD Move","Let me just say that I am a huge fan of the Left Behind books. I typically finish one of just a few days. But I was very disappointed with the this movie.A local music described the quality of this movie as barely on the same level as a cheesy made for cable movie that you might see on USA Networks. I would have to agree. The whole movie had a ""cheap"" feel to it. Kirk Cameron is just not meant for serious acting. The special effects were laughable and the acting was poor overall. And of course, the book was much different that the movie as well.Don't waste you money. Stick with the books."
1,Don't even rent it!,"What a horrible movie. It has nothing to do with the acting. You can't blame bad acting when they're working with a terrible script. This film did absolutely no justice to the original text. Among its problems, first and foremost is the omition of essential characters, and the adding of pointless ones. If you decide not to heed my advice, and order it anyways, fast forward any scene involving the girl with the squigily mark on her forehead, (what the hell is that thing?).If you're a fan of Christian mythology, or anything to do with revelation, then by all means, the story is fantastic. A cross between Tom Clancy and the Bible. But, and it's kind of ironic that I say it this way, for the LOVE OF GOD, read the book, avoid the movie."
5,A MUST SEE MOVIE,THIS IS AN AWESOME MUST SEE MOVIE FOR BOTH CHRISTIANS AND NON CHRISTIANS. IT SHOWS HOW THE FINAL DAYS MAY OCCUR AS TOLD IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION. GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR. 5 STARS.
4,From Novel to Film,"I have read every one of the Left Behind Series and think the ongoing storyline is exciting and Biblically accurate. This film made from the first book has done an excellent job. Of course there are some changes but they do not seem to distract from the story. The scene in the airplane and the immediate after effects is the most powerful statement I've ever seen. The anguish of the parents whose children have disappeared touched me in a way no other movie has. I highly recommend this video as a witnessing tool and look forward to the ""big screen"" release in February."
4,Thought-provoking,"Left Behind is a must-see for everyone, whether you are ""religious"" or not! It's very thought-provoking about the future and what is in store for the world. It is fictitious, of course, as no one knows exactly what the Rapture will be like. If you want to study more about the end times or the Rapture, there are many books and commentaries available through libraries or websites for further research. This movie comes to the BIG SCREEN FEBRUARY 2nd, 2001. Take a friend to see it!!"
5,Powerful Evangelical Movie,"I have been reading the ""Left Behind"" book series and this movie gave me more understand to this series of books. When I was watching this movie, I thought I became apart of this movie. It made me realise that I need to believe more than just know about Jesus Christ. When you believe in Jesus Christ and give your life over to him, you will not have to worry about being left behind."
2,I was disappointed,"Standing on it's own, this movie might be as awesome as a lot of people have indicated, but as a fan of the book series, I was really disappointed in the differences. Granted, no movie is ever a straight takeoff of the book, but I think they could have made the movie a bit longer and stayed with the book a bit closer. For instance, Buck didn't get Hattie her job at the UN. In fact, Buck and Hattie didn't even know one another before the Rapture. Buck doesn't meet Rayford until much later. And Chloe's ""attachment"" to Buck just doesn't make sense with the information in the movie. In the book, their attraction is logical. I was just really disappointed. This could have been the first in a great series of movies to go along with the books, but I don't think I'd buy a second one if they made it (despite the fact that I finished the first eight installments of the book series in about five weeks)."
2,"Good books, bad movies",The movies are cheaply done and what is worse is that they don't follow the story in the books. I hope one day the books can be made into movies worth seeing.
1,Not what I expected,"This video wasn't up to par with the book. The book smelled like cookie dough, however, this movie smelled like rotten bubble gum. Anyway, the visual effects for this feature seem outdated and un-good. Most of the acting is rather cheesey.Buy it if you're really into the series, otherwise, skip it."
2,The movie was disappointing................,I voraciously read the serious and loved it! I immediately assumed that the movie would mirror the excitement of this incredible series. Some of the characters were introduced in the movie in a way that differs from the series. I was unfortunately disappointed....The movie should be in mini series format that closely follows the book.
5,Left Behind -- Will You Be??,This is an excellent movie about the end times. It really makes you think about where you are and where you should be when Christ returns. Watch it and then decide for yourself
5,See it! Believe It! Do something about it!,Outstanding! The movie is great but yet tame! The actual situations will be MUCH worse but only so much can be shown in a movie with a budget!! The movie depicts what is fast approaching --the redemption of the believers from this earth. But allow it to BE just a movie for you! Be prepared yourself and BELIEVE in the Lord Jesus Christ and let HIS reality overshadow the reality of being LEFT BEHIND. This is true and no one need be left! The truth IS out there! Hope to see you at the exit resurrection!
2,Disappointing,"I read the book and it was excellent. The day I finished the book, I immediately rented the video. The movie excluded many important details that helps you understand the plot. It also excluded a lot of information from the Bible that the book explained. While Kirk Cameron did an excellent job of playing Buck Williams, and Nicolae Carpathia was played with perfection by Gordan Currie, the other actors and actresses were not cast very good. The reason I gave it over one star is the last scene, which was very suspenceful."
2,Not THAT bad!,"OK, so it does move a little slowly, but then again, so do the books. I think it would be wise to read the novel FIRST, THEN see the movie. Doing it the other way around could lead to confusion. Personally, I rather enjoyed the movie. I didn't feel preached to as others seem to have been. I rented this from Blockbuster, so it wasn't a great expense. The only complaint I have is that there are already at least 8 books in the series, with another due 7/01. Are they planning on making a movie to correspond with each novel? Perhaps they could take a lesson from Stephen King. He insisted on producing ""The Stand"" for television, making three two-hour segments since a 6-hour movie would be intolerable, no matter HOW good it is!"
5,Life Changing Movie,"Left Behind has been given a lot of criticism from the media as a low budget film. On the contrary, I feel it was a fabulous movie that keeps you on the edge of your couch the whole time. Caution: THIS MOVIE WILL GET TO YOU! I cried, I felt nervous, most of all, I am now more zealous for the cause of Christ and reaching as many people with His message before he comes back for those who love Him. See the movie in theatres opening February 2, 2001."
2,Dissappointing,"I have followed the Left Behind series since the first installment back in 1997. While they are not literary genius, they are fast-paced and enjoyable, regardless of your theology. The movie, however, was not enjoyable - except for maybe a moment or two. Overall it was campy. The acting was mediocre and the production was sloppy.The books are much better, as are the radio-dramatized versions available on cassette."
2,"Read the book, forget the movie","Movie left me feeling empty. Does injustice to the book. I was looking forward to watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you are not a reader, listen to the unabridged tapes or CDs."
3,"Good, but not Great","Having read the book first, I was somewhat disappointed in the movie. The idea and intent are worthy, but the book series is much more rewarding - a MUST READ."
3,Unfair,Why is the video or DVD not closed captioned? My fiancee is hearing impaired and she misses out on the experience of the Left Behind Movie. Is it assumed that only non-hearing impaired people would be interested in learning more of Christ's return? I think it is a shame that the movie maker's would make such an assumption.
3,What Happened to the Story!!,"I am disappointed in thid video. Too much was left out of the story to get the true point across about the end times. I do not think this video will reach out to non-believers and draw them into Christianity. The video was too brief and Christianity was toned down. If more had been included from the book, such as Buck's friend in England,everyone praying for Buck when he was in the room with Carpathia, the relationship he had with the Editor at the Chicago,,,all those and more, would have helped to be more meaningful."
1,inserting a soddering iron into eye socket would be more entertaining,Terrible acting coupled with outdated fear based theology left me feeling deeply sorry for those who could watch something like this and see it as inspirational or a step in the right direction. Just another sorry attempt to take the fear based exclusivism of religous christian fundamentalist main stream and a dismal failure at that.
1,Very disapointed,"I have now read all the books that are out and have loved them a lot. However I was very disapointed in the movie, which only went part way through the first book. With Nicolae Carpathia becoming the Secretary General of the United Nations. I understand that movies can't create all the nuances that a book can, but I was hoping for more. I do think the movie could have gone a lot further showing some of the disasters that are to come. I don't reccomend this movie at all. I do however reccomend all the books in the series."
4,Left Behind,This movie was somehing that I was looking forward to. I had a problem with some of the story being left out in the movie. It got the point across but like most movies that come from books it didn't have the impact that the books did.
2,Disappointed,"As usual, the movie did not follow the book. The daughter was in California not at home when the people disappeared. Her car was never hijacked since she flew in from California. The actors did not portray the characters as well as they should have. I really believe these books (have read all and will read the latest The Mark"" this week), should be made in a mini-TV series. The one movie based on the first book ""Left Behind"" does no justice for the rest of the series of books. I have really enjoyed the books. Recommend you buy the books, not the video."
1,"Sad, Really Sad",The best part of the movie was when the 143 million christian right wingers disappeared. If I believed in god I would have said thankyou. With their disappearance there would be no more of these movies. I thought the R rating meant adult not religious. Same old fairy tale that has been retold for 2000 years.
1,Trash,Stupid protestant false stuff! There is no such thing as a pre-trib rapture! Thank God I'm Catholic!!!!Rapture will be AFTER the trib. not before!
1,"Left Behind, the movie","I have NOT yet seen the movie; but, have read your reviews, and, eagerly(I think!!) await the appearance of the series in movie form (which is supposed to open on February 2). The books are riveting...I am fascinated by the total opposites in view (by your reviewers, thus far), regarding the film. However, if it DOES come to my area on the big screen, I shall watch it, although I CANNOT IMAGINE Kirk Cameron, as Buck...WHO cast this movie..and, did they READ the books???"
3,"It's probably closer to 2 stars, but...","The ""blockbusters"" Hollywood cranks out - full of violence, ugly language, etc., are so tiresome, that ANYTHING different is a breath of fresh air.""Left Behind"" has many good points, but the movie went a little slow. The acting was good but the plot kind of stumbled along in places.If you've any interest in different interpretations of Biblical Prophecy, you'd probably enjoy this movie. The Christian message of unconditional love and LIVING the Golden Rule in our lives really does shine through this movie.I don't agree with the religious interpretation that we'll all be WHOOSHED to heaven one day, but that's another story.Whether or not you agree with the specific doctrinal message, it's a good tool for opening discussion with your children about living a Christian life and being considerate to those who hold differing views."
3,Just go Read the Bible,This movie was utterly horrendous. The acting was atrocious and the story was very contrived. The only good part was when the antichrist killed a man during a meeting and made it look like someone else did it. That was ok (although it was shown horribly). As I said above...go read the actually BOOK this stuff is based on. Not the horrible thought out Left Behing Bookseries...but the BIBLE! You'll get much more information and a better idea of what happens. But I do want to congratulate the gentlemen for trying.PS: Was the actress who played Chloe the same as that one girl from the Faculty who took off her clothes? Naughty naughty.
1,Mind bogglingly awful,"This movie is without doubt one of the worst I have ever seen. The acting was wooden, the editing woeful, and the incidental music laughable. It all made sense when I realised I was watching a christian movie."
5,Left Behind the movie best christain Film of our time,"Left behind the Movie the best Christain Film of our time if you read the book and read your bible along with it and talk with a pastor, You can understand the message that goes along with it.. if you are a christain there is a happy message within it but if you are not a christain now is the time to give your life to christ, now before christ comes to take all the christain back to heaven with him."
5,Everyone must see Left Behind,"Everyone needs to see this movie and read the series! this movie will show in theatres on Feb. 2, 2001. Please go see it and support this movie, so that they can continue to make more movies of the Left Behind series. This is about the world's future, so after you watch this you need to study Revelations. I know it can be confusing, but it's important."
2,Confusing and botched,The movie was too confusing and attempted to re-write the books (Left Behind & Tribulation Force) I made the mistake of seeing the movie first and then attempting to read the books. Too much was added and important information was deleted or altered to make the movie. The screenwriters should have attempted to stick to the book in a better method and not skip into the second book before completing the first.
1,Books Good - Movie Bad,"I have read all eight published (non-kids) volumes of the Left Behind series and I absolutely love them (even though I do not necessarily agree with the biblical interpretations underlying them). BUT, the movie is awful. The acting is terrible, the story line is somewhat modified from the book (the drunken airplane passenger scene is not at all like the book) and I agree with others that the story plods along. The book is an excellent read. In fact, I think all eight books so far are page-turners. I was anxiously awaiting the movie and was very sorely disappointed in the whole thing. I know it was a low-budget movie, but it really looks it."
2,OH SO DISAPOINTING,IF YOU READ THE BOOKS DON'T SEE THE MOVIE!!!! IT LEAVES YOU VIRTUALLY HANGING. THE ACTORS ARE MEDIOCRE THE PLOT IS SO CHOPPED UP YOU WHO READ THE BOOK WON'T RECOGNIZE IT. THEY TREID TO SQUEEZE THE WHOLE FIRST BOOK IN THE SHORT TIME OF THE FILM.
4,"A riveting, compelling story","This is the first ""Christian"" movie I've watched, and I was surprised at the quality of the acting and direction. The music's great, too. The action and intrique kept me on the edge of my seat, always wanting to know what was next. My husband bought the movie for us, and now we're watching it with our friends. One friend, a grown man who was not a Christian before watching the movie, cried when he saw all the grieving parents whose children had gone to Heaven without them. Our friend came to church with us the next day and joined! He's eager to learn more about the story behind the movie, and he doesn't want to be Left Behind. Share this movie with all your family and friends."
5,Best Christian film!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Left Behind. I have never before seen such great acting and realism in a Christian movie! Even my son,who as of yet is still not Christian, loved the movie and said it was great; albeit a bit scary. I was glad he said that, as it means he is seriously thinking about the truth of it; even though it is fictionalized account.I am anxiously waiting for a sequel which I hope they are planning!"
3,The Movie is good but follow up with the book series!,I found this movie to be well made and interesting. It is great for the family. Follow up with the book series is required to get all the nitty gritty details. This is life changing!
4,Left Behind,Wonderful movie that tells of things that have been forgotten about by most people. It is the story of the apocalypse and what happens to those that are left behind.People are missing everywhere and no one knows why. Then a small group of people begin to figure out what is really going on. But can the convince the rest of the world before it is too late? Also a great cast.
3,"Good game,but................................","This game is fun to play with.The placese are beautiful.But there is something who stinks in this game,that if you must catch the thief at the hang liders,it`s hard.I tried many times to catch the theif in this one,but I only did it right just not more than 12 times.The boats and the motors are more easier and I think that Barbie Detective 1 is more easier than this one.This one is good but not if you must catch the thief on the hang liders."
1,Buy Nancy Drew Instead,"I am a fan of the Nancy Drew series and thought i would pick this up for under $10.Well i wish i would have just saved my money.Poor graphics,Barbie is hard to control.Also they dont give you too much of a background on the story.So your lost,going blindly through the whole game.So save your money and buy the Nancy Drew series.Better graphics,conrols,and a better story."
1,Boring! I'd rather kiss a toilet seat,This is so dumb. I was 7 or 8 eight years old when I got this. AT first I tought I wasn't thinking. But even my mom could not figure this out. THe latest clue I found was this shadow walking around the beach. Seccond thing is that you go blind walking around without even knowing what your doing.DO NOT BUY!
1,worse than the 1st,This game has bad graphics and its hard to move barbie. when you have to type in your name for your badge they don't have some of the most popular names. if you are thinking about buying this game save your money and buy a barbie doll instead (you could act out your own mystery).
2,Detective Barbie 2: The Vacation Mystery,"My 8 old daughter hates this game, she would rather play the younger game Princess Bride or Pet Rescue. The graphics are great and the music fine. The premise for the game is great, however she nor I could not figure out the game, the help screen was useless. She managed to get a few clues, but then couldn't get any farther with the game. She got frustrated, as well did I. Maybe we got a 'bad' disk, but no-one will help us. I'll wait a few years and buy her the Nancy Drew series."
2,Not Impressed,This game was hard for me to figure out more or less my daughter. I can get half way through it then I get stuck. The only way my daughter can play it is if I'm right there helping her. The graphics and sound are nice but thats about it. The Help screen is useless. I don't recomend this game.
1,Terrible,This was the worst game I have ever played.Pros-The graphics are good.cool mysteriesCons-HUGE Bug when you enter the gazeboThe bug is in every copyI bought 2 copies and the bug was in both.DONT BUY THIS GAME
2,Put me to sleep,Jonathan Goldman is a great author and very informative. In this DVD there was too much talking and very boring. My sister and I fell asleep within the first 20 minutes. I have other products by Jonathan and have loved them. This one I would not recommend unless you have trouble sleeping at night.
3,Little weird,The DVD has a home movie sort of feel although it is obvious it is professional. The information is helpful but I am not inclined to load it and watch it again and again... moves slow.
5,awesome video,"It was informative and helpful. It explains what some people think of as mystical, in a scientific way, showing that ancient mysticism is actually science- the science of sound/frequencies. It was worth way more than I paid for it. It will change your life to watch this video."
5,It's difficult walking all day in this unpredictable ...,"It's difficult walking all day in this unpredictable L.A. weather, but having a nice comfortable pair of shoes sure helps! When style is more important than comfort, it's good to know that I can get comfort walking with these Scholl's inserts! One thing, though, is that it takes a few days to get used to the new inserts. Just walk with them as you would in a new pair of shoes and you should be fine."
5,AWESOME,"100 + % or more!THIS IS THE BEST CATFOOD YOU COULD EVER GET YOUR KITTY, I'VE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER 20YRS.I PURCHUSED 3 BAGS (GREEN & ORANGE WITH HAIRBALL REMEMDY) REALLY HELPS WITH THE HAIR BALL PROBLEMSCATS HAVE, MAKES THEIR HAIR SHINE AND AN OVERALL HAPPY KITTY. I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHUSE THESEPRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE AS WELL AS MY SISTER.BLESS YOU AND YOURS!gk"
5,Old Style Music,"I am a fan of the old style country music and this is a good example. I ordered it after listening to samples on cdnow. After recieving the cd , I am very pleased."
5,NOTICE,"Just a follow up to a previous poster, ISBN 1879751372 is the translation by Schultz-Behrend (the one you consider poor)."
4,Mining for the Motherload,"Though out of print, this book can now be found under the title ""Personal Bible Study Methods - 12 Ways to Study the Bible on Your Own"" ISBN 0-9669895-0-2. Why settle for picking up little nuggets from your pastor or radio preachers, when you can go for the motherload? Rick Warren does a great job showing you how to dig for the gold in God's word on your own. He show's you how to use Bible study aids in such a way that you will never have to question again what God has to say about anything in your life. This should be required reading for every serious Christian and I would recommend that it be a required adult course in every Christian church."
3,Only OK,"This game gets boring afterawhile. There is no chalenge, you don't even try to win anything. It froze my computer many times. You pick the two people you want, pick the moves, the costume, and then preform. They make the game look better than it is. It may be fun for little girls."
2,Barbie trips up on this one,"I'm a big fan - along with my 4 nieces - of the Barbie video games. (We own 5 or 6 of them between us.) But this time Mattel missed the mark. You must be very careful of the system requirements before you purchase this game. It crashed one computer and brought another to a standstill, constantly locking up the program. (Yes, we were above the minimum system requirements with the second computer.) The choices for clothing and stage setting are limited and not fully interchangeable. Most of the dances were one move repetitions once they got into presentation. The speaking parts were halting and the movements were either jerky or sluggish. We may have had a bad CD, but I don't think so. Gamers, buy this one with caution."
2,Dancing For The Gold,"I think that the Generation Girls Cd-rom is very boring to me. I played it and thought that it wasn't that fun. You couldn't create your own dances, people or music. I really like doing more karoke then this Barbie Gotta Groove Game."
4,As expected,"This former one-hit wonder from Connecticut can now amend and extend her resume by one more hit with the first single from her second album. The single ""She's Like the Wind"" was originally performed by Patrick Swayze, and was also covered by David ""The Hoff"" Hasselhoff, but this version coverts a part of the song to rap and features vocals by Tony Sunshine.Another song that I found interesting was the duet with Shaggy, covering the Roberta Flack hit ""Feel Like Making Love"", but with a reggae spin. Lumidee's vocals match well with Shaggy on this one, which I actually prefer to the first single. A good dance track is ""Crazy"" featuring Pitbull, and you might also like ""The Whistle Song"" featuring Wyclef Jean. Other fairly good tracks are ""Cute Boy"" and ""Did You Imagine"".This album is okay, largely due to the guest artistes, but not exactly outstanding, which is precisely what we expected. Rated: 3.5 starsAmanda Richards, May 5, 2007"
1,she still sucks,"no offense but this girl has little talent and i don't understand why this album came out. uh ohh sucked too. don't understand why this age group can't grasp the concept of real music. they hear so much crap they take the less of all the evils and call it great.i think people will still bump some of this cd because the beats are nice. but unless you can turn the beat up load enough to drown out her failed singing attempts, you'll be assaulting your ears needlessly. take my advice and stay away unless you feel the need to drown your sorrows in a pathetically, schizophrenic mix of music."
3,Trouble With Kids,"The Trouble With Grownups is a book that teaches you about the hard leason every child has to over come, that yes sometimes their parents will say,""No"" or ""Don't Do That."" This book is a great book to read to your child. It will help them understand that parents have a hard time as much as children do. It is a fully illistrated book that has a great story that can capture the child's imagination. I to read this as a child and it helped me to respect my parents and family. The greatest part in this book is when the parents turn around and start acting like children, to show the cubs how hard it is to be a parent. Maybe, if every parent did this we would have more respectful children. All in all this is a great book to read and highly recomend people to read the other Berenstain Bears books."
4,Nice Berestain Bear Selection!!!,"The Berenstain Bears and the Trouble with Grownups teaches children that they, their voices, can and should be heard. This selection allows them to see that children have points to make when speaking and discussing and it allows them to see that grownups have points to make when speaking and discussing. The children are starting to learn that parenting doesn't come with an instructional manual and that grownups have bad days just like them. I didn't give this book a five because I don't agree with the yelling and minor name-calling that takes place. I think the point of the book could have been delivered without putting disturbing images in my little boy's head. Of course, I'm not saying that arguing of any kind should be made to be ""sugar-coated"" and look pretty. I do want to stress that the ""mean-ness"" in this book was taken a little too far. It is a great book to get children to think of more complex issues, situations, and resolutions."
4,The Trouble With Children,The Trouble With Grownups is a good childrens book that every child must read. It will teach them the importance of respecting their parents and show them that even though they may think their life is hard.Their not alone parents also can have a ruff time. In this book brother and sister bear learn this and learn how they've been acting. Their parents start acting like them to show them what it would be like the other way around. I to read this as a child and I to learned my leason. Kids have it to easy these days maybe if they read this book it will teach them the importance of parents and respect.
5,a must HAVE,this is a MUST HAVE book .... great to refer to as you plow through Mongolian Travel and Adventure Books..... I'm thrilled to own it! Glad it was 'finally' published!
2,A Perversion of the Work,"If you can find a copy of the first edition, then you'll find an interesting book. The author gave that printing a fresh and authentic account of his time with Lord Pentland and his time of stumbling through the Work. Unfortunately, that edition was not well received in established Gurdjieff circles and the author was forced to do an extensive re-write. This current edition is 2nd rate, at best. You'll notice many glowing reviews and high ratings here, but that is because these were written by the author's students after having been given the task as a Work assignment. You'll be much better off sticking to the classic core books written by those who do not use the Work to earn a living. The author's later books are better reading, but this one is best left behind."
4,The Gurdjieff Work: An inside-out perspective,"An innovative in-depth look at the Gurdjieff (Fourth Way) Work from the inside out. It gives a very personal and immediate account of the author's spiritual trials and searches. It is frighteningly honest in description and pulls few punches.It is an advanced work showing the effects of The Work two generations removed from Gurdjieff's immediate influence. It is an immediate expression of the practical application of The Work. Not recommended as an introduction to Gurdjieff for the beginner, but highly recommended for a reader who has some knowledge of Gurdjieffian ideas and practices."
3,i have the original first edition of this book and its different .,"I have the first edition of this book which is absolutely different than this book , i cant find the original version on amazon for some reason . anyway the writings about john pentland are he parts i got anything out of , regardless it fells like an honest account of a seeker, i suppose but it left me feeling dry ad uninterested in the authors words i never finished it. although i have seen other things by the author i liked much better. this was .. i don't know something is missing"
3,"Verbose, but can be useful","I got this book expecting to get a feeling for the teachings of Gurdjieff; William Ptterson's mentor was John pentland who was a president of the Gurdjieff Society in America. But I got only a glimpse for my effort of going throgh this voluminous book. But I am greatful to Wm. Patterson for writing about the ""Rare-born Mystic"", Alfred Julius Emmanuel Sorenson who took the name ""Sunyata"" after seeing Ramana Maharshi.William Patterson had the good fortune to see and talk to Sunyata, but I wonder whether he really got the basic message from Sunyata. Sunyata means total emptiness. What a beautiful name! As Douglas Harding so clearly demonstrates that interinsiclly we are all total emptiness which is always ready to be filled with unconditional love. Maybe William got this, but he doesn't show any evidence of it in his book. Yet this book is worth a hop-step-and-jump perusal.Love and best wishes."
5,Buy and Enjoy in 1080HD,"As a professional broadcast cameraman,I think these DVD's have some of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in railroad/train video productions. This a great set of various trains and steam engines. The price for what you get is a super bargain and the quality of the original video in HD and DTS audio is simply superb."
3,Metal Locker?,The picture shows this item in what looks like a metal locker. The item I recieved came in a normal slipcase. Did it ever come in such a package? If not amazon should change the picture.
5,"Wow, I love it",This is by far the best heating pad to work well for the knee joint. I have osteoarthritis. This wonderful product came on November 7th. Very Pleased with it.
3,Perfect for knees,"The Therma Moist Petite Heating Pad heats up quickly and does get extremely hot on the highest setting of 150 degrees. You can set the timer from, 15 up to 60 minutes. It has a fairly long cord, and the heat does have a moist feel. I find that this petite size is perfect for knees, as it is narrow enough to fit and easy to adjust with the velcro tab. The only drawback I find with this heating pad is the fact you have to reset it to zero the next time you want to use it. You then have to set your preferences again. This is not a big deal, however, and is only a matter of inconvenience. The pad works great and does what it's supposed to do."
2,Heating pad,"I made a mistake thinking I was buying a Thermaphore heating pad. This is not equal lto a Thermaphore. You feel the wires coming through to your back, and it scrunches up, not lying flat. I subseuently bought the Thermaphore locally."
4,Great product,"My only disappointments is the fact the temp dial has to be reset to 0 before it will turn on again (Safety issue i imagine) and it's hard to read the control dials, temperature and time.Moist heat works well for sprains for sure. Delivery was prompt."
5,very good advice on cost saving ideas,"Diane Warner has been there and done that. She has alternative tips for ways to have a dream wedding without going into Ch. 11. Her ideas don't seem ""chintzy."" According to Warner there is a whole universe of talented friends out there, from florists to photographers to musicians. If you like her book, enjoy NOTES FROM THE M.O.B. (mother of the Bride) by Sherri Goodall, great ideas and humor from the POV of the mother of the bride."
2,Disappointed,i bought 2 digital frames and both are not working. I was promised for replacement but even after 10 days of promise did not receive the replacement.
1,Autoturn off makes it worthless,"The motion sensor is not very sensitive...about 3 inches. After an hour the LCD turns off. There is no way to disable the auto-turn off feature. I found, that once off it was forgotten. That's a lot of money for a blank picture frame to never be looked at. It needs to stay on - to draw attention so people will ""ooh"" and ""ah"" at it.Customer support claimes there is no way to disable it. So I sent it back."
3,Easy to use but poor resolution,"This product is extremely user-friendly and great for my parents who are not very tech-oriented. It is easy to slip the digital camera card directly into the frame, but the process of scrolling through and viewing photos is quite slow. The biggest disappointment is the screen resolution. The only photos that look good are close-ups. It would also be nice if there was the option to connect it to a computer to transfer images that way and if it had more internal memory capacity (only stores 8 photos)."
3,Fixing the auto turnoff (power saver),"I agree the auto turnoff is a real annoyance. Especially since you have to scroll around and reselect your photo directory and hit the play button if the unit has been off for two or more hours. This power saver feature can be easily bypassed by placing a white sheet of paper about 1/8"" in front of the motion sensor windows. I slip a sliver of paper about 1/4"" x 1"" into the motion sensor windows tucking the ends behind the metal. Then I pull it out in the middle about an 1/8"" so it arches over the sensor windows and can reflect back from one window to the other. It take a little trial and error but the unit will display indefinitely this way."
1,Worthless,I found this to be hardly good comedy. I Know it is silly and goofy which is ok.But certainly not worth the money .
4,A good start,"I mainly viewed this because I had seen a few episodes here and there, and this first one featured Robin Ellis (of ""Poldark"" fame). I thought it was a good start for the series and will view more episodes as I have the opportunity."
5,Recipe for good living,"Best of the best. Zany enough for Python fans, plot driven enough for non-Python fans.....this is as funny as funny gets."
2,THEY BOTH NEED THERAPY!,"Lots of hot seduction scenes but not much of a story line. She's a Ph.D. in human sexuality (with little experience) and he's an ex-cop with a ""problem"" since his ex-wife left him. He seemed a little too ""Beta"" for a cop. She has taken over the sexual advice column in a magazine and someone is out to kill her. He's sent to protect her. Their relationship is too hot then cold to be believable."
2,"Can the Same Man be Admirable, Yet Unlikeable?","Yes.A long hard slog. The problem with a biography of Miles is that he had a long life but peaked early, so the action ended halfway through.Also, although he was an effective combat commander of admirable courage, Miles's overweening ambition made him a real pain."
4,Great Baritone Uke for the Price,"I already play a tenor uke, which was made by Oscar Schmidt, that has excellent finish and tone, and that I paid much more than for this baritone uke. I read that the baritone uke tunes the same as a guitar, which got my interest. So, when I saw the 70% price reduction, I decided to try it out, and I am very glad that I did. It has a satin finish rather than a glossy finish. The sound is good and definitely much deeper than the tenor uke, which makes it sound more like a guitar, though it a little smaller than a 3/4-size guitar. It was easy to pickup since I was already playing the tenor uke (about a fifth difference in tuning), though it is easy to confuse the fingering after I play the tenor. So, now I play both regularly at home, and to accompany small groups of singers. In conclusion, I highly recommend this baritone uke for anyone who wants to try one, because it sounds very much like a guitar, but is easier to learn, play, and transport."
3,Ehh... good for beginner,"well, its OK... its just a cheap uke, and made in china... so the sound quality isnt that great, i have a soprano that is louder... but its okay for a first ukulele. the strings came out of order and if you dont know which ones go where, your kinda skrewed... easy to scratch or mess up... chord dots came off on the neck, and i noticed when they came off they were just cheap stickers (like the ones you get from the dentist or doctor) the strings they give you SUCK... i played it everyday for a week for about 30 minutes and the metal turned copper color and one string was coming undone (metal was coming off) and almost snapped on me... so, if you buy this, i wouldnt buy this uke today if i had a choice, buy a different uke"
4,Surprisingly good program,"I bought this product to do a review, and I was pleasantly surprised. The cursor problem can be quickly fixed by calling the support number, and once you reference the instruction book (which doubles as the cd cover), everything is pretty self explanatory. I do not support the previous review--the mixing screen allows you to develop ANY kind of makeup shades you want. With an hour or two of playing with it, it worked quite smoothly. However, because the buttons are pictures and there are no words on the program, be sure to reference the instructions. Have fun!"
4,VERY COOL,"Well when I saw it on the computer I fell in love with ""Barbie Digital Makeover"" I bought it right away. It is the best game ever.I play with it when friends come over. They think it's so much fun. Some people get disapointed because you get 2 chins but that's just a part of the Fun!!!You should see the makeover I give to my pets.""Barbie Boutique"" is one of it's main competitors but still ""Barbie Boutique"" CANNOT make makeovers for yourself. I think that since the mattel company improved over the last couple of years they should make a ""Barbie Digital Makeover 2"" It would be an entertainment to the whole family (including dads and brothers) for months. In conclusion buy this game and you and your child will be happy forever because if your childs happy your happy."
3,Another Bee Trauma...,"I think I first saw this movie on the Disney channel years ago. The one thing that's always stuck with me is the image of the windmill perched on top of the Parker's car, shearing trees and slamming into signs...Watching it now, I can't help but think what a little more production money and script tightening would have done for this picture. The dog going missing is a waste of time. The summer job is okay, but the best part is when they're on the road.Now, here's why I'll always love it. The bee in the car! Dorothy Lyman's hysterical reaction is worth the fifty dollar purchase price you'll probably have to pay to get your hands on this one.And for fun, watch when the Parkers are chasing the Rolls Royce...especially after the car turns around. What's that, a Nova? And a Chevette? I thought this was a 40s-50s movie!"
2,Disappointed,"I read all the other reviews on Amazon before I purchased this movie. I was anxious to see it because I love ""The Christmas Story"" so much, that I figured its sequel would be just as great, however, I was very disappointed.The actors (especially the father and mother) couldn't come close to Darrin McGavin and Melinda Dillon's portrayl of the Mother and the Ol' Man. Why weren't their talents used in this film? Ralphy was only okay, and Randy was way too young. If you go along with the first film, the boys weren't that far apart in age.All in all, this film is weak and really doesn't hit the mark like ""The Christmas Story""."
4,Real life enough to be funny!,"Anyone who has gone on a family trip in the car will relate to something in this movie! My kids and I have watched this together many times on cable and want to get our own copy. The one line we always quote while driving past craft stores is, ""we're not getting any junk today!"" Especially when we see windmills by the road! In fact, I bought one just because of that scene. The other line around meal time is, ""I want a peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich!"" with visions of food flying out the window. The family must see this video! Please bring it back so we all can have it for our grandchildren! Its great!"
3,Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss vs A Christmas Story,"This video is comparatable to the Christmas movie ""A Christmas Story"". It is told in third person and anyone who has gone cross country in a car with your family growing up will apprecieate the humor found in this. James Sikking plays a role very opposite of his roll in Hill Street Blues. My family and I enjoyed this video very much."
5,Funny,I saw this movie on PBS years ago and wanted to show it to my children. They loved it. It is so funny.
1,The Other Side of the Looking Glass,"While the book starts out as interesting reading, drawing you into a world of paranormal at one point the author just stumbles, and goes from intrique into self pity. Who cares about her lovers, and all the detail she somehow manges to pull thru the web, she lost it and just never picks up the tempo again.Sorry, this is not worth reading!"
3,"A strange, but memorable novel.","A lullaby. A cute song sung to children. How does this innocent song kill? This question haunts reporter Carl Streator as he investigates the sudden surge of infant deaths across the country. What Carl finds is that unknowing parents are singing a culling song to their children resulting in the child's death.Desperate to stop the spread of the poem, Carl travels the country only to be faced with unimaginable choices in his race to prevent disaster.`Lullaby' is a strange, funny, scary, and totally surprising novel, one that could only come from the twisted mind of Chuck Palahniuk, the visionary author of `Fight Club', and `Choke', and as usual he's as twisted as ever. This novel is not for everyone, but those looking for something unusual, and memorable should dive into it and enjoy.Nick Gonnella"
3,weird,"It's deffinitely not his best book, but it's still not terrible. I am looking forward to reading more of his stuff, hopefully it'll continue to be weird, but better than this one."
5,Not what i expected,"After reading Fight Club, Choke, Invisible Monsters, and Survivor, Lullaby caught me off guard, it didn't strike me as something Chuck would write about;it was out there, like most of his work that i've read is,but best of all, it was an exellent read and definitely up to par with the rest of his works;i can't wait to see the day that he's required reading in schools,his work is far more interesting and makes me think independantly alot more than anything i've ever read before.brilliant"
3,strange...,"Although i enjoyed it,some of the stuff in his books are off the wall! I like his use of terms and his little ""fun facts"". A good read if your a chuck fan...one of his better books. (i've only read three so far)"
3,amazing once again,"Lullaby is amazing, like all his books.Great characters, compelling story, perfect pacing.A must read, pick it up."
5,Palahniuk just keeps getting better.,"Once again Palahniuck proves jsut how good he is.And how good is that? I think that it's safe to saythat he's the best out there today. Nobody is asfearless with their imagination. Nobody tests thierreaders more. With lullaby, Palahniuk is getting prettydamn close to perfection.The only reason I could think of someone not falling for thisbook is...well, for some reason Nash comes to mind."
2,More of the same,"OVer the course of his last three novels, Chuck has become more and more repetitive. His writing has become gimmicky. I wish I had kept the receipt."
1,One of a Kind,"This book holds the distinct privilege of being the only book in my life that upon finishing, I sent through the shredder."
1,WOW!!! REALLY GOOD TIME WASTER!!!,"i read this book pretty fast, mostly because i wanted it to get over with....basically all of lullaby is so stupid, i pretty much gave up that it would ever pick up at the end(then it kinda started to seem like it was going to pick up at the end,but THEN,...NOOO!!!!...it had to go and be all crappy again) i never cared about the any of the characters at all, because they were all so personality-less and i could never tell who was who because they all seemed like one big piece 'o crap boring sorry excuse for a human, that i just wished they would all say the stupid poem thingie to each other so they would all die(or maybe that necrophilliac guy could just shoot them so they could suffer more){?}"
4,Classic Palahniuk,It is a classic Palahniuk. There is no Lullaby to put the search for belonging to rest. If you are reading this then you will like.
5,This is the most amazing book I have ever read.,"I'm not an amateur to Chuck's way of writting, I have read Survivor and Fight Club, which are both amazing books. But I find it incredible how he keeps going better and better every book he writes. Lullaby is sort of a mixture between Fight Club and Survivor. As always in Chuck's books, there are many life morals through out the book, yet this book, it seems there is one in every chapter. After every chapter you read, u have to put the book down, and actually reflect on your own life, you have to think about what he's saying and it automaticly changes you in some major or minor form. At the end of this book, which by the way I finished less than 30 minutes ago, I couldn't speak. I was so blown away by his writting. So if you're a Chuck Palahniuk (Paula-Nick if you're wondering) fan, or you're just starting out, buy this book. If this book doesn't blow you away, then you should not be reading these books."
4,"not his best, but still enjoyable","somebody could give you a few pages out of the book, and from that, you could tell that it's Chuck. It was anjoyable, and his style didn't get redundant or tired. I don't think it was on par with his other books, though. The end was rather weak. For a Chuck fan, it's worth reading. But if you're new to his work, try Choke first, or Survivor. Or even Fight Club."
2,Far From Palahniuk's Best,"I have read all of Chuck Palahniuk's books and thought that Survivor and Choke were his best. This book is very inconsistant and I think it shows the only six weeks of effort that went into writing it. The style and tempo of the writing seem to change in the middle of the book as well. The first half seems as if it were written by someone other than Chuck Palahniuk and about midway he finds the unique voice that defines his style. Part of this style is usually a wild premise that requires a suspension of disblief on the part of the reader, but I found that I could not maintain that suspension of disbelief for much of this story. Also, Palahniuk seems to mock much of the whole new-agey, Wiccan practices while at the same time validating them through the action and storyline. This was the main inconsistancy for me. Some really good and witty writing in many parts, but not enough to keep me going like in much of his previous efforts."
2,This book sucks,"Being a fan of Chuck Palahniuk's previous works I was looking forward to reading this. The problem with this novel is that it is way too farfetched. Culling songs are not only retarded, but unrealistic. As a previous reviewer noted, this would have been great if it was made into a short story."
1,thrown away,"This was the type of book that looks mildly interesting in an airport gift shop. It is the kind you buy, read 2/3 of during a cross country flight, and then decide to ditch because the in-flight magazine crossword puzzle is better. I hope whoever picked it up out of the seat pocket in front of me (where I left it) got more enjoyment out of it. I wouldn't waste my time..."
1,I think Chuck needs a vacation.,"After fight club we all wanted to be a little more schizophrenic, didn't we? I thought this book might help to lead me in that direction- unfortunately I still don't hear any voices.I do enjoy how Mr. Palahntuk's mind works, maybe there were publication deadlines that made this book a literary failure.There were a few suprises, some very visual details that you might not find anywhere else, but the plot execution was terrible. By the end I felt cheated.Don't buy this book."
2,Overrated,"I can understand why Chuck Palahniuk has next thing to a cult following. Chuck's writing will definitely appeal to those who appreciate the offbeat and different. And there are parts of Lullaby that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. There are also great thoughts about subjects like noise. But underneath it all, there's this constant thread of I'm-more-clever-than-you. Sometimes it feels like writer's snobbery, and sometimes it's more of an Aren't-I-Simply-Too-Precocious-For-Words thing. I'll admit it. Palahniuk is certainly clever, but I don't think anyone will ever appreciate that nearly so much as he does. Besides that, the ending to Lullaby was just a mess. Blood and guts and unconnected fragments that simply did not make for very good reading.I have other books of Palahniuk's, and at some point I will get around to reading them. But I won't hurry."
2,Oddly mundane,"Although I must give credit to Palahniuk for such an interesting plotline, the characters were undeveloped and known in only a superficial sense. I felt that with such an ingenious plot, the story would have been much more thrilling and less repetitive than it was. The ending of this novel was very incomplete and made the reader wonder what the last 250 pages were for. The whole search, the whole mission, the whole reason for the book seemed lost in the unclimatic ending. There was a great feeling of unaccomplishment at the end."
2,"Solid Idea, Ridiculous Plot","I admire Palahniuk because he picks ingenious material to write about. This book seems to indicate that Palahniuk had a great IDEA, but lacked the methods through which to develop a good plot. I was completely fascinated at the beginning, but quickly lost interest when the plot became ridiculous and weak. I don't think he spent enough time expounding on this great idea and spent too much time expounding on characters that didn't contribute to the immense capability of the idea."
2,Overrated,"If average rating for Survivor is 4 and a 1/2 stars, then Lullaby deserves 2 stars. Survivor, Choke, Invissible Monsters you can read over and over again, I cannot say the same for Lullaby. Being a big Chuck Palahniuk fan I am dissappointed, and with tears in my eyes I am giving Lullaby no more than 2 stars because that is what it`s worth. My therapist agrees and I just finished step seven."
5,never judge a book...........,"okay, I'll be honest. I was at Costco once and I spotted a book with a dead bird on the cover. I was broke and left and tried to forget about it, but a week later I found myself wanting it more than anything in the world, but still having no idea as to its title, author, or even loose premise; I knew nothing but the cover.So I went back, scoured the book section, found it, and bought it immediately.And you know what?This book is damn good."
2,Weird stuff,"This book was too bizarre for my tastes. It was somewhat entertaining, but seemed thrown together. The plot was difficult to follow in some places, with random stuff interspersed in there. However, it was much better than Glamorama, the worst book I have read this year."
2,Rather pointless,"This book had me going for quite a while, and then let me completely down at the end. I just don't get it. Not much point to it. Utterly forgettable.Don't waste your time."
3,Not entirely what I expected,"While I do feel like this book was well written, it left me feeling a bit cheated. I wanted to be a little more scared, a little more surprised and shocked by plot twists. It may have been that I expected to much out of my first Palahniuk novel, but frankly, I was disappointed.I felt that Lullabye lacked in plot and focused too much on social and political commentary. It was a quick and fairly easy read, keeping me entertained enough to finish in 2 days but I kept waiting for something more to happen...and then the book ended.I enjoyed his style and will most likely try another one of his novels, but if your new to Palahniuk, don't read this first."
4,"Not a survivor, but definetly worth listening to","Lullaby definetly has the ambience of Palahniuk's earlier works. It contains the dark satiric style rarely seen in contemporary fiction these days and is filled with pitch black comdey and his venting towards the rituals of life. I love the premise of the story and the characters surrounding it (yes, even Oyster), But I thought the plot went to an unimaginable tangent halfway in. It's a great idea, but the follow through was not ""Survivor -esque"" If you love Palahniuk's work, I don't have to tell you to read it for you to read it. For the rest, read it with an open mind and earplugs..."
1,Unpleased,"Chuck Palahniuk was highly recommended to me by several of my friends, however, I did not enjoy his writing. The storyline in Lullaby was interesting enough, but it was strung together by poorly written sentences that did not flow together well. I would stop reading for days at a time, when usually I can finish a book in 2-3 days. I was not pleased with this book, however, it is on the top of some of my friends lists. To each his own."
3,Okay book.,"I read this book over the summer, and it was okay. It was nothing spectacular, and the author really doesn't offer any special style of writing that seperates him from the rest. It has an interesting theme that will make you think, though. The book is kind of disturbing, especially at the end.So in conclusion, it is an okay book, that other than the theme, isn't special from anything else. The story and the synonpsis on the back of the book make it sound more riveting and exciting than it actually is."
1,Not My Cup Of Tea,"I purchased the unabridged audio version of this book, and am struggling to finish listening to it - I could not imagine trying to finish READING this book. My first and last from this author, the audio version was very tiresome, very repetitive. I found the characters very superficial, and frankly, the entire story very under-developed. After 4 of 5 cassettes, I'm still wondering what the book is about. In one scene, Mona is 'digging' pieces of a model doll house out of Carl's foot. Excuse me? Maybe I'm just dense, but who exactly would crush something with their foot, then walk around with the object still in their foot, till it became infected? Not one of the characters we are supposed to believe in in this novel - not someone with supposed intelligence at least. Very disappointed, as I've heard good things about the author."
1,Terrible,"And I mean terrible. Really bad. Surprisingly, it reads like an After School special from the 80s. It's almost like a computer wrote this.Pure drivel."
1,What the????,"This was the first book I had read by Chuck Palahniuk... and sadly, it might be my last. I started reading this book about four different times in the last two years, and FINALLY sat down and rerereread it. Ughh... why did I do such a thing? Lullaby has some interesting points, some visually entertaining moments, but as a cohesive story- my god, it's irritating! Nothing ""really"" develops, it goes from slightly believable and lifelike, to really bizarre and annoying. There are changes in narration that make it hard to follow at times, which only adds to the ""ughhhh"" factor. You could see how if a hundred pages shorter, it might make a good story, but at 260 pages, it just gets frustrating."
5,Excellent!,"One of my favorite Chuck Palahniuk books, about a ""culling song--"" a poem that mysteriously kills people after they hear it. (I guess it was before that movie ""The Ring"" came out, but kind of the same concept--except you don't get seven days!!)Anyway, in true Chuck Palahniuk fashion, this book is excellent, weaving all sorts of characters together in a sick, twisted, lovely little tale."
2,Clever but overemphasized,"Power is the original corrupter, redemption is not free. Get used to these themes. They will be hammered into your head. The concept and plot development in this book are objectively great, but the constant self-commentary and thematic hammering are really annoying. It's a quick read, and fairly compelling, but unless you're looking for a cheap substitute for a graduate course in ethics, it's not going to be a favorite. My suggestion, read it anyway..."
5,"if this book were an amp, it would go up to eleven.","this is the best book i've ever read, hands down. it's made the most impact on me, in that i think about it nearly every day. ever been stuck in traffic and some total a-hole cuts you off and you just think, without giving any serious thought to the weight of your words, that the person would just die? well imagine every time you thought that, your wish was granted. it becomes very clear how annoyed we all are with each other, and how annoying we have all become as a society. Palahniuk's ability to extrapolate the consequences of one single poem being read is amazing. he has a whole world inside his head that is a stark contrast, yet frighteningly similar to the one we all live in. palahniuk's take on the media fascinates me in particular as someone who has worked at a newspaper since the age of 16 and became disgusted with the business shortly thereafter."
3,Not good enough,"I don't know what made me pick this book of the shelf, but I was not expecting what I got having not seen fight club. I liked his style of writing before he started rabbling on about something...I always thought to be published your story had to start and finish always making sense, no 100 pages of garb randomly placed sences and such.But if you like social commentary, wierds characters that you will remember, and no plot.(even though the ending somehow worked)"
4,First Palahniuk Read,"I have never read anything by Chuck Palahniuk before reading ""Lullaby."" The reason I purchased the book was to meet a girl...Cheesy but true. She told me she was really into his works so I bought this one because of the reviews on Amazon.Not really knowing what to expect I was skeptical at first. But I read the book in two days. I really love the satire in this work. It is dark at times but I really enjoyed the read. I would suggest this book to anyone looking for something interesting and fresh.I got a few more books by this author and can't wait to see what the characters go through."
4,Creepy story stays with you after you put the book down,"This story by Chuck Palahnuik stays with you long after you put the book down. The premise is creepy--SIDS and other unexplained deaths are ""explained"" by the reading, thinking, or reciting of an ancient African culling song included in a book of children's nursery rhymes from around the world.Fortunately, the actually culling song is not included, so while the story will captivate you, and the idea freak you out, the song isn't there to send you over the edge."
4,I would rather rate this one 4.5 stars...,"First of all, I am so happy to have discovered Palahniuk! This was the first time in a long time that I picked up a book and literally did not want to put it down, and for that, this novel gets 4.5 out of 5 stars.The main thing that I enjoyed about this book was that it kept me guessing. Even when I finally thought I had figured everything out, Palahniuk through in a twist that made me second-guess myself...can't beat that! Also, it kept me thinking, even about things he only mentioned in passing, and again, it has been a long time since I've picked up a book that could do that for me. Finally, I truly enjoyed Palahniuk's writing style--he writes like people think, a bit disjointed but easy to understand.All in all, this was a quick read. If you're squeamish I probably wouldn't be so inclined to highly suggest it, hence the 4.5 stars (instead of 5), but otherwise, this is one of the best books I've read in a very, very long time!"
4,Unexpected dark humor... how can you resist?,"This my first time reading Palahniuk. To say that he's unique is an understatement. ""Lullaby"" starts with normal characters but rapidly unfolds into the strangest world imaginable. The pages turn quickly to build a unique place with strange events. Dark humor seeps unexpectedly from aberrant places. The reality presented becomes distorted and twisted, molded into a strange, mystical actuality. At times, as other reviewers mentioned, I felt that I was not be getting the full dramatic effect out of my reading, as if I couldn't grasp what was occurring. Although, by completion, the novel spoke to me with a depth and intensity I have not experienced before. For those who have read the Amazon review, I agree that Chuck Palahniuk expresses potent themes on human control and nature through ""Lullaby"". I recommend this novel to those seeking impact and an ending you will reflect on.Thank you for reading,C.K."
4,Great Read,"I loved this book, and couldn't put it down once I started. Interesting book that rips into the ""new age"" philosophies that have run rampant in the last decade and exposes those who espouse them for what they basically are: people looking for more power. At least that's what I got from it. Like his other books, it peers deeply into our modern psyches without getting too serious. Pick it up and read it, its good for you."
4,"interesting, and well worth reading","Although lullaby is far from Palahniuk's best novel, it is a delightfully clever look at society from a character easy to relate to. It doesn't flow as well as Chuck's other novels, but is still full of twists, and the dark comedic element makes this book a fun read. I recomend this book to both new and old Palahniuk readers."
3,Witty and Fun,"With the film version of Fight Club as my only introduction to Chuck Palahniuk's work before reading Lullaby, this novel was not what I expected. The drawback is that by three quarters through the book, I knew exactly what to expect. The twist is so heavily forshadowed in no indirect terms that Palahniuk might as well announce it on the book jacket.That being said, this was, overall, a very enjoyable read to knock out in a day or two. I love the way Palahniuk can portray a young idealist as more dispicable than a necropheliac; that, alone, takes talent. I also appreciate the physical descriptions of characters throughout the book. In describing the color of a shirt, Palahniuk can illustrate quite a bit about a character's personality.If you are looking for something entertaining to read and already know you have a stomach for Palahniuk's writing style, then give Lullaby a try. Just don't expect the suprise factor you found at the end of Fight Club."
3,3.50 stars,"well, hes always good and this is no differant. this one just wasnt my favorite.Starts out great, but towards the middle, it turned into another story and became a little weird and confusing.A reporter begins researching the deaths of babies, whose parents all have mysteriously sung them a lullaby (culling song) from the same book........thats how it begins.that ISNT how it ends.a good read but very strangehe is very ""readale"" and keeps your attention,butthis wasnt his best workeven though it was good"
2,simple and stupid,"A rainmaker, for sure. isn't it ironic Tyler Dyrden in real life would hate Brad Pitt AND Chuck Palahniuk?"
2,LESS IS MORE,"Cold; you can't empathise with the charactersHeavy handed: Too much repetition. Many themes, theories are explained rather than left to be figure out.Plot confusion: The interludes of phenomenal occurences, Carl doesn't kill Oyster--Why?Pitch black: Pessimistic, unfunny, too downerish.Summary: BIg and MOre doesn't always work: Too much happening, clumsily huge."
2,"Trite, forgettable and boring in the guise of profundity","If you liked Survivor, Fight Club, and Choke, just savor the feeling of a good re-read. Those books were terrific, but this is trendy rehash--in fact, it's sloppily written, just POOR. And I'm sorry--I really WANTED it to be great, as I'd looked forward to it for months. But not this time. Palahniuk is just repeating himself now, and it's sad, really, what his work is becoming."
2,Not his best work...,"I very much liked ""Choke"" and ""Fight Club"", as I enjoy Palahniuk's gritty, hardnosed masculinity and the obscurity of his storylines. Unfortunately, ""Lullaby"" failed to compel me. While the nucleus of the story was intriguing, the character and plot development were weak and left me feeling unaffected and bored."
5,The best of chuck,One of the best told stories I've read. I love all his books and this stands out as my favorite. It is one that I recommend to all my friends and one that I will read again. A very unique plot that I've never seen in any way in any other book or movie.
4,good stuff,"It was an enjoyable book. This is the first of his I have read, since then I have read 3 others. I did enjoy this. As his others, it was kind of strange. But the idea was kind of creepy and neat."
3,for superstitious freaks,Had a tough time with this one. Not UN-enjoyable... Not UN-interesting... But at the same time not exactly grab-you-by-the-scrotum interesting in the same way that Choke or Diary or (heaven forbid) Fight Club was.
3,Fabulous start that went off track,"I have to admit that this book I bought because of the reviews printed on its jacket. I rarely buy books this way. I read the first chapter and was so excited to continue but the story failed to deliver on its promise from the beginning. The whole plot of re-selling haunted houses and having the secretary check out new listings for vibes seemed very original but never went anywhere. At the point where Carl builds miniture doll houses I thought, Good! here's a great opportunity to tie the Helen and Carl characters together mystically - but that never happened. All the creative juices from the beginning wore out and the book became a repetitive rant on our culture, adn the plot became a boring road trip. I was disappointed."
4,It was good but...,"I just finished this book today, and I have to admit I had about a 5 month hiatus right in the middle because I lost the book and once I started reading it again I was a little lost at first but I was able to figure out what was going on again after a couple chapters. I really like the plot premise and the charcters I found them to be pretty facinating, however I felt like the road trip aspect of the book was drawn out too much. I started getting bored and I just wanted it to end until I got to the last few chapters which were really good and kind of made me like the book a whole lot more. Overall it's a good read i probably need to reread it to gain a better insight to the story as a whole."
5,Nasty Fun!,"This is the third Kisner novel I've read ... and by far the best. I hated to put this one down. The main character is a sassy female security guard who spends the midnight shift in a downtown Indianapolis office building with creepy-crawly monsters with a penchant for sex. I laughed so much I still have to hold my intestines in with considerable effort. I highly suggest ""Tower of Evil"" for anyone with a healthy sense of dark humor, but beware the sex (mostly mean) is graphic. Other books of his worth reading are ""Slice of Life"" and ""Earthblood"" or you could try ""Bad Blood"" and ""The Battle for Barnstable"" by Alan Brooker or the ""Blood High"" series by Darrell Lane (all in the same vein as ""Tower of Evil"")."
1,Almost as bad as Neanderthal,"If ever a book was going to take the title ""Worst novel I have ever read"" away from the awful 'Neanderthal', this one had a shot, but alas, it's probably only the second worst novel I've ever dragged through."
4,cute pops,used for a baby showercute popswhy are so many words required to answer this section of this block
2,TKD,Still trying to figure out where they came from. I've never seen these before and I did both WTF and ITF Taekwondo
4,A real treat!,"I've enjoyed getting on the rowing machine at the gym; and day dream, if I were lucky enough to be one of those collegiate scullers; well, here is an interesting perspective on this sport; and just like ol' time American cycling with Major Taylor at the turn of the century; this movie shows, before full acceptance of American football; basketball etcetera, other sports were vying for the main stage of America's attention in the sports arena. I am not aware of the exact time frame but it is clearly from around some time back then, maybe the ""Great White Hope"" was from around the same era as well.In some ways, maybe it does follow a sports movie format; underdog overcoming the odds like in Hoosiers or Rocky; but the sport is unique. Maybe if I were Canadian I'd give it 5 stars, 4 stars still shows it is a good movie; a real gem in fact."
3,Seen this,I've collected most of the documentaries from WWII on DVD that are stored at the National Archive. There's really nothing here that's new and the blu-ray transfer doesn't really make these stand out enough to recommend the purchase of this set when the upconverted DVD of the same material appears to be of the same quality for a lot less.
3,Great,Presentation is ok but comparing it to world at war.. could nt hold a candle.. The latter is very mch superior in terms of presentation and footages
1,dissapointing,"Quality is good, the content is 99% garbage. Few WWII propaganda movies with scripted sequences and I'm talking old BW Godzilla movie style animation. Over all information value of this material is close to ZERO. ...it was a big big disappointment. If you looking for a historic documentary of WWII do NOT buy this."
1,Not Worth Buying,"Cheap poorly made production, razor sharp 1080p????, it seems that the makers of this dvd set have never seen real HD images,HD MASTER AUDIO is a fake and does not pass through on the oppo BDP93 and Onkyo 875, Only able to obtain stereo. If you want to watch proper world war 2 in HD with master audio, buy Apocalypse in Bluray, it is proper hd image in widescreen 16:9 too, unlike this 4:3 letterbox cheap production, disks are made of cheap thin material, you can see right through them against the light."
3,Needs Re-Release,"This is okay. Everything that's already on it can stay, but it needs to be re-released to include the YYH Movie 2: Poltergeist Report using the original English Dub actors as well as the English character dubbing for the songs/videos on Disk 2. If these were included, this would be gold."
3,Not the best thing I bought...,"I found it good for the overall geek needing to complete the collection deal but for actual quality, the dub voices where out on a hike. Sabat sounded like he just finished a DBZ ep. Cook and Burgmeier were the only two I found sounded like the original dubbing of the series. For the price, it should have been $20 for the lack of minutes overall."
2,ok,I realy just got this for the minnie movie. Witch was pretty funny. Just make sure you watch it subbed.
5,DOES NOT INCLUDE POLTERGEIST REPORT,"Reviews stating otherwise are either misguided or blatant lies.Review:This set is awesome. Tons of extras, in original Japanese, from all over the series.Great addition to any fan, I love mine! Just, don't think it comes with the feature length film. It doesn't. Just the ""trailer"" episode ""movie."" :)"
3,Not bad,"I don't know if it's my DVD player or the product, but it started hiccuping during part of the DVD. I only had one player at the time and completely forgot to check at a later time to see if it still had a problem (I'm leaning towards my disc player, though as other DVDs are having the same problem)."
5,grease strainer,[[ASIN:B000MVTIOQ Stanco Metal #GS-1200 Grease Strainer Cup/Lid]]product was as advertised and was delivered in a timely fashion and in excellent condition.
3,"Nice but the lid doesn't fit well,,,update,,,didn't last long","Item showed up promptly and in good shape. It's exactly what I was looking for, the lid could fit a little tighter. Pay close attention to the dimensions. It's a little fatter; 5 1/2"" across and shorter 3/1/4"" high than I'd hoped. takes floor space in the fridge. update*****I've had this product for a little over a year and had to throw it away due to a hole in the bottom."
1,The can leaks,"I pour grease in the can and it ends up all over my counter top. That's not good, is it?"
3,Not ideal for saving bacon fat,"I like to keep a grease strainer for saving bacon drippings. It sits in the back of the fridge and I can scoop some bacon fat out to cook with whenever I need. This strainer, however, is not really ideal for that. Okay, it works, but the one I have now has a more easy-to-remove strainer insert. Which is important, when the grease is cold and solid. Plus it has a hinged lid, whereas this one comes off. Pretty minor, but I wasn't crazy about this one for keeping in my fridge. This is probably best used as something under the sink to keep grease that you intend to throw away."
5,Grease Container,I looked everywhere for one of these - similar to the one my mother has had for years. It looks nice - and a much neater way to store bacon grease.
1,horrible,"I ordered this product b/c a friend suggested it. Little did I know it was made of cheap metal. Recieved dented and paint chipped, they gladly sent me a new one, but I recieved the same problem. I just got my money back b/c I had enough w/ a cheap looking product."
2,Came Dented and Too Large,"Item came dented, and it was much larger than I expected. Typically our grease jars are no larger than a coffee cup, but this was bigger than a cottage cheese tin. Feels like it is made of cheap plastic, and obviously not of good quality. I'd avoid this product."
5,Just like the old days,"This is the product that I was looking for in local stores. A lot of places sell fancier ones, bigger ones, etc.; however, I wanted one like I had 40 years ago and this is it. All aluminum and just the right size."
1,Poorly made,"I've owned two of these strainers, and both developed multiple holes in the bottom within a year. I won't waste my money on another one. The metal is very thin."
3,grease container,"the product was ok for my needs. product arrived on time was not damaged,since useing it i found that maybe handles on it would be better"
3,Damaged Item Recieved,"I read all the reviews before placing the order on this item and the only thing that stood out was it's being damaged when received. So playing the odds I went ahead and placed my order. Today I received my Grease Strainer and it was also damaged. However, I can't place the blame on the structure of the item but do so on the packaging.On initial review, it looked to be packed well with balloon type packaging material. It was on the top and side, however the damage was to the bottom. The box itself was flimsy and I could see where it looked to have been punctured through, causing a slight dent to the bottom of the pan.The damage being minimal and on the bottom, I don't see it stopping the product from doing it's job nor taking away from the looks, so I'm keeping it. But will probably not be placing any further orders till packaging is modified."
1,Grease Can Review,I was disappointed with this product. The grease can I received was not black -- it is gray and clashes with my black kitchen appliances. Also this grease can is very thin and flimsy -- not sturdy at all. For a grease can -- it should be made with heavier material. I would not purchase this item again. I'm looking for another grease can to purchase.
2,CHEAPLY MADE BUT WILL WORK,"LIGHT TIN. NOT WORTH THE MONEY - MAYBE AT 1/2 PRICE. DISAPPOINTED, DON'T BOTHER - BUY A FOILED LINED BAG FOR CAMPING - MUCH BETTER."
2,keep looking,"There are several problems with this product. First of all there is a short in the wiring. The on/off switch is one of those knobs that you twist and there is a short so it doesn't always work. Also too I saw other reviews that said there hair get caught between the plates and the plastic, and it is true. I lose alot of hair everytime I use it."
5,Great experience!,The straightener was in excellent shape (just as advertised) and arrived extremely quickly. Definitely recommend!
1,wrong product,the product that i received is not the same as the product shown. The one i received is much cheaper and i am not pleased! i have used the Hot tools straightener model 3199 which is shown in the picture but it is not what i received.
4,works well,"I bought this after my cheap conair straightener wouldn't heat up any longer, this was a new brand for me and a new design. it straightens my hair the best of any straightener i ever had (and I've gone through a bunch). though i do agree with everyone who is saying it pulls their hair, it seems if you grab too much hair and put in the inner most area of the straightener that it tugs at your hair and can pull some strands out. I've learned to prevent that but it annoying. although i love this straightener, I'll be looking into a new one in a few months."
3,Not as good as a CHI,"I purchased this iron at Ulta and although it straightens my hair it does not give it that salon look. If you are looking to just get by between salon visits this iron is fine, if not get the CHI."
1,Haven't heard back from seller regarding return instructions/label!,This seller is not selling quality products. Received a flat iron with bad cord. And the power switch is not the same as pictured or what the original product has from Hot Tools. I'm still waiting for return label.
2,cheap,this product sucks! i dont have have really curly hair or anything but it doesnt straighten well mostly it just frys ur hair eve if its not that hot and the plates dont close all the way.
4,Does the job,"Previously I had a ""wet-to-style"" flat iron and cringed every time I heard it sizzle my hair and always wanted a nice flat iron that would straighten my hair on the first time through and save me time. I guess I thought this flat iron was supposed to be a lot better so in that sense I'm a little disappointed. It does warm up really fast and allows you to set the temperature of the flat iron which I thought was really nice. It's a little different than my old one so I'm still trying to get used to it but I would say it takes about the same amount of time to straighten my hair as with my old flat iron - yet again I can be really fussy about my hair."
3,Average,The picture of the iron is different than what is sent. They must not make the iron with that kind of handle anymore as I have ordered from other companies also.
3,hot iron,"The flat iron works fairly good, it just alittle big and hard to handle. It gets very hot and you have to be careful where you hold it."
2,Pulls your hair!,"While I don't have this EXACT model, I have one very similar that is made by the same brand. It heats up quickly and can straighten the curliest of curls; however, where the ceramic plate joins the plastic holder there is a little gap. This gap always catches my hair as I'm pulling it through. It hurts and does a lot of damage. I paid over $100 for my model, so more money doesn't always mean a better product."
2,It hurts!,"I dont personally own this item, but have used it before. My cousin has it and I sometimes iron my hair with it. It works well and gets the job done, however my hair always gets caught in it and almost always I cant get it out without having to rip my hair apart. You have to be very careful when putting hair between the plates. Also, I dont like the design of the handle. It gets tiring after awhile to press down on them. Also, often what happens is that the handles lock when pressing down, it gets really annoying. Good product for straightening hair but too many flaws in the design."
3,"Good price, works but hair just keeps getting caught in the handle.","This iron is perfect if you want to straighten your hair at a lower temperatures. I noticed that the more costlier flat irons get pretty hot to where it could be damaging. This iron works pretty well in terms of temperature control, but for some reason my hair keeps getting caught in the clamping part. Using this device requires you to pay extra extra attention and time to keep from your hair getting caught. Otherwise, it's a good price and it does its job."
3,Straightner,"This straightner does get hot fast and straightnes my hair nice. However, my hair gets stuck at the end of the straightner and puts my hair out. This straighter would be good for people with medium length hair."
4,great iron for the price,I am very happy with this. it shipped fast and I saved about $30. I can finally style my bangs. Love Hot Tools Brand.
1,JUNK,I would NEVER recommend this item to anyone. I have had it for approximately 2 months and it no longer works. JUNK JUNK JUNK!
1,HOT TOOLS MISSES THE MARK WITH THIS IRON,"After years of being a loyal to Hot Tools, it was time to replace my flatiron and decided to upgrade from the 1190 to the 1199 ceramic flat iron, I was quickly disappointed when at first use a chunk of hair was yanked out of my head. There is a major design flaw; the seams where the hot plate meets the plastic, there is just enough spacing for strands of hair to get caught. It is unfortunate since I did spend good money on this and to choose between spending more to replace it or keep using it at the cost of pain to my little head..."
3,Its not bad,"This flat iron works pretty good, I have really thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this iron did the trick for the most part. My only complaint is that because the ceramic plates are flush to the handle my hair would get caught between the plates and the handle, which would result in a lot of painfully pulled out hair."
1,I Want My Money Back!,"This tool has two design flaws. One is where the two clamps come together near the handle. Your hair gets caught in there and you are forced to pull it out leaving clumps of hair in the tool. The second flaw is the clip on the handle (to hang it?): it falls back and forward, getting in the way of the handle release. I finally tied mine down with a twisty. I'm in the market for a different flat iron and this was a big waste of money. Don't think twice...move on."
5,Flat Iron by Hot Tools,Probably one of the best flat iron products on the market for under $50. I think I paid around $25 for it. Great on coarse hair and saves time.
4,It's pretty good...,"This iron works pretty well, the only problem is that it snags your hair at the ends, I guess your hair gets caught between the ceramic and the plastic...The temperature of this iron gets pretty high, so that's good for straightening...I think it's a pretty good iron..."
3,Hot tools straightener,Fast shipping. Product is satisfactory since the model I wanted to order is no longer available!
1,WISH THEY HAD A ZERO STAR FOR RATING....,"DON'T BUY THIS - IT ***TOTALLY** PULLS YOUR HAIR BETWEEN THE PLATES (IT RIPPED OUT LOTS OF MY DAUGHTER'S HAIR AND MADE HER CRY - SHE'S 13!) AND THE HANDLE GETS STUCK IN THE LITTLE ""HANGING"" RING.... I RETURNED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM."
1,Please do not buy,"I bought this product from Trade Secret store in Detroit, Michigan. Only used twice and my hair burned. Complained to store and they said they cannot do anything. Stuck with $80 dollar tool. I do not recommend anyone to buy it."
2,"After only 2 months, the ceramic is chipping.","This iron works fine and I really liked it for a while. But just this past week I really that the purple ceramic is chipping.It has a 1 year warranty but I've tried to find the company's website, to no avail."
2,Wrist hurts when using this item.,"I bought this item after using another Hot Tools flat iron for many years. I loved that product and wanted the exact same, which is what I thought I had here, since it's the same product number. Not so. this product is designed differently with a completely different dial for the temp, and the handle is also different. The first one I had made straightening easy, while this new one is HORRIBLE. I actually have to take a rest half way through using it because my wrist starts to hurt so much. I don't know what it is that they've done differently but I am extremely disappointed and wish I hadn't bought this now."
5,Great product,"Works beautifully! Gets hot enough to really control course or stubborn hair on the first try. No going over and over the same piece of hair! Hair doesn't get damaged, easy tool to hold, and contrary to some of the other reviewer, I have no trouble with hair getting caught in the plates. My first one was still working beautifully after a year, so I gave it to my daughter (who was constantly borrowing it) and bought another one for myself."
3,Decent priced ceramic flat iron,"I have been using this flat iron for almost a year and have liked it for the most part. It gets very hot and keeps it's heat fairly well. The adjustable temp is nice, too. The rounded edges are perfect for hair styles that flip up or under without having to use the curling iron as well. I could only give it three stars instead of four because my hair gets caught in the edge where the iron meets the plastic housing. This is a common problem with this brand from what my stylist says. It could be more prone with my type of hair...long and wavy/coarse. However, if you want a good ceramic flat iron at a decent price, this is a good choice."
3,Good but BE CAREFUL,This iron straightens the hair great as the other reviews have said but be careful you don't use large sections of hair...the hair gets caught easily. I try to do small sections but when I get impatient my hair gets caught a lot...I have more broken-off hairs now that I ever have in my life. I am currently looking for a replacement.
4,Easy and Fast,This flat iron works great & heats fast. My only complaint would be every now and then while using it my and my daughters hair will catch in something and it pulls and kinda hurts.
2,dissapointing,"the very first time i used this the purple coaring started to chip off, i mean it still worked and i have pretty intence long curly thick frizzy hair, but i really dont want my hair burnt any more than it has to be, i had the 2"" professional ceramic flat iron from the same company and never had any issues with it for about a year, untill it got stepped on and broke."
4,Worth more than what I payed for it,I ordered this iron and I wasn't sure how well it would work but to my surprise it worked better than I expected. This iron proved to me that you don't have to spend a lot of money to get a great straightening iron.I highly recommend this product!
3,a few decent-sounding tracks,"the rest are drab-sounding monophonic filler for miller completists. the sound quality of the stereo selections is a revelation, why couldn't all music of the period have been recorded with this multitrack optical recorder technology?"
3,An expensive guidebook,"The book sticks to its dates with the focus on the Secessionist architects of the turn of the century. It provides thumbnail photographs and short descriptions of 100 buildings, along with their locations in Vienna. It is a bit overpriced for what is essentially a guidebook. There are no plans or detail drawings to add to your understanding of these buildings and the Werkbundsiedlung is briefly described at the end of the book with a handful of photos but no map of the layout of the housing project built in the early 1930's. It is fine if you are heading to Vienna and want to look these buildings up, but if you are interested in a more in-depth survey of the Vienna Secession or the later Modern buildings then I would suggest to look elsewhere."
1,Buyer Beware: Terrible CD - en calidad pobre (poor quality),"Soy buen aficionado de Willy Chirino. Sus CDs 'Son del Alma' y 'Cuba Libre' son los mejores CDs que hay, pero este 'Mis Primeros Exitos' por Willie Chirino (en ves de Willy Chirino)es de pobre calidad. Los vocales son tan horible que no creo que puede ser el mismo Willie Chirino. La calidad es como algo hecho en el sotano del fulano. Hay razon que este CD no esta registrado en el website: WillieChirino.com. Fue una perdida de dinero.I am a great fan of Willy Chirino. His CDs 'Son del Alma' & 'Cuba Libre' are the best CDs there are, but this one 'Mis Primeros Exitos' by Willie Chirino (not Willy Chirino) is of poor quality. The vocals are so bad that I cannot believe this person to be Willy Chirino. The CD sounds like something made by kids in the basement. There is obviously a reason that this CD is not listed on the WillieChrino.com website."
1,This book really stinks!,It's only here because so little documentation about this era exists.To look at this one would think the punk movement was started andconfined to Hollywood. Does not even have an index to referencespecific people and bands. Gary Leonard- an excellent photographer-is poorly represented with badly reproduced pictures. At ($) thisis highway robbery.
3,insightful look at a wild time!,"this book is cool, but even better is ""High On Rebellion/Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County, Cherry Vanilla, etc THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
3,not original,"these are just larry williams patterns with a smidgen extra. If you do not know williams stuff this will be good,if you do, you will be let down"
3,"Good, but has more calories than expected","I like the sauce but was disappointed to find that a 2 tablespoon serving has 80 calories. This information is in the description but I didn't notice before buying. If you are more interested in sugar-free rather than low carlorie, you might be happy with this sauce."
3,Very sweet!,"I was glad to find this, because it does not contain sugar alcohols, and finding anything white chocolate and sugar free is difficult. Yes, the taste is extremely sweet. The flavor is really hit-or-miss. It does work okay in tiny amounts on sugar free ice cream. However, the white chocolate flavor is not noticeable in coffee - just the sweetness. It's a good value, though, for those who are looking for sugar-free alternatives. I'm still experimenting with other uses."
1,Torani sugar free syrup,"The service is excellent and I have ordered this product several times - always prompt, correct and delicious. This time, however, with three large (4 lbs) containers to my name - they are sour! Yes! Sour milk sour. They curdle the milk and the mochas are not palatable. I have yet to dump the third, but the first two went down the drain. This is not the norm but certainly makes me wary about ordering again."
3,ok,its not as good as the sugar white chocolate sauce I wont be purchasing it again but its not bad.
2,Why so much trouble with ram?,"Ay laddie, this chip has speed - but it also has a heapful of troubles with ram. I tried no end of types, and most were rejected. Saints be praised, my old 1800mhz p4 took ALL of them without problem.What in the blazes is wrong here?"
1,Athlon 64 not ready for prime time yet,"Athlon 64 is not ready for prime time yet. Without widespread OS and driver support, the true benefit of 64 bit computing is redundant. Try sticking a Ferrari engine inside your Mini Cooper - you just can't make it go faster than the other parts will allow. Its also going to be interesting to see how much support AMD can garner from the software community, will they port their apps for AMD 64. Let me tell you the answer - NO. Until Intel releases a 64 bit processor, you can forget 64 bit becoming mainstream. Till then its all marketing hype and a waste of money. If you want to blow big bucks on your CPU, get the P4P w/ Hyperthreading Extreme Edition."
3,"Good for some, not for budget travel","How to rank this book depends upon what you are looking for. In my case, I've been using Lonely Planet guides for many years and am accustomed to their assistance for traveling on a real budget. This book was different in that it focused much more on the mid-range of travel, and was really lacking on the budget end. For example, it assumes that you will use a tour and tour guide to visit many archeological sites instead of pulling it off using public transportation and your feet. And the least expensive hotels are often not covered.ON THE PLUS SIDE, there are a lot of Americans traveling in Belize and they seem to be largely staying in the nicer hotels and using tours. For them, this book is more than adequate and easily recommended. For those who are really budget travelers, I'd suggest ""The Rough Guide to Belize"", which I ended up borrowing from other travelers."
3,Disappointing,"As always, the Lonely Planet guide is well-structured with key features such as bus schedules. This particular guide was hit-and-miss with its information, however. Lodging prices were out-of-date (not just seasonally); the Tropical Education Center's prices have nearly doubled. The biggest problem is the outright-misinformed notion that Belize's dry season starts in November; every Belizean told me that it always starts in January or February, hence water levels were still high in Crooked Tree and wildlife was scarce during my February trip. Several towns and locations of interest were left out, forcing me to buy the Rough Guide. Although the Rough Guide reads like a novel and not so much a field guide, it has more information than the Lonely Planet guide. This was the first trip where nobody I met was using the LP guide."
2,Out dated,The information in this book is out dated and should not be on the market...there is a new one coming out that you should wait and purchase.
3,Belize ( Country Guide ),"This book was Ok, not as informative as Fodor's guide. It also has very small print that was hard to read even with my strongest reading glasses on. I'd hoped it would be more of a brochure - quick reference guide _ but basically had the same information as Fodor's, just not as complete."
5,Belize Lonely Planet,"Although this particular edition is a little outdated since it was published in 2008, it was extremely helpful during our recent 2-week backpacking trip to Belize."
2,"No color pictures, black and white pictures are not good definition","I bought this book despite mediocre reviews as it was the only Belize book available for the kindle. Although the authors may have assumed most readers would only view the book on their kindle, I tend to do a lot of my reading from my PC. And I am sure I am not alone. Other travel books and several text books I've bought had lovely color pictures -- since it's digitial, why not -- minimal added cost. Otherwise seems to be OK."
1,Never received product from Butler's New Books,"I ordered this book on August 25, 2010. Butler Books charged my account on August 26, 2010. I never received the book. It is now September 28, 2010 and I've written them email twice. They keep saying that they will send a replacement shipment but have not done so. I will never order through them again and highly recommend that you order your books from another vendor!!!!!!"
3,Good info but not exactly what I was looking for,"I grew up in a Gorden-Van Tine house built in 1912 in St. Louis. I was hoping the 1920s catalog might have that house in it. While I saw in the catalog many similarities to particular features in our house (e.g., staircase and bathroom designs), the actual model was not included."
3,Pulsar Watch,"The watch looks good, elegant. The only thing that i dont like about the watch is that the numbers on the dial are proportionately bigger than the dial."
5,A great toy to get!,"My son and I went out and got most of the action figures from Episode III as soon as they were out. Shaak Ti, after we had gotten the Episode II figure, was on our MUST HAVE list. She has so much more articulation than the Ep. II, which had like 3 points of articulation. She has a well made cloth skirt, and can fit in many of the speeders from any of the movies. The only disapointment was that she WAS NOT IN THE MOVIE!!! She is, however, in the deleted scenes! She is a great toy!"
2,Still teaches you to diet...,"Although Jantz writes that ""Diets don't work."", he gives what truly is a diet in day 20. He calls it ""healthy eating"", but there IS a place for a piece of chocolate when you are eating balanced and nutritious meals! He says to get rid of ""guilt"" foods, but recommends that we do this by avoiding them altogether. This denial approach only sets you up for a major food craving, which easily leads to overeating that ""forbidden"" food, and then -- what else? -- GUILT. I recommend Gwen Shamblin's Weigh Down approach, as it more accurately illustrates a Christ-centered life & what our attitude towards food should be."
3,Pettersson Lite,"Vasks is typical of today's ""spiritual minimalists"" - sort of a blend of New Age ""air pudding"" with a very light sprinkle of ""seriousness"". Easy to listen to - you could put this on as background music, or to fall asleep to. And I realize that's what a lot of people seem to be looking for these days. But don't expect any soul-searching, or profundity. Slightly melancholic, wistful, not exactly ""deep"", but at least it isn't Yanni. If you've heard it once, there's not a lot to be mined out of it on repeated listenings.If you'd like a more substantial musical experience, try the symphonies of Allan Pettersson. Start with his 7th."
1,No glow No go tire lights,"I have been HAD and badly so too.......the lights switch off when fitted to the tire and dont work to create the effect claimed....performance no where near the claims made....even if it did work, I would have had to manualy fix and remaove it each time ( it need no be working in daylight, right?) .....meaningless, useless product....."
4,It's Ok...But Great Light!,"Well, First Of It Isn't An Stay On Glow..It Flickers Like If You Were At A Rave...Then It Installs Super Easy But The Whole Turning Them On & Off Is Just Tiring! But When They Are On...It Only Starts Flashing When Your Rims Are Spinning So...Kinda Conserves Energy....But They Really DO GLOW When Your Driving..I Was Driving And I Was Getting Mad Head Turning From Other Peeps...I Can See My Rims Flashing In The Reflection Of Other Peoples Cars!! I Passed A Cop With Them On..He Didn't Mind...But IDK Watch Out! So Yeah There's My Review."
4,"Buy it for track 8, it's worth it!","Just picked this one up today. I was craving some good, deep, chunky house, and saw this in the listening station. Like most house comps these days, they reel you in with a name like Miguel Migs or Kaskade. Don't get me wrong, love both, but it's a bit of a marketing tool I think. Anyway, I was pleased with all the tracks at the store, then popped it into my car as I pulled away. What? Was this the same CD I was just listening to?? The tracks seemed to drag on and on... until I got to number 8. MAN ALIVE, this is SERIOUS, FRESH, FUNKY, and NEW house. Hoo ray to the house gods! In fact, I'm gonna pop it in now as I get ready to go out. GO JOCELYN!!!"
5,Great book!,"Even though this book is meant for kids, I bought it anyway. I'm 16 and I really want to be an animator when I'm older, and surprisingly this book really helped me learn to draw all the Toy Story 1 & 2 characters on my own. The characters are computer-animated in the movie, but this book helps you bring them alive on paper, too. I have all the books in this series and I LOVE them all, they seriously helped my cartooning skills & they're fun to use as well!"
5,Truly exquisite music!,"The alaps are sublime, the dhrupads ecstatic. Overall, the music is truly exquisite. Wasifuddin is the torchbearer of the Dagarvani tradition today!"
2,"Old detailing techniques, no new ideas or shortcuts","Mr. Jacobs apparently has been detailing automobiles for some time. The problem is, his techniques are laborious and time consuming. I have shown concours quality automobiles for many years and am still waiting for a book with fresh new ""Insider"" detail secrets...the wait continues."
2,Cute when standing but rolls around when on its side (while putting on toothpaste),"My 3-year old daughter likes that it's Crayola like her crayons and really loves that there is a suction cup on the bottom that makes it stick to the counter top.I like that it stands up with the suction cup, but the 3-year old needs to put it down on its side when she uses both her hands to squeeze toothpaste onto it. And hence lies the problem...because of the wide, cylindrical handle, the toothbrush rolls around when laying on its side. So she cannot get the toothpaste on it unless I hold the toothbrush for her.The bristles are soft and lasts about a month, used by a preschooler twice daily (not a vigorous brusher).The toothbrush is cute and it lasts about as long as expected...but it's probably better for older kids that only need one hand to squeeze out toothpaste while holding the toothbrush with the other hand."
3,"Nice. Got them as a male, but perhaps a little feminine.","Comfortable, look nice, but after awhile I decided they are definitely made for girls. Especially since I saw one wearing the same pair. Buy accordingly."
2,Color wears off,I highly suspect that this is not sterling silver bc the color changed! It turned into rusty kind of color and became dull looking.This is not right because all of other sterling silver earring remain silver and shining even exposed to humidity (they are all in my bathroom).
1,Not as pictured!!!!,Bought these to replace a pair that look exactly like the product picture... they however do not look like that. They have an extremely plain silver look - no dark antique look between the threads and between the bands. Look at some of the other knot earrings on Amazon - that's what they look like - plain bright silver. Bought these because I thought they were different :(
2,Very small and dull,"I bought these mainly for the backs, and with the hope they would be of high enough quality for my second hole. The backs are great; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking. Buyer beware; I would never wear them out, nor consider them as giftable. The company (Sabrina Silver) was a pleasure to do business with: timely delivery, secure packaging."
2,pretty but not stirdy,"the earrings look exactly the way the picture suggests, but i made the mistake of wearing the earrings to sleep and the knots come apart. they are a day-wear item only. when i buy stud earrings, i want to be able to sleep, work, play, and shower with them in. the antiquing (black stuff) to make the details of the knots look good also bleeds out of the earrings. they are tiny, they are knots, but be careful with them or they will come undone."
5,Very nice earrings!,"These are very nice earrings. I have smaller ears, so they were a bit large for my second hole, but they look fantastic in the bottom hole. It's a cute spin on the basic stud."
5,cas,"Pretty good anime and stays pretty close to the manga series so far, and good price for this collection three dvd. To bad no blu-ray yet."
3,"Too much surprise, not enough suspense","This is not a bad book, but it isn't a great one either. I knew that the obvious suspect wasn't going to be the murderer, however the real murderer was unexpected. I felt that the author didn't give enough information to lead someone to figure out who the murderer was. In fact once I found out who the murderer was, I had to go back through the book to remember the character."
4,Extremely interesting autobiography of this controversial Native American leader.,This autobiography doesn't pull any punches. It tells it all and results in an understanding of the anger which drove Russell Means to do the things he did. Probably suitable for adult reading only.
2,"interesting, exciting, a few drawbacks",This book is hard to put down. There's alot of time spent about his drunken adventures and scuffles with authorities. However you will have to look hard to find his beliefs. At the end is a famous speech from July 1980 which presents his philosophy. Native American struggles are intriguing.But Be warned: RUSSELL MEANS IS A RACIST. Also unfortunate: he is agnostic about Christianity but has not lived his own religion consistently throughout his life.
2,"okay, but not GREAT","The entire time reading this book, I couldn't help but think: Russell Means is doing a good job of marketing Russell Means.Means needs to knock the chip off his shoulder, and quit the 'poor, poor pitiful me' routine. His attitude and outlook as 'victim' just doesn't cut it here.Means has done well for HIMSELF. I don't think he's done much to help 'his people.'PARTS of this book are worth looking into, but whatever you do, DON'T buy the book.Check it out at the public library. And save your cash for something better."
1,Fantasy,"Russell has really gone off the deep end with this self important tripe of a book. His self important fantasy about his life is amusing at best. His actions since the 70's are a joke. Abandoning a Sun Dance at Crow Fair that he was hosting because his hollywood agent called and he left to be in a movie. Back in the early 90's I saw first hand what people think of him, he showed up at a powwow in Porcupine, SD. He showed up riding on the hood of a car waving at everyone, like he was in a parade. All of the elders that were around for the Wounded Knee standoff in 1973, went and sat in their cars until he left. It was about 95 degrees that day. Russell only cares about Russell and his self importance."
4,The pilgrim.,"I did like this book. I read it years ago and it was difficult to put down. Compelling and interesting. But like Kris Kristofferson's ""The pilgrim"", the book is ""partly true and partly fiction"".So take it with a grain of salt an enjoy."
4,A book written with a lot of heart.,"I'm sure Russell wrote this book, looking over his life and times. But there are people out there who knew him as he really was. He left out alot of people who helped him in more ways than one. But he did help the people come out of the woodwork, and to be proud to be Native American, And to stand up for thier rights."
5,No longer our invisible minority!,"Thanks to writters like Russell Means, Vine Deloria Jr., Paula Gunn and Sherman Alexie - just to name a few - American Indians are no longer invisible to the dominant society. This powerful book should be required reading in our country's schools. Hopefully, because of books like this one - that may one day be possible."
3,Good book on Russell Means,"This is a thorough and long book by Russell Means about his life as an American Indian. He has a lot of hatred toward the white race, which is understandable, but it makes his book hard to read at times because his hatred comes through the pages. He is also obviously biased at points, but that is to be expected because it is an autobiography. However, this man has been through a lot and has done a lot for AIM (american indian movement) so this is a good read to find out about that. If you can get past the hatred in this book, it's worth the read."
5,The Truth Is Spoken,"I found the autobiography of Russell Means an awe astonishing point of view that we all could learn from. Even if every person took one thing from the book and embraced it into their life and then passed it onto future generations. I, myself took so much from it and will ever be grateful to Russell for telling the story of AIM and of the Lakota Nation. Being a American Indian raised by a white family and then reading this book has made me even more proud to be Dine' and I can take so many of the values taught and teach them to my children. I greatly admire and respect Russell for his struggle, his love and his pride. It truly inspires and empowers me!!!"
5,Powerful and Great Book,"Russell Means is an amazing guy and has been through so many situations which are mentioned in the book.His book explains his life and how he discovered his true identity - Lakota and how he dealt with the issues that impact his tribal identity.In addition, the book also mentions how his involvement with the movement and other demonstrations which represent his views and why many things that are done by the US are wrong or a flagrant insult to the tribes.I strongly suggest you to read his book to learn how he found his true identity, how he evolved from being indifferent into a big time activist, and what messages we lack to understand about the tribes.Lastly, the book is easy to read and entertaining!"
4,jute,i got this twine to crochet baskets and bowls. they turned out great! this twine was at a great price.
2,Not chip Resistant,I order this Pasta Set. It is beautiful but arrived with a chip. I had to order a replacement. I hope the next set isn't chipped.
4,Off the beaten path,"I was astounded to find this in the used bin at a local record store, and I was thrilled, as both a collector of Christmas music and an afficionado of 80's alternative and electronica, to see artists like Aztec Camera, Cabaret Voltaire and the Durutti Column on this compilation. To be fair, if you're into the Christmas standards, this CD is NOT for you. If, however, at any point in your life you painted your nails black and hung out at a goth club, you might be intrigued by some of the interesting, and occasionally ascerbic takes on Christmas here. This is a widely eclectic collection of musical styles, from Benedictine chant to angry industrial, with a lot of very strange stops in between."
2,Poor Customer Service!,"I ordered Raybestos PGD981C ceramic brake pads but was sent AC Delco pads. I don't even know if these will fit my application. I have contacted the company TWICE to no avail. If I wanted GM junk, I would have ordered GM junk. I WANTED pro grade ceramic pads. I ORDERED front & rear pads to MATCH. That's NOT what I received! I will NEVER order from this company again! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! Or should I say NO CUSTOMER SERVICE, they obviously don't care once they get their money!"
4,My first Peculiar Crimes,"As titled, this is the first of the series I have read, and I liked it well enough I expect to buy more later. What else to say??"
3,A very exoteric read,"Fowler's second novel appeals too a wide and varied audience it is not esoteric, rather, exoteric. It's an easy read with sharp, undulating plot twists, and the foolery of the geriatric detectives Bryant and May. My, what capers they get involved in, from Crippin the feisty feline, to Tate the misunderstood, affable tramp, the book runs the gamut. Aside from the esotericism of Londons lost waterways, the book engrosses and amazes the reader by making the common occurence seem so illustrative. My hat is off to Fowler along with the totality of my current garb, so to speak. The only problem with the book, and this only pertains to an esoteric audience, is the overuse of the word esoteric."
1,Defective shock,Recieved a pair for Christmas. Installed them in late Jan (when the weather warmed up just a bit). A week later I noticed the passenger side shock was leaking on the floor of my garage. Checked with Amazon - return date expired 20 days earlier. No warranty info provided on the Amazon site. Very disappointed!
4,good,"After buying Ms. Harrison's other cookbook (called ""A taste for love""), I bought this one. There aren't alot of unique or innovative recipes in here, as there are in the other cookbook she wrote, but all the staples are included, from white bread to seven grain bread, and they taste great. I especially like the section on making your own jellies and special butters for the breads. Also, anyone who has allergies should definitely get this, as there's a whole section on breads for people who are allergic to wheat, etc. Please let me know when this author comes out with her next cookbook!"
1,the bread machine baker,I HAD TRIED THE CHALLAH RECIPE. IT WAS TO SALTY. I REALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THE AUTHOR MADE THIS ONE FOR HERSELF. MY MOTHER IN LAW WOULD MAKE UP RECIPES FOR FUNDRAISER COOK BOOKS THAT SHE NEVER TRIED BUT THEY USUALLY CAME OUT. THIS CHALLAH WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME AND INGREDIENTS.
1,avoid this one,"Don't waste your time or money on this Barbie CD - sloppy installation program, rough transistion between screens/pages, vocals badly out of synch, etc. An inferior product with little quality control. If you must buy a Barbie game for your little princess, go with ""Riding Club"" or ""Super Sports""."
3,Babie as sleeping beauty not so bad...,"I agree that it is a little awkward seeing Barbie as Sleeping Beauty particular when her name is Rose but never the less I'm glad I didn't read the reviews prior to getting the product. Technically we haven't experienced any problems. It is a basic game but nice for a 4 yr old familiar with fairy tales but also interested with Barbie and getting used to computers. There is only one section/maze, which usually requires parental help."
2,Not good!,"When I bought this for my daughter she was 4 years old. She needed help every time getting through the maze. Which wasted my time, she was supposed to be having fun, not frustrated. There is just nothing to do. Half the time you are just clicking people to wake up. Borring!!!!!! Save your money, my daughter was on to something else in no time."
5,Good Quality and Size,I am pleased with the quality of the paper for a 4 year old to practice his artist skills and also the 9x12 size
4,Recommanded book,"Very informative to the novice and advanced person into live food. In depth explanations. The only thing that should be improved is the pictures, colored pictures would add scientifically to this book."
5,Collapsible TaiChi Sword,"Even though the sword is very light when compared to an actual Tai-Chi sword, it is very easy to handle. It's portability is a plus and it has a great look to it. For a good practice sword I would highly recommend giving this one a try."
4,A great practice sword,"I love this sword. I was able to take it in my suitcase on a trip abroad. It is lightweight and very compact. It is easy to open, and happily it stays open when I practice my sword form. I like it so much I am using it in class now instead of my wooden practice sword."
3,Reviewed by a Moraga,"Good book that focuses on the city of Moraga, CA (near San Francisco) with some geneological information regarding the original (non-Indian) land holder, Juaquin Moraga. Traces lineage back to Pablo Moraga (Monterrey, MX), and then discusses the two Moraga families of Spain and the probable origin of the Moraga name for each of these families.Book details how the ranch became the city and the growth of the city."
4,The best KOTC yet!,"This is a great NHB/MMA video featuring 2 hours of nonstop action. The event takes place outdoors and is hosted by Don Wilson & Eddie Bravo (who does a good job on commentary). Lots of up and coming fighters are featured as well as a main event that pits Todd Medina against PRIDE star Daijiro Matsui. The production values on the video are great, and Ken Shamrock even makes a special appearance as a guest commentator. NHB fans should check it out."
1,Too basic,"The only worthwhile part of this book is the 3 pages on carbo loading. The rest is a total waste of time. I assumed that since the book was titled ""Eating for Endurance"" it was geared toward endurance athletes, who I assume had a certain level of knowledge when it comes to nutrition. It appears that Ms. Coleman has targeted high school health class with this book. Example: she devoted an entire chapter to the 6 classes of nutrients: carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamin, mineral, water. Are you kidding me? Like I couldn't have figured that out myself. Any information contained in this ""book"" can be located for free in many places on the internet. Save your money and research nutrition and/or endurance training. Do not buy this book, please, DO NOT buy this book!"
2,Disappointing,"Antarctica: Journey to the Pole (Antarctica (Scholastic))I searched high and low for fiction about Antarctica and was quite excited when I found this, but this book just didn't cut it for me. I have laboured through it but I was looking for something for a reading group in my year 5 class that stimulated their imagination about Antarctica and really engaged them. Sadly this book did not meet the mark. I will not be using this novel as it is not written in a way that captures the audience. The author seems to get caught up in family politics which are not particularly engaging. All in all I am disappointed."
4,An appealing book with a wise choice of words.,"The author of this book has an interesting dipiction of various settings throughout the story. His delineations of the settings in this story include an almost entrepreneurial type of writing not often seen in many of today's books. Although this story has a rather peculiar conclusion that has lead me to believe most readers under 25 with the exception of myself (I am fourteen) would not be interested in this book, I still believe it is very enthralling and a good read."
1,Not for me,"I don't care what the grown-ups say; this book was written for kids 9-12, so me being 12, I read it. It was horrible, gruesome, sad, gross, and I thought it had a strange ending. I'm sorry, but it just wasn't a great kid book. Adults may call it ""deep and touching,"" but I'm sorry I ever read it."
3,"Antarctica...COLD,MYSTERIOUS,WHALES...",I think this book is great if you like a adventure based on history.this book is definately not the best adventure I've read but it's interesting though.3 stars.
4,"Slow beginning, but got very interesting.","Antarctica: Journey to the Pole was an exciting and thrilling book about the journey to the South Pole. Jack Winslow and his sons plan a trip to be the first people to reach the South Pole. When they start their hard and long expedition, they face fierce challenges while on their quest to the Pole. The crew's loyalty will be tested. Will the journey be a success or a complete failure? This book is an exhilarating story that keeps you on your toes. Peter Lerangis describes the harsh cold and dangers wonderfully. The vivid descriptions made me feel as if I was on the ship in the harsh cold. If you like exciting sailing adventures, then this definitely is the book for you."
3,Great Pictures,"The book has no index and the table of contents is only pattern names and not manufacturers. Although this book has great pictures, unless you specifically know what you are looking for; it is difficult to find things in it."
5,Could Not Be More Pleased By This,"This is a phenomenal piece of work that blows away everything previously done by Moonspell. The darker, black metal influences that are demonstrated here fit perfectly with Robeiro's style. (As an aside, I actually thought that the vox on this album on certain songs sounded strangely enough like a deeper more fuller version of vox done by Dani Filth.) The haunting synth and chanting throughout the album also make this a classic. I highly suggest this album to both fans of Moonspell who want to see a darker side of Robeiro as well as fans of other heavier sounds who would find an interest in goth influenced metal with black metal influences. The sound here is definitely much more raw than previous works by Robeiro, but thankfully the production value does not suffer. This album has great variety in both speed and vocal styles, and I very highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre."
5,Fantastic,This album is amazing. It's great black metal for those who don't necessarily enjoy listening to blast beats all the time. The music on this album is very evil sounding and should be plenty of fun for the kids.
5,Out goes the smell,"Great product. No more smelly feet. My wife loves it! been using it for about two years now and she can wear any kind of shoes now, with or with socks or stockings. Fast to apply and really lasts all day !"
1,Packaging was terrible!,"When my husband opened this package, the AEROSOL can was extremely dented and crushed, the cap was cracked in so many places on this that we were surprised it stayed on during transportation. The envelope that it was contained in had no padding. It was really scary to think that an aerosol can had so little protection especially since it has the danger of exploding when punctured."
5,I've had this problem for years and have ...,I've had this problem for years and have tried several different products with no real results. Dr. Scholl's Foot & Sneaker Deodorant Spray did the job. I'd recommend it to anyone who has this problem.
2,Arrived Damaged,I purchased a shoe deodorizing spray. The shipping of the product was fast but arrived with a strong odor coming from the package. Had to throw out the product immediately due to the leakage of the spray from a broken cap and nozzle piece. Highly unlikely that I will be a repeat customer.
4,Works pretty good,"Spray on feet BEFORE putting shoes on. I focus on the top and underside of my toes. I don't think it fully eliminates odors, but it cuts it down dramatically. I haven't sprayed it in my shoes directly since I am using it as a preventative."
2,not effective,Sprayed product twice a day in sneakers. Worked for a few minutes smelling fresh. Then after about 20 minutes sweat funky smell overpowered spray. Sneakers two pair are two months old.
2,smells!,"I thought this was supposed to eliminate odor. It actually has an even worse smell. It makes your shoes retain a nasty scent that you can smell without even getting close to them. Its gross, I have to throw away a couple pair of flats now."
2,It's okay,"I've been dealing with foot odor for a little while now. This product left a white film all over my shoes without my noticing which was a little annoying. Also, while I was spraying my foot, if I sprayed one area for too long, that area would become numb almost. I had to rinse the product off because it started to hurt. Overall, not really happy with it."
1,Disaster..,"this product is a total disaster. please dont waste ur money on this. after use, it leaves your feet white in a very funny way. this feature is sure more embarassing than the odor itself. i just used it once and had to throw it because it didn't help at all.."
1,satifaction,This item wAs shiped with out all of the hardware. Very dissatisfied. Does not fit the truck very good and it is mounted to high on the truck. will not buy anything from this company again.
4,Great Practice on Grammar,"We used the 5th grade Grammar drill last year and loved it. They are short, to the point, and my student gets to stay sharp on his grammar skills!"
2,Probably a good recorder but weak mike amps.,Returned the unit because the amplifiers on the XLR imputs are not strong enough to generate a good signal.
3,"Good, old fashioned pulp horror","Andrew Neiderman is one of the worlds highest selling authors, mainly through his work as a ghostwriter after the passing of VC Andrews in 1986. His novels can often be a hit or miss affair. Fortunately, PIN is a hit, rather than a miss. PIN tells the story of Ursula and Leon, a pair of orphaned teenagers. Ursula is a sweet young woman who does her best to accommodate her mentally unstable older brother and his fascination with PIN, a mannequin from their father's doctors surgery. When Ursula falls in love, Leon and PIN know that they must take action, or risk seeing their family torn apart.Overall, PIN was decently written and offered just enough suspense to keep me turning the pages. Recommended for anyone who wants to read a good old fashioned mass market horror novel that doesn't rely on sassy characters, technology or glitter."
1,THIS BOOK IS IN SPANISH,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ARE TRULY LOOKING FOR THE SPANISH TRANSLATION FOR THIS VOLUME. Furthermore, if this is the book you are looking for, be aware that it takes forever to receive it. It took me five months to get it, and it's not even the book that I wanted.The only reason for the 1 star rating is because I find Amazon's listing rather misleading for this book. This is the only listing for the 13th Volume in the ""Fushigi Yugi"" series, and as I was looking for the English version, I assumed this was it. I don't know why Amazon would have every other volume availible in English, execpt for #13, but if you are looking for it, go to a bookstore to find it."
2,Turn signal/ License plate relocator,"Some what disappointed. Looks nothing like picture, the only thing you get is a chrome plated billet license plate bracket. I was expecting to receive turn signals ( turn signal/ license plate relocate kit ???) I see no way to utilize this with any type of turn signal lites. The quality of what you get is very good, but there is no way this was ever worth the retail price they list of $ 184.00. Barely worth the $26.00 plus shipping( $ 37.00 ). Power sport was very good on the re-shipping of product to my proper address and responded to my e-mails."
4,Great gift for 14 year old boy!,"I was a little skeptical because of the low price, but it turned out to be a great knife and the 14 year old boy that got it was very pleased."
3,Scary and unsettling,"Gonna Roll the Bones tells the story of a man, bored with his home goes and sets of to find adventure. Its very similar in some ways to the fairy/folk tale ""The boy who left home to find out about the shivers"". While I found myself enjoying the story the tale itself and the imagery may get a little scary for younger children.I had a few complaints about this book. Like one reviewer stated prior there is a very serious difference between the cover artwork and the interior illustrations. The cover with its sinister landscape and ominous colors is done in Wiesner's typical watercolors similar to his work on ""Tuesday"". The interior work is very loose sketches and heavy text. They fit the story but at times become quite spooky.Overall this was a good read and I did enjoy the illustrations but couldnt recommend this for someone wanting to read to children 6 and under."
4,Gonna Roll the Bones,"To be honest I was a bit disappointed in this book because I bought it because of the wonderful landscape on the cover and the inside of the book is nothing like that. Now having said that, the art work on the inside of the book is wonderful and does go with the story... I just wish the cover matched the story better. I would not say this is a book for a young child, the story and its illustrations are geared to older children."
5,Striking!,"History unfolding with color and style.Enjoyed watching master at work.History of use of sword very interesting' used sword made of rattan in Society ofCreative Anachronism style combat, and this video gave me plenty of new insight!"
1,IBM DeathStar - Expected life 6 months,After my drive died after 6 months I looked on some news groups to find lots of other people have had the same problem. I didn't replace this drive as I was worried it would just fail again.Note An Electronics fan is artifically making this hard drive get higher ratings than it should.Don't waste your money on this drive.
3,"When I first got this product, it took ...","When I first got this product, it took me awhile to cut them down to a size that fit my shoes. Unfortunately, the gel is difficult to cut, even with sharp scissors. And the pre-imprinted shoe shapes/sizes were the correct length for my shoe, but not the correct width. As a result, I cut the product too narrow for my shoe, so some of my toes hung over. Except for the annoyance of my toes hanging over the edge, the gel was very nice and shock-absorbing. And the inserts made my stretched-out shoes feel new again. In one pair of shoes, though (a pair of Doc Martin's), the product made my shoes feel too tight."
3,"While the product itself feels comfortable, it made ...","While the product itself feels comfortable, it made my shoes feel too tight, which was very uncomfortable. Maybe I need to purchase bigger shoes to be able to use a product like this."
3,I was so excited about testing these insoles. ...,"I was so excited about testing these insoles. I have problems with my feet and I thought all I needed was a good insole with a good arch. These insoles were soft and flexible, and I liked the cover and the ripples. One thing I didn't like about them was that they took up too much room in my shoes. In every pair of shoes I used them in (three), my shoes felt so much smaller--and it was very uncomfortable. I also didn't like the arch support, especially in my right shoe. I must not have much of my own support, because it really started hurting after a few days. If someone needs a good arch, I'd probably recommend this product to them. Otherwise, I'd just live with what comes originally in my shoes."
2,I was really looking forward to test driving ...,"I was really looking forward to test driving these insoles, but was really disappointed. They didn't seem any more comfortable than my old ones, maybe even less so. I do an average of four miles of walking each day on a college campus and a good set of insoles would be great. But these just didn't fit the bill."
3,They felt good at first when they weren't ...,"They felt good at first when they weren't in my shoes, and it was great how I could cut them down to my size. But when I put them in my shoes, they didn't make that much of a difference."
3,"After trying the gel insoles, I found them ...","After trying the gel insoles, I found them somewhat comfortable, but they made my shoes seem tighter. I tried them in several pairs of shoes, from inexpensive sneakers to dress shoes with a small heel (those were much too tight). This product is very similar to Dr. Scholl's Back Guard, which I like better. I couldn't tell that they had a gel-cushioning spring effect. I did notice there's just a bit more support in the arch. I think I'd recommend the Back Guard insoles."
2,Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Insoles,"I loved the feel of these when I first put them on, I bought them for a day trip to Universal Studios Florida so my feet wouldn't hurt at the end of the day. Just walking from the car to the inside of te gate, I was finding a seat to sit down and take them out. They can be cut to form fit, which I did and it fit inside perfectly, but then they slid down and bunched up under the arch of my foot. That's more discomfort than not having them at all, so out they went. Shame too, nice idea, maybe it depends on which type of shoes you were them with."
2,"When I wore these insoles in loafers, they ...","When I wore these insoles in loafers, they tended to slide forward and bunch up at the toe. When I wore them with lace-up shoes, I felt like I was walking on wet noodles. Compared with traditional foam insoles, the Massaging Gel insoles were a lot more hassle for little additional benefit."
1,If This is How Women Really Think....,"""It"" ain't ever gonna happen for this fella. It basically reads like an endless laundry list of women's ""do's"" and ""don'ts""- their expectations, their demands.She suggests that women like a guy who's relaxed and confident- but if I guy took all of this stuff to heart he'd never be relaxed and/ or confident- he'd be a basket case, constantly worried about what women think of him.Buy hey, maybe Nicole is right and I'm wrong- I haven't had much luck with women these days, but if all women are like her, then I guess I'll die a bachelor."
5,One of my favorites,"This book is not in print anymore, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. By the same author as ""Summer of 42"" and I first read this in my ""youth"". Is filled with great sarcastic wit - will make you laugh and then make you cry so have the tissues close at hand."
5,WONDERFUL!! A MUST READ - NO JOKE!,"I read this book when it first came out in the late '70's, and re-read it every few years or so. Recently picked it up again, and it's as funny as it was the first time!! The characters are wonderful, the wit and sense-of-humor of Raucher will make you laugh out loud. Run, don't walk, to your nearest used book store and look it up!"
1,craptacular,This is a horrible product! My husband says it is so unsafe he will not let me use it. Lesson learned: you get what you pay for!
2,Wheres Michael,"This dvd pertains to how Michael Jackson influnenced a man who is trying to start and promote his own career. He has a good singing voice and his tribute song to Michael at the beginning was nice but as i continued to watch the dvd, i was beginning to wonder, okay this is another MJ video, but lets get to Michael. Whoever made this dvd was trying to get his own publicity and notoriety on the coat tails of Michael Jackson. Dont let the cover picture fool you. There are better dvds out there on Michaels life. Shop around a bit."
4,Good Advice,"Simple, straightforward advice for those who want to do home shows. Everything from naming your show and printing invitations to what to do with your pets. Brings up some things that first-timers might not think about, such as proper lighting; finding out about any necessary permits; having helpers to greet people while you show off your work; and many others. If you've never done a home show and want to, this is a very good step-by-step guide."
2,came with a big hole in he waist,i have no complain about the packing and delivery time but the material of the product is like the pantyhose stocking and came with a big hole on the waist line so i couldnt wear them. they are for females with long torso.
1,Disappointed,Very disappointed with this video. Did not feel that it addressed these issues it spent more time identifying the problem and did not give good solutions on how to manage or resolve it.
2,Good thing we had a manual pump nearby!,"Worked great for about 3 overnight camping trips, but then just stopped working - no idea why. Had a manual backup plan, thank goodness! I won't buy this model again."
4,Pumping Powerhouse!,"I charged this little thing up in the hope that I would be able to keep my air mattress with a mystery (source yet to be determined) slow leak going for one last camping trip before retiring it.Much to my surprise, I did not have to hunt down a means to recharge the pump during my entire 5 day camping trip! And I had to re-inflate my queen size mattress at LEAST once every single day/evening. The deflating was nice for compact packing too.My only complaint on this pump would have to be the noise, it is quite loud. However if your air mattress doesn't need inflated in the middle of the night ... why complain? Myself, I'm replacing the mattress before I give up this pumping powerhouse. ;)"
3,"""Fits other brands"" needs a footnote, loud","This pump is likely fine for Coleman beds, but I bought it for the ""fits other brands and items"".Sadly, every airbed manufacturer seems to design their own, custom fill-vent. The Coleman was a full .5"" too small (diameter) to work with my Simmons and wouldn't fit my Aerobed either.The battery is a lead one, and not light. The quickpump running without a bed attached also seemed to be twice as noisy versus the 120V plug-in charger for the Simmons bed-- very much not quiet.For my purposes, and because of the noise level, Not Recommended. Coleman bed owners who don't mind the noise may be ok."
5,Great for inflating a Chimney Balloon draft stopper,"We use these pumps in our testing and returns lab for quickly inflating and deflating Chimney Balloons fireplace draft stoppers. They inflate the balloons to a constant pressure and the rechargable battery lasts forever. Better yet, they are durable and dont break when dropped on the floor. They are much better than the battery powered Coleman models."
5,So glad I purchased this!,"This pump couldn't be better! The battery lasts forever. I've used it for entire summers, only having to charge it once. I'm going on my third season and it's still working perfectly. It also deflates the mattress, very handy. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Convenient but not stong enough for a Sevylor,"We purchased two SEVYLOR TAHITI CLASSIC (U235/K79 - YELLOW) for our RV camping trips and the Coleman Rechargeable pump was a recommended item. Unfortunately the pump does not have enough power to fully inflate the kayak requiring additional manual inflation. The adapters also do not fit several of the Sevylor fittings so it is difficult to close off the valves without losing air. We have not selected a replacement pump yet so do not have a recommended pump yet, but this one is not recommended for the job."
2,Won't last past one season,"I so wish that I could write a positive review for this pump. The first time I pulled it out to blow up a kiddie pool with no wires attached, I was ecstatic and singing its praises (I have the feeling that a lot of the positive reviews here are from people who've had it for less than a year). However, after one winter the pump would not hold a charge. I purchased a replacement, and it was dead the next year as well. To add to the problems the pump 1) cannot be used with the charger plugged in (e.g. the pump cannot be operated while charging, so if you have a dead battery it's a paperweight) and 2) uses a proprietary battery that is wired DIRECTLY into the pump (I cracked it open to see if I could swap out the battery myself), and therefore cannot be easily replaced.I bought a corded pump and run an extension cord out to the pool now. Not nearly as sexy, but at least I know it will work next summer (I hope)."
3,Good when it works,"We bought this unit several years ago for an air mattress. The unit was fully changed and did the job. Fast forward a few years when we needed the mattress again, and the unit was dead. Charged it for ~ 6 hours, still dead. It would not power up or make any noise when plugged in.I found the unit will charge (slowly). I believe the unit needs ~ 16 hours fully charge a dead battery. There is also a fuse inside the unit (I'm not 100% sure if it would really be blown, but it's a possibility for those that have a fully dead pump).The one annoyance I have with the pump is that you cannot use it while it's plugged in so if you need it in a jam, you may have to wait those 16 hours."
3,Coleman Rechargeable Quick Pummp,It serves the purpose I need it for and when I need it while camping on the beach. Rechargeable is great
4,quickly inflates airbeds,I used this pump with a coleman inflatable bed and found it quickly inflates a bed within 2-3 minutes. I've used other pumps before and they took a little longer; this one also can be used to deflate the airbed and works just as fast.
3,Loud but works well,"Worked well for 3 days of camping, except that its extremely loud. Like a leaf blower.."
2,Worked Great for 1 Year - Now Wont Charge,"I bought this pump in November of 2011 so that I could blow up several air mattresses for camping. I got to use it about 15-20 times over the year and it worked great. Then, after the 4th charge we noticed that the charge light stopped coming on no matter how long the pump was charged. The pump now holds a long enough charge to blow up a single mattress about 45% of the way. We discovered this on our last fall trip where we had to lay blankets and sheets on the floor to make the bed remotely comfortable. I'm totally disappointed in this purchase and would recommend getting a pump that will last rather than one that will work for a year and then quit."
5,Good Job Coleman!,"I have 3 or 4 of these low voltage air pumps and this one is so far superior to the others I'm going to throw the others away. Good job Coleman! Better air flow, easier use (good handle, easy grip, nice bayonet attachment on the tips), and longer battery life."
2,Might be good i dont know.,"I bought this thinking it would be great no cords blow stuff up anywhere but got it home plugged it in and the charger light did not come on.I left it plugged in over night and the next morning nothing,so i phoned Coleman and they sent me a replacement part. Got it home plugged it in and same thing so i will have to get a charger and see if it will work."
2,Only Worked for a little while,"This pump came with my coleman inflatable bed. I used it to pump up the bed for my guests and got to use it about 10 - 15 times or so before it went completely dead. It lasted for 3 years but since I only got at most 15 uses out of it, I'm giving it 2 stars. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Good at first, then dies","I got one of these for use with my coleman inflatable kayaks, which I love. It worked great all summer, hardly ever needing to be recharged. But after its second winter with little use, it was dead. It just wouldn't charge. I got another one and the exact same thing happened -- great the first summer, died after the second winter on the shelf. I'm shopping around for a different replacement model this time."
2,Works great for 1-2 years,"Worked great for about 2 years, then recently just doesn't hold a charge. I guess it's dead. Seems like it should have lasted longer. I give it 2 stars since it did work well for over a year."
4,Works great for inflating whitewater boats,"I bought this pump in order to inflate whitewater boats (Sotar, Aire, Hyside) that are pre-rigged on trailers. We put the boats on the trailers, deflate, and then when we get to the river, we use the Coleman pump to re-inflate the boats. It does a great job of getting the tubes inflated enough to move them around before topping off.The one drawback is that the pump only comes with a 120vac charger, so if I need to recharge it in the car, I need to bring along an inverter. If Coleman made one of these with a 12vdc charger as well, I'd buy it."
2,Mind the recharging,"Pros-worked great when fully charged and rechargeable battery is newCons-still runs off the battery - so even if plugged in, but the battery is dead, need to wait for charge-died after 2 years of infrequent use - overnight charge produces anemic pressure - battery lost oomf"
2,Dead Battery,"Worked great for 2 years, but the battery inside does not hold its charge now even after recharging it overnight."
3,OK Pump,"I purchased this item some time ago, it works well and the charge stays with it a long time but it is a little weak; I use it for my inflatable kayak and always need to finish the job using the foot pump becasue this thing can't provide enough pressure. It does save a lot of leg work though!"
5,coleman pump,I used this item at someone else's house and had to have one. Since I received it we have used it many times and are very glad that we purchased one for ourselves. Would recommend this item to anyone.
1,Dead after second use!,"Wow, what a disappointment! I bought this for my husband, who's previous Coleman died after almost 10 years. The new one worked great the first two times we used it to blow up an air mattress. However, when we pulled it out last weekend to blow up a raft, it was dead. I expected more from Coleman."
1,Wont keep a charge after one year,"I purchased this product less than one year ago and only used it on two trips. I went to turn it on a year later and it was dead. I attempted to recharge it and after a few hours it still won't even turn on. If you don't use this product regularly I would stay away from it. I only use it in the summer for camping and boating and will go back to a wired pump, they don't seem to fail as fast."
3,Quick but Loud...,I purchased this pump to replace one that I had purchased years ago. This new one is much louder and seems to be made a little cheaper. Works goods but is LOUD!
4,excellent pump,I was shocked by how well this pump worked compared to my Coleman 4d quickpump. This rechargeable pump is much more powerful and filled my sons twin mattress in under a minute. I especially liked using it to deflate my kids inflatable bouncer. The charge holds for several days. My only disappointment was that the nozel adapters did not interchange between this and the 4d quickpump. I had hoped to be able to use them interchangeably.
4,"Excellent, fast, loud","Certainly recommend. FAST on my queen 10"" thick mattress. Empty to full and tight in 75 seconds! It is loud, but its only running for a little over a minute so a simple trade-off given the cheap cost. It deflates the mattress in the same time, and sucks/squeezes it flat for folding. Charge last forever, works great! Recommend."
1,Read instruction for charging and its good to go.,"We followed the instructions for charging right out of the box and used it once. It performed great. We returned home and did what the instructions said...charge after use/before storage. One week later, took pump out for use again and ...NOTHING! Does not work! Returned home and and tried to charge but again..NOTHING. DEAD! I will attempt to contact Coleman and Amazon if necessary and can update after that."
2,Not the best option,"We bought this pump a couple of years ago and used it a few times a year. It worked fine during this time, but recently failed us when we really needed it. We needed it this past weekend so I charged it overnight before our guest arrived. When I tried to blow up the air mattress the pump did not turn on. I assume the battery is dead but there is no easy way to know for sure. Instead of wasting time and money buying a replacement battery (3rd party - not offered by Coleman) I decided to buy the hand pump. It actually inflates our air mattress faster than the battery powered unit and is much much quieter. No more worrying about inflating the mattress late at night after the kids are asleep. The hand pump won't wake anyone up and will presumably last forever. It also costs less. I call that a win/win."
2,Pumped once,"I bought this pump with my second kayak. I used it once to inflate the kayak and it stopped working. Living in a rural area, the cost of returning it for repair or replacement was more than the cost of buying a new one. Use a hand or foot pump; it's cheaper."
1,"You MUST have a ""backup""!!!","I bought this item along with a Coleman Queen Mattress. 30 mi N of Durango and a long, long way from civilization, I found this thing didn't hold a charge after 12 hrs of charging. After trying to blow the mattress up by mouth for 30 min and almost passing out, I abondoned the idea, having to sleep on the ground! DON'T RELY ON THIS ITEM TO HOLD A CHARGE for very long! I have since purchased a Coleman ""double action"" hand pump - no batteries/ no electricity!"
1,Never Worked and Unreturnable,"This pump is an absolute piece of junk. Straight out of the box, it never worked. It's just a big hunk of useless plastic. Doesn't turn on, doesn't take a charge.In addition, to return it, you have to get yourself to a Coleman Repair/Distribution center. If one of those isn't reachable (and it probably isn't), you have to ship it to them and YOU HAVE TO PAY THE SHIPPING. So it'll cost about what you paid for it just to get your money back.Complete Rip Off. Absolute Waste of Time and Money."
1,Do not do business with Coleman,"I am so glad you asked for a review. I wouldn't know how my Coleman Rechargeable Quick Pump works, because I can't use it! It came without the pinch nozzle adapter, which I need. I called Coleman, and because the young man I spoke with was in a giant hurry to get me off the phone, he did not pay any attention to the model number or my question about whether the adapter is the same for the MANY different models they have of this pump. So naturally he sent one that doesn't fit. Since then I've sent 2 emails through the Coleman site to support with complete and specific information about my order - and have never received so much as an acknowledgment, let alone the right part. All this for a $2.50 adapter! I'm totally disgusted, and would reiterate - DO NOT do business with Coleman!Thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak, Priscilla Joyce"
1,Traking/shipping,"1st time I use Amazon over Ebay and 2 things blow up. 1 shipping is half the cost of the item, and 2 tracking stops and the shipment date gets pushed back!? This maybe the 1st and last order I make to fall into the pricy shipping and slow delivery. At least with Ebay it will tell me upfront FREE SHIPPING. As for the product this thing is great, my buddy left it out in a rain storm and it works fine!! Buy is on Ebay with FREE SHIPPING that FAST!"
1,"Very, very loud","I bought this pump recently and was shocked about how loud it was. Just an ear piercing screeching noise that was horrendous. Took me about 15 minutes to inflate a queen size air mattress, and it didn't even inflate completely. I recommend keeping the return information until you actually charge and use it and not to pay attention to the flier in the box that says to call Coleman if you have any problems."
5,Great pump works great at lake house!~,Great pump works great at lake house!~ We have all types of lake ridding toys and this really worked well. For tubbing rafts etc. Coleman has always been dependable!~
5,Great Pump,This type of pump is so much better than the battery operated ones that came with our air mattresses. It fills the mattress FAST and FULL. Would definitely recommend this product.
3,very loud,"this blower is very loud,it works great,just very loud,i think it maybe defective,my nephew has 1 and its not this loud"
3,Must be charged prior to use,"The issue: You cannot plug the pump in and have it run off of AC. It must be charged prior to use. This is frustrating when you forget to charge it prior to use. It also doesn't tell you when it is charged and how much power it has left.The rest of the pump is great. The battery life is good (~10 fills of a queen air mattress) and it holds a charge without being used for awhile (at least 2-3 months).The unit is large, maybe 8 inches long. This might important for some.I would buy this pump again because I think it is a good value. If it could run off of an outlet, it would be perfect for me."
2,Good but not lasting,"It's rechageable which means it is for convenience.Yes, it's quite convenient and works well.However, it's rechageable which means the battery won't last forever.After less than 50 times of recharging, it dies.I recommend 12V or 120v one if you can use power outlet at the site."
1,disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. While the idea is intriguing, essays set around the theme of place I found the tone overly self indulgent and whiny, similar to Gordon's previous and also disappointing memoir, the Shadow Man. While the portrait of her mother was intriguing, the rest just didn't have enough insight to carry me through and at times, Gordon feels compelled to be so self revealing (telling the world that she likes to do her reading topless) that it's positively embarassing."
3,Good splitter cable,Works as stated. The main reason I bought this for was to try and use my old PS2 wireless remote so I could program it to my Harmony 880. The product works fine although for some reason on my PS3 thinks that when I have this on USB1 that it's a controller when it's not. It gave me issues with my controller but I believe this is the case for any USB device that plugs into port 1 on the PS3.
2,Minimal performance enhancement,Bought AudioVox 7001's (3 watt/7 mile) to communicate with my father during hurricanes in South Florida. He lives less than a mile away; and we are in a flat suburban area. Got marginal reception if we both stood in the front yard (basically line-of-sight). If either of us went inside the house--nothing.The five watts of the Midland radios provides only minimally enhanced performance over what I got with the Audiovox. If we both stand at the front windows of our houses we get OK reception. If either of us goes to another part of the house the reception is completely dropped. And forget about them working inside if the hurricane shutters are up.I agree with the majority of the reviewers. Stepping up to these 5 watters will probably only net you a 10% increase in range over the cheaper GMRS walkie-talkies. These are still glorified toys with a max range of 1-2 miles under the conditions most folks would want to use them.
2,Just like the cheeper ones,Don't waiste your money on these 5 watt radios. They work no better than the 2-3 watt ones. 2 to 3 miles if your in open country with no obstructions. Most times maybe 1 mile.
1,Midland two way radios,"With two cars following each other we experienced communication problems and the cars were only yards apart at times. This combined with many people converging on the same channels was frustrating. Apparently, you need to be in an isolated area in order to maximize their capabilities. I was very unimpressed and up to 14 miles is questionable."
4,work fine when I bought them,These worked great when my crew needed to contact each other from ground to 3-4 story roof levels. They have headsets but the guys found they preferred to pocket the units and pull them out when they wanted to talk. They have clips but they didn't trust them while climbing up ladders.
5,exceptional,THIS IS REALLY GREAT!Partly because of the fabulous music by Hilary Stagg!ITs a very soothing dvd! I recommend it highly!
2,Falling apart after 2 months!,Look very nice and felt very comfortable as well. After about 2 months the entire bottom of one of the shoes is falling apart. I guess some times you get what you pay for.
3,Size,The shoe is larger than I expected. The size of shoe is larger tham most shoes of the same size.
1,Soles fall apart after a month,"I thought this was going to be a good deal but after about a month the soles started to fall apart and collapse on the inside. They use some weird grid inside the heel sole to save on material or something and it just collapses under regular use. Horrible shoes -- especially from a 'big name.' I'll never buy another Kenneth Cole product again.For what it's worth the shoes still have a decent shine, but if I can't walk on them, what's the point?"
3,Shiny,THESE SHOES ARE PERFECT FOR A WEDDING OR A FUNERAL. NOT THE MOST COMFORTABLE OR STYLISH SHOE BUT THEY ARE NOT EXPENSIVE. THERE IS A DESIGN ON THE BOTTOM THAT SERVES NO PURPOSE AND CAUSES THE SHOES TO LOSE TRACTION ON WET OR SLIPPERY FLOORS. OVERALL THEY ARE PERFECTLY SENSIBLE DRESS SHOES.
4,unlisted slip-on shoes,"I am very pleased with the shoes. They appear to be well made, are comfortable and I am very pleased with the price. A winning combination!"
2,"Nice looking, but doesn't fit","The shoe looks very nice, but it is very narrow and slightly short to size."
3,Unlisted leather shoes,The shoes is like the photo but it fits large (almost 1 size larger). It's too expensive to send back so it will sit useless in my closet until I find someone to give it away.
3,"Nice shoes, but...","As most other reviewers mentioned, the soles are pretty flimsy. I actually went around the corner to my neighborhood shoe store and had them apply sole and heel protectors before the soles had a chance to show just how flimsy they were. Cost about $20, but my cobbler said the rubber soles should be good for a few years before they wore down and new ones had to be applied. I felt it was worth the investment, though the application of the protectors actually cost more than the sale price for the shoe."
2,My mother was right!,"My mother was right. You get what you pay for! While these shoes look good they do not seem (to me) to be actual leather as is claimed. I am tempted to cut open the inside covering to see if they are plastic since they do not feel like leather. I would advise Amazon to test them. Also, they are quite a bit larger than the marked size, a good half inch longer than my other same sized shoes. In short, I would NOT buy them again."
3,"Nice looking, but too big","I bought these, but am exchanging them for a smaller size. The toe area is just too big. They look nice and stylish though."
3,Its ok,This action figure i didnt like very well because of how the face looked and its durability. The head sculpt on kit isnt really great could of been better. The durability is not good because the right leg is longer than the left one! So it falls easily. Good thing it has a base!
3,Ok for a Star Wars Fan,"I bought this for my 8 year old son. He really likes it but, the first day he got it the lightsaber broke off. Otherwise he enjoys it."
2,Don't really like it,"I DON'T RELLY LIKE THIS FIGURE. THERE ARE FOUR THINGS WRONG WITH IT. ONE, THE HEAD DOSEN'T TURN, TWO, THE LEGS ARE UNEAVEN, EVERYTIME I STAND HIM HIM UP, I HAVE TO PUT HIM IN SOME FUNKY POSITION, THREE, EVERYTIME I DUEL HIM WITH PALPATINE THE LIGHT SABER BLADE FALLS OUT, AND FOUR, HIS ARM WON'T STAY STRAIGHT.BUT HE IS STILL COOL FOR DISPLAY."
3,A New Life,"I liked this very small book. It did teach me several things that I didn't know. I hope to someday move from Georgia to the State of Oregon and there was some information in this book that made the buying of this small book worth the price. The book is ""a matter of fact"" type of book and the style of writing is a little dry but it offers good advice. Moving to Rural America should take more thought than most people are willing to give. Remember the TV show ""Green Acres"" in the 1960's? This author gives you some thoughts about what you should do and consider before you move to the country. It's not all roses. Regards, Keith Renick, Peachtree City, Ga."
3,"Fine, except for the last chapter","The book contained useful information, but the final chapter about socially adapting in a rural community was tacky and superficial."
5,Biography of Britain's most highly decorated soldier of WW1,"Anne Clayton has had unprecedented access to the Chavasse family papers to put together this excellent book about Captain Chavasse's life. He won a Military Cross in 1915, his first Victoria Cross during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and was posthumously awarded his second VC for actions at the opening of the 3rd Battle of Ypres in 1917. The book describes his life, hopes and loves and fears and gives a very good picture of what an educated professional thought and felt in the early years of this century."
3,Decent but not great,Title basically said it all. This is a game that's worth buying if you can find it for $20 - $30 or better yet cheaper but it's not worth $50. My main flaw with this is that it was too easy.
4,"Good, but could be better","In search of a FPS for PS2, I picked this game up. I am not dissapointed by the game with a solid story mode [yet short] or detailed graphics. Halo [for Xbox] this game is not. But, its a similar game lacking in gun variety however.'Area 51' really thrives in the online mode with games always going on, allowing you to stop and go whenever you please with up to 15 other players nationwide in many different levels.Overall, a good single player game, a weak multiplayer mode [it could have had co-op], but a great online mode."
3,"Overrated and a little cheap, but well done","If you go in for the first-person shooter thing, this game will certainly liven up your typical experience: it's smooth, it's jumpy, and it's relentless.At the same time, it's a little cheap and overrated. It's not a genre-defining game or anything, and you get killed after a couple of swipes from an alien...which drops you back into the action pretty far back as a reset if you're not careful. It's cheap that way.The graphics are pretty swell, but in the end it isn't Doom 3 or anything."
2,B--O-R-I-N-G,"How this game is getting 5 star reviews is beyond me. This has got to be one of the most boring games I've played in recent years. There is very little variety in combat situations and in who you are fighting. It is just the same old, same old level after level. This game is as boring as David Duchovny's acting and monotone voice. Potentially good story line but falls short in my opinion."
4,More fun than the Arcade version,"I remember playing the arcade version of area 51 when i was a kid and i loved it. Now that the game is out i was excited to get it and play it. Everything in the game is superb. the controls are easily used and the graphics are amazing. The storyline is interesting, and pieced together as you go through the game finding different secret documents that you can read later. However, this is not mandatory, so some people can essentially go through the game without knowing the story."
4,THIS GAME IS AWESOME IN ITS OWN SPECIAL WAY,"it starts out pretty confusing until the first level but then its justyou and you'r squad hiding behind a box trying not to get killed as thousands of aliens swarm you. it was better than halo in mostt ways like graphics and stuff but had no vehicles. the only bad thing about this game is that i was really hoping for a co-op mode, and there are only like 5 weapons to choose from but it was kind of scary at some parts and there are tons of plot twists so it kind of makes up for it"
1,Not As It Seems,"BEWARE, this is NOT the same release as the original vinyl LP from Mustang Records. Even though the basic cover art from the LP was used for this disc, only 5 out of the 26 tracks are from KRLA King Of The Wheels. This is misleading and a big disappointment since I had the LP years ago. This is really just a compilation containing tracks from KRLA King Of The Wheels. Sound quality varies from not bad, to eeech! At least a couple of tracks sound like they were taken from a vinyl record. There are other compilations and collections I would look at before choosing this one. I wish I had known..."
5,Healing Through the Mass,"This is especially good for Catholics but it would be interesting for an open minded Christian to understand why the Mass is so important to us. I think many Catholics attend Mass without really understanding what is taking place and this book guides you through all the parts of the Mass, the prayers that are said and the meaning behind them. I'm finding it very interesting and I thought I knew enough of it, but I'm finding new things that make Mass more meaningful to me. This is a good study for understanding the Mass and Catholic theology. It's easy to read and loaded with good examples. This is down to earth."
1,one star for the for stars,"Another boy with a pretty voice. This time, however, the music just doesn't hold up. Are they purposely trying to make songs without choruses? If so, bravo, they've succeeded. The lyrics are also somewhat amateurish and sophomoric. ""playing at your party with all the freaky people."" Sure whatever you say. There are so many people, past and present, who have done a better job at this type of music. Spend your money on Elliot Smith, Nick Drake, Skip Spence, Graham Parsons, Will Oldham or even John Denver for that matter. The For Stars may hit the high notes, but they miss the mark."
5,Book Arrived Quickly,"Fast service and a super-useful book that I bought for a friend who loves quotations. Should be reprinted, I think."
1,is this supposted to be a comedy??,I was looking to delve into the world of noir fiction writing. normally i read more conventional literature. Now i know why i steer clear of these pot boilers.The main character was totally ridiculous. Do men like that really exist? Not too bright.I honestly had to put it down about half way through because I just could not swallow any more of it.
4,"Clear, but not in order","If you are planning to use this for self study, you will need to read through the whole book before starting your study. In lesson 4 you need to know things introduced until lesson 18 to do the exercises. Explanations are short, but to the point. If you do not have a teacher, this is not going to be easy."
2,Pilot?,"Difficult to read, not because of light but just the numbers too small. The Tachymeter portion is not usable as there is no standard start/stop chronograph mechanism. Also the scale is so small, you need additional magnification. Why is called Pilot is beyond my comprehension!The watch is beautiful though and keeps good time in traditional analog manner. Great price!"
3,interesting but not always true,"This is an interesting book in many respecsts. It combines a vast amount of information without real evidence to connect the facts. In amny cases the book is simply not true. Eisenberg uses metaphors which are not true. For example he says that one species installed another in its gut for nutrition. It may have happened accidentally through evolution but I don't believe any creature installed another on purpose. Where is evolution. There are several examples of this sort.Eisenberg states that the human race dominates and that the bacteria(for example) have lost ""market share"" He should read Lewis Thomas ""The Fragile Species"" who makes a case (with data) that the human race is simply a small offshoot of a small branch of evolution and that the bacteria and other groups by sheer weight and numbers far outclass the human race and have survived far longer."
4,A Planetary Primer,"There is a wealth of insights regarding Man and his dependencies on the immense cast of largely unseen earthly agents. Eisenberg employs pre-Bible myths and ancient legends and more recent concepts to entice moderns to manage our resources. This was not an easy read for me, sometimes I was lost his erudite descriptions and discussions and sometimes the message failed to connect with me. But on the whole this was a most worthwhile volume."
3,MKD,"WELL, IT SEEMS AS THOUGH ANOTHER CLASSIC FIGHTING GAME OF MORTAL OMBAT IS COMING OUR WAY. I CANT SAY I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CAST OF THIS GAME... IN OTHER WORDS... THE CHARACTERS KINDA SUCK. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ALL THE CLASSIC MK CHARACTERS? SURE THE ADS WILL TRY AND TELL YOU THAT THE CLASSICS ARE BACK, BUT ALL THEY REALLY SAY IS BARAKA... OOOOOOOOH, BARAKA HOLY CRAP HES A FREAKING CLASSIC! WHOOPIE... ONE CLASSIC CHARACTER. IM DISAPPOINTED WITH IT. ANOTHER THING. WHO REMEMBERS THE 2D MK GAMES? I DO. THEY ROCKED HARD. MK DARK ALLIANCE SUCK REALLY BAD. IT JUST SUCKED. OTHER THAN ALL THAT... THE GAME SHOULD BE GREAT WITH THE KONQUEST MODE, PUZZLE FIGHT, AND CHESS KOMBAT (FOR ALL YOU LITTLE NERDS OUT THERE). IM JUST GONNA RENT IT. IF I FIND IT APPEALING. I MIGHT JUST BUY IT..."
5,JUST REMEMBER,If you want to play online- you need a cable modem or dsl conection. Also-for someone who never experienced Mortal Kombat in video parlors and arcades in the 90s- buy this game and experience Mortal Kombat. If your like me and have a girlfriend and a car- someone who did MK during the 90s- this game is nothing more than a rental. I spent 50 hard earned dollars for the last game and it was terrible only 9 charactors.Find something else to do for 50 bucks like gassing up your car for 5 weeks.
4,KABAL all the way !!!!!!!!!!!!!,mortal kombat deception a long awaited game much better than deadly alliance the way u can use the background to kill your opponents is awesome and kabal is by far to me the best playable charecter hes awesome hes fatalities are amazing even in a game red dragon clan leader kills all!! i recommend this game but i further more recomend kabal learn how to use him in the arcade mode and youll be unstoppable!!
1,I don't agree with the first review at all.........,So far I'm very disapointed with the konquest on this game...the character is almost impossible to control accurately and the graphics are pretty lame.Try another MK game but forget this one....Armageddon and S'Monks are way way better.
3,"Fun game, but not good for a fighting game.","Mortal Kombat, in my opinion, went downhill when Mortal Kombat 4 was relased. The projectiles are useless now, you can easily dodge them. You automatically get back up after getting knocked down, I like it when you can attack when your on the ground. Death Traps hurt the game more, one hit and you can die! I liked Deadly Alliance better when you can impale people with swords/daggers and it had a wall system!Overall, its a fun game, but not so great competive wise."
1,What a let down.,"This CD was not worth what I paid for it. The music is lousy. I was verydissapointed with this CD and threw it away. The $35,00 price tag was verydissapointing. Sorry excuse for a soundtrack."
5,As unforgettablel as the show!,"Moody and magical, Cavalia sweeps the listener into the historical mist of what arguably ranks among the most sensational equine productions of modern times."
2,Cheap looking,Very disappointed. After I received it I wanted to return it. Amazon said I had to return it to Target. Target said it had to be returned to Amazon. I'm stuck with it and not happy.
3,"Musically nice, but inaccurate.","If you like Harry James live, buy it. Just be warned this is an assembeled show edited together from multiple sources. Presented as a bulletin interrupted Harry James broadcast from the wee hours of June 6, 1944, the program starts with a CBS (Columbia) intro, and is interrupted by the WOR (Mutual network) bulletin...NOT!More listening, and we're back to CBS.On the one hand, I applaud Jazz Hour for releasing big ban radio remotes, on the other hand, I wish Jazz Hour would not edit, but rather present historically accurate broadcast material, even if it doesn't ""flow""."
4,"Not his best, not his worst","When in 1996 Foul Play press re-released Stronghold and House Of Cards, they planned on re-releasing all the other books a little at a time. I guess they scraped that idea. I have been waiting since, and no new books.So, Stronghold, should you buy it? Read it? Absolutely, it's grand. Not his best, and why this should be re-released with House of Cards still baffles me. Other Ellin books like The Dark Fantastic, Very Old Money, or even the Bind or Mirror Mirror on the wall would be better suited to try to grab a new generation of readers.But lets face it. No other mystery writer, with the exception of Agatha Christie , and maybe Ellery Queen, could write as well as Mr. Ellin, just well crafted, strong, mesmerizing novels. Its a shame more of his books arent avaliable today. He's hard to beat."
3,Man Picks His Butt,"I enjoyed it but if you're watching the beach video, has anyone noticed that there is a man that picks his butt in one of the scenes? I was actually shocked to see this! My husband thought I was nuts but them I showed him and he was like ""What the Heck."" Why would they put that in such a nice video like this! Other than that, it's pretty cool!"
1,HD clips that no one would want to view,"Thought it would be one of those cool things I could just put on the blu-ray for ambience. Has HD quality vids but plays like a .gif or .swf file on repeat. The creators didn't match nearly as close as they should. It is a FAIL at a repeat video track. With the lengths of the videos being so short repeat is very obvious. Overpriced, useless, distracting, under-developed, glitchy, It's hard to say anything else good about this product. Worth < $5."
3,Something must be wrong.,There must be something wrong with the title of this CD. Seeing as Tommy Dorsey Died in the year 1956.
1,A major disappointment,"~This DVD has two major flaws.First, it is like a collection of uncorrelated pieces of video segments, no central theme, just jump from one to another. And similar segments of the same scene will appear several times in different places with no reason.Second, the view is really short-sighted. It gives the impression that someone is shooting his backyard, instead of the biggest national park. Always a few animals at a small place, or even one small dirty ugly broken tree with a deer. The~~ same non-exciting scenes you will encounter numerous times everyday and which you will never want to pay attention. But here it is used to represent the most beautiful park in the world.After all, after watching this DVD, you will get the feeling that a small county park near your home is much more beautiful than yellowstone.~"
3,"UNITED STATES ""One"" / IRAQ ""Zero""","This is not bad for the layman with an Interest in current events in the Middle-east. This book is by no means is an answer to all, but a very good crash course in the regional players and politics. The book only traces back the historical trail of these resent events to just prior to Desert Shield/Storm and does not go into detail of prior ""blowback"" to the current situation in the gulf. The book goes into some overview on WMD with emphases on chemicals/biological and the SCUD delivery system. Also all the major weapons, equipment and tactics of the Iraqi/U.S. possible upcoming land and Air campaigns are covered. As final word this book is by no means for the professional researcher or historian but for the average ""Joe blow"" glued to the TV watching this highly possible conflict with Iraq unfold on CNN/FOX news."
4,Gardening with Grandma,Ganny Bun makes the rows in the garden just as straight as my grandmother did when I was young. This delightful book will entertain and actually help teach a child how to grow a vegetable garden!
5,Tiny Green Thumbs,"This book is filled with wonderful spirit,that will inspire any age to grow things! The illustrations are magical,as is the text.This is definitely a book to have."
3,Frozen Earth,"Too techical, not general enough to engage one that is not experienced with that material."
5,Frozen Earth--Ice Ages,"I liked this book. I have known about ""Snowball Earth"" for a long time. I have studied Geology and read many books about the ice ages. This author explains the concepts skillfully. It is too bad that some readers do not understand the concepts of geology, astronomy and earth sciences. But this author gives an organized and clear story of the history of our planet. Ice has played a critical role in the evolution of our planet.He notes that we are currently in a inter-glacial (warm) period. Guess what? The ice will come again. Humans should think about this and plan accordinally.Sara Howard, Author of ""Something Funny Happened on The Way to The Moon"" and ""The Biggest Explosions in The Universe""."
4,Good History on Ice Ages and Earth's Climate,"Frozen Earth is a very good history of the earth's ice ages. The writing is a bit academic at times, and often feels a little too detailed (which is normally a compliment, but seems to slow down the pace of this book more than it should have). This book would be an excellent resource for students of geology and climatology. If you are interested in climate change, this book would make an excellent companion piece to ""The Discovery of Global Warming"", because ""Frozen Earth"" could have been aptly titled ""The Discovery of Ice Ages""."
1,For a Preemie,This product is great if your child is a month old. My grand daughter is 1 and this was way too small for her and accessories were for a very young infant. Not at all what we were led to believe. Not worth the price and very HIGH delivery charges. Look for something else or you will be VERY disappointed. Purse and accessories lay in toy box and never played with :=( No interest what so ever and she sooooooooo wanted a purse.
3,A bit of a let-down,"While I really liked Wolf Brother, this wandering sequel was just too dull for me. The story never really seems to go anywhere quickly and the folklore and mythology strays far to much into gibberish and nonsense. Yes, I know these were primitive people with primitive cultures but most of it is so detatched from anything that I am familar with that I just couldn't care.If there was a stronger sense of urgency (the plot concerns finding a cure for sick forest people) and key plot developments happening in every second chapter it would have been better. But it drags and slows and creates little atmosphere.I expect the next book in the series to bounce back like a brick in the face. Anything other than this."
2,slow,The product is fine. The only problem was next day delivery ($24) turned out to be 6 day delivery. Still waiting for that refund on shipping from Amazon..
4,More Wolf please!,"I loved this book almost as much as the first. It's full of action, intrigue, and Torak's desperation to save his people. I loved learning more about the world of this series - it's people, beliefs, and history. The spirit world continues to play a major role in the series, and this is the one area that confuses my students but truly reflects religious beliefs of the historical period.There was plenty of action in this book - Torak and other characters always seem to find themselves in life-threatening scrapes. Of course, some of the rescues were a bit too convenient. Since these stories are written in the style of myths, I didn't worry too much about the rampant deus ex machina.My only real complaint is that I want to hear more from Wolf. His unique voice really sets this series apart and I want more. I look forward to reading book 3 and finding out more about the Soul Eaters who are set on ruling the world through power (and demons!)."
5,EPIC.,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot. Lavish descriptions of what their lifestyle was like, and different beliefs, this story is really educational but also epic. The characters are amazing, I love the plot, and they writing is amazing. Five stars!!!"
2,medium to low quality disc,"as compared to other discs of Kay Kyser, this one was made as live broadcasting. I own this disc, and think that tne quality and the sound of it are very low"
1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE+NO REFUNDS=BUY TAXCUT,"OK, I'm something of a nut on the subject of corporate responsibility. In short, I have no problems with INTUIT doing anything they wnat with their software, as long as they give me enough knowledge to not buy thier product.ALL 1-800 numbers for Turbo Tax have been elmininated. In fact, I can find no phone number to talk to a live person even at my expense. They have an web-based portal to talk with a live agent that I have been trying to access since Thursday, with absolutely no success.This appears to be a very dishonest company. Even if their software were better (and I do not think that it is) I would suggest promoting a bit of corporate accountability by taking your hard earned money elsewhere.-glenn"
1,No,Due to product activation I cannot recommend this product. It requires me to purchase an additional copy of the software just to use it on my laptop. I certainly won't be buying QuickBooks or any other Intuit product after this.The instructions saying you can install to multiple machines are FALSE!
1,Do NOT buy this tax product!,"Intuit has gone to great lengths to make their turbtax product nearly IMPOSSIBLE to use starting this year. With such an unforgiving activation scheme, you can only use ONE PC to do your taxes--If you want to do partially at home and partially at work for example, forget it. And in order to include this activation scheme, the cdrom automatically installs software that includes spyware and that stays on your computer using resources every time you boot up even if you uninstall turbotax! They've gone to great measures to encourage you to try TaxCut instead--Do It!"
1,Deceptive product,This product installs a monitor software program that may track and report all of your software and data to a server on the Internet. The software runs whether the TurboTax program is active or not. The software may prevent you from accessing your tax records if you use a new computer or upgrade your present machine because a new key activation has been refused by Intuit. Save yourself a lot of grief and headaches and buy a different product from another company. This software essentially installs a virus on your machine...
2,package was missing the Product Key,"At my own postage expense I had to return TurboTax Business 2002 to Intuit for a refund. I'm going to by a replacement copy, but I'm not happy about it."
1,They'll take any chance to screw you out of money,"I've been a TurboTax user for many years for both business and personal. This year, they shipped their business CD in a case with a triple tab going through the hole in the middle of the CD. The tabs are so small, that it is nearly impossible for a person with big hands (like myself) to press all three at once and at the same time lift the CD out of the case. When I did, the CD cracked..."
4,turbotax for business,User friendly and easy to load/intersperses with Quickbooks. Love the easy-to-use tax forms for corporations and partnerships.
1,Mean & Nasty,"I have been a loyal user of Turbotax for many years, business and deluxe. This year, after installation of both products, my hard drive crashed, and trying to get my products re-""activated"", involved a lot (and I mean a lot) of useless (and I mean useless) internet chat-time, and at least three wait-on-the-phone calls (where you have to have a pin to call)(which they DON'T tell you they're banging you for $$$ each), and finally get them to send me replacement CD's - which don't work either, and I gave up..."
1,TurboTax for Business,I have used this product for the last four years. It installs easily and I have had no problem in this regard. Instructions and help are quite minimal and I have found Intuit to be very user unfriendly. You cannot get help from them on any problem. I would recommend that a person give serious consideration to any alternatives before purchasing this product. It also requires that one purchase a separate to do state taxes. I beleive that to be a ploy to draw a customer in and then get more money.
1,TurboTax user since 1995 switches To TaxCut,I've been a fairly happy TurboTax user since 1995 (still have all the old copies on my shelf just in case). Once I found that Intuit had taken a product activation route I decided I didn't want to risk my time critical data to that risky scheme. I'm one of the many that delays their tax filing as long as possible. I simply won't take the chance of TurboTax deciding it won't print my returns on April 15. Hopefully TaxCut will be as good a product as TurboTax used to be.
1,Avoid this spyware to save yourself trouble,"After perhaps a decade of buying and using TT, I have to recommend avoiding it. Trouble include leaving behind running (and slowing your machine down) stuff, even after uninstallation. Forget about carrying it to a different machine for last minute printouts, etc. I am not against copy protection ala WindowsXP, but this reeks to high heaven!!"
4,My daughter loves this,My daughter has been watching Wizard of Oz since she was an infant. Now that she is older it is scary to her. So I searched out an Oz Kids video and thought this one would be a good start since it has a familiar characher (Toto) in the title. She loves it and asks for it several times everyday. She hasn't been scared by it and in fact claps and laughs at different scenes.
5,excellent,"This is well written, thorough, entertaining, and really a superb history lesson. Great Job Mr. Haygood."
4,Decent biography,"This book is about Sammy Davis as reflected through a prism of the black experience in America. I'm not sure that's the most interesting way to present the life of this great entertainer, but Haygood has written a pretty good book, especially detailing Davis' formative years in vaudeville. Sammy Davis was a better singer than Dean Martin and funnier than Frank Sinatra, and he could dance better than both of them put together, and that's why he's worth reading about. The fact that he was black man in a white man's world was only a part of his character, not the centrality of it, as Haygood presents.There is much less about the music that is Davis' most enduring legacy than one would like. I would have preferred more on his impressive contribution to our popular culture, but that will have to wait for a more definitive biography."
2,Not about Sammy,"This is a very well written book. Unfortunatley it is not about the life and times of Sammy Davis Junior as it professes to be. It is an essay of the authors opinions of the racial troubles of the times, woven through the story of Sammy.A not so nice surprise to the readers!"
1,A Truly Boring Story,"It is amazing that a writer could take such an interesting subject like Sammy Davis and make a truly remarkably boring book. There are no Sammy stories that you want to remember much less tell one of your friends about. His two autobiographies were filled with great stories that made you choke up or laugh out loud, this has none of that. It was full of psycho babble that got tedious after awhile. The author's hatred of President Nixon, obvious dislike for Sinatra and misinforming of the ""Archie Bunker"" episode were just a few examples of where this falls woefully short of good reporting and story telling. In addition, I listen to this on an unabridged CD version; the performer was the worse I've ever heard. His gulping sounds took away from a story that could hardly afford any distractions. Bottom line, this is the worse book, that I've finished, that I have ever listen too."
4,"wonderful ideas, but.........","There are plenty of wonderful ideas in this book. But you must know that there are not step by step instructions. If you need some inspiration, then flip through this book and I'm sure you'll be inspired. Although some might say that it is dated (see review below), I think that there are still plenty of fabulous ideas and creativity in here. I would say that because of the lack of instruction and the fact that there isn't alot of information on scrapbooking supplies that it would be geared more towards the ""pro"" scrapper or a very adventurous and confident beginner."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,THIS BOOK IS VERY COMPLETE. FULL OF WONDERFUL IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS. GREAT JOB EXPLAINING PROCEDURES AND DIRECTIONS AND VERY COLORFUL. I HAVE ENJOYED THE BOOK ENOUGH THAT I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FOR MY MOTHER.
3,Where's the fish sauce???,"This book is not bad at all. I have tried several recipes. Some lacked flavor, while a few are reasonably tasty due to the spices used. Generally, the recipes are easy to follow and straight forward. However, I did notice that one of the main ingredients that distinguish Thai (and Vietnamese) food is missing from ALL recipes: Nam Pla or fish sauce. I would recommend this book for its time saving, healthy recipes, but not much for flavors."
1,Over $100 price increase!,"Just a few months ago, these were $83.51 and now they are $184.74! Over a $100 increase. Somebody's gotten greedy."
4,Excellent fly reel,"When I went looking for the ""old-fashioned"" automatic reel, I found this great Pflueger, which is exactly what I wanted! Back in the 1950's, all fly reels were ""automatic"" - thereby allowing a fly fisherman to handle a lot of line in his hands without cranking a spool. Recent ""advancements"" have gone to crank reels, which forces you to use one hand on the rod and the other hand on the reel...leaving no hands free for line-handling."
3,UNDER REVIEW,Didn't work when I recieved reel.. The automatic trigger didn't work.. It was stuck and a little oil solved problem.. Seems to work fine now but I will not know for sure until spring...
2,not even for a beginner,Last item I will buy. Did not work properly.Lesson learned. I will not purchase this brand again. The experience was fantastic.
4,Tons of cheesy fun!,"I'm 14, and all my friends are 15 (I'm young for my grade), but we had so much fun watching this video! We all liked Mary Kate and Ashley when we were younger, so we all happen to know the songs. It's really fun to sing and dance to all the cheesy tunes. The first two are great, but the third is a little bit mediocre. However, I'd recommend this video to any sentimental girl who loves to have fun with friends regardless of what others may think."
1,Parents Warning,"After watching Mary Kate and Ashley sing you will come to think someone scratching nails on a blackboard is a better sound. Your Invited- parties are poorly done- the songs STINK, and sorry Olsen fans- the Olsen twins can't sing! In the end of the first of the parties you really just pity the poor girls- for what a humiliation these tapes must be to them in adulthood.Watching these tapes with my cousins is my form of torture and it's nightmare to endure-- The Costume Party and Ballet Party are their favorites. After half an hour of cheesy songs and costumes you will give up any will to live.This series deserves to be burned buy your child another tape maybe ""Passport To Paris"" or ""Holiday in the Sun"" which are half-way decent and call for a public burning to these tapes.To end the torture of parents..."
2,Poor editing in Kindle edition,"As I pointedly commented in my review of ""The Lions of the North,"" these comments are in regards to the Kindle edition editing and not the story. This 'book' appears to have been created so quickly that little to no editing was done to ensure fidelity to the print edition. For example, there is only one one section break in the text, although there are multiple places throughout where in a print edition either a double return would be used or some other indicator that a new section has started. Other simple-to-correct errors: missing dashes in words, forcing the reader to translate, shifting the focus from the story to the text, spelling errors, and so on. It is quite sad that a publisher has so little respect for their patrons that they willingly produce such poorly done work."
3,Pleasant Formula,"I really enjoy the main characters in this series, but the stories are so similar that I can simply scan the book and get enough of the plot to have my fill. Gervase and Ralph make a great team."
1,Very Misleading,I purchased this CD based on the good reputation of Amazon.com. There is nothing Irish about it! It consists of artists like Tammy Wynette. I feel as if I have been swindled. This would make a good Country & Western Wedding(?) CD but definately not Irish.
5,Pay respect to DD,"A big fan of reggae, I wasn't familiar with Dekker's work although I enjoyed his songs without knowing who sang them! This cd contains a number of classic tunes--Israelites, Shanty Town, I-tek, and Dekker's (excellent) cover of the Jimmy Cliff classic ""You Can Get It..."" Listeners whose point of entry into reggae is Bob Marley or Jimmy Cliff will enjoy this pioneer of the unique Jamaican sound."
4,"BOUNCY, MELODIC REGGAE","This compilation covers some highlights from Desmond Dekker's career that goes right back to the 1960s. It is not comprehensive but contains some of his greatest hits like It Mek and The Israelites that were huge hits. It also displays a variety of styles like ska, rocksteady and bluebeat. My favourites include the aforementioned tracks plus You've Got Your Troubles, Shanty Town, I Believe, Problems and The More You Live. Best Of is a very enjoyable album of tuneful and bouncy songs from one of the greatest Jamaican masters. Another great one is his Greatest Hits collection that I highly recommend."
3,A little Problem...,"Just thought would point out, the other review of this item is incorrect... the Pendulum of recent (dnb)... were formed in 2002 or near abouts in Perth (Australia). Where as the producers of this album were also called Pendulum (a electronic group of the late 90's from Melbourne.. a lso Australia..)Don't want to sound picky, but thought it might mislead people..Ryan"
4,"Good CD, but not the same Pendulum as the new dNb!","This CD is great for lots of reasons. First, it's different... not too much of this laid back breakbeat; least that I've heard. It's very listenable without becoming too repetitive.But yes, this is NOT the same Pendulum as the newer dNb stuff (Hold your Colour, etc)."
2,ha!,"i almost liked this band, then i saw them preform. oh heavens...i was soooo embarrassed for them (namely the singer) that i had to leave. yeeee. i would describe it as a bunch of high school kids who try a bit too hard. but some stuff does stand out such as their obvious influence from the refused. so i say buy it as long as you are not easily embarrassed."
4,Difinitely original....,This album took a couple times listening through to understand their style and originality..... but once you do you won't be upset. This one's definitely a keeper and will be in your collection for a long time.
5,One of the best horse books,"Even before horses had captured me in their enthralling spell, I loved this book. Now I'm 12, and I still love it. Susan Jeffer's wonderful art allows the little girl and the various horses, to be tranformed into my pony and I, dancing across flowers..."
5,Memorial,"This book is beautiful, every little girl should have this book read to them. My parents used read this book to me often before I went to sleep. My dreams were peaceful safe. I have wonderful memories of this book!"
2,Its just OK.,"The wifi detector part of this unit works without issue and I guess that is its main function however, the bluetooth detector does not work AT ALL!! I have placed a bluetooth enabled transmitting phone next to the device and it was not detected.My other major problem was with the clasp. I had the unit attached to a laptop bag and right in the middle of an airport the clasp broke. Luckily some nice person informed me and I was able to pick up the unit.My suggestion, go with another device."
1,Pathetic,"This thing does a horrible job at detecting wifi networks. I have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50% signal (even though I can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection). If it does detect Bluetooth, which half the time it doesn't (regardless of it being active), it cancels out the wifi detection. So if you have a bluetooth headset, and you're talking, the thing will just let you know that yes, there is a bluetooth device around. Thanks. I was wondering."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"The WiFi Finder Plus is not what I had hoped for. I used my notebook all over a local sandwich shop with excellent signal strength. The Finder said the signal was medium to nonexistant. The same is true for my home wireless network. The Finder gave a much lower signal strength than the notebook indicated. (Oh, and the included flashlight on mine is practically unuseable. The button that activates it is tight and difficult to use.) Anyway, I plan on keeping it for use on trips. I guess if I get a signal at all with the Finder, it will be a good place to use the notebook."
1,no good,This wifi finder can't even find a signal in the same room with a transmitter. Don't waste your money or time on this device. Opening your notbook computer is less costly.
1,wifinder,"The Kensington wifi hot spot finder is useless. It doe not work. I have another one from IOGEAR. It gave a ""strongest"" reading while the Kensington said there was no wifi available. It's junk!"
1,Not worth the money...,"This is the first 'finder' I've ever tried using, so I'm hoping that there are others out there that actually work. For one thing, this product is supposed to locate Bluetooth networks, and it has NEVER worked for me, even right next to my laptop. It also reports that my WiFi network strength is lower than it actually is, again according to the software on my laptop. So if you plan on using this while you wander around 'looking' for WiFi networks, forget about it. If you aren't within about 5 feet of the network's base station, then you'll never see it with the Kensington WiFi Finder Plus. Save your money, this product is not worth the money."
1,Waste of time and money,"My father has one and loves it, but I can't imagine how many signals he must be missing if he can actually find *one* anywhere.I have been online for hours in places where the wi-fi finder can't detect a signal. I thought mine was defective so I exchanged it and got the same results. The only place it ever found a signal was in the store itself. I'm going to return this one for good this time."
4,"Overall good performance, but specific uses.","The Kensington WiFi Finder Plus is a solid performer and does what I needed it for. I've never tried the built in BlueTooth Finder, but that's simply because I've never used any BlueTooth devices.Regardless, the WiFi Finder is not going to give you as powerful signal as your wireless device. If you get one LED to light up on this keychain, it can equal about 3-4 bars. 2 LEDs for me equates to a full 5 bars on my laptop typically. This is not foolproof, however, as at times it will show no signal at all given its lack of power, when it is quite possible to connect.Basically, it is a good product if you're looking to see if you're in or in close proximity to a hotspot, but not necessarily for if you're driving or walking past somewhere and wish to know if you'll have wireless connectivity inside. Buy it for specific uses but don't expect it to show signals like your laptop will."
1,Kensington wants to sell you a lemon.,"Kensington WiFi Finder does not work as advertised at all. I wasted and enormous amount of time looking for hot spots using this device at school and at work, it failed to detect every single hot spot I visited in public areas. I even tested inside the first Public Library to ever introduce WiFi in Southern California and it failed to detect a WiFi signal that is strong enough to fry your brain. This device reminds me a lot of those old police radar detectors that some speeders place on their dashboards, it simply does not work. Don't buy it, don't waste your money. Mine has been returned already. Read the other reviews and you will see that this is not an isolated incident."
1,Did not work as advertised,"Wouldn't detect or indicate WiFi location, even when siting on top of a known good site."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT,"How can I rate a product that I never received? All other Calaca Zaffrano items ordered at the same time were received. No complaints about any of them. However, the 5-piece pasta serving set was never delivered. I have since placed another order for it--2 weeks ago--still no word."
1,DON'T BUY UNLESS!!!!,"I bought this movie 4 my children thinking that it was going to be cute classics. And well they are but from the 60s! Oh my! the pics are hoorible and the sound! they even included a tv show about christmas. cartoons then allow a lot of violence, not to mention the extreme poor quality!"
1,"Not what its ""cut"" out to be!","I always hated using the vegetable peeler to peel potatoes...until I bought this product that is! I was excited when I purchased the item, expecting it to live up to what the box said it was. After several minutes, the first potato was still not peeled & I was wore out. My husband and I found that we could use the vegetable peeler much faster. We tried them a few times just to make sure it was the product and not us.As for it looking like aqarium rocks, I agree it does resemble aquarium rocks. However, an owner of a kitchen gadget store said we could just make the gloves ourselves...buy the latex gloves for cleaning, spray them with glue & then put in fresh clean cat liter. He said that closer to what they are actually made of...So if you really want to try them, I recommend his solution & save your money.I would definately return mine if I could. They are a complete waste of money!"
2,tater mitts,"I ordered 5 sets of these for christmas presents. They were delivered in good time and good condition - however, no one was particularly happy with them. The presentations seen on t.v. made no mention (that any of us had seen) that the potatoes have to be boiled before you can peel them using the mitts. My grandson tried to peel a raw potato and the mitts came apart.Not happy with the product..."
1,Absolutely worthless; waste of money!,These things do not work as advertised. It takes way too much strength and constant pressure on the potatoes to get any type of result.The blue things glued to the gloves come off all over the place and make a mess. The gloves are impossible to clean without removing even more of the blue things (which are what supposedly make them work in the first place).I went back to a good course brush. These gloves are a farce!
5,Tater Mitts,These are a replacement for my worn out tater mitts from a few years ago. I use tater mitts routinely.I was very pleased with the speed of the sellers shipping and cost. I would recommend use of this seller.
1,Disaster,When this product came the box was destroyed. I had to tape it to try to make it look better as it was a Christmas gift! When it was opened the egg cutter that was advertised to be included was not! What a horrible experience this was!
1,better than the girl bratz babyz,"See, I don't like Cameron at all, but at least he is wearing pants that cover up everything. But he is not fun at all. I played with him for about 1 day, then he sat under my bed for about a week and then my mother found it and gave it to the thrift store for some other girl to dwell over for about a day.The girls are much cutier, but over all, all the genders of bratz babyz are butt-ugly! Esp. since the girl's skirt barely covers up her butt. Yet again, I liked Camron more than I liked Cloe and both of them ended up at the thrift store after collecting dust under my bed."
1,sooooo weird,This toy is so weird I can't believe they actually made bratz babyz boyz I mean it is so bad.On the bratz website it didn't even say that they were coming out with this.They just started to sell the girls and it doesn't even make sense to make babyz boyz.The girls are way better and they are the main bratz.Buh bye you guys who buy the babyz boyz are weird!
5,i love him,i wish i had him if you do not like it.do not buy it i hate all you that say hes bad looking hes so soooooooooooooo cute i want him.
3,"Decent book, disappointing ending.","I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the Second Demonwars Saga, and I understand if Salvatore had to tie the Demon Dactyl into the story somehow.That did not make the ending of this story any better. For one thing, the ending is much too neat; no major characters die (at least not for a long while) other than a few bad guys, and the most fascinating character of the second trilogy, Aydrian (who is interesting in the sense that he is a combination of ambition, ruthlessness, and the skills of the Tou'Alfar) gets off the hook in a profoundly unsatisfactory manner.It was almost like Salvatore was faced with the difficult choice of having to resolve the dilemma of Jilseponie being forced to fight in opposition and potentially kill her only son (who is also her living tie to Elbryan), and just decided to dodge the issue with a cop-out. Very disappointing, especially considering that the end of the First Demonwars Trilogy was so good."
1,Tedious,"The author clearly set out to write an ""epic"" instead of a good story. Really unpleasant, no likeable characters."
4,Everything must end...,"The last book of the series was entertaining. As I have mentioned in some of my other reviews, the last 4 books were not up to the level of the first 3 in this series. It was good to see how things wrapped up, and this book was better than some of the others in the second demon wars saga, but again not amazing."
5,Great movie!,This is a great look into one child's experience with slavery. It seems so real. It's very educational to young children.
5,Sugar Cane Alley,"Euzhan Palcy's warm, deeply felt film about mentorship and sacrifice is a life-affirming experience, and springs from autobiographical roots. Palcy recreates the plantation life with a keen sense of balance, offsetting the squalid conditions of workers with an authentic feeling of community and the innocence of childhood. All the central players are superb, particularly Cadenat and Legitimus. Another hidden gem."
2,Not good for heavy people.,My husband weighs 271 pounds and the first time he used this bath bench the top of the plastic seat crushed inwards. This bench also seems a bit shaky and unstable. For large people I recommend the Drive 12011KD-1 which lasted over 4 years until he snapped the back off by pushing against it too hard.
4,Black erotic passion and love,"This book was a joy to read. You could open it up anywhere in the book and find a wonderful erotic story or poem to read. From the sheer passion and love of ""A Dinner Invitation"" to the sexy fun of ""Sexy Signs"". I can't understand why we don't see more books by black authours writing erotica."
2,Thought it was a peice of junk.,Thought it was a peice of junk.Thought it was a peice of junk. Thought it was a peice of junk.
4,"Hot, Hot, Hot",This book was hot. It provided an avenue for us to share one of the most intimate of actions. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to spice up an intimate episode or for anyone that wants to practice independent sex acts and needs some assistance.
2,"Okay, but not that hot!","There are about two stories in this collection that I would say are great. The rest of them are so-so. I've read a lot of erotica, but this just doesn't get my blood boiling."
1,This book Sucks,"After reading Zane, This book does not even come close. It is so bland and boring.Maybe I need to spend some time with it but I am not impressed."
2,Way less than expected!!!,Noise and noise. Disappointed by the fact that spa neither heat the water nor keep it warm if you add hot water.
3,"Its nice, good deal, free shipping was great","it works good i like the pedicure attachments, we add ice to the water instead of using the heat function"
4,Excellent introduction to Jung,"This provided an excellent introduction to Jung for me (a lay person) but it could use a pointer to some follow-up at the end. It leaves the reader with the thought: ""Where do I proceed from here?"", directly into the mass of Jung's works?"
4,Even Without Burton Cummings this one really rocks,"I took a chance and bought this one on vinyl in 1979 when it first came out. I was very pleasantly surprised since Burton Cummings does not appear on this one. (I am still a big Cummings fan) Former members Jim Kale and Don McDougal reformed this band and put together an album of straight-up rock and roll. Sweet Young Thing and Taxman are the real gems on this CD. McDougal's voice comes through loud and clear and makes one wonder what might have happened on some of the Guess Who's ""middle period"" mediocre albums had he been given more vocals. Put your CD player on ""Continuous Play,"" start the CD on track #6 and let 'er go!!"
4,good prarie pop,"this band had some very good, solid tunes...more rock oriented than ballad oriented, songs like ""moonwave maker"", ""taxman"", and ""rasin hell on the praries"" are first rate. ""all this for a song"", tells the listener, yes we will play our old tunes, but these new tunes are what we are about. excellent playing by a band not allowed to reach it""s full potential. if you do not wnt anything new, stick with greatest hits cd."
1,DON'T ATTEND ON GETTING THIS CD ALBUM IT'S TOO LISTENABLE!,"The worst even more just like their other album called ""Lonely One"". Because of their new lead vocalist and just listening to it does'nt sound great for any classic rock Guess Who fan i'd remember here with any original members and the old lead singer Burton Cummings performing on this CD here cause of different bandmembers joined The Guess Who in my opinion!"

5,Childhood Memories Recaptured,Back in the 60's I lived in Georgia. Schools were not air conditioned and the afternoons were quiet and sultry. My teacher would read us Swampy and Babs every day after lunch. It was the best part of my day. Finding this book on Amazon recaptured that magical time for me. I'm surprised this charming book of childhood adventure has not become a classic. It certainly means more to me than any other book I experienced before I was ten.
3,aromaless,"I'm not allergic to anything, I just don't like smelly soaps, afta shaves, shampoos, etc. So I tried this. It's ok, no noticeable odor, but no foaming bubbles, either, so no sense of getting clean, although it does. I'm one of those guys with hair in retreat formation, thinning, and I'm not fastidious, but even with no aroma I'd like some suds, or whatever. So I'll try another, but keep this one as a reserve."
3,I loose my hair more and more after using DHS shampoo,"My hair is very sensitive to any shampoo existing on the market. I tried many brands. I found that is most safest is Nioxin scalp cleanser (shampoo), but it dries my hair. To make my hair shiny I use Nioxin scalp therapy(conditioner). My research helped my to find out that the Zinc brakes hair roots and Sulfate makes hair dry and fuzzy."
4,camo dog carrier,"This is a really nice product. Regretfully, though my pet, jack russell terrier mix, is only 15 pounds, but she is too tall (long)for it to fit comfortably. we were very hopeful - may not find one to fit her."
1,Terrible bag...unless your dog is super small!!,"I bought this bag and thought my 12 pound dog would be a perfect fit, I was so disappointed when he would only fit in sideways! I had to send it back for a return....I bought a great bag from chimpfeet.com that my dog loves so we will just have to stick with that one!!"
3,beware this is a OLDE book,"This is a great resource for introductory information on how amazon web sales WORKED back in 2005!It is out dated information and the API they talk about isn't the one currently used. The methods to utilize amazon merchant features are also outdated.Don't buy this book, they must have a newer version available or buy someone elses book on amazon marketing.I would have returned it if I could have, as I said it is filled with interesting information....unfortunately it is grossly out of date and in computer programming interfaces that means...it is near worthless."
1,Video was more advertisement,For the cost of the DVD I did not want to then endure a continuous series of basic infomercials. DVD was not user friendly at all.
