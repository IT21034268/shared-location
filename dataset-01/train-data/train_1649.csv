4,China made for USA company. 609 is mostly FAUX metal colored plastic and not metal,"The side of the 609 slicer box leads you to believe it is made in the USA, however MADE IN CHINA is posted on the bottomof the box. The misleading Amazon description states the 609 is mostly made of stainless steel and aluminum. Truly, metalcan only be found in the cutting blade, and a small covering of metal is on the sliding tray that holds the food, and perhapssome nuts and bolts.The plus side for all the FAUX 'metal colored plastic' is that this slicer is lightweight.Disassembling is pretty easy and necessary to lubricate the plastic gears, as well as to clean the unit. The slider tray is thehigh point with an easy gliding and controlled motion for slicing. I have used this slicer to cut chilled homemade summer sausage and it performed well."
4,A very good home slicer,"This is not a heavy duty commercial deli machine by any means, but I have found it to be a very good home slicer. I have used it for pepperoni, salami, and Iberico ham, and it whizzes through them providing uniform slices of any thickness selected in no time. It also thinly slices French baguettes quickly and uniformly. Perfect tool in preparing hors d'oeuvres in quantity. Bought one at $79. Went back to buy another six months later, and they were $99. Waiting for a sale."
4,Hard to slice,I agree with Mimi - as you are slicing the thickness changes. Also with the serrated blade you really have to push the meat against it. I think I will order the smooth blade. I had a hard time slicing corned beef and ham - couldn't get the slices thin enough for sandwiches. Otherwise the slicer is great and easy to clean.
4,I put my finger top into...,"To start the review, I recently sliced my index finger top into it, and it was immediately almost ""chopped off"" before I pulled back.Well, as all the other reviews it is a great product for slicing common food. And I am sorta abusing it by slicing the frozen lamb with this slicer pretty often for making authentic hotpot. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is NOT because of my finger top but is really about the smoky smell it produces when starting. What I am trying to describe is that in the first one or two minutes after starting, the motor seems to be burning something inside and produces a very unpleasant smell. However, it only lasts for the first one minute or two and quickly goes away afterwards."
4,Ok slicer for price,"Good slicer for the price,only complaint is that when pushing food against knife blade it moves by itself and changes the thickness I chose."
1,This was not as advertised,This was the the stainless steel advertised. Place that touched the food being sliced were plastic and very light weight. I would not recommend this. I will be looking for a slicer with stainless parts where it touches the food.
1,Returned after 3 uses for refund,This product is made almost entirely of plastic. It cannot withstand 3 uses in 1 month before breaking. Beware. It is not capable of producing consistent deli-thin slices even with the optional blade. Cleanup is near impossible as the device does not come completely apart from the electrical motor.
4,Jerky slicer.,"I purchased this slicer with the intention of using it to slice meat for making jerky, but I haven't been able to start the project yet. I did use it to slice a beautiful ham for our New Year's Eve party and it did a really good job."
5,Slicer,"I just ordered this slicer, don't have it yet. After reading the reviews I decided to order the non-serrated blade for another $30.00. Really begs the question of why the manufacturer doesn't produce it with the proper blade. It's advertised as a meat slicer, but apparently you will not get good results with the blade supplied. Makes you go hmmmm?Had it awhile now, this slicer is awesome. You don't really need the other blade, the one supplied works fine. It's not perfect, but it doesn't cost $6500.00 either. If you slice, you can't go wrong here, it's a five star slicer!!!!!Don't know why the star rating is one, I selected 5, Amazon issue I guess... Well worth the money ....."
2,Would have had 4 stars before it quit,"I really enjoyed having this appliance around and it saved me a bunch of money and very convenient and workable for the tasks I had to accomplish. It was a bit slow going, but it's not a commercial model, so that wasn't a big thing. Up till a few months ago, I would have given this thing 4 stars and strongly recommended buying it to anyone that asked.Then during one short use, it got very warm quickly and started screeching like an alley cat. Thinking something got lodged, I took it apart and examined and cleaned it thoroughly. Upon putting it back together, the motor simply started humming, and it simply quit. The motor had simply fried.I've known one other person who had the same issue and I've seen it here as well. Admittedly, this was not an expensive appliance, but neither is it used even weekly. To only last 18 months is a bit of a short life in my opinion, and reflective of a less than stellar parts list."
3,The Beet Fields by Gary Paulsen,"David is a 16 year old boy who grows to be a man over one summer. He runs from home and from his mother, a drunk. He finds work on a few beet fields and makes Mexican friends. Then he ventures tobe a carny. He finds his true self and his true manhood. I liked the book because I can relate to David. I liked the way the book flows. David is a good character choice for the Beet Fields."
3,Beware of offensive language and subject matter,"This is a glimpse into Paulsen's 16th summer, when he left his drunken parents to pursue life on his own. He takes work as a laborer in the beet fields where he befriends Mexican workers and learns to hunt pigeons with his bare hands, and later does farm work, joins the crew of a traveling carnival, and learns about lust from an older, much more experienced woman.This book should be limited to mature readers because of the detailed sexual encounter and the language typical of the people Paulsen associated with during that summer. By ""mature readers"", I mean ones that will not circle offensive language or mark up the book in any other way because of it."
1,inappropriate,"Although previous titles by Gary Paulsen were enjoyed, this title is inappropriate for young teenage readers. It is sensual only to be provocative and titillating like a Harlequin romance. Hardly redeeming content. Disappointing. If I could give zero stars, I would."
2,A boy becomes a man!,"I had to read ""The beet fields"" for school (for our book talk in english). I think Gary Paulsen book's are sometimes boring. It's a typical story about a boy who becomes a man. On his way he has to make a lot of hard decisions and he learns a lot about different characters of people. I don't like such books. I prefer books with a historic background. Daniela Kammerl√§nder!"
5,A novel with a pulse!,"I just read this short novel in two sittings and LOVED it. The Beet Fields, by Gary Paulsen, is about growing up and becoming a man, and takes you to this mental place with raw, vivid details and beautiful language. The story is gritty and provocative, and follows ""The Boy"" through a crazy, random summer that never ceased to capture my interest and awe. Written completely from the heart, his sentences sang out to me and I read them aloud and laughed aloud, just sitting here reading them alone in the corner of my living room. Literary comparisons to Tobias Wolff, Hemingway, and even Gertrude Stein came to mind as I read this. I want more! Thank you Gary Paulsen. (Check out his website, too. What a cool, prolific man.)"
3,Beat Fields,"Beat Fields: Memories of a Sixteenth Summer by Gary Paulsen is an exciting story about a teenage boy who runs away from his home. Beatfields takes place in the 1950's in North Dakota. Throughout the book, the boy is constantly on the run. He learns a lot from the people he meets and works for.I enjoyed this book because something new and exiteing is always happening! I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys Gary Paulsen's writing."
3,"Good, but does NOT have two ""always on"" outlets","I ordered this surge protector mainly because the description on Amazon's site (at least at the time) said that it has two ""always on"" outlets, and the others can be turned off at the switch. I really like the layout of the outlets and the space it has for so many plugs, and I like that it has a light that shows you if something's wrong with the wall outlet you're plugging it into, but it does NOT have the always on outlets. I will keep the surge protector because it's a good one, but will be looking for another one that does what I hoped this one would."
5,Well-designed,"This surge protector is designed well, so you don't waste two outlets to plug in an AC adapter. It also has two outlets that are always on, so you can turn off your computer equipment at the switch without having your lights go out.Downsides: It's a bit expensive, and it wastes a bit more power than other surge protectors, even when it's turned off."
1,It does NOT have two 'always on'.,Contrary to the description.How can they make such a glaring error?I need more words to meet the minimum.
2,Does not support cat 5,This is advertised as protecting data. I just got this and it does not have anywhere to plug in cat 5. Oh well.
3,Misleading Listing,"This CD has 6 play along songs for the book of the same title and that is it. It is WAY over priced and the use of (BOX SET) is totally bogus and misleading. Even the author suggests that you not buy it. The Complete Modern Drumset Book and DVD are EXCELLENT 4 star reviews in Modern Drummer and considered ""must have"" by Modern Drummer Magazine."
4,Saki is wonderful,"Saki's sardonic insight and exquisite sense of irony don't work quite as perfectly in a novel or play as when contained in a short story, but nonetheless this is a wonderful book and well worth reading."
5,Wonderful performance,"Okay, Fred. Here`s a review. Better late than never, eh?This little-known symphony has not been given its proper recognition over the years compared to Dvorak`s other later symphonies.However, Dohnanyi proudly demonstrates the opulence and pastoral beauty of this work by giving a fantastic rendition with the always-dependable Cleveland players.Decca`s sound is near-perfect as usual.If you are a devotee of this symphony, this performance is not to be missed."
2,"I really, really wanted to like this book","I had just finished reading ""The Scarlet Letter"" for the third time when I saw the review for this book, a follow-up telling the fate of Pearl. I immediately bought it(though it was hard to find..no local bookstore carried it, so I had to buy it on-line). Anyway, enthusiastically as I approached it, I found it very slow going. The author seems to take a lot of liberties with the original story (though, in her defense, she also seems to try to explain away these inconsistancies at the end of her book). I really struggled to make it through the whole thing. I did, and it was not without its rewards, but the parts were definitely better than the whole. Still, I will definitely read the author's next book. She's very insightful and serious and an excellent stylist."
1,tedious,"I have to admit that I'm not a huge Scarlet Letter fan. I've only read it once so that might have colored my opinion a little. But I mostly found this book tedious. It meanders through plot and character. The conflict seems elusive: is it with Pearl's mother? father? friend? husband? herself? The story seemed to be a muddled effort to tell a tale and a historical novel.The one saving grace-the author has a most mysterious way with words. She crafts some very beautiful prose so then when reading you suddenly find yourself 50 pages down the line. The reading can be very easy and smooth like that for a while. But not for the entire story. Her eloquence is fleeting and you find yourself trying to get through confusing dialogue and half explained situations.*I recieved this book as an ARC and did not pay for it, though that did not influence my opinion"
5,"LIFE CHANGING BOOK IF YOU HAVE FATIGUE, OR FIBRO","Excellent book by specialized MD, nutritionist, herbalist. Explains how to heal the adrenals, which put out cortisol and other vital hormones. Low cortisol is probably the biggest cause of fatigue syndrome, and firbomyalgia, among other people problems. Even has questionaire, so you can find out if your adrenals are not functioning. Heal by diet and suppliments."
1,A Waste of Money,"This book is a waste of time and money. If you are tired, most likely you have looked at a variety of causes such as what you are eating, stress in your life, lack of exercise, blah blah blah. You already know about the benefits of eating right, relaxation, and eliminating stress. There is nothing new here except, maybe, a note about 2-3 vitamins known to address the adrenal system. But you could probably find that online.THEN, to add insult to injury, near the back 1/3 of the book he provides two ""sure fire"" tests to tell you if you have adrenal fatique. Well, duh? Why not put those in the beginning so you know if you are even on the right track. And of course, my results from the tests were negative. I'd be surprised to hear of anyone who had a positive result on these tests which would give the test some credibility.Except for those two tests, I could have written this book myself from my own reading over the years and from watching Oprah.Save your money. I wish I had mine back."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Not only is this book unscientific, unprofessional and bizarre, it also has an odd, moralistic slant to it. The many drawings and graphs in the book are simply ""bad"", i.e. talentless and sloppy. The data references are mostly 50 to 90 years old! I can't believe the book was actually published. Don't waste your time and money."
1,Hard to read...,"This may be an excellent book and may have wonderful advice. However, it is so painfully boring that I haven't been able to actually read it."
4,How to reverse the results of stress,"This book is about a serious condition affecting millions, but which is generally not recognized by doctors.Adrenal fatigue is caused by stress of any kind, physical, emotional, psychological, etc. etc. or various combinations of these.James Wilson explains the syndrome in great detail - the cause, symptoms and treatment. A comprehensive questionnaire that can help you determine whether you yourself suffer from the condition is included.Though it can be severe, adrenal fatigue can absolutely be reversed by following the author's directions as regards lifestyle and dietary changes and by taking specific dietary supplements.This is an important book for all those subjected to stress, which is most of us, and who are likely to suffer from this syndrome."
3,Questionaire,I would definitely enjoy this book more in a regular hard or soft back. Taking the questionnaire is impossible on my Kindle. I definitely found the book right on!
4,Stress Fatigue...,"This is a very informative book, but I still dont know if adrenal fatigue is a real illness or not, or just a symptom of chronic worry and stress. I had a lot on my plate every day and did'nt have the ability to take even a day off. Which causes stress even into the night and in the morning its the first thing I thought about. When I stopped worrying, The fatigue lessened. Along with this book Invisible Valium & feel the fear do i anyway were very helpful."
5,Truly Needed,"This book comprehensively addresses this condition, a condition that is likely more widespread than acknowledged. Much is written about stress and high cortisol but little is available on the symptoms that occur when your adrenals are exhausted and there is little cortisol. Even most conventional doctors know little about this condition nor how to treat it. Having been finally diagnosed (after probably 14 years of walking around with varying degrees of adrenal fatigue), I've used this book as a guide to healing naturally and selecting a doctor who really knew how to address this condition. This book appropriately managed my expectations as to how slowly I would heal and helped me identify much-needed lifestyle changes."
4,Lots of Information,This book is great. It gave you so much information. By the end of the book you can see if this book applies to you or not. This book covers everything so you can make a decision if this is you.People have many illness that doctors can't seem to explain. This is one of them.
3,A little Disappointed,"I got the book and started reading right away. It does contain a lot of information that was helpful. Although it listed the foods to eat and not eat, I felt it should have given a sample menu to use as a guide. I really felt the discription was not accurate enough, had it been, I may or may not have made the purchase."
1,Snake Oil,"This book has some good common-sense advice about stress and the damage it can do to the body. For that, I considered giving a second star.However, this is interspersed with the worst kind of snake-oil-salesmanship. The medical community ignores this issue! Only I have the answer! Buy stuff from my website to be cured!I decided against the second star for the tidbits of good info because I fear the rest of the book may be actively harmful to some people who take it seriously.Please note: I have nothing against herbal or alternative treatments which have been shown to be effective. And yes, there are issues that many doctors are not as aware of as perhaps they should be -- that's unavoidable given the amount of medical information there is for them to keep up with these days. But this is NOT a book that deals with these issues in a sensible manner."
4,Helpful tips and hints,"I have not read this book from cover to cover, but it is very helpful figuring out how to handle this situation."
5,Adrenal fatigue information,An amazing book that explains how stress can exacerbate auto-immune diseases and over worked adrenal function.Chronic fatigue due to adrenal exhaustion need not be a mystery.
4,worth reading again,"I really think this book has a lot of good information. It is worth taking the time to read it. Study it, and really get to know the topic. It has expalined a lot about the stress induced problems affecting people today."
4,Adrenal Fatique,So many people should read this book. We are all under so much pressure and stress and have no idea what we are doing to the inside of our bodies. this book explains how important it is to have healthy adrenal function. I was amazed at the impact the adrenals have on your health. Very enlightnening !! I am now on my way to recovery .... feeling so much better.
2,convoluted and simplisitic,It's a very simplistic book for a newby to health and approaches to getting well. It's redundant and overly long to get to the point of how to get well.
5,Great book,"Author claims he waited for others to write the book but had to because he knew more than anyone else and no one was going to write it. Very important stuff, claims adrenal fatigue is epidemic, but complete causes are not fully known yet. Blames sugar which may be, some, but for someone who has been trying to eat healthy for 20 years, it got me too. Maybe GMO's? Maybe other toxins/ chemicals in foods? Flouride? Lots of potential littering our environment now."
4,More theory please :),Personally I would have wanted a book which was more theoretical so one of the last chapters made my day!! But all in all an important book and topic.
5,Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome,"This is an informative, easy-to-read book about a very widespread yet infrequently diagnosed condition. I was 'hooked' when I read the 9 questions on the back cover; tiredness, cravings, stressed, depressed... I am reading it aloud with my husband! I ordered it 'slightly used' and was not disappointed in the condition of the book. It came in on time and cost less than half of what I saw it for at the pharmacy.Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome"
4,"Review of ""Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome""","The quiz in this book is very helpful for diagnosing adrenal fatigue. He also very clearly breaks down the biology of the adrenal gland and helps you understand where your symptoms are coming from. While scientific in nature, the language is not too complex for someone outside of the medical profession to understand.My only negative critique of this book is that it was not well edited and, especially towards the end, there are lots of grammatical/punctuation errors."
5,What a help!,"This book puts all the pieces together for a condition the three doctors I'd been to had no idea about. Most helpful to me were the test of whether you have the condition and the dietary suggestions. Not eating fruit in the morning and eating more salt, etc., have made a huge difference for me. The book is a bit old and could use some updating, but definitely worth getting if you suspect your adrenal glands are out of whack."
3,Once Again,"Once again a person with PHD's tries to convince us that, yes, allopathic medicine doesn't work, but please buy his supplements. Adrenal dysfunction can be the sign of many imbalances, as one reviewer stated, and though some believe this is a good starting point, I would caution them. Get to the cause of the adrenal exhaustion, rather than just treating the adrenals. Read ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" first, then move onto ""specialist"" books that may add some additional ""tweaking."""
1,educate yourself first,"Before you waste too much time on Dr. Wilson's ideas, do yourself a favor & check out his accredited opponents at Wikipedia's adrenal fatigue page.Review of:Adrenal Fatigue: The 21st Century Stress Syndrome"
2,Poor Packaging,"The lid to the spray was taped on with packaging tape. When I took the tape off, it took all of the silver decorative lining off the cap. This was a gift that was last minute so I didn't have time to return it. I had to replace the lid with one I had from another product. Oh, and I smelled it and thought it was stinky. Guess Lily of the Valley is a personal preference."
2,"good info, horrible design","While the book is very informative and the images of the products themselves are excellent, the graphic design and typograhy are absolutely horrible and amateurish. Hideous, gaudy, psychedelic backgrounds on the pages completely detract from the images of the Wacky Packages. The typeography is awful with small type running across the full width if the page, into the center binding, with no columns to make for easier reading. They seem to use about 50 different fonts. The pages are crammed and cluttered. It's a shame. I plan on returning mine before it has a chance to fall apart. A much cleaner layout would really help this book."
1,Not a Catholic interpretation!,"This book is researched from primarily (if not entirely) Protestant sources. It is not an orthodox Catholic view nor is it researched with authentically Catholic sources such as the church fathers, saints etc. I cannot recommend it."
3,Recommended...,"Luckily i saw the preview, because i really taught this would be anothermurder/killing movie, but was pleasantly surprise as it tells a prettysolid story involving a tatoo artist and the problems that arise oncehe steals a tool possesed by a evil spirit...Good for a keeper."
3,A little freaky,Honestly I bought this movie because I was watching Roswell on Netflix and was interested it other work that he had done. So I typed his name in and this popped up. I honestly (at 26 years old) got a little freaked out the night I finished it. Between this movie and the book I was reading I couldn't go to sleep until my husband came home. lol I know I'm a dork. I think the movie could have been a little better but it was still good.*****Spoiler alert!***************I love how like one of the 1st scenes you see his butt.
5,"Surprised, I really enjoyed it.","I was pleasantly surprised. I LOVED this movie. So glad I bought it, Jason Behr was amazing!"
3,new idea,It was a fresh idea for a movie. If you like something different this would be one for you.
2,The Tattooist,"The DVD itself was in excellent condition with no skips or scratches. However, this movie by far is not Jason Behr's best work. I much preferred him on Roswell. In any case, the premise of a cursed tattoo instrument is, to say the least, lame. The script was not lukewarm and undeserving of the JB's talents. The sign of a great movie is that you would watch it again sometime in the future. That's not going to happen here. I'm not blaming the actors, just the brain trust that came up with the dumb idea."
5,Even if you're only thinking about buying a Leica.....,"Osterloh really knows his Leicas and it shows in this book. Not only does he know them, he also knows how to use them.Unlike some others ""how to"" books, this one contains good, up-to-date photos that illustrate the points the author is trying to make.In addition to covering the technical aspects of the Leica M system, the author goes into the practical aspects of using it.Although a former Leica employee, Osterloh is not a shill for the company. He's not afraid to give honest opinions and, when an M isn't the best camera for a given situation, he'll say so.I only bought into the M system a little over a year ago so I'm far from an authority. However, even with 30 years photographic experience under my belt, I learned a few things from this book.Highly recommended for anyone owning a Leica M, thinking about buying one or just plain interested in good photography."
3,New pix please!!,"It is a heartwarming volume for Leica users, gives a meticulously detailed history of the brand and lots of info of particular models -- bodies, lenses, accessories. The section on how to photograph with a Leica though is truly a let-down. Like a basic teach yourself book on making sense of f-stops, focal length and shutter speed, illustrated with painfully mediocre and outdated snapshots. Way below Leica territory. I mean, c'mon! Half the world's best classic art photographs were made with Leicas, from Besson to Nan Golding, or even lesser masters, there's plenty of stuff to choose from. It would be worth an updated 3rd edition with totally new pictures, and of course the M8 included."
1,Graphic and disappointing,"If you are looking for a good story, characters and plot...look elsewhere. When I looked at the description of this book on amazon.com, it mentioned nothing about it just being a smut novel. I like a good romantic scene now and then, but this is full of graphic sex that frankly gets ridiculous. If you enjoy explicit descriptions of sexual acts, then this is for you. I feel I wasted good money on this book and won't be buying more from this author."
4,Very interesting,"There are so many characters that you may have trouble following who is who, but it was a wonderful read. The scenes were sexy and hot. YOu will really enjoy this one."
3,Nice!,"I liked the plot as much as the others, but my favorite of the series is still The master of Wolves. Liked the heroine better."
1,How can anyone call this romance?!,"I love fantasy novels - witches, vampires, magic, other worlds, you name it. So I was intrigued with the idea of a parallel Earth/Mageverse Universe. But I was also expecting a paranormal romance story. Unfortunately, the repetitive use of locker-room descriptions of everything sexual killed any idea of romance, and also killed any possibility of enjoyment of this story for me. I have read sensual and romantic, but I didn't find any of that here.Unlike the reviewer who stopped after 50 pages, I persevered to the end, in spite of my distaste for the coarse and vulgar language that accompanied every sexual encounter. Then I did something I thought I would never, ever do - I threw it in the trash."
3,An Okay Read,"I was very excited to read this book because of the positive reviews. I must say, I wasn't disppointed, but I wasn't very impressed. I think it was the plot concept that made this book a little dry for me. I think between ""Magverse"" and the fairies, Merlin, vampires, demons, witches, the round table, alien references, and humans, I found it to be just a little too much going on. But the author did a great job trying to make it work, it just fell kind of flat for me....at times I found the the book moving a little slow. There were some nice light hearted scenes in the book that got a chuckle out of me which I was hoping would continue throughout the book, but it didn't."
5,Great Author/ Great Storyline!!,"I loved it!!! I read many, many, many, vampire, regular romance and paranormal books and I found the world that Angela Knight created new and exciting. Anyone looking for a new and refreshing book that is not the same old vampire romance will LOVE these books. The romance/sex is quite steamy from most of the books I have read in the past, but not out of place in the story.I did notice there are a few reviewers who took this as an opportunity to try to convince, either the readers or themselves, I'm not sure who, that their far superior intellect had a problem with the method of changing over a latent female (although they fail to acknowledge that the hero himself was turned the same way and left with a broken heart). My advice, get over it, your reading paranormal romance for christmas sake!! If you want a thought provoking read, perhaps a change is in order."
3,Didn't work :(,This was a replacement battery for my mom's phone and sad to say it didn't work :( Really did not want to have to teach her how to use a new cell phone but this phone is dead. Also bought a new replacement charger and that did not help....guess the phone is just too old
2,Broke immediately,"This is a good idea, but it broke the first time I used it. The little threaded insert that holds the set screw for the tensioners stripped right away. Without the tensioners, you might as well just load line straight off the spool."
2,Quality Issue,I purchased the Berkley Portable Line Spooling Station for use in spooling two new reels. The concept is great but the design is grossly lacking quality and functionality for what is advertised. The spool mounting is just not sturdy enough to provide what is advertised and will not sustain.I suggest that the current design be sent back to production.
2,Could be more sturdy but does the trick,"Having grown tired of hand spooling everything I thought I would give this thing a try. Being a lefty it took a little getting used to, and if you're using fluorocarbon line it tends to pop off of the spool real easy and can quickly get out of control so have some tape handy. Having gone through it a few times now I'm getting the hang of it. Haven't tried the line puller thingy yet, it takes C sized batteries which I haven't gotten around to getting. It looks like more trouble than its worth. If I had it to do over again I probably wouldn't have spent the money. At $20 this would be a reasonable item but at $30 it's just a little over priced."
5,gift,The product was shipped immediately I got in just in time to give as a gift. When it came it was a good condition. My husband hasn't used it yet bc it is not fisihing season here. We are confident there will be no problems even though we haven't opened the pkg yet it looks fine.
1,Fell off the wagon,"After spending about an hour trying to spool mono on my spinning reel, I decided to throw this contraption against the wall. Now I'm out $30 for this POS, another $130 for the reel I fugged up and about $20 for the 1/5th of Night Train I had to drink to get over it."
5,Fishermans Helper,Great little item. It prevents all the juggling and makeshift contraptions that we men can come up with to wind a little line. The spooling station lives up to and surpasses my expectations.
5,spooling and stripping made easy,"I used to spool the line with help of screwdriver, so I bought this product and it made spooling and stripping very easy."
3,This one a little better,than the other one I returned. The splicer that came together with this spooler broke within a minute.This is very light made of plastic. You have to hold and press with one hand while turning the reel with the other hand.It is very hard to keep tension. I need to spool the spectra line very tight. And it is hard to do with this tool
3,"Easy to assemble, shipment was quick, small tear in pad","I purchased the ""Fitness Plus Hyperextension Bench For Back"" primarily so I could do glute-ham raises.On the up-side, the bench shipped quickly, was relatively easy to assemble and thus far supports my weight just fine (I'm right about 210 Lbs).On the downside, the core support arched pad already has a small tear near it's base where it looks to be pulling away from the wood foundation (some duct tape might be in order shortly).For the price, a decent product.- Savage"
5,Sturdy and Purdy,"I got these for a gift. They don't look cheap or poorly made. The holder is a cheapy plastic but nice and the coasters are pretty, full of promise. I am very pleased."
1,Gross Packaging,I purchased this item as a gift for my grandmother. I was really disappointed in the package in came in. The box was dinged and soiled with oil spots. I was grossed out when I pulled it from the mailing box. I had no time to find another so I wrapped it in another box. No way would I have given this gift in the box in came in. This is the risk you take when ordering from a non-Amazon seller.
2,"Product nice, seller not so much.","This product was great, but the person selling it sent a box with a discount store pricetag on it showing it to be much cheaper than the price listed and sold to me for."
5,presenting.. NOW... Bridget Jones,"I loved this album!First of all because it includes incredible songs such as: Someone like You by Van Morrison, Say what you want from Texas, and Waterfalls from TLC.Second, because some of the songs reminded me of some of the best scenes in the movie!I think this second album is better than the first, simply because the songs are better, the artists are stronger, and the compilation just makes for an excellent romantic, highly audible CD.I bought it 6 days ago, and as of today, it is still playing non stop... on my pc, my car, my bedroom..."
1,How many fools are there,The price for the CD is ridiculous. I just watched Briget Jones 2 and was thinking about buying the CD. But both amazon and the merchants must think that the buying public is nuts if they think we would pay such an exorbitant price. It is not like buying a recording of Streisand or Elvis; it is just a soundtrack from a movie.
3,Mouthful of Dust Only,Unfortunately my selection was out of stock. I reordered direct from Amazon and am still waiting.
2,not what I expected,The combo deal is great. but I was used to the movie version so putting in deleted versions kinda ruined it for me.
1,Unknown Commodity,"Unlike most other books on Amazon, there is no information about this book in the editor's comments. Does it cover capital punishment, non-violence, care for teenage pregnancy, adoption reform, as well as prohibition against abortion? Does the Cardinal take a position on all options available to poor unwed mothers, including birth control?"
2,Caveat emptor,"Caveat emptor! Yes, that is right. Before you purchase this title, enlarge the cover graphic and find it contains the two already published books ""L.A. Dead"" and ""Cold Paradise."" If you do not already own those titles-swell- buy this one! If you do, save your money."
1,Pre Pub - Buyer Beware,"I ordered ""Dead Paradise"" in December when there was little information concerning the content of the book in the listing. I've been reading Woods since Chiefs and while Stone Barrington is not my favorite lead character, I trusted the author to provide another good read in a new book.When I received the book two and a half months later, I have to admit Woods had provided a good read but years before with the publication of ""L.A. Dead"" and ""Cold Paradise"". I don't know if the idea to market the books in this manner was the publishers or the authors but those of us who are Woods fans and bought ""Dead Paradise"", will not be caught unaware again.I will not be automatically pre-ordering selections without full information in the listing. In fact, I'm reviewing my pre-orders as soon as I complete this review."
1,DEAD REREAD PARADISE,"I'm appalled at this marketing. I've read every book Mr. Woods has written and have enjoyed them all. This type of marketing should not be allowed. It would have been simple to make the Cover obvious as to contents. For those who have not read the novels it's a good deal, otherwise very disappointing advertising."
1,Almost Duped,"I was just before ordering as I had not read this one, only to find out that it was two old novels in same cover. It pays to check Amazon reviews. I would have been miffed if I had bought it. I usually read them just as soon as they are published.Beware of strange marketing practices."
1,Another Deceived Woods Fan!,I too was duped into believing I was buying a new Stone Barrington novel only to find that it was 2 old novels that I have already read. Lesson learned...always read the Amazon customer reviews first!
1,Deceptive marketing,I feel I have been ripped off. I thought I was getting a new Stuart Woods book and come to find out Dead Paradise is two of Woods' existing books combined in one-both of which I already own. Now I have to pay the shipping to return a book I obviously don't wnat or need.
3,Feel Cheated,"I felt cheated when I received the book Dead Paradise, because it's two books in one, and I'D READ BOTH, LA Dead and Cold Paradise! I re-read Cold Paradise because I didn't want to go to the trouble of sending it back.I'm love Stuart Woods, but I'm going to be more careful choosing his books in the future."
1,Disgraceful marketing practice!,"As a huge fan of Stuart Woods' novels, I jumped when I saw a ""new"" book. Thank goodness I happened to read the reviews and wasn't lured into the purchase of two books I've already read! I agree with others, that if a person hasn't already read L.A. Dead and Cold Paradise, go for it, otherwise, look out!"
1,Dead Paradise,"Didn't realize that it was a book with a new title combining two previous books I already had. This is not your fault, but of the Author.Believe it was a deliberate misleading practice."
1,Dead Paradise,"I ordered Dead Paradise, when the book arrived, although the title of the book was DEAD PARADISE, the book was a compliation of LA Dead and Cold Paradise. In other words, LA DEAD and Cold PARADISE becam DEAD PARADISE (not what I ordered). Seller has done nothing to remedy the situation."
3,"Great coverage, but written for specialists","This book has something of a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality. A reader who is comfortable reading research literature on insects will find an organized, thoroughly documented and well-balanced summary of current knowledge of insect flight. Unfortunately, Dudley is one of those scholars whose writing is saturated with technical jargon and complex sentences, even when simpler English could make the same point. So while the content is great, reading this work is the mental equivalent of hiking through knee-deep snow. Enthusiastic entomologists will find it worth reading: everyone else will find it hard to follow."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I ordered this brush last week, and what I received instead of the Omega Professional Boar Hair brush that was advertised was an Omega SB-550, a brush of relatively inferior quality that regularly retails on eBay for about $12. Don't get taken by the false advertising. Only deal with reputable shaving supply houses, and make sure you are getting exactly what you order at a fair price. Buyer beware!"
4,Much to like about this less than $20 brush!,"I'm a big fan of this brush. There's a lot to like out the just $13 this thing cost me. I MAY get an upscale Semogue Owner's Club boar brush *some* day if I go gaga over boar bristles, but it won't be for a while, if ever.Pros:+ Affordable+ Colors!+ Price-to-performance ratio makes it a *great value*+ Knot is enormous+ Knot is dense+ Very little shedding+ Very long bristles+ Performs well on hard and soft soaps.Cons:- Does not come de-funked (smells of sanitizing chemicals)- Takes a longer time than normal to de-funk (about 10 lathers)- The handle is huge to the point of fatiguing my hand- The handle is difficult to fit in most stands- It's hard-bristled (but not scratchy, mind you)- Swallows up creams when used in hard waterIn all I'd rate this a buy/recommend it to friends."
5,Best Shave Ever,This brush is the perfect size and really holds the lather. Quality product. No shedding.This ones definitely a keeper.
4,i only see. no use,"buy for gift. come nice package. shiny handle. looks like not cheap product. soon to be brother in law say work good but he no shave with brush. he use gillette. good idea for gift, works good. need to find person that use. maybe grandmama use for mustache."
4,Omega Boar Brush Review,"Appearance:Very nice appearance. Seems to be very solidly put together. It is larger than I expected, though it is not unwieldy; it reaches right down into a shaving mug nicely.Function after a weeks use:Lathers very well with Proraso both in a mug and by just putting a bit on the wetted brush hair. There is no odor from the brush that I was able to detect, all was well from the start.My other brush is a Tweezerman Badger, and this definately is a bit stiffer, but not unpleasantly so. I think I prefer this brush to the Badger Hair at this time.Issues:Only one, the handle is a bit big for my shaving stand, though the brush part slides into the stand just fine."
1,I would give it zero stars if it was possible.,"I have used a few different shave brushes and after hearing good things about the omega brushes I decided to give it a shot. The brush is still and is good for lathering hard soaps.After 5 months of use the handle cracked down the side, I contacted Omega to seek a repair or replacement and never received a reply. I would suggest buying a brush from a company that respects its customers enough to respond to an email.JUST GOOGLE OMEGA BRUSH CRACKED HANDLE"
1,Dead in 6 months,"I bought one of these a year or two ago to replace my original Fuji Finepix 6900Z battery which was no longer holding a charge for very long. I used it for a graduation, and occasionally thereafter for a couple of months. Appeared to work fine. The camera was not used for a month, so when I was going to use it again and turned the camera on I was not too surprised that it did not come on. I plugged the charger cord into the camera to charge it, but the charging light did not even flicker. Thinking maybe the charger had died, I took the battery out of the camera and put it in the wall charger for it. The charge light did not even flicker on it either. I had kept the old original battery, which was many years old, and stuck it in the charger, and the light came on immediately. I tried the new battery in the charger again, still with no charge light coming on. I was never able to get it to charge at all. Dead, dead, dead..."
5,Batteries fro Fuji Camera,"I have been looking for these particular batteries for many months. They evidently are discontinued for general use. No camera shop carries the batteries.You provided new batteries at a good price AND quick delivery.Thanks Amazon.com !!!!Norman Smith, Muscatine, Iowa USA"
2,Not what the picture shows!,"I wanted to get a costume from 300, so I got this shield. The actual item is a dark-colored, thin, easily breakable piece of plastic, with a faint gold spray-paint effect. The handle broke constantly, and the picture shown is not what you receive!"
2,"cheap, flimsy, and overpriced.","I bought this as a costume prop and when I received it was rather disappointed. Though it served its purpose, had I known of its bad quality I would have not paid as much as I did for it. It looks like something from the 99 cent store. I did not get bang for my buck."
5,Great!,"Does anyone know the name of the song that plays in the scene when Jessica comes back from the mall and is walking into her house, but stops to play basketball for a sec? Its kinda tecno and I really like it! Whats the name of it?"
3,Song!?,"In some three scenes, when Jessica switches body with the guy in his apartment, they play a funky tune which is not on the soundtrack. Does anyone know what it's called?? It sounds like something from the 70's.????"
2,Response to you,"Hey, I know this isn't a discussion board, but I would have to say that ""take tomorrow"" by butch walker isn't bad. This is coming from a big marvelous 3/butch walker fan. Really, ""take tomorrow"" isn't butch's style usually, but it's a cool song. Most of the rest of the stuff that played during the movie, I could take or leave, but jimmy eat world and marvelous 3/butch walker all put out great stuff."
3,Soundtrack Question,"WHAT is that song when Jessica gets pulls up to her house in her VW and shoots the basketball? It's something like ""In the summer.......i've been locked in a room for much too long, to tell you the truth i dont really wanna sing this song"" Help would be appreciated. thanks"
4,Good CD,Good CD! Even better movie! What song is playing when Rob is dancing with Bianca!??! Anyone know?
3,NEED TO FIND A SONG???,"Hey guys...anytime you need to find a song or any information at all about a movie all you need to do is this.. go tohttp://www.imdb.com (internet movie data base)...it has everything you need to know about any movie or tv series..ie: what its about, when it was made, who is in it..or you can type an actor's name in it and it will show you everything they have ever done..right down to guest appearences on TV. Check it out it is quite handy for all your movie needs!"
4,question about a song in movie,who sings the song that was played during the dance club scene right before B'anca startes dancing?
3,An OK movie,"The soundtrack was ok. Nothing special. The name of that song that you wanted to know is ""Feva For the Flava"" by Hot Action Cop."
4,Soundtrack,The song when Spence and April walk into the prom is Hot Action Cop - Fever for the flava.
2,what is that song?,"im looking for that song that rob dances to in the club by himself ... the one at the club right after he dances with that girl and tears her shirt. he is trying to be sexy and shakes his bootie. after that the girl says, ""you are a good dancer."" and he says, "" you're just now figuring that out?"" can anyone please help me?! what is that song???"
2,Soundtracks in general,"In general, movie soundtracks suck, and this is no exception. They never put in the good songs. I am disappointed each time. I think ""soundtrack"" should mean that each song in a movie that is heard is included...no more of this selective baloney that leaves half the songs out."
3,InCoMpLeTe!!,"ok, when i saw this cd i fell in love with the songs that were on it!! especially the ones where jess and billy are kissing...its like one day at a time or something...well thats not on the cd! i also like when spence or ""taquito"" is gardening and he looks up and sees her brother dancing in a dress and makeup in her room. i duno if thats on the cd?? and i also like the song at the prom that people have been asking about and also the summer song or something...THIS CD NEEDS THESE SONGS! otherwise i'm not buying it."
3,in appreciation to all,oh man...i've been trying to find out what that song was called...my ma is so crazy bout that song..she's been bugging me bout it..thankees fer the revelation y'know the a.m. to p.m. song..oh how bout the one when he was dancing solo?that song is so funny...lemme know yah...
1,i'd like to know what's the song name whe the movie ends,"I HAVE BEEN TRY TO FIND OUT THE SONG WHEN THE MOVIE ENDS, SO I COULDN`'T AND I WOULD LIKE THAT SOMEONE CAN TELL ME, I LIKE IT THE TITTLE AND WHO DOES SING IT. ALSO IN THE CLUB THE FIRST ONE WHEN JESSICA WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS, I GUESS IT`S ROCK LIKE THIS AND THE SHAKE YA AS, WHOM DO SING THIS SONGS:PLEASE LET ME KNOW IN MY EMAIL"
5,The HOt Chick,"Yes, this is a review in addition the the people who didn't know what the song was at the prom when Spence and April walked in. The song is called Fever for the Flava by Hot Action Cop, I hope this is useful to you.Whitni"
4,Review/Question,"The music was really awesome, good songs for a good movie. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for random comedy (adam sandler anyone? =) and the soundtrack to anyone who wants to listen to good music.Questions:Why is the Jimmy Eat World song that they played in the middle of the movie not on the soundtrack?Which song is the one that they play at the end of the movie/beginning of the credits?Please write another review with the answers..."
5,what's that song?,"I was wondering which that is played when the character of Rob Schneider and Anna Faris is walking out of the prom, the scene where they are talking together, before they kiss to make that Jake character jealous"
3,Hmm Bizarre,"Why wasnt the white stripes song thats in the film on this cd??Its called ""you're pretty good looking"" and is on the De stijl album but maybe they didnt autorise it to go on the CD?"
1,Missing Songs,"I saw the movie yesterday and I recognized two good songs in it, ""The Authority Song"" by Jimmy Eat World and ""You're Pretty Good Looking"" by the White Stripes. So I came to amazon to see if there were any other good songs that I missed. And then I saw that the ONLY two good songs in the movie weren't in the soundtrack. Just to let everyone know that they're missing out."
1,Dont waste your money,1. These are made of cardboard about the thickness of a cereal box and do not appear very durable.2. They do not sound like drums. They dont sound like much at all and are less entertaining than tupperware and a wooden spoon.3. There are no drumsticks in my package but I didn't expect any as they are bongos. You can get somewhat of a drum sound using something harder than your hand. I might make some mini sticks and see if my son likes these any better.4. The box states 3 and over and the item description states 1 and older.All in all I think these were a waste of money and would send them back but dont want to waste the gas. They were already shipped all the way from Israel. Surely we can make as bad a product here at home.I recommend buying something else or have fun making your own as they would be at least as good.
2,Poor quality - my son tore them the first day,"I was shocked to find that the body of the drums are made of cardboard that is formed into a circle and loosely secured with tabs that fit into slots. My nearly two-year-old was able to tear them and pull the cardboard out of the tabs within minutes of opening them. I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. I should have gotten the wooden ones, which were about the same price."
5,Excellent !!!,Excellent battery. Surprisingly it was fully charged and works like a charm when connected to the phone. Thanks.
5,It's like a cooler version of Jesus is watching me.,"E.A. Poe was a gift from my girlfriend. Sadly, a day after I got him, he was perched on my Completed Works of Poe, situated on my desk, when he fell a few feet, the raven breaking from his shoulder. With a little super glue he was right as rain. I wouldn't play with him roughly, but he's fine if you want to have a tea party with Faulkner and Hemmingway. Seriously, how can you deny the sheer awesome that is this action figure?"
4,How Cool is This!,"An Edgar Allan Poe ACTION FIGURE! This is ultra cool. Listed on the back is ""Weapon of Choice: Morbid Rumination"", along with interesting facts about Poe. That fact someone made this is interesting; my 23-year-old son bought it for me as a Father's Day gift. Unlike Clint The Cool Guy (who actually sounds quite cool) I haven't taken mine out of the package yet. Cool to have, cool to display, cool to play with, and apparently goes well with GI Joes."
5,Escape to Twill,"This is one of those books I first discovered in 5th grade, and still pick up when I find myself with nothing to read. It is a timeless fantasy set in a unique kingdom by the sea. The people of Twill are seafarers, and many of them know where their fates lie - in the perilous waters just off the coast. They get everything from the sea, and its most prized treasure is the mysterious lampfish. Eric is a young boy who lives in Twill and is, like many there, an orphan. With his pet seagull, he embarks on an adventure deeper into the secrets of Twill's waters than any before him. The book is wonderfully rich, and full of unique illustrations. I always pictured this story making a beautiful animated film. It's just so artistic... I don't know how to describe it! Every child should read it, because it will stay with them."
4,You have to read this book...,"Billy Graham said, ""There are 3 secrets for a revival -- PRAYER, PRAYER, and PRAYER!"" PRAYING IN THE HARVEST is a must-be-read book for every christian."
2,Outdated,I was expected a bit more here. It is something of a stale presentation. And it's outdated by at least two years. The technology of imaging has moved on. Who does film photography and scanning anymore? Photoshop 7 is also at least 2-3 years behind. CS2 in now the standard.May be worh $26 but I'm not so sure. Why hasn't the author updated this?
2,Photoshop for Astrophotography,"Photoshop for AstrophotographersThis is NOT a book, it is a CD ROM . It is poorly put together, and most of the material is not directed at Astrophotography. We don't need another Photoshop CD! These is some material on correcting images on a Astrophotograph, very little on how to merge multiple images."
2,not compact enough,"I went for this cheap version (which usually suits me well like Dover's or Schirmer's ones). However, I cannot play with this one as it is really not compact and makes reading and page turning quite tedious. Indeed, it takes twice or even three times the number of pages than other versions I used previously."
2,Huh?,"Grey takes a European vacation with his girlfriend and others but on Elba has his first (?) sexual experience with another man. This apparently converts him and he returns to New York to take up with Scott, a whining, unappealing stereotype of the nelly queen. Grey also has a brief, undeveloped fling with his boss, Bob, and then is driven back to Elba where for half of the book nothing happens between him and Paolo. There is much potential here but it is not delivered. The dialogue is also stretched, with Italians inexplicably saying ""ya"" with the same frequency as the Tennesseans in the story. On top of all of this, the book is frequently just weird. Chapter 25 is totally unexplainable. Some, but not all, chapters begin with cartoonish sketches of floorplans or maps. Drew Banks, the author, may want to say Able Was I but this effort doesn't support it."
5,An Extraordinary Find!,"This is a wonderful novel. Original in voice and style. Beautifully written.Grey Tigrett's engaging journey grabbed a hold of me. Grey and the characters in Grey's life were colorful, yet very real. Their reality drew me in. Their reality repeatedly shattered ideals - and replaced them with something far more interesting.I did not want this book end. This is a MUST read for anyone that has ever felt the hollowness of attaining dreamy goals - and has wondered about the richness of enjoying less idealistic passions."
3,Go to your local visitor's center,"If you live in Colorado, I would NOT buy this book. It has no unusual or unrecognized destinations. Any of the information in this book can be obtained at your local visitor's center. If you live out of Colorado, or if you just prefer to spend the money on a bound copy of visitor info, this book is fine. Be aware that the educational content is geared to older (pre-teen) levels. Also, this book covers all of Colorado, so these are not daytrip destinations. The authors have the right idea, but I would like to see them issue some regional guides, e.g. Denver/Boulder area, Western Slope, Southwest Colorado, Colorado Springs area, and include some out of the way and more intriguing trips."
3,Colorado Places for kids,"I guess the book is okay. I was disappointed that it had a page missing in the middle. If I had known that, I probably would not have purchased it."
5,Great Belt,I purchased this belt for my Avalanche pickup. I have had a problem with belts squeeling and had tried 3 factory OEM belts which all squeeled after 1 or 2 weeks. This belt has been on my truck for over 2 months now and has never produced any noise. I highly recommend this product.
1,No figures included-text only document,"Buyer beware: this document is all text. While figures are refenced in the text body, no figures are provided in this download. In other words this document is text only."
5,"Hey, Publishers Weekly, get over yourself","Wow, apparently, according to the Publishers Weekly editorial review above, this book isn't exactly ""War and Peace"". Go figure.What it is is an amusing, basic sci-fi tale for a new reader. The hero is fine, the alien is funny, the plot is simple, and the ending is clear. The book has a great deal of appeal and charm, and avoids the farts and boogers that keep cropping up in other early reader books.I could see a brand new reader feeling a certain amount of satisfaction at having finished this ""real book"", and it certainly has a place on a well-stocked, enticing shelf."
5,Sirius' best receiver!! Great Sound and features a winner!!,I have both XM and Sirius and in my opinion Sirius is the hands down winner. Anybody that has both should tell you the same. I have several Sirius receivers and this is the best receiver that Sirius offers. It has fantastic sound quality that far exceeds plug and play satellite radio receivers. Optical output is great for precision sound quality. A must have for a satellite radio subscriber!
1,Software bug consistently crashes unit,"Scrolling past channel 100 locks up the unit; this is a known bug according to Kenwood level 2 tech support. Must send unit to Kenwood for repair, then wait 14 days to have it fixed. I'm on my second receiver with the same bug."
4,Sirius Tuner,"I like the display and it is very light. The only problem is that is runs very hot and if installed in a cabinet, can be an issue. Otherwise, I am very happy with it's performance."
2,KENWOOD FIRST ENTRY RECIEVER,"I HAD THIS UNIT FOR 2 DAYS, IT BROKE, THEN I RETURNED IT AND 2 OTHER UNITS THAT I RECIEVED WOULD NOT SEE THE ANTENNA OR JUST QUIT, I WOULD WAIT UNTILL KENWOOD COMES OUT WITH A NEW AND IMPROVED MODEL, THEY ARE AWARE THAT THIS UNIT HAS PROBLEMS..............."
4,Great plates,"These plates are very nice, but I was a little disappointed in the quality of the print - it's a little fuzzy. From far away, they're really beautiful, but if you look closely, the pictures are fuzzy and seem like an out-of-focus picture. Overall, we're very happy with them."
3,This Old Harley,"There are a lot of the ""Harley Davidson experience"" books out there, this one isn't bad, but I was expecting more. Get it from your local library if you can."
4,Take care if the size is important for you,"I am not adding anything to the great reviews of this product. I like all its features. However, the amazon review is incorrect describing the size of this puppy. The h340 is bigger than the h320, but the amazon description is the same! The h340 is like 0.2 inches thicker than the h320. No it's not a great difference, but somewhat makes the h340 bulkier than the h320. I own the h320 and I got the h340 from amazon, expecting a similar size and found the increased size a bit dissapointing. Anyway, a great product."
3,RIP 340. It was a great year!,"I bought my 340 roughly one year ago. I set that baby up with Rockbox and I was in heaven! I raved to everyone I could about how great it was: great sound, fm transmitter, playlists on the fly, games, creating/recording my own mp3s, 40GB for a decent price. Sadly, my 340 died a couple of weeks ago. Yes, after just 1 year. Unfortunately, I had to sell its remains in order to finance a replacement. I loved this mp3 player so much I'm actually considering buying another one rather than joining the evil iPod empire. So, I give the 340 3 stars because it's great while it lasts but it doesn't last very long. Just to drive the point home, I also had an h140 that died after roughly 2 years of ownership."
4,pc is to mac as iRiver is to iPod,Bottom line is- if anyone is whining about the usability of this product- they are simply lazy or inept. I have had to have my iPod replaced three times under warranty before finally demanding my money back. On top of that the iPod would freeze my system even the entire OS!.I have had this thing for a day and the difference is clear. If you are in the least bit technically savvy you will love this product.I've finally found what I'm looking for!-Nick<edit> it has been years now- this thing still works... good stuff.
1,what happened to my Iriver?!,"After having my original Iriver stolen, I decided to upgrade to the H340. I got the new one in March, and recently it has completely stopped holding a charge for more than an hour and a half. I am completely bummed out about this- don't want to have to deal with all the limited warranty stuff, but I have no choice. I would advise anyone considering this model to wait until Iriver works out the battery issues."
5,The best one can get!!!!,"The good things you've been reading are all very true. I love this baby! This thing is worth every penny. Try the 1.27 Korean firmware and I have been watching all my movies on this H340. No crushes, no problems, no bugs--the bad things, if any that you have read about it must be paid to be posted here by iPod manufacturers."
3,Great player accept for the manual and customer support,Sounds great! Easy to navigate! The unit does not correct to PCeasily in order to transfer data if you follow the manual's directions. You have to play with different configurations plugging inot the PC concerning the USB2 connection and the power adapter. Customer Service is terrible. I tried to call and e-mail Customer Service but to no avail. Left messages but they never e-mailed me back concerning the problems I was having.
3,suddenly stop working,"I bought my Iriver 4 months ago . I was quite satisfied with quality . Suddenly it stop working yesterday . Its not coming up , its not showing lcd light. I tried to contact customer service but phone is alwasy busy. I wrote them email also but no reply.If i didn;t get the response then i am just gonna loode $400 with all my 14gb songs collection . :-))))))i don;t know what to do."
3,Pushing the 'novelty' factor a little too far in my opinion.,"Not many people seem to like the Hermes House Band version of the old John Denver classic, ""Country Roads"", but I think it's a great party track. This version of the CD single, however, sees the 'Band' pushing the novelty factor just a little too far in my opinion. Incredibly, there's SEVEN different remixes to be found on this CD single (it's my belief, however, that at least FIVE of them sound exactly the same!). If you've already bought the original Hermes House Band CD single for this song AND you buy this one too, you'll own TEN different version altogether PLUS the CD-ROM video too! Seems a bit much for a song that wasn't exactly a best seller in the US/UK.Jon."
5,A-dorable.,"I am in love with yoga and find this book so sweet and charming -- and funny too. I don't even have any kids yet, but I find all the photos so amazing because I have seen babies and little kids do so many of these poses without even trying. Guess that's the point right? They're just 'Born Yogis' ..."
3,Grows on you pretty quickly!,"Upon first listen to Knight's new CD, none of the tracks really seemed to stand out as heavy hitters like some of the melodic NKOTB tunes. And although most of the tracks seem to be lacking some of the melodic magic of previous Knight crooned tunes, upon repeated listens, these new grooves find a pleasant memorable place in your head. The catchy dance groove ""Don't Cry"" proves that Knight still has ""The Right Stuff"" to stay on the pop charts and the edgy ballad ""Have You"" proves that Knight can still sing a great slow/mid tempo jam. I've long praised the vocal abilites of Jordan Knight, and again, he has not let me down. Now get on your remake of ""If You Go Away"" and blow the world away- You can do it man!"
5,Great Album,This is a great album. Jordan sings the heck out of the ballads. And you can never get enough of his dance tunes. I only wish there were more songs on the album. Don't make us wait another 6 years for the next one.
5,jordan knight is back,Jordan's cd is great a little new and a little old sound .He is sounding better than ever.HOT CD for a HOT MAN.get it you wont regret it.
5,Get your fix!!,"WARNING: The Fix contains addictive ingredients!! Side effects include hot flashes, racing pulse, increased energy and bouts of undressing have been noted in frequent users. The Fix should only be taken in the presence of a good man. Songs contained in this ep are erotic and inticing. (My husband and I enjoy this CD frequently.) Buy the CD, you will not be disappointed."
3,I Needed a Fix,"This album is romantic, has some good dance tracks and is anchored by the hilarious and sexy title track. If you love Jordan Knight you should check this one out."
4,Elvin's Unique(and superb) But Forgotten Album,"Stephen Arnade Palm Bay,FL This is absolutely a Superb Album From The 1970's. The album ROCK MY SOUL is one those gems of music that never received the recognition when initially released. This is not your typical Elvin Bishop album, with focus on great rock-and-roll with a R&B influence. Released in 1972, this album seemed to have Elvin working well with Jo Baker. They just sparked each other. Jo Baker great singing talent comes across on the song ""Rock Bottom"", where she sings lead. The song ""Stomp"" shows the great guitar playing talent of Elvin Bishop. The song ""Don't Mind If I Do"" showcases the song writing talent of Elvin."
5,Instant Classic!,"This is an instant classic. Almost every single track is incredible. Ghost is not only keeping Wu Tang afloat, he's holding up the whole East Coast, too. The combination of Ghost over Doom's beats is unbelievable! If you consider yourself a fan of grimy New York hip hop go get this immediately!"
4,asdf,"i have NOTHING to add to this cd ontop of the already awesome featured reviews, but to add my stars... this is BLOODY great, 9/10ths as good as more fish... (i'm sorry, but I like more fish more)...it's a bloody classic that everyone should have, who like the underground, wu-tang, or your trying to become more educated in the more-excellent rap...bloody great...!"
4,On a scale of... 4.5 stars,"Fishscale was the second best rap record released in 2006 (see Clipse ""Hell Hath No Fury""). Considering how prolific Tony Starks has been over the past decade it's a miracle he is not putting out watered down radio jams like some other notable east coast emcees. And for anyone out there disputing who is the rightful heir to the thrown of ""King of New York"" or even ""Best Rapper Alive"", look no further. Ghostface Killah #1 with a bullet."
3,It's ok....but not great,This was a good release by ghostface. But to me it's not as good as i thought it would be. Its got some good songs....but theres too many skits in the beginning of the cd. I like more music in cds...i hate when they do all those skits. The thing that makes this an ok cd is the rhymes. But the beats don't really flow with the rhymes. It doesn't really catch your attention or make you bounce your head.Gamer101's Top 5 Fav. Songs1.Three Bricks feat. Notorious B.I.G & Reakwon (bonus Track)2.Back Like That feat Ne-yo3.9 Milli Bros feat Wu Tang Clan4.Kilo feat. Reakwon5.Shakey Dog
3,A Bit Overrated,"This album aint as good as most people say it isthe beats are nice but gets annoying after about 9 songshalf of the album is descent the other half kinda... hh..i dont know...a bit boring.im not a big wu tang fan.but i like ""36 chemebers"" betterthen this one."
3,"Liked the first half, didnt like the second","Still the best hip-hop album of 2006 so far, but I thought the first half of the album had the best tracks, didn't care so much for the second half besides Dogs of War. The track Three Bricks with Biggie is weak, doesnt fit with the rest of the songs. I think the Wu is gonna make a come back tho this year, with this and Raekwon's Only built for cuban linx 2... cant wait!Favorite Songs-Shakey DogThe Champ9 mili bros (second fav)R.A.G.U. (favorite)Be EasyKiloDogs of War"
2,2 1/2 stars very mediocre ! ! !,"this cd is just too simply overated there are too many skits and the beats arent that great there are only seven good tracks the rest are garbage.dont cop this cd. if you want to hear some real ghost face pick up supreme clientele, iron man, or more fish !!!!"
2,it's alright,"I like Ghostface's flow&always felt the cat brought it,but there is no way that he is anywhere near to where he was a decade ago as a Artist&this disc shows that.lyrical content is cool,but the Production is hit&miss. i wasn't feeling this album quite like that,but it ain't has some moments.a bit long in the musical tooth&I've heard better from Ghostface before&nothing here is touching Ghost in his prime,but he is probably the only cat from Wu that I would even drop cash on to buying."
3,Not Ghostface killa in top form,"I find it hard to comprehend how some reviewers would even consider comparing this album to the classic Supreme Clientelle. On this album Ghostface is clearly not at his peak although on songs such as R.A.G.U,Shakey dog,barbeshop and underwater we get to see a hint of what most have come to expect from Ghost,unique and entertaining lyrics delivered as only he can. Unfortunately this does not carry through for the whole album and furthermore the beats are nothing to shout about. Therefore in my opinion this album only deserves 3 stars as there is nothing ground breaking here and it is just basically an average album. It would be good to see Ghost hook up with RZA for an album. I think something really groundbreaking would come out of that because I think Ghost still has the potential in him to do something big once again and RZA is a production ""Abbot"" so a combination like that is bound to explode."
5,"Not Only the WU, but he also saved HIPHOP as well.","INSTANT CLASSIC!They say you should wait 'til at least 10 years to consider an album of this magnitude a classic....!&@# DAT!CLASSIC material,deal with it."
5,Another Wu Classic that needs to be bought,"Ghostface killah is a rap machine, he seems to never stop, he reminds me of both Kool G Rap and MF Doom if they were mixed into one. He hops around with his rhymes and bounces from subject to subject to give you the full picture, while telling tales of the street hustle. Also he picks the perfect production, for his album, he is in a ball park of his own. While every other fake blown up rapper is doing some lil john beats, Ghost stays with the soul full pete rock, and Jay Dilla beats, that a true hip hop head can feel. I know it is wrong to compare Supreme Clientele to Fishscale, but to tell you the truth they are both the same, in terms of quality, he hasnt fell off one little bit. Not a track should be or will be skipped."
2,What happened to Ironman?,"Granted, its a good album and when I first put on Shakey Dog I was expecting so much more. The first four tracks are outstanding, but ""kilo"" gets a bit tired after a while. Shakey Dog is clearly the best song on the album, and one could say it goes downhill from there. The stream of consciousness that made Toney is just not there. Lets face it, he is THE reason Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is what it is, and no one in Wu comes close to displaying his raw emotion. Some of the emotion is there, but there are just too many hooks, no flow, just catchy hooks. Boring, if I want hooks, Ive got everyone else. Where is Ironman"
5,Raw Hip Hop!,"Fishscale is raw,entertaining,and cinematic hip-hop at its finest!Ghost touches all bases as far as hip-hop,commercial,and the ALL important Wu-Tang fan base.Fishscale is a classic/high quality disc(minus the Biggie Bonus Track).If you like good music and you are not confined to a ""box"",buy this album twice!Fishscale seems destined to be the best rap album/LP of 2006.Ghost murders...1).Shakey Dog 2).The Champ 3).Columbus Exchange/Crack Spot 4).R.A.G.U. 5).Underwater just to name a handful.GHOSTFACE KILLAH is simply the BEST right now!(P.S.-Im from the South..F*ck that Laffy Taffy bullsh*t type rap!)"
4,Solid Rap,"Solid performance by Ghostface and Wu-Tang co, along with good production and a great price make this an excellent cd. Of note: CD produced by Mario Caruso who worked with the Beastie Boys on ""ill communication"" and ""check your head."""
4,about time,"If you were disapointed with the pretty tony album and were not optimistic about Fishscale your in for a big surprise. Ghost redeemed himself dropin some original wu gangster **** and not that disco crap. whole wu practicly shine on track6 with real wu tang style and lyrical flow. Fishscale worth picking up, wu fans cant deny this album."
4,Toney Montana!!!,"Yea the album ""Fishscale"" is a pretty good album... R.I.P. Jay dilla(One of my favorite producers), he produced ""Beauty Jackson"" on the LP. Songs like ""Dogs of War"", ""9 Mili"", ""Jellyfish"" are some bangers on the album... Ghostface is a very very important member for the Wu-tang Clan he keeps the the organization going and I love him for that... NOW I AM WAITIING FOR THE CUBAN LINX 2 BY RAEKWON... IT SHOULD BE A BANGER......"
5,Best since Supreme,"It's been a long time since I have so thoroughly enjoyed an album from one of the Shaolin collective. If anyone needs any indication of the ongoing Wu-Renaissance pick up Fishscale.From the frantic wordplay and storytelling of ""Shakey Dog"" where Ghost is talking about everything from the uncomfortable taxi seats to how much ketchup is on the food to the track ""KILO"" witch is the coke anthem to end all coke anthems Fish delivers that high class blow. Rae comes back on a few tracks and forms a dynamic with Ghost that hasn't been heard since those Cuban Linx days. This is Ghost's soulful guilty coke dealing childhood reminiscing frantic i have something to prove self. If this is any indication of how 8 Diagrams is going to be, then I suggest all those dip sets and G-units better start worrying because the Clan is looking more and more relevant every day and it looks like they're bringing that heat"
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this book based on reviews, and the promise of an unusual premise. Many first novels are wonderful, but this is not one of them. The characters seem one-note personalities, without development (unless you count rot as movement), and thus hard to care about. While the idea of the story is compelling, the plot is manipulated to the point that I stopped looking for logic, reason, or even the power to suspend disbelief. The book is horror-fantasy, to be sure, but if I can't believe a word of it, then it doesn't work for me. The prose seems wooden, and I was finally so frustrated with it that I threw it on the floor. I don't often have a book tantrum, but unfortunately, this novel brought one on. I hate to discourage first time writers, but I hope Ms. Mitchell gets better editing on her next effort, because her work this time out really doesn't seem ready to be presented as a finished, polished book."
2,Not worth your time!!!,"The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is because the idea is original, other thatn that I have nothing nice to say about it. The blurb on the front says this arthor is one to watch. NOT unless she can keep a story coherent and flesh out hte characters some more. Don't waste your money, there are so many other good books out there. Try A Dry Spell or Bastion Falls by Susie Maloney or anything by Koontz or King!!"
4,Very Nice,"This tiny little book is chocked full of different spark ideas. And not just for those looking for inspiration on their next big novel. I actually bought it so that I could get some fresh ideas for blog writing. Since then I've been able to pull out several different ideas that I otherwise wouldn't have been inspired to write about. Plus, it looks kinda nice just sitting on the desk :-)"
2,Waste!,"A waste of my money, I bought two blocks. They are adornments/decoration for my desk. Have not used one time for intended purpose."
1,Not Very Reliable,"Like most of the others reviewing this unit, my HDRW720 is also just resetting at random times. I was actually at home reading the paper when it happened once. The unit just turns on randomly, all of the lights come on, it resets and then poof, all of your timers and preferences are gone. I have called Philips support to ask about it and while they are helpful, they say that nobody else has reported this and it's probably specific to memory in the unit. It happens at least once every 30 days and you end up starting from scratch each time. Coming home to find the unit back at factory defaults and all of your timers gone makes this unit pretty useless. I have upgraded to the latest firmware (3.2) but the problems continue. Philips wants $173 + tax + shipping for out of warranty service to try and fix this. I would avoid this unit and look at something else."
1,Obviously an awful excuse for a product,"I read dozens of these reviews before buying Pioneer DVR-640H. The fact that only refurbished HDRW720 units are available should give you a clue to their reliability or ergonomics problems. My Pioneer has been awesome for 6 months now, no complaints, and it records to DVD +/- R/RW DL (Dual Layer)! But, unfortunately for you it appears Amazon doesn't sell it anymore, try elsewhere because it is highly recommended!"
1,Poor quality,The drawrer that loads the dvd broke. Now it tries to load a dvd when none is in. It grinds and moans.
2,nice features but ultimately unreliable,"When it works, it's great, but operation (esp. with TV Guide feed) is extremely unstable. Will tend to reset, hang, lose TV Guide channel/program information, ""forget"" to record programmed shows, forget to stop at the end of a recorded program, and probably a few other things that I forget because they didn't quite happen frequently enough.This is clearly a prematurely released product. If had a dollar for every time this box crashed, it would have earned its purchase price back long ago."
3,Can you record from Cable?,"I purchased this DVR for a Christmas present and would have to agree that the remote control and menus lack organization and intuitiveness.I would like to know if anyone can advise me if they have been able to record a ""premium"" channel such as HBO or Showtime, and play it back later from the hard drive or record it to a DVD+R?I do not have any premium channels at this time, but I am concerned that all premium channels will be copyright protected, similar to a commercial DVD. I am not using a cable box, and my cable company is COMCAST."
1,WARNING: Doesn't work with DirectTV or DishNetwork!,"I have been trying to get my HDRW720/17 to download and use DirectTV's programming info (their 'TV Guide') to no avail since Christmas. Finally, today I gave up and called Phillips. A tech rep finally told me that the unit is not compatible with any Hughes Satellite service (such as DirectTV, Dish Network, etc). He explained that it was optimized for Comcast Cable, so unless you have Comcast or a compatible cable service you are likely to have problems with it. I guess I'll list it on eBay and buy the Tivo/DVD marketed by DirectTV."
3,Not the greatest,"I bought this for only $199 at costco and it sounded like a great deal. One of the few advantages is the price, you won't find another DVD-R with a Hard Drive for this price. Disadvantages:It does not record High Definition channelsTakes more than a couple of seconds to turn itself onMy unit would shutdown by itself sometimesThe audio had static on some channels (may be it was just my unit)It claims to play all types of DVD-R + and -, but half of all I tried did not playTha manufacturer's website does not offer much useful information besides the owner's manual which already came with the unitI took mine back and got a DVR unit from my cable provider instead which actually records HD channels, the picture is perfect. The downside of this is that I have to pay $10 a month for it but hopefully in a year the price of good quality DVD-R with HD will have come down dramatically.Do not purchase this product if you can afford one of better quality."
1,the worst piece of consumer electronics i've ever owned,"I bought this about a year ago; for a month or two, I was happy with it. It was a perfectly fine DVD player, the DVR functionality worked well. (The DVR functionality wasn't as well done as what I hear from my Tivo-owning friends, but it seemed acceptable.)Then it crashed, and forgot the channel listings it had stored up, and forgot what I'd asked it to record. And it happened again, and again, sometimes throwing other misbehavior into the mix (individual channels dropping out of the programming guide, which admittedly may not be its fault; not stopping a recording when it's supposed to). And it can silently not record programs for a week, if you don't notice that something has gone wrong. It's simply not a reliable way to record a program; it works most of the time, but that's not the standard that I want my equipment to reach.And now it can't read DVD's, either. Really, this thing is just a piece of junk."
2,Philips HDRW,"I'v had this unit for about a year, and have had lots of little problems with it- nothing that required actual repair, but lots of software/functionality bugs. I'm particularly upset that the TV Guide Plus channel that's included is now no longer available on my cable system, so now I have to program everything manually. So instead of a nice browser list of program names, all I get is a list of channel numbers and dates. I have another similar Philips unit that has been even worse. I'd probably never buy another Philips product."
2,"Very so so, unless you want to take chance","I brought this at Costco for $199. So, the price was great. Yes, everything else people said here is true. It is hard to use and unreliable. I am lucky that nothing major has happen but it does occasionally reboot itself for no reason. Yes, it also forgot to record programs sometime. I am an engineer and a gadget freak. I still can't figure it out some time. I still refer to the manual after 6 months.My recommendation: Don't buy at $400. Maybe $200 is OK if you are good with electronic and willing to take the risk. It does work with some pain."
1,Philips HDRW720,"Don't buy this item. I had to return the first one to Philips since it would spontaneously freeze and shut down. I am having the same problem with the replacement. Simple functions such as changing the channel or selecting the guide will cause it to freeze and shut down. Sometimes it just shuts down or reboots spontaneously without ever touching the remote or the unit itself. Features sound great, but very poor operating quality.Update: still having problems with this unit - I am about to smash it with a hammer."
5,"Sleep levels, dreams and biological cloks.","You will not want to stop reading this book. It tells all about the mechanism of sleep, about dreaming and biological clocks. It is easy to read, informative and very interesting. It is very important to read this book to learn about so many myths about sleeping. It will change your life forever! Ron."
4,"George Harrison Writes Intro & Definition of ""GOD""","George Harrison writes a page at the beginning of this text. It may be a bit haunting to read now that Harrison has gone on to greener places, but his words about ""God"" are immortal. It's challenging to accept Harrison's ""Transcendental Consciousness"" perspective perhaps, especially if one is indoctrinated my restrictive dogma. He does, however, create the curiosity, and if one then reads KRSNA, The Supreme Personality of Godhead creative space opens to allow for pondering of greater ideas. [[ASIN:B000KDP7OQKRSNA]]It may be too difficult a concept to grasp, but with an open mind, on the opposite side of the spectrum, it certainly creates a magnificent wonder....What if this little book contains the secrets to the Universe? Are you open to the investigation of all things possible?J. DeelstraAuthor, Blessings In The Mire, A True Story of Miracles & Recollections (Infinity 2007)Blessings in the Mire"
5,"Beautiful illustrations, heartwarming story","This book was one of the few that has kept my preschoolers with special needs focused until the end. They were spellbound by the illustrations and loved the traditional eskimo story. About a month later, one of my little preschoolers found it in the libray and wanted to check it out, remembering the story from class. Well done!!"
4,A little pricey..but solid quality,"I bought one of these for a student of mine who needed (just) a new top. I thought the price was a little high, considering that I could get an entire gi of decent quality...both top and bottom...for just a little bit more from other manufacturers...but I guess the option of packaging and handling a ""split"" set does add to the overall cost. (That's what added so much to the cost...the shipping and handling part.) HOWEVER, I cannot complain about the workmanship and overall quality of the item that I received. It is made of a very rugged material, and is put together very well. It should hold up during many hours of hard training."
1,other than the nozzle hole,"I ordered this product to help stop chiggers.. and followed instructions to spray on clothing especially around cuffs, etc.. the warnings also said to keep off bare skin, eyes, mouth, children etc..The can sprayed out the nozzle but about 1/3 of the liquid somehow puddled in the top of the can when held up right and out right dripped/ran out if held horizontal.... in this malfunction process rinsed whoever was spraying the poison. This spray can had a very cheap nozzle and wasted lots of repellent ( dripping from around the nozzle top)..Very poor quality control @ best..And of course this 9 oz can costing more than $1 per oz would not cover 4 sets of outfits.. barely covered two pants..Totally unacceptable.."
1,product does NOT work,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! (unless you love chigger bites) I would rate it a 0 if I could. I was fooled by the advertising of this product. After carefully applying exactly according to directions, I confidently headed off into the woods to weedeat/clear some local mountainbike trails. I was covered from head to toe...boots, pants tied shut at ankles, long sleeves, gloves. Soaked everything the day before with this product. 2 days later (that's when chigger infestations show themselves) my neck looks like I'm wearing a red turtleneck! It's awful. The chigs crawled up the treated shoes, up the treated pants, up the treated shirt until they found my open neck. Today I'm in so much discomfort I'm just plain mad. I'm going back to the age-old ""sulfer-powder"" dusting that folks have used for years. Of course, that product does not make any money for big corporations, or have any wonderful-sounding marketing hype. (rant over)"
4,Did the trick,"I used this on all my clothes for a trip to Africa, and as far as I know it did the trick. I saw mosquitoes, but never had one on me...so I guess it did the trick."
3,Clothing Insect repellent,"I can't really remember how the product worked. I can say that while I was in Costa Rica, I didn't get any insect bites. I did spray my clothing with this product before the trip."
2,What is the real point of the movie?,"I don't get the real point of the movie. While the movie makes a good point that love is more important than money, the two are not mutually exclusive. When Jack told Kate that he found a job in NYC that pays twice as much as he makes now, Kate didn't want to move from her community in NJ to NYC because money wasn't important to her and their kids like where they are. Well, kids are little and will adjust to whatever environment they're in. If she was uncomfortable about changing communities, NYC has many different communities and she could find the one she'd be comfortable in. They could also visit NJ community often and invite their old friends to visit them. In other words, a solution could be worked out that would meet Jack's and Kate's wishes. So, what's the point? To make losers feel better about where they are?"
5,Great snapshot of Helix in their early years.,"Just a great CD. The sound is fine, not super fantastic but sounds great live.The intro and the between songs raps are excellent as well.Still available for sale at PlanetHelix (way lower price than this woodys_books)."
2,Cheaply made,"One of the toys fell apart after only two weeks. They are poorly made and are shoddily held together with glue. When I opened the package the eye of one of the mice had already fallen off, another one had a big clump of dried glue on the outside, and then after two weeks the green one fell apart spilling out its inside (catnip cardboard stuffing??)."
1,"Beware these are now the 'fur'mice, not 'natural'","I have ordered the natural mice several times. The last order placed recently was switched out for the fur mice. These have carpet like outsides and the tail is of the same material. My cat won't even consider them.When I have tried to choose the 'return' option, I cannot connect no matter what time of day I have tried. After 10 different attempts I give up. I am stuck with 12 mice. It is not just the cost of the item I am out, I am irritated that the product has been changed, but the description of the product has not been updated. What has happened to the ability to return a product that was not ordered?"
1,Not what is expected,"This book is supposedly a ""NEW"" review of the DAT (Dental Admissions Test). The book fails to deliver comprehensive infomation on the DAT. Firstly, the book fails to recognize that that DAT format is now on computer, so the strategies for the pencil and paper test are completely out of date. Secondly, the book is organized in sections (Biology, Gen. Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, etc..) Each section contains multiple groupings of questions. There is no complete test within the book. I would recommend a book that cost less for this format. Another drawback is the typeface of the book. It seems that it was produced on a typewriter and copied at the local copy shop. There are better DAT books out there such as the Betz Guide and the Kaplan. Better yet go get one of the many MCAT books for less money."
2,old style Oi,"really great Oi album out of Holland. Cool lyrics about the usual skinhead themes, this is old style & worth buying."
4,Great stuff!,"Last year my 3yr old and I walked into a shop that was playing this CD. They did not carry it, but I quickly jotted down all the information so we could order it right away because I knew it would be a big hit with my son just like Raffi had been.Purists may not approve, but kids WILL...and lot's of parents will too. I love the real unpolished voices of real kids singing these songs plus some guest appearances from popular singers. With all the annoying music by characters like Barney being served up...this kid's version of well loved Beatles songs is a tasty treat in our house. Buy it!"
5,Beatles CD for Kids,"This is one awesome CD. If you love the Beatles (and even if you don't) you're sure to love this one. My daughter gets surprised when she actually hears the original Beatles music on the radio - because she knows the song from ""her"" CD."
4,Brings Kids and Parents together,"""Beatles Songs for Kids"" is an excellent way to close up the generation gap between parents and their children. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a perfect rating of 5 is the noticable absence of such hits as ""Why Don't We Do it in the Road"", ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"", and ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer""."
2,Poor song selections,"I was more than disappointed in this album. Not only were some of the songs drawn out too long and done in such a dreary style (Dear Prudence and Birthday) that it was too tedious and tiresome to listen to. I was also annoyed and felt it extremely inappropriate to include a song with lyrics which said, ""can I take my friend to bed?"" Really, what were they thinking about."
2,All You Need is Tolerance,"Perhaps if you are used to listening to Barney crooning ""I love you, you love me.."", this might be a welcoming change. Unfortunately, for us, my daughter (she is three) has been a fan of the Broadway Kids for some time now, and she won't listen to the ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE... I have tried to persuade her into listening to it again since the first playing to no avail. Maybe this is a CD that requires a few plays to ""get used to"", however, I'm not sure it's going to happen in this home. Thanks anyway."
1,Disappointed,Buyers beware. This is not the Beatles singing. I didn't do my homework and just assumed that 'Beatles Songs for Kids' would be a selection of Beatles songs appealing to children performed by the Beatles. I'm very disappointed! The songs don't sound nearly as good as the originals.
1,ALL YOU NEED IS.........EARPLUGS!,"I LOVE THE BEATLES....I DISLIKE CHILDREN.....AND I HATE THIS ALBUM. OKAY, MAYBE I'M BEING A LITTLE HARSH....I LOVE THE BEATLES.....I HATE children...and I dislike this album."
1,Really Annoying and Commercial,"I have over a dozen Beatles CD's, and we enjoy their music in our home from time to time. I suggest that if you want to expose your children to the Beatles, then play music actually made by the Beatles.In contrast, this CD is commercial trash. We can't stand it! The version are very lame, and I can't see any benefit to children. It's not children's music. It's an opportunity to cash in on the Beatles.Get something by Raffi if you are looking for really fun, beneficial children's music. And expose your children to the real Beatles when they get a little older."
2,Why not the real thing?,"The Beatles have proven to be trans generation artists - I prefer playing my real Beatles albums to my 4 and 2 year old. They dance, sing, tap, and hum to it as much as I do - and I can be sure that one day they won't say, ""Hey - who are these guys covering those great kids tunes from my childhood?"" when they do hear the Beatles.I can understand wanting to have all ""kid friendly"" tunes together, but that is what your cd-burner is for! Sure I used to skip over Rocky Raccoon, but then I realised that my daughter was more focused on the possibility of a Raccoon named Rocky than the fact that some jealous guy was just [destroyed] in a bar!So I say go full strength with this stuff and get a couple of the original Beatles albums instead of this diluted version."
1,Not bad for a 2 yr. old...,"My 4 and 6 yr. old daughters love the REAL Beatles. I'm a major Beatles fan so my daughters have been lucky enugh to hear their music. What I do like is hearing kids sing Beatles songs. What I don't like is hearing kids PERFORM Beatles songs under adult direction. Unless you have really young children that have no comprehension as to who the real Beatles are -buy the original albums instead. Just make sure that you play the tamer songs - adult supervision is always the key. I felt that I couldn't honestly rate this album - at 31 yrs. old I found it be poorly put together and in bad taste- but my 1 yr.old niece tries to sing along and laughs at the children's voices- so in that respect, it can't be too bad for babies. True, it may satisfy the under 4 crowd, but older children should have the chance to hear the real thing - they'll appreciate it more."
2,avoid this if you're picky about being on key,"It is always cute to hear kids sing, especially favorites like these, and you expect them to be a little out of tune. But some of this songs are sung so badly off key I can't even stand to listen! So make sure that doesn't bother you before you buy this."
1,not so pleasant,"Not very pleasant to listen to, kind of grates on your ears. Especially when it's the kids singing! Maybe would be more fun with older children."
3,Beatles Would Be Better,"When I found this CD, I thought it would be great, I could listen to music that I actually enjoy, AND have a content three year old. Unfotunately, this is not the case. My daughter doesn't enjoy this! She's familiar with most of the songs as we are Beatles fans, but she really shows no interest in this disc at all. I was a little put off by the changes made to the original songs (like the addition of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" to ""All You Need is Love,"" but the tunes are catchy, and you can't help but sing to yourself."
1,This is just a ploy to make money.,"Kids all seem to go through a ""Beatles phase."" Every crop of children to come along since the '60s seems to learn Beatles songs in grade school. A lot of Beatles songs have BECOME kids' songs, as Ringo Starr makes clear when he says of ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""even embryos know this song."" In other words, if you want your kids to learn Beatles songs, why not let the Beatles sing them? Rather than listen to these cutesy-fied, limp, corny versions. This is just another ploy to make money off the Beatles with a ""tribute."" Why buy an imitation, when you can have the real thing? Nobody did these songs better than. . .The Beatles. This album should be titled after the Rutles satire album, ""All You Need is Cash."" Don't fall for it."
1,"horrible, children sing off key, slow, not catchey, boring,","Don't waste your money. My six year old hates it. The background music doesn't sound like Beatles music. You can hardly recognize the songs. The singing is by children who do their best but it's off key. The songs are slow and interminable. The tunes aren't catchy. The title was misleading to me because I thought it was a compendium of Beatles songs sung by the Beatles. Only the words remind me of Beatles songs, nothing else."
2,Kids would enjoy the real fab four better,"overall, I was disappointed in this CD. I had read a positive review. The original songs are short enough and clear enough that versions especially for kids are not necessary. However, some of the songs sung by kids (e.g. Dear Prudence) are poignant and nicely done. Raffi does a fine version of Octopus' Garden."
3,"SENATOR, THEY'RE NO JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE & RINGO!","This is one way to introduce little kids to the worlds best music. The Real Beatles is the best way. Even though this is well intentioned, there is no substitute for the real worlds number one band, the Beatles!"
2,Disappointing,"This is a very mixed bag. It has some awful singing, some OK singing and two completely unheard of and dull 'special guest stars'. Plus the music is badly played, losing a lot of the life of the original. I didn't like it, my wife said it's OK and our kid isn't old enough to state an opinion.I'd look elsewhere for kid friendly music. We've found some great kids music in the classical stuff Amazon sells."
1,Avoid this CD like the plague,"Almost anybody could have gotten karaoke tracks of various beatles songs,recorded their kids singing to them, and put it out as a CD -- and it would be as good or better than this thing.There is nothing about the arrangements or renditions that make these Beatles songs any more fun for kids than hearing the originals -- unless they enjoy hearing little tykes sing off key.It's truly amazing what people try to get away with these days.One final thought: I wouldn't be surprised if many of the positive reviews were written by friends of the producers."
4,The kids love it...and I like it too.,"My two kids love it --- my daughter since she was 1 and my son since he was 3 - and we've had it for about 6 months now. Ok not all the songs are so great and yes the Beatles sing it better then a bunch of kids do (but kids like hearing kids singing) and every once and a while I try to skip something but my son usually stops me and says ""No, I want to hear the ...whatever... song. "" They especially love ObLaDi, Octopus's Garden, Yellow Submarine, Birthday and All Together Now."
5,Beatles for kids,We listen to this cd at bedtime. My daughter loves it. Some of the kids voices are not what I prefer (love the original) but she enjoys it and thats all that matters.
5,My baby loves this!!!,"I love The Beatles, and wanted to expose my 15 month old to their music. This CD, with the exception of two songs, is sung by kids...it is sooo cute. I especially love the song Dear Prudence, it always surprises my little guy when the kids are calling for Prudence to come out to play."
5,"Sammy, The best!",This CD is worth every penny you pay for it. I am a true Rat Pack fan and this is just more of those days.Enjoy!!!
1,Broke.,"Less than 18 months old. Very lightly used. And it broke. ""Mechanical failure"" according to the tech guy. Sadly just beyond the year warranty. Not recommended. I've got a busted one to sell if you want...."
3,A Little Disappointing,"This book is great for simple meals, but it relies too heavily on processed foods. There are too many recipes that include a can of Healthy Choice Cream of Something Soup. Some recipes are identical except for one ingredient and a different title. The real value to this book is the calorie, fat, and fiber count, etc. The dessert and vegetable sections look great."
1,Is this healthy?,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. Joanna Lund's books do not contain healthy recipes, they are full of processed foods. The fat content may be low, but what about the sodium, sugar, and carbohydrate count. There are many other excellent crockpot cookbooks out there, that use real food."
1,"Easy, but not that impressive","I am glad I purchased this used for a cheap price. The recipes are surprisingly bland, especially the ones with Campbells condensed soups. If you are looking for easy, this is the one for you as long as you are willing to compromise on taste. A couple of the desserts were just a disaster (Pumpkin Custard, and a fruit cobbler)- texture and taste were awful! This book came recommended by a friend and now I am wondering if her taste buds are damaged. I would never recommend to a friend that I liked, I would be embarrassed."
5,easy to make,The crockpot recipes are easy and tasty. I would recommend this book to anyone limited on time but wanting to eat healthy.
4,healthy eats,"Hi, it's good to eat healthy and read about such. As I approach 50, I realize the need to watch what I eat. I gave up smoking again so eating better is the next logical step in a healthier lifestyle. This is not spiral bound, or at least the copy I got isn't. I received the paperback version and was disappointed so I am taking a star off for that. At the time I ordered it, it was supposed to be the plastic comb edition which would have been better to read in bed. God bless you, Dwayne"
5,Cupid Is the bomb!,"If you are looking for a scary movie this movie is the one to get. I have been a fan of Zach every since he started in movies. This movie is about a guy who is obsessed with cupid. To the point that he thinks he is cupid. He is out to look for his pices or ""his goddess of love."" He finds the perfect girl knowing that she is the one. He starts to kill everyone she knows off so that he and she will be happy forever. But she gets smart and she rejects him, and deadly measures start to happen. If you like great suspense and horror you'll love this movie. I give this movie two thumbs UP!"
3,24 inches wide?,How hard would it be to give 3 or 4 more inches my back window is 27 inches so I cannot use this. I'm sure I'm not the only one out there.
5,A Great View of America,This is a beautiful aerial photo journey done by a superb photographer with a solid historical sense.We use it as presentation gift to friends.
5,Best toy ever!!!,"My 3 yr old absolutely loves this toy!!! I had to buy more because when other children came over, this was the toy they all fought over!!"
3,No fun for us,"This product what not what I expected. I thought you put the pattern cards on the board and then lace through it. No, you look at the pattern card, but it has no holes. Then you poke the string through the plastic/rubberized board, but the string doesn't really go in and out. I couldn't really figure it out myself, so it wasn't fun for me or my child. And the punch broke after a few day, not sure if it got stepped on."
5,Bright and lovely,This is a CD you don't want to miss. An addition to your special collection of all time favorites. Miss Grant Murphy has a voice that is a pure delight of pleasure; a clear and lyricly treat to the senses. Her Choice of music is different and blends well from selection to selection. Her arrangement of The French Song and (Vanilla) Ice Cream is bright and underlined with wonderful humor. Miss Grant Murphy's rendition of If I Were A Bell is just that...a bell...clear and bright.Do your self a favor and order Times Like This. Bring an early spring into your life.
4,lovely,"Being an opera fan, I'm often disappointed by cross-over albums. I agree with one the of the other reviews that mentions Upshaw are being more successful in this type of repertoire. But Murphy is quite lovely. It was nice to hear a few pieces I was unfamiliar with like ""The French Song"" and ""Times Like This""... and I'm a sucker for ""Come to my Garden"" (even though I REALLY hated the boy soprano!). Overall, a very pleasant disc - perhaps not too deep on interpretation - but beautifully sung."
1,Not recommended,"This book was a textbook for a course on Business ethics. It was a mismatch for the course and, unfortunately, colors my opinion of the book. The book is slanted toward 'socially responsible' shopping, while avoiding/ignoring other drivers that affect our shopping choices. One-sided. Not recommended."
1,Dave Brubeck Quartet: Brubeck returns to Moscow,"The sound is very low, even with the tv turned up at top volume. I bought it for my husband, who is 94, loves Jazz, and the only thing he does is listen to music all day. He had trouble hearing it and then I listened to it also and the sound is not great."
2,To much talk and a few great moments,"Dave Brubeck is a great jazz piano player and he shows it by improvising on a Russian theme during an interview (one of the best moments, or minutes).Usually we see the concert and then can see complementary information in the ""extras"".In this case we see the extras and have a complementary show at the end...We see his arrival, his interviews, his rehearsals, meetings, etc... and when you are about to throw yourself out of the window you are rewarded with a few minutes of great music."
1,Brubeck Returns to Moscow,I was very disappointed with Brubeck Returns to Moscow. It was not typical Brubeck. It was Russian Mass music
2,"has its moments, mediocre at best.","While this movie has its moments such as great voice acting, good animation and action;it has its flaws. THose flaws are that some other characters in this film weird horribly colorful outfits, bad writing, Jimmy wears lady's clothes and shoes at the beginning of this flick, and Superman gets greatly weakened,beaten up way too much and doesn't fight as much as he does in previous movies that he is in. Do not get me wrong, Superman saves the day in the end, but this film is not executed very well because of its flaws. This movie would've been better if its flaws weren't present. 5/10"
4,Long time Super fan,"I have been a fan of Superman most my life and this movie was pretty awesome compared to past Superman animated films.My husband had been reading All Star Superman comic and really wanted to watch this movie so we bought it. He saidthe only trouble he had was them leaving out a few parts of the story that would have been really funny to watch.Honestly I felt a little choked up near the end, it was really touching if you have been a fan a long time anddont like to think of your hero being able to die.I would have given 5 stars but Tim Daly did not voice for this Superman and they left out some good stuff."
4,"Well done, but they left some things out.","The animation is good and the voice acting is great. However, When I saw that they left out some of the ""impossible feats""... I was very disappointed. The overall performance of what is there is great, though. I think if they would have extended the movie an extra 45 minutes, they could have included every possible thing. They did tease with images of the future Supermen, however they never really followed through with that part of the story. As a whole, It's good, and It's a nice translation of a comic book... How often do they actually get comic book movies 100% perfect anyways?"
4,"Liked it, BUT...","I am a huge fan of Superman so I enjoy pretty much any form of medium presented, to include this one. That said, if they were going to offer a different take on the big blue boy scout and tell a more serious story, I really wish they would have made it 20 minutes longer and adapted ""Superman: Secret Identity"" - to me, one of the best Superman stories ever told."
2,Messy & Patchy - Avoid Like Kryptonite!,"My first full length Superman animated feature has been incredibly unfulfilling. Have read bits of All Star Superman but it's never made an impression. The problem: trying to squeeze X # of characters and scenarios doesn't make this fly. It just creates an unfocussed, disjointed story. Luthor is about the only constant here (and I enjoyed him). But despite some credible Superman moments...the rest of this is disappointing. Spoiler: Superman dies at the end, but it's all pretty anti-climactic.Makes me yearn for the days of Christopher Reeves' Superman days, when storytelling was so much tighter and less contrived. Think I'll stick with Marvel animation and films!!"
2,Not that Super of a story.,With out spoiling the story there are several short stories to make up this film but at least 3 of the stories have no affect on the main plot. The DVD is about 1 hour and 15 minutes and the 3 stories not relevant are filler but poor material at that. I would rent this film or buy it if it reaches $5 or less.
2,booring,"I kept falling asleep, please make another GL movie or WW sequel and stop making all the Superman and Batman movies."
2,"Was looking forward to it, turned into a big ""ehhh"".","As others have said, the voice acting was a bit subpar. Lex Luthor was very well done, and Perry White actually wasn't bad, but everyone else sounded like they had the ""let me read this script in a microphone and get a check"" attitude. Very little chemistry.The scenes with Clark Kent weren't too bad and probably the saving grace of the movie. They kind of eluded to the reason that Clark acts so clumsy is to allow for distractions while he covertly uses his powers.I'm not a fan of the ""old school"" Superman, which is portrayed in this film. He's the ""all powerful, unlimited strength, unlimited intellect"" version. It makes him a fairly boring action character, so you have to rely on emotional challenges. Since the acting is played with very little emotion, you end up with a dull mess of a story.Disappointed. Glad I only rented it from Amazon :("
2,Weak entry in the DC film library,"I never read the comic books this is based on but as entertainment thisis pretty weak.It's incoherent,disjointed and in many sections just plain silly.It has some mature scenes and others that look like they were written for 8 yr olds.Much of it didn't make any sense.I suspected it could end up like this because Superman isn't the deepest character out there.Can't recommend this at all.This is 2 duds in a row for DC as the Shazam/Superman one was lame as well."
3,superman returns the sequel?,I must admit i was disappointed with this movie i'am a huge superman fan and i was hoping for a better movie then this somewhat disappointing movie. This movie is a step above superman returns another sorry movie that was and i do stress was a sad movie in the superman movie universe. If you want a movie that expores superman humanity and has little action in it then this is the film for you. but if you want a knock out slugfest filled doomsday type battle like in the superman doomsday movie then stay clear of this. the final battle were he fought lex luther was ok (lex luther gets the same powers that superman has) I just hope that the new superman movie that is coming out in the future ( i do not know when it is coming out) will be able to bring renewed life and bring fans back to one of the most beloved superheros of all time.
1,Just Awful Writing,"Just awful. Grant Morrison was, is and always will be a juvenile hack. So glad he's DC exclusive and not subjecting any character in the Marvel Universe to his infantile writing. The only time in the last quarter century that I stopped reading X-Men was when he and Chuck Austen were butchering the characters. I normally buy all DC animated projects but I'll be passing on this terd."
5,The Heart of Superman,"This movie hit the very core of Superman's character. It has many strong moments for all the characters and for Lex Luthor in particular. My true score for this movie would be 4.5, given an oddly stiff voice performance for Lois and one awkward storyline transition. Other than that, the movie was perfect and definitely the best animated Superman movie to date."
4,Now that's a Superman Story!,"This is a story true to the essence of Superman. Although the plot device is his powers, this story shows off the basic decency that defines the Man of Steel. I didn't want it to end, was hoping for more. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the voice acting wasn't great. Anyone who enjoys Superman for what he is, a symbol of hope and decency, will love this movie."
4,Superman: The greatest of all time!,"I am a huge fan of the Superman comicbook titles as well as the Superman All Star limited series. This movie will remind everyone why Superman is the greatest superhero of all time. Superman may have ""old fashion"" values (yes, I know that im talking about him as though he actually exist :) but I think these are values that we need in today's world. Even though its 2011, Truth, Justice and the American way still mean something."
3,its good,it gets the basic message of the storyline through. What i really liked were the side stories in the comic. Thats the first time i really enjoyed reading about jimmy olsen. I suggest buying the graphic novel because of the side stories and the incredible artwork of Frank Quitely.
4,Glad I got it,"I've been told to get this DC movie for a while so when I saw it on the cheap, I got it! The movie is good, even though I am not a big fan of Superman. It played as if it was brand new. I will buy again from this person."
4,Well Done,"Why can't they make a live action movie of Superman with this much depth? The first 2 Superman movie were good, but only the first movie ever lived up to the Superman of the comics....I hope Man of Steel is as good as this movie."
3,"Faithful adaptation, great animation, VERY weak voice acting","The thing that kept me from giving this DVD five stars is the weak performance of James Denton as Superman and Christina Hendricks as Lois Lane. Denton did not sound heroic, just his usual ""guy next door' charm which worked very well for Clark Kent but not for Superman. As for Hendricks, her Lois Lane was completely cold and unlikable. Save for the very end, I could not detect any trace of emotion in her performance. Only Anthony LaPaglia brought it for Lex Luthor. He's a talented actor and his Lex was fantastic. Otherwise, the movie is worth a solid watching and that's about it."
2,Horrid?,"Big fan of DC not much of Superman but still a fan.....except this movie! He is being portrayed as a complete weakling that is so clueless about everything, maybe this script would have worked in the 50's but not now. Stories jump from one spectrum to the other without reason, voices are not up to par with the characters and the score is unemotional and weak the artwork is great however too bad it was wasted on this story.Sorry guys I am dissapointed on this film, Superman was better portrayed on Public Enemies and other movies."
2,Not as good as previous movies.,Don't get me wrong. Definately interesting. It has it's good points but at times it gets really random. I suggest renting as opposed to purchasing.
1,Worst plot ever,"This must be the worst Superman movie from DC. The plot is just plain dumb.The movie is slow and pretty much action-less. The story is lame and introduces new characters without developing them. It also introduces old characters that unless you read the comics over the years, they will make no sense at all.The plot is so bad, I would not even recommend wasting the time watching it on free regular OTA TV.Wish I could get my money back ....BTW: I bet that most if not all the people who gave a 5 star to this crap have not seen the movie yet. There is no way anybody would thing that this movie was in any way good."
1,All*Star Spazman,"This movie suffered from waaay too many plot devices to push the story forward. The best part is Luthor on the Supes serum and all the different ways he would use things that Superman has, like super-strength and hyper intelligence. Unfortunately, it doesn't last very long and it is only in the very end of the movie."
3,so yes it's good movie...,"So i recently saw the movie and yes the writting for the movie was great and yes it conforms to everything that superman is...But just because he is alien doesn't mean he has to make a another great sacrifice for humanity i mean why does superman have to die. Have we gotten to point in our society that people doing great things even in the scope of a comic, that at some point their usefullness is moot...Their are so many other ways this movie could have gone but to kill him..Why I have to ask that question, why..."
2,"It was okay, with a few minor disappointments.","I didn't like Superman's costume in this movie. I mean, what's with the short cape?? And Clark was just wayyyy too clumsy in my opinion. And yes his voice as Superman just wasn't that strong; it didn't have that superhero tone to it. Oh and Lois! She seemed cold, like a woman scorned. And I really didn't feel any chemistry between her and Superman. I know this is an animated film, but I'm sorry, it just felt fake to me. I loved the Lex Luthor in this one though. The voice, his plot to kill Superman... all great!After being a fan of the Batman series and the Justice League series, I wish it could've been better coz I expected alot from this movie."
2,Weak story & not much cohesion based on the comic,"I've read the All Star Superman comic series and loved all of the DC Movies featuring Superman/Batman.However, this particular movie is a real Disappointment.It had no real cohesion to the comic's story and the unresolved ending was terrible.I agree with other reviewers who think that DC should focus on other characters especiallyif they are going to put out drivel like this one."
2,Don't Like It,They frankenstein a bunch of un-related stories into one movie. The stories don't make any sense to me either. I want my money back!
2,Wait until this goes on clearance,"I usually buy these DC releases w/ no reservations, but this one didn't hold my interest.The casting was off to me, the storyline was all over the road and if you make it through you'll feel cheated.This was a very long 76 minutes. I really can't recommend this.On the plus side, this is the first straight to DVD release that wasn't PG13 and didn't have any 4 letter words in it, except S.O.B., so my smaller guys will be able to watch this a little more often than some of the others.Again, I really wanted to like this. I just can't.I'll be back for the next one."
1,Terrible from the word go,"I'm a fan of animated superhero cartoons. This was one of the most dissapointing offerings I have had the misfortune of watching. The only passable aspect of this DVD is the animation, everything else (voice acting, plot, use of established characters) will have you wondering how this ""animated movie"" was ever made. There are a lot better animated superheo titles out there. Skip this one and try X-Men the series, Wolverine and the X-Men series, Spiderman the Animated Series, Justice League, the Batman 90's cartoon series or the Spectacular Spiderman series."
1,There goes an hour of my life,"I watched this movie two weeks ago and I have to say I had already forgotten a lot of it. While reading other Amazon reviews every time someone mentioned a character I was thinking who? This movie jumps from one plot to another every two minutes which makes it impossible to really remember what was going on in this movie in the first place. I was facepalming my way through most of this. A lot of characters are introduced that serve absolutely no purpose in this movie and the final battle is just ridiculous. I felt like Lois Lane was an idiot, I mean every time she did something it felt like I was screaming in my head that she's an idiot."
1,ALL- STAR SUPER CRAP,"Ive been a fan of superman since I was a child and admire the numerous cartoons that came out throughout the years but this ""ALL STAR SUPERMAN "" story line is garbage and the plot was amazingly stupid and the writer should be shot... don't waste your time watching this garbage SUPERMAN fans, this movie doesn't do any justice for SUPERMAN!!"
1,dumb,"Really dumb. Just because the story's source is a comic, does not give it an excuse for so so so many dumb, ridiculous moments. That's two terrible animated DC movies in a row. Cross your fingers for Emerald Knight."
2,Completely Disconnected Storyline,"I am an avid fan of the DC animated series, but the plot of ""all star"" totally lacked any kind of cohesion. New characters just randomly appear, too much crammed into one DVD."
4,"Needed more development, sould have been a series","I liked the movie very much--it was very entertaining. However, they tried to put so much material into it that it really lacked some of the plot development it needed to carry through all of the points within it. There was so much here that it would have made more sense to turn it into a full-fledged season of a TV show or a longer mini-series at least. I don't want to get into spoilers, so I will simply say there are definite breaking points throughout that could have been developed into full-fledged features on their own. I would be interested in seeing this same idea in an expanded format."
5,All Star Movie,"Before I give my review just know that I am a huge fan of DC's animated line of movies. Now after seeing what a huge disappointment Superman Doomsday was, I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about All Star Superman. But wow what an incredible movie. Lex Luthor is the main antagonist in this movie and he really tests Superman. This is making me want the next DC animated movie to be a Superman one. I recommend you read the comic this is based off of. I read it once I had gotten the movie and that was one of the best comics I've read. Two thumbs up and five stars here. Watch it you'll love it."
2,Disjointed,"Every ten minutes the narrative takes an unexpected turn -- not in a good way. Deus ex machina would be one thing, but here the viewer encounters a whole pantheon of contrivances. Annoying, and barely entertaining enough to have running in the background while doing work."
4,Just what my roasts need,"To give a little more information than is on the Amazon site, this rack is reversible, so that there is a choice between 3/8 and 1/2 inches for the height the roast is raised above the bottom of the pan. Also, I e-mailed the company to answer a couple of questions and was told that this product can go up to 572 degrees F (300 degrees C) in the oven no more, and it is oven safe and dishwasher safe. In a second e-mail to the company on May 2, I learned that the rack is made of chrome, and the company is saying that it will not rust."
5,Very nice quality broiler rack.,"I have several pans that did not come with racks that I like to use when roasting. The ones I've tried to purchase in the stores are either too long, wide or both. This fits perfectly in my 13X9 pans. Nice quality and the shipping was very fast. Great price too."
5,Does the job!,"This was much sturdier than I expected for the size. I wish they made it larger, but it is what it is. Overall, a good addition to my kitchen."
5,The Big Picture,"So often, we tend to think of the near-extinction of the Bison as having been solely caused by overhunting by the fur trade. This book shows the intensely interwoven cause and effect relationships that led to massive changes, not only for the Bison, but for the Native Americans as well. The scope of this book is so much larger than just the destruction of the Bison - it addresses the full range of effects that Westward Expansion had on the plains. To gain a better understanding of the ecological dynamics at play between the Bison, the indigenous tribes, the settlers and the environment - this book is a must."
3,how can this be low fat?,"I was introduced to sweetened condensed milk at an early age though we always used only a spoonful of it when there was a craving and the rest of the can went to waste. Many Southeast Asian desserts call for an entire can of the stuff. Reading pinay cooking blogs, I noticed fresh fruit gets sweetened with this stuff but at the same time, I'm watching Ina Garten on tv spooning white chocolate sauce over berries recently purchase at the farmer's market. She has friends coming over. LOL. In the past few years, I've noticed the popularity of white chocolate sauce as if WHITE chocolate sauce was a luxury foodstuff. It's got no cacao in it though. What is white chocolate? Hmm some kind of dairy fat sugar cocoa butter and what does it taste like? Is it acrid, overly sweet, cloying?"
2,Not that great,It looks kind of cheap. But then again it is cheap. Buy it only if you need a big cheap rug.
4,Not heavy enough,"The rug is lovely and well made. However is is very light and I can not get it to lay down on my carpet. I hate to put 2-way tape on my new carpet, and yet I can not afford to spend another $100 on a non stick padding so that it will lay flat.This is the first time I have ordered something like this on the internet and I guess I should have known more about carpet before I ordered it. Seller needs to put something in their ad that says it is not as heavy as most area rugs."
3,Fun but unstable,"We got this castle for our 2 and 5 yr old girls for Christmas. It was very easy to put together, but it falls apart every time the girls play with it (which is several times a day). The construction relies on tiny magnets and wooden slots to hold the pieces together. A slanted roof is supposed to stay on just with the support of 2 magnets. It has never stayed on for more than 5 seconds. We tried to tape it at first, but gave up and just got rid of that piece eventually.The kids don't seem to mind, and they fill the castle with their Papo figures and play every day."
1,Would have been a great gift if we could have gotten it together!,"Purchased this for my 5 year old as a Christmas present. When my husband opened the box it was obvious it wasn't going to be an easy assembly. As he was putting it together, one of the pieces of wood actually split while trying to screw them together. Winded up packing it back up and shipping the item back. Replaced it with the already put together Melissa & Doug castle which my daughter loves. She originally saw this one in the toy store and wanted it, but after the hassle of trying to put it together and having it break, it was easier to go with another model."
1,Nothing New - Same Old German/SS Bashing,"This book has absolutely nothing new to add to the existing knowledge base about the history or background of the SS.Matter of fact, there were quite a few inaccuracies and falsehoods, that one must wonder if it was sloppy work or intentional. This was written by someone who was far removed from the subject and just rehashed a lot of old news and old propaganda.If you want to read a book that panders to those who love to hate the SS, then this is it. For serious students of the subject, look elsewhere."
2,Lacking,"Its very lacking and he does a lot of guess work instead of putting down historical accuracies. Stick with Soldiers Of Destruction, i found that a book worth reading over and over again."
2,"Too much politics, not enough storytelling","Tariq Ali has clearly moved a considerable distance from his fiery youth as a student leader - so far, indeed, as to appear at some moments in this book as an apologist for the DDR. Almost every page seems to have some kind of polemical point to make and it gets in the way of character development if not plot. All to clearly, it is easy to see the points he is making in this book. Don't blame the people of the DDR, they wanted an idealistic society but somehow it all went wrong. Well, not for nothing was there no equivalent of Hungary 1956 or Prague 1968 in Berlin. Put kindly, perhaps the whole of DDR society was in a state of shock following WWII - but for 40 years? I think not. This could have been a fascinating tale, but as I say, Ali's desperation to make his polemical points gets in the way with depressing regularity."

5,Excellent replacement battery,"I purchased this battery as a replacement for the original info lithium battery that came with my Sony Mavica FD91. It is fully compatible with the info lithium system and has about 35% more compacity than the original battery. It gives accurate minute by minute estimates of remaining battery life, and adjusts the estimate according to operating mode, eg: stills, movie, playback, flash, etc. It was difficult to find a replacement battery for this camera, originally manufactured in 1998, so I am happy to have a good replacement that has more compacity than the original battery."
4,From a Great Movie,"C'mon, it's music from the Ghostbusters. What's not to like? Bernstein at his finest. Besides, who else are ya gonna call? ... Ah'm just sayin' ..."
2,Blackhawk Fans Beware,"I bought the ""5"" disc Special Edition set that has Game 5 of the Nashville series and all four (4) wins in the Finals against the Flyers from NHL.com. The DVD video quality is very poor, even when playing on a BlueRay player that does a great job of upconverting the image. The games look like those 1970 football games they show on the NFL Network. Very poor video quality when they show the long distance shots, like poor VHS quality. Close up images are not too bad. I am keeping it because they have all four wins showing the compelete game (with no commercials and no intermissions) and I want it until the package comes out on BlueRay HD format. Guess having teh wins in poor quality is better than not having them at all but if I would have know they were this poor of quality before I bought it, I would definitely NOT have bought it. Save your money until the HD version comes out."
2,No extra anything,"Don't get me wrong...all the games are there. It was obvious to me, however, they put next to no effort into the production of this set. There is no extra footage included, no pre-game analysis or interviews, the editing seems to favor saving time to the extreme...it cuts out most replays and shows the face off immediately following a play stopping whistle. I understand this may be what some people are looking for so they don't have to skip forward past the stuff they don't want to see, however I would like to at least have the option to see some of the stanley cup hype that brings me back to this awesome season. Don't expect anything but game play with this set and it will be what you expect."
5,Lord Stanley has finally comeback to Chicago,"Great Blu Ray - As a life long Blackhawks fan, i could not wait to get my hands of this. Well produced and gave the flavor of the Hawks Season. The video has interviews with most the players and management and nice game highlights especially during the playoffs. The Disc also has special features such as Behind The Scenes With The Stanley CupExtended Locker Room Stanley Cup CelebrationExtended Chicago Parade Celebrationi do wish the blu ray had more extras though (maybe more interviews with former players on what this stanley cup meant?) I do know though there is a special edition coming on later this year so i am excited/ must have for any blackhawks fans"
5,Hawk Stanley Cup DVD,"A great dvd for any fan of the Black Hawks as it is a great recap of the marvelous Stanley Cup Championship. It has a wondeful recap of the season including many highlights, but the playoff coverage is splendid. In particular, the highlights of the Stanley Cup Finals against Philedelphia is marveous. It is a blast to watch it over and over. A must have."
1,Blackhawks Great! - DVD Horrible!,"I'm a Blackhawks fan, and by the overall appearence of this DVD, I'd say it was put together as quickly as possible and on a shoestring budget! Production values were awful, choice of highlights poor to average, narration just so-so. I'd rate this DVD a waste of money, a waste of time, a waste product!"
1,Very slow shipping!!!,"I will have waited over a month by the time I get this thing in the mail. Still Hasn't shipped and no sign of it doing so either. Agree with other review, If it isn't in stock don't sell it!!!"
1,do not ever buy from this vendor 0 stars if I could,they are the worst... ordered jul 28 its now oct 9th and still is being delayed... no excuses... just keep improving my shipping... they are crap complete utter crap
1,NEVER IN STOCK - NEVER SHIPS - WHY IS IT STILL LISTED???,"Just for fun, I'm going to continue to leave this order in tact. I have no doubt that this order will not ever ship."
5,So much growth here... WOW!!!,"Her 1st cd was 100% purrfect, her latest one is 110% purrfect!!!! WOW not only does she look like a 1950's pinup girl, she sings in an authentic 1950's style, full of energy, and her voice full of charisma. She has a gift, a true stage presance. Her band is tight as usual and the songs are great, you couldn't ask for a more perfect rockabilly cd, by a modern female singer, who is a throwback to the 1950's pinups, and singers... the only thing that could have made this cd more perfect is if Kim were laying on the hood of a 54 Chevy, on the cover of the cd."
2,paid 2.95 and worth it!,"Im a huge rockabilly fan, old and new - but this CD did not do it for me. The band is good, the material is well written but the vocals just dont hold up. She sounds weak on some numbers and her intonation is questionable on others. Could be a style thing - I'll stick with Wanda Jackson."
2,not much growth here,"well, i listened to the new one by kim and its not much better than the previous. the band is tight as usual. the music is good. but i feel that the vocal could be WAY better. if you want wanda jackson than go buy wanda. it seems like shes trying way too hard to sound some way, just like the first record. i appreciate what shes trying to do. theres not alot of new female rockabilly talent out there.i just wish it was better. i know all the rockabillies will go buy it though because she's the trendy female vocalist, like big sandy is to the guys. i'll stick to the old school stuff til something better comes along."
4,Maximum Boy in... Invasion from the Planet of the cows!,"In Invasion from the Planet of the Cows, Maximum Boy confronts a barn-shaped UFO.The general, Bossy, comes out.She says""we want to check on the cows we dropped here a few hundred years ago"".When Maximum Boy asks ""do you come in peace?""Bossy says, ""We COME in peace. How we LEAVE depends on what we see"".If you like a funny book with funny names but not all humor,I recommend the Maximum Boy series.All my friends have them and they are very happy with them. As soon as my teacher finished Invasion from the Planet of the Cows,I started begging my dad for them.If you like funny stories that include a little suspense that you can read in a day,I recommend the Maximum Boy series: something that every family should have."
4,Good Reference Source,"This comprehensive nine-volume DLB volume scales down the Beat literary phenomenon to a canonical seven-person movement: Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Neal Cassady, Gregory Corso, John Clellon Holmes, and Gary Snyder. The volume begins with the introductory chapters ""The Beats in New York City"" and ""The Beats in the West,"" and proceeds with substantial biographical chapters for each of the seven Beat writers. Each biographical chapter includes a ""Primary Bibliography"" section that can be useful for confirming publication information (i.e. publisher and date) for revised or expanded titles. The volume also includes numerous black-and-white photographic reproductions of early Beat Generation imprints. Examples of such imprints are front cover images of first editions, and original personal documents (e.g. Neal Cassady's farewell notes to Carolyn, p. 350, 356)."
1,Stinko!,"At first we really liked this tea kettle. It is really nice looking and was boiling water like a champ. After having the kettle for 3 weeks, I was boiling a full kettle of room temp water for baby bottles and there was this hiss/pop. The bottom totally cracked off and basically fell out. All of the water seeped into our stove top (did I mention is was about 1am) and created a big mess. Oh well, Amazon is great about returns but we are disappointed that it wasn't a better buy in the first place."
2,Introduction to Materials Management Textbook,I found this Textbook on Materials Management not to be very current with respect to the subject. Many of the common functions of Materials Management were not covered at all in this textbook. I received this Textbook in a very damaged state due to delivery. I would check out another Textbook than this one if you are just getting started in the Business!
4,Basic Supply Chain,This book has an easy written language and is very good for beginners in the Supply Chain Management Area.
4,Great Buy,"I'm gonna keep this short and to the point. This is a great mp3 player for its price. The Creative Zen Touch comes close but does not offer many of the features this thing has such as built in recording, picture viewing, etc. [...]"
1,1 star on the poor customer service,Mine 1st unit was defective and I am awaiting the second. Just wanted to post how awful the IRIver technical customer service rep was on the phone. Immediately very rude and short with me as if helping customers wasn't part of his job description. My threshold for returning the unit now is very low.
1,Received Defective Unit - No Technical Support,"Unit would not charge. Contacted iriver tech support, waited on hold for 45 minutes, no answer.Sent email. No reply.Called again, no answer.Second email. No reply. Returning to Amazon. Not happy with customer service. Unit looks nice but doesn't work."
2,"Good player, bad firmware/software","I purchased the iRiver H320 20 GB Player and quickly returned it for a full refund. The player is great if you want to drag and drop your music files. It does work with Windows Media Player but does not 'sync'. This is a huge downside to this player. This makes it very difficult to create playlists, etc. The FM Radio has the best reception that I've seen in conjunction with an MP3 player. I did not try to store and access digital photos. The color display was nice. The controls are a bit difficult to manage."
2,Bleh,Obviously the people who gave this five stars have never used an Ipod or iTunes. The software for this devcie is clunky at best. The controls are terrible. The screen is murky and the entire device is cheap and plasticky feeling and looking. Is this really the best iRiver can do?
5,More than adequate for this audiophile!,"I got my H320 shortly after Christmas 2004. I had originally gotten a RCA Lyra 20 GB from my Mom for Christmas. It sounded good, but it didn't seem very reliable. I took it back and got a Creative Zen Xtra NOMAD 40 GB. That one didn't sound very good at all. That's when I got the H320. I must say that I am very satisfied with this product! It sounds excellent, it's easy to use, and it hasn't given me one problem yet! The battery life is great too! Whenever I buy my next MP3 player, I definitely plan on getting another iRiver!"
1,Never received Item,"I ordered this dock from Carrot Idea in July. They took the money off my debit card and never sent me the dock. It is still showing ""in process"" on their website and it is November. I have emailed customer service numerous times with no response. I reported them to the BBB. There is no phone number to contact them either"
2,"Worked well for a year, then cable came loose from plug","After some issues getting the item delivered from CarrotIdea, it did finally arrive. The item worked well for over a year, but now the cable has started to come loose from the plug that connects to the shuffle. Some small wires are now sticking out and the cable is no longer recognized by the USB of any computer.I have not really been able to find any other options that are better which work for the 2nd generation and work with the shuffle's case."
3,Just Ok,"I like Brookner's style. As an American and not a scholar, I find her books a challenge and her English traits very interesting. This book was pretty typical and really good writing. I made it to the end and there was quite an emotional buildup. It turned out to be a big letdown though and I felt like the main character Kitty ended up being unrealistically dense. I just can't believe she wouldn't see the writing on the wall at some point. It just turned out to be really pathetic. That said, I have thought about the book quite a bit after reading it and there was an intermingling with Romance literature that is intriguing.I recommend Hotel Du Lac for first time Brookner readers."
1,"It was written, but why?","This is indeed another of the Warlock series, but it doesn't advance anything. It was like reading about the time I went to the store to buy bread. It was an activity, but it did little to advance any of the characters. I picked it up as the latest in the Warlock series and I realised what I liked about the original books. The modern approach to mideval attitudes and lifestyles. I really got tired of wading through the ancient wording and turn of phrase.If you like to read a manuscrpt written in old english, then you will love this. Otherwise, skip it."
3,Warlock Redux,"If you enjoy the Warlock series of books you should enjoy this. Personnally i think Stasheff stretched HERE BE MONSTERS from a good short story into a full book. While it promises the mass wedding of the Warlock children. All it really does, is deal with the latest crisis. With the wedding not even really happening. I thought this was going to be Excellent. But IMO it's nothing but another mediocre novel in the series. Stasheff is capable of great work. This is'nt one of them."
5,great teaching tool,"Have used this book in teaching many times and find it to be fantastic. It was in great shape, like new."
3,Latte Trouble - Book #3 Coffeehouse Series,"Latte Trouble, by Cleo Coyle is book #3 of the Coffeehouse Mystery Series. I have enjoyed the first two books in this series however, the ending to this book was similar to many cozy mysteries I have read before. I found that disappointing.In this installment Clare Cosi and her staff are busy as The Blend is hosting a private party during Fall Fashion Week, featuring a new line of Java Jewelry. During the party one of the guests is poisoned and dies while drinking a Latte. Tucker, one the The Blend's Barista's is suspected. Clare investigates and hopes to find the real killer so that Tucker will be free.One of the best things about this series are the recipes. If you are ready for a fun mindless read, the Coffeehouse Mysteries are recommended."
4,"Easy, fun mysteries",These coffee house mysteries are just plain fun to read. The characters are just a bit off-beat but real enough to capture the reader. I have enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more.
4,Latte Fun!,"A fun exploration of the New York fashion scene and coffee-house! Claire is fully developed as a strong, but wonderfully flawed woman, trying to hold her job, family and life together despite major challenges. This book balances Claire's personal trials/triumphs with the drama and excitment from the murder of a guest in her coffee house during Fashion week. Can't wait for my next expresso shot and another book!"
2,Not what I expected,"As a reader of Christian fiction, I'm not sure why this popped up in my recommendations, except maybe it's classified as chick-lit. While the story has it's good points, and rolls along at a nice pace, I certainly could have done without the foul language (it adds nothing to the story). Granted it's not extreme, but occurs often enough to have made the series of three distasteful to me. Add in the main character's complicated 'divorced but still in lust with each other relationship' with her ex-husband, and her concurrent fascination with another character who 'happens' to be married... and I'm sure you get the picture. I did read to the end, but didn't bother with the two that followed in the series. I prefer something a little more entertaining (read: witty) and a lot more uplifting."
3,Cute Series,"I love the ambiance of this series, which makes me feel like I'm sitting in the Village Blend myself among all the quirky characters.I just wish the author would tone down the coffee tidbits and history a bit. It seems that she's repeating the same ones from book to book, and with such a short series, it's not really that hard to remember something you've already read when you see it again.I was also disappointed that she didn't flesh out the storyline with Joy a bit more. Finding her in the bathroom seemed like a climactic moment in the story, but then nothing was ever said about it again after she told Matteo to ""talk to her."""
4,"Victims Become Suspects, Suspects Become Victims","In this 3rd outing, Cleo opens up the Village Blend for New York Fashion week. On the evening of Lottie Harmons party Tuckers ex-boyfriend is poisoned by a drink that was intended for Lottie. Cleo takes it upon herself to prove Tuckers innocence only to get in the middle of something that is much bigger then she is. This story stumbles and twists along (with a couple of editing mistakes) until the twisted ending in which you have to be paying attention to get all the complexities. Not to mention whether Matteo is really wanting to change or not. I enjoy this series, the characters are familiar and it's nice to revisit them."
5,Great service,Fine battery at a good price. The service was wonderful- only took two days to get here
1,not intended for navgational purposes,"This map is vastly inferior to use as a practical driving guide because in my opinion the map and print size are too small plus many little towns and roads are left out which you might want to use when exploring which causes confusion while navigating. The San Jose city map was not helpful because it does not indicate the direction of the many one way streets. Information in the most side boxes was too broad, misleading and with few helpful phone numbers. Space would have been better used creating a more functional map. I wasted my $ on this one but fortunately had packed a far better one as well."
3,Not Consistant,"I purchased 3 of these in November of 2010. I do day long shoots and they had performed as expected. About 2 weeks ago, I was doing a 3 hr evening shoot and one of the batteries ""died"" after about 45 minutes. I quickly switched to another battery and finished the evening. When I got back and put the ""dead"" battery in the camcorder it worked just fine. I will now mark it as defective and only use it for setup and testing but no longer for production.Also, all 3 batteries give ridiculous run time estimates when they are charged. They battery time indicator shows 2,000+ minutes. I still have 3 original Sony 750's purchased in 2004 and they show an expected 400 +/- minutes when charged. In summary I think that this is an inexpensive OK product but not up to the quality of the original Sony batteries."
2,Le Corsaire Richard Bonynge,This version is good but it doesn't bring the music of he Pax de Due from Corsaire which is very beautiful and I bought this CD and when I have at home I realized that. I think Amazon needs someone to explain about the different s version for the client best decision.Adam: Le Corsaire
3,It's &quot;OK&quot;,"I enjoy using this, but it hurts my back sometimes. The center circle deal that is suppose to be in the center of your back never stays in place!! My baby is 12 lbs and boy does this do a job on my back during out 20 minute walk!!"
3,Try it before you buy it,"I was excited about receiving this carrier as a gift because I envisioned carrying my baby around everywhere--while I did household chores, ran errands, and going for walks with my husband. Very quickly I realized that it was a major ordeal to just get the dang thing on! The only really accurate way to make the adjustments on all the different straps and hooks is with the baby IN the carrier, and we all know what happens when you mess with a 5 mo. old too much. Another problem is that when you face them out, the back support is supposed to fold down, but ours keeps popping up right in our daughter's face. She just chews on it mostly, but I'd rather it didn't do this.<br /><br />One good thing is that my daughter LOVES being in it (once we get going). When she was facing me, she usually fell asleep, but as she has gotten older, she loves to face out and see the world. I would recommend finding someone who has one and trying it out before you buy it."
1,Buckles that don't stay locked makes this a risk to baby.,"[ASIN:B00013278Y Infantino Euro Rider in Khaki and Black]Irrespective of the color and pattern, this product can easily turn dangerous when a buckle unlatches unexpectedly. I gave my daughter one of these for her baby shower. When she used it for the first time, she realized that the major buckles that secure baby did not lock. My granddaughter almost landed on the floor.This is not an isolated case, as I read on the Target web-site that several mothers had similar experiences. Beware."
3,Good for Marriage Prep,I know this priest personally and the book is a great resource for couples about to be married. The only reason it is not rated higher is that I personally got a lot of this info directly from the author! Lots to think about in here!
2,Just alright!,I thought it was alright. Kinda confusing yet funny too. It just didn't grab my attention like others have. The excitement wasn't there for me.
4,I wish these ladies were MY aunts!,"I've re- read they first 2 pages so often, I think I've memorized them. And still I laugh. The relationships between the two sisters, and the youngest sister and her husband are terrific. The plot is average, some tangled relationships and convenient events detract from the solution, but you'll love the characters and the setting."
1,Murder on a Girls' Night Out,"If I had to describe this book with one word it would be UNLIKELY! I found the two to be unlikely sisters, both in appearance and personality - though I do understand that even twins can be markedly different and that it's hard, if not impossible to escape our childhood roles and be able to interact as mature adults - but the fact that the inherently impulsive Mary Alice dominates the much smarter Patricia Anne was hard to swallow. I wanted to scream at Mouse to GET A BACKBONE! The plot itself was also unlikely - the complex interrelationships were so far removed from reality that I had to wonder about Anne George's disfunctional background.....Surely life in Birmingham, Alabama is not this far-fetched."
4,Delightful,"This is the first in Anne George's Southern Sisters mysteries. The sisters are two 60-ish ladies in Alabama, one (Patricia Anne)on the quiet side - the other (Mary Alice) more outrageous. In this first book, Mary Alice buys a Country Western line dancing bar and the trouble starts before she even opens. Characters are good; the plot is easy to follow and interesting; it's hard to put down; humor is abundant. This book won an Agatha Award, and rightly so. A good book to cuddle up with and let Ms. George entertain you."
3,3.5 Stars: Cute little vacation book!,"I enjoyed reading this delightful little story on my vacation! While I didn't ""laugh until I cried,"" I was very amused at the antics of these two southern sisters. Since I live in Alabama, I especially enjoyed all the references to the Birmingham landmarks. This novel started out rather slow but I admit to reaching a point where I didn't want to put it down; I couldn't wait to see who was murdering these people. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series!"
5,"FUN, Y'ALL","How can you beat a light mystery, set in the south, with 2 loving sisters, of completely opposite personality, always gettinginto some sort of mess"
4,easy reading,This is a fast easy read. Very entertaining. Some of it made me laugh outloud. I could relate to the sisters as I have two and we do things together.
4,Fun Reading,"I thoroughly enjoyed Murder on Girls' Night Out. I am reading the entire Anne George series. The descriptions make the characters real, the story keeps moving, with bits of humor thrown in. When I finish one book, I can't wait to get into the next one."
5,Sibling rivalry of the most humorous kind.,"Never have two sisters been such polar opposites and never have two been so amusing when solving murders of every kind. In this episode of the ""Southern Sisters"", Mary Alice's plans for starting a new business are turned around when a dead body is discovered at the Scoot 'N Boot country western bar. Undaunted,she teams with her sister to solve the murder. Laugh a minute, and a quick read."
2,Decent story ruined by an awful ending,"Patricia Ann and Mary Alice are sisters and complete opposites. But when the man who sold Mary Alice a C&W; bar is killed there the next night, the sisters find themselves trying to prove the murderer is not one of Patricia Ann's former students.Surprisingly interesting, since Mary Alice is an overbearing know-it-all and Patricia Ann lets her dictate large chunks of her life. But it kept me reading up to the awful deus-ex-machina ending and explanation that mostly relied on information that had NOT been given to the reader, which bitterly disappointed me and is the reason for the low rating."
5,"Loved it,loved it, loved it!",This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. The relationship between the sisters is marvelous--I'm a younger sister and feel just like this! A terrific read!
3,"Cozy--yes, mystery--maybe","If you love a good mystery, be warned. There's very little sleuthing, and the solution comes tumbling out in what amounts to an info-dump or two. The end of the book feels rushed and I couldn't buy the last minute god-in-the-car rescue. That's the bad.Here's the good: characterization is deftly written, descriptions at times are downright luminous (without being obtrusive), and George's dialog rings true throughout the book. I enjoyed the leisurely pacing of the first 3/4 of the book. I enjoyed the 60-something sisters with their preoccupation with family and home life. I expect I'll try out another book or two in this series to see how it goes. I'd give it another half star if I could."
5,Excellent,"Timely delivery, well packaged. Completely new and ready for use. No shadow images or accidental exposure. Great paper quality. 100 sheets really lets you forget about not having enough paper and print at your leisure."
1,Very shallow,"First part explains option trading platforms and order routing, and is very confusing. The interviews with option traders in the second part mostly concentrate on differences between electronic trading and trading on the floor. The rest of the book is a very basic description of what options are and what technical analysis is. That's it. Nothing in the book can be used for option trading."
3,"An OK overview, but superficial","I guess this book is meant as a real ""intro"" text, but if you do know something about this art, it seems pretty lite. Clearly, lots of people like it, but Weintraub seems to bend so far over to make complex work accessible that she really over-simplifines. And the ""art"" in the book is so scattered and uneven, you don't get any deeper sense of what is going on, what the historical context of any of this might be.Granted, there aren't many intro texts on recent art. So if this is one of the ""better"" ones, it's mostly for lack of competition. I wish there was some accessible middle ground between pop/gossip texts and academic tomes. This feels like it's written from someone really distant to the work, who's not always that well-informed."
2,Very Dissapointing,"A poor text. The author takes an uncritical and overly romantic stance on the various artist's work. While the artists included represent some of the very best examples of avante-garde practices spanning three decades, including several to whom I had would not have otherwise been exposed, the write ups read like publicity for their shows rather than critical analysis of the work. Most disappointing was the structure. Each artist is pigeon-holed into the demographic category they fall within, e.g. Felix Gonzales-Torres: A Latin, Homosexual Man. While I respect the effort to include a diverse range of artists, the demographics appear to be placed above the significance of their body of work. A difficult issue to address, and this book does so poorly."
1,Terrible writing and terrible art.,"I can't believe that there are so many positive reviews for this book. Aside from any personal preferences, did anyone else notice that the text is FULL of grammatical mistakes? Even the artists' names are not spelled consistently the same way throughout an article. If you don't believe me, count the number of times she uses Mesa-Bains and then the number of times she uses Mesa-Baines.Aside from that, the writing style is simply awful, although I guess with this kind of subject matter, it's hard to do much better. This book, along with my Studio Art class, has helped me to develop a strong disliking for most of the contemporary art that is gaining attention. It is thoroughly disturbing and pointless. None of the artists manage to successfully convey their messages. I am very glad to never have to see this book again."
4,Out of the box art,Read this book for a non-traditional studio class and it was a great introduction to many contemporary artists I did not know.
4,nice mix of international R&B/soul,"I generally like the Putumayo cds, and this one is no different. It has a nice mix of R&B/soul (with a little hip hop and funk through in for good measure). Putumayo has gotten much better about annotating the music. The accompanying booklet has a picture of each artist, the country, a brief description of the artist, and a translation of a few keys lines of lyrics. I particularly liked TID's song Zeze. Highly recommended."
4,The Perfect Groove,I was at the Field Museum gift shop in Chicago and after grooving to the music they were playing for the 20 minutes I was in the store I stopped and asked what it was. It was Global Soul. This album has undeniable funk that is smooth and mellow but at the same time will groove you enough you can motivate. Global Soul is the perfect blend of the perfect grooves.
1,Worthless,I bought this battery for my wifes camera. It was shipped promply and was in good shape. But that was the end of it. I put it on the charger (Shipped not charged) let it go for the required time and nothing. So I thought it was the charger so I bought another charger and the same thing nothing. Totally worthless product.
4,Good Replacement Batteries,"These batteries appear to perform as well as the original batteries supplied with the camera, a Canon Powershot S20. Recommend!"
3,Looks good.. Function so so..,I had bought this set based on looks.. It has a nice feel and look to it.. The keyboard works fine but my mouse doesn't click.. The left mouse click needs to be pressed about 3 times before it clicks.. Over all it's ok.. Find another I would suggest..
4,bigbass66,found item as advertised so far works great found price was right just to buy the mouse was more then the keyboard and mouse together. when used with x brand laptop stand found was unbeatable combination..makes using laptop totally fun..
1,Space bar becomes a problem,"I've had this keyboard for at least 6 months,maybe more. Everything was working fine for about 3 months, when something happened with the space bar - it started making a clicking noise and it doesn't space unless you put your thumb to the left of center. One day when I was at Fry's I popped a space bar off the similar model there to see what it was like underneath. There is a metal bar that spans the space bar underneath and it fits fits inside some plastic that holds it. I came home and snapped my space bar off and I thought I fixed it. But, it didn't stay that way. Really a pain to type! Now, my mouse is also having difficulties. It tracks okay, but it doesn't always 'click'. I definitely wouldn't buy this again!"
2,"Great ergonomics, poor build quality","Typically a keyboard lasts me for years. My first desktop 6000 had to be retired after one year because several keys of the left side of the keyboard stopped working reliably. I never spilled anything on it, tried moving channels in case it was interference, etc., but the conclusion was simply: bad hardware. I love the ergonomics of the product, the touch of the keys, and the battery life beats my brother's Logitech by a mile."
2,Look For A Different One,"I have been using the combination keyboard and mouse for about a year now. The keyboard works fine, but the mouse has recently started losing it's ""left click"" ability, and I get random errors warning of a low-battery, even after replacing both batteries. I'm moving on to another brand/model."
4,GREAT KEYBOARD & MOUSE,It is such an improvement over old keyboard & mouse. Now I can get to sites a lot faster with out all that wainting. I am glad I bought the set.. It was a lot different than old & took a while getting used to it. Well pleased
2,"Spotty reception, good build","The keyboard's shift key was quite sticky for me. It typed well, as microsoft keyboards tend to do, but the reception quality was sub-par.I had reception problems with both the keyboard and the mouse. I have since then gone through a Kensington Pilot Board (same poor results) and am currently using the Logitech S530 (which is awesome!) on my mac mini."
4,A VISUAL TREAT,"As always in the Bible, when we return to the story of David and Goliath we are struck not just by its power but by its brevity and concision. This is a combination of factors that makes it an ideal teaching tool and well-suited to being a short film for kids. Moreover, Veggie Tales has prepared the way for somewhat cock-eyed religious lessons, Davey and Goliath has us psyched for some stop-action nostalgia, and Wallace & Gromit has demonstrated the potential of Claymation. So I was ready to love this disc. Instead, I only ended up liking it.If you are going to gussie up the core story you really need to adding value, as Bob and Larry and the gang do. The additions here didn't do much for me. However, there is one thing that's very impressive about the film and easily redeems any shortcomings. The art design is based on the href=""http://www.jameschristensen.com/"">work of illustrator of James C. Christensen and it's fanciful and beautiful."
3,4 Children Enjoyed The Video,"I have four girls (ages 3, 5, 6, and 7). We all watched the video together and enjoyed it. The charicatures are ""larger"" than life and so were very appealing to the little ones. It was an unsual mix of cartoon like sensibilities, but with mroe realistic facial expressions. It's all done in computer graphics. It's obviously a play on the idea of ""David and Golliath."" I don't quite understand why they didn't just come out and do the David and Golliath story. As best I can figure, the creaters wanted to create a story for children (and parents) that didn't necessarily want a bible story.Interestingly my oldest picked up and this and asked why it wasn't David and Golliath!"
4,Different and entertaining,"I enjoyed this retelling of the David anf Goliath story. It was fun and quirky. The characters were odd, but interesting. How often do you see a sheep that flies, or people who live on other people. The stop motion was definitely a throw back to the 70's stop motion Christmas stories.Just as a stand alone story I think most kids (aged 3 - 9) would enjoy this DVD. It will keep their attention for the 45 mins. of the show.I would caution parents whose children might get confused with this re-telling of David and Goliath compared to the Biblical story. Be prepared for questions."
4,Cute DVD,"I watched this DVD with my 4 1/2 year old. She seemed to really like it, but not as much as I thought she would. She said she ""just loved it"". It kept her attention and she seemed satisfied with it. There were a couple of times where I explained the story to her, but I think she would have figured it out eventually. We are used to Disney and Pixar animation and the style here was different. The voices chosen were great. Overall, we liked what we saw."
3,"Intriguing look, decent animation, fun retelling of a biblical story","I first saw this on display behind a store window in Park City Utah during the Sundance Film Festival -- the look intrigued me, which is why I decided to pick this up and show my kids. The design is by James Christensen, the fantasy artist, and as with all of his work there is a whimsical and ingenious feel to the characters (little homunculi in some of the characters heads, wings on sheep, etc.). The animation itself is fairly crude, but in a good way -- it resembles all of those old Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. In the end, the style and story felt a bit kitchy to me but my kids were amused, and laughed fairly often. They had fun with this and I guess they are the target audience. I can't see myself ever sitting down to watch it again but I bet they will."
2,Disappointed,"Thought it was going to be a full length movie, but it was just four short stories. And not very interesting stories."
1,Superman/Shazam! The Return of Black Adam,"After seeing the commercials for this movie, I thought it would have been a full length feature film of Superman teaming up with Shazam to take down Black Adam. Or at least giving an in depth look at how Shazam got his powers. Now granted the writers and animators did in fact add all of this information into the movie, but it felt lacking since it was only an 18 minute long scene. I felt cheated since they packed all of that information into a cartoon that could have been done on tv. The entire dvd was a let down since all it truly is is a bunch of 20 minute long cartoons of different characters of the Justice Leauge. I would rather see a full on hour long movie of Superman fighting Black Adam with Shazam then the barely 20 minute scene. NOT WORTH OWNING!"
2,Dissapointing Rip Off of Fan Base,"Like it was said before over and over again, only one new short. You would think that DC & Marvel both would stop taking advantage of their fan base and give people their moneys worth."
2,Misleading Title,"This ""movie"" was actually 4 short animations. Only the first one was about Superman and Shazam. I can honestly say this rental was a waste of time and money. The other animations were about Specter*, the Green Arrow, and Jonah Hex*."
1,****RIP OFF****,"24 minutes! Plus three previously released shorts that if you are considering buying this, then you likely already own them. Extremely deceptive tactic here. I was a faithful subscriber to DC's animated releases, but now I'll wait and see what their peddling before I put down cash."
1,Too Expensive,"This is a 25 Min short, and I am being asked to pay $9.95 for it? I'm sorry but in my opinion, my money is better spent on full length movies."
2,Not worth the price,Didn't realize this was only a collection of shorts. Wouldn't have been half bad if I had not already seen some of the other shorts in other collections I already own. Animation and story on the main title were as expected for a Superman video but I really only want to buy this sort of thing when it contains a feature length movie. Would not recommend on Blu-Ray (because of the price) and certainly not worth $25. Pick it up if you haven't seen any of the shorts before and you can get it for less than $15.I would have liked it much better if it was an hour long feature.
2,Too short and simple for a full DVD,I thought that the art and animation was very good but the story was much too short. This should have been one of a few stories to get it in the 90 minute range.
2,The Blue Ray IS NOT worth $19.99,"I feel that DC is ripping off people who regularly buy these DVDs. The feature short is great by itself, maybe it could've been longer. But to package it with shorts that's already been released is not cool. I have every dvd that DC put out and this is the one that I'm most disappointed with. I have these shorts already and I feel ripped off. Also the portable video player of choice is the ipod/iphone. If you're advertising digital downloads, please warn us ahead of time that you're only making digital downloads for the Zune player only!"
3,Hoping for more,"The thing that annoyed me the most about this is that its only about 25 minutes long. It's not nearly long enough for a proper feature. Then I went back and read the cover where it says that its just a ""short"", which left me VERY annoyed. All those ""bonus cartoons"" were already included on previous releases and I didn't see any bonus scenes that would have made them ""Extended Versions"". Its not worth the $15 in-store price in my opinion."
1,Misleading!,"I was like others very upset to learn this was a collection of shorts which was not stated or made obvious in the description. Even by reading the total time of 63 minutes it doesn't tell you that is is not one full length feature.VERY misleading, VERY disappointing."
4,Exvcelent series,The naysayers need to relax. This is another excellent short in the DC animated line. The superman short runs 22 min. With all the previously released shorts it brings running time to a total of 63 minutes. So your paying 13 dollars on ammazon for anew movie and all the other shorts well worth the money. This isnt like the scam thats been running with Brave and the bold relleasing season one on four seperate dvds and now instead of a full season release they are releasing only 13 episodesin one set.
2,Save you money!,"I am a big fan of both Superman and Captain Marvel. When I say this as an upcoming release, I had to have it! Buyer beware! The Blu-Ray disc says movie time is 63 minutes...paid 19.99 for it. It actually works out to about 15 minutes for the Superman/Captain Marvel story....then 3 other DC characters totalling less than 15 minutes per episode. The stories are not well thought out and when they finish, you're like...that's it? Very disappointed...would have preferred something 60 mins and would have been ok with just the one story rather than trying to fill a disc....one of the 3 other mini-episdoes (The Spectre) had already been released on one of the full-length movies in the past."
1,***Please stay away****,"This DVD was very disappointing, why is it that in the comics to DVD movies Superman is a punk that gets his ass kick more offend than most. His name should be changed in these movies to the Super-hero that can take a punch. Also why does the origin stories change in these DVD's, Superman wasn't Shazam's mentor and to my knowledge didn't know of one of another when Bill gain his powers, and it wasn't in a subway station. I don't know why this story couldn't have been told like this, Black Adam arrives to earth looking to kick-ass and Shazam stands up to him but wait they are equal. Superman arrives and tips the balance of power to Shazam side, and makes a mention about the justice league.Also the short stories of the other Super-hero all suck, as shorts and are in other DVD's. I would rent this DVD if you must see it but wouldn't buy. One Star is too good for this disc."
1,waste of $3.99,"(1) it's 4 short films in one. Superman/Shazam, Spectr, Green Arrow and Jonah Hex. All of which SUCKED. The story lines, characters, and animation all sucked. (2) And TOTALLY not for kids 14 and under. It was graphic and stupid. Basically a bunch of Marvel illustrators/directors had nothing better to do, so decided to make this on a $50 budget."
3,"Amazing film...but way the heck too short, expensive disc.","The art style is absolutely breath taking (best I've ever seen), the audio and voice acting are fantastic, and the action/battle scenes are crazy. I give the film a solid 4 stars; it could have been a perfect 5 stars if it was twice as long (only runs about 20 min) and expanded on the story of Billy Battson and especially Black Adam (i.e. how he travelled across 5 thousand years to get to present time). Other than the disappointing run time, I love this Superman/Shazam film.As for this disc compilation, I don't have the other DC films on blu-ray so i've never watched the other shorts included on all of those discs. However, I do plan on buying them eventually and thus I can see how this compliation can be seen as a very poor effort. I would give this part of disc 2 stars only (just horrible DC/Warner! what a shame).Average, 3/5 stars."
2,"Good Story, Not worth the dollars",This is a group of 4 shot cartoons. One of them had already been released on another disc. I enjoyed the new short Superman/Shazam but was very disappointed that these short cartoons cost so much more than they should have cost. They saw me coming and they got me. Next time I will spend more time reading the box.
1,"I'm a fan, but c'mon!","Full price for a new short?!?!? Come back when you have a feature length movie or a new series. Until then, I'll keep my money."
2,Very misleading product detail,"I gave this 2 stars because giving it a 1 just wouldn't be accurate. The shorts are good - but 3 of the 4 shorts are rehashed and they're not even ""extended"" like the detail says on the back. They are the same 3 short films as seen on the other DC showcases, only the Superman/Shazam short is new. If Amazon had done better to list the details on the back cover onto their site, I would not have bought this. Was it entertaining? Yes. Misleading? Extremely. All in all, its not entirely Amazon's fault. The fault lies in DC and Warner Bros for lying on the back cover."
2,Not Worth Buying or Renting,"This DVD is 4 short stories. The Shazam story is decent, but is way too short. The other stories are very weak. If you want to see it, wait until it is $1.99. It is not worth $3.99."
3,good but too short,"its the same length as a tv episode, 23 minutes. dont know if 12+ bucks is worth it. thought it would be a full feature like the other DC animated films. buyer beware..."
3,Misleading,"This is an assortment of shorts that have been released before with ""Superman / Batman: Apocalypse"" and ""Batman: Under the Red Hood"". The Return of Black Adam is a short in itself so unless you're a collector, better of just renting this one because there is no full length feature here, only two old shorts (Green Arrow & Jonah Hex) and 2 new ones (The Specter & Superman / Shazam: The Return of Black Adam)."
4,Shorts,"This product is a compilation of shorts. If you begin watching with that mindset, I do not see how you could be disappointed. Various animation styles, story telling techniques, and characters get screen time. The Jonah Hex short was my favorite by far, by the Green Arrow, Spectre, and Shazam! shorts were still entertaining. Very enjoyable!"
2,lack luster,"I've been loving the DC Universe movies. There hasnt been one that has come out that I havent liked. What I don't understand is why they felt the need to make this dvd. It would make more sense to have the Superman/Shazam story be a short in the next dvd release. There isnt enough to the story to hold it's own. It just doesnt hold up. By the time you get into it, its over.Rent it or borrow it. Don't buy it."
2,"""Shazam"" and its over.","This was a really,really short animated film, only about a Half hour. WTF? seriously. Not worth what you pay for it. Its literally a 30min fight scene then its over.Pro: Made superman look his best in any animted movie or series he has ever been involved in.Con: rushed product = horrible outcome"
3,Rent it!,"The 23 minutes or so that is the actual Superman/Shazam part is good.Pretty much the rest of the DVD is a collection of other shorts or episodes from other shows that have some relation. If I'd have paid 20 bucks for this, I'd have been disappointed.Check it out from Netflix or Redbox if you have the chance, or wait and see if you can get just the new stuff VOD."
3,i thought i'd love this,"i'm left dissapointed with how rushed the last two DC animated releases feel. only talking about this one....the superman/captain marvel short was pretty good...they should've made it take the entire hour. i actually prefer the batman brave and bold episode featuring the same characters to this one though... the other shorts were so-so. my main complaint is, OUT OF ALL THE STORIES FOUND IN THE DC UNIVERSE...WHY CHOOSE THESE LAME STORIES?my love for DC animated overlooked the other 3-star reviews with the optimistic hope that they were just too analytic, and i would enjoy this....but i really didn't."
1,Lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I only bought this because it said it had expanded editions of the three shorts that were already released on the three other DC Comics DVD's and because I thought the Superman/Shazam story was a full length feature. I was wrong on all accounts. I am not that big a fan of Superman or Shazam but loved the three shorts and thought expanded editions meant longer versions which would have made this disc worth the purchase price even without the main feature. DC has done a great job with these releases till now but it looks like I will have to be much more careful in the future. Fool me once.........
2,"You're buying a short, not a full length feature film.","My kids and I enjoyed the ""Return of Black Adam,"" but it wasn't until it arrived it that we realized it's a ""short.""As you can imagine, it was a little disappointing, given they charged full feature length film price for it. (At $19.99, to boot.)Next time, I'll be sure to look at the length of the main film before I buy."
2,It's Not What They Market It To Be,"Trying to capitalize on the popularity and awesome powers of these three heavy hitters, DC markets this DVD as a Superman/Black Adam/Captain Marvel fest. It's not. Their episode is 20 minutes of cool action, then it ends, making way for a few more vignettes, including one for Jonah Hex.While I enjoyed most of the minisodes, I'm glad I didn't pay for it per se. I saw it on Netflix and alternated between bored and interested after the first show. Don't be fooled."
3,Looks entertaining!,"Looks like this will be another entertaining superhero movie. Finally, one that shows Captain Marvel and Superman in the same movie. Can't wait to see the full movie."
1,Feature-Length Price for 22 minutes? Forget it!,"OK, the DC animated flicks have been overall decent, but this is ridiculous. Nobody should be willing to pay full feature price for a short that's no longer than a single episode of JLU. The other shorts have already been released on other disks so that doesn't count for much.Greed dominates over artistic integrity once again."
1,A waste of time and $,The title is Superman/Shazam but this part of the disc is the shortest part of the disc and incomplete. The Spectre scared my kids and I really didn't care for it. I stopped watching it at this point and wish I had never bought it. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Disregard of history,This is silly. Superman is on Earth-1 (or Earth-2 if it's supposed to be the golden age supes). The Shazam family is on Earth-S.
1,What the heck????,"I haven't seen this DVD yet, and after reading the Amazon reviews, I'm more confused than ever.The Jonah Hex episode has him battling Batman's foe Ras al Ghul - just as he did in the Batman: The Animated Series' episode ""Showdown."" Is this the old BTAS episode or a remake? And if it is a remake - why not do something different?Likewise the Green Arrow episode is described by one reviewer as ""Initiation,"" but that was the first episode of Justice League Unlimited. So does this disc have the JLU episode, or something new?Another review said the Spectre tale has him with Batman and the Phantom Stranger - so is this a new piece, or the ""Batman - The Brave and the Bold"" episode which aired not long ago.In any event, I have no idea what's on this disc beyond the names of the featured characters - and, like most of the recent DC DVDs, I'm losing interest fast.Guess I'll just have to pull out my old discs of Batman, Superman and the Justice League."
2,"Excited about movie, disappointed with preview","Why, why, why? Why do you have to take a cartoon, in which kids will want to see, and then put profanity in it? Even one word? Will it make your movie any cooler to the kids? It just shows how our world today no longer can put out family entertainment that teaches good values and character.You may say, ""Well, it just reflects the real world out there."" Yeah, but I don't want the values, speech and character qualities the world or your video company promotes.The story looks good. The quality of the video is superb to the eye. Yet I can't recommend this nor will I purchase it. A message needs to be sent to these companies that they can make exciting movies without degrading it with unnecessary filth."
3,Not what expected,Shipping and price were great. Product is a little on the cheap side and the case that it comes in doesn't really hold the art supplies well. They keep falling out. Great for a small child but not for a 9 or 10 year old.
2,Disappointing end to an otherwise good machine,"We LOVED the 7130 all-in-one for the two years it worked... but it's dead now ... very disappointing, nearly $600 for only 2 years - bought an HP expecting product longevity and will not buy HP again.Message blinking ""IDS Failure, Call HP,"" led us to lousy HP tech support who informed us that the printheads needed replacing...Repair shop said it would not be cost-effective - we should buy a new printer. BUMMER."
1,HP 7130 Junk do not buy,"I have an HP4P, HP6P, and HP2100- all lasers that have worked beautifully for many years. Then I bought a G85- It has cost more in repairs than all of the lasers put together. Like an idiot, I thought newer HP Multifunctions would be improved. My 7130 has produced 3,800 total copies and has officially been pronounced dead by a high volume printer repair shop. They could not find out why it quit working. Nothing works. They believe it is the motherboard and ... guess what- they said they cannot be purchased. Of course, it is out of warranty. I am never going to purchase another HP printer other than monochrome lasers."
1,"Concept Great, but...","The concept of the 7130 is good, but the execution is awful.First, the performance claims are greatly exaggerated. The actual performance in pages per-minute are about one third or less than the speed claimed. Ink cartridges are only good for about a thousand pages each (not full pages either) the print heads are not much better. This is a very expensive printer to operate. It is also very unreliable. I wish I had not purchased mine.I was warned that the new HP printers were not as reliable as their previous products, but I was a believer in HP products and purchased one anyway--I was wrong. This product is definitely not worth the money. In fact, it is nearly worthless. It is heart breaking to see HP product quality slip to this new low."
2,Does not work well with Dell Dimension running W2K,"HP's ""Director"" software for 7100 series multifunction machines hangs (at process Hposcv07.exe) when scanning to a Dell Dimension running W2K. It prints okay. It all works when connected to a Dell Inspiron laptop also with W2K. There is a stripped-down ""corporate"" driver which both prints and scans, but with other limitations. Learning this required five days of work with three long calls to HP in India. Support personnel seem competent but to no good result. The final result was ""My supervisor says that it is known that the software does not work on Dell computers and we have no solution."" [I tried reporting this to Dell; they would not listen because I bought the HP from you.] I found the limited ""corporate"" driver solution myself; by trying it from HP's download site."
1,"Not a bad machine, but service and support are useless","My 7130 was only 3 months old before the printer carriage refused to move for new ink cartridges. Despite paying for a Next Day Exchange support policy, I still do not have working machine 15 days after the first call. Support is handled in India, and both language and response are a big problem. In, other words, HP support is non-existent and they try to find a lot of reasons not to honor their support contracts. This is complicated machine, and needs good support."
1,"Never been so disappointed in a product, especially surprising considering it's HP.","HP is supposed to be great but I can't believe I got rid of a Deskjet 722c for this pile of garbage. Got it as a gift as an ""upgrade"". Ha! Scanner has NEVER worked (will not communicate with my PC) despite the salesman telling us it would work through a print server networked to two PCs. Goes through ink cartridges like crazy even though we don't print that much, generic-brand cartridges hard to find, document feeder constantly misfeeds multiple sheets at a time and can't be trusted automatically so you have to feed it a page at a time, and print quality is awful. About the only thing that has worked ""just OK"" is the copier (again you have to feed it one page at a time though). Shame on you HP. I want my 722c back!"
1,scanner error issue,"As time goes on, the scanner failure message (requiring powering off then on again) comes on too many times a day to count. When I first bought it (2 1/2 years ago), I never had a problem. Odd. Then, the scanner failure message would only come up after I scanned something. Now, the scanner failure message comes on shortly after it's powered on (even if I haven't used the machine at all). I really can't take incoming faxes, because not matter what the scanner failure message is on and that prevents a fax from coming in (or going into memory). IF I try to power it off quickly, hoping to have it powered back on before the incoming fax is disconnected, then it automatically consideres this a power failure and ends the whole process. In essence, I can only fax out and I have to repower my offiject 10+ times per day. It is a complete nightmare. HP REALLY needs to recall this or send out new software/hardware. It is ridiculous!!!"
1,It guarantees to fail in 2 years!,"This printer completely died on me right before its 2nd birthday.The error message that I get is ""turn off and on"" with flashing (blinking) lights all over the printer. First I thought the power adapter has gone wrong due to power outage that occurred last week. Luckily, my colleague had the same printer so I borrowed her power adapter to test on mine but it wasn't the adapter problem.Roughly 3 months ago, I also had the dreadful ""IDS failure"". After taking out the printheads and putting back in, it solved the problem but the color quality is awful.I bought this unit 2 years ago because it was top of the line officejet printer from pretty reliable HP. I couldn't be wrong any more. That $500 was the worst money that I spent in my entire life.My lessons are1. Never buy inkjet printer2. Never buy an all-in-one unit from HP.I'll try another company next time."
2,hp needs to improve their all in one printers,"You would think I would have learned after having the pricey all-in-one hp d135 and it failed in less than 2 years. I had the d135 serviced and the company who did the work accidentally poked a tiny hole in an important wire and paid for me to replace it so I tried the 7130xi anyway because the other one worked for awhile and I generally liked it. THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED TO THIS ONE - JUST OUT OF WARRANTY OF COURSE. The print cartridges stop moving. I did everything they said to do on their website and nothing! I just can't believe it is the same exact problem.So, a few things HP needs to work on are:1. The carriage jam problem2. The software is slow and hangs up all the time.3. The paper feed on top works only half the time.I recommend you try another brand."
2,best for very light duty copier and fax use,"In 6 months and less than 6,000 copies have had to have unit replaced by HP (with refurbished units) twice. Frequent print head failure which is expensive to replace. Ink very expensive and goes quickly. Officejet is supplied with base level Iris software so it cannot print multiple copies of documents with a table or an embedded image. Can only print one page at a time.Scanning is excellent both in speed and quality. Copy quality is outstanding and speed is very good. For straight color printing cost per page is much lower for color laserjets from HP or Minolta."
1,BROKEN!,"Similar to the complaint by others, my 2 year old (almost to the day) 7130 had an IDS failure, and from reading other reviews, I suspect it cannot be fixed. I will look to other manufacturers for a multi-function machine. By the way, the new HP computer I had went back after it reformatted my XD picture card and rendered it useless. After much effort, HP finally admitted they knew the software was setup to automatically reformat the card and were unable to tell me how to correct that nor were they willing to replace the XD card. No longer a company I am willing to do business with, thank you very much....."
3,Hangs your Computer if using Windows 2000,The printer was great until the upgrades for windows 2000 service pack 4 was installed and then I got the blue screen of death. I since then have talked to a few people who tell me that this is not a problem with XP. HP should put a warning on this printer.
1,All in one MALFUNCTION device.,I want to just echo the same comments as many other users. Scanner failure is a constant problem.
4,Quite adequate.,"I read all these tales of woe and am puzzled. I've had my 7130 for 4 years and the only issue I have had is that if I don't print in color once in a while the heads will be pretty lined. Faxing good, Copying good, scanning good, Paper pickup is flawless and I still can't figure out how it copies 2 sided original to 2 sided copy. Seems magical. I certainly don't doubt your problems mores the pity and I'm not an HP shill."
1,Fax function constantly fails,"Overall, this all-in-one is a disapontment. Besides the overall cheap feel of the machine, the fax function almost never works; errors in sending and recieveing happen at least 80% of the time. To add insult to injury, the machine wastes ink with each failed attempt by printing a sheet stating that there was an error with the fax. Due yourself a favor, don't buy this guy."
1,The FAX from this machine sucks,"This is an ok machine, if you don't need it to send faxes. I bought three of them at the same time since; one machine was for me, the other to my brother and the third one to my dad. Since my brother doesn't use this machine to send faxes, the only thing he complains is that the black copy and printing (taking into consideration the different levels of quality) of this machine is actually slower than the previous machine he had earlier (HP 950c). However, my dad and I are pretty disappointed with the HP 7130. Every time we send a fax, there are error messages and it fails to send it. It takes forever to send a fax that actually reaches the desired location. We probably have operated in the past about 12 different fax machines, and I can tell you without doubts, HP 7130 IS THE WORSE FAX MACHINE I have ever encountered"
5,Great Multifunction,"HP 7130 is a great multifunction device. It was super easy to set up with great instructions. It does everything it is supposed to do with ease. I especially like the print cartrage setup. You don't buy printheads everytime you're out of ink and it lets you know when ink id getting low. This is the first printer I've had since the old Deskjet 710 which is still working, so it's a great step up in speed and quality for me. Great photo prints also. I put off buying a multifunction when the D135 and 145 came out due to poor performance reports. If my machine is any indication, HP relsolved many of the problems they had with previous machines.kcoyner"
5,Comfy but on the larger side,"I really like this sweatshirt. I got it in red to match some shoes and a jacket that I have. The color is very nice and it is very comfortable. Just know that it is sized on the looser side of things, so if you want something more form-fitting consider getting a size down (I got a medium if that's relevant and I wear a medium in basically everything.)"
5,inexpensive and basic,"it is a fleece, that can I say. it is pretty basic, but warm and functional. I say order a size up though."
5,Soffe Men's Zip Front Hoodie Fleece,"I bought three of these and have worn one of them 24/7 along with a fleece cap. Excellent product, YKK zippers!"
3,Light-weight Hooded Sweatshirt,"This is a typical light-weight sweatshirt. It's just like any other basic sweat-shirt you could buy from any major chain store, i.e. Target or WalMart. From the other reviews I was expecting it to be more substantial and the fabric to be softer. I am disappointed. The zipper is very sturdy but the fleece material is not a high-quality fabric."
3,Comfortable,"Comfortable Zip up hoodie, only thing I dont like about this is the hood doesn't feel to comfortable while you are wearing it."
2,Wrong items!!,"I had ordered I LB of Turtles but received various types of chocolate items such as starfish and sea shells, looked back at the Amazon site to see where the order had gone astray but the correct item (Turtles) was displayed.I have no idea why I received the items in its place.????Richard"
3,yummie!,I expected to get more for what I paid for but these cookies were soooooo good I didn't care that much.
2,Same old same old,"I was hoping to learn something about diabetes. It turns out that this is just a half our episode of some medical program. It's all very general, stuff I already knew."
3,Still reviewing item,"Haven't had time to read the book, sorry, but received it in good order.Thank you."
1,TRIFLING,"Somebody just dumped the MARS bars in a brown envelope with one of them being smashed and the envelope was opened,at least they couldve wrapped the candy in plastic. I think that was very tacky and a lousy way to do business!"
1,Expiration Dates,"The product arrived in time, but had an ""expired"" expiration date on it by the time I received it -- not cool."
1,Mars Bars. where are you?????,"I don't really hate it, because I still have not received it. A promised delivery of Dec. 17, 2012has come and gone, and so has Christmas, (an intended gift), I am hoping maybe it getshere by Feb. for a birthday gift......Thanks. PS I ordered it around Halloween...."
4,The 'new' Mars Candy Bar,"My husband and I recently came across the Mars Bars for sale at World Market in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. We bought a number of these Mars Bars which were produced in Poland. We felt they were delicious, but they did not seem exactly like the ones we used to enjoy about 15 years ago."
1,MARS BARS,"I was looking for the old simply delicous Mars Bars ! They had a white nougat interior and a chocolate cover-with nuts.I had hoped that the ones from Ireland would be the same. They weren't.They were too sweet with lots of vile caramel, and I threw them away."
5,Beautifully Romantic,"I admit I haven't heard every recording of these Janacek quartets but of the ones I have heard this is the best, the most beautifully romantic, which is what we want when we consider that Janacek was writing them for the 30-years-younger woman he loved."
2,Warranty problems,"While Amazon lists the warranty as 3 years - very generous - when you go to Lenmar's site they list the warranty as 1 year. Perhaps you can use Amazon's description as a bargaining chip though Lenmar offers no mechanism to do so. But note that Lenmar charges $7.50 to even look at your defective battery plus you pay to ship it to them. If they decide it is out of warranty or not defective, you're out about $10.Consider buying a no-name battery from the auction site for a lot less money."
1,So-Called Theology in Process,"A careful reading of this book compared to your favorite Bible verses about the Personage of God shows how misbegotten is the whole enterprise to refashion deity into a palatable, preferable,processistic being with little resemblance to the Biblical God of Truth. If you're looking for a finite, multi-present, penultimate, quasi-eternal, reductionist deity, you've come to the right place. No matter your position on process or openness or free-will theism, as Clark Pinnock once said, 'theological novelty and a high view of Biblical authority do not fit well together'. 'use of process thought cannot be explained in terms of Biblical reflection, but in terms of the influence of secular modernity.' What God hath been wrought?"
2,More enjoyable than the 2 stars rating would indicate.,"I first read this book when it was originally published, more years ago than I like to admit. I recently found it in a buck a book bin on Cape Cod and thought it just might be worth it. And it was. I'm not sure if the book recreated that time and place in American sports history or if it simply helped bring it back to my memory. Either way, whether you loved him or hated him, it does capture the vintage Namath and a feel for the changes happening in football at that time. Easily worth twice what I paid for it."
5,Another Excellent Book from Burl Barer,"As a fan of Burl Barer but not especially of the True Crime genre it was with some hesitation that I picked up Murder In The Family. I have to say that i was pleasantly suprised by the amount of research and the lack of vouyeristic ugliness I have found in so many of the books of this type. Barer chose to focus on the trial rather than the gruesom details leading up to it, a move much appreciated by this reader. Highly recommended."
3,Scary,"If only the Newmans had changed the locks on the door and kept their windows locked.....This is a sad and disturbing story of a mother and her two little girls who were brutally murdered by a family member! I found all the trial talk a bit boring. I really doubt an interview with the killer himself would add anything, since Kirby Anthoney is nothing but a lunatic liar, and who could believe him? I think it would have been better if the author focused on how Anthoney became the monster that he is. There was a hint that Anthoney had an abusive father but further insight would have been better. Not that it would have excused Kirby of this heinous act, but it would have been interesting to find out alittle more about him. What started out as a book to give you nightmares, wound up putting me to sleep."
3,Murder in the Family,"This is a good book,opens one's eyes as to what horrible actions a psycopath will do. Not finished, but am hoping for a conviction of ""death"""
1,Very dissappointed,"Unfortunately, TOP stole and copied much of the style they were playing from contemporary artists of thier time. The horn sections are weak, and taken directly from James Brown records. Also, the funky vibes are lifted directly from the another prolific force we all know as the Bee Gees. Try Saturday night fever over this one, don't waste your money like I did."
4,Sophisticated Funk,"This was my introduction to T.O.P. and it gradually became a collection of undiscovered classics for me personally. This brand of big & intricate funk really grows on you. If you haven't bought a copy yet, go ahead and ""Knock Yourself Out."""
4,GIVE ME MORE,"This album is great, they just need to give me more. It's missing some great album cuts like ""By Your Side,"" ""Can't Stand To See The Slaughter,"" ""Time Will Tell,"" and many more. If you don't have any TOP than this is a great start, if you're like me and have most of their albums than it's probably best to buy the albums that we're missing."
1,Did not like this book,I am in the medical billing field and have been for many years. I found this book fragmented. Not a good resource at all. I recommend the books from Fordney or Rowell.
1,Buying this book is a mistake...,"I made the sad mistake of buying this book. Most of chapters in the book describe principles that would apply to ANY business (and do a poor job at that). For example, Chapter 2 - obtaining financial help, Chapter 3 - The Business Plan, Chapter 5 - writin a business plan, Chapter 6 - Getting started and networking, on and on. These chapters have no information (or very very little) relating to the medical field. In chapter 21, she finally says ""Let's Get Technical"". But she is still very shallow on medical billing details. Unless you know nothing about the medical field, this book will be little, if any, value to you."
1,Not for me,I would not recommend this book. Too many mathmatical errors and not enough information. Little to folksy for the image that a professional would want to present. I recommend Understanding Health Insurance by Rowell.
5,He's done it ................................. AGAIN,"Dear amr diab fans,he has done it again, and this time he's done it in big style. This album is just another amr diab classic. God Bless him, no other egyptian or middle east artist release albums with such beautiful diversity ... Latin,Spanish,RnB,Jazz,Tango and of course pure arabic tunes, all in one piece and they are all beautiful. tracks like tedar tetkallem, ana ayesh, alli elwadaa', and many others will surely blow ur mind, and the biggest surprise on the album, Khallini Gambak - this album has been on HEAVY ROTATION since its release and Im just waiting for da next one. Amr - god bless you, dans BUY IT .............."
2,Less than stellar.,"Not bad, but also not worth the price. The pictures and tricks have some good points; however, it lacks any real stand-out piece and is very short."
3,cute but iffy on the practicality,"i bought this for my Spanish classroom thinking that mnemonic devices are helpful and fun for my students but the book includes some tricks that are great while others are too much of a stretch to be helpful. in retrospect, an entire book of mnemonic devices didn't really meet the needs of my Spanish 1 students. my favorite feature is the model sentences (where students fill in the blanks) and the charts that display the verb conjugated in both the present tense and preterit tense."
4,"Cute book, good for beginner students","I purchased this book to help me teach verbs to a Spanish I class. So far, they do recall many of the mnemonic phrases especially the rhyming ones (e.g. Boone leaves the saloon), although the book does not contain as many verbs as I would like, and does nothing to help remember stem-changing verbs (besides listing the conjugations below the cartoon).Even so, it's a good study aid and we have been using it whenever new verbs come up that are included in this book."
5,Better than original,This battery is double the capacity of the original and I got it shipped in one day at a fraction of the cost of an OEM battery. Works great.
4,Nikon Charger for the EN-EL9,"This is the standard charger that Nikon sells for use with the D40's EN-EL9 battery. The title incorrectly shows it is for charging the EN-EL5. That battery will NOT work with this charger -- the contacts won't line up.If you do need it for the EN-EL9, it works very well. I'd appreciate a shorter power cord for travel use, but it is detachable so you can switch it out."
3,"Hate to nitpick, but . . .","Product works as advertised, but I don't understand why they designed it to need a separate power cord. Canon got it right, their NiMH chargers have flip-out prongs that plug directly into the wall, no additional cord required. A cord is just one more thing to haul around and lose."
5,Works as expected,"There is not much to say about this product. It is the standard battery charger that came with my Nikon D40. It works perfectly, comes with a power cable and was a decent price."
3,Not really a 'quick' charger.,"As promised by Amazon, this charger arrived on time. I'd lost my original charger and needed to charge my battery and a spare for my Nikon. The charger arrived in an envelope, with no packaging or instructions. In addition, it took almost 14 hours to charge one battery. My original charger took a couple of hours, but not this long! I thought maybe it was the battery, but the second one took just as long. Can't imagine taking this on a trip if it takes this long to charge one battery. It also got incredibly hot while it was charging. I'm considering sending it back, but no one around here carries this charger in-store and I'm not sure a replacement would be better."
3,Great customer service.,"I received the product very quickly. But wouldn't you know it, it was damaged. I was very upset because i needed it in time for Christmas. I sent and email and I received a very quick response and i received the new product on Christmas eve. Just in time! I only rate it 3 stars because i was under the impression that this was an exact replica of the original that came with the camera only to find out that it was very, very, very cheaply made. It felt like it was going to break just holding it. But like i said, great customer support. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"performs it's duty, but a nusiance otherwise.","Charges the battery as it should, since that is what it is designed to do. But...And it's a pretty big ""but"", the form factor is awful. Two long cords which make it completely useless for travel and it is difficult to store away neatly. Like someone else mentioned the design should have been similar to Canons where it has flip out prongs for plug in, not a 2 foot long cord on each side. Keep that in mind when viewing the picture here, it doesn't show the cords.Nikon makes a great camera, but this accessory was not well thought out at all."
1,Piece of Junk,I got this supposedly 'Nikon' quick charger and it must be counterfeit because I can't imagine Nikon putting their brand on a piece of junk as flimsy and defective as this. It literally broke on first use - the contacts fell off into the charger. It's useless. I want my money back.
1,Test it right away!,Some vendors are selling products that don't actually work and will insist that it is your batteries! I tried two different sets of batteries and had to return one charger. A different vendor's charger worked just fine. The light should come on when the battery is inserted. Buyer beware!
5,Meets all Expectations,"This charger is smaller than the one that originally came with my D40, which I lost. I've only used it for one charge so far, but it seems to take about the same amount of time to charge the battery and the charge is holding quite well."
2,this was not Nikon this was either gray market or a replica.,But I will give two stars instead of one since they did mail me somethign that might have worked but I returned it and bought a real one.
1,Discription WRONG!!!!!!,This charger is for the EN-EL9a battery NOT for the EN-EL9 battery. They are different sizes for different cameras and NOT interchangeable.
4,we were confused...,"we had our battery charger stolen from us from out of our suitcase in south africa.of course we turned to amazon.com looking for a replacement, which we found. BUT the photograph is very deceptive. (we found) Not seeing in the picture or the discription of the item, the power cord, we purchased one seperately. we were thrilled of course when the battery charger arrived but were somewhat surprised to see the power cord with it. well....now we have 2 power cords and that is better than non.maybe the power cord should be added somewhere."
2,Not the specials collection I wanted,It's a bit annoying that the songs of my college days aren't in here.I should have been more careful
4,"Best belt, sold by best online retailer!!","Good luck finding this in stock anywhere. Amazon has the best price by far!These belts run quiet, stop squeeling/chirping that cheaper belts do."
5,Works great!,"Bought to replace my second failed (squealing) belt from Advance Auto Parts (Dayco brand). The Gatorback belt works perfectly and never squeals. Plus, Amazon sells this for half the price of Advance's junk!"
2,Polemics Get in the Way,"Jaki's book has a thesis well summarized by the first reviewer. The polemic to support this thesis gets in the way for this reader. Newman is not an easy companion for either pro-curialists like Jaki on the one hand or the liberal sorts who try to claim Newman. Jaki sees Newman totally on his side and to do that you have to ignore Newman's own problems with Rome and the English and Irish hierarchies. If Newman was as ultramontane (super Roman) as Jaki says, why did the conservative hierarchy at the time distrust him so?"
4,Great Speakers for the price,These speakers are great for the price Ive been looking for speakers and these are the one for me and surely you too.
1,Another non-delivery,I see that this merchant reneged on shipping. They failed to ship my order. Doesn't even deserve one star.
1,Unreliable,"I bought the 1500 watt generator at Fleet Farm for around $200. It was a struggle to get it started the from the day I purchased it. Out of the 6 times I have tried to use it I was able to start it 3 times. Many pulls, replacing the spark plug, checking the gap, etc. Never know if it is going to work and of course the frustrating part is you typically have plans when you use the generator and it can ruin your whole evening as you sit in the dark wishing you bought a better generator.I would not recommend this generator."
1,worthless,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this. I had mine run for about 30 minutes. Then it just bogged down. Wouldn't start again till morning. Ran 5 minutes and stalled. Tried to restart the pull cord housing exploded. Tried to Jerry rig it, no longer possible to function. Worst money I have ever spent."
2,LIMMITED TO USE,"I got this for camping,when new it powered my a/c,microwave, tv, everything, but within a very short time it would not power the a/c or microwave (700 watts) it is very noisy, i liked the portability-weight-size, but its power capability is just to small,it is to obtrusive (noise wise) for any type of camping,and is better suited to operate at a work site where you only need a small drill or grinder ,it is not enough to operate a worm drive skill saw,i have tested the output and it is only 9amps.@ 115volts. i wished i would have put the cost of this unit towards one of the more expensive sine wave inverter generators to start with. i now have a kipor ig 3000 watt and it is an excellant unit well worth the money, because i can actualy use it with great satisfaction,instead of store it with great dissipointment."
2,@000 Watt Gasoline Generator,I have found numerous bolts loose all over the generator. On the gas cap there was a large printed piece of tape saying to use 10-30 oil. If someone didn't know where to put gas and oil they could dump the oil in the gas tank. Then there is the instruction booklet which says to use SA or SE oil leaving out the 10-30 weight which is confusing. I now have to check under the engine as I have an oil leak. It could be a loose bolt. I hope so.
3,New Gas Generator,"look i just got it a week agao,filled it up full of gas and ran it for 30minutes,i assumed all new generators would be quit but i was wrong its not at all,but i was just testing it for my upcoming trip,and today i got a call from home the gas from this generator is all over the floor in our garage,im not sure if its defected of what,i was looking at it real close,and theres a maybe i didnt turn the switch off that controlls the gas,so i filled it back up with gas but i turned off the switch,now i gotta monitor it to be sure that was the problem,i read someones else's review they said that was there problem,if thats it great,so how do i quit this darn thing down,or do i gotta buy a better mufler?or move it far far away from my camp"
2,Part lost in shipping!!,Haven't put generator into service yet since the manufacturer wouldn't honor the fact that the bolt holding one corner of the gas tank vibrated off in shipping; contacted the factory for the rubber shock absorber that was missing to no avail. Not much consideration for a simple simple rubber washer that could have been sent in an evelope.
2,Buy a cheap generator and you get a cheap generator...,"Bought it in 2008 after the ice storm, and opened the box a couple months ago during the hurricane... Worked great during the hurricane outage, but dies in the recent snowstorm outage. Customer support did not return calls, but if you call (636) 532-9888 you can ask to hold for the next rep. and the replacement part was $28 after shipping.I broke down and purchased a real generator from B&S; and am glad for the purchase, and got schooled by the repair staff about 'catalog generators'... The truth is, you should purchase a bigger, name brand generator such as B&S; or Toro since most local repair shops can get parts for them.Basically, I bought the cheapest 4-stroke generator I could find, and I got a cheap generator which I will use only as a loaner, never for myself."
1,Made Very Poorly,"I needed a Generator befor going hunting, so I decided to go with this one. The first one I revieved would not run so I disposed of it and they sent me a new one free of charge. When I recieved the new one, it had two broken motor mounts fresh out of the box which I noticed on the first one as I was disposing it. I leave in two days to go hunting and still dont have a generator. Dont buy gas powered equipment from amazon you can not return it if it does not work."
2,Terrible starting,"So I was hopeful for this thing, but it has proven very difficult to start. Poor directions. After about 50 pulls the first time it finally started. Then it ran just fine, lasted a good 5-6 hours running a tv and dvd player. However, once it ran out of gas it took about 20-30 pulls again to start. I thought it might be just that it was empty and needed to be primed, but there's no primer. So after it ran for another 2 hours I turned it off to try and restart it. Same problem, 20-30 pulls later it started again. My shoulder was terribly sore after the weekend and since I was ice fishing in 0 degree weather, it was awefully inconvenient."
1,sorry i ever purchsed this item.,"this generator does not even have enough 12volt power to charge a radio control battery,and you have to raise the rpm's so high that you can't here over the noise.i am very unhappy!"
4,Good for the most part,"I'm a big Coldplay fan and was excited when I got this book. I quickly sat down and learned ""The Scientist,"" one of my favorite tracks from the album. The book was very helpful in picking apart not only the melody and guitar chords, but also Chris Martin's piano parts.However, whenever I've seen clips of Coldplay playing ""The Scientist,"" there seems to be a different left hand part played than what is actually written in the book. Oh well, just a little work to do. Good Stuff though."
5,AWSHUM,"I love this book, it is Awesome.really accurate and even the songs with primarily guitar sound good on the piano, except daylight doesn't sound quite as good without guitar. The songs are pretty repetitive and easy to memorize, so you can play them without the book, which is great because, girls love coldplay, and if they don't then they arent really the kind of girls you want to be with anyway. so now i can play clocks, the scientist, in my place, god put a smile upon your face, and politik without a book.There are some tricky key signatures though, so i wouldnt recomend it to beginners, but if you can play, go for it"
4,A Pleasure to Play,"I look forward to going home every night (and probably much to my neighbors' and roommate's dismay) to try to play and sing at the same time. The music is for the piano to accompany the rest of the band, so it doesn't always carry the melody. But it's awesome and not too bad. The abundance of sharps and flats may scare some, such as me, but in the end the chords are not too difficult; there is a lot of repetition. I am particularly fond of many of the songs. I hope this helps! Personally, I prefer Parachutes."
5,~Excellent~,This book is awesome! I love Coldplay and I love the piano parts in their songs. The first song I learned was Amsterdam and it was very easy to read and to learn. And I recently started playing the songs on my guitar and it's very fun! I love this book!
2,Not what I expected,"There's no guitar tablature. What a disappointment. If you play piano, you'll be satisfied, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Nice-one Bill,"An uneven album of B-sides and rarities, nevertheless essential for a few golden nuggets which all Bragg fans should have in their play-list. The relatively obscure - and much too short - Scholarship is the Enemy of Romance, is the pick for me. Here we find Barking's most famous Saturday Boy at his love-sick best. A cover of a Smith's lesser-known track, the kitchen-sink classic, Jeane, is also memorable. Also included is one of Bragg's best political songs, Days Like These, which has the same lump-in-the-throat poignancy as his more familiar Between the Wars."
4,A Great Intro to Billy,"I must confess to not knowing Billy till Mermaid ave.(which i love along with mermaid 2)But after purchasing this cd i definately plan on buying more from him.Unlike other reviewers, I am not afraid to have my beliefs challenged-especially by such a fresh and courageous perspective-that is to say I come away from his political songs invigorated, refreshed and sometimes with a new perspective--and I think that is exactly what Billy wants to accomplish."
4,Good for a sample of Billy Bragg's varying styles,"Billy Bragg is not only a political activist, but the guy can sing a good ballad too.There is a sampling of both here; from the beautiful heart-wrenching cover ""A Heart is a Wheel"" to the politically infused ""Days Like These"" to the purely pop hit ""Shirley"" this CD has it all.A fine introductory collection of Bragg's differing musical stylings."
3,Interesting,"This is a book that I had to read for a project for one of my classes. It's the story of one woman's spiritual journey. While I probably would not have purchased this book otherwise, it actually was pretty interesting. I learned quite a few things about Native American traditions."
5,Excellent blade,"We have used many different blades for our HVAC rough-in work - these are by far the most durable and long-lasting that we have used. They cut very quickly, and are priced far below most other ""inferior"" blades. When other contractors ""borrow"" a blade from us, they almost always order some for themselves. A great product!"
4,Battery,Purchased the Vf707 and did not want to charge this is the only reason i am giving it a 4. I notified the company and they worked with me great. They replaced the Battery without a hassle. I am very pleased with the customere service and the replacement works great. I would buy from them again.
5,Nice long lasting battery!,I am very happy with this battery. It has lasted a long time and has not let us down when recording special family events!
5,Wonderful,"I find it amusing that two reviewers gave this CD one star. They must have forgotten that birds are major inhabitors of deciduous and coniferous forests throughout North America! If you do not hear birds, then where are you? I suspect that the other reviewers wanted to hear other sounds, such as thunder, rain and wind. But, having lived in a deciduous forest for my entire life, the birds are the only wondrous friends that I need! All the other sounds that you hear in the forest come after them! The CD is very peaceful and calming, and I listen to it before going to sleep at night (along with other CDs). It is a blessing to have nothing but nature sounds surrounding you, and it is much better than a lot of human-produced nonsense that we hear nowadays on the radio!"
1,"I agree with ""Nothing except birds!""","I agree with the other one-star reviewer -- nothing but bird sounds, and with my computer sound all the way up, even my kitten wasn't impressed -- mostly because they're very hard to hear! Big disappointment."
1,Haven't gotten it yet,Would love to review this book but my order placed in November 2001 has not yet been filled. Yet the book has been available in book and record stores for over a month. Past editions have been excellent and I would hope that when my copy finally arrives it will be also.
3,Big Gets Bigger,"The best classical music guide available especially when combined with its budget companion. There is a ""BUT"" however, as it is impossible to search for specific artists or conductors without going through the titles of the works. A data base on CD ROM would be great and an index would be helpful. The book is also getting a bit thick, making bedtime reading difficult."
2,Slipping fast,"In the past this guide has been criticized for its' peculiar British bias. I have little quarrel with that, however, I do question a guide that has no listings whatsoever for Slvius weiss, Pachebel, The Great Regondi (ya, I know he is really obscure...but very worthwile!) or several other well known composers. I think these ommissions are unforgiveable. They used to be in earlier editions, so I think they are losing ground and this edition is less usefull than earlier editions. It is still, alas, indespensable."
4,"Very good, but...","I found this book the best guide to classical recordings available, but... 1/the liric music reviews are very disappointing: the parameter used for rating the symphonic music can't be used for operatic music, as they do. The result is that very lively performances by the musical point of view are overrated despite the cast or the interpretation is fully unsatisphing.(i.e. the Solti's interpretation of ""La Traviata"" and ""Rigoletto"") 2/the reviews are ""british based"", it seems that only in UK is possible to find good orchestras or conductor. 3/when a label stops pubblishing a records it desappear from the guide. Many poeple who could be interested in used records or magazine's reissues of the performance can't be satisfied by this approach."
5,"Accurate, Reliable and Readable","Of all the guides to any subject, this may be the most bankable I have come across. The ""Rosettes"" really are special recordings, and the narrative descriptions are uncannily dead- on. However, it is a big book, and one can waste a lot of time hunting down a particular recording if turns out not to be classified where you guessed it should/would be. (Sometimes, I know a recording is there because I came across it once, but still I can't find it again.) If ever there were a candidate for a searchable CD-ROM rom text, this is it. Still, if you buy a lot of CDs, this is indispensable."
5,The Indispensable Guide to Classical Music CDs,"I've been using the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs under its various names for as long as it has been published. Together with Gramophon Magazine's Good CD Guide, it is one of the indispensable tools to use in winnowing through the mountains of recordings issued for popular compositions, such as the Vivaldi Four Seasons, and for discovering compositions, composers and performers you might not have considered previously.The Guide does not pretend to be a Schwann's guide to all CDs in print. Rather, it is a selection from what is available, and it is wonderfully helpful. The taste and erudition of the reviewers is almost always on target, always allowing for differing tastes in music and performance.This new edition is better than previous ones because it includes even more recordings, and because it does so in a larger format.This is definitely a must-have."
4,Penguin recommendations vs actual CD availability,"Vastly erudite & discerning reviews. Main fault: where can one find ANY of the CDs listed? Classical music marketing in the US is a shambles. Since most - or many - of the reviews are European biased, this means that the problem of availability for US buyers is worsened: just try to find anything reviewed at your local - or mail-order - store. That said, the Guide is valuable for the mere knowledge of who recorded what, and for the entertainment value of the witty writing."
3,Big Gets Bigger,"The best classical music guide available especially when combined with its budget companion. There is a ""BUT"" however, as it is impossible to search for specific artists or composers without going through the titles of the works. A data base on CD ROM would be great and an index would be helpful. The book is also getting a bit thick, making bedtime reading difficult."
1,Not what was advertised,"2 main problems with this battery.First, it isn't a Lenmar battery as advertised. It's just a generic battery in a generic box. I trust Lenmar to be good qualtiy, as I've bought Lenmar batteries in the past.Second, while it seemed to work the first day I tried it, a few days later there was no power left in the battery, and over subsequent weeks, I haven't ever been able to recharge the battery at all. Meaning not even enough to get the video tape out of the camera. I have to plug the camera in if I want to do anything at all with it.Don't waste your time on this one."
4,A Book Review of Mystery on October Road,"The book Mystery on October Road is about a girl named Casey, whose next door neighbor is very creepy! He has two huge animals wandering around his house and he wears some kind of mask. Casey and her friends decide to investigate.I really liked when Casey and her friends looked in the next door neighbor's house and saw a big furry thing they thought was the next door neighbor. Was it? If you want to find out then you should read this book!"
5,A wonderful story.,I read this book for a book report and I loved it. It was such a sweet story. It's about a dog named Mcgrowl who rescues a cat and becomes famous and then he tries to find his real owner. If you don't wanna know the ending then DON'T read this: In the end Mcgrowl finds his real owner and she lets Thomas (Mcgrowls new owner) keep him. This is a truly amazing book!!
2,Too small for it to fit utensils,"I bought it for my kitchen. I could only fit my serving spoon, spatula, and two other utensils. Already it felt crammed. Don't get this for kitchen utensils. Get something else."
4,Earthy,"I love Bambu products! These utensil holders have a beautiful, natural, earthy look to them. They are a little small so I bought 2 and I'm considering buying a 3rd. I actually like the look of them lined up on my counter. Just a heads up, if you get more than one keep in mind that they are made from actual bamboo shoots and therefor the color and size varies a bit from holder to holder. I personally don't mind because it adds to the natural look."
3,Small.,"Much smaller than anticipated. It might be that we have 15 utensils, but we cook quite often. I have them stuffing out of it, they are cramped..."
3,Overview for Newcomers,"Concise review of US american history from the 'Discovery' of the New World to 'Today' (whatever that means. My 1978 fourth edition ends with Carter, later editions are extended). The tone is factual and quite unbiased and the book but provides for sufficient linkages and explanation to understand the major movements and dynamic within US history. I pull it out of the shelf when I want to get a quick reminder of certain events in US history (say: background on Monroe doctrine, or Louisiana purchase) and am mostly satisfied with information provided.This was my first 'American History' book when I came to the US in 1982.I like it much better than other 'popular' books like 'US History for Dummies' which tries to be funny (and that means you have to read 2 times as much in order to obtain same information as current book.Disadvantage of this book: very limited number of maps and other visual aids."
3,I wanted one song I couldn't find elsewhere,"I love cheesy movies like this one, and I loved that song ""Ain't no stoppin' sunshine"" which I could never find available anywhere other than on this soundtrack. Worth it just to obtain that song, but there are some other quality songs on here too!"
4,Jazz tune too!,The movie and songs are great. I also would like to know the name of the jazz tune being played as Eva and LL are dancing at the Governor's Ball. And the name of the group.
5,Love it!,The song where they're singing in the meat truck is Mary J. Blige- Sweet Thang. Hope that helps. Loved the movie! :)
5,This movie and soundtrack was absolutely wonderful!!!,"I admit I originally watched the movie for LL Cool J, but the acting and the soundtrack was wonderful.I have watched the movie three times and I always play the soundtrack immediately after. I would highly recommend it!!!"
4,Music that enhanced the movie,The best song on the cd was K-Ci and Jojo singing this very moment. That song is absolutely beautiful. Calvin Richardson also had a nice song. The sound track would've been a lot better if the jazz songs from the dance scenes were included. Overall the music was a great enhancement to the movie.
4,Just a little disappointed!,"I must say that I truly enjoyed this soundtrack. But I was a little disappointed to get the CD home and find out that ""This Very Moment"" by K-Ci & Jo-Jo was not featured on the soundtrack. For those of you who have seen the movie, you know the song I am talking about. It is incredible. But as far as the CD is concerned, I would recommend it to anyone. If you have not seen the movie, PLEASE GO SEE IT!! IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!"
3,Over Rated & Over Priced,"From a historical perspective, this is a good compilation but, from a listening perspective, not that great. Go with ""Industrial Madness"" or ""Industrial Revolution"" 2nd & 3rd edition. Trust me, you will play this, then it will get pushed to the back of your collection. It's also hard to get this at a decent price where as the ""Industrial Revolution"" discs can be had at bargain prices."
3,Very Wide,Great except for the flash gets blocked with the dsc-h7. Better used with the h9 and external flash.
4,I love this lense,"I have the Sony DSC-H9 and trust me It surely does add more width to your photo when taking pictures in a tight spot or when you need to get more out of your photo. The only I problem I had with it is when you want to zoom in the focus gets blurred, as well as the ""auto burst"" function is disabled when using the lense. But overall, whenever I go ""out"" to take pictures, I make sure I never leave home with out it :-)"

2,romanticizing a war of independence,"Ms Ephron's book misses the historical implications of the protagonist's actions. Why did the US/Hearst get involved? I suggest Eduardo Galleano; ""Open Veins of Latin America."" What would cause a young woman to willingly give up ""love"" from 2 different men; perhaps an intense desire for independence or her quest for freedom? These were never developed. The Karl/Charles character was also flat. Was he after a story or working for the US interests? The book seem too simplistic and more of a short story needed further development."
4,4 1/2 stars more accurately,"I too am a Cuban-American and I loved this book! I couldn't put it down once I got started. After reading this book I felt compelled to do more research on Evangelina to see if the story was indeed based on history, & it is!This book is beautifully written. I could feel the warmth of the island and envision the tropical landscape. I felt I was there. I don't know what book that other Cuban-American was reading, but it couldn't have been this one. This book was NOT boring!I would have given it five stars but I didn't like the way this story ended. I didn't feel this was a romance story and liked the way the author had written the majority of the book not as one. But on the very last couple of pages, she changed the tone of the relationship of the two main characters and it didn't feel necessary or right."
1,"This is not a book, but a bad short story.","Talk about a left-over screenplay... I've read hundreds of better screenplays than this novella (posing as a novel). How long did it take the author to write this? One week? Two days? It feels like the typical New Yorker book - everything is laid out just right; nice and short, fancy cover design, airport sales, mass market....yet there's nothing to this story or this book. There's no motiff, no compelling characters, no engaging theme...There are a million talented suffering writers and the publishers spit in our faces with this drivel. What next? A novel condensed in three pages? Give me a break - will not be buying from Ballentine for a long time."
3,Jarman power,"With this movie Derek Jarman puts his stamp firmly on the ""pro-gay"" films of the early 1990's when aids was playing havoc n the gay community. Well acted and worth seeing, but not exceptional."
1,WARNING - GAY VERSION OF EDWARD II,"I needed to watch this movie for class, but I was careless to look at the date of the movie. I knew something seemed wrong when the movie started and there were two naked men having soft core sex on a bed, followed by the next scene when two different men started kissing and then I had to shut it off. This is definitely NOT the movie I was looking for."
2,"A lot of details, few insights","This book has been originally writtem 20 years ago and today is reproposed in a new package. Being brief the problems with this book are essentially two:1) the author has a tendency to get lost in details many of them insignificants for the story, and some of them plain wrong (and the author could have corrected them).2) the book is in the stream of war histories watched only by one side. It is interesting to note that the author never mentions the unusefulness of the battle of El Alamein: it is in fact well known that the Torch landings will have forced the Axis army to withdrawn anyway and therefore the British could have attacked the Axis much more easily. But this it would not have been a British-only victory, but an Anglo-American victory.Therefore it seems a little pretentious to call this book the ""definitive"" history of the western desert war. Given the boredom caused by the plethora of details, it is more likely the ""bed-time"" history of desert war."
5,Strawberry Blonde,"If you like old classic movies, this one is a peach. I was happy to find this product through Amazon as it was hard to find anywhere else. Highly recommend to others."
5,140 minutes in the chords of love,Innovators of sound manipulation. They who paved the way for artists like myself searching for an elixir to music. Cosey's voice never overpowering the music but blending in like favored eddys as Chris takes you on a journey of synaesthesia. May they be around forever tantilizing the audience with the darker side of pleasure.
5,Verbs galore,"There are a ton of words in this CD-ROM. Even verbs like ""kvetch""! I liked the organized fashion in which the verbs are presented; basically, a couple clicks can give you most any verb, the person and tense of it. So much better than all those thick verb books which take your hours to sort through."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for something that I could easily give my students to listen to while driving, though this was not it."

5,Among the top Manon Lescaut recordings,This recording is among the best recordings of Manon Lescaut.I can't rate it high enough.Tebaldi & Delmonico sing their hearts out and are in top vocal form.You can get this in the new Decca Puccini set which includes several Tebaldi/Delmonico/Puccini discs.I would not hesitate.
1,Too big and too much shoe!!,I already have big feet and these shoes did me no justice. I really wear a 15 and these still were way too big. This was the second time I had to return a pair of Florsheim. I hate eating the shipping charges but Amazon gives you no choice.
4,ELVIN BISHOP GROUP,"""ELVIN BISHOP GROUP"" IS NOT THEIR BEST WORK BY FAR, BUT BEING A DIE HARD BISHOP FAN I HAD TO HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION... BISHOP'S MUSIC WAS A DEFINING MEMORY OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES FOR ME... DAD GUM YA HIDE BOY AND TULSA SHUFFLE ARE GOOD DRINKING TUNES AND THE INSIDE JACKET COVER PHOTO OF BISHOP STAGGERING AROUND WAVIMG A LIQUOR JUG AND A .45 REVOLVER TELL THE STORY WELL"
3,Takes me back to the late 60's again!,"Elvin Bishop played when we kids were roaming all over the San Francisco Bay Area catching Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Country Joe and the Fish, Cream, ELO, Santana, Joe Cocker, Canned Heat, the Kinks, and on and on and on. My son asked me once, ""Mom, is that all you guys did back then? Go to concerts?"" Visions of open-airs in Golden Gate Park and on Stanford grounds, at Winterland and the Fillmore West in San Francisco, the Longbranch Saloon in Berkeley, the Catalyst in Santa Cruz, and so on filled my head before I answered, ""Pretty much so, Honey"". Do treat yourself if you like this recording to a much better and bluesier one by Taj Mahal called The Natch'l Blues. Very smooth and rhythmic."
3,For Toscanini collectors only,It's a real pitty that the sound engineers could not make a better job with this 2 cd set (why not select recordings with a better sound?). I would love to hear Dvorak's Symphonic Variations and Brahms' 4th Symphony with a good (= decent) sound. Maybe another time. Recommended only for Toscanini collectors.
1,My Cats Will Not Eat the New Formula,"I chose to switch my cats to Felidae after the food they'd been eating for five years was discontinued and I had trouble finding something they liked that was safe for them to eat. Felidae seems to be one of the only brands not involved in the constant pet food recalls. I did start them on the non-senior variety and then moved to this when it was time to more closely watch their weight. They are healthy and shiny with fewer hairballs than they had in the past. UPDATE (June 13, 2012): I just got a new bag of this food. The formula seems to have changed (indicated by a new food shape), and my cats will no longer eat it."
2,Pretty,This item is like the light I bought for the dining room. It looks nice but the screws do not tighen the pieces the way they should; therefore the parts you have to assemble onto the light move around.
5,The Perfect Deordorant,"I have been using Speed Stick Fresh for as long as I can remember, and I never tired of the smell. It is pleasant, manly, and loved by my wife. It is not too fruity or perfume-y, yet fragrant enough to smell very good in a crowd. Speed Stick Fresh is number one on my odor fighting list."
5,P.O.D. RAWKS!!!!!!!!,"this album is one of the best rap core albums ive ever heard. move over Korn and Rage Against the Machine. this band really kicks, and brings a positive message about Truth in their songs. this is a must buy for any rap/metal fans out there. lata. Kurt"
4,addictive beats,this cd is very addictive i mean my brother went to school and couldn't get the southtown tune out of his head and when he came home he listened to it. me i enjoyed this cd it has addictive beats and lyrics i was surprised that the whole band was christian but then i was like who cares they made on great cd if u like rap and hard rock put together u will enjoy this cd.
5,This is nuts,"If you like Rage Against The Machine and/or Sevendust, this is the perfect CD for you. I just got this CD today and I already love the whole thing."
5,This CD is the best ever,Most cd's only have a few good songs and the rest stink but not this cd the good hits just keep on rolling. I't the best cd I own P.O.D is the best BUY THIS CD or you will regreat it!!!
5,"Money, Money, and Money","This is the raddest album that I have bought in I can't remember how long. Wuvy is dope on the drums, Marcos plays the guit like no tomorrow, Traa is just MONEY on the bass, and Sonny... Well, what can I say... Sonny is just flat out good. This album is just great. Tracks such as ""Outkast"", ""Tribal"" and especially ""Southtown"" are so well crafted, it is scary. The songs are tight, and the band has grown since Snuff the Punk came out all those years ago. In short, get this album now."
5,Rapcore takin' over the world,"Rapcore is takin' over the world and P.O.D. is the best rapcore group yet! They are like a combination of rage against the machine, korn, limp bizkit and hip-hop, only with Christian lyrics! It's awesome! If you're a Christian or a fan of hardcore or rapcore music - GET THIS CD! You're going to love it!"
4,P.O.D. is ready to be the next big phenomenon.,"This album is the best one to just get in your car and ride...with nowhere to go. The people behind this album got the best they could out of P.O.D. and did one heck of a job, because this album is (excuse the slang) tight from beginning to end. Southtown is the best song on the album, rocking and groove-oriented at the same time. Everyone compares them to Limp Bizkit, but that's not exactly accurate. They're more straight-forward than LB, more soulful, while not quite as hard-rocking. Still, all in all, an extremely good album, if not great."
3,...Payable...,"...POD or Payable On Death has been around for a while and there latest release 'The Fundamental Elements of Southtown' has left me with mixed feeling.POD is more rap than core. They have some pretty phat guitar riffs on some of the tracks but the way they chose to mix in the vocals is some what disappointing at times.The middle of the album is definitely Southtown's strong point, which starts off weak with Hollywood but gets better at the self-entitled song #3, has a niice little climax, and finishes pretty well.However, the overall album is not that impressive and does not really have the power to get you going like some hardcore bands, which is primarily why i sold this album about 2 weeks after buying it. Not recommended because there is a lot of better stuff out there..."
5,Can you head bang in church?,"If so you would love these guys. I popped in the cd, moshed, broke a few household items (accidentally) and then prayed. Not a typical day, but then again, these guys aren't the typical band. If you love hardcore/rap/metal then you would love these guys. There is a bonus also, positive lyrics."
1,Pretty weak stuff,"I thought I would give these guys a chance, and I did. The result for me was just a lame mess. I realize that a lot of bands are entering the genre, and these guys are'nt really new, but they have three things going against them. First, they have no musical talent whatsoever. Second, the lyrics are downright corny. Third, the hard image they portray is a joke. Give them some credit for an orignal image to portray, but they are just another band trying to imitate Korn."
1,One of the biggest freakin Dissapointments in a while,"Ive got ""live at Tomfest"", Ive got the ""warriors ep"" and Ive got ""snuff the punk"". I have also seen them in concert twice. I have to say that this is one of the most dissapointing albums ive ever heard. I couldnt help see definite resemblance to bizkit and korn, and I hate those bands! Guys what happened? Im not a christian, But i love your music. And this album really sucks. I get so bored listening to it. And why is it so over-produced? I think that a pod album deserves a bit of roughness. But you guys got all kinds of stupid effects on this thing. Im sorry, I just dont like it. I havent been this let down by a cd since rancid released ""life wont wait"" another bundle of junk."
4,Deserving of their fame,"Probably my favorite rap-rock cd. These guys lay down some huge riffs and great hooks. Their sense of melody is very good, and they know how to let a song breathe and develop. My taste in music has changed a bit since I first got into POD, but their skill and passion gives them credibility as a band that will be remembered some day for more than just exploiting a trend."
4,Heavy Tunes w/a Positive Message,"I first heard POD when I saw the video for ""Rock The Party"" and was a little turned off by the stereotypical Korn-y look but after hearing the rest of the disc I was happy to discover these guys are very talented. ""Southtown"" and ""Rock The Party"" are cool songs but the gems are ""Set Your Eyes to Zion"" with some beautiful guitar & vocal work and ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" just absolutely crushes! Also the tune they did for Sandler's ""Little Nicky"" ""School of Hard Knocks"" kicks...{butt] !! Bonus points for rockin' for God!"
3,Eh,"I was fairly unimpressed by The Fundamental Elements. There was a good message, and Southtown and Rock the Party were good songs, but other than that, I was pretty disappointed with the album."
4,WOW!,"This is an awesome CD. But would have to be far more powerful to be compared to bands like Rage Against The Machiene and KoRn. The only problem I had with the CD was I could not relate to alot of it unlike RATM and KoRn and of course Limp Bizkit. My favourite songs are Rock The Party,Holly Wood,Southdown and Lie Down. A great CD and cant wait till thier next CD"
2,Doesn't quite do it....,"Upon hearing their single ""Southtown"" the first time, I wasn't really into it much. The song slowly started to grow on me, and after a while it did become a pretty cool tune. So, I thought I'd give the album a try. Unfortunately, hearing the album made me realize why I didn't like ""southtown"" in the first place. It's not the worst thing I've heard, but I give it a low rating because I don't find much originality in their sound. If you're an absolute die-hard fan of the hip-hop/hardcore world, you'll probably dig this album, but if you're looking for originality and creativeness, you should look elsewhere."
1,Good disc... after listening to it a few times.,"Nothing to say, so let's get right into the songs.Greetings - Nice intro. ""Jah people ride on.""Hollywood - Good song about the ""glamour life"" of Hollywood.Southtown - Best song on the entire album; about the community of San Ysidro, California.Checkin' Levels - Cool intro to Rock the Party.Rock the Party (Off the Hook) - ""We came to rock the party all night long!""Lie Down - 5 minutes of screaming...Set Your Eyes to Zion - ""Jah Jah people ride on..."" Guitar-driven reggae.Lo Siento - Filler.Bullet the Blue Sky - Best cover song ever.Psalm 150 - Filler.Image - I like the guitar in this song.Shouts - Filler.Tribal - ""I and I Jah Jah Warrior!""Freestyle - Exactly what it says.Follow Me - ""Almighty Reign! Almighty I!""Outkast - ""I'm an outkast, but don't count me out."""
1,Don't waste your money,"I wasted my money, but fortunately my local CD store accepts returns, even if opened. This is being returned. I heard a couple of their songs on the radio, so I bought the CD. One word...Mistake. The song Rock the Party is the big song on the Cd and it's not even that good. The rest of the tracks are very similar hiphop/rock sound."
1,Is this a joke?,"Man, this is awful. I took a listen to this album that is being promoted on many other pages, and to be honest, this thing really reeks. Why? First of all, it's the same boring chug-a-chug Korn/Bizkit nonsense that's playing on the radio. Second, these guys look exactly like the members of Korn (how lame is that?). Third, all I hear is the vocalist whining, moaning, and yelling (like Korn again), only it's all about religious mumbo-jumbo. God this and God that, gets annoying really quick. I don't listen to music to be told how to live my life.Essentially, what we have here are a bunch of musical evangelists - the Stryper for the '90s. And that band was a joke. They also ruined a great U2 song on here. I say if you like the rap/rock fusion check out Rage or Dial-7 - the lyrics and music are far more interesting."
1,"another ""Korn"" band. oh boy","And this time we have dread lock fools singing about god and happy things. What ever happen to cool bands like Slayer? I thought this album was going to be good after hearing such good stuff. When i put it in i found out i was wrong. Can we please stop with the Korn bands! This album is nothing but a bunch of wanna be aggro people singing about god and how god is cool. MMMMMMMK. Yes i want to jam to so god ol' fashion hardcore god music! AVOID THIS ALBUM AT ALL COST! Go buy some Slayer, Six Feet Under, Morbid Angel or something besides this weak korn rip off! S.O.D. is a better band than P.O.D. will ever be."
4,hey its p.o.d you got to like them,yeah these guys are really good i never listen to stuff like this but theres something about this one that just is so good set you eyes to zion is a good song these guys have there own cool style thats like a 3 in one which is way cool you HAVE to buy this cd if you like rap/rock together.
4,jonno,"This was a great cd, but with a few songs it didn't have very much difficulty with the guitars or drums (It soounded the same the whole song), but that's only in a few songs, in songs like ""Southtown"", or""Lie down"" and other songs they are awesome, they have awesome screaming and heavy guitars. It is a great cd, I recommend it to people who like rap-core music, or just heavy metal music."
5,P.O.D. ONCE AGAIN SETS IT OFF!!!,"Musically P.O.D. dominates. Molding so many different styles all in one like they do is simply amazing. I can't help ""BOBBIN'"" my head or thrashing my head, depending on which song is playing. Beyond the music, P.O.D. brings a message to the masses that has been needing to be delivered for SOO very long. GET THIS CD. IT IS AWESOME. Ride on!"
5,MAKE THE NEXT CD YOU BUY THIS ONE!,"""Fundamental Elements of Southtown, is a Molotov cocktail of molten metal and spiritual uplift that couches the band's holy-rolling anthems in ear-ringing guitars and neck-snapping beats."" -Spin Magazine Sept. 1999 pg. 82nuff said."
5,Awesome,"Awesome disc, definately one of the best Christian bands I've ever heard. The lyrics are awesome as well, even if you aren't a Christian, you will still like them. And 99.9% of Christian music is NOT copying secular bands, as an extremely intelligent person *cough-cough* (a-hem, sorry... somethin in my throat...a-hem...) has stated in his review. I know a few of them do but definately 99.9% is a huge exaggeration. When you find secular bands that sound like Five Iron Frenzy, Earthsuit, POD, or Skillet, let me know buddy. Until then, I'll be praying for the mental institute to accept you as a new patient. I mean all of this is the nicest of ways and do not intend to insult anyone. *cough-cough* (ahh, I better take some cough medicine... a-hem, a-hem.....) Thank you."
3,Thank GOD that I made it alive...,"I'm very, very disappointed that people have used such phrases as ""so much better than korn and rage....a must buy!"" to describe this CD. It's not a must buy.The rock/rap fusion is pretty good, P.O.D. definitely has a Korn/Deftones sound going, but the CD is, well, nothing special...It's hard to listen to the whole way through. Certain songs, like ""southtown"", just catch your attention, but stuff like ""checkin' levels"" just makes me want to throw the damn CD across the room...But, P.O.D. is certainly not equal to Korn or Rage. P.O.D. is okay, but both Head & Munky and Morello blow this guitarist away, and both Jon and Zach write better lyrics (""here in the southtown, hey ya know that kid don't play, put it down in the streets, will i see another day if i make it back this time? gots ta hold what is mine and thank god that i made it alive..."" just doesn't strike me as quality lyrics)In general, buy it, if you feel you want it enough. It's a tolerable CD."
3,"This is P.O.D.'s Peak, imo..","The Bullet the Blue Sky cover gives it a three. This is the best song on here, imo. The other songs are ok, some catchy hooks here and there. There's a little filler, which I always skip. The main riff from Hollywood sounds like it was 'borrowed' from the chorus of Thomas Dolby's ""She Blinded Me With Science"" and sped up, lol. Greetings is pretty cool as well as Outkast. I also like the clean guitars in Tribal Warriors. Overall it's an ok album if you dig this style of rock."
3,GOOD!,"I'm pretty picky about the music I listen to, so I'm hesitant to give this album five stars. If the option allowed for it, I'd give it 3.5 stars. P.O.D. drops diversity throughout FEOS with hard rock (Hollywood, Bullet the Blue Sky), hip hop (Checkin Levels, Rock the Party), mellow reggae (Set Your Eyes to Zion), rapcore (Lie Down, OutKast) and smooth rockin with free flowin hip hop vocals with a gritty edge(Tribal, Freestyle). There are a few songs that lagged in catching my listening ear. But, as for the rest of the album, it's pure ear candy with bleeding passion and nuggets of lyrical wisdom. I hear people compare these guys to Deftones, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. What have I to say to them is: WRONG. Yeah, they have a similar style, but they're in a class of they're own.Be sure to check out their song WHATEVER IT TAKES off the ANY GIVEN SUNDAY sdtk! Wish that one was on FEOS! W.I.T. RIPS IT UP!"
4,"Excellent music, excellent message","This cd is one powerful piece of music! I work with teenagers at my church, and this cd stands alone as one that the churched and unchurched alike love to hear. The music is driving, and their version of ""Bullet..."" is actually better than the original (much like Mortal did to U2's ""One Tree Hill"" years ago). Money well-spent and a cd you'll leave in the player for a loooong time."
5,Got it Right,"5 Stars on the fact that this band has got it right. After reading an article on the guitar player in Guitar World, I don't think I could have more respect for him or this band. A real good CD with heavier rap/rock sounds. Rap/rock is not exactly my cup of tea, but I love this record! God blessed you guys with this great talent, keep it up!"
3,"OK, but not as great as some others...","As a Christian rock music fan, I am happy to see a Christian band becoming popular in the secular realm. However, this CD is not that great. It has some real good songs, such as ""Southtown"", ""Set Your Eyes to Zion"", and ""Rock the Party"", but overall the CD is lacking. Some of POD's older stuff is better than this, even though they are not mastered as well. If you want really good hardcore, listen to EDL, Blindside, and Like David. They are much better."
4,"RAP METAL ACTUALLY HAS A HOOK, A BEAT AND MOST OF ALL RHYTHM","I am usually not the hard rocker type, but POD delivers!Their songs which are heavy in metal and rap are consistent with good rhythms, beats, and hooks.A very entertaining CD, which gets you up rocking."
4,"After listening a few times, it's awesome","I initially didn't like this CD. That was my mistake. This album is fun and lively. It is full of rap/rock lyrics and beats. The song Southtown is awesome, it is the best on the CD. Rock the Party is the song being played on the radio, it rocks! The whole CD is one you can listen to from beginning to end and not have to skip songs. It has a unique sound that is heavy rock, but apeals to everyone. They are similar to Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach in many ways, but different by adding their own ""twists"". This is the first album I have bought from them, but I understand they have others out. You won't be disapointed."
4,Southtown Review,"Well, this is perhaps one of the best albums that ive ever heard.Ill give yall a review on each song1.Greetings-just an intro,ok though2.Hollywood-could be better,but not bad3.Southtown-got that Nirvana sound to it,good message and overall a great song4.Checkin Levels-a pretty cool intro5.Rock the party-this is a good song,has a great mix6.Lie down-one of my favorites,has the screaming in it7.Set your eyes to Zion-great song Right On8.Lo Siento-short intro,nothing big9.Bullet the Blue Sky-wow!this song is great.ive never heard the U2 version,but this is probably better10.Psalm 150-cool intro11.Image-not so great of a song,but still worth listening to12.Shouts-this intro is the worst one in my opinion13.Tribal-pretty good song,has that good chorus sound14.Freestyle-a great ""rap"" sound in it15.Follow me-not too good,not too bad16.Outkast-possibly the greatest song,even though it is really long.the sing/scream thing Sonny has goin on is awesome,never skip this song!"
5,Jah!,"I enjoy POD's harder, older stuff. This is no exception. At first it felt a bit over-produced, but the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me."
3,A good major label debut.,"I welcome the rest of the world to what many of us in the 'Christian rock' scene have known for ten years. This band kicks. POD sound good here and the new originals they have come up with are quite good-especially ""Tribal Warriors"", ""Set Your Eyes To Zion"", and ""Hollywood"". As for ""Southtown"" itself, I prefer the raw version on the ""Warriors E.P."" but this one is pretty good too. Perhaps its the polishing around the edges, but I like my POD raw and angry, not smooth and silky. So this disc is a mixed blessing-it offers the band the exposure they deserve, but sacrifices a bit on the overall intensity. Still, an enjoyable record with many high points."
5,"Awesome, period.",All I can say is that hardcore albums don't get any better. Check out P.O.D. if you haven't already.
5,Kickin,"They rock they don't swear they're not druggies, alchoholics. And most importantly they ROCK HARD. More than Korn, or Limp, and can rap almost as good as wyclef (but who can rap better than him). Fred could learn something"
1,Disappointing,"I returned these almost immediately they arrived. The plastic they are made from is much cheaper than it looks in the picture, and was dirty from where the tins had rubbed against other things. The stand kept falling sideways, and the magnets were glued on very poorly, with strings of glue all over the back on the tins, and the magnets off center. Some of the lids stuck, others didn't fit tightly enough. Overall, not worth the money. I bought a set of metal ones instead, and am much happier with them."
1,Will not charge EP096FL,"This unit will not charge my EP096FL RCA battery. It acts as though the battery is at full charge. I have just put the battery on the original RCA charger and it has been charging for 20 minutes and is still going. This unit has some sensor problems with this model of battery. In summary, for my purposes, this charger is worthless. Good-bye $$$$."
4,A lovely quilt story that includes a pattern for the quilt.,"The Tortilla Quilt is a well told story of how a little girl came to make a quilt. She not only learned the mechanics of quilt making, but found out why quilts are so special as she and her friend cut pieces of fabric from the dresses they had outgrown. She loved the quilt so much when it was done, that she wanted to share that love with her grandmother and gave her the quilt as a gift. Through her generosity she learned that a quilt can bring you even more joy when you share it.The folk-art illustrations by Jane Tenorio-Coscarelli are as delightful as her quilting. At the end of the book there is a recipe for her grandmother's tortillas and a pattern for the nine-piece quilt that appeared in the story. Also, scattered throughout the story are Spanish interpretations - not for the whole story, but for random words."
3,Summer sounds sweet,"Emma Anderson (formerly of the fab band Lush)and Lisa O'Neill are the core of Sing-Sing but from the sound of this cd you would think Phil Spector was also a member of the group. ""Feels Like Summer"" even contains an almost subliminal sample of ""Mony Mony"" by Tommy James and the Shondelles. Emma and Lisa have crafted a very catchy and pretty record here, anyone who is a fan of well produced 60's style pop mixed with electronic drum beats and Emma's tradmark guitar style should enjoy this. However, the re-mix of ""Feels like Summer"" was probably unecessary."
5,Multi Genius,"Kris Kristofferson surely ranks at the top of America's great song writers. And what is remarkable about this album is that is singing is good too. He is at his best on ""For The Good Times"", ""Why Me"", ""Nobody Wins"" and ""Please Dont Tell Me How the Story Ends."" I was a bit disappointed in this version of ""Loving Her Was Easier"" but why quibble. This is the best work of an authentic American institution."
4,Anything by Kris Kristofferson is a favorite of mine,"Have listened to and loved Kris and his songs for at least 20 years. Am only sorry that he has given up writung and touring, I used to see him every chance I had. Wish he would go back to writing his songs again."
5,The very spirit of country music,"Maybe it's easier for me to judge this album, because I haven't heard original versions of Kristofferson's songs. For me ""The Austin Sessions"" represent the very spirit of country music. The arrangements, the lyrics, the tunes - everything is perfect. Country music isn't very popular in Russia, but I'm sure, after listening to this album, people would understand, why there are so many fans of all over the world. You don't need to be a Caruso to sing country songs - Kris prooves it with every track. You need to have something inside you - a spirit of old good times, when everything seemed so simple and plain..."
5,Kris Has Done It Again,"Kris is a true legend in his own time. His music is so natural it just blends right in with his rough, honest voice. Listening to this CD is just like goin' home. He's brought back his old songs with some great harmony with Vince Gill, Stevey Earle, Allison Krause and others. No one can write music like Kris. So honest, so basic - without all the drama, polish, the glitZ, he just plain tells it like it is."
3,not really,"all the good songs are here, but, all the older versions are better, the voice is quite faded, disappointed."
2,Kris sounds tired,"I am disappointed...Kristopherson talks his way through. I think his lack of enthusiasm comes through in the music. Kris blew a good opportunity to introduce a new generation to these great songs. ""But then again..That's just my opinion and I could be wrong."""
4,Kris is the Clint Eastwood of the music business,"Lets be honest, Kris does not have a golden voice, but then again, neither does Bob Dylan. Reading through the words of these songs I remember why I listened to him in the past, real words with meaning, that you can truly believe that Kris has lived. No fluff here. A couple of tracks could have had a bit more effort in the performance, but even those are worth the listen. This is a keeper and will surely gather no dust in my collection. Well done Kris, you're a man's man, with a heart."
1,Kris has lost it,"Kris never had a good voice, but he sang with feeling. Listening to him was like listening to a down and outer that happened to be a great poet. You could tell he believed every song he sang. I am happy for him that he is in recovery and has stopped drinking. He has been married for 14 years and is a grandfather.That is great. However, he has lost his emotion. He is no longer singing this as a down and outer but more as someone saying here are my hits. Even ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" sounded up beat. If you want to hear the old Kris buy ""The Silver-Tongued Devil and I"". That was a great CD."
2,I deducted three stars for the mixing on this album.,"I adore Kristofferson's voice and lyrics, but this record reminded me of Natalie Cole's attempt to add her voice to her father's recordings. The guest artists seemed pasted over the top of, rather than blended into, the music, as though they weren't necessarily in the studio at the same time Kris was."
4,IndieReader Review,"A gut-wrenchingly honest look at a family dealing with schizophrenia, A Multitude of Mercies travels from the depths of despair to the ultimate triumph of love and acceptance.The story, told with humor and great sensitivity, explores each character's weaknesses as they try to deal with the changes brought on by this devastating illness.A must-read for anyone touched by mental illness, A Multitude of Mercies reveals the loneliness and confusion which comes with the condition, and treats the subject with dignity and compassion.Reviewed by IR Staff"
1,A work of Fiction,"As someone who spent 2.5 years in RVN (one year as a crewchief/gunner) and a lifetime career in aviation as a F/W Commerical Pilot and A&P mechanic (most of that on Bell Helicopters), I found this book disappointing. In fact the book belongs in the FICTION Catagory. There were so many discrepancies in the book I don't know where to begin. But I will say this, I NEVER had any doubt in my mind when I was being shot at. And I didn't have to hear a ""ping"" to know it. The sound of a close 7.62 will get your attention and a 12.7 mm will scare the s**t out of you. Perhaps the Capt. has told so many war stories he began to believe them himself but for someone who was there and did that, his war stories are BS."
1,A great work..............of fiction :-(,"This a clearly a book where they author has taken several things that he heard from others, a litle bid of his own experince and then inflated the whole thing.There are too many things in this book that don't fit what happend.I have read other books about A troop 1/9 Cav, and it clear that this author has lent/stolen varius bits and used them with a nice twist in his own bookAnd to make the fatal error of refering to his own platoon (ei the lift platoon) as ""blue platoon"" when everybody know that theBlue platoon are the ARP.Don't buy it, its work of fiction....Mr Alexander....shame on you, you disgrace the ones who gave all"
1,"Apparently exaggerated, but definitely unoriginal.","If you liked Chickenhawk, by Robert Mason, you don't have to read this book by Alexander and Sasser, because you already read the good bits, which were copied word-for-word from Chickenhawk. Check out the Wikipedia article on Chickenhawk for the low-down."
3,Pages Too Thin,"You want to really enjoy being in and reading your bible. Sadly, I love this bible except that the pages are too thin. It is frustrating because it really is beautiful in a number of ways. However, it is extremely easy to wrinkle the pages and tear them -- even when trying to take care of them. I was just studying and tore a page inadvertantly and decided I should write this review. I've had a number of much less expensive bibles where the pages have held up much much better. I was hoping to spend a little more money and keep this bible a long time. I've had it only a few months and I'm already I'm looking for a replacement. If you plan to actually spend a lot of time in and study out of this bible, I would not recommend it. Sorry!"
2,Disappointed,"Although the Bible is beautiful, the pastoral helps were a huge disappointment. I was hoping for suggested worship/funeral/wedding (even hospital visit) formats/helps which are not there. I would not recommend this particular Bible to anyone who is looking for anything more than a nice looking Bible in a faithful translation."
2,Superior Bibles to this are available,"Pages and cover are thin. Ribbon markers are skinny. Font and singlecolumn text are delightful, which is the reason for my purcahse.Some useful ministerial information in the back is enjoyable reading.I do not prefer this translation to KJV, NKJV, ESV or NASB."
4,A Good Versatile Camera At A Moderate Price,"...the leica c3 is a good versatile camera at a moderate price, in my humble opinion, and should make a good traveling companion (perhaps as a backup) for those impromptu moments......for naturalists and outdoor enthusiasts, the camera's wide-angle capability, alone, may be worth the price, as it is difficult to find point-and-shoot compacts with this feature......the vario-elmar lens (the same as used on leica's new cm zoom 35 - 70 which retails for around $1.2k) produces sharp and nearly 3-d quality images which are slightly better than the images from my older olympus zoom wide 80 compact......some negatives include a film door that did not close properly (but was repaired by leica on a one-month turn-around time basis), and a jammed film rewinder button......if you want the best zoom compact camera available go for the new leica cm zoom...if you want wide-angle capability at a moderate price, the leica c3 should not disappoint..."
5,Awesome Book!!,"I had this book for my anthropology class (Kirin Narayan is a professor here at University of Wisconsin - Madison) and though more often than not I find assigned books to be boring, this one was the opposite and I read it more than once and kept it at the end of the year instead of selling it back because I thought it was so great. Ms. Narayan visited our class one day and talked to us about how she had to learn Urmila Devi Sood's dialect before she could talk with her and record the folktales. I love the folktales in this book!! This is a great book to own!"
4,Stretching out Tex-Mex,"Accordionista Joel Guzman and his vocalist partner Sarah Fox take Tex-Mex folk traditions by the horns with their debut, and shake up the old ways by injecting modern jazz improvisational elements into the dance party like no one has before. I'm particularly enamored with ""Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used To?"", mainly for Fox's sultry bebop inflections and Guzman's squeezebox ride that puts him in same league as Steve Jordan and Flaco Jimenez at his most adventurous. Some of the lyrical content could use some toughening up, or at least a little more introspection, but this debut is exciting enough to start anticipating the next one, as long as Fox belts out her lines and Guzman gets to riff."
5,"Good Adapter, if you're careful","I came to know this adapter when I bought my first Good Digital Camera. A Olympus C-4000 Zoom. To my knowledge, this is the only adapter that will work with that camera. The Lenmar Pro-37 has a 6.5 volt charge that coincides with the camera. You have to make sure to unplug the adapter anytime it's not in use because if you leave it plugged in, it will burn up. I smelled plastic burning one night and couldn't figure out what it was. Sometime later, I wanted to use the adapter with my camera somewhere away from home, went to unplug it and found the source of the burning plastic oder....there was a hole burned in the top of the adapter. I have now replace the old one, and since there is a pretty heavy price for this item, and also is now getting hard to find, I learned a good lesson from it."
3,Junglism,An overal hit here with a great mix of some old greats (and a few not so greats) I would have given this a 4 star rating but for the sometimes intrusive and annoying scratching by DJ Hype which in some cases tends to impose on the hypnotic Dub style Bass during the beginning and end of some of the tunes.
2,Not Tuff Enough,"This pillow was pretty & soft but my Bull Mastiff chewed a hole in it & removed the stuffing within a few hours after I put it in her crate. The top part is nice & soft but the bottom of the pillow is a Very thin linen type of material, NOT durable for dogs who chew."
4,Difficult and rewarding,"This book is my introduction to Nathaniel Mackey. His poetry is very multicultural - Siberian, Ancient Egyptian, Bedoin ... and draws from music, religious practices, myths ... as such is is demanding of a reader. The poetry has a rhythm very skillfully controlled by the poet - sometimes traditional, sometimes natural, and at times very delibrately jarring. Repetition is another poetic tool he uses skillfully and subtly. The poems are closely interwined - many being parts of series of poem - giving the collection a sense of wholeness often missing in poet's booksized publications - so intertwined I was surprised at the quantity of prior publications of the poems.The subject matter is frequently mystical but sometimes social. In all the poems need to be read multiple times and read with a holistic mind not a linear, verbal mind ... but the effort involved is well rewarded."
2,French Film Stars,"I've admired Tom Tierney's paper dolls for years, so I guess it was because of my high expectations that my disappointment with this book was so huge. The illustrations were not up to his usual standard. The only accurate portrayals were of Juliette Binoche and Capucine. The Leslie Caron, Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Adjani dolls bore no resemblance to the actresses whatsoever, and the others weren't that great either.It was also strange that one of the greatest stars of French cinema, Arletty, was not included while a relative newcomer like Audrey Tautou was.There was also an odd note in the text saying that Capucine and Audrey Hepburn became friends before they were famous, when both had been house models for Givenchy. Audrey Hepburn met Givenchy when she approached him to design costumes for ""Sabrina"". She was never his house model. It makes me wonder how accurate the notes about the other actresses were."
2,Adequate for the beginner,"This book covers the technical basics fairly well, if you don't take the claims of scientific validity too seriously. It does not address markmanship fundamentals in enough detail to be useful; it recommends formal training to accomplish that task. The overpowering ego makes the reading a bit difficult at times, but the data is mostly there."
2,Past and Present,"BLOW OUT gives the reader Savich and Sherlock, together and enjoying life but as a story it lacks substance. Maybe Ms. Coulter needs to retire these characters or move on to another subject. The psychic end of the story just doesn't work. Meeting a ghost on a lonely road asking for help was used by Wilkie Collins and too many time since to make good reading.I've enjoyed this author's work, but this one seems to be written to a formula or contrived by an editor's hand to meet a contract commitment. Series fans will enjoy the story, but this one is not strong enough to attract new readers.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Much darker than pictured,The color of this rug is more of a very dark camel than the cream pictured. I read other reviews that it was darker and I thought it may still work but it was in a completely different color family. The quality was great for the price (I have had the dark brown version in my front entry for 8 months and it still looks great) but I had to return this one because the color is so off.
1,I still did not get the second rug !!!!!,"I ordered 3 rugs I have reserved only 2 so far they are very nice rugs , but I am still waiting for the third one."
3,Sounds pretty much like his other operas,I have listened to 2 other Janacek operas: Mackerras' Katya Kabanova (the 2nd version) and Haitink's Jenufa. Vec Makropulos sounds almost exactly like those other two. Elizabeth Soderstrom is particularly good. If you just love Janacek's operas then you'll probably love Vec Makropulos. But if your not quite that enthusiastic about them then skip this one because like I said it sounds pretty much like his others.
3,It's OK,"Frogger 2 is nowheres near as good as Frogger He's Back. The levels are too easy, and the double hop makes it almost a cakewalk. The music's not as good either. Blah Blah Blah."
1,Right Wing Drivel,"Well, I ordered this in hopes it might have some historicly relevant references - it does not. Velma Angel (the name of the auther should have been a warning) goes on and on about how our society has been destroyed by the evils of daytime tv dramas. It is rather like listening to the twisted rhetoric of Pat Buchanan or Jerry Falwell. If it was not for the fact that people like this are so dangerously evil, it would be very funny."
2,just an okay cd,most of the songs on this CD are unlistenable for parents. Maybe the kids will like them ...
2,Disappointing for the series,"I bought this CD for the kids because we LOVED the ""Celebration of Song"" and ""Celebration of Rock & Roll"" albums from the same series. This one, however, was a real disappointment. Very few of the songs are good for singing along, and the lyrics of several of the songs are unintelligle. The producers have used a lot of filler (e.g., three tracks of ""Be kind to your web-footed friends,"" none of them good), and some obvious classics are missing. Overall very disappointing! There are a few bright spots, however. My kids love Cheech, the School Bus Driver and there's a great track from Buckwheat Zydeco's children's album."
5,Fun in the car,"A year later, my five year old son still loves this CD. We play it in the car all the time. Unlike some children's cds, the songs on this one aren't annoying for the grown up. I sing along and enjoy it too."
2,Cheap Quality,"Very cheap quality plastic and parts. Unlike what the description says, there are no slots for the iPod Classic specifically. The closest part was the ""iPod Video 30/60GB"" slot. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it works when connected. But you might want to skip this and get one that's better made. And if you have a iPod Classic, don't even bother. I'm glad I got this with the car recharger cuz at least I can use that when I find a better cradle. Very disappointed."
5,Great concert,I saw the Moody Blues in concert years ago and I've always loved their music.This is a great performance and the picture quality is wonderful.
5,Tough Jeans,"They fit good, and are they tough. They are heavier than most, therefore hotter in the summer but they will last for years."
5,Great jeans at a great price,"My boyfried loved the jeans! Even though I ordered them very close to Christmas, Amazon and their affiliates came through for me. I received them with time to spare."
4,pineapples and coffee,"I got hooked on these pineapples years ago when you could buy them at the Wal-Mart. Now, I can't find them there so I checked on Amazon to see if they sold them. They are delicious with coffee. I will continue buying this product. They are shipped on time and in resealable bags."
3,"Different, yet good...","This isn't your normal type of SF story. AT least not the kinds I have read. Most of the story did not have a SF feel to it, but the plot was interesting enough to make it an enjoyable read. The book did open up interesting possibilities for sequels, so we'll see where the story goes from there."
5,Man oh Man!!!,Very good repeats itself quite a bit but worth it!! You follow the adventures of a man who is looking to avenge his famies death (common enough plot) but what he finds will blow you away. If you love Alternate History it is a must buy!!!
3,Has some good points,"Barnes does an excellent job of describing a Cosmos of infinite worlds where history is totally different. The concept was new, exciting and fascinating. Sadly, his slavish devotion to feminism and other Liberal political jabs really took some of the wind out the sails of this otherwise excellent work. All in all I do recommend it."
4,Alternate history that tastes great but is less filling.,"A decent little light romp. Very implausable, multiple alternate histories requiring intervention by a group of future superscience good guys with, of course, a contemporary dude who just happens to possess the required skills needed to join the fight. Full of heros who can't be beaten no matter what the odds and beautiful busty female sidekicks who can kick ass and take names on their own. Makes you wonder how they got into the mess that they're in. probobly going to be a truly interminable series. Nothing to really sink your teeth into, still, good fun"
2,Umm...TRICK TRAINER - I get it now,If you are buying this dog because you were looking for a moving - walking talking type toy - you are sadly mistaken. The decription for this toy is HIGLY misleading. It does not do any tricks and you can't train it. I was thinking like maybe a furby type action would be taking place. Instead when I got it - It is a stuffed animal with magnets in its paws and nose. So you can make the toy move with the magnets but it does not really do anything like it claims to. The TRICK was they got you to spend 25 dollars for it - thinking it was going to be trainable like the nindendogs game is. I would recommend that the company pursue making an actual working dog along these lines. Rather than what I got from them.
3,The TRICK is you cant TRAIN it!!!,If you are looking to buy a MOVING toy this is not it. If however you want a stuffed animal with a magnet in his nose and the toy bone that comes with him - then this is the toy for you. I bought this because the description lead me to believe it was interactive in some way - it is not. It is however a very cute stuffed animal - but I do not think its worth the price tag.
5,Most impressive!,"In the study of consciousness and what it means to be a functional and aware entity, one quickly realises that no single academic discipline is sufficient to even scratch the surface. Dr. Pickover's Sex, Drugs, Einstein, & Elves is a wonderful tour of what is currently being talked about, researched, and explored in the science of humanity, and yet manages to fool you into thinking you are doing nothing more than some light afternoon reading about, well.. stuff. The broad range of topics are skillfully woven into each other in a way that really makes the book accessable to anyone regardless of age, education, or experience. The fact that Dr. Pickover manages to keep a wonderfully vibrant personal tone throughout the whole book just adds that final element that makes this a 'Must Read' for just about everybody."
4,This book could be a drug itself,"Just simply a fascinating read. I had my copy on the coffee table during a party, and one guest picked it up casually, and never put it down throughout the whole event.This book is just a wildly ecclectic assortment of essays, but taken as a whole it is much more than that. I think it changed my view of the world."
1,Pointless mental meanderings,"This was my first book by Pickover, and it will be my last. His chapters can be entertaining, but ultimately they lead nowhere, and cast no light into the dark corners of the universe. For a scientist and self-proclaimed skeptic, he seems a bit enamoured with new age mysticism. In one chapter, he talked about writing down and trying to achieve 100 goals in life. If one of his goals was to write a pointless, self-promoting book, he can check that goal off his list."
2,All head and no heart..,This is a boastful and rambling diatribe by a sub-par writer. It contains some interesting facts and even insights that could have led somewhere in more capable hands. This books has intelligence but little wisdom. Written by someone who claims to have an ecological mindset but then sets down morbid futures where humans become machines as fact. He waxes about the complexity of dolphin languages and then talks about how he loves to eat rare fish. He is a professor who has read about much and deeply experienced little. Intelligence that is not tempered by compassion is sad indeed.
5,Excellent book!,"The thing that makes this book great, is that Royals tells you the exact type and name brand of paints to purchase in order to achieve these effects. Showing a color of a ""tan"" may not be the color you need to achieve certain results, because there are several tans. She shows you the stencils used and takes you step by step. It helps to know a little about shading and highlighting to get the results you're after. Very,very happy with this book. Great price also."
1,Godawful Sound Quality,"The ridiculously poor sound quality on this CD would not even pass for a 10th generation cassette bootleg. Many of the songs are on other collections. See the Freddie Mercury box set . . it's pricey, but ""I Can Hear Music"" and ""Going Back"" sound MUCH better, leading me to believe that whoever ""mastered"" this CD wanted to pass these off as ""very rare, and thus with low fidelity quality."" Rubbish. Also check out ""In Nuce,"" which isn't much better, but at least the sound on that one is a bit superior to this. Also, Brian May fans need not get their hopes up when looking at the track list and seeing pre-Queen song titles. If he's even playing on some of these tracks (which I'm also certain he is NOT), there's nothing new under the sun to groove to. This is so bad, even the worst track on ""Hot Space"" would be essential listening!"
3,historical recordings,"C'mon, gentlemen, what did you expect ? There is, and forever, only one first Queen album. This is not a ""number zero"" album.This album compiles 14 historical recordings, recorded before Queen's first efforts. So, it is very interesting to hear what they were doing in those days, alone or with friends. No more, no less.If you have every official recording by the group, this will complete your collection."
3,Bom para fs,"Para fs do Queen √© muito legal conhecer seus prim√≥rdios com bandas pr√©.A qualidade no √© excelente, nem as m√∫sicas, mas vale o documento."
1,I wish I that I never saw this album,"Probably the worst Album I have bought: I was so smug when I saw this for sale. It sounds absolutely ghastly, I have old, stretched and worn cassettes that sound better. My only recommendation is buy it so taht you too can be taken in."
2,Historical Interest Only,"Sound quality varies widely. You can hear their search for what would become the ""Queen"" sound. Their playing and vocals lack the confidence that would make their later musical excursions so interesting and enjoyable. I never expected to hear them cover Dusty Springfield, though they do a nice job on it, it's jarring when you're looking for a blitz like ""Killer Queen"". This collection is for archivists who want to be complete their collection or pull out a novelty. The recordings are too inconsistent in both style and production values (demos? cassette recordings.. reproductions?) to place in the player and let it roll for listening pleasure."
5,Wonderful! The best of Elif Safak!,"I think this is her best novel so far. I think this book includes some realities that most people would indefinitely feel obliged to accept.the ending is superb, just right for the book itself."
3,tales from modern life,"I found this tale of modern love, eating disorders, angst, young adulthood and assimilation a good read with a rather dissapointing ending. It felt like at the end of the story it unravelled instead of resolved. (Intentional?)"
1,Abysmal English,"Stiff unnatural English, hints of the camera eye of Robbe Grillet, boring treatises on diacritical marks standing in for the losses of the poor dear immigrant shades of Salman Rushdie without credit.It reads like an intelligent high school student with a college level dictionary of English writing away.Every line of tin dialogue is modified with a fancy descriptive verb standing in for ""said.""How did this book get published in English? What language was it translated from? Who translated it like this?"
1,"Good concept, bad design!","I was excited when I saw this item in the store. However, when I got home to use it, I was not impressed. I could not hear the music from my MP3 player on my stereo at home and when I tried to use it with my car stereo it sounded like crap. This could be a very good accessory once the kinks are worked out."
1,Not of any value to me,"In my area the preset FM stations all conflict with existing FM radio stations. It does not work well enough to even use. Even if there were no conflict with existing stations, the quality of the sound did not seem very good. For me it was a waste of money.Maybe in a car a long ways from other FM radio station it might have some value."
1,ugh!,Just bought this at WalMart ($20!) and will be returning it tonight. Only one of the 4 88 stations is empty here but still couldn't hear the music over the hiss and static. I vaguely knew of this products reputation but bought it anyway...big mistake.
3,Ok,"It works great at home on my little stereo but in the car it is another story. I live in Az and most of the 88 stations are filled with mariachi music so I could not get a clean station. I had to hold the unit in my hand to get a signal that was less dominated by static while my iPod was playing (I guess I have enough electricity in my body to give it more power). Even then sometimes the weirdest thing would happen, if I was stopped at a light and someone pulled up beside me sometimes I would pick up their station all of a sudden (not always but still...) I decided to keep it in the house for my stereo and I am purchasing the iRiver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter to try in my car. It seems to have more power and choice of stations. EDIT:(I did buy the other transmitter and it works wonderfully!)"
4,Belkin TuneCast Portable Music FM Transmitter (F8V367-APL),"At first I bought this product and it absolutely sucked. Poor sound quality, impossible to listen to. Saw some of the other reviews about adding headphone extension cord and it works great. Went to radio shack got 20ft of headphone extension cord, put it in the pocket behind my seat and now the sounds is much better. Only time quality sucks is with heavy bass or very electronic sounds. Good product. I wish it had the ac adapter to plug into cig lighter just so I would never need to turn it on and off."
1,Save your money,"I tried this FM transmitter and it was very disappointing. The range was poor and sound quality was poor and prone to static. It sounded about like an AM station. I tried all 4 channels and had to have the transmitter within 2' of the car antenna to get a signal that even approached listenable. I don't know yet if any of the other inexpensive (ok, cheap) FM transmitters are any better but I will find out. I do not suggest this unit unless you don't really care about the sound quality. The Akron SF-120 was a little better but the tuning was very sensitive."
1,Bad Product,"Brand new batteries, I had to sit with in two feet of the antenna. Then is worked fine. At any distance other than two feet it did not work at all. The signals coming in on 88.5 were practically non existent. For the folks that get this to work "" more power to them "" but really, this does not work. I gave it one star because I am not out that much money. I don't see how companies can put out stuff like this. Don't buy product. Thank you."
2,"If you live in the city , this is not for you","With only 4 fm channels to choose from, this unit does not have the best reception. It works best in the country, away from the crowded fm dial you find in urban areas."
1,I returned it the day i got it!!,"I would recommend this product on only one condition, if you have no clear radio stations playing anywhere near the frequencies that are available on the FM transmitter. The closest station where i live is 88.1, but the 88.7 frequency wouldnt even play the music from my ipod clear. If you are using an iPod i would strongly recommend the iTrip. It is made only for the iPod but it searches for a clear station so you know there wont be static."
2,Interference = bad sound,"I bought this at a Best Buy and returned it before leaving the parking lot! No matter what station I tried to use with this gadget, I had bad interference...unless I held it in my hand! I figure good sound quality shouldn't require that I use my body as an antenna and only drive one-handed. I'm hoping for better luck with the cassette version."
1,POS SUCKS,"I live in the boondocks and still cant get this item to work. It has lots of static, and is not clear at all. The range is more likt 2 inches and no where near the 10 - 30 ft as advertised. Belkin is ripping people of on a product that looks like heaven."
2,Probably better than nothing...,"I would recommend this if you travel a lot, don't like burning mix CDs, and don't mind paying for AAA batteries constantly. Overall, it is very staticy everywhere I go and eats up batteries (especially if you don't remember to shut off your ipod as well as the transmitter when you leave the car), but since I travel a lot, I do use it and hope I'm in a area that gets good reception on one of the 4 stations it lets you choose. If you do get this transmitter, I would recommend getting an ipod car charger as well."
3,Could be better,"This little device works well - most of the time. It seems that any slight little bump knocks the batteries loose, and trying to mess around with that while driving is not a safe or good idea. Also the limitation of 4 frequencies can be hindering when in larger cities."
3,Nothing Special,"Ever since I got an MP3 player i've been looking for a device that lets me hear my music in the car when I visit my sister in Northern NJ. I thought this device was the answer and in a lot of ways it is, but I sacrifice sound quality and sometimes performance. What I like about it is that it's very portable and I can just drop it in my backpack. What I don't is that it really doesn't work the way it claims to. The sound quality is not great, and from time to time you get the radio interrupting your music."
1,Usless is a flattering word,"Terrible. I live in Santiago, Chile and this thing simply does a terrible job, even being at 1 cm. close to my car radio. I even removed the car antenna to avoid interference. No, no way. I lost my money."
1,Don't WASTE your money!,"Sounds like a good idea, but this thing just does not work very well.....it's like listening to an FM station that you ALMOST get...signal goes in and out, while other stations bleed through. I returned mine the day after I bought it!!! Stick with the old-style cassette adapters. Sorry Belkin, you tried!"
1,DONT BUY!!!,-i bought this and it was horrible there are only 4 settings for the frequencys and they all were staticy.-this is not just some fake review.-i recomend going with any of the sound feeder sieres by arkon i got 1 of those and they work a hell of alot better.
2,Not ready for prime time,"As so many of the other reviews posted, I can't say too much more about this other than it works really good on a home stereo system, and only mediocre in a car. In my wife's car, it works pretty good, but in my car, it is constant static and interference. The sound quality is very low; worst than most FM broadcasts. Where I live there are strong radio broadcasts on all four of the frequency settings, so I experience constant static and noise on every setting. It's a good idea, but it doesn't work nearly as well as you're led to believe."
1,Works great...if sub-AM sound is all you want,"I knew this thing couldn't be expected to produce crystal clear reproduction from the source...but I expected it to be listenable. It doesn't matter whether I'm at home or in the car, whether I'm using my .mp3 player, my Palm or even a plain old cassette player as the source...it barely works. You get four channels to try...2 of them are taken here by legit radio stations. The other two cause static...lots of it. I usually feel like I'm driving in the middle of nowhere late at night, trying in vain to find a station that'll stay tuned in.Once or twice, it has actually managed to play with only minor static. Eureka! But then I had to crank up the volume so high that I got distortion.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Absolute junk!!!"
1,Belkin FuzzCast,"I Purchased the Belkin Tunecast FM Transmitter primarily too use my iPod whilst in my car. I would also like too use it in my house as i thought it would be quite convenient not too have too be using a line in all the time.I was very disapointed with the performance of this product, even on it's clearest frequency setting the sound quality was terrible. Moving the unit around resulted in sporadic signal (And this was with the unit less than one foot away from the reciever!)I tried it on 4 different radio recievers, with 2 new set of batteries (One NiMh rechargeable set) and still had the same issues occur.My Area has no transmissions on any of the frequencies that this device uses (88.1,88.3,88.5 & 88.7)This device had loads of potential, but ultimately proved very disapointing. I have yet too try the Belkin TuneCast 2 however.."
2,Good Cool Factor - Bad Execution,"If sound quality is more important than aesthetics, use a casette adapter. Tangled wires and all, at least you'll be able to hear your music without having to force your passenger (or yourself) to hold on to this crappy little device, constantly angling it for optimal reception. It works only where its available bands won't be drowned out by even the faintest radio station. If you live in a city like Los Angeles, where every available band is used, you're out of luck. I'm not returning it because it will come in handy when I rent U-Hauls and such, and my friends, who don't know it sucks, think the looks and concept are pretty cool."
1,Dangerous chemicals ?!,"We were standing in line at major chain store to by this when I noticed the warning on the back of the blister-pack.It said, roughly: The item was made with dangerous chemicals, including lead, which can cause birth defects in unborn children. Wash hands after handling.A hand-held comsumer electronics item, primarily for use in the car, that I'm supposed to wash my hands after handling !?! They couldn't make this without the dangerous chemicals !?!Needless to say we walked away..."
2,"Not for me, try the cassette options instead.....","I purchased this and loved it.....I was using a rental car and it worked fine. I could play all my ipod playlists and music thru the car stereo...however when I got my own car back (Honda Odyssey) it didn't work. Not at all. Shortly after I read a review in Mac User? which reviewed various ipod accessories including two FM radio transmitters and a Sony cassette model.I then tried the Sony (also about $20) and it works great. Your ipod hooks to a dummy cassette with a wire and somehow transmitts everything to your car stereo. This is a big deal for us because our then 2 year old killed off our cd player by sticking coins into it. The dealor tells us it will take 2-300 just to crack open the dash to see if it works again. In any case, we can now play our music in the car and we are all very happy."
3,Minneapolis / St. Paul buyers beware.,"Although this is probably a very good product for most people, it does have one drawback that cannot be bypassed. It can only be set to broadcast on four frequencies: 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, and 88.7. If there is a radio station in your area on one of these frequencies, you can just switch to one of the others.Unfortunately, as the title implies, the Minneapolis / St. Paul Minnesota area has a radio station on ALL FOUR frequencies! This does not mean the product will not work. What it does mean is that no matter what you do, the sound quality is not that good due to the bleed-through of the radio stations.Instead of this product, I recommend getting the Griffin Technology iTrip FM Audio Transmitter for Apple iPods (4013-2Trip) as it can be set for any frequency, so you can pick one without a radio station already on it."
2,Disappointed,"This product does not live up to its billing. The quality of the transmission is terrible. I'm no audiophile, but the background hiss is terrible and using this product in the car only makes the hiss worse."
2,Iffy to Useless,"I gave the TuneCast a generous two stars, because it might be useful if you live/drive through a rural area and use your iPod for audio books rather than music.I live in the Washington, DC metro area, which has no shortage of radio stations on the low end of the FM dial. Consequently, the TuneCast turns out be pretty much useless to me -- it does not work AT ALL in the area where I live. I have used on a few rare occasions out in the county, but even then I found the sound quality to be poor -- about like AM radio."
2,the true is I never use it....,"If you are living in a big city whit lot of FM Station... maybe will not work clear... and the sign lost quality, remenber is a FM sign... not a Digital Sign... If you can, use a cable..."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"The title of this review says it all: an inexpensive product will yield unsatisfying results. This transmitter works, but I would not say that it works well. It has only four station settings, which limits the playability and clarity of the sound (when a radio station uses the same frequency that you are tying to play your iPod on, the sound is scratchy if there is any sound at all) For the price, the transmitter is useful on highways, but not on surface streets."
1,Don't waste your money,The sound quality of this device is a joke. It sounds worst than an AM radio station. Save your money.
3,"Transmits OK, but interference can be an issue","This product works as designed and allows you to listen to other devices through your FM car stereo. FM interference can be an issue and the different frequencies supported by this inexpensive device may not give you the option you need to avoid the interference. Not bad, but not top of the line either. It works is how I would categorize it."
4,it works,"AFter seeing some reviews of this thing here and CNET, I was worried, but the thing does work. There is the occasional static, and the occasional need to switch the transmitter to a different band, but I live in Boston, where the airwaves are hella clogged, and I am still happy with it."
1,Dont buy it,"Don't buy this transmitter! I went to best buy to get my zen xtra (a great mp3 player) and I wanted an fm transmitter. So I went and got the cheapest one. It's cheap for a reason. The signal is weak so you don't get optimal sound on your radio...its fuzzy. When i got it, I was too stupid to realize 5 out of 6 of these were ""previously opened"" which means they were returned. I got one anyway. what a mistake. Anyway im taking it back and getting a different one."
2,Fuzzy Signal,"I tried using this Belkin TuneCast FM Transmitter with my ipod, and it gives me a horrible signal in my area, i live in a suburb of seattle, the channels available for this product are completely open and clear, and still the transmitter sends a bad signal, not only that, but if I move it any farther away from my antenna than the dashboard, it doesn't even work. If your thinking of getting this, I would recommend the Itrip."
4,i like it,I wasnt sure which transmitter to buy so that I could use my ipod in my car. I just bought this one to try it out and I like it. I think it works very well and its easy to use. Some times I get a little bit of static but its not a really big issue. I would recommend this transmitter for the price and quality.
2,Don't use in DFW or other large city,"I bought this for my IPOD mini, It has 4 preset stations. All of which were pretty empty except for static in DFW. I switched them on and got nothing but interference. I had to drive an hour out of the city to get a decent signal.I would buy it for a small city or the countryside.Otherwise....don't get it"
3,Get Tunecast II if you travel.,"This Tunecast works great, no doubt, but if you need more than the preset stations, get the Tunecast II model. Tunecast II performed incredibly well during our last road trip. When a strong station interfered with our entertainment, it was very easy to change frequencies on the Transmitter then change the Radio to match. Not that it matters, but our car's antenna is embedded in the rear windshield.Just say no to any FM transmitter with an analog dial!"
1,"Absolute garbage, do not buy",Do yourself a favor and navigate back away from this product. It should be recalled.- Signal cuts out randomly when the device is more than FIVE FEET away from receiver- Sound quality is worse than what you'd get on AM- It's a scam.
1,Belkin FM Transmitter Doesn't work in Indianapolis,"I've tried to use this device in two vehicles, a 2003 Toyota Corolla and a 2003 Toyota 4Runner. In both vehicles, the fidelity of the music is awful. I've spent hours trying to get it to work properly, but to no avail. I suggest using a cassette adapter or a direct link."
2,Not the best for iPods,"I've used both the Belkin Tunecast and Griffin iTrip, and found that the Tunecast is less powerful with less range. The only advantage is if you want to use it with non-iPod devices to broadcast over set frequencies."
1,Not worth the $15.00 i spent on it,"i bought on of this from Wal-Mart, and i wish i have just saved the money and spent it towards a better car adapter. the batteries die after about 3 or 4 hours (assuming you take them out, if you leave them in, they die overnight) and it's terrible at getting radio reception. when i drive from college to my house i change the radio station on it about 5 times in an hour and a half."
2,Works only with 4 frequncies,This product will work with only four frequencies where most of the places already had FM radio's available at those frequencies. The battery life also not good as it specifies.
2,This item is worthless,Don't buy it for Southern California. In the car this thing is horrible. Rural areas might be better.
4,Belkin F8V367-APL TuneCast Mobile FM Transmitter,This unit works exactly as I expected because I needed it to replace an auto cassette tape adapter with an always-in-the-way 8 feet cord. The Belkin cord is about 5 inches long. One problem though: there is a low volume white noise in the background which can be masked by increasing the volume on the radio. I'm using the unit with a Delphi XM Satellite radio receiver and this combo is superior and cheaper than the connection alternatives offered by Delphi.
1,Does not work in Indianapolis Vehicles,"Does not work in Indianapolis, IN on any of the four frequenciesin vehicle"
1,doesn't work,"Maybe there are too many radio stations where I am, but the Belkin FM Transmitter just didn't work--not on my home stereo, and not on my car stereo. I tried all four stations and got, at best, music with a lot of static."
3,Serviceable and flexible,"Different results in different settings. Works very well in my Suburban, but has to be really close to antennna in Honda Minivan. Works really well at home through multiple walls to main stereo system. Batteries seem to be lasting well. Bought 4 days ago and haven't had to change after consistent use. Nice that it can work with multiple devices since it uses standard stereo jack. You have to crank the volume on the iPod to get good volume on receiving stereo.Pretty expensive at $30. You can buy MP3 players for that much these days..."
2,Crucial Flaws!!!,"This is a good product accept for 1 major flaw. You can only choose between 4 predefined radio frequencies. I live in Sydney, Australia, and have found that of the 4 available frequencies, 3 are local radio stations. The only other frequency is between 2 other radio station frequencies so it is still subject to interferance on a frequent basis. Perhaps next time Belkin might spend more resources on product testing before introducing it to foreign markets."
5,Does the Job,"PRO:Does the Job, Very Cheap, I use it all the time when I am travelling in my parents Car.Con:For your own car try to plug your mp3 player directly into your stereo. Fm by it's nature has a very low quality."
2,"Works well in optimal conditions, but...","If your setup is perfect - ie the transmitter to antenna distance is less than 3-4 ft, there are no interfering radio stations, and the volume on your audio out device (cd player, mp3 player) is at maximum - you get FM radio sound quality. However, as the distance from transmitter to antenna increases or if you're in a region with a lot of interference, static overwhelms this transmitters low output. A lot of times I needed to lower my car's antenna to hear anything at all. Additionally, the power button is not only easy to accidentally turn on, but there is no auto off feature and the ""on"" light is not bright enough to warn that the device is still on. On my last road trip the device was accidentally turned on and the batteries died. I won't be buying replacement batteries for this device."
2,Take your chances,"Although you are able to select from 4 different stations to transmit to, none of them were very clear for me. I guess it just depends on your area."
1,Nice concept,"Good, if you live in the boondocks. Only four options for FM stations means don't live in a metro area and expect to use this device. The signal strength is horrible and interference from other stations next to the desired band will creep in. Buy a digital tuner if you live in a large city."
2,One major design flaw,"This is a way cool toy, delivering my music in great clarity through my car's audio system. However, inexplicably, the unit does not draw power from the car, but is dependant on a single triple A battery, which quickly draws down and degrades the until performance before failing all together. I literally have to replace the battery after just a few hours use, which is nothing, with my drive time often exceeding that on any given day. Buy it, but budget for and keep your glove compartment stocked with triple A's."
2,"It is a mini FM Transmitter, not a Star Trek Communicator!","I recently purchased the Belkin TuneCast Mobile FM Transmitter to add on to my Sony XM Radio module in our cars and at home, because none of my car stereos have a cassette device, and because my XM unit's antenna will not reach from where it enters the house to the stereo units.In most applications the TuneCast Mobile FM Transmitter performs fairly well as long as it has an unobstructed line of site to the reciever. However if you are in a major metro area where you have the 88.X range is loaded with high powered broadcast stations-- forget it. This cute little postage stamp transmitter can't pump enough wattage out to get a decent signal across a bathroom, let alone broadcast a decent signal to other FM Recievers/Radios around your home.For my money I'm going back to CCrane and pick up the CCrane FM Transmitter, that can be set to any open FM frequency and can be run off AC or batteries."
4,Great ! Saved me money using cassette over buying an iPod,"PRO'sPop in the batteries, set the channel on car radio and it works!Extremely simple to use - I have an hour comute 1 way and listen to books on tapes.I used through my home Bose system and it works perfectly. Great to use with iPod or regular hand held cassette player. But for best results with iPod's use the iTrip, you can choose any frequency available from right on the iPod.At least now when I get my free Otis player from Audible.com - I don't have to wear ear buds (not very safe at all!) while driving.ConsBleeding FM stations cause havoc -I drive through mostly rural areas - If you live in the city I can see where ""bleeding"" from FM stations could make the device useless."
1,Great if you're a fan of static,"I was excited to try this out, but disappointed when it played loud static along with the music. If you're going to use your ipod in the car, just get a cassette adapter - the sound will be better and you won't have to replace any batteries."
2,Too Much Static,Even the best of the four pre-set frequencies still had too much static to provide an enjoyable sound. Found out later that a friend had the same problem. I ended up returning the TuneCast to Amazon.
1,Does not work,"It only uses 4 fm stations 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7. We have a station in town on 88.1 so I figured 88.7 should work. It never worked no matter what radio I tried it on. I tried it in the car and in the house. 4 radios in all and it never worked on any of them. All I got was static and if I listened very closely I could hear the ipod faintly. Quickly returned the item."
2,Does the job... However you lose significant quality!,"This idea is a very good one. It works. However, there are only 4 stations that you can transmit to and those stations, depending on where you live might already have a strong signal going out on it. Where I live, in Chicago, it does an average job. However, there are more than noticeable spots of interference in the frequency. It's extremely annoying to have this thing in the car and get good sound for about 5 minutes and then all of a sudden start hearing interference. It's definitely better if you use it in the house next to a stereo system. For the car, plain and simple, it stinks. For home, it does a much better job. The Griffin made Itrip is worse than this, even though it can transmit to any frequency. So if I had to chose between the two, I probably would pick this one."
4,Cute costume,"I received the costume promptly, even though I ordered right before Halloween.I am a size 16-18 and it was big on me. I had to take the side and back seams in, and of course shorten the sleeves, which were way too long. I also sewed bows and bells on it for embellishment. Needless to say, next year I'll just make my costume from scratch. :-)I wore the jester costume all day at work and it was comfortable and I got a lot of attention. All in all, a good buy."
1,What a disappointment!,"I've had an ice cream maker for years and when it needed replacing I purchased the Deni 5101. All seems well until the ice cream starts to thicken (about 6 minutes into it) on the bottom, it stops the paddle from moving and then the canister just stops turning. Maybe the motor is not powerful enough to keep the canister turning to make the ice cream. All I can do with the ""slush"" is put it in the fridge tothicken & harden it somewhat. What a disappointment!!I wasn't smart enough to save the invoice so therefore I can't return it."
5,Wonderful addition to knitting library,"I received my first issue a few weeks ago. There are several patterns in this issue that I will knit, and some maybe's. I buy many knitting magazines in stores, mainly because I want to check them out before I buy. This magazine is a consistant purchase for me, which is why I finally subscribed. (I also enjoy most of Interweave, Vogue Knitting, Rebecca, and Creative Knitting, though I have chosen not to subscribe to them. Usually not enough patterns in them that I would knit.)"
3,Getting better...,"Love the new fashion trend articles. It's getting better, but it's not quite there yet. Could use a bit more professional and interesting graphic design. The patterns could be more useful and unique. Starting to get better. Really liking the new editor! Kudos for him in a major way."
4,Caveat Emptor,"Let's begin by saying there is much to like on this recording. Let's also say that the recording is very, very eclectic. I am a big fan of Torme, a fact which would help anyone who listens or buys this disc. But Torme is the epitome of the White Jazz Singer and this is a musical which should (no racism here) be sung by black artists (with the possible exception of Joe Henderson's largely instrumental Porgy & Bess featuring Sting--yes, Sting--and Chakka Khan.) The narrator on this recording is a big annoyance. It almost comes across as a period piece--but for all these ""cautions"" I find it an engaging & beautiful recording. Unlike some of the reviewers, I found the quality of the disc just fine & ""Bess's"" vocals quite lovely. But give it a listen before you purchase it."
3,Jazz alternative to operatic venue,I was pleasantly surprised by this jazz rendition of the classic opera. The collection fully utilizes the Gershwin synchopation with a snazzy twist.
2,Not a Keeper,"This was highly recommended by a jazz fan and I was ready for a ""jazz"" interpretation of the piece. However, most of the arrangements are too light and Las Vegas lounge-like for the original music. Really the only good parts are when the arrangers and singers stick fairly closely to the original music, only slightly varying the folk/operatic style the composer intended. Mel is OK, although his arrangements are poor. The Bess just butchers her pieces. At best, I find this a novelty item just worth having heard once and then dismissing. Stick to the Todd Duncan version, which is still the best."
3,An Unusual Porgy and Bess,"This should definitely not be anyone's only ""Porgy and Bess."" Get one of the sets with classical singers on it for the opera as Gershwin envisioned it. But this is a fascinating jazz interpretation of the score with mixed blessings -- Russ Garcia's orchestration and the musicians are wonderful. Faye was an unfortunate choice, but the rest of thesingers, especially Torme, are first-rate interpreters. This is not everyone's Porgy and Bess, but a fascinating piece of jazz interpretation."
1,"Bad choice, bad value","I like Mel, and some (not all) of the vocalists interpretations on this CD, and the arrangements are very good. Based on this, I would say that it is worth owning this as perhaps a part of a collection of Porgy & Bess recordings, although certainly not the first or only...However, the narration is so pervasive and so silly, I would say just forget it. I am not sure, but I think this narator is the same guy who used to narate high school education/public service films in the 50's(e.g. ""What should Marry do on her first date"" or the duck and cover films).This CD isn't worth more than 5 bucks as a novelty item."
1,Frances Faye brings this whole session down...,"Frances Faye couldn't sing if her life depended on it, she was a talentless hack. Betlehem should have paired Mel Torme with Chris Connor, who was with Bethlehem at the time. That would have been a match made in heaven. Unfortionately you have to hear Faye's screechy out of key belting vocals through-out the entire recording. Thank God Mel Torme and Betty Roche are on this. Betty Roche would have been more ideal in the part of Bess. Oh well, just go out and buy the Louois Armstrong-Ella Fitzgerald version on verve instead,arranged by Russell Garcia."
2,Awesome,My mom (Patti Moran ) has a new gospel CD you should hear. To hear a sample go to Pattimoranmccoy.com.
3,Gentle but stinky,I like that this product is gentle and made for sensitive skin. It says fragrance free but unfortunately it smells awful. The worst part is that you have to leave it on overnight. This product did help remove the cradle cap flakes but so does Burt's Bees apricot oil. The oil smells great and it only takes 15 minutes and a comb. I love Mustela's newborn cradle cap shampoo but this product just didn't work for our family.
2,Did not work for us,"My daughter didn't really have cradle cap when she was little but at 13 months her scalp was really dry and a bit scaly like cradle cap. After doing some research I decided to try this product. It sounded great, but it really just didn't work for us. Maybe it's because she has some hair now (although probably not as much as she should), but the cream did not make the cradle cap go away. I was better off just rubbing some olive oil on her head when I have her in the bath. I just hate doing that because her hair looks greasy all the time. She still has a bit of a problem, but now it's more just dry skin on her scalp as opposed to cradle cap."
5,should be a classic,"In short this book should be considered a zen classic, im not sure why its been out of print for so long. Its a good mix of Naturalistic(?) writing mied with zen explanations and instructions and a few anecdotes of the great Dainin Katagiri and Shunryu Suzuki. If this book were a little less outwardly and boldly ""zen"" it could probably have alitle more mainstream love but alas we've got a gem hidden in the wide open spaces here"
5,A Great Book Deal,"The book was like new. I have a copy in paperback, it's a great book so I decided to get it in hardcover."
4,Definitly for Amatours and not for heavy use,"StandThe one thing that I did not like about it right away is that there are many plastic parts. So you have to be extra careful not to overtighten anything otherwise it might break. If you extend it to about 6fit the pole bends. It is designed for amateurs. Pros are that it folds easily and is light, but than you have to carry weights anyway, so I do not think that lightweight matters. Next time I think I would buy the stainless steel stand from specialized store.ArmArm is good, although it also has plastic partReflectorReflector works well, it folds as well.Update: after one year (maybe it was used 20 times) two plastic parts broken"
1,Absolute tripe,"This book is written on a fourth grade level, and might be interesting to children of that age. There is nothing new or even mildly interesting in it. A complete waste of money!"
1,Because he wrote them himself?,"To the person who asked why so many reviews are the only review anyone did...plus have some bad spelling...is your point that the author wrote them himself?Is the book about Japan, about libertarian politics espoused by Lew Rockwell, or about the author's self promotion?"
3,"Ok, but wanders someNtimes","This is not a guide to Japan or anything japanese related. It's an OK book, the author has a sometimes acid sense of humour but does a good job explaining his points of views. The only downside on my point of view is that he sometimes is a little too US-centric, even if negatively. But it's an OK, humourous and light book."
2,mixed feelings,"This game is one of the most buggy games i have ever played, the customer service sux, getting accounts created and paid for sux. First time i have ever had to work to get a company to take my moeny for the product. The business end of this company is worthless and needs to go back to school.Having said that this game is also one of the most fun games i have ever played. The players are great the gameplay even with all the bugs and lack of info o nthings is fun and has so much potential. The overall design is brillant.If you can stand the frustration of dealing with the company and bugs that have been there for years you'll find an enjoyable game to play. If i have to deal with thier customer service or mods/admins not answering questions anymore i'll be one step closer to canceling my account.Good luck!"
5,Life Between Lives Hypnotherapy,Dr. Michael Newton's book is very easy to follow. I took his classes and find that all of the information given in this book is the perfect primer for this work.I am going reopening my LBL hypnotherapy practice and will be fact checking my clients experiences with Dr. Newton's descriptions of the many places in the world between.
5,Compelling Truth,"Dr. Newton's books changed my life. His case histories verified again and again that life does indeed exist after a loved one's passing. How comforting. I am so grateful that Michael Newton and another ground breaking physician, Dr. Brian Weiss, through their life work chose to share the techniques that reveal the truth about the after life. WOWZER!"
4,Might not be what you think,"Not as good as his previous two works, but still better than most.With 'Life Between Lives' Michael Newton attempts to spread the methodology of guided LBL trances to the interested. The book carries the topics presented in the first two books further to some small degree, but really the book is about learning to guide LBL sessions as a hypnotherapist."
5,A must read for people who want to know what else is out there,"An incredible third book in the series, allowing even more knowledge to be passed on to us. As a Clinical Hypnotherapist, I was completely enthralled by this book, and am sincerely looking forward to the time when I officially train in Life Between Lives.In the meantime, this book has enabled me to add more questioning to the experience when I see clients in this area, making it a more fulfilling session for them ... and me!Thank you Michael .. well done again!"
2,"A Lumbering, Joyless Tome","As a Clinical Hypnotherapist for over 22 years, I found this book very disappointing. It's dry, devoid of joy or enthusiasm, and I really found quite a few of the techniques described in this book, to be questionable.I bought this book based entirely on the reviews. After reading this book, I find the other reviews surprising.I am a regular Amazon book reviewer and most of my reviews are positive. I'm not someone who slams authors; I have great respect for the dedication it takes to get a book to print. Writing a review that wasn't positive didn't feel very good to me and I considered not writing one at all. But that's not really right either.So, here's my opinion of this book. If you're looking for a high energy, spiritually-uplifting book with a lot of usable technique as I was, I think you'll find this book disappointing."
4,Love this book!,I remember this book many years ago when I first started teaching in a daycare. Now that I am a daycare director and infant teacher I am happy to have rediscovered this book and bought it for myself.
2,Really basic,"This book is really not worth the money. The ""activities"" included are like ""talk to your baby about this object when they look at it."" I was looking for a book that would give me knew ideas beyond obvious things that I'm already doing."
3,Good acting......Good filming......Good low budget film,"If horror isn't your thing forget this movie; if it is, buy it. Some very good acting is done by CLAY ADAMS, whom you may recognize from the T.V. soaps ""As the World Turns"" and ""All my Children"". BRYAN SMITHSON and the supporting cast use their talent to move the plot forward very effectively. The ending, although simple, caught me by suprise. Low budget movies require a greater than average suspension of disbelief, especially since the advent of computer graphics and super special effects. If you haven't got the brain power to sit through a play, then stick to mega movies like Star Wars....they've thought of everything for you, but if you can enjoy a film at face value give this one a shot......I think you'll enjoy it!"
3,BROTHERLY BLOOD,"An indie film obviously with a low budget, BLOODLINE isn't all that bad. While it's not a classic by any means, the movie does throw in some unusual plot twists that will keep the viewer puzzled.A somewhat retarded young man goes on a killing spree and murders a bunch of his brother's friends on a camping trip, and then disappears, only to be taken in by some reclusive stranger. Years later, the brother is having his own nightmarish memories and it's not clear just who is responsible for the deaths.The movie's climactic scenes seem a little contrived, but the psychological implications are chilling even if a little confusing. All in all, not a bad indie horror film."
2,Confusing,"This movie had been recommended to me for its interesting twist ending. Well, if it's there, I don't get it.I have an inkling about what the branching off of plot line may stem from. But if it's what I think it is, there are a lot of lapses in logic that would make the new path unlikely, or actually impossible.Furthermore, the production values for this film are rather cheesy. So unless you want to puzzle out the implications of this particular hatchet-man pursuing yet another set of teens in the woods - you might find a better way to spend your time."
1,Stay away from this movies,"All i can say is wasting my time. i just rent the movies today. at first i thought it will be horror and murder movies, but all i can see is crap. the production is very poor and all the character."
1,Stupid,"The cover art made this movie look like it was going to be along the lines of SAW, the description made the move sound good too. Boy how pictures do decieve, this was the most stupid movie I have seen in awhile. I would watch this again if it was the last movie on Earth..Don't waste your money or time on this one."
1,Error Ridden!,"This short book could not possibly hope to cover the period from the 4th century B.C.- the 10th A.D. Badly researched and full of errors. Examples: The Sea Peoples were the first known people to wear horned helmets, not the Celts. Second, it was Varus' legions who were ambushed in 9A.D., not Valens. Third, does anyone believe the authors claim that a handful of recently defeated German cavalry won Gaul for Julius Caeser? The artwork as with almost all Osprey series books gets a 10 out of 10. The text gets 1."
1,more pretty rubbish,"Beautiful illustrations do not make up for the fact that this is misleading, poorly researched rubbish. Newarks knowledge of costume is minimal at best. He actualy uses Victorian illustrations that were based on nothing but a guess, as the basis for some of the images. If you want a folio of Mcbride illustrations then buy it. If you want good historical reconstructions - forget it."
3,I Bought if for the Pics. Otherwise useless info inside.,"Based on previous reviews, and my appreciation of Angus McBride's skill with paint and brush, I bought this book with a grain of salt.As per his usual, McBride's paintings are breath-taking, powerful and impressive. And THAT is why I bought this book. The material contained herein is not accurate, and there are editing mistakes as well, which further complicates any attempts at reading.IF you like the images of old world warriors and depictions of gore wet battles and heroic deeds, the book is enjoyable for that - thanks to the artist. IF you are looking to learn a truthful and correct history of these people - stay clear of this one.I gave the book three stars based solely on the art work, since that is all I can say I enjoy about it."
4,a great accompanying volume to Imperial Rome at War,"A wonderful book full of great illustrations by Angus McBride and fascinating side stories by Tim Newark. Much in the same vein as the earlier ""Imperial Rome at War"", this book is in a series which hopefully will extend to many different genre's and expand upon the given ones. Although not as good as the Roman one its very good involving exceptional historical detail and great atmospheric scenes from the history of barbarians, the so-called foreigners using a term coined from the Greek. The book covers these ""barbarians"" right from the ancient Celts up to the early middle ages concerning itself with Celtic, Germanic and Slavic tribes as well as Turkic tribes such as the Huns. Great for wargamers, modellers and readers of the fascinating earmarks of history."
3,True life but...,True life story but the acting leaves a lot to be desired...intersting in spite of it's flaws. As usual an excellent buy from Amazon.com.
5,Nick Wilson Hero to two cultures,"This is one of those movies that at a glance you would have to say makes a great story but..... It could never happen that way, But it Did. This is a truly amazing story and its a piece of well documented history. Dont let the history part scare you off because this is not a dry movie. This is the story of Americas first pony express rider ""Nick Wison"" Who had the most unlikely and fantastic adventures as a youth. His actions in his youth would change the course of local history (Utah & Wyomming) before he became The first Pony Expres rider and that would change Americas course. This is great piece of largely forgotten history, but its also a great story about charachter and spirtuality. The photography is wonderful and the DVD transfer is very good.I highly reccomend the book too. This is a great flick for the whole family. Blake Heron Does a really fine job of acting in this movie too."
4,Wind River,Enjoyed the movie and it will be good with the younger children. It has a good story line and I am sharing withfamily.
4,WES STUDI,"good family tale.well acted and of course, based on a true story. Not sure why Karen Allen is mentioned as the star? as any fans of Wes Studi will be only too happy to buy this for a quick ""fix""!"
2,Needs updating,"This book contains some great information on designing E=learning solutions on a limited budget, however a new addition needs an updated release as technology changes quickly."
3,Cheap must also be effective,"This book spends a lot of time saying that this or that can be done for $0. Unfortunately e-learning is not only a function of content. The author gives some excellent examples of inexpensive and memorable e-leaning projects developed at minimum cost but then also includes items which should be called e-reference rather than e-learning. Perhaps, searching a Word or PDF document for a particular term, falls within her preferred definition of e-learning which is ""anything designed to improve work performance delivered by any electronic means"" but so also would threatening emails and abusive telephone calls. Effective e-leaning requires a cocktail of the memorable and the motivational and is unlikely to be just anything. However a lot of good resources and references but just a tad too much on the use of Word, Power Point (and similar) and nothing at all on inexpensive programs like Captivate"
4,The Greatest Poison Album,"With ""Flesh and Blood"", Poison really hit their stride. They brought their passion for blues crashing into the mainstream, with Brett Michaels showing signs of real maturity and ethusiasm on almost every track.Highlights include, first and foremost, the experimental ""Unskinny Bop"", where CC Deville's guitar work and Riki Rocket's drumming both show a ten-fold increase in quality over previous albums, and ""Valley of Lost Souls"", where the whole band's energy is palpable. They take risks with these tracks, and find enormous success. And, both sound incredible on this remastered release! Other highlights include ""Ball and Chain"", ""Flesh and Blood"", ""Poor Boy Blues"" and ""Something to Believe In"". The band takes time to craft intelligence and moments of special interest into both ballads and rock tracks. As a whole, the third album is fun and energetic, but also deeply reflective.Unfortunately, not long after this record, Poison's popularity and creativity began to deteriorate."
1,DEFECTIVE CDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Great CD but the remaster (at least the one I have) has an incomplete Poor Boy Blues. You've been warned.
4,Poison's Last Hurrah,"'Flesh & Blood' by Poison in 1990 is a nice album but it has aged since its original release in 1990. Led by the monster hit 'Something To Believe In' (no doubt WRITTEN to be a media hit), I find there isn't much else to this album. 'Unskinny Bop' was the first single off the album and honestly it's crap. The rest of the album is basically filler for the one mega hit on the CD but if you like late 80s big hair/makeup rock and/or the group Poison you will probably enjoy this album. Totally remastered this CD sounds better then ever. My advice, skip to track 11 and set it to repeat. If you do this, you will not be disappointed.****"
4,an okay book!,"I think that many people may not like this book, for it is basically not a book. It is a guid to the body of a growing girl. His book would be for young, growing girls that would like to know more about their bodies, but they are too embarrassed to ask anyone about things.The best part about this book is that it is in an easy to read form of information. On most or even all of the topics, they are very thorough. I guarntee after ereading this book, every girl will know everything about themselves."
5,THIS BOOK GETS 5 STARS!!!!,I just got this book and i can't put it donw! i LOVE it and i think this would make a really good gife for teenage girls!
5,Very Informative!,"Purchased this for my 12 year old. I am going to wait a short while to give to her, as some material is slightly more explicit than I realized, otherwise, I could sit with her and read or look through for now. Very, very informative & concise. I am glad to see the honesty in the presentation of some very ""hot"" topics."
5,A must read for teens!,"I purchased a copy of this book with the intention of giving it to a friend's teenage daughter. While flipping throught the pages, I was delightedly shocked at all of the topics covered from drugs to dating to mental health. In this age of media, kids have much more to deal with and this guide successfully navigates one through the muddy waters of growing up. Even I learned quite a bit!"
3,Sexually explicit - should not be for young teens,"I ordered this book for my 13 year old daughter because it seemed to cover all pertinent subjects from drugs, std's, body image, etc... When I reviewed the book I was shocked to see that not only did it cover these very important subjects but also went into ""how to"" have sex in explicit detail. This book would have been very informative except I don't think that we need to tell our teens ""how to"" perform sex. This chapter also came before the chapters on protection and consequences!"
5,"a great guide for being a girl, and a gURL","i just got DEAL WITH IT and it is great! not preachy at all, instead of having people stand up on pedestals and say 'THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD LIVE,' it uses real girls' posts from real girls' lives to show you that there's no one way to live your life. it's funny and smart and it doesn't talk down to us, or talk to us in some weird form of english that older people seem to think is 'teenspeak.'"
3,Totally Suprised!,I'm the mother of a 15-year old daughter who was looking for a book that my daughter could read that would relate to the pressures of a teenage girl her age and that would be sufficiently cool enough for her to read. If I gave this book to my dauhger I would have been giving her my permission to have sex with advise on how to have sex. I'm sorry but this book is NOT appropriate for the average 15-year old girl. I would reconsider her reading it at a much later age.
5,juz great,"very helpful.....touches every subject.....ages about 10-16.....moms, dont worry, now u dont have 2 talk....jus buy this n it covaz ne thing u can think of."
2,Condition: NEW----or NOT,"I ordered this book because a friend of mine has it for her daughter. I LOVE this book, I think it is written very well for a teen-age audience and is a great read for all those inquiring minds within this age group. I wanted to give a copy to my niece for her next birthday. The reason I only gave it 2 stars was b/c I ordered the ""New"" version from Amazon and the copy that was sent to me was anything but New: Part of the front cover was torn, the spine was completely broken down, the pages were turned up at the corners and were obviously old and worn. I did however speak with a very helpful Customer Service Representative who is sending me a ""NEW"", New version, so it all ends well. If you have a ""Tween"" or a ""Teen"" or know someone who does, I would highly recommend this book...Where was this when I was a kid?"
3,Some Adult Content,"I am the father of two 14yr old girls and I was shocked at the adult content in this ""teen"" book. I don't believe in hiding things from our teens. I just think there should be a warning label on books with such sexual explicit material, like currently used with music and movies. Parents have a right to be warned about the material their teens will be exposed too. Having said that, I did give the book an average rating because it cover the material in accurate detail and presented the pros and cons of the subject. Teens will find out all about sex, this book could be used as a tool for conversation between parents and teens. It will also tell them the truth about questions they are afraid to ask. We as parents just need a heads up on adult teen material so that we can screen it or further explain it to our teens. Parents read what your kids read!"
5,An amazing perspective,"I am a 14 year old girl, and I just have to say that anyone with any questions should get this book. To the concerned parents: Through this book, I discovered that I was a manic-depressive and got help. Now, if I hadn't read it, I might be dead. Seriously. Also, most teenagers already know this stuff, but have misconceptions- and this eradicates them. It's a wonderful book."
4,Let your teens have this book,"I've seen a couple of reviews about this book being like crap because they talk about sex? Well, sooner or later your kids will know how to do that kind of thing, that's why it;s called 'Deal with it'. It's a reference book concerning teenagers problems, survival, etc. FOR TEENS.Plus they have the right to, and who will buy this book for a very young age? Obviously it's only okay for 13-15 y/o kids but not for 5-10 year olds. I give it 4 stars :) It's a nice reference book!"
5,In tune with today's teens,"Perhaps I am out of context for saying this, having just turned eighteen myself, but those who rant about how horrid this book is need to take a step back and reflect: as it is true of every year that passes, each new generation of teens is faced with pressures, traumas and in general, issues of today. Well written with the reader in mind, this book is an excellent source of up-to-date resources and facts. This book is not just another ""oh I'm growing up, let's take sex ed"" book, but deals with other facts of life, like eating disorders and suicide, drugs, friends and family. Being a teen with close friends affected by things like anorexia, bulimia, and depression, I am very appreciative of a book that will bring reality to life for young women."
1,Unbelievable,I can't believe any responsible parent would buy or allow their daughters to read this. Sexual education about your body should be taught by the parents. CHILDREN should not be having sex or given INSTRUCTIONS and TIPS on how to do it like this book does.DISGUSTING!
1,Candle Wax,"These little tubs seems to contain just regular old candle wax. Nothing false about this as it only proclaims itself to be ""String and deck wax"". So I got out just a cheap old table candle I had and I used that to rub on the deck and string. Candle wax is a little hard but so is this ""excaliber"". At around $7.00 a tub, I think I would use the Barnett stuff which is more expensive but softer and easier to apply. Years ago I used Bees wax on my recurve bows. I think I am going to try that again as it is much cheaper. Using an old candle was very easy as far as application.......these Excaliber tubs are hard and I am not sure how to remove from the tub and apply to your bow? Bees Wax here I come. I do like the Barnett deck wax but it is expensive."
1,stupid and boring,"i got this from the library a year ago last february - just by listening to your reviews - convincing me how 'funny' and 'fun' it was. what a buch of lies. it's not. good thing i canceled my book order in waldenbooks... i didn't finish it, but only got to chapter six."
5,Sweet Heartwarming Story,"I was very pleased with the book as I was recommending it to a friend of mine (15 years old) that has been feeling displaced within her own family. I wanted to show her that even though I'm not related to her, I could still be a part of her family without her having to give up any of her relatives. She is of a different nationality and the story helped her realize as I hoped it would that she does not have to give up anything of her own heritage to be loved by me. It is an easy and fast read and is great for all ages. I was especially touched as I have lost both of my parents and sometimes feel orphaned even at the age of 40."
2,LACKING PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS,"I FEEL THAT COOKBOOKS, ESPECIALLY BAKING BOOKS SHOULD CONTAIN PICTURES AND OR INSTRUCTIONAL ILLUSTRATIONS. THIS BOOK WAS SERIOUSLY LACKING. THERE WAS ONE RECIPE FOR A WEDDING CAKE BUT NO PICTURES OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN ATTEMPT SUCH A BLIND PROJECT?"
5,It Makes a Difference,"I recently received this wonderful book as a gift, and all I can say is how incredibly amazing it is! While I have always thought of myself as a ""nice"" person and have donated money to charities, this book made me realize that there are so many more ways to actually make a difference. Through this little book, I have already learned of many easy and different ways to help make the world a better place. I thank the author for bringing something so obvious to the attention of the world!"
4,A Great Reference Material,"This book is wonderful! It provides a wonderful descriptive veiw of what the great comedian Groucho Marx was like, and amazing stills and photos. And if you read this you might also want to read Groucho and Me also by the master himself Groucho Marx."
3,Groucho speaks...and probably regrets it!,"Take one young interviewer, an aged member of a classic movie comedy team and no one to shut off the tape recorder and you get this book; a rambling,insightful, and in the end, sad book. Groucho comes off as a bitter man who lost his razor wit with age and now spews venom about many who were a part of his life. While there are many insightful interviews with others who are part of the Marx legacy and an excellent collection of memorabilia that take the book up a notch and make it a must for fans of the team; in the end you're left with a Groucho you wish had someone looking out for him and spared him from making these kinds of comments."
3,In Hot Pursuit,"Isabel Garcia makes a disturbing discovery in her yard. Her ex-husband had buried a suitcase full of cocaine in the yard before he died. Isabel calls the officer she had dealt with previously to share this discovery. Linc Heller longs to see Isabel again and wants to get involved with her. After saving her from sexual assault, he starts his campaign. But she is afraid to get involved with a man in such a dangerous line of work, both for herself and for her adorable daughter, Susie. She fights and resists and gives ultimatums. And Linc has his own demons to work through.... The exotic setting, of Isabel's tropical fruit tree groves, as well as the details of tropical fruit growing and police narcotics work make for fascinating reading, as the characters struggle to grow and change."
4,Ellen she ain't.,"Holly Near has written a very entertaining book about her life. She describes how she has gone from being heterosexual to (possibly) gay and back to heterosexual. One such return to being straight caused a lesbian admirer to throwup. She is as perturbed to hear this as we are. But putting a label on Holly Near is not going to be a profitable experience. I just felt that I had met a woman and really seen her heart. I read this book some time ago and I still remember a strong emotion. The book is hard to find and we haven't heard from her. Holly, whatcha up to"
4,Good first diary,"My almost 8 yr old daughter wanted a the Personalized Password journal, but I purchased this one instead. I'm glad I did,especially after reading the Password journal reviews. This journal is easy to customized with any 4 key combination & easy to reset if you forget the combination. While it doesn't have alot of writing space, it really good for younger girls like 8-10 years old. It has a small notepad & storage space, which my daughter enjoys. Her also came with a plush flower speaker that can hook up to any music source (CD player, MP3, etc). The outer cover is removal for cleaning & the speaker is quite. I recommend this journal for younger girls to keep their ""secrets""!"
1,"Cute, but not practical","If you're looking for a diary that REALLY locks, this isn't it. The lock is flimsy and can easily be pried open. Also, if you put it into a backpack, the buttons get pushed and the musical notes play inadvertently."
3,Pretty good but eats a lot of batteries,"I didn't see this in the other reviews, but we are finding that we replace batteries once a week. (!) Plus, there's not much storage space. If you want to write in it every day, that's less than 2 months."
1,Order Password Journal and receive Keep Safe Diary,"We were very disappointed with our purchase of the Password Journal because when the package arrived -- a product did arrive on time -- but it was not what we originally ordered therefore my daughter was very disappointed. In the end, I had to go buy the Password Journal anyway costing me twice as much. This has been the worst internet shopping experience I have had."
2,The book tells your the simple ways to be giving and good.,This book left a lot to be desired on the creative level. It was very logical and predictable. Great Ideas for those who have no clue but for those of us who and looking for something different to spice things up this isn't the book for you.
2,A guide -- but not creative,"I too was a bit disappointed in the lack of creativity in the book since it is supposed to be a guide to ""creative giving."" I did find 2 of the ideas to be creative and plan on using them."
3,Romance is in the Air,"The book is not as creative as The RoMANtic's Guide, but it has a few ideas that are worth implementing. I believe I got my money's worth."
5,A perfect sequel!,"I enjoyed this book even more than The Christmas Shoes. When I finished Christmas Shoes I couldn't help but wonder what happened to Nathan Andrews, the little boy who lost his mother when he was only eight years old. This story picks up many years later when Nathan is in medical school trying to figure out what he will do with his life. He meets a girl and is faced with the possibility of loss again. Nathan has to remember the lessons his mother taught him before she died and remain strong for the woman he loves. This is a very sweet love story perfect for the holidays."
5,The Christmas Blessing is a blessing!,"I really enjoyed The Christmas Shoes. So, of course I wanted to read the sequel. It is somewhat predictable but there are a few twists and turns in the story, here and there, that I didn't see coming. Although a romantic story, it does involve some sadness regarding some of the hospital patients. Therefore, it's not all ""perfect."" It does resemble everyday life for someone who works in a hospital, in my opinion, and I would read it again. And I continue to recommend it and the other books in the series to friends."
5,Beautiful,"Beautifully written story that will have you smiling, laughing, and crying. I highlighted so many things that are wonderful reminders and inspirations. I highly recommend this heartwarming story of God's blessing."
5,Tearjerker...filled with the miracles of Christmas,"I purchased this book along with the Christmas Shoes, thinking it would be a nice gift for one of my children. I had to read them to see if they were as good as I had hoped. I didn't think that the sequel, Christmas Blessing, could possibly be as good as the Christmas Shoes, but I think it was almost better.I cried several different times and had to bury my face in a dishtowel. It touched me deeply because I believe in Christmas miracles too. I would recommend this book to those who are in need of an uplifting Christmas story. It's warm and fuzzy, yet so sad in some places. It makes you think seriously about the miraculous power of love and selflessness.Both books are now MINE. I can't bear to give them away as a gift."
5,The Best,"I just read The Christmas Shoes and The Christmas Blessing. I have read LOTS of books, but these two really top all lists. EVERYONE should read them, even though I had a good cry all the way through. (My husband just died this past February)The cover says ""Christmas Hope series""--are there others to follow?"
2,sappy romantic inspirational fiction,"One of the other readers admitted this is sappy, romantic literature. It is indeed. If you like rather cliched plotlines, phrases, and character developments, then this is for you. But if you want a heart-warming story about a young man coming to grips with love, with his calling, and with his past, (I'm being half-truthful, half-sarcastic) this is for you.Yes, this is a sweet little story. For anyone who reads good literature, it is too predictable and written like a film, not like a book. But if you like sweet little stories, this is for you."
5,Being a Film Student...,"I am a film student in California and I completely identify with this Australian movie. The hilarious and bittersweet moments are well-told by the first-time writer and director and actors, especially Matt Day(Michael), Frances O'Connor(Mia) and Radha Mitchell(Dani). They all did an amazing job with the resources that they had for this independent film. I recommend this to anyone who is living through or have lived through college life."
4,Remember its a first for the director and is very low budget,"Coming from the same place this movie was filmed I thought it tapped perfectly into the university lifestyle of those 20-somethings that experience the joys and pitfalls of share houses, parties, changing majors and changing girlfriends/boyfriends. I think that this movie sure isn't for everyone but its important to remember what each of the characters represent and the emotions they display throughout the film. I admit that the acting is average in stages and the sound is very poor but remember this is a first for Emma-Kate and it was made on an extremely low budget.If your wondering what it would be like to spend a year or two studying in Australia at a university level, then I would surely recommend this movie."
4,Pleased,"I was thrilled to be able to find a copy of this book! This has very sentimental value and I my sons' now love this book as much as my brothers did 20 years ago, thank you!"
3,"Lots of material, but not too well organized.","This is a perfect book for the solitaire fanatic who wants some new challenges. It is not the book for someone who wants to quickly find a solitaire game with a specific flavor, degree of difficulty or age recommendation.The book is one long list of games. The games seem to be organized by similarities in play. A particular game is introduced and then the next few games are modifications thereof. Unfortunately, there is no grouping of games beyond this. No chapters, no synopsis of the games. A look at the first few pages on this site will give you the complete flavor of the book.So if you want to dive in and play them all, this is a great book. Otherwise, it can be frustrating."
2,Find out nothing about being on the moon.,"This book is all about Cernan and nothing about whatit was like to go to the moon. The man is almostcompletely inarticulate, but what he lacks there,he makes up for in ego. You will learn nothing aboutthe wonder of space flight from this book. I'm goingto follow the reviews of others and read the Collinsand Bean books."
3,"""The Wrong Stuff""","An ego centric, poorly written book which is saved by one of the most thrilling adventures of all times. ""The Wrong Stuff"" could have been a subtitle, as it doesn't come close to Tom Wolfe's style on the same subject."
1,"His favorite word seems to be ""damned.""","It is sad to me that a man of Mr. Cernan's age seems not to have matured to the point where he doesn't feel the need to use a swear word in every other sentence to sound macho. It really ruined the reading experience, and despite his going to the moon, I came away feeling he was diminished by his own book. The guy seems too immature for ""hero"" status."
1,Moon Landing=Fake,"I will not believe any book by any astronaut that claims they went to the moon. People, the moon landings were totally Faked.I have concluded that we never went beyond Earths Exosphere."
5,What a ride!,"Eugene Cernan's conversational account of his participation in the Space Program takes the reader on one hell of a ride! His descriptions of blastoff, spacewalks, moonwalks, training, emotional highs and lows places one right in the middle of the action. I found it to be extremely entertaining, and not so techno as to bore the average reader. A definite A+."
5,Best space book ever!,"I have read many books about the space program, and I would rate this one highest. Eugene Cernan focuses on the human aspects rather than the technical aspects of the race for the moon, and it makes for fascinating reading. This terrific book will be enjoyed by anyone interested in space, aviation, history or biography. If you are going to read a book about the history of space flight, in this 30th anniversary year of the first man on the moon, be sure to read this account by the last man on the moon."
5,A very fine book,"I have read a lot of books about the space program and I consider this to be the best I have ever read. Eugene Cernan depicts the horrendous Gemini 9 spacewalk, the Apollo 10 cursing, competition for seats on Gemini and Apollo flights, and the Apollo 17 moonwalk beautifully. As for the reader who gave the book 2 stars, I'd have to say he was being way too critical. Cernan describes the flight of Apollo 17 in a few pages? I believe he describes the mission in chapters 28, 29, and 30-depicting the lunar rover and ALSEP deployment, Jack Schmitt finding orange soil, and his feelings as he left the surface of the moon, among other things. It was a great book."
3,OK,"Cernan had a great life, from flying as a naval aviator to being the last American to walk on the moon. The book is basically a biography of his life, NOT a detailed history of NASA as some may have hoped for. In it however, Cernan does do a good job of explaining the workings of the Gemini and Apollo space programs. The negative side I was disappointed to find he devoted very little of the book to the actual moonwalk he took part on, and he's obviously got a big ego. But hey, he signed the book for me so what am I complaining about? Enjoy the book."
4,"Good overall, but several flaws too","Michael Collins' ""Carrying the Fire"" is still thebest astronaut book I've read. However, I did enjoy this. The goodpoints are: 1. Much of the material is new. For example, His coverage of his Gemini mission is particularly interesting. 2. He is candid. Issues such as crew selection and skill are discussed openly. 3. Overall, the story moves quickly. The bad points: 1. Oddly, the section on his moon flight is among the shortest. 2. I think his ego gets in the way sometimes. 3. He spends time talking about celebrity friends and parties etc, which I had no interest in. 4. They needed a proof-reader. There are many grammar errors. I was annoyed by his overuse, mixing, and repetition of hyperboles and metaphors."
4,A page turner. . .,"I'm an admitted fan of the space program, and was looking for a book to read while on vacation. I picked this one up three times, and put it back twice before finally deciding to buy it because I could find nothing else. I didn't put it down again. Gene Cernan's story is a riveting behind the scenes look at the NASA space race through Apollo, through his eyes. A wonderful journey, and you feel like you're going with him. I'm glad I bought it."
4,"Congress, what have you done?","Gene's book is a fine read, and being a voracious reader of all things space, even I was shocked to read of the danger encountered by the early astros on their Gemini EVAs. It's too bad that he doesn't get very personal with his thoughts -- what was it like to stand on the moon and look back? Maybe it's too difficult to convey in words.But what makes me extremely angry is the way in which Congress and the administrations of LBJ to the present have put manned space exploration on the back burner. The '60's were heady days, we just didn't know it at the time. We now need a leader who can get us back into real exploration. Enough of this orbit-around-the-earth-in-the-boring-shuttle stuff. What a yawner! Get with it Congress -- give us our space program back."
5,a great story well told,"Cernan tells a great story of America's manned space program's early years with candor. However, I have two complaints. First, he over indulges in (and mixes) metaphors & similes, which gets tiresome. Second, some of the grammar is poor (I blame his co-writer and editor more for that). Having said that, I still think it's a terrific book."
4,Aliens Book One,"I was greatly surprised by this book. It is probably the best of the comics, and focuses on the survival of Hicks and Newt. I heard other reviewers say that the comics were better than the last two movies, and I must agree. ... The story focuses on the survivors of the Aliens mission, Hicks and Newt. After their arrival on Earth, they were seperated and unable to communicate with each other. But when an Alien Hiveworld is found the goverment needs Hicks expertise and drag him along. But not before he rescues Newt(who is much older due to the elapsed time spent on earth) and takes her with him. After barely escaping the alien mission, Newt and Hicks realize that the aliens are setting up a bigger hiveworld, a hiveworld on the planet earth."
1,Use it for kindling,"I was planning a dive trip to Catalina and bought this book and then another one by Joe Belanger, called Catalina Island, All You Need To Know. All you need to know is way better and more informative, and has color pictures of the marine life. Save your money and just get All you need to know on a website. There is way too much hype on the Boating Catalina Book."
2,"Not very informative, GPS coordinates WAY OFF!","Book lists info and approx location for 35 shipwrecks, but only gives GPS coordinates for 2 (TWO) of them!!! Of the 9 dive spots I've entered in my computer map (Magellan Mapsend), 4 were off by over a quarter mile (Lava Wall Beach, Seal Point, etc). One dive spot is 600 yards inland. I mean, if the book was free, that would be one thing. But I paid good money for it and now I realize there is no reason to enter any of the coordinates, because there is no way to tell which ones are even close. I just now stopped entering in my GPS program and went to Amazon to write this review. The author should be embarrassed."
3,Sleek and trendy,I have this case already. I like it so much I bought another one as an extra. Works as a case but still shows off the beauty of my phone.
5,A gem waiting to be discovered,"This is simply one of the best CDs to appear in the past decade. Whoever your favorite singer/songwriter -- Bruce Springsteen, Richard Thompson, John Prine -- Lori, on this album, holds her own. She's that good. I saw her open for Shawn Colvin two years ago and went out and bought this disc afterwards. The angry ""Bible Song,"" the gun-shy ""Mr. Sunshine,"" the tender ""One Man"" (a beautiful love song) and ""If You Ask,"" the haunting ""Pour,"" the bittersweet ""Stealing Kisses,"" the brisk ""One Kiss Goodnight"" ... all combine thoughtful lyrics, memorable melodies, and first-rate musicianship. What more can you ask for from a songwriter? Amazon needs to load some samples so more people can discover this gem. Meanwhile, buy it on faith."
3,"Good, but not Lori's best work.","I've been a fan of Lori McKenna for years now. Her album, Paper Wings and Halo, is by far her best work. Bittertown does have some good, haunting music on it, but if you are new to McKenna, then get Paper Wings & Halo before you buy this album."
2,Uneven and disappointing,"I immediately purchase any disc by Emmylou Harris, but this one left me largely disappointed. With the exception of the stunning ""1917,"" these songs did not convey the same emotional power and beauty that I associate with her work. If you are new to Emmylou, get her recent, live Spyboy album instead -- it is a great sampling of her oeuvre with great arrangements and the utterly appealing presence of Buddy Miller on guitar (get his discs too!). And if you want to hear the definitive version of Western Wall, then you must get Roseanne Cash's lovely disc, 10-Song Demo. All of these alternatives are much more worthy of your hard-earned dollars than this uneven collection."
4,Wow!,"These ladies soar and occasionally rock! What voices...yea some of the songs are sluggish...but listen to 'em a few times...they grow on you like a nice mold. Best songs are ""Loving the Highway Man"" especially when the chorus knocks you out of your seat, ""Falling Down""...kind of has a ""grungy"" guitar feel to it..Linda's vocals are best here, ""For A Dancer"", and ""Raise The Dead""...very hummable chorus. These 2 should only work together from now on!"
2,Maybe I don't get it yet.,"I really like Harris and Ronstadt (including the first Trio album more than the second), but after dashing out to buy this album it seems lame and uninspired. Perhaps I have not listened to it enough yet, but no cut grabs me and this has not been true with other Harris and/or Ronstadt albums. Compare Return of the Grevieous Angel, which I think is album of the year."
2,"Close, but no cigar!","Eagerly awaiting for this CD to hit the stores once I heard it was coming, I ran out and bought it the very first day it became available. Gee, I shoulda waited for some reviews! I have loved Linda and Emmylou forever, and tho I think Emmylou's voice is not quite as good as it once was, the SOUND of them on CD is not the problem, it's the choice of material. To my ear there is almost nothing on this compilation that really, really stands out. I like ""1917"" the best, and ""This Is To Mother You"" next. After that it just about all runs together for me. I don't choose music, it actually chooses me-when I get goosebumps listening to a song, or when the combination of lyrics, voice and melody make my heart sing, or my heart hurt (broken hearted melodies, etc.) I KNOW I have spent my money well and will also spend my listening time well. Sadly, that is not the case with this endeaver. Please try again Linda and Emmylou."
4,FROM TRIO TO DUO WELL-DONE,"I just purchased this disc today and have already listened to it no less than five times. I work in a music store, and I swear Emmylou digs up some stuff I haven't ever heard. The album is good on first listen and has gotten better each time. I love it all with tracks 1 and 3 standing out as the high watermarks. This album is as good as the Trio II album, but it is indeed different. The main thing here is Emmylou's voice. If you like it - buy it."
2,"Good, but nothing special","Some good songs: Raising the Dead, For A Dancer, Sweet Spot, Across the border, This is to mother you. But on the whole, not particularly inspired or memorable. If you don't own Emmylou's Wrecking Ball, buy that instead. Or Cowgirl's Prayer. I think they're better off solo. The Trio records are hit and miss as well."
2,It just doesn't work,"I had such high hopes for this CD, plus I'd had to wait ages for its delivery, so when it finally arrived I was well and truely ready to listend to this music. Well what a disappointment it was. Both these women are superb singers, but put them together and their voices just don't blend with each other the way you'd think they should. I've heard Emmylou sing with artists like Patty Griffin and the result was glorious, but her voice just doesn't work with Linda's. I listend to the CD several times in the hope that it might grow on me but unfortunately it didn't."
2,wanted to like it more,"I've loved EH's recent albums, and tend to enjoy a variety of music styles, but I have to agree with those who say this album left them cold. Seeing Linda & Emmylou in concert in SF last week kind of explained it all; Emmylou is magnificent, while Linda is rigid, neurotic and wishing she were elsewhere. I ended up suspecting that Emmylou brought Linda in on this project to cheer her up from whatever major depression she seems to be experiencing, and the result is less than staggering. GO SEE EMMYLOU LIVE, though, if ever you get the chance."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait to get this album, as I am a fan of both. I am sorry to say, this album did not meet my expectations. Although there is no denying their talents as singers, this album left me wanting more. I am going to see them in concert at the end of the month. I hope their concert is better than this album."
4,It does take getting used to.,"Don't expect, like I did, a ""duo"" version of ""Trio"" on this one. It is much closer to the sound of Harris' ""Wrecking Ball"" than to country-folk rock. Yet they are in great form and with intensive listening, the album haunts."
5,Fantastic,"When its at its best music touches our lives in a personal, intimate way. This album did this for me. Though I've never been a real country fan, or had much knowledge of Emmy Lou Harris, I've been a consistent Ronstadt fan and I find her music always out-of-the ordinary and inspiring. There is such a wide variety of styles and themes that there is certainly something for everyone. The music generally induces toe-tapping and singing along even if you didn't intend to. Some of the music hits so close to home its stunning, others less so and one, 51917, is so depressing that I skip through it. I suppose it speaks to somebody, though. All in all its a beautiful work full of harmony and feeling."
1,I should have left this on the shelf.,I was expecting great things from the two artists. I am a fan of both. This recording was not up to either of their standards.
1,"Very poor, certainly not western, not melodic.",What a disappointment by 2 of my favorite singers. There is nothing memorable and nothing resembling western or Mexican flavor. Definitely an album to skip. I hope they will go back to their roots as they could do so much better if they selected beter music.
2,Boring songs with one great singer!,"Linda disappointed me. Most of the songs on this cd are forgettable. She has the best voice in the business, but has been releasing mediocre songs with lousy record producers. Linda has said that she is retired, but before she does, she should give us a powerful album with multiple producers: Nile Rodgers, Jerry Wexler, Barry Beckett, Richard Perry, Brian Ahearn, Tom Catalano, Ron Nevison, and Peter Asher. What an album that would be! Linda, please don't let this be your last pop record. There are still good songs out there!"
4,the album we've been waiting for years,"Finally they made it! and thanks to Emmylou to have made Linda more accessible and open (even to have a new picture!). Here the sound on the most emotional songs (Western Walls...) derives from Emmylou's last influences, but Linda contributes at her best with her incredible voice. The song list of writers is impressive. Emmylou is beautiful and stronger than ever, and some record company should bet on her and try the ""Bonnie Raitt miracle"" of some years ago. She's credible, respectable, cool and hip enough to sing every genre of music old and new. Linda is Linda: she has experimented enough in her career to deserve attention and respect. Her voice is a trademark, and in a moment of great new discoveries of the 70's and 80's she should deserve more space."
2,By-pass this mediocre effort,"I anxiously awaited this c.d. Emmylou's albums of the 90's have all been great. This album is a major disappointment. There are only two or three cuts that would compare to even the worst songs on Emmylou's last four or five releases. The songs aren't bad - they just don't grab you. If you are considering buying this, don't do it unless you have all of Emmylou's albums."
5,Give them the wings to fly through harmony,"It took several listenings before the true impact of this CD sank in. Ronstadt and Harris take turns leading and harmonizing in this wonderful collection.Ronstadt really shines, performing with all of the confidence and power of her early rock days. Her pitch is still perfect and her performance superb.Harris holds her own, her slightly country reading not interfering. Both women harmonize beautifully when not leading.The women seem to have something to say in the choice of cuts, from Harris' lead in the musically understated but lyrically intense ""1917"" to Ronstadt's magnificent lead on Sinead O'connor's incredibly powerful and touching ""This is to Mother You"".In the event that Linda and Emmy Lou ever read the reviews... thank you."
3,Across the border.,"I'm very fond of both Harris and Ronstadt but I prefer on an album that the same mood is kept all the way. For instance, the new album ""Essence"" with Lucinda Williams - though varied songs - nevertheless keeps the same mood and spirit all the way. On this CD the tempo is too uneven. When I listen to the album, I always skip the first 3 songs. ""Loving the highway man"" is much too loudly produced and the song ""For a Dancer"" is way much better in the original version with Jackson Brown. ""Western wall""-""1917""-""Sisters of Mercy""- ""This is to mother you""-""All I left behind"" and ""Across the border"" are all pure gold sung with angel voices and harmonies. The other songs should have been replaced as they disturb the unity, mood and balance. The two wonderful women have undoubtably tried to make the album varied - but unfortunately, it doesn`t work here!"
2,Uneven production,"There are some great songs on this CD, such as Jackson Browne's For a Dancer, but the production is very uneven. In the opening track, Linda Ronstadt is singing along and all of the sudden we are blasted with some heavy-handed, hi volume harmonies. A similar misstep occurs in For a Dancer, but fortunately, doesn't ruin an otherwise great arrangement. The song Sweet Spot (co-written by Emmylou) is just one bad cliche after another. Disappointing."
5,Good Lord!,"I bought this album because a magazine I review for asked me to do a column on it (yes, I gotta buy the C.D.s). I had NO interest in this album. I brought it home. I put it on. My eyebrows raised, my heart melted. This IS the album of the year, a truly creative and stirring project of rare beauty and resonance. And SO intelligent. It proves great music is still being made."
2,"Considering the personnel, it's a bit disappointing.","To tell the truth, I bought this disk because of Emmylou Harris. I've been a fan since she backed up Gram Parsons in the '70s. What has always attracted me to her music is the simplicity of her arrangements (e.g. ""Satan's Jewel Crown""with only guitar, dobro, and John Starling's backup vocal). As a rule, she lets the song speak for itself. Her gorgeous voice is the perfect vehicle for songs like ""Ballad of a Runaway Horse"", ""Icy Blue Heart"", and ""Easy From Now On."" Sometimes, though, production values tend to weight her music down, as in the album ""Bluebird"". After two terrific ""Trio"" disks, I was eager to hear ""Western Wall."" I was disappointed to hear a disconnected and ponderously-arranged collection that lacked Emmylou's usual soulfulness and sincerity. Emmylou and Linda Ronstadt were both in excellent voice on the disk, but the selection of songs and the wooden arrangements keep it at two stars."
1,The urge to create this should have been overcome,"I am an EmmyLou Harris fan and bought the CD on that basis only. It has none of the sparkle that I long for from EmmyLou and Linda Ronstad also should have stayed home. While there are a lot more critical comments that could be offered, it is enough to say that this opus is best forgotton by both artists"
5,"Sensitive, Useful, Wonderful Book",This is the book I wished I had when my children were first born. I love the sensitive way she describes memorable activities. A must for new parents!!
1,Chew toy,I got this for my puppy and he tore it up in 1 houre.it's soft rubber. he war about to eat it.
1,Lasted less than 5 minutes,"The packaging warns to not give this to adult dogs or puppies with adult teeth, and that you need to replace it when pieces larger than a grain of rice break off.Our puppy isn't even 4 months yet, so this ""puppy teething bone"" sounded like the perfect fit. No adult teeth. Before we even got home from the pet store, pieces larger than a grain of rice were breaking off from the ends.Don't bother."
5,Good Chew,Both my dogs love this. My teacup poodle is only 6 mths old and making a dent in one after chewing on it for hours. The larger Cock-a-poo is 4 yrs old and only occationally chews on hers but does like it.
1,Do not give this to your pup!,"Do not buy this, it makes the puppies vomit. They chew off pieces of it and it makes them sick. The pieces harden in the dogs stomach and form a clump.If you love your pup do not buy this its dangerous."
3,HE LIKES IT BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE!,"ITS KINDA RUBBERY... NOT SURE IF IT ACTUALLY HAS FLAVOR... IT SMELLS LIKE IT WOULD... BUT WHO KNOWS... HE CHEWED IT FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS... LEAVES... THEN COMES BACK... CHESTER MATEO IS A 11 WEEK OLD LABRADOR PUPPY... REALLY INTO BITTING... I'M TRYING TO GET AS MANY ""GOOD"" TOYS AS I CAN FOR HIM.... HE KEEPS BITING MEEE!!!! UGH"
1,Lasts forever!,Yes this bone has lasted far longer than any of the other chew toys and bones i have given my dog. I owe that to one specific reason: she shows absolutely no interest in it whatsoever.
5,Pugs Love it,"I have three pugs. All three love this Nylabone puppybone. The other nylabone products are too rigid, and the dogs ignore them. This particular bone/chew is soft and rubber-y. They nibble off the ends, and small pieces do come off, but mostly very small, like the size of grains of rice, or a small pea. I think every dog is different. But for my pugs, these work great! Better this than the edges of my wooden ottoman. I recommend starting your puppy off on this."
5,Must have,"This is the only thing that got rid of my super bad cracked heels, I have really dry skin and I work outside in Michigan in winter. Thank you Burt's Bees!"
2,BOOK NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT.. IT WAS MY ERROR AND NOT YOURS.. IT WAS TOO YOUNG FOR THE PERSON I WAS GIVING IT TO.. THANKS WAYNE MCCRANE
5,Fantastic Piece of Pop,"Great Bones Howe production from the core of Brasil 66'. Fits nicely between Sergio Mendes and Fifth Dimensiongreat vocals and arangements. Great version of Trade Martin's ""Take Me For A Little While"". Would of love to have heard a second helping!"
4,"Solid Case, Works Well - film at eleven","I had accumulated a few watches and needed somewhere safe to store them. This case has worked out well. The only thing that is strange is there is a lock and key (largely for show), but when locked it doesn't lock the drawer. A bit odd but I don't need a locking case so it's no big deal to me. (and I lied, there is no film.)"
2,Bad buy,"Yes it will hold you watches, but the pouch on the inside has 1 necklace of mine and the interior is stripping off. Ive only had it for 1 week. I would not recommend this product."
4,The Perfect Gift!,"I bought this watch box for my husband as a father's day gift from our twin toddlers as a both a keepsake gift and a practical gift since he has so many watches - and he loved it. We were both very impressed with the quality of the wood, the fabric inside, and even how sturdy the box is. The pouch is a great bonus feature for holding links or booklets. I didn't expect it to be quite so nice for the price. I highly recommend it!"
4,A good buy,Overall I love the watch box. The wood reminds me of the old days. It has a very rich look. I was disappointed about the lock. It only locks the top portion of the box and not the bottom portion. I thought that was odd. I hope in the near future they correct that error because what is the purpose of a lock if you can't lock it in its entirety.
5,watch chest,This item was given as a gift. It seems to be quite adequate for the intended purpose.It should be fine as a dresser top item but lacks a means of securing the bottom drawer.
1,No lo recomiendo.,"Fue necesario para mi leer Mi Mama Me Ama, pues la profesora de Espanol calificaria mi conocimiento sobre dicho libro. Me encanta leer, pero el libro no es ni un poco interesante. Es persistente en la critica a el pueblo de Puerto Rico lo cual no fue de mi agrado y la prosa no posee nada en especial. Lo comence a leer y se me hizo tremendamente dificil continuar con la lectura, es aburrido de principio a fin, aunque no puedo negar que en alguno momento de locura se me escapo alguna risa que otra."
1,Do not buy this from forestry supply company,"Forestry supply company at first sent me an empty box and when I called to notify them of the problem they told me UPS must have lost the product. The only problem is that the box was in great shape and didn't look like it had been opened. In the end I received a refund but I really needed the product which they claimed was discontinued and as such they couldn't send it out to me. I could however still place an order through their website for it so it didn't seem like it was discontinued. It seems like this company might just send out empty boxes claiming that they sent the product and hopes to make money by having customers not complain.In order to get the company to respond I had to posted negative feedback for the company. However, I don't like how you cannot follow up a post after the a company has a chance to post a reply to the feedback because in the reply the company flat out lied."
4,Its got a lot great songs,"I think its a pretty good cd, but i think the best song is can i get a.... by Jay-Z."
1,Not the same?,"Another reviewer had said it was not the same color. I didn't see how this could be, so ordered it. It is Pepto Pink and too thin even with a couple of coats?This has been a favorite color for me at salons and has a slight purple hue to it. But not the bottle I purchased??"
3,I still love Prez,"I am a huge Lester Young fan but I found Lester's solos on this album disappointing. From his very first note you can tell he just does'nt have much left in the tank. Although he did come through with a few flashes on his solo work on ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" and ""Salute To Benny"", he does not have the same command of his horn as he did in his earlier years. He sounded weak and winded. He appears to have the ideas in his head but he can't tranlate them into his horn. However, the backup work of Roy Eldridge and ""Sweets"" Edison make this CD worthwhile. This CD does not change my opinion of ""Prez"". He's still the greatest."
5,magnificent performences of two masterpieces,this is one of the best pathetiqes on disc its one of the most underrated and romeo and juliet is very well played also the tragity the pathos all conveyed very well.
5,husky tale,"Kazan: Father of Baree (Medallion Editions for Young Readers)This is a fantastic tale of a dog coming to trust a man, and a man coming to trust his dog. Do not want to give to much away, for me it beats White Fang and Kazan in its story telling, and I should know I own a independent Husky dog myself sorry Mr London and Mr Curwood, you books are great but North Runner is better.My only complaint is it is hard to get hold of a good copy at a reasonable price, and why oh why as this book not been republished!If you love Huskies like I do, or fantastic tales about dogs and the wilderness get a copy!"
1,Where does Vitamin C get her hair dye,"Where does Vitamin C get her hair dye, It's a great color. To bad her music is so dumb. I wish she was cool like Sugar Ray or Britney."
1,"""friends forever"" WHATEVER!","this album sucks! NO MATTER how many times you play it,it will evenautally get to the point to were you DO NOT want to listen to it again! as for the songs on it the ONLY ones i like are ""smile"" an uplifting song,""me,myself and i"" a good dance song. but one song on this album should have NEVER been recorded! that song is ""friends forever"" i mean come on GET REAL once you graduate you will NEVER be friends forever with whomever you were friends with in hs or college get over it! you will NEVER see them again either! the message in that song is pathetic i mean come now do you EVER have a chance of doing what it said in the song? not likely because in certain places they will have do so much stuff you won't have a CHANCE to say something to them! skip the album ALL TOGETHER! just buy the ""smile"" single it will SPARE you from the rest of this crappy album!"
1,Vitaman C Your goin nowhere,"Hi I purchased this years ago... back when I was in the 8th grade... i'm 19 now I just want to say that this cd is seriously one of the WORST cd's I own and I completely regret buying it it is a waste of money... practically all the songs on the CD have the same beat the only thing that changes is the lyrics yeah ok there is a few songs I like on here ""Graduation"" ,""Aniversery"" and that ""I Got You song"" which is a remake I personally like the original better. If 3 good songs is worth it to you then you can order it but you have been warned. SO ALL in all I think this cd is awful and you should check out Jessica Simpson or Mandy Moore, Britney Spears, Christina Augulara (the 2nd album) etc.. etc... Just don't waste your money on this it is so awful!"
2,Smile you haven't bought this CD yet!,"Smile!Dont buy this CD you are wasting your money!The only good songs are Graduation and Smile, so just buy the singles(it saves you 4 buck at least)"
3,Pretty good for a debut.,"I only really liked two songs on this CD: ""Smile"" and ""Graduation"". ""Smile"" is a very catchy, uptempo song where the chorus can get stuck in your head forever. ""Graduation"" is a great song that should be played at all High school/College Graduations. Vitamin C has a great voice but needs to widen a little with the variety of songs she chooses for her CDs. And she needs to pick some better songs, as well. Great attempt for her first album, though. Not the usual Pop-sound you might hear on basically ever other Pop album. So I recommend it if you really like Vitamin C's music. But if you only like some of her songs, by the singles instead."
3,"I like C, but this CD isn't the best...","I like Vitamin C and I really think she's talented, but for the most part, this CD is really annoying. I like 'Not that Kind of Girl', 'Me, Myself, and I', and 'Graduation'. Don't waste your time or money on this CD!"
2,Lady Saw should clearly get the credit here.,"I first heard 'Smile' on the local pop radio station's show of pre-released singles. I thought it was cool, mainly because of the dancehall vocals done by VP records recording artist Lady Saw. Saw has put out some great albums over the years and really helped spice up the otherwise bland Vitamin C album."
1,Vitamin C Ain't Good For You!,"That squeeky voice, the annoying music, it's just another dumb teen pop idol trying to make millions of dollars, don't buy it. It's such a waste!"
5,"Finally, A CD That Actually Puts You In A Good Mood!!","My entire review can be summed up like this. This is not a deep philosophical album that is supposed to send you into deep thought or influence any of your BIG life decisions, BUT what it can do is REALLY cheer you up. It's catchy, it's fun, and (personally) I can listen to it a number of times and not be tired of it. Let's face it...every now and then we NEED an album that's NOT telling us how horrible the world is, or trying to make some kind of preachy statement. Honestly, the only statement this album made to me was to cheer up and have some fun, and I think that's something we all need to hear now and again. GREAT CD!!!"
1,Music Poisoning,"f you have any reservations about Smile's than don't get this record. This is one bad record. Vitamin C equals Spice Girls minus talent. If you stick to Vitamin C in food and you will live a long healthy life, if you buy this record you may die of music poisoning."
4,Pop with teeth,"This ex-punker (Eve's Plum) may have gone pop and stopped yelling, but her musical talent makes this chameleon of an artist worth listening to, and buying. Not all great, but worth the buy."
3,"Has some strong points, but it's not a particularly great album","Vitamin C (born Colleen Fitzpatrick on 7-20-72 in Old Bridge, New Jersey) already had a handful of musical credits under her belt when she decided to start making solo albums. Though not without some saving graces, this really cannot be considered a pinnacle of success, either. There are some fierce, funky beats that expose the influence that pop royalty like Madonna and Blondie have here, and though she does have a bit of a headstrong attitude in some songs, she keeps the album mostly PG-rated. Unfortunately, she's not the most gifted vocalist around, and she occasionally dabbles in guest rappers and samples.Here's an added footnote for trivia buffs: Did you know that she was the depressed female singer at the Blue Note Cafe in the movie ""The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell Of Fear?"""
3,Just Another Girl Singer,"Vitamin C in my opinion is just another one of those girly singers. Just like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, etc. They get popular really fast and then die down a year or two later. Pretty much then they've become ""just another group"" and people will move on. However I do like some songs in this album which bump on my system. Others are just boring ones like Graduation. I mean get over it man! Once you graduated you won't be friends forever with whoever you were with. Move on!"
2,best song,"April,17 2000 I'm kenson from New-Jersey.I want to say Friends forever from album vitamin C is one of the best song I have ever heard before. For the first time I heard it,it makes me think about my graduation day. I believe everyone love this song mostly graduate students from high school and college.I want to say to you people that you did a great job with your new album."
1,Beginners Music,This album blows. The only reason I listened to it was because somebody stuck a picture of the album cover on my freezer door at some party for all my roommates to laugh at. Only once you've experienced bands outside the pop spectrum does the full potential of this art become apparent.
5,It is the best song! It makes me have a good time every time,Awesome! The Best! The Greatest! My favorite song! It is sooooooooooooooo Good! I mean sooooooooooooo Great!
4,Vitamin C is not a teeny-bopper!,This album is no Madonna but has great hooks - Gradutation is dead on - this is no teen age popster - Vitamin C has a history in other bands - those of you who think Britany is the bomb wouldn't understand real music anyway
4,Blows me away,"What really throws me about this record is how smart it is. Alng with really catchy melodies - like on I got You, it also has lots of cool refrences, like the Clash on Fear of Flying and Santana on Me Myself and I. Kudos to Vitamin C for daring to be different."
5,"Vitamin C puts a ""Smile"" on my face!","It's not everyday that one gets to enjoy something that actually makes you feel happy and alive [like I find that artists/bands like Harry Connick,Jr, Sugar Ray or Len do for me and some others] the way that Vitamin C aspires to doing. The first time I heard her first single ""Smile"" when I was down needless to say it picked me right up indeed. Months later I heard Me,Myself,and I and enjoyed it for its hipness. Well anyway just last month I got the album and loved it except I wasn't as keen on Vitamin C's third 2 part single Graduation Day(Friends Forever) It's just too misty for me. But besides the aforementioned singles I enjoyed ""Do What You Want To Do"", ""Unhappy Anniversary"", and ""About Last Night"" just to name a few. My only hope is that Vitamin C will soon have a new album out and with some of this one's magnitude!"
3,In my eyes,"I think this cd is great if you like that love stuff. One of the songs has a cuss word in it. But when I come to think of it how many songs can you name of rock that don't have any love or cuss words? One song doesn't make sense but other than that, it's got a lot of great songs. Number 12 (Graduation) is probably the best song on the cd other than Smile, and Me, Myself and I. And now that I think of it, in my personal opinion, number 10 is sorta boring because I'm just not ready for that stuff yet. Maybe this would be an good or even great song for teenagers or 20 year olds. Oh, number 11 (Fear Of Flying) has the cuss world in it. But other than that if your a parent and you don't want your kid to listen to all that ""worldly"" stuff, maybe you should reconsider. But I like the way she sounds and what she sing, it's ok, but does ANYBODY no her real name?"
3,"Ok.Good voice,bad cd!","I really found Vitamin C's voice amazing,but she needs some different tunes.Some songs were good.I liked SMILE and GRADUATION(FRIENDS FOREVER).I thought GIRLS AGAINST BOYS was really funny!All in all,Vitamin C needs a new song writer!!!!"
4,Everyone needs some Vitamin C,"This is the perfect CD for when you're trying to get pepped up about something. All of the songs are so peppy that you can't help but feel happy. My favorite song is the first track, Smile, because that's what it makes me do. (corny, I know...) All of the songs are good though. There are some that aren't as good, but in general they're worth spending the money on. My favorites are: Smile, Turn Me On, I Got You, Money, and Graduation. Buy this CD! You won't regret it."
2,WRONG MESSAGE!!,"This CD is one of the worst ever produced. Every song is all about sex and explicitly describes things which couldn't even be posted here. She tries to make up being so vulger by throwing in one of the stupidest songs of all time ""Girls against Boys"" but it just seems desperate and obvious to me. Vitamin C uses a certain ""B"" word in one of the last songs and all the songs have the same techno-pop sound which becomes annoying very quickly. I like the songs ""Smile"" and ""Graduation"" but her non-hits super stink and sends the wrong message to girls. (Not to mention her voice is completely lousy, so they try to make it up with digital sound effects-ugh!) Don't buy this piece-o-junk if you like her hits, it will quickly change your opinion of her and her music."
5,Awesome CD,"This CD rocks. It's much better than Brittney Spears (Yuk) and Christina Agulara (ew). The songs are fun (Smile) and funny (girls against boys) and just good to listen to if you don't feel like ""Bubblegum Music"" (Graduation). So buy this CD already or else you're missing some of the best music."
3,It's Not A Bad Album But It Isn't That Great Eighter,"Vitamin C has an average voice, but some of her songs are lame such as Do What You Want To Do, and Fear Of Flying. Her good songs include Smile, track #2, 3, and 5. Overall, she isn't that special."
2,It's Not What I Thought It Would Be,"At first, I was excited to get this CD. When I popped it into my CD player, I had different thoughts. The only songs that I liked were ""Smile"" and ""Graduation (Friends Forever)"". ""Money"" was okay, too, but the lyrics state that money is everything (""No hundred dollar bills - no fun for you""), which is not true. Whatever happened to love, friendship, and caring? At least near the end there's ""I wish it was love.."" Some lyrics are true, too (""Those with the dollar are those with the power""). ""Girls Against Boys"" is, to put it politely, weird. The lyrics are unintelligible, and it's hard (for me, at least) to put up with the music. ""Fear of Flying"" is disappointing. Half of the song isn't sung, just narrated. ""I Got You"" is decent -- I like the cello (Susie Katayama). My conclusion is don't buy this CD unless you're into this kind of music."
1,poor colleen,I loved Eve's Plumb and I can't believe Ms. Fitzpatrick has lowered herself to this level. She's too old to be doing a young pop thing and it's not even good pop. Ms F. AKA Vitamin C needs to get it back together and do something that isn't embarrassing
4,Graduation,"The only song on this CD that I've heard is Graduation. My grade is graduating from our school this year, and one of the girls passed it around the bus on a school trip to Virginia. It got everybody crying, and the best part is the chorus:As our lives changeWe rememberAll the times weLaughed togetherAs we go onCome whateverWe will still beFriends forever."
4,Come on get HAPPY!,"I love catchy, hook driven rock, from the Beatles to Devo & ""gasp"", yes even Britney! So Vitamin C was right up my alley. Lots O' fun, It's the perfect tonic to help take the edge off a bad day. The melodies will grab you instantly! Yes, ""Smile"" & ""Graduation"" R great but my favorite song is ""NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL"", with it's steady rock beat. So if you're feeling blue take some ""C"" & get happy!"
1,"have no idea, have not heard or seen anything of it",i ordered this and have not heard anything from the company or see any thing in the mail. Not to happy about it at the moment.
4,butterflies,"I paint, and I like to paint realistically. I bought this poster to get accurate illistrations of the butterflies and their size. I am very happy with the product. I wish it had come in book form though so I can get the individual picture closer to my painting."
5,The best of the D. Who series,I have been a fan of Dr. Who for quite a few years. I have seen all of the episodes available and this is what I consider the best
5,Some of Tom Baker's best. My favorite is State of Decay,Definitely worth the price! Three DVDs for what you'd normally pay for one in the store. Any serious Doctor Who collector must have these stories!
4,Doctor Who Fan,"I liked this series. There was a brief skip in the middle of Full Circle (Episode 3), but I cleaned the disc and it was fine."
1,Dissatisfied,At this time I have yet to receive this item. It is now 5 days after I was to receive it. Will not be buying anything from this seller again
1,Avoid,Bottom line: The battery lasted approximately 4 months of very light use. Won't take or hold a charge. Won't purchase their products again.
3,solid for the price...,"you can find batteried for a little less, but the lenmar have always treated me well and not given any firmware nagging like some other generics can. does not have the full 1500mAh Capacity, more like 1200, but still decent."
1,Bad Battery,"Well, I got this battery and was so happy when my camera started right up! I was not so happy when, after using the camera one time, and then after about six weeks went to use it again, it was DEAD! My bad, you get what you pay for. Stay away from imposters."
5,Very Nice Cookie Sheet,I highly recommend this cookie sheet. It is made of heavy gauge steel and has a high quality non stick coating which allows the cookies to slide off of the sheet without using a spatula to remove them. I also like the grip on the upturned edge which makes the sheet easier to handle and the fact that it has the sheet size stamped into the handle.
2,Only plays mp3 files...,"This product only plays mp3 files, it doesn't play wma files at all. The hardware player works fine and the choice of volume types is diverse. It allows you to switch from the player to games, calucator, dictionary modes with no problems. However, I would suggest to some buyers beware, it is not what they believe it to be from the packaging. I learned the hard way but at least where I got it from wasn't the advertised price online. I got from Office Depot in person on sale for under $49.99. So, it is not too bad but they could done better for such high profilic company."
3,limited definitions,"This dictionary has a high number of words, but the definitions are very limited--often only four or five words."
1,Bad Product or Bad Company?,"I purchased this item as a portable dictionary so i dont have to bring my Dictionary Book everywhere.Guess what i am back to Book.....!!This dictionary did not have all the words i would say 85% of the time it gave me meaning. I think this ratio should be higher.Games are alright, you will get bored soon as it will start repeting the same words.MP3 is ok but too slow, also the dictionary overall is slower too.Battery life is great, i never had to change battery.Screen contras is good but quality is pathetic.My screen started detireoting over period of time, it started missing vertical lines and exactly at a Year and a Half it lost most of the vertical lines. Cant read anymore.Since it is out of warranty no one will help, not even for responsible recycling.I would rather spend money in a book than this one."
3,great for the money,"I have an electronic dictionary and I wanted to give my sister one as a gift. For the price, this dictionary is excellent. I was disappointed that there were a few, odd words that were in my electronic dictionary that did not appear in hers. However, mine was much more expensive; so, for the price, it was a great purchase. If you don't own an electronic dictionary, it is a great first one to have!"
4,This is a good kit,"When I got this kit about 2 months ago, I wasn't sure where to go with it. I have to say that I am new to practicing the craft, but I did one of the spells in this kit and it really worked. The spells are so simple to do and the ingredients you need to do the spells are easily accesible. I would recommend this kit to anyone who is just starting out.Blessed be!"
2,"Pretty, but...","I got the lupine collar and leash for my new aussie pup. While the collar and leash was quite pretty, it was not a very usable for us as the collar was too hard and the leash clasp pushed in which made my thumb get in the way when trying to put the leash on the puppy. I tried getting a thinner collar, but the puppy still didn't like it and kept on scratching at it. I finally wound up getting at PetSmart a Top Paw buckle collar and leash with a clasp that pulled down which allowed easier attachment to collar. The collar was much softer and my puppy has taken to it easily."
5,Wonderful Product,"I always purchase Lupine collars, for our dogs. They have a lifetime guarantee and you do NOT have to hold on to a ton of paperwork to take advantage of it.One of our collars wore out, after several years, and all I had to do was call the company and return the worn collar to the company, and they sent me a replacement VERY quickly.Aside from the guarantee, these collars come in a HUGE variety of patterns, sizes and types. So there is a pattern and type to please almost everyone. Lupine also makes matching leashes and harnesses. So you can purchase a 'matching set' if you want to.I HIGHLY recommend this product.Lupine 3/4"" Earth Day 13-22 Adjustable Dog Collar"
4,dog collar review,collar is sized appropriately however the fabric is quite stiff. Ordered large enough sizes for my little dogs so it isn't a problem but be aware that material is stiff enough not to bend.
5,"Gorgeous, sturdy collar!","This collar has vibrant, fun colors and patterns, much more than the picture gives credit for. It seems to be very sturdy and should last a long time. The best part is that this is technically the last collar I'll have to buy since Lupine has an extremely generous lifetime guarantee, even if my puppy chews it. They also have matching leashes and harnesses so your dog will look super cute. I'm quite happy with the purchase so far."
4,Size just right,"Very durable material. Have use for years and still in good shape. It just got worn and faded from many washings.The 20"" diameter size is hard to find in a one inch collar-most go to around 26"" or more which results in a double layer of material which I don't like. The leash is 6 ft long which also is a foot longer than most leashes you find in the discount stores."
3,Not bad.,Very cute designs to chose from. not the softest things in the world though.. No complaints but I won't buy again.
5,Fantastic collar! Durable and beautiful!,"I went to a lupine collar because of their lifetime guarantee (if it gets destroyed, for ANY reason, just send it back for replacement). One of our dogs is learning not to chew on her sister-dog's collar. After 3 destroyed collars, i went to lupine. The collars are gorgeous - bright colors and so well made!! One reviewer said it wasn't ""soft,"" well, no ... if you are looking for a soft/flimsy collar, this is not it. But it seems very smooth and comfortable. Fortunately, our dog-chewing collar problem seems resolved, but I will stick with these collars just because they are so well made and stand-out-pretty for the price."
5,Looks great. Nice price.,"I purchased 4 of these in different colors and styles for my dogs. They look really nice and the quality is good. The clip on this feels more solid and secure than their old collars. The label says these are ""guaranteed for life (even if chewed)"". Sounds good to me!"
3,Misrepresented,"I ordered this collar and made sure that it was not listed as a ""containment collar"". You will not receive the collar pictured you will receive a containment collar. They sent me a collar with holes in it and no ring (so his leash will not attach). The holes are to attach an electric fence zapper. I do not have an electric fence so I had to return it.**I gave it three stars because I have a lupine collar for my dog and love it. He chewed it once and they replaced it no questions asked. I"
4,Rowdy Girls collar,"I got this collar for my 1 year old Boxer. The purple is a beautiful bright collar and looks great on her. The clasp is solid and the nylon feels very strong. She is a small boxer and this size barely fit her, it was almost too big. Its adjusted to the smallest it can go and fits perfect. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price and shipping costs. It came in a box that seemed totally unnecessary. It seemed like it could have been put in an enevelope and shipped alot cheaper. Then I would have given it a 5 star rating."
3,Beware of factual errors,"While this book is fun for movie trivia fans, a reader has to wonder how much fact-checking was done. In addition to a number of typos, MOVIE AWARDS also claims that Cecil B. DeMille was in charge of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Count Your Blessings"" won the Oscar as best song of 1954. (""Three Coins in the Fountain"" won.)A number of other equally careless errors that should have been caught prior to publication make MOVIE AWARDS unreliable as a reference."
4,This book accomplishes what its title claims,"This is a good little book. By little I mean that it's actually a pocket book, which is nice because I can bring it along on the airplane with me. Its advice is helpful and one thing I liked is that the reason for each bit of advice is explained. That is to say, it explained how fear attacks me in an airplane and tells me what to do about it. My only complaint is that the book requires you to do some work up front, which means it's not much help if you plan to fly on the same day you buy it! After reading the book and doing what it recommends, I'd have to say that I can now fly without massive fear. I can't say I love flying, but maybe one day I'll get there. All in all, this book has had a positive impact on me."
1,Men's Exeter Slipper-Not a Great Christmas Gift,"This item appears great in the ad. Unfortunately, it does not wear well. The insoles came out after the first week and have now started to fray around the edges after less than a month of use. I would have returned them, but my husband decided to keep them with the knowledge they wouldn't last very long."
3,"Silver, not black. 2000mAh","For the price I think this is an OK deal. Not bad, not great. I use this battery with a Phase One P25 digital back on a Hasselblad V series camera without any problems, though the battery life is embarrassingly short. For a full day of shooting in the field I think it would take 5 or 6 of these batteries, maybe more. It does seem to charge quickly. The battery is 2000mAh. It is not black, it is tan and silver."
4,Enjoyable If Not Original,My partner and I had a good time watching this. It had some definite laugh-out loud moments and having the opportunity to watch any form of homophobic redemption is good for the soul. Worth a Netflix rental.
3,Under Dogs Triumph,"It was a good story line as far as I could tell. The story focused on the people and their quest to play soccer/foot ball, rather then the fact that they were gay. That was just the setting in which the drama played out. It is nice to see a movie where the protagonist is gay, and it treats him as a regular person, not some sterotyped characher of a person. There were no gratuitous sex scenes,because it wasn't about that anyway. If there was an English language vertion I would watch it again. I had a hard time keeping up with reading the subtitles."
2,dated view of gays & lesbians,Film was made less than 10 years ago yet feltdated . Stereotypes of gays and lesbians wereexcessive. Story was simple not in a good way.
3,Harmless Fun,"Take ""Bend it Like Beckham"" and substitute the young girls for an all-gay ( almost) men's soccer team. Nothing particularly original here--with a most predictable ending. Guess who wins the soccer game between this all-gay team and the very homophobic former team of the lead character? But it is by no means a disaster. The gay stereotypes are all over the place, but this movie never really intended to say anything particularly important. So if you want a sport's comedy with a focus, of sorts, on the gay community--this is it. But don't expect to learn very much or to see the interaction of characters with any sort of depth to them."
5,Great fun & a quick read,"What a fun book! My 9 year old finished half of it yesterday and on a whim I snuck into his room and read it this morning with my coffee. Hilarious! Definitely a great boy book, but should be enjoyed by girls,too. Parents can read this out loud to reluctant readers and will enjoy it as much as their children (I know I did!). Thank you Mr. Colfer."
3,The legand of spud murphy,"Good book for children aged about 10 years old, grandson was reading it so thought I'd read it aswell to see what kids read now"
5,Funny/sad story of an insomniac hypotist.,"One of the best novels of recent years. Bell's story of aninsomniac hypotist is by turns funny, scary, perplexing,intriquing, and almost any other adjective that inspiresinterest. All of Bell's fiction ranks among the best beingwritten today, but Dr. Sleep and Waiting for the End of theWorld are especially rich examples of his earlier work."
2,Hello...is there a story in here somewhere?,"I purchased this because I read about a movie being made based on it. Allegedly, it was all about an American hypnotherapist helping Scotland Yard with a serial killer case. Well, that part of the book takes up about ten pages. I know some people enjoy reading just for the words -- sort of like poetry. And there's no doubting that these are good words. However, if you're looking for a story, look elsewhere."
2,A seriously substandard title,"This book lacks substance, lacks detail and is merely an exercise in self-promotion. If you want to learn to daytrade professionally, get ""The Undergroundtrader.com Guide to Electronic Trading""...Wolff's book is nearly as crass as his online chatroom, which suggests buying against the trend, in violation of the primary rule of trading: ""Trade with the Trend""... there are many better daytrading titles on Amazon.com."
1,Only if you want chat about trading,"The book is really like a chat, it doesn't bring anything deep. It almost don't bring any chart or any new technical analysis, and even their system suggestion is week. For instance, when they explain how to use volume to pick a stock, they even doesn't show a volume chart.What makes the book more frustating is the way it's written, one may feels that it's missing something or the author is hidden something. Moreover they put some stupid dialogs to ilustrate some situations...The book really lacks substance!Thus, buy this book only if you want waste your money and doesn't have anything better to read."
1,I wish I could return this book and get my money back,"Half through the book I realized what a bad investment I had made. I bought the book looking for something more advanced than the hundreds of introductory books on trading, but with great disappointment, because it is 274 pages of NOTHING!."
2,Home Repair,"If Ken can't figure out that his dumper strategy is best sold short in a bear market, then I have no faith that his bull market guruship can last into 2002, and the outdated methods in this book prove it. Aside from a few useful comments about tape reading, I'd put the book under the broken table leg to hold it up and give it one star."
1,It's garbage,"I too have traded in the author's room and was sorely disappointed. I watched him lose money hand over fist for over two months. In the end, he (and his stupid daughter) were following my lead rather than the other way around."
5,He's still awesome!,"This CD is a heartfelt ballad to his fiancee. There are alot of good slow songs, and a few fast ones. However, they all give alot of meaning to the word love. Thanks Brian, for making your best CD yet!"
2,Bryan Can Do MUCH Better!,"I've been a die-hard fan of Bryan's for about four years,but ""How Lucky I Am"" is the first (and only,hopefully) album that has not lived up to the high expectations that I have of Bryan's music. I thought that the majority of the songs were pretty lame and lacked depth and soul.With the exception of ""Two In A Million"" and ""Everywhere I Turn"",I can easily let my copy collect dust. Bryan can do better and he knows it! Bryan needs to go back to playing COUNTRY music...not that sell-out, country-flavored pop thats run so rampant on country radio nowadays!Will the REAL Bryan please come back!"
1,HORRIBLE,"This talentless pretty boy is one of the worst things to happen to country music. Indeed, to call him country is a joke. His voice is lousy, his songs are stupid, and I just wish he would vanish."
1,Unbelievable,"At first listen, I thought that this was Celine Dion. I kept waiting to hear Bryan start singing in French. I'm sure that this sounds great to all those heinous little creatures that enjoy Shania, Kenny Chesney, or the Backstreet Boys. I won't even get into how this isn't country. This is barely even music. I have to spit to get the bad taste out of my mouth. The only solace I can find is in hearing Robbie Fulks."
1,OH SO BAD,This is one of the worst CDs I've ever heard. I enjoyed Bryan White's previous work but something obviously went wrong here....maybe he was badly advised or something. There is not one good song on here. Not a one!! Its a shame too because his other albums are great!!
4,Bryan Soars...........Again!,"Bryan: You have clearly shown your integrity as a man and musical artist on this beautiful recording. Your remarkable first tenor voice ascends into the stratosphere, as we soar with you to the Gates of Heaven. You have truly sung from your heart and soul to us as you tell us what you feel. You and your artistry have grown so much! Thanks.Fans: You're Still Beautiful to Me is wondrous. Bryan sweetly, gently, and soulfully sings of the love that we see and celebrate in each other. There are other great songs that you MUST hear: God Gave Me You, Two In a Million, How Lucky I Am, and You'll Always Be Loved by Me. I won't spoil it for you: Listen! Honestly, there are a few songs on this CD that I don't like, yet I enjoy Bryan's beautiful voice and the great Nashville sound. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED BRYAN?,"Bryan White's first three CDs were awesome! I don't know what went wrong here but obviously something did; he lost his record contract after this release and fizzled out. It is such a shame because he is really a nice boy with talent that was amazing on his first three CDs. The material here is absolutely vapid and dull. ""How Lucky I Am"" was, unfortunately, NOT a good luck charm for White. Nothing on this CD could top ""Someone Else's Star, Rebecca Lynn, That's Another Song, I'm Not Supposed to Love You Anymore, So Much for Pretending, Look at Me Now, The Right Place, or any of the cuts from his previous work. I just keep wondering what went wrong?? Bryan White is certainly capable of better offerings than this. I hope another label gives him another chance to show what he can really do to make up for the ""embarrassment"" this effort was. I just keep asking myself, ""what happened, Bryan""?"
5,Awesome cookies!,"I sent these to my best friend in Vegas for her birthday, and she said they were delicious! Very chewy and soft, she highly recommended them!"
5,Great,These cookies taste great. I share these with those that I work in the office with and everyone loves them. They all wanted to know where did I buy them. They are great at office settings.I really was shocked that the cookies turned out delicious.
4,A Houdini Documentary with a Twist!,"If you love Houdini then you will love this video. It was made with a pculiar style that takes a little getting used to. Once you take your eyes off of the Band/Circus leader that does the narration throughout, you will certainly be entertained with all of their information they provide. Ruth Brandon does an interview and she puts her ""twist"" into the story about the possibility of Houdini's impotence. How she knows this one never knows."
4,"Sad, angry, thoughtful, creepy and j.o.y.-ful,","This album is all of that and more. Jenny Owen Youngs writes a mean lyric, has a coolly deceptive voice - it lulls you in and then wham! Hits you over the head like a pop song baseball bat. Love it. ""Voice on Tape"" and ""F**K, I Was"" are just awesome. RIYL Cat Power, Mary Lou Lord, Beth Orton."
5,EXCELLENT CD FROM A GREAT SINGER/ SONGWRITER,"Honestly, I had not heard of Jenny until I found out she would be warming up for Vienna Teng at the Palace Of Fine Arts in San Francisco a couple of days ago. I listened to a few cuts on the web and it grabbed me quickly, so I bought the CD a few weeks before the show. I listened to the CD in my bedroom at least a half-dozen times and loved every single listen. At the show, she was every bit as good as on the CD, and with a great sense of humor. If you like the female singer/songwriter genre, I highly recommend this CD, and am actually listening to it again as I am typing this. And, should you have the opportunity to see her live, I highly recommend you take it. You won' be disappointed."
1,I just didn't get it,"If you don't mind a thin toneless voice whining about about how ""love grows on me like a tumor"" or her emoting about how ""f**ked was I,"" then you may like this pretentious and delusional suicidal drivel; otherwise I recommend that you stay far, far away... This is like the absolute worst of the Liz Phair-genre of music that I've ever heard. ""Batten the Hatches""??? What does that even mean???"
3,See potential in the main character but wasn't overly enthused with this first in the series,"An interesting book with likeable, believable characters. Mainly whodunit with a side of romance. The first in a new series featuring Liam Campbell, Alaska State Trooper."
2,Just not for me,I generally finish books that I start. I got a quarter of the way through this one and called it quits. The author is way too wordy. It seemed like I was reading forever and not much was happening. Just not for me.
3,Fire and Ice - just okay,"The book was just okay. Throughout, I kept thinking (as others have) that Liam is similar in character to Jack in Eureka which is probably why I kept reading. Wyn is more annoying than intriguing. Taking risks that endangers lives isn't an appealing quality in her or anyone's character. The overly descriptive sexual content was tiresome and added absolutely nothing to the storyline. The characters exercising self control would be refreshing. There really wasn't anything in the book that made me wishing for more so it is unlikely that I would read additional books in a series. Would I recommend it? Probably not."
4,Liam Campbell,"I love Kate Shugak, but Liam Campbell is actually a more human, more flawed character. The setting is fun- what it takes to survive in rural Alaska for the native population and the incomers, who becomes or remains Alaskan- and the mystery is nicely complicated. I'm really looking forward to reading the Shugak/Campbell book."
4,Love men in uniform,Lots of twist and turns keeps you guessing. Writer makes his characters in the book real that makes this a good read.
4,Enjoyable series,"I've read all the books in the Liam Campbell series and have enjoyed them all. Liam is a likable guy as well as his love interest, bush pilot, Wy and the romance in here is well done along with a solid mystery. Most of the negativity directed at the series has to do with the romance in the series and if you don't mind that aspect of it then I don't see why this series would disappoint. The series is left undone though but it isn't that bad. If you enjoy Julia Spencer-Fleming's work then you would (I think) enjoy this series as well. I like Dana Stabenow's sense of humor and her characters are well fleshed out. Give her a try and plus, this first book is free. No risk, no foul."
1,Waste of time,"Ponderously slow and laborious. If you're not familiar with and/or attracted to the historical time frame and/or the social and geographic location, this is a drag."
2,Not my favorite character,"Just finished reading Fire and Ice. I don't think that I'll read any more of this series. I love Kate Shugak but Liam Campbell is not to bright and a bit of a slime-bag. I base this on how he treated his wife and his mistress. I bought this because I am about to read the latest Kate story and Liam is included in that. I thought that it would be nice to know something about him but unless he improves over the course of his series (and I'll never know because I'm not going to read any more of them) then he isn't worth knowing. Stabenow should include the Shaman character in more books, he was very interesting and worth getting to know better."
3,More romance than mystery,"This is the story of Liam Campbell a state trooper who suffers a personal tragedy and is also demoted in his work. He is reposted to Newenham and literally steps off the plane and into a murder investigation. At the scene is Wy Chouinard, a pilot and the woman who he had loved and left previously. The mystery theme of the book was weak and the author really didn't spend a lot of time developing it. The majority of the book was spent on the rekindling romance between Wy and Liam.I did enjoy reading about Alaska but I feel that the book pales when you compare it to the Nathan Active series, which I had read last year and really enjoyed. I felt this book was more a romantic suspense than a solid mystery."
4,Book,"I was very pleased with the book I got to read on my Droid Cell Phone. I was not only a good book, but was very easy to read on Kindle for Droid. I will be gettin another book when I have read some of the ones I have purchased.BA"
3,Fire without any Heat,"I read this because I like mystery books. there are a few graphic sections that are not required nor wanted. Overall its an okay read, but light on plot. Its like a lot of books where a character just jumps up and says I did it and then that's the end. Would be nice for a little more reasoning to be spelled out as to the whys of the events."
4,Familiar with Stabenow,I have read several of this writer's books and found this new character to be interesting also. I would read the next book.
2,Just OK,"The author needs to decide what kind of book to write, romance, mystery, travel? I have another book by this author with a different main character which I'll go ahead and read I hopefully it will be better."
3,Alaska through a troopers eyes,This is a good book about the life of a state trooper. A good mystery with the background of Alaska.
3,In the Middle on This One,"If it were possible, I'd make this a three and a half instead of a three. I won't tell you about what happens in the book; several others have already done this. I had similar feelings as others; I was afraid Liam Campbell couldn't come up to Kate's level. Contrary to most of those, he doesn't do it for me, at least in this one book. It was a good book, it just didn't get me as thoroughly involved as the Kate books do. I loved that we again get characters who are individuals. I am going to read the other Liam Campbell books because I expect them to be better than the average mysteries, and I hope these characters grow on me and become real people as the characters in the Kate books do. Dana does have a special ability to write interesting books! I don't know how she manages to keep so many individual characters going in both of these series without copying characteristics from one series to the next."
4,Good read,"The storyline was very good and the author kept the pace up. I was a bit disappointed how a few description of the ""area "" was a bit too long as if using it as a filler. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery."
5,Fire And Ie,"IT'S NOT JUST THIS BOOK THAT I HAVE READ, BUT I BELIEVE I HAVE READ ALL OF HER BOOKS. TO ME THEY ARE CAPTIVATING AND FULL OF FUN AND ALSO VERY ON POINT. I HAVE A SON IN ALASKA AND HAVE VISITED MANY TIMES, SO I REGONIZE THE PLACES AND STREETS NOT ONLY IN ANCHORAGE, BUT TURN AGAIN ARMS AND THE GOATS ON THE ROCKS NEXT TO THE ROAD.I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER WRITING AND WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING (UNTIL SHE KILLS SOMEONE - LIKE JACK). BUT NOW SHE COMES UP WITH ANOTHER WONDERFUL PERSON WITH LIAM. IT'S TOO BAD WHEN READERS DON'T GET TO KNOW HER SUBJECTS AS THEY ARE TRULY WONDERFUL. I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR EACH NEW BOOK. GOOD GOING DANA!!! YOU ARE TRULY ONE OF A KIND!!!RUTH"
2,Dull and Tedious,Looked interesting but proved dull and tedious. Characters boring and lifeless. Story line very slow. I guess her other books were more interesting but this character is not.
4,Columbo With a Twist,"Haven't finished the book yet, however find it more interesting than I thought. Reminds me of the old Colombo TV series, with a few intertwined love stories too boot. When a new twist develops in the story line I find myself going back a few pages, or a chapter or two to reread and try to figure out what Liam is trying to disclose. Very close to an old series I use to enjoy reading about Dr. Hegelian and trying to unravel the clues before they are disclosed at the end of each story in full detail. Look forward to the next book in the series. Love that raven..."
3,Engaging Crime Novel,I enjoyed the book it held my attention. It had engaging characters and a good story. There were some slow parts with fish spotting but overall I enjoyed it. I will read the next installment.
3,It was ok,It was an ok book. Nothing special liked the main character. Went kind of slow hard to get into it
3,Profanity,Just too much. Every page was full. I could have enjoyed the story if the profanity had been omitted. Iprobably will not read the others.
3,Fire and Ice,I have not finished the book. It was okay. I found another book at the library and will probably finish it later.
2,"A Paler Copy of the Shugak Novels......... Reviewer: Thriller Lover, N.Y.C.","I've read most of Stabenow's Kate Shugak novels, but never had any desire to read any of her other series, at least not until I got to know Jim Chopin. I like him, so I thought maybe I would like Liam Campbell as well. The big problem - Liam is basically Kate, in drag. He thinks like her, he speaks like her, and he solves his mystery the same way she would have. He even has the same way with people that she has, and the same relationship problems in his personal life. I would have liked this novel if I had never read any of Stabenow's books before, but Liam doesn't stack up next to Kate. I had the uneasy feeling as I was reading that all of this was faintly familiar, only a little skewed. Since Stabenow hasn't written a Liam novel after ' Better To Rest' in 2002, I'm assuming she came to the same conclusion. I'll stick to Kate from now on."
2,"""Bleh"" sums it up","I read the other negative reviews before starting this book and found that many bemoaned the ""romance-novel"" bent of this particular book by Stabenow. Well, I love mysteries and enjoy a good romance, so I thought this book would be perfect. WRONG! A good romance novelist knows that what is left to the reader's imagination creates the truly juicy moments. Not Stabenow. She jumps right in with a woman ""grabbing his c--k."" She succeeds in wringing out any romance and leaving only the paltry, crass coupling of an affair. In addition to this scene (which is truly difficult to get over), Liam is hardly a likable character. A married man cheating on his wife who is in a coma is hardly a sympathetic character. To be fair, as the novel progresses, details come to light that make him more likable. However, I never bought in and spent the book trying just to finish it instead of enjoying it. Stick to Stabenow's other series."
1,Reads like a trashy Romance novel,"Did not care for this book, page 48 and already a pornographic sex descripition. I will not read the reminder of this book, the main Character is a idiot. Not well written if you like Romance novels this is the Book for you. Loved the Kate Shugak series."
3,Fire and Ice,"The book hit the ground running with action. It gave an excellent insight to the Alaskan geography, inhabitants and infrastructure. I found the main character, Trooper Liam Campbell to remind me of Dudley Dooright on more than one occasion. I look forward to reading the sequel, So Sure Of Death. I would like to get to know the main characters better.Also, I found the writer's style a little difficult to get used to and found myself rereading sentences to glean the meaning. All in all a good book."
4,Humor And Mystery,"Stabenow just keeps getting better and better. Like some of the other reviewers, I thought I was going to miss Kate Sugak but it didn't happen. Liam Campbell is my new favorite character. With her trademark humor, Stabenow weaves another good mystery. I'm looking forward to more stories with trooper Campbell and other colorful characters Ms. Stabenow invents."
4,Fire and Ice,loved this book. I enjoy these interesting and amusing as well as exciting twistand turns of the characters. Great read
4,Harley,Well written book. Enjoyed the characters in the book it had just enough mystery to keep me interested. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes light mystery.
3,potential,"It's definitely got lots of character you'd expect in rural Alaska, and it certainly gets the mystery started in a very dramatic way. The romance aspect though is a bit heavy handed and distracting."
4,Lee from Lake Macquarie,The ending was totally unexpected!!! An enjoyable easy to read story that I found I was called back towith every spare 5 mins.
3,Doesn't compare to Kate Shugak books,"I thought I would love this series as I love the Kate Shugak series but Liam Campbell is just plain unlikeable. I just didn't care for his personality nor did I like his love interest, Wy. The cheating on my wife because we shouldn't have married in the first place rationale of Liam, incidentally, was silly also. I really wanted to like this series. I won't read any others."
3,Just okay,"Was not a page turning finish in one night book, was in fact boring and unbelievable at times. Unlike others my problems aren't with the affair.The I'm too busy to take a few minutes (and that's all it would have taken) to get a hotel room so I'll tough it out on the floor of my office instead bit was lame and does the author really want us to think he only had one uniform & couldn't find an iron. Both of these details are trivial but are examples of the authors misses at character development.And the got what he gave ending......PLEASE give me a break!"
3,Fire and Ice By Dana Stabenow,I liked Fire and Ice by Dana Stabenow. I like a good who done it. I liked the setting; I have spent time in the far north and I enjoyed reading a story about it. I feel that Dana Stabenow could have used less gutter language.
4,Good read,"Suspense, murder, romance, mystery, harsh realities, love complexity and more. Will read more in the series. That's all I have to say."
4,A good read,"Interesting plot, realistic interesting characters. Good enough to make me buy the next one in the series.If you like a bit of mystery you'll like this book"
4,Good read,I liked the book a lot hard to get into at first but then you get entangled in the story and mystery. Liked it a lot.
5,Fire and Ice,Wow! Absolutely loved Liam and Wy. I can't wait to read #2Great plot and the scene descriptions were incredible.
1,"Complete waste of paper, time, and money","As a engineering student at Virginia Tech, I was very disappointed in this text which was supposed to be ""next generation"" chemistry for engineers. The book is full of errors, some of which are posted on Dr. Glanville's (the author and my professor) website (http://www.chemistry.vt.edu/chem-dept/glanville/Boofile.pdf). There are many more errors that were pointed out during the semester by students, but for some reason not yet part of the ""boofile.""The text is more qualitative than quantitative in nature and has left me feeling like I have wasted my time and money on it. No university professor in his or her right mind would adopt this text. There is also a site http://www.ratevtteachers.com from which you can do a search on 'Glanville' to see what other students think or thought of his text."
4,"Good, product","I am satisfied with th purchase, the charge last more than the original Sony battery and cost a half."
5,"Awesome battery life, awesome price","Simply put, this battery provides great battery life at an amazing price point. It is just as good as the original Sony battery, if not better. On a full charge I get 2.5 hours of battery life. Using it on a Sony Handycam DCR-TRV33."
5,I know the techniques work from personal experience,"The author of this book also happens to be my speech therapist. I suspect he's been using these treatments on me, and they've been working. To the snake oil guy: if there is any bias in this book, it is towards effectiveness. Unlike mentalistic psychology (believe me, we've had endless arguments about mentalism vs. behavioralism), Dr. Hegde tries to use the scientific method to approach any number of communicative disorders. The treatments are based in the scientific method, and are, by definition, verifiable, repeatable, and emperical. No mentalism here!"
3,Expected much more,"Yes it's a Pocket's Guide but it could be a bit more thorough,complete and with more examples.I really got sick and tired of reading ""see Hegde's PocketGuide to Assessment in Speech Language Pathology"" or "" see ""Hegde's PocketGuide to Communication Disorders"" and so forth.This book really can't stand on it's own."
2,"IMHO, not very helpful","Maybe it's just me, but this book wasn't very helpful. I just graduated with my masters and referred to it a couple of times throughout my practicum experiences hoping each time the book would be different, but it never really helped me figure anything out."
5,Great Book!,Great treatment book for SLP!! Highly recommended (as well as the assessment guide too).
5,Great Strings,I bought these strings to try out because of Gibson's reputation for quality products. I was amazed at how much better these strings sounded than my last $3 special. I usually have to change strings every month(I play alot of banjo) but I have had these on for a month and a half and they still sound great. They also stayed tuned quite well. I have only had to tune it a couple times. You cannot find a better product at this price. It is not worth it to buy cheap strings more frequently. Buy these and you will not be dissapointed. Happy pickin'
5,Interesting Adirondacks Collection of Stories,"Enjoyed the tales told in the dialect of the people from the Adirondacks in upstate New York.Ruth WillerthConsulting Editor of the ""Knife of Truth"" series"
3,Hard Times,"First of all a warning: if you're thinking about buying this album because you reckon The Man Who Sold The World is a great song, forget it. Unlike its predecessor, Space Oddity, this is a rock album (of the hard variety). Bowie, apparently, had little interest in this album once the songs were written and it ended up essentially being guitarist Mick Ronson's album... and don't it show!However, some of the songs are excellent - Width Of A Circle (whose motif Primal Scream ripped off years later), All The Madmen and the title track are superb songs and Bowie's voice goes into histrionics throughout (particularly in Supermen - probably the weirdest and scariest vocal performance ever committed to vinyl). And After All was probably written after smoking a pound of hash... a song so mellow it nearly isn't there.All in all, not a bad album, but probably more for fans than the casual listener."
4,"Hard-rocking, underestimated early Bowie...","Post Space Oddity, pre-Ziggy, this undervalued album sits between those two classics of the Bowie canon. But its a startlingly good, consistent record. Fans of the late Mick Ronson will be pleased to find that he never let it rip on the guitar on any Bowie studio album more than this one. And Bowie's songs and characters are particurarly demented. A must-have for fans of the early, 'hummable' David Bowie..."
5,"make that 500000000 stars, punk rock not heavy metal","Bowies most explosive album is not ziggy stardust!!!!!!!!! Its The Man Who Sold the World, people!!! Stotty, trashy, quirky, everything that a rock record should be. I've never heard anything quite like it. Way more than just than ""Bowie's heavy metal album"" as some people refer to it. This album helped inspire a generation of punk rockers to come. Take a listen, you won't be let down."
4,Finding your way,"The revisionist reviews are interesting, because hindsight and lack of context colour and distort people's perception. There is a line between this imperfect very early hard rock album, diamond dogs, and inside/outside. Do you figure that tin machine was always bowie trying to get back to being a man who sold the world? He should have known it was one time and one place. All the madmen was a teenagers anthem, but this is not classic bowie, it is an evolutionary stage. The greatest thing about the carbon-copy Nirvana cover is that it serves to introduce teenage neophytes to this album - and they dig it. Kurt Cobain an improvement? Get a life - or get Lulu's cover version."
5,"i'll give u back my car, give u back my house, give u back my right 2b free!","Those are the lyrics for Lightning Frightening, one of the 'bonus' cuts on the 1990 Ryko reissue of DB's classic album, released originally in the states in the early 70s. It is sacrilege that these cool azz reissues are no longer availiable anywhere. Best songs here are : the title track, She Shook Me Cold, Width Of A Circle, Running Gun Blues. Another killer bonus cut is Hang On To Yourself issued by Bowie under the name Arnold Corns. The Ryko reissue of tmwstw is particularly worth tracking down, then again, if you come across any of the Ryko issued Bowie cd's from the 90's , I strongly advise that u snatch them right up because they have bonus cuts no longer availiable in the subsequent current edition."
5,David Bowie at his best,"One of the greatest rock albums ever. From one great song to another great song this work of art is relentless. What's amazing is that you could remove this album from Bowie's discography and he'd still be one of the greatest rock stars that ever graced our ears. When I first got this, years ago, I had to make myself stop listening to it because it was getting absurd how relentlessly it was getting air time. If you want your rock sensibilities blown open then this is a good candidate."
5,Core Requirement for any collection.,You can hear so many other artists have taken from this album. It is a must have for any collector.
3,The Hard Sell,"For 1970's The Man Who Sold The World, David Bowie adopted a harder rock edge to his music. Guitarist Mick Ronson laid down the biting guitar riffs and Mr. Bowie supplies some his most assertive vocals. The title track is a classic, with its searing guitar and downcast beat. Other strong songs include ""The Width Of A Circle"", ""Running Gun Blues"" and ""The Superman"". The album as a whole is decent, but Mr. Bowie would really hit his stride on his next release."
3,Just a comment,"It is completely incorrect to say that Bowie started progressive rock. I haven't even heard this album yet, but I saw someone state that this was the album that led to others by King Crimson and Yes. That statement couldn't be more wrong. Crimson had already become famous and sere appearing in America before this album was even in conception.That is all."
2,Tending to title track,"2 1/2Another overblown release in my ears. I understand Bowie kicks off an apparently esteemed, extended creative streak here, but thin production aiding showy charisma always highlights how little of his material actually penetrates with songwriting memorability."
1,Bowie's Worst!,"This is his WORST album! I think he just made this album just to make an album. As a matter of fact, the album is so bad, when I bought it I threw it away after hearing every song. ""After All"" was stupid, and ""The Width of a Circle"" reeked. I hate long songs. My one and only long song that's acceptable from Bowie is ""Station to Station."" Don't buy this horrible CD."
2,Typos galore,"As other users have noted, there are a number of mistakes in the book. The book also says that if you pass the self-assessment they will give you a certificate. It's not true. All they do is email you the quiz results. As a consequence of this, I won't try other titles in the 36 hour series."
3,"A warning for those who liked ""It's Terror Time Again""","I don't know why, but for some reason, the two songs from Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island are not sung by the original group (Skycycle) who sang them. And while ""The Ghost is Here"" sounds fine, TTA was horribly redone. The new singer has a nasally voice and delivers several parts of the song poorly. Unfortunately, the original version of TTA is not on any other Scooby Doo CD, nor is it on any of the 2 albums released by Skycycle. So for those who want to listen to the awesome original version of It's Terror Time Again, you'll ether have to find an MP3, or hold a recorder up the the TV.This is not meant to give an overview of the CD and it's quality, only to serve as warning for those who are buying this with ""It's Terror Time Again"" in mind."
4,witches ghost is scary Fun,"The sound track is wonderful fun, and is just that fun and frolic. Not only does it have country singing superstar, but sounds of the Go-Go's and semi sounds of 80's Lady's Pat Benitar, Blondie, and Laura Branigan. The sound track has songs also from the movie "" Scooby Doo on Zombi Island"". There in itself is a bonus. There are several stand outs on this sound track, ""Hex Girls"", ""Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air"" ""The Witches Ghost"", and ""Its a Mystery"". The later being from Velma'a point of view (now that is a treat).Over all, this is a treat for the All Hallows Eve season, Not a Trick. So don't end up with rocks in your entertainment player, get a real treat with ""Scooby Doo and the Witches Ghost"" sound track ; )"
5,Hexcellent!,My boys (7 and 4) can't get enough of this CD. They play it over and over and over in the car. Now dad can sneak in some Jane Wiedlin CD's and The Go Go's every once in a while. Look guys it's a Hex Girl!
4,My thoughts,"Overall I thought it was a good movie, epecially the Hex Girls because they are super cool. I felt like they were contridictary with the witch theme however. Because many wiccans nowdays are witches and to still portray witches as bad was kind of conflicting. Music was great though."
5,xena gabrielle stories,I really enjoyed the stories in this book and I am glad there are authors out there that are willing to continue the adventures of Xena and Gabrielle. The seller of this product was fast about the shipping and the book was in excellent condition when I received it.
4,Ptretty sharp!,"I bought the edited version of this CD and thought it was great. It has a fantastic selection of some of last years quality rap. Though some of the songs get tiresome, it will gain much respect from you and anyone else who hears it. ONLY FOR TRU HIP- HOP FANS!!!!!"
