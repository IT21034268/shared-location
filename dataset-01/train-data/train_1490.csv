2,"A Good Subject, But A Disappointing Book","There has been a trend in the past few years to write books that cover a particular season, and 1960 would be a good year to include in a book. However, I didn't find anything new here. I feel it would be a book more suitable for high school students who are totally unfamiliar with that year in baseball. I was immediately suspicious with repeated misspellings of ""Ebbetts Field"". This would be an easy thing to check. Also on Page 129 I shuddered when I came across the name of ""Johnny DeMaestri"". Joe Demaestri, of course, along with first baseman Kent Hadley (neither mentioned) were acquired by the Yankees along with Roger Maris following the 1959 season. The book is filled out with appendices A-E with statistics, team rosters, trades, etc. I'm sorry, but I was disappointed."
2,Many short stops in short book,"A disappointment. I was distracted by the references to ""Ebbetts Field"" at least three times. Too much space is given to, for example, lists of all the Hall of Famers connected to 1960 baseball. The book tries to give mention to many, many topics, rather than tell the entire year in the context of, say, the Pirates-Yanks World Series or the trade of Roger Maris. (By the way, ""World Series"" should always be capitalized, as should ""Series"" when referring to the WS.)Much of the material is apparently drawn from newspaper and Sporting News accounts of the day, with little apparent content from interviews of surviving players from the day.Many 1960 Topps cards, a nice touch."
3,Needs a remaster,"Decent content,but the recording sounds muddled and flat.Sounds as if they took the master 2 track and just burnt it to a CD without tweaking it for the qualities that CD does best.If you have a medium that gives you superior dynamic range,then take advantage of it.That's the trouble with limited funds and time for musical genres such as this."
4,Great Budget Chopin,"For years I've enjoyed pianist Peter Katin on a handful of Everest recordings, so when I came across this Chopin CD in the Marketplace for a couple of bucks, I figured why not? Well this isn't Rubinstein, but it's always nice to hear a different take on great music, and Chopin's Waltzes are certainly that. The early CD production quality of the Decca ""Weekend Classics"" series leaves a lot to be desired, not to mention non-existent liner notes, but the performance is what matters the most, and this one was quite nice. Katin deserves wider recognition, and reissuing and remastering too, but unfortunately will most likely never receive it."
5,Awesome Techno Album by Traci Lords,"I first heard this cd when I was dancing in a strip club in L.A. Traci Lords is yes the porn star who made headlines with her underagescandal in the 80's. According to her biography, this cd did very well when it came out in the early 90's. It has a number of really great songs including Fallen Angel and Control, which were the singles released of the album. Traci Lords is just sexy anyways you want to spin it and this cd is no joke. A lot of the songs were produced by Juno Reactor, who also had a lot of big hits in the early rave years. I thought maybe this cd would be a little cheesy, but it wasn't whatsoever and there are even a few nice downtempo tracks as well as the harder techno versions. Her voice and lyrics are very sexy and strong. It's a shame she hasn't made a follow up to this album."
5,More than a monotonous beat,"This CD has plenty of beats, but every song has a catchy melody or hook. Traci's vocals fit like a glove. The recording sounds great, too. We used to play this at work every other day. (I wish she'd put out another CD.) Some highlights include the driving ""Fly"" and the surreal dream of ""Say Something."" The closing track, ""Okey Dokey,"" always makes me laugh. ""Here in my purple room..."""
4,No Joke.,"This recording is for real! Long before Moby, Mono, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Garbage and the lot, Lords recorded this fierce, soulful, powerhouse techno soundscape, and it still ranks with the best. Makes Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" look positively feeble in comparison. A wrongfully overlooked triumph."
5,Excellent! - Brilliant ! - Terrific!,"In my own words:Traci I love you.All the tracks have something to offer: Dark, Trance, - touches of Belgian / German techno from the early 90's me-thinks!, and best of all - Traci's smooth sexy voice.The final track on the CD is something of a farce?, like an Acid-house tune from the late 1988, you have a Acid sound box, drop a few funny samples and some speech and you get another wierd but wonderful tune!Final Verdict: Pure Heaven!"
3,Excellent...in spots,"Traci Lords is trying really hard to gain a main stream career, and she definetly deserves it. This cd is about half good and half bad. When it's good, it's excellent, when it's bad, it's embarrassing. Too bad the whole cd couldn't have kept up the energy of the first two tracks and satyed away from that awful song ""Good And Evil"". You deserve a good hard wake up slap for that one Traci!"
3,Cyndy Lauper wannabee,"At some points I did mistake her voice for that of Cyndy Lauper. The music cures insomnia well, because it put me to sleep faster than being conked on the head. The last song, ""okey dokey""-- well, don't you wish you were famous so you could just play with the karoake microphone and get paid a salary for it? I agree with critics that her best talents were in porn. Lords' career reminds me of life itself in many ways. You're in love during the first part and making porn. You're married in the second part and have to go to work, growing old and out of love. The Father's Field song was made into a chapter in her book about a sad molestation event in her childhood. But my sympathy for her has dissolved in later years when everyone else is her tool to use for career advancement. Traci's music would be on the top ten list if she put the songs on a music video strip show."
1,Traci should've stuck with what she did best and what she was known for....,"Traci can not act at all and she can not sing worth crap.only thing she was good at was what she did in the early '80's and she left that.too bad for traci,for she is a pretty woman but just no talent."
1,Talent?,"For those reviews that say she has talent, please point out where. There's not anybody in this world who could not to the synthesized modulated vocals on this type of garbage, including my golden retriever."
5,Sweet Anodized metal,"The pans, so far, have been great. They heat up very nicely and pour wonderfully."
1,Lack of structure & much funny don't make good instruction,"I have danced for quite sometime, grown up with the dance and have taken lessons. This DVD medium for presenting classes is great becuase you to skip and play again and again the parts you need. No need in stoping a class in session of 30-50 people. The advantages of the DVD Medium don't work out well in this DVD. First Al is just to much into trying to make you laugh at slap stick humor. If I try to skip it, I have to fastforward which makes things annoying becuase the bad humor is at the begining of a new step. The moves in this DVD aren't many. I'd have to say the DVD is made up of 70 % moves and 30% useless humor that is old the first time around.Bottom line: I don't recomend this to anyone looking to get their bang for their buck. You will learn more from one night a club watching reasonable good dancers do some stylish spins. Avoid this DVD if your not willing to part with $40 just for the heck of it."
3,Really Heavy Duty...,"Target spinner weighs a ton and direct hits from my 40 Cal. Pistol can't even dent it. But, you'll have to replace the bullseye after each use as each hit knocks off a piece of the original orange circle. Think I'll just get some orange stickers and use a new one each time I go out to shoot. Also, would be better if legs were about a foot longer. When stuck into the ground, you're forced to shoot low to the ground. Overall, worth the price and recommended."
1,The polaroid camera will sit in the closeet,The film was probably old and the picture quality was poor. The polaroid camera will proudly sit inv my closet with film like this in it.
3,Where's Kind Of A Drag?,I bid on this one and purchased it based on the song listing provided. Kind Of A Drag by The Buckinghams is NOT ON THIS CD no matter what the song listing says! Even the photo of the CD cover does not have it listed. Only is the actual song listing on the sight the one that lists this missing song. Bummer!
4,Indian artist of renown,"Francis Newton Souza, 1924-2002, was ""an Indian painter, brought up a strict Roman Catholic under Portuguese colonial rule, later a member of the Communist Party, and now [i.e. 1962] living in London"" -- p. 5 of the book. According to Wikipedia he was a founding member of the Progressive Artists' Group of Bombay and the first modern Indian artist to attain recognition in the west. The book contains a biographical essay by Edwin Mullins, pp.5-45; b&w reproductions, pp.45-104; and seven color plates."
2,a little disappointed,"When i first saw the stand I thought it would be a handy thing to have, but after mounting it to my work bench I discovered it was not precise enough to handle my needs. I guess the only comment I can give is; you only get what you pay for.I improved the mounting technique with small bungy straps to keep the grinder from vibrating loose and replaced some of the mounting hardware with a series of locknuts to keep the guides from shifting while gringer is in operation. It has it's uses, but I feel with a little more time in the design department it could be a very useful tool. But it's like I said...You only get what you pay for"
3,"Even Though It's Billboard, Cadillac of the Industry.....","Like another reviewer asks, where's ""So Much In Love""? And how about ""Our Day Will Come"", ""Fingertips, Part 2"",""Baby Workout"", ""Candy Girl"". ""Hey Paula"", ""I Will Follow Him""? We couldn't seem to get rid of ""Walk Right In"", so where is IT? Are we supposed to just wet our beaks with this stingy compilation? The songs herein are authentic but where's the REST? Time-Life this packager is not. (I could add other hits, but you get the picture)."
3,"Blind Justice, early rap metal!!","Blind Justice was one of those bands that reached legendary status in the CT/NY area in the early 90's. A little funky, a little hard core, but over all very rap metal before that style took over the airwaves(& our nerves). At times the rhymes are cheesy and silly. But the music is heavy ballsy guitar driven hard core(ala Rage) and at times is very funky(Red Hot Chili Peppers). The Dj does and okay job of adding scratches, not compared to their previous DJ. This is a collection of tracks from their demos and CT Comp. tracks. A precursor and superior version of that Nu Metal hip hop stuff."
5,Blind Justice Rocked!,I remember shows on the New Haven green watching these guys tear it up..they were simply amazing! It's too bad they're not a band anymore! This album totally rocks and I'm so glad I got to buy the last copy off of Amazon. :-)
1,Great idea but......,"The idea of a 50"" screen in front of you is great, however the reality is that the clarity is poor because of ghosting and chromatic aboration. But the biggest factor is that it is to heavy for the nose. This could work if it was an adjustable head mount of some kind. I say that this is not yet ready to be on the market."
1,Not suitable for someone who wears glasses,Bought it and it works - the image quality wasnt that great. But its really impossible for me to enjoy a movie because I am nearsighted and needs glasses to watch movies. The iwear comes with a lot of wires and other stuff. More hard to move around with these things
2,Save your money!,I haven`t seen Disney`s Little Mermaid. But this sequel is only suitable for very small children. Adults will find it dull and unoriginal.
2,Star Wars Fanatic! But Wait!See Below!,"I recently got my Kaadu&JarJar and I really have to tell you I think this is the worst painted Jar Jar ever and the Kaadu won't stand up on his own! It's lots of fun lying on its side! oh well I completley LOVE the entire rest of the Star Wars line. But Compared To Opee (the large scary fish) w/Qui Gon Jin, this is just ""cruddy"" in comparison. how come? thanks!"
4,Easy to install but ....,"It arrived in a professional packaged box with detailed instruction for installation. It is easy to install and fits my 99 Taurus 24V DOHC very well except for one small hole. At the bottom of this strut, there are several holes and one of them is to fix break line using a screw. The hole is supposed to have threads inside so the the screw can be tightened up. But no threads at all in MONROE strut. So I could not use the original screw and have to find a smaller bolt and nut."
4,Great Ride and Control,"I have a 2001 Ford Taurus with 102,000 miles on it. I bought all four Monroe struts. The ride and control are greatly improved its like having a new car."
4,"Great product, great price","I installed these myself. They came with everything needed and worked perfectly. For a ford Taurus you will need a nut for the brake line bolt. The OEM motorcade strut towers have threads for the brake line holder, these do not."
2,171615 front strut,Top mounting bolts did not line up. Will have to compress springs and turn mounting bolts to right position. Noticed there wasn't a left and right like Gabriels but Monroe says they are interchangeable.
3,Good music,"Not much to say, I'm enjoying it.. Good efficiency in sending it. I really like Burl Ives-one of the old time greats."
3,Punisher,"I will say the Punisher is the best 12 inch scale figure I have ever seen. And It would be a shame for anyone to leave them in the package. Speaking of witch, the packages .... Not that there poorly designed or anything, they look cool. But opening them is a pain. But after all the work it pays off once you get whats inside. A truely great toy."
4,If you like Max B...,"...then you will like this CD. He actually has some entertaining lyrics and songs, but its definitely only for those people who don't despise his voice."
2,"I'd like that shower now, please...","There's an amazing quote on the back cover of this book, something along the lines of, ""Without obscenity, our cities are dreary places and life is bleak."" And wholeheartedly agreeing - the Disneyfication of NYC 42nd Street to my mind rips the heart out of the city - I plunge in. What do I find? Nothing much that's terribly obscene, merely sorta sad and tawdry. The only thing that seperates it from a technically accomplished photodocumentation of a fratboy bachelor party is the mild millennial frisson the [gaijin] reader gets from the Tokyo floating-world setting. The Kenneth Starrs of the world (and there are lots, wouldn't you know) will find plenty to gasp at - ""Look! She's got his penis in her mouth! Shocking!"". But for the rest of us, Araki-san and his many imitators will have to do better if they truly want to save us from our sterilized, sanitized, thoroughly G-rated future."
2,Not so fun,"Tokyo Novelle is a much more enjoyable book than this one is. It is the difference between artful sluttiness and sleazy seediness. A lot is made of how the ladies photographed were amateurs, but this is confusing topless stripper-type amateurs that take up half of this book with the more hard core sex worker that make up the other half. It becomes depressing. All in all, this book came across as self-serving and smug."
2,Outdated,"While the information in this book is useful, it is a bit outdated. I recommend Ragnar Benson's newer book, ""Do-It-Yourself Medicine"", which was written as an update to this book."
2,Disappointment,Very disappointed with this thick pamphlet. I am going to assume I made a silly misinterpretation of the description at the time of purchase.
1,Not recommended,"I do not recommend this book in any situation. There are other books out there that are far better. Scut Monkey puts out a pocket drug guide that covers are more information, is VERY easy to use and is accurate.This book may have had a place many years ago, however there are now much better references for the money."
2,I really wanted more,All this tells the reader is to go out animal meds for human illnesses because the meds are the sameI really wanted a guide Diagnosis process - med type - and Dosing. I'm hoping Do it yourself Medicine gives me more info.
3,Portrait of the Sith Lord as a young boy,"I have come to loathe all things ""Prequel,"" but when the hype surrounding the (then) upcoming Episode I was at its peak, I enthusiastically bought all of Kenner's 12"" figures in the Episode I line. When the line was in full swing Kenner introduced a few smaller figures that were to scale with the larger figures. One of which was this Anakin Skywalker figure.Pros - For what it is, this is a pretty good looking figure. It has a decent outfit and head sculpt.Cons - There's not much to it. A pod-racing helmet would have been a cool accessory.This is far from an essential figure, but it's still worth getting, especially if you're putting together an Anakin to Darth Vader display (yes, I'm dork enough to have done such a thing)."
3,Pass the tomato sauce please,"I won't give another plot synopsis; there are enough already here (I recommend the one by Luan Gaines). I will say that I found this book to be entertaining, a light and fun read but it certainly isn't a great work of literature. This book is actually a spaghetti western, only it's set in medieval Wales instead of the Old West. The hero is mysterious, able to always appear at the right time and pretty perfect. The bad guy is a vile character with absolutely no redeeming qualities. He even dresses in solid black so you can fully comprehend his evilness. The heroine is feminine and strong but has a knack for getting into trouble. Luckily, the hero is usually there to rescue her.All in all, it's not a bad book. It's rather predicatable and you wish Clint Eastwood would make a cameo but it makes for a good beach or rainy day read."
4,Tasty Tomato Sauce,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer about this being a spaghetti western set in medieval times. And while it's true, the bad guys were really bad, and the good guys were unbelievably good (with a propensity for appearing Merlin-like at the right moments) I took it for what it was worth and really enjoyed it. I especially like the period detail and the way the author transported the reader with short but effective phrases that set the scene.If you like historical romance, you won't be disappointed."
4,Magical Voice,Jane's magical voice spins a compelling tale of violence and love through the tumult of English occupied Wales during the 100 years war. The first conflict in a tiny hamlet is remarkably intimate and detailed. The conclusion was well crafted and satisfying. Exceptionally enjoyable--
2,Recommended for lovers of this particular era...1350's Wales,"I am lover of historical fiction and while the Medieval Period certainly interests me, this book isn't a favorite by any means. I found it rather boring and slow and I had to force myself to continue reading it, as opposed to having my friends/husband dragging me away from a book that I love to do other things.I will recommend the novel, but only to those people who have particular interest in this time period and location- 1350's Wales. I do not think all lovers of historical fiction will enjoy this book, although I'm sure those interested in the particular era will find it interesting."
5,"They stopped him short. It's over, Kentucky wins!!!","This is an excellent video of this historic game in the annals of UK sports. This dvd contains the entire game, all 4 heart-pumping quarters and more. You see the great players of the time, and coaches Miles & Brooks, working hard to bring home a victory. UK qb Andre Woodson shines, with back-breaking passes to Stevie Johnson and Jacob Tamme, as well as Keenan Burton. Also, Rafael Little breaks free for some drive-extending runs. And it takes you into the overtimes that added so much more to the instant classic qualities of this great, great game! It all culminates with one of UK's all-time defensive stands, and an all-out celebration for the Big Blue!"
2,Not so great...,"I bought this toy looking for something to keep my son entertained in the bathtub. The crayons included turned to mush and fell apart immediately after getting them wet. The wrappers fell off and they became too slippery for my son to hold and they also stained the tub. After throwing the crayons out the toy is O.K. My son likes to use the piano and the drums on it. As far as the songs that it plays... well... lets just say you'll be lucky if you can understand them... never mind your child. They are sung very fast and you can tell they are the ABC's and numbers but as far as your child learning from them, I think it's highly unlikely."
4,Good Stuff - Not Enough of It,The whole Billboard Series of Top Rock 'n' Roll Hits is great. Rhino has done it usual good job. But for cryin' out loud guys! TEN TRACKS? I would have rated this a 5 if it had TWENTY tracks. <sigh>
3,The Beatles?,"Billboard 1964 without the Beatles? The biggest moment in rock history occurs, and it's neglected? The songs are good on this disc, though I agree with the criticism that there should have been more than ten. However, it's a serious oversight to not include the Beatles..."
4,hits to sing,"great songs to sing toBread n Butter is goofyUnder the Boardwalk who hasn't heard this by the Drifters even john cougar did a version recentlyI Get Around the cool drag strip song of the timeLittle Old Lady another Jan and Dean classicOut of Limits surf guitar instrumental toe tapperSuspicion (not very good,but billboard put it here)Chapel of Love another girl group doo-wop songLeader of the Pack the cool girl group songThe Zombies She's Not There' is rock n roll for '64 fast organ solo riffall the original versionsLast Kiss weak song with a morbid tonegreat tape to play in the car while crusin'"
3,Good Ideas but no flow,This book has some funny commentary and some decent writing depicting a bleak point of view. I enjoyed it but this book will make you cringe more than giggle.
3,Ambitious but falls short,"I loved ""Get in the Van"". To be a great writer, you need to be a great reader. I know Henry's library must be extensive. In that library, there must be a number of works by Charles Bukowski. Now when I first read Bukowski, I wanted to be Bukowski. I feel that Henry fell into this trap. The writing imitates Bukowski's work too closely. It's still a great way to pass the time and I'm sure Henry has improved since this collection of writings. I will continue to read what this writer has to say. He's a strong presence and is always challenging himself in various artistic outlets. Henry Rollins is a very important voice in our time."
3,...in the spirit it is intended.,"Henry Rollins has to be one of the only living modern folk heros for the hard core. I bought this book around the time I also bought my first computer, just to see what a self published book looked like and to see what the quality was like. What I got in the mail (from a little used bookstore in New York) was a compelling read in which the author's voice comes through loud and clear. In fact, it was a lot like one of Rollins' spoken word shows -- at times, thoughtful and introspective and others, loud, in your face and intense. If you find this book in a used book store some where, buy it. You won't be sorroy. Worst case? You have an out of print book written by, I'll say it again, a modern folk hero for the hard core."
3,Black Coffee Blues,"When i first started reading Black Coffee Blues i liked it because it was very different and it made me think about things that i wouldnt have normally. It was interesting because it put many of the horrible things that happen in this world in your face. After i got further into this book i started to get bored because it seemed repetitive and depressing. I feel that this is a good book to read because it makes you think about the reality of soceity and the frailty of life, but once i was half done i just wanted Rollins to shut up."
3,It changed my life.,"This book is a cure for existential angst, a spectacular way of getting over a break up, a comfort for solitude, and a good way to alter they way you look at existence. I recommend it for any deep thinker. However, for those of you who are sheltered, it may be a little eye opening. Read at your own risk. I LOVED it!"
5,Stupendous!,"This book is an A.P. History student's best friend. Not only does it offer an excellent written acount of the history of the United States of America, but it also contains a cute little action cartoon as well! On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being the least helpful and 10 being the most... i'd rate it about a 9.5."
5,Now My Guitar Looks Awesome,"Now My Guitar Looks awesome. Gold is perfect if you want a great and cool style. my Strat seems different, I cant believe it, it's just what I wanted."
5,500 Derrieres!!!,"This might be the granddaddy of all derriere books. It features over 500 select photographs from twenty-nine of the world's greatest art and glamour photographers, each of whom is semi-obsessed with the female rump. And more than just a superb collection of photographs, the artist text that accompanies each of the twenty-nine sections is very illuminating and is a nice touch. Contributing photographers include: Jimon Aframian, Pascal Baetens, Jean-Paul, FOUR, Christian Gomez, Herbert Hesselmann, Roman Kasperski, Ralph Kerpa, Chas Ray, Krider, Borys Kurylo, Peter Legler, Thomas Meyer, Richard Murrian, Simon Nicolai, Alexander Paulin, Michael Pecha, Joerg Skarabis, Matthias Stolt, Paul von Stroheim, Gorden Thye, Herve de Varez, Frank Wartenberg, Tamara Amhoff-Winderler, Anna & Barney, Jens Bruggemann, and Otto Weisser.Did I mention that this book showcases over FIVE-HUNDRED fannies??? It is spectacular!"
5,Thank God there are lots more Claire Malloys to read!,"What a pleasant surprise! I'd read a ""Maggody"" mystery some time ago, not realizing there was another Joan Hess series to savor. Claire Malloy is bright, sarcastic, ironic, and funny as all get-out. The plot has enough twists and turns to keep you going... I stayed up way too late two nights in a row to finish it. Peter Rosen has definite possibilities, although his character wasn't developed quite as much as Claire's; since this was Claire's opening gambit, however, that's understandable. Loved this book, and right now I'm trying to figure out the order in which the rest were written so I can follow through properly (I always read a series in order to follow character development). Definitely have your library rustle up a copy of this one, and, I suspect, the rest of the series, as well!"
2,Strangled Prose,"I would have enjoyed this book much more had the Kindle version not ""strangled her prose"" indeed with errors...dozens and dozens, going on page after page. It was too distracting to concentrate on the book. Deleted words, misplaced punctuation, misspellings, truncated sentences.By the time I arrived at the climax, I was in no mood for the contrived ending."
2,You've seen all this before,"Not a very well thought out plot and yes, once again, the relationship energy comes from the police character."
5,really good and very complete,Despite its relative age the book is very well preserved and its content is very full with very good pictures and drawings. Recommended for warships enthusiasts.
3,She's ok...,She was so much better live than in recorded form. She has a very powerful voice. Her songs are dreary and not as full (recorded) as they were live. She should consider writing some happy songs. I cannot listen to her whole CD without changing it b/c it is so dismal.
5,Wow,"I saw a snippet of Noella Hutton on some Lillith Fair coverage recently. Immediately I knew I needed to hear what she has produced. I had never heard of her and she sounded intense. So I spent the one penny plus shipping and handling expecting the worst -- I mean, what can you possibly get for a penny? I thought it might be one of those buys where I hate one song, scan through a couple others, and sell it before I even hear it once. But wow! I mean wow! You know how most albums/CD's have a stinker or two? Even your favorite artists can put out a few that you have to skip through or program out. This piece was incredible ALL THE WAY THROUGH. The writing AND the music were so original and listenable and poetic and passionate! I could not believe it. It's the best penny I ever spent in my life. Now it's ""discontinued."" Isn't it just the way of things? Ms. Hutton, if you haven't already, PLEASE MAKE MORE MUSIC and grace our collections with your extraordinary gift."
5,Noella rocks!,Noella has one of the most powerful female voices in music today.AND she worte everyone of these songs! Great songwriter as well.Rumor has it her next album will be released early next year!Can't wait!
4,Just an all around good solid rock album.,Noella has a strong voice and uses it well. I enjoyed the entire album. I am looking forward to future releases from this lady.
5,if you love comfort you will love these,"excellent buy for the money. was looking around on the net and amazon was the cheapest , especially my size {15}..very hard to find mind you.the comfort of the foot bed is great and the look of them are quite smart...give them a try you will love them.."
3,Too large for wearer,"I bought these as a Christmas gift, but they were too large so they were returned. Unfortunately, they could not be exchanged because the smaller size was out of stock. I will re-visit the review if I can ever get them in the correct size."
3,Not as good as they used to be...,"Bought them for my wife & she doesn't care for them at all (she says they hurt her feet).I also bought a pair for myself, to replace my old ones. They look the same, however they are harder & stiffer. I doubt they will last 6 yrs like my last pair."
2,Fair Product,"I wish these sandals had a smooth sole. I bought these because I teach ballroom dancing 25 hours a week, and my feet need something soft to relax. These don't cut it."
3,ok for shower,"i bought these to use as shower shoes in the gym, so far they are ok. nothing to write home about - personally i found scuba shoes to work better and maintain less of an odor, as well as being cheaper."
1,painfull for *my* feet,like others have stated here -- uncomfortable -- NO arch support!every step a shock to my spine -- NOT soft at all -- ordered these when I couldn't find the older style Adidas [ softer - more form fittin ] that I'd had for YEARS -- wore em out finally :(VERY disapointed with these!
3,COMODAS,"SON COMODAS, PERO HAY Q TENER CUIDADO CON LAS TALLAS, CREO Q SON HOLMAS GRANDES, PEDI TALLA 12 Y LA VERDAD ES QUE SON MAS GRANDE DE LO NORMAL..ASI Q HAY Q PEDIR UN TALLA MENOS PARA Q QUEDEN CORRECTAS EN EL PIE.."
1,i absolutly hate them,these are by far the worst sandles i have ever worn they are litteraly painful.i had the old styl ones and they where so much better i wore them everywhere and never wore shoes regardless of what the weather was like.these ones i just spent $30 on less then 24 hrs ago have been the most expensive chew toys i have ever given too my dog.
4,Great!,I like these alot. Only wish the strap would have been able to go tighter. All in all I love them. I will buy them again
4,Soccer Sandal,"Great for mucking around when you don't want to e barefoot, wear shoes. Quieter than flip flops too. I have owned rede before and didn't think twice about purchasing them a second time."
5,"I'm on my 3rd pair - Not because they stink, but because I love them!","Every few years I need to buy another pair of these. They fall apart in the same place. Eventually the strap breaks apart from the sole on both feet. It is more sad than anything else because you get attached to these, they are my favorite slippers/sandals. I wear them for quick trips to the store, walking the dog, outdoor projects, washing the car, get the mail. These are my go to shoes when i need to talk outside really quick and dont want to fart around with laces.Its that time again, I need a new pair! I wouldn't buy anything else. You will not be disappointed with the comfort, why do you think they are always sold out? They rock."
5,Nice & comfortable,"These were purchased for my son-in-law (for Christmas, so he hasn't opened them) & they seem perfect for wearing down to the beach or wherever. My husband tried them on & really liked the feel & comfort level. Seem pretty true to size."
5,Excellent Seller,"I received the product in perfect condition as it indicated the seller, I recommend it 100%, it has worked very well! I use it a lot to even go to college, parties, and many other things, as it is very useful in every way!"
3,"Comfortable, started to fall apart after wearing a few times","I wore these around the house and yard, perhaps a couple of hours a day for the past three weeks. Over the past week they required tightening - I assumed the straps were just stretching. Nope - they were separating from the side of the sole where they are attached. The inside of the straps is a soft, felt-like material. This is glued to the sides of the base. The felt (or whatever it is) is separating - part is still on the glue and part on the strap - but it's split up the middle. So the front 1/2"" or so of each strap's front is no longer attached to the base. This happened to both sides of the left sandal and one side on the right sandal. I used hot-melt glue to repair them. Hopefully this works. If not, it's in the trash for these.The overall quality is good and the sandals are comfortable - I just wish the construction quality was better."
3,"Decent Sandal, not good for shower sandal","Solid construction and comfortable. However, I purchased to use as a shower sandal at the gym and mixed results. Performs well in terms of foot traction and comfort, but the back of the strap is fabric and after a few shower uses this tends to dry with a strong mildew smell. Have to throw sandals in the wash machine after every 2 or 3 uses to prevent this. So, overall a good sandal, but would not recommend for repetitive shower use."
5,Comfy!,"I bought these for my husband after he tried a different pair of Adidas sandals, the kind with the raised ""massaging"" footbed. He hated them but these are almost flat with a slight bubbling footbed for traction."
3,Good but not great,"After reading all the love for these bad boys from the Amazon faithful, I've decided to give them a try. As perfect as they are made out to be, the little bumps going across the sandals become irritating after a while, enough to take them off and give your feet a breather. The quality is good, so far. Can't complain in that department. The price is also an advantage. So all in all, Calissage sandals are good in quality, and fair in price, but aren't for everyone."
3,Ok but smelly,These sandals do the trick but I've found that they smell after wearing them even just a few times. I didn't think anything of it until someone else said they have the same ones and that theirs especially stink. I've never had that problem with any sandal before. Shoes I've worn for years are not even that bad!
4,Slidin' In,"This is my third pair of Adidas Calissage. I still have and use the first pair, and threw the second pair out after the velcro quit on me. They are comfortable, fast and easy to put on and seem to clean up fine in the washing machine. Not sure if that's what killed the second pair, but the first pair has got to be at least ten years old and going strong. Hopefully this pair will last awhile too."
5,Great slipper,This is the best sandal I've ever owned. Great comfort and support for the foot. Cool design as well. I'd recommend it to anyone.
4,Sandals,"I ordered a size too big but kept them anyway. Great shower shoe, they dry fast and are comfortable. if these are as great as my last pair - these will last the next 2 years."
4,stylish poolside kicks,These are good looking slide in sandals for the pool deck. I found them slightly more difficult to get the fit exactly right compared to a very well worn old pair but I suspect a few more days by the pool should cure that forever.
4,nice quality,"looks good sitting on counter. Slightly larger than most garlic keepers. Easily fits 2 heads of garlic, but just 1/2 inch too small to hold a 3rd one."
5,Garlic saved :D,"I love this product. It looks great in my spice cabinet, and keeps my garlic fresh for weeks! No more little garlic shoots in my fresh garlic. I like the clay material (though I am sometimes worried I am going to drop and break it)."
5,really nice,This is really nice. It fits a few pieces of garlic which is perfect. I got in much faster then I thought I would.
5,$16.69.... really?,"This garlic keeper is perfect.... well made and decent size. It holds 3 medium heads.The issue I have is the pricing here... MyCuisina, the company selling through Amazon, sells it on their site for $8.99. Really, Amazon? I mean I understand you have to make a profit, but $7.70 is a helluva surcharge on an $8.99 item."
5,Perfect garlic keeper,"This garlic keeper is the perfect size and looks good too. Nice wide opening, unlike my last one where I had to push the garlic heads in. Received product promptly and in perfect condition."
4,A Fitting Conclusion,"This album's excellence has been oveshadowed by the fact that it was the Ramones's last. But the truth is that this album can compete with ""Road to Ruin"" and ""Mondo Bizarro"" for the best second tier Ramones album. Of course it cannot compare to ""The Ramones"" or ""Rocket to Russia"" but still a worthy album. This album is one of the Ramones more beautiful ones. Songs like ""Baby I Love You"" and ""Life's a Gas"" compare in beauty to ""Pet Cemetary"" and even ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend."""
4,"Alas, the Ramones!","Boy, can you sense the irony in the opener, ""I Don't Want to Grow Up""? You'd've thought Tom Waits wrote it just for them--it's damn near perfect! Like almost every Ramones album for the last fifteen years (excluding the first four albums, ""Pleasant Dreams"" and ""Animal Boy"") ""Adios Amigos"" contains some great stuff along with some mediocrity. ""SHe Talks to Rainbows"" is beautiful--boy, was Joey a hippie in the old days or what? ""Life's a Gas"" is pleasant indeed. CJ handles his vocal turns just fine. I really think the last song, ""Born to Die in Berlin"" is terrific: it hearkens back to the WWII/German references on the first few albums that stemmed from departed bassist DeeDee's childhood. This song just grinds with frustration and aggression, with a great Stooges-like riff that captures an anger the Ramones rarely showed. A great show-stopper to end their final album with. Man, I love these guys!"
3,Last studio album has its moments,"'I Don't Want To Grow Up' is one of the best songs the Ramones ever recorded. It comes as a happy surprise at the kick-off of what was promised to be the band's last ever studio album (to date they have kept to that promise). The rest of the album is uneven. 'Have a Nice Day', 'She Talks To Rainbows' and the excellent Dee-Dee track 'Born To Die In Berlin' are powerful songs, 'Scatter Gun' is another good one, sung by C-Jay -- but doesn't sound anything like a traditional Ramones song. There aren't any dogs among the remaining tracks, but nothing you'll feel like listening to repeatedly either. Note: Theres a humorous Ramones version of the 60s 'Spiderman' TV theme hidden after the last track."
4,GABBA GABBA HEY WE ACCEPT YOU AS ONE OF US.,"I'll sure miss um. This album was their last and they went out with a bang. Sure this album aint gunna change the world it aint gunna have 5top 40 smashes but its The Ramones. This is a fun fast punk album with attitude. This album made me cry after Joey died ""Lifes A Gas"" i probably played 30 times, no joke. Dee-Dee wrote 5 songs for this album , including the haunting ""Born To Die In Berlin"" him being german made it even sader.r.i.p Dee-Dee you are sorley missed.this is a good Ramones album any pinhead should own it by now if not buy it. ok"
3,"THE RAMONES' FINAL STUDIO ALBUM: NICE TRY, GUYS.","The Ramones' final studio album is not great, but not bad either. There are a handful of very good songs, such as ""I Don't Want To Grow Up,"" ""Scattergun"" (a very un-Ramones song written and sung by bassist C.J.), and the powerful and dark ""Born To Die In Berlin."" The rest of the songs are only average. of the 13 songs on the album, five were written by former bassist Dee Dee, and 2 are cover songs. That leaves only 5 songs which were even written by the band, and largely explains the albums' mediocrity. It is not their worst album, however, and is certainly worth adding to your collection."
2,Dismal Documentary,"A careful but rather biased account of California's environmental disasters, this book will make the thoughtful reader feel depressed, because it offers no solution to any of the problems it exposes."
4,U.S. musicians fighting back against the British invasion,"In 1965 the British Rock Invasion was quickly becoming much more than the Beatles and this collection of hits shows that American music was starting to offer up something in the way of a meaningful response. Certainly the Beach Boys doing ""Help Me Rhonda,"" The Righteous Brothers powering through ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" and Barry McGuire's ""Eve of Destruction"" are steps in the right direction. Opinion is more diverse regarding ""Wooly Bully"" and pretty much anything by Sonny & Cher. As every one in class knows, the rule of thumb when judging a greatest hits collection is whether you find five or more songs you would love to add to your music library. Depending on how extensive your personal collection happens to be right now, this one has got a good shot at passing that litmus test."
3,"OMIT THE ""NAME GAME"" AND YOU HAVE A GOOD CD","On 2/12/2000, I had the pleasure of hearing Barry McGuire sing his 1965 social classic, ""Eve of Destruction"" with John Michael Talbot. That is a very powerful song with a very relevant message.Ever since I was a very little child, I have had a strong, constitutional aversion for ""the Name Game."" As a child, I would run from the room or turn off the radio. I said at 3, ""That's not a song. It's stupid and bad because those aren't REAL words. I'm glad MY name's not in it."" I hate the ""Name Game"" as much today as I did then. It is intolerable, idiotic, highly annoying and has nothing in creation to recommend it. The ""Name Game"" has cost this otherwise good collection 2 stars."
4,changing times,"The Name Game-interesting when your a kid but kind of boring to hear nowLovers Concerto a take off on a bach piano concertoThis Diamond Ring Gary Lewis big hit that year and fun to sing,even though its a sad songHelp Me Rhonda the beach boys ba ba ba song what does it mean?You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' what can i say, its good,also sung in the top gun movieWooly Bully another hammond organ riff song1-2-3 well this is heard even in commercials today and rallies at sport games for chantsTreat Her Right R&B soulI got you babe-classic sonny&cher tuneEve of Destruction wow its the end times with all the wars in this bob dylan-esc styled protest"
2,Mouse Trouble,"This KVM works as expected except for two problems. Sometimes the mouse will stop working for me as if I was to unplug and the replug the mouse from the machine. I guess there is a slight glitch in the electrical connection when the KVM switches between computers. It's really annoying because when this happens you must reboot the computer to get the mouse functionality back. Also, this KVM beeps a couple of times when you switch between computers. I have not been able to turn this feature off and I would rather just have a silent KVM switch. But, it isn't a complete piece of crap. Most of the time it does it's job ok.Also note that the KVM does not come with a power supply. Theoretically it can draw all of it's power from the PS/2 keyboard connection of the computers. But, in practice I've found that not all computers are able to deliver enough power. You may have to buy a 5V-9V DC power adapter of your own, I did."
2,Good information; ridiculous price,"I read a lot of books on market analysis, and from the first few pages this seems to be a good one. But: $129. for a paperback? Hopefully this is a mistake. The hardcover version also sells for $129--how can that be a reasonable pricing decision?"
2,wasn't impressed,"I bought this toy based on the other reviews, but when our arrived, I wasn't impressed at all. It was going to be a Christmas gift, but I returned it instead. Why wasn't I impressed? I thought that it was harder than described to stack the monekys and the launching board didn't work well either. I was sad that I was not pleased, I was looking forward to having a fun toy for my boys. I wouldn't get this toy."
2,Didn't hold our interest,"I have three boys, ages 9, 7 and 5. This toy was a gift. We found it to be novel - wowee, I can flip monkeys into the air and they will stick to this board! But it didn't hold our interest. It takes minimal skill, and you don't have a lot of control over the ""flipping,"" so it's not like you can employ a strategy. I can see how it would be fun at the Thanksgiving event another reviewer described, where kids don't have their own toys. Or with kids who don't play together often (like the reviewer with kids who are not close in age). But for my boys, who have many, varied, and complex games they have developed for playing together - this game was a dud."
5,love the monkeys,Great game! We love this! I pull it out in waiting rooms at doctors and dentist. We also take it when we go camping or to Grandmas house. I've seen many adults play this longer than the kids :)
4,Cool,"This is a cool toy but it has some things that are a little bit...um......ify. The first thing is that the slot does not fit many things. The second is that the voice recorder doesn't record just the way your voice is. The third and final thing is(This is a little bit silly but..)the wallet smells like rubber.Overall, this is a pretty good toy so go for it!P.S. I hope this was a little help to you moms out there buying Christmas presents.Remeber to review this!"
5,spy wallet is great!,The spy xp-5 wallet is the 2 best out of wildplanet toys! Its no pease of junk! I LOVE IT!
1,Microtek SlimScan,I was very disappointed with this purchase. when it arrived finely I opened the box plugged it in to find out it was broken and did not work.
4,Groovy Train,"Hadn't heard this for a long time, till I picked it up in a used CD bin for a buck. Wow this record has aged well, great grooves splashed with dancehall, reggae and more. And with Ryder's unmistakeable vocals layered on top of everything...get on this groovy train, you don't need a ticket..."
5,Original and Brilliant,"This is easily one of the best CD's I own...this music is just so amazing! Nothing comes close to Big Day In The North, In The Name Of The Father.....BUY IT NOW!!!!"
3,Billboard/Rhino Needs To Retire This Series - Or Upgrade,"It's hard to believe that this series from Billboard/Rhino, dating back to the dawn of the CD era in 1988, continues to be available.Ten to twelve selections with no liner notes [here you get brief track-by-track comments] might have sold when the format was still a novelty, but it seems silly to pay this price now for 10 selections that are easily obtainable on 20- to 25-track compilations - and for only a few dollars more.What Billboard/Rhino needs to do is re-invent the series with the addition of at least ten tracks each, and by including some comprehensive historical background notes to bring them in line with the competition from the likes of Ace Records of London."
3,Lost with Andrei,"This book was originally written in Swedish and takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia. To me, the story about Andrei was confusing.Andrei remembers the house he lived in when he was in his mother's stomach. When she disappears, he is taken to a children's home. Here he meets a friend, Vova, who has never met his mother because she was a dog and only wanted puppies. Andrei and his little friend leave to find Andrei's mother. He remembers she wears a blue dress and has a barrette in her hair. I'm not sure how it ended, it was unclear to me.Sweet watercolors illustrate the boys' journey through the bustling city."
5,I love this cd,"This is one of the greatest CD's because all of the songs are good. Ecspecially, Build me up Buttercup (the foundations) and sugar, sugar (the Archies.) I hope everyone loves thisa cd as much as I do. Also, the songs were billboard hits, so they should be good. Thanx!"
4,Old Songs,Nothing betterRecorded only a few songs but they were worth the money!!! Have to put more words in for this comment ot be accepted. Buy this if you like classic rock & roll
5,Wonderful Year of Music,"On the cusp of a brand new decade, 1969 offered up some amazing songs and 10 of them are captured on this CD alone. Crystal Blue Persuasion instantly takes the listener back to that period, it gives me chills when I listen to it. Aquarius/Let The Sun Shine and Sugar, Sugar are equally amazing. Granted, many other 1969 musical gems are missing from this collection, but it does a nice job transporting the listener to what seems like a much simpler, happy time..."
2,slow shipping,"I was pleased with the CD, the only problem it arrived 2 days after promised and was not here for the party. Very disappointing."
1,Not Alive,Do yourself a favor and buy It's Alive instead. This one is a tired band going through the motions. Any version of the Ramones just going through the motions does not work. Joey sounds like he is totally bored.
2,Far better live albums out there,I was actually at this show when they recorded it in NYC. I couldn't wait to buy it when it came out and I was thoroughly disappointed. Ramones shows are very quick and have a fluidity to them. This album takes away all of that by mixing up the play list and only putting in half of the songs. If you must buy a Ramones live album (and I heavily suggest you do) go for Loco Live or It's Alive. They each grasp the full spirit of the band and better convey what a real show was like. The Ramones were one of the best ever live bands to see and Greatest Hits Live was put together so poorly that I almost wish I hadn't bought it.It does get snaps for the couple of studio tracks (R-A-M-O-N-E-S was unintelligible before this) and because the songs themselves are so good.
2,Ya wanna know why I'm the first one to write about thisdisc?,"It's because it's a totally redundant contract-filler. The songs aren't the problem; it's the lack of excitement. Joey even sounds kinda bored... well, make that more bored than usual. What a drag. Makes the competent LOCO LIVE album look like a masterpiece in comparison (tho' IT'S ALIVE still stands as the true classic, and one of the best live rock albums of all time). Leave this alone... for completists only. (Guilty!)"
3,Pretty but petite,"This is a very pretty bracelet. It was a little smaller then I believed it was and it was a gift for a friend who is not exactly small. I would purchase it for myself, but I would've liked a width measurement. Overall a good bracelet for a good price."
1,If I could give less than 1 star I would,I ordered one for my sister and it arrived with one link missing in one place and another link dangling in another place. I immediately returned it for a refund. Thankfully I got everything back. This bracelet is really flimsy and not worth the $99 price tag. Save yourself the headache with this one and get a different bracelet.
3,the book is informative but...,"like many books on spiritual subjects, many people approach their books with the attitudes of ""life is beautiful and mystical"" new age crap, and ted andrews didn't really go into examples of pathworking which i've felt he should of because if you're going to explain something, why not go all the way.but like i said, the book is informative based in simple terms. i have tried some of the exercises out of the book and the information i've recieved was alarming, but then again i think it was my own subconscious relaying communication and not from outside spiritual forces or the angels of the sepheres.so all in all i think the book is ok-not great."
3,Bosch needs better quality control,"The first one I received was defective. The bit-holder end wasn't fully machined inside, so a bit couldn't be inserted at all. Amazon (as always) quickly sent a replacement at no charge. This one works well enough to keep, but the bit holder is overly tight, so it takes quite a bit of pressure to insert the bit.Once the bit is in, it works very well. It's nice and slim so it can fit in a tight space. I would NOT want a bulky screw-holding sleeve on it as another reviewer suggested."
3,so-so,"I lost the tiny retaining ring that is located at the tip after about my third use. Overall it is a quality product, but if you loose this retaining ring, even though it has a magnet inside, the bit your using will fall out."
4,"Magnet good, Gravity bad","I purchased the six-inch bit holder slightly less than a year ago (for $5.80). The extra reach afforded by this bit holder (as well as its slender profile by contrast to locking and sliding bit extensions) has rendered it invaluable in tight quarters. After moderate to heavy use in an impact driver nearly every day for the past several months, it continues to hold up superbly.On one occasion the magnet did fail, causing a driver bit to become dislodged from the bit holder; I no longer rely upon the magnet when positioned upside down. This poses a minor inconvenience, however bits continue to remain securely in place during normal usage or when resting horizontally.Though it has proven tremendously useful and resilient under pressure, I am hesitant to offer a completely enthusiastic recommendation of this product at nearly double the price paid just ten months ago."
4,Rock & Roll History,"Simply, rock & roll legends paying homage to one of their idols. George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Ringo Star, and Rosanne Cash venerating one of the rock's most influential guitarists. As the video was a ""made for T.V."" special, the video and audio are very good. Its a must have music DVD."
5,C.P.E. Bach (6 Symphonies)...,"Christopher Hogwood, et. al., does it again with this outstanding collection by one of the esteemed Herr Bach's musically talented, sons! A good work, please check it out for yourself (I heard this on KUSC in Los Angeles - and ordered it as soon as I could)!I rate this disc: 5 stars!"
3,Sppon rest,"I love the look of this spoon rest. I was a little shocked by how big it was. It is huge! It would work nicely as a wall decoration. I do use it on my stove but it barely fits, although it does accomodate large utensils so it is all right. Cleans up easily."
3,Noticed nothing but that awful taste,The only way I could tolerate taking this was by mixing in about a spoonful into a glass of carrot juice. It tastes strange. I did not notice any difference while taking it and didn't see the point in continuing. Bleh.
5,Cool insider's collectable,"Ok, I admit it, I'm a lover of Star Trek and all the associated stuff. Always have been always probably will be. 'Nuff said. Now what is cool about this particular item, is it truly is an insider's thing. When the movie ""Generations"" came out, all the associated gear, toys, and what all did as well. Obviously Playmates had an advance copy of the script since the scene in which Kirk wore this suit, wasn't in the final production. I picked up one in Toys R Us and thought ""Score""! I read about this scene in the book, but it never was in the movie until recently when the movie was released onto DVD, where you can see the scene where Kirk is ""Orbital Jumping"" for thrills in the deleted scenes."
1,*sigh* What went wrong?,"Ok, F-Punk is probally the worst BAD album that was released, even Higher Power had its moments, but F-Punk is very poor, the song ""I turned out a Punk"" tells all, Mick is trying to retreat back to his early days by playing more heavily guitar based music, thats not why we love BAD, we love BAD for its innoative cutting-edge sounds, something they were all about in the '80s.This is a very poor album and an album you should stear clear of. Its follow up ""Entering the NewRide"" was never released, though from what i have heard it is as good as anything from there early days, why couldn't have Radioactive Records refused to have released the instead of ""Entering the Newride""!"
1,B.A.D. turns BAD,"Wow. Where do I start. ""Higher Power"" at least had some redeeming moments but this is terrible. It is almost as if Mick is completely out of ideas or what to do. ""Vitamin C"" gets my vote as worst B.A.D. song ever and everything else is just about as bad. Do yourself a favor and check out the debut or the excellent ""Megatop Pheonix""."
1,Lost it,"I was a big Clash fan and that carried over to BAD. I like all of BAD's albums, but this one stinks. It's so hard to listen to this album. The only good track is a David Bowie remake that isn't even listed. This CD was so bad that I threw it away--I wouldn't even give it to my enemies. Horrible, horrible...do yourself a favor, don't buy this album."
2,I Turned Out A Dud,"If you've never heard of BAD, this album will leave you wondering what the fuss was about. If you knew BAD back in the day, you're probably wondering `What the heck happened to BAD?' It's inexplicable, perhaps Mick Jones is simply too old to rock and roll. The album is summed up well by the track `I Turned Out A Punk', which is as unpunk a track as you can imagine, although it purports to be a statement of purpose. If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a joke, sadly, it is not. BAD were cool once, however, if you doubt, check out the superb THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE which was, in fact, audio dynamite, and still is. As for this album, well, BAD has become a has been."
5,Full of info and well laid out,This guide has so much information compressed onto a small space. It has enough info for a multi term course in the language.
3,Arrived timely and in great condition,The grammar chart is great quality but is VERY confusing. I tried studying from it and eventually just gave up.
2,"Great boots, but they don't last long","As another reviewer said, these are great boots in that they go on easily and stay on, but they wear out quickly. We have an active golden retriever and the boots stayed on no matter what he was doing. Unfortunately, I don't think we got more than about a dozen uses out of them before the sole of the boots disintegrated. Granted, some our walks were on roads with a combination of snow, sand and salt, but the sand and salt were part of the reason we wanted boots. These boots might hold up longer on a dog that was only out in the snow. I'm looking for a sturdier boot for our dog..."
3,Did what i needed them to but...,They feel kinda cheap to begin with. They are pretty thin but they did help save my dogs paws when hiking however they fell off four times within a two mile trip. The Velcro kept getting loose when my dog jogged. However i cant complain they did what i needed and I'm a happy customer.
2,Convenient but don't last long,"My small dog has been wearing these for just half an hour/day during his walk at the park. Easy to put on, soft, velcro keeps them in place. However, the soles are torn after just a month of use. Disappointed."
5,Remarkable stories and compelling analysis,"Once in a while you read a book that opens your eyes. This is one of those books: a compelling account of how women from virtually every class and race surmount convention to have children, provide them with richly supportive -- if often improvised -- home and family, and fill in the gaps they feel separate them from the ""normal"" family. Hertz has a gift for selecting the right stories to tell. She also produces a clear sociological analysis of those stories without being overbearing or jargonistic. This is a must for policymakers anxious to ""save the American family."""
2,More of a research paper,"As someone who is currently single and trying to become a mother, this is not a book I would recommend. I was looking for something a bit more practical and this read more like someone's thesis. Also, I didn't identify with many of the women profiled. Their reasons or the reasons given for choosing this path just didn't ring true for me.The one part of the book I enjoyed was hearing the different stories about how the women explained the ""fathers"" to the children. That was very helpful since I've been struggling with the story that I will tell."
5,Single Motherhood,Add another one to Hertz's Fan club! Her writing style and explanations of real life America have assisted us in understanding the thinking of today's women ...Her research shows that the family unit and the tradition of motherhood may be changing with the times but will continue to be maintained.These women contribute greatly to American society today and so does Rosanna Hertz. A book that must be read!
5,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Considering this costs upwards of 40 dollars elsewhere, if you can find it, I would say this is a great deal. It has a mini jack so you could hook up media speakers if you don't have a stereo reciever as I have done. Can also hook up a wireless headset.Very happy with the product. I had the boombox many years and it finally died. If you have good multimedia speakers I would recommend not buying the 100 dollar boombox. It's really a waste. This works fine."
5,Added versatility for my XM,Very simple to set up and use. Allows me to connect my XM to my shop radio (Milwaukee) auxiliary jack and listen to all of the XM programming. SKYFI2 is no longer carried by best Buy and also got a great price at Amazon.
5,Good Product,Although I have the Boom Box which gives good service I wanted to play my XM Radio through my surround sound system. The Home Adapter Kit was easy to hook up and the whole system is working great. If you have a good sound system and want to enjoy XM Radio at its best I recommend the Home Adapter Kit.
2,First product did not work,"This product was purchased as a X-mas gift for my parents. When they tried to get it up and running, the XM radio would not turn on. Thinking that it was the stereo itself, we replaced that. We soon found out that it was the home adapter kit that was not working. When I contacted the company about an exchange they were not helpful at all. I was told that I needed to ship it back to them, which ended up costing me more than the actual product ($10.00). When I called the Satelight Radio store, they were rude and could not offer any other options. They told me that there was NOTHING that could be done for me regarding the malfunctioning product or the shipping costs. I sent it back a week ago and am still waiting for the new product to arrive."
5,SKYFi2 Home Adapter,The home adapter is actually much easier than the directions show. I laid the antenna on an inside window sill and the sound was perfect. The total installation was only 5 minutes and the sound quality is fantastic.
3,overpriced,"Although this unit does what it says, it is way too much money, as is my monthly subscription to XM."
2,Poor Reception,"I have not been able to receive stations, other than the advertisments.I get a good signal, and can hear the talking. I don't think my account has been activated. I have written to Delphi, and never get a live person!I have e mailed them and never get a reply. I probably need a professional to install this tuner."
4,Awesome!,"I saw the band live, and bought the CD. It is awesome, and I listen to it all the time! If you get a chance to see them, go! Otherwise, buy the CD, you won't be disappointed!"
1,Not believing this one...,"From a style viewpoint, the writing is at quite a low level. You get the feel that the author is trying to ""talk"" to you, but it is unconvincing. On top of this, there seem to be logical flaws to the story being told by the author (which he claims to be true). One of the flaws that stands out in my mind begins with a character in the book who is recalling a past life. The character is speaking through this past life persona in the first person, yet refers to the year as some date with a B.C. attached to the end of it. How would ""someone"" living in this era ever know to refer to the year as B.C. Nice try Weiss."
1,What a bunch of tripe,"Wow. This book was really something. Highly suggestible people being lead to ""regress"" to past lives by a ""Doctor"". I tried to have an open mind, I really did. But this is too much."
2,I'm suspicious about this one.,Brian Weiss says that he cannot reveal the true identity of 'Elizabeth' and 'Pedro' because of patient confidentiality. Fair enough. But what is stopping them from revealing themselves? What about the fame and fortune and celebrity status that would go with such an amazing story? People would kill to get on the Oprah show for a lot less.
5,Only Love is Real,"'Another beautiful 'Crown Jewel' for Dr. Brian Weiss. A must read for everybody that 'thinks' that love 'feels' good. Words full of wisdom and clarity; hope and understanding about the true and deepest meaning of life itself and its eternal relationships. Life it's a never ending process, and we are never alone. It's not a matter of 'If' (you will find your soulmate), but only a matter of 'When'. Read this book, you will feel different when you finish it. I promise. A.B-"
4,Wonderful,Wonderful!!!! Gives me so much to think about and to just... believe. Not much I can say right now except that I am totally loving all Dr. Weiss's books =) His insights are phenomenal and information priceless! These books will come to those when it is meant to be... as it is with me
4,only love is real,"fast delivery and nice book to read. if you are interested in the after-life and/or reincarnation, i would recommend this book to you."
4,Interresting,"The book made me think about a lot of things I had never thought about before. Very interresting but perhaps a little too much repeating because I had read Many Lives, Many masters by the same author.Still I do recommend the book!"
5,Loved it!,"One of my favorite books of all times. Refreshing, interesting, romantic. I love all of Brian Weiss' books, they always leave me with so many questions, but also so many answers. Highly recommend it."
3,A book about a couple's past lives,"I loved reading this book as it was quite easy to read, and very interesting. I think this is the first book that I read so fast.It's mainly about the author's two patients past lives, and how they intertwined with one another, and finally got back together after so many years of being apart through time and space.This book made me believe in ""past-life regression therapy,"" and most importantly that there is a possiblity of one having past lives. Overall I loved this book, but at times I wish it had more details, and the story ended quite abruptly. But I would definitely recommend it to others. Enjoy the book!!"
5,The most profound book I have ever read.,"This was the first book I read on regression therapy, and it won't be the last! It literally changed the way I view life and it has started me on a search of my past lives.I have read all his books and not only recommended them to many people, but have also written a college term paper on the subject.Thank you Brian for sharing your discoveries!<BR"
4,Fascinating,"Let me see once again that NOTHING HAPPENS BY ACCIDENT....that every thing has a reason to be or not to be...For complete your reading, I advise you to read ""Journey of souls"" written by Dr. Newton"
4,"Only Love is Real,But Its painful Too................","-Ok.This is another book by Brian Weiss,After Many Lives,Many Masters.I cant say book is written very well or content is 100% new.It Could've been written better.I was expected more from Brian Weiss.But still book touches heart because of its real love story of soulmates.Weiss explains that it is not neccesarry that we will meet our soulmate in every lifetime.Also it is not neccesarry that they will be our lover only.Soulmates can come in your life as anyone,your father,mother,friend,your daughter or anyone.Assuaring fact is that you will reunite with your soulmate whether it takes 50,100,1000 or 2000 years.Your spirit will recognise them by looking into their eyes.You will be one again.Because only love is Real.There are some Messeges given by Masters which teaches us the lesson we need to learn & they are Wonderful."
4,Is there such a thing as a soul mate?,"Dr. Weiss has done it again. In ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" he shares his introduction to reincarnation with us. In ""Only Love Is Real"" he takes this a step further to show how we must complete any unfinished business with relationships from our past. It's fascinating to find one person regressed to a specific lifetime. To find two that share the same memories from different perspectives is incredible. And the fact that their current lifes do in some way mirror the old, just proves the karma or cause and effect theory. This is a great book for people looking for insights into their own relationships which probably also have ties to the past as well as those looking for a soulmate. Another book I recommend to those looking for soulmate material is the novel, ""The Destiny of Miro"" which has at its core, a soulmate relationship that spans two lifetimes."
4,Reveal the true love,"Though it is not a new release but I found it in a bookshop accidentally. Finished the whole book in a 12 hours flight and really can't put it down. It just reminded me something that everybody in this world will find his/her special one, it is just a matter of time. The message in this book told me the love, confidence and patience, even in our toughest time. I kept my book in my bookshelf and read it from time to time, and everytime, I can say, it gave me a strong reassurance to love."
3,Could've been better written,"I've always loved books that illustrate true-life synchronicity and its wonders. I found ONLY LOVE IS REAL's story of Elizabeth and Pedro to be fascinating. It did not excite me as much as I hoped it would though. It's all in the presentation. I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat and could very well have put the book down if it weren't such a quick read.Nevertheless, pick up a copy if you are into reincarnation. While you're at it, you might also want to check out Dr. Bruce Goldberg's PAST LIVES, FUTURE LIVES. In this more enthralling book is a case very, very similar to (yet MARKEDLY different from) Weiss's Pedro and Elizabeth."
4,Interesting past life love story.,"This book is very interesting and the case in this book is about the freak of nature where two solemate share many past life and bla bla bla........ Well the only complaint I have is that Weiss add so many comments of his old work in between that I felt that the soulmate case is really very short, well I think that if this is your first read of Weiss' books that don't gonna bother you. it's all about marketing right?."
5,amazing,This book was so inspiring to me. I love the way it details the growth of the two people. The doctor is also on a path of spiritual learning and is open minded.Nothing is more real than love of the heart. I want to go see the writer !
5,Great read!,"A great follow-up to Many Lives, Many Masters! This is a must-read for anyone curious and wanting to learn more about reincarnation."
5,Outstanding!,"This book does not carry as much stories of Reicarnation as the first one did. But the messages from the Masters are as clear, inspiring, and life changing as they could be. Just read read trough page 65 about the message Dr. Weiss received while in a deep state of meditation. Whenever I feel down or consumed by lifes difficulties I just read this powerful message of hope and understanding and everything turns out fine. I definetely recommended to everyone."
2,NO Good!!,"These are terrible, broke 2 pairs, both at the butt end of the stick in the last 6 months. I had to replace the sleeves every week, and they make your toms sound dead. If you have ever done any marching you probably know what a ""dead"" stick is. This feels like a dead stick straight out of the box. The only reason I tried two pairs is because I go through wood sticks like crazy and thought this was better for my wallet but after 60 bucks on the sticks, $4 a week on sleeves, and the constant headache of the sound and feel, they are not worth it. Yeah they might feel good and last long on an electric kit but so do #2 pencils.Also, just for reference, I play hard but I only play two times a week for about 4 hours a day at my church. It's not like I'm playing speed metal 7 days a week."
3,A little too long and very focused on Quantas,"This book was pretty good, there is a lot of focus around a class given by Quantas, that you are not attending by reading the book and I found that part boring. There is still some good flying information out there for the fearful fliers, but I kind of felt while reading this, that I was reading an advertisement for the class...that I wasn't attending.All around not a bad book, and I found all the statistics interesting."
3,I need all the help I can get,"It was odd for me to have to get the Fearless Flyer's Handbook from an American bookstore as the book originated in the state I live in. In the matter of being too scared to fly, this book is helping me. I haven't finished reading it yet, but so far it has managed to make feel not alone in my plight. I once read that to get over something, like anxiety, you must read all there is to know and more on the subject - so that is what I'm doing and YES it is helping. This book has testimonials in it from airline professionals that detail parts of their working life, which eases my mind about the prospect of flying. Importantly, I learned that a lot of people who fear flying have all this other stuff going on in their lives that they need to deal with, which has triggered their fear - that was me - I had an alcohol-induced, sleep-deprived panic attack on a flight that had nothing to do with the plane. And many issues to work through - this was a big eye-opener."
2,Not a Whole Lotta Help,"Although not an uninteresting exploration of many of the aspects of flying, this book does not seem likely to truly alleviate many of the fears of the uncertain flier. It is one thing to understand the mechanics of flying, but quite another to get detailed descriptions of emergency procedures when something goes wrong. Those of us who suffer or have suffered bouts of unnecessary white-knuckled flying want to know how the plane stays in the air, why it is unlikely that something will go wrong and what all those noises and sensations are that may set us off. We also want to know what is going on in the cockpit during a normal flight, since most of us realize that once we've landed, we've once again experienced a normal flight...There are much better books than this one if you want to conquer any fear of flying....END"
2,Skip it,"As an American, I found the information based on Australian air travel to be irrelevant. Perhaps for an Australian it would be helpful. Would recommend ""Flying Without Fear"" by Duane Brown, Ph.D. instead."
4,Haitink's digital late 80's cycle w/Concertegebouw on Philips,"Symphonies 4 and 8 of Haitinks cycle remain consistent with ""middle of the road"" interpretations. Well played, well recorded, some mild echo. No new interpretive ground, lacking in electricity, but that smooth Concertegebouw sound is nice. Tempos are conventional. However, to have a 4/8 in your collection, this disc will never offend. Especially this 4th had good musical definition. His 3rd is very middle ground, with nice dynamics. The 5th is well played, but conventional. 7th symphony is bland and well played. So for a nicely played, good recording set, but no better than that, anyone desiring a pleasant and uncontroversial set of the Mighty nine could select the whole set or individual symphonies. For ""higher voltage"" recordings audition the classic Kleiber 5/7, Karajans BPO Telemondial Eroica, Giulini's gorgeous 6th on Sony, Norringtons period instrument 1/2."
4,Never laughed so hard!!,"I spat out what I was drinking watching him look for the baby mama! This is hysterical! And the baby talking, pure fun! This is the first time seeing Jang Geum Suk in a comedy. What a treat!! On my Wish list to buy shortly. Christmas gift, anyone?!!"
3,Well acted,This was just a sweet story about learning to love and how responsibility changes you. The baby was simple and sweet and I'm a fan of the actor.
2,soup opera drama,"Sorry, but this movie was very lousy. The acting was a soup opera style and the plot was aimed to teenagers. Not my cup of tea. Having seen other Asian comedies, this one is just overrated by Amazon viewers. Do not recommend this one."
4,Two different versions,"Hmm. I got this CD back when it was first released - but it had a different set of songs. (Look at the customer image from T. Butler, above). The version I have has ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", ""Love Child"", ""Grazing in the Grass"", and ""Born to Be Wild"" which seem to have been replaced with ""Tighten Up"", ""(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay"", ""People Got to Be Free"", and ""Chain of Fools"". I wonder why the changes.I also have 1971 and 1972 which seem to be unchanged..."
3,An Interesting Group of Songs,"When you're looking for that one particlular 60's song, this series isn't too bad. I bought this CD for ""Sittin' On The Dock Of The Bay"", but was pleasantly surpised to get ""Chain of Fools"", ""Green Tambourine"" and ""The Horse"" which is a song my band used to play in the 70's."
3,Teen Show,"I have not seen the show yet ( I saw some pictures and a promo a long time ago ), but I just want to say one thing. This dvd does not contain the second season, but contains the second part of the first season, dvd released a few months ago. So buyers are not confused."
4,Secret Life - Season 2,"I watch this show and even though it gets a little soap opera-ish, I still like to watch it. It talks a lot about sex, sometimes too much, but in high school I understand where they are going with it with teenage pregnancy so high and shows on TV promoting it....."
1,what secret?,"The ""secret"" life of the American teenager is very misleading; there are virtually NO secrets in this series. Virtually EVERY scene in this entire series concerns sex, sexual orientation, and devious machinations perpetuated by the main characters in an effort to get the person they want into their arms and ultimately into their beds. I have taught teenagers for years, and sex is rarely mentioned. Even when I was a teen, I discussed it w/ my friends, but it wasn't even top 5 on the list. This show is nothing but a treatise on sex, being gay, and nothing more. Very shallow show and it's as if every character thinks they're gay and only thinks about sex. The only interesting characters are the peripheral ones whose motives aren't entirely known. Too, what is ""secret"" about the show? Every character spills their guts to someone and w/in a couple scenes, every character on the show is in on the ""secret.""Watch a show w/ some depth. This is not that show!"
5,DVD,My daughter loves this TV series. Would continue to buy the remaing set. No cons. Pros very entertaining. Good choice.
4,LOVE,I love dealing with them. I got my dvds in a reasonable amount of time and was able to watch them shortly after that. the only thing I didn't like is that I bought 2 seasons and they charged me S&H for both separately instead of putting them together.
5,"Excellent,","I will definately order from this seller again. Perfect condition, more than fair price and very fast delivery. Great!!!"
4,Much better than the first!,"After seeing the first season of the show on both TV and DVD there was something about it that kept my interest. When Season 2 never aired in Canada, I was anxious for the dvd release. I pre-ordered it and it arrived last week. So far, I have watched the first two episodes of the season and they were funnier, warmer, more interesting and all around much better than the first 11 episodes of the first season. I hope season 2 continues to be just as good!"
1,The person ho sent me this really screwed up.,"The DVDS were cracked and would not play, they cost me $40 and when i asked for a refund for the unplayable DVDS he would not give me one. I would not buy from this seller."
5,An Excellent Resource,"My eye was surgically removed 11 months ago because of a tumor (melanoma) behind the eye. This book was very helpful to me and very encouraging. You quickly figure out some of the things in the book on your own but it's nice to have someone give you pointers on the things that don't come naturally. I still look through the book occasionally and find useful information. As another reviewer indicated, you can get this book for $21, shipping and handling included. Just search the book's title. If you've recently lost an eye you've had enough trauma....no need to pay more than $100 for this. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great for the imagination,"This is my favorite Seuss book. As a child I knew there was no 1st of Octember, but I loved to imagine all the things I would ask for and get if that day really existed."
2,"Eh, not the most interesting...",It's making your kid think they can have anything they want...and encourages the wrong behavior. I just have to say it that I've seen better by Seuss
2,gimme,"I bought this book for my daughter because I remembered it as a fun book from when I was a kid. I was horrified to read through it when it arrived; just about every page has the word ""want"" on it. This is the last thing I want to teach my daughter--give me something because I want it. It's the American mentality of entitlement. When I read the book to my daughter (only on request), I always skip the pages with the boy writing out his wish list and the truck delivering it all. Sure, it's OK to dream, but I'd rather my daughter not learn to dream about 'getting ""stuff""/getting everything she _wants_.' Why is having ""stuff"" so important? I think we should be teaching our kids real values."
3,This book has a troubling theme ...,"There are a handful (less than 5) of the Dr. Seuss books that go overboard on imagination, and this is one of them (some others are, ""Happy Birthday to You!"", and ""Oh, the thinks you can think!"") So for visual imagery and imagination, this is a wonderful book.That being said, however, nobody has addressed the moral problem raised by this book, e.g., the parent is trying to ""mis-direct"" a child's wants to some day in the future (that does not exist) when all their wants and needs will be satisfied all at once - On the first of Octember!My wife grew up dirt poor in a foreign country. She did not think very much of this book.Imagine reading the book to your child, shutting the book, and fielding a question, ""Mommy (or Daddy), when is the First of Octember ???"" If you can field this question adequately, then go ahead and buy the book."
2,Qui Gon Jin Action Figure,"I honestly hated this toy. I was told it was fully poseable, but opened the package to find that infact, it could only be put into about 3 positions. The package even says ""FULLY POSEABLE"", I fell that this toy is to pricy to have basicly no articulation."
4,A Gorgeous Album In Primitive Stereo,"This is one of the most joyous and intuitive albums the Ames Brothers ever produced.It has a spontanaeity (even though close harmony is usually anything but spontaneous) that is lacking in other artists' Yuletide offerings.It also has the curiosity of the mid-late 50s stereo - the Brothers are recorded distinctly to the Left of the sound stage while the instruments are largely on the opposite side - either fascinating or irritating, depending on your point of view. It was a practice that was ceased by the early 60s."
3,"sometimes jazzy, sometimes insipid.","I remember the Ames Brothers' take on ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" from one or more of my parents' late 1960s or early '70s freebie gas-station Christmas LPs. It was always a favorite. Several tunes (including that one) on this CD bring back that free-wheeling, hip take on Christmas, but at least as many are trashy and saccharine. ""C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S"" and ""There'll Always Be a Christmas"" make we want to hurl, but ""Jingle Bells"" and, of course ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" make me want to dance around the living room again like I did when I was five!"
1,Yoga Book,"As yet I have not received the item, hence I am unable to supply you with a review. I had intended to contact Amazon today for help to track the item as a tracking number has not been supplied. With thanks Bronwyn"
5,Magic in plates and places,It is easy to make me want to travel to all the places so beautifully described in this book. But making me want to cook is nothing short of magic: this book accomplishes that as no other cook book ever has. The thrill of picturing the places where the food originated while chopping and cooking makes each meal an experience rather than a chore. Thanks.
4,Must have as a supplement to Thai language material,"""A picture says a thousand words"". . . This book has thousands of pictures! This book is a handy reference for English people who are studying the Thai language or vice versa.I believe it is a bit unwieldy for the casual traveller/visitor.I have a strong desire to learn Thai and I have purchased quite a bit of English<->Thai material over the years...most of the material is 1970s and earlier. . .This ""dictionary"" (manual?) is recent and has really tickled my fancy. I will buy this book for some of my Thai & English friends...Two thumbs up!"
5,Really cute,"What else is there to say? It's frogs, for goodness sake. How can you not like frogs? Buy one today!"
3,interesting,"This one was pretty good, but not as good as the first books in the series were(Heir to the Force, etc.)but it was still okay. I thought that there could have been a little more interaction between Tenel Ka and Jacen, and Jaina and Zekk. Also, why wasn't Mara in this book? Didn't Anderson and Moesta read Vision of the Future? They should have, if they were writing in this universe. All in all, the book was okay."
5,The BEST!!!! Anderson and Moesta dont stop now!!!,"More Jacen and Jaina!!!! Dont leave us hangin Anderson and Moesta!!!! Write at least one more trilogy!!! Well I hope for all you people who have not read the final installment of the ""Anja Gallandro"" trilogy that you put it as a MUST for your Christmas list. This is for any avid Star Wars YJK or JJK fan. GREAT JOB GUYS!!!!!"
5,a very exciting book,"This is the first long Star Wars book I ever read and I was quite impressed. With Anja Gallendro's growing addiction to andris spice she decides to steal Zekk's ship THE LIGHTNING ROD to go and get more spice from Kessel. Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, Lowbacca and Zekk decide to go after her to stop her spice addiction and get Zekk's ship back. When they get to Kessel they learn that the administraitor has had a assasination attempt on him and Anja has left to Mon Calanmari. Leaving Jaina & Lowbacca to watch over the administrator. When the rest of the gang arrives at Mon Calamari they meet with the Jedi healer/ambassador they meet Anja and decide to destroy the evil Czethros (who smuggles andris spice) spice hideaway under the ocean. But Czethros has landed troops on Kessel for a takeover,and only Jaina & Lowbacca stand in his way! The book is exciting with lots of action. I recomend it to all Star Wars readers."
5,Excellent!,Excellent book! Well written! Well worth reading! Also read her book/bio expose of the Mormons...it is excellent as well...she is/was a professor & writes very well!
5,I've been saying it all along....,"This book says everything I have thought for the past 20 years (and no one else seemed to understand). It is such a relief to know that I am not the only woman aware of the paradoxical rolls placed on women in our society. The advent of the Women's Rights movement opened new opportunities for women but also placed them in dual, incompatible rolls that tear women apart. This book explains all of that and gives hope that our society will eventually recognize this dilemma and discover ways out of the breaking point."
2,Rather odd title indeed.,"PN1: Hey it's person number two!!PN2: You haven't hit puberty yet?PN1: Yeah well at least you have a wife, I'm just boning some old lady.WIFE: Hey, be nice!!!PN2: Ah well it's all good. Hey weren't you guys heading to Milan or something?PN1: We were but the wife is pregnant, so...OLD LADY: Oh you look so cute with yer pregnancy!!!There. I just wrote every joke in the film, and saved you some money that could be spent on a GOOD movie."
2,Ouch!,"I'm really losing faith in films I think. I just watched this with my wife and had to keep looking over at her to see if we were really watching it. I just felt like it skipped from on disconnected slapstick skit to the next. Sure, there's a good cast of actors whom are considered funny.... but it's almost as if they hoped that fact alone would be enough to get them by. Plot? Oh no, you shall not find that here. Just two hours of fart jokes."
2,New Low Point for Sandler,"Slapping Rob Schneider in the face with a dehydrated banana to make people laugh? Has it come to this?Let me say that I wanted to like this movie, I needed the laughs. However I was utterly disappointed. A movie full of cliches, and one dimensional characters. The big black grandma with bunions who farts incessantly?!Surely, you can't expect much from most of this cast, but even Adam Sandler fails miserably. If you watched the preview, I would like to point out that those thirty seconds are the highlights of the movie. Other than that give this movie a pass."
1,Funny how it made it to theatres.,"Most times it was painful to watch and I just wanted to get away. The jokes were not funny at all. Adam Sandler keeps telling the nanny to study, oh yeah, get out those books and study for the big test. It wasn't funny the first time, so why would it be funny the fifth time?It's very lame to see: a child drink milk from his mother, have children say stuff just for shock effect, have people fall or crash into buildings, the hot daughters, etc.The plot of the movie is family, keeping the family together,etc. You just have to trudge through very lame jokes and bad acting until you finally get to the plot. Yes, I admit, there were a few GREAT laughs though, but just a few, very few.The movie was just a weekend in the life of a bunch of long-time friends. Overall, wasn't funny or exciting or interesting, but in the end, it had a good ""message"" to tell its audience about appreciating what you have in life."
1,This is a a very dumb movie!,This is really a BAD movie! We tried to like it but it really was awful! Nothing is orginal! They use bodily functions throughout the movie...real classy!Dont waste 2 hours on this one!
1,Lame and boring,"How five so-called stars could get together and come up with such a turkey is something of a mystery. The main problem is that it's so poorly written. My wife and I sat through the entire thing, and neither one of us laughed once. We did emit a considerable number of groans, though, at the lame attempts at humor and poorly contrived dialog. But, come to think of it, Spade is still trying to live down ""Joe Dirt,"" Sandler hasn't done anything really funny since ""Anger Management,"" Schneider is a constant embarrassment, Rock has never lived up to his potential, and James is just that annoying guy on ""King of Queens."" Maybe it's not so mysterious after all."
3,"Funny movie, but similar to other ones","I thought this movie would be hilarious having all the funniest guys from this decade in it. It was funny, but it didn't give me as much laughter as I thought it would. There are only a few funny moments which I thought the whole movie would be, but most of it wasn't that funny. I'm a pretty good rater on movies here, it's just this movie didn't meet my expectations."
3,Grown Ups,"I found it to be an Okay movie that was worth watching once,It has a good family feel to it and you have the Usual guys employed by Sandler who for some reason they don't pull it off as well in this movie.It seemed dry and Selma Hayek despite her beautiful looks is quite annoying,the movie could have been a lot better and a lot funnier."
2,Pretty CRAPPY,Wow - I wanted it to be better since I really like a lot of the actors in this movie. I chuckled about three times. Don't waste your time.
2,2 Hours of My Life Down the Drain,"As a huge Adam Sandler fan I had high hopes for this film. The movie is full of big names, but unfortunately they forgot to bring the big jokes. The funniest part of this movie occured at the 60 minute mark when I removed it from my blu-ray player and threw it out the window. Maybe if this event was in the movie it would have been funnier, but somehow I doubt it! Better luck next time Adam."
2,Not a kids movie,"This was an OK movie, different than the action movies, but I was ready for a switch. The lady at the video store told me this was a great kids movie. I went into this with high expectations and thus I was disappointed. I had my kids watch it with us and I was upset. During the movie the busy mom confesses that she is the tooth fairy and will put money under the pillow for her daughter. I had a lot of explaining to do. Luckily I have The Rock to thank for building up their beliefs in the Tooth Fairy. This movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be, but it was entertaining. I would rate it average, but because of the language and the tooth fairy comments, I am rating it only at two stars. I would try a different movie rather than this one."
1,Oh why Oh why did I waste two hours of my life on this.,"I actually came into this movie with high hopes, and boy was I wrong. You would think that with all those comedians in one movie that they could come up with something that was more funny then a fat man squashing a bird. I would rather watch documentary on the letter Q then watch this movie. It actually makes me physically sick to think about how much time I had to spend at work to pay for this movie. I want my time and money back!!!"
2,whens the sequel?,"This move is not one of the best adam sandler movies....... Happy gilmore or Billy madison could be a close runner up, and the wedding singer is topps. BUT, it does have some laughs and it is sweet... U remember when you were a kind kind of movie... two stars, its a rent, not a buy."
4,worth a watch,Some of the other reviews i have read look like these people are expecting a life changing movie. This movie wasn't a let down nor was it a stellar comedic performance. some of the jokes made me bust out laughing. Overall its worth a watch but don't expect some movie like happy gilmore or billy madison.
4,Grown Ups,I thought it was a good movie that showed how friends will stick together even after they become parents and have kids of their own. Some of the crazy things they did are things that do happen in everyday life and that's what makes it so funny.
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"GROWN UPS, was ok i have high hopes and laughs for these comendians and they didn't give em. i had a few chuckles but it was nothing to stay interested in the film, if you want this get it cheap or rent it."
5,Love this movie,"I loved this movie. The casting was great. All the characters were lovable and it reminded me of how I grew up as a kid. I thought it was definitely entertaining for people of all ages but especially those of us that grew up in a time where there were no computers, no cell phones, and we had to come up with our own games to entertain us. (without getting killed)It's an enjoyable, entertaining movie with a happy ending and it promotes spending time together as a family and the importance of good friends. What more could you ask for?? I highly recommend this movie. I saw it twice and I can't wait to see it again."
2,"A Good time, if you're Sandler and his friends","If you enjoyed seeing Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade and Chris Rock together in the 90's on SNL, then I recommend, just watching their old SNL skits again. In Grown Ups they obviously enjoy hanging out and making each other laugh since that's all the movie is about. They might as well have just recorded themselves unscripted hanging out and released it as a movie.While the funny Kevin James is just wasted in all these Happy Madison movies as their new fat clumsy guy. Don't get me wrong, Chris Farley was hilarious, if you don't believe me, watch his SNL skits. But even he would have been wasted in this movie, even though he would have enjoyed hanging out with his buddies. The material is just flat though and these guys made each other laugh, more than they made me laugh."
2,Who wrote the jokes for this movie??! Not funny at all!,"Who wrote the jokes for this movie? The jokes were like written for the 1920's or something. Very banal humor. I think whomever wrote the jokes were high or giddy (or both) and thought they would be funny because they were in such a giddy mood. If you like smart, zingy, perverted, or witty humor...then this is NOT the movie for you to watch. I guess they put all these ""funnymen"" together and thought the laughs would be handed to them. No wonder they were pushing this release so hard with all the actors promoting it on talk shows and NBA games...because it was a desperate move. Don't even rent this movie....you won't be able to get a laugh through the whole movie."
4,Overall pretty funny,"I watched this movie with the wifey while looking for a good comedy for our night together. Overall, we both enjoyed it and it put us in a very festive mood. Adam Sandler is funny as always."
2,Pretty low brow humor,"The movie's humor is clearly meant for a lowbrow audience. If that is what you are into, then this is your movie."
1,"Great movie, terrible quality","I love the movie Grown ups, and was very excited to watch it from Amazon. However, the quality was absolutely terrible!!!!! You could barely see the faces of the characters due to the fuzziness of the screen. It gave me a headache, so I turned it off. $6.99 wasted!"
3,Thought it would be better...,"With all the great actors in this, one would think it would be better. But that just isn't true. I am sorry I wasted time and money on this one."
3,mediocre,"it's not a horrible movie, but it's not that great either. It's got a few chuckles and some stupid attempts to be funny too. I figure, bored on a saturday night, it helped kill an hour and a half. It's the definition of mediocre."
1,So boring,"It's bad, so very very bad. If I were held at gunpoint and forced to choose between watching this movie again or standing in line at the DMV all day for no reason, I'd be on my way to the DMV. At least something interesting MIGHT happen there. This movie is the next chapter in the Magical Mystery Tour school of film which states, ""It we splice together two hours of famous people standing around on camera doing absolutely nothing, people will pay to see it."" Watching this will be the proverbial 2 hours of your life that you will grieve that you never get back. If you must watch it, bring something to keep you entertained."
1,OMG! What a waste of talent!!,"They have the funniest bunch of comedians and they totally wasted them. The story was weak and odd. Its like they wanted to do too much with all the characters. They couldnt stay with one storyline and make a strong movie. This movie totally sucked. There was only like 4 or 5 parts that made me laugh. They couldve done so much more with the 5 main male characters bonding at the lake house and go from there. Salma Hayek was awful in her role. BAD casting. She had no chemistry with Sandler or anyone else. Very random choice. The kids were cute though. The part at the end with the basketball game rivalry was retarded. It also didnt make sense that they were all so into their coach that they would take his ashes from his niece and scatter them. I ve never seen anyone that close to their coach. One of the worst Sandler movies ever. Makes Mall Cop look interesting, and that movie was a complete wreck."
1,ADAM SANDLER: Please learn how to wear clothes that fit!!!!!!!,"i thought that this may be mindless entertainment, it wasn't.the plot was so thin, and the jokes SO USED and NOT FRESH...it may have been funny 20 years ago, maybe... but humor has evolved...- and SOMEBODY PLEASE learn to dress Adam Sandler- he just looks STUPID in the 5XL clothing. SERIOUSLY STUPID! The ""oversized"" look doesn't work on him, or anyone- and it has gotten worse with age- he doesn't need to dress like that- and it just doesn't work!"
1,What a Let-Down!,"My phone rang just as I was putting this movie into the player. I told my sister what I was about to watch and I have to admit... SHE WARNED ME!!! How could a movie with such a great cast of comedians be so boring and NOT funny??? I kept watching in hopes that it would pick up the pace and get better. It did not. What a let-down. The ""jokes"" were immature and often crude. Apparently, the cast of 40-something year old men still thinks that ""fart"" jokes and the like are funny."
1,Slow and Uncomfortable,"I had hopes that this movie would be good. It was slow, uncomfortable, predictable, gross, etc. The geriatric girlfriend, the farting overbearing mother in law, a nursing four year old, the fugly daughter, the over the top spoiled children of main character Lenny Feder..It was really a bad movie."
1,Adam this movie sucks don't you get it?,"Adam is the nicest guys I'd ever met. but, this movie is trash. Billy Madison,Big Daddy,Happy Gilmore, Water Boy etc.. are way better than this movie. did not find it funny. so, he I go. trading it on Amazon for credit. (I am going by what people said. I never watched it) brand new last Christmas DVD being traded for credit."
5,Grown Ups DVD,"THIS DVD IS GREAT. THE ACTORS ALL DO A GREAT JOB. GROWN UPS IS THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO. IT'S VERY FUNNY. NOW DAY AND TIME WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE, GREED AND HORROR IN MOVIES AND REAL LIFE THIS MOVIE IS NEEDED. I HOPE THAT THIS CAST CONTINUES TO MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS. I KNOW THIS MOVIE WON'T WIN ANY AWARDS BUT THAT DOES'NT MATTER, WE NEED MOVIES LIKE THIS. I WATCH THIS MOVIE ON TV EVERY TIME I FIND IT AND HAVE WATCHED THE DVD AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK SCENTS I BOUGHT IT. THIS MOVIE TAKES ME AWAY FROM EVERYTHING THATS HAPPENING NOW AND MAKES ME LAUGH AND REMEMBER MY CHILD HOOD AND MY EARLY YEARS AS AN ADULT. IT'S WELL WORTH WHAT I PIAD FOR IT."
1,pretty bad,"basically, it was not a good Adam Sandler comedy. Good cast of actors, but bad producing and story line. The movie kept going and going and didnt get any better. It was almost awkward to watch it was so bad"
5,Grown Ups,"Although I ordered this as a gift, I did not preview the movie, but Adam Sandler and Kevin James are great in anything they do, and was informed this was a great movie"
3,Adam Sandler with his usual stuff,Adam Sandler with his usual stuff. Chris Rock in a v ery limited role. Chris shopuld have been better utili
4,Very good,I enjoyed this movie a lot. Just the right combination of funny antics and storyline. Recommended to anyone who wants a nice movie to sit back and enjoy.
4,Definitely funny... no where near as bad as the negative reviews here,"I enjoyed it... it is more of a character movie than a straight up comedy... its funny because it is actually quite life like with its group of guys getting together and constantly ripping on each other while remembering stories and situations from their youth. It is actually quite authentic to how my group of friends operates... my family and I laughed through it constantly. I think, if you liked a goofy but fun/funny movie like The Hangover or Hot Tub Time Machine, you should like this as well... if you didn't like those, you probably won't like this one either."
1,Unralistic and overwhelmingly borring.,"Adam Sandler has the worst taste in humor. The only good movie he every made was ""50 First Dates""In this movie no characters fit their unrealistic part.NOT RECOMMENDED"
1,I literally wanted to pull my skin out,"As a fan of most Adam Sandler movies, I expected to greeted with a mindless movie with a few laughs, a few chuckles, and a few good attempts but 'swing and misses.' Unfortunately, this was one of the most unbearable movies I have ever watched. Every scene tries to weave a little 'humor' into it, but falls flat on its face. I cannot believe a director saw this script and thought it would make for a funny movie. I cannot believe that 3 talented comedians (Sandler, Rock & James) actually agreed to make this movie after reading it over. It is not even worth the comedic value of a bad movie. It is TERRIBLE and at least one of the top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your time or money."
3,This movie hasn't grown up,"Grown Upsisn't half bad as far as these movies go, and I like its emphasis on family. However, the humor inGrown Upsis just really odd and random at times. Not infrequently, there will be something that's supposed to be funny, but just isn't (like an old black grandmother farting). The biggest problem with the movie though is that it seems rushed. It was heading towards an interesting confrontation, but all of the tension is resolved within a few minutes and a group conversation. It's almost like the director felt like he had to include some plot twists, but didn't really know what to do with them. The kids are cute though and have some of the best lines."
4,funny movie....,"If you are looking for something to entertain you without having to think too much, they this is the perfect movie. This is worth your while."
3,So So,"I love Kevin James and Adam Sandler, while they were funny in this film it was still just ""okay"". Not something I would ever bother to watch twice so not worth owning it. The funniest parts were already in the previews and it dragged on toward the end."
2,Grown Ups,"This movie had some potential. It could have been a comedy version of ""The Big Chill"" or similar retrospective movie. Several old friends get together after a common link to their pasts died. After the funeral they gather for a weekend of catching up and reviewing their lives. This is a good idea for a film. It could have been sentimental or it could have been introspective. Instead it was stupid.No part of it was really all that funny, though several people in the theater with me were laughing hysterically. I couldn't really understand why. Adam Sandler is a dud as a movie maker. Kevin James tried to carry his share of the load, but failed. The others limp along through one irrelevant scene after another. The movie never really developed a plot, it just went along for a couple of hours then ended.I'm glad I saw this at the discount theater because anything else would have been a waste of money."
5,Laughed my head off,Laughed my head off. One of Sandlers best. Very funny buddy film. Should do more films like this.
2,Disappointed,"Very boring run-of-the-mill gags. I got the feeling they just made this movie to enjoy a vacation together. Bad writing, sentimental crap. I love many of the comics in the movie, it was just a sorry script."
3,Laughing at themselves,"The Adam Sandler's role is in a line with his usual business of screening a manipulative psycho-infant in a company of similar buddies this time as forty-year-old-plus school-mates and their families reunited at the funeral of their basketball coach.Regrettably, to many features, especially dealt with their modern kids, are shown realistically."
1,Worst Comedy I've Seen Since Cop Out,"My brother suggested this movie and I probably laughed once or twice throughout the movie. The only reason why I watched the whole thing was because my brother rented this damn movie for Thanksgiving!The movie is plagued with fart jokes and one-liners and worst of all, the jokes felt overly forced into the movie. Too many attempts to make the movie funny. For goodness sake, instead of cramming a lame joke every minute how about thinking up of one really good joke every few minutes!"
5,grown ups,must have been a gift - never watched it - it did arrive safely though - my nephew loved it.
1,Dang,"Worst movie I have ever seen. The movie is a little too dirty to be a kids movie but it sure seems like one. I can honestly say I'm embaressed I watched this two hour pile of crap. If you like fart jokes, pee jokes, or any other child like humor this is for you! If not the only other use for this dvd is to throw it in the air and shoot it with a shotgun. Dear Adam Sandler, I will NEVER watch a movie starring you again."
1,Don't Bother,"This movie isn't worth any amount of money. It isn't funny, well produced, or at all well thought out. Don't bother."
5,So happy I ignored some reviews on here and went for it!,"Ok... bottom line... if you grew up in a small neighborhood and played sports and you still have the same friends as you did when you were in grade school... this movie is for you. Anyone who gave this movie a bad review didn't have many friends growing up and have absolutely no sense of humor. This movie did not deserve 3 stars... it definitely deserves at least 4 but since I love the cast I gave it 5 stars. Grab a six-pack, set a date-night with your significant other, and relax... this movie will offer some laughs. Was it as funny as ""The Hangover"" probably not... but at least I could probably enjoy watching it with my 12 year old without feeling weird. Awesome movie, great cast!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I was told at work that this was a very funny film, and I was excited when it arrived in the mail. The film opens with the men as boys winning a basketball game. This scene was actually pretty funny, but the movie quickly turned south. As the men grew up they all went their separate ways. I found the characters to be disgusting. There wasn't a single one that I actually liked. The humor was stale. Plus, all the jokes were based on the humor of ripping on each other (meaning making fun of your friends by saying things that friends really shouldn't say to each other). The lines were delivered as if they reading off a cue card.This movie had all the makings of being a great film. Great cast, a funny group of men to write the thing, and a plot that afforded a lot of humor filled moments. Unfortunately they couldn't find the funny.Don't buy this film. Heck, don't even rent this film. It is time that you will never get back."
5,Absolutely hilarious!,"If you love Adam Sandler movies you MUST get this one. This is THE funniest one (in my opinion) yet. After finding out that his middle school basketball coach dies, Adam Sandler's charachter and his family meet up with the other teammates at the funeral and spends the weekend re-living those good old days at a cabin by the lake! Having children of their own now...they see how ridiculous things have become since they were kids and try to show their families how to have fun like they did. Great one-liners, lots of laughs and with Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, Kevin James and David Spade playing his childhood friends now all grown up----you can't go wrong!"
3,For Young & Old,"Grown Ups was almost universally panned when it was released. I have to admit I stayed away from the film based on the reviews. After watching the film, I found it highly entertaining and really a feel good story. Adam Sandler & crew are basically improvising throughout the film. This makes it seem like the audience is just watching in on a bunch of friends goofing on one another and having a good time. The only actor who doesn't seem to fit in is David Spade. He's the only lead in the cast who is single without a family and he seems like he is shoehorned in just to have him in the cast. I'm not a huge Adam Sandler fan, but Grown Ups is one of the few films of his that I found myself enjoying."
2,weak,"This show starts out with a few laughs, then turns inappropriate for the young, and cliche for the experienced. Included is a breast feeding 4 year old? Multiple threats and requests to kill a family pet and a seemingly unending string of derogatory remarks about someones wife who is supposed to be older than him (though the difference is hardly discernible). Suffice it to say the script is well beneath the capabilities of the participating actors. If any one shines it would be the nanny, in my opinion."
5,Cant get any better,Grown Ups reminds me of watching SNL in the 1980's. It makes me laugh every time I watch it. Plus you can not go wrong for the price.
3,"Not That Grown-Up, But Still Kind Of Funny","For a movie called ""Grown Ups"", this comedy was pretty juvenile. But that's what I want from a comedy, so that was okay. What wasn't okay, was that Grown Ups started off pretty darn funny, but just got tiresome after about the first half of the film. It probably would have been better off as a half hour sitcom than as a feature-length movie. And it was surprising to see Salma Hayek in this, considering that she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in Frida. Worth watching once, if you haven't quite grown up."
4,"Pardon me for being a little picky, but...","I am usually impressed by the remarkable detail McFarlane brings to the table, but I was not as pleased with this product as I had expected. The detail of the uniform is beautiful as usual, but I find that the large, obvious seam in the neck (I assume this to not be unique to my particular figurine) detracts from the overall appearance of the model. Also, I think the stripes on his shoes should be white..."
4,Great Work/Good Recording,This CD was a great guide as our choir was rehearsing this Requiem. The work itself is awe-inspiring and captures some wonderful feeling. The only disbenefit of this recording is that it is a little quiet and perhaps balanced too much toward the orchestra; perhaps this reflects my choral bias.
5,my love affair with modern art,This is a wonderful book. It consists of short vignettes about the author's interaction with artists she met in the course of her career as a curator at the Chicago Institute of Art and later as a gallery owner. Her insight and her ability to describe the artists are wonderful. The story about Edward Hopper was just great!!
3,Good description of an artsy fartsy world!,"Sometimes during my read of this book I would find myself asleep but you can be sure I kept coming back. I certainly have a new appreciation for K. Kuh's modern art world and since I was able to visit the Institute of Arts in Chicago it was practically nostalgic. I think sometimes one gets so much of an education that it pushes one beyond the basic human side and one forgets that inevitably everybody takes a dump. I never realized all of the politics and tedium involved with being a museum curator. I had to look up some big words which means it broadened my horizons; right? Maybe... I enjoyed reading this book, was a bit over the top and for a hard cover book I had hoped for more photos."
2,eh,"I didn't like this album, and barely listened to it. I don't know why...and wasn't particularly interested to figure out the reason or reasons."
5,check description very carefully,"We love this product! Well, as long as you get the right one. The pictures and descriptions for the product are all mixed up. The All TERRAIN Aloe Gel SKIN RELIEF is Paraben-Free. If you look closely at the pictures you will see the picture for it with the description of the SKIN REPAIR which is not. The picture for SKIN REPAIR is on the SKIN RELIEF product description I matched the tube pictures and received the wrong one because I didn't check the description closely enough. The SKIN REPAIR description says Paraben-Free, but the ingredients are correct and lists the parabens. They fixed it to my satisfaction when I called to return it. I just didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake. It would be hard to re-order with confidence here. The SKIN RELIEF is fabulous! We use it for tons of stuff. It's especially great on my son's eczema."
5,"Great Company, Great Prodcut","I'm a country born and bred guy and so hand lotion was just not my thing, but as I get older, I am finding that I would rather use this stuff than suffer the painful cracks that I get now and then from ranch work and other environmental abuse I cause my hands on a daily basis. I was using some other skin lotion that was good, but not as natural by far, plus it was almost 4 times as expensive! I was skeptical that this would do the job, but when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised! Plus, living organically as we possibly can, this product, compared to all the other stuff that I researched, really fits our life style with its almost organic make up. Ordering it was a breeze with no back-order monkey business, as we ordered a good stock of it right away. Good stuff, good company... I am pleased to do business with them anytime!"
3,ok,"This CD was ok, but it should tell you that Tom Hopkins speaks for 40 mins, Zig Ziglar for like 20 tracks, and Mr. White for like 20 tracks. I wasn't too enthused about this one because the authors repeat themselves from their other series. Don't get the multipack - get single packs from each author so you don't get repeats."
3,"Content is fair, format leaves something to be desired","It's not a bad four disk set, I sometimes still throw in the Hopkins disc to work on different closes, but the set leaves a little to be desired. Instead of breaking the discs down into different tracks, each disc is just one track. This makes it extremely difficult when you're enrolled in ""automobile university"" and want to review just certain portions of the material."
4,Ready for a motivational boost?,"Do you want a few quick tips to be a successful sales person? Do you want to get inspired and motivated to pursue your self-development goals? You should listen to this audio deck. Though the compilation is called ""Sales Success"", it is useful for anyone who aspires to be successful. You don't have to be a sales person.The CDs cover all topics including selling techniques, leadership, communication, networking, negotiation, and memorizing people's names. You would also get to know the different styles of persuasion. I like the ones from Zig Ziglar & Patricia Fripp. Imagine going to a convention where all these great speakers are present in the stage talking just to YOU. That is the experience you would get from listening to this collection.These CDs are good ones to listen to while driving your car or when going for a morning walk/jogging."
4,Very Useful,"I'm using this set of CD's to motivate my sales staff. Although some of the material is outdated, it DOES get my people motivated. There's lots about self image, and believing in yourself. This is great because many people have a low self image."
3,Great Audio CDs however bonus DVD did not work,"The audio CDs esp. Zig Zaglar and Dr. David Palmer were very useful. However, the bonus DVD did not work. I tried both my standalone DVD players as well as DVD-ROM players on both my computers. So that was quite a disappointment. This happened even after I exchanged it in the store.I just submitted an ""issue"" with Topics Entertainment on their website - haven't heard back from them yet.If you are interested in the DVD, my advice would be to make sure you check it out prior to buying it.Sudip"
4,Motivation from Today's Top Sales Coaches (Audio Series),"Most of the CD are very useful, plus I can listen and learn when I'm driving."
4,An excellent and worthwhile analysis,"The book is an in-depth technical treatment of the subject, but it is very readable for the layman. Beckmann deals with the arguments against nuclear power in a clear and decisive fashion. There is an interesting analysis of the reasons for the controversy as well. The only major problem I have with this book is the fact that it is rather outdated at 20+ years old."
5,A tremendous scientific response to the anti-nuclear view.,"Petr Beckmann stands up and answers the anti-nuclear attacks. He is very scientific in his answers. This book was written in a way that those without nuclear scientific know-how could understand. Most enjoyable was the voice and attitude Petr Beckmann used. He was tired of the stupid reasons used against nuclear power, and he explains why these reason were stupid."
3,Ain't Love Grand,"The first, and title, piece in this collection is by far the best. It's really funny. Mona is a shallow American girl who falls in love with a shallow Arabian boy, and they both have wildly unrealistic expectations for their relationship. Neither has any idea who they married, and when reality crashes into their world, it's a scream.It's hilarious when newlywed Mona, in her bathing suit, walks past her husband and his friends--""the flower of Islam""-- who are loafing on the couch. They just DON'T GET each other.As their marriage begins to unravel before it even starts, the young couple has to deal with disappointed (and angry) parents and a depressing Hollywood experience.If you can find a copy of this book in your library, it's worth a look."
2,A Faulty Memory,I remembered this movie from high school as a mildly amusing adventure story with some pretty girls showing some of their charms. I had a faulty memory.The pretty girls are there. Tawny Kitaen and Zabou and definitely easy on the eyes and they show themselves off quite a bit. So do a lot of other girls but those are nothing to stick in the memory. The problem though is with the story.It is a silly adventure story but it is much worse than I remembered. A girl devotes herself to finding the butterfly her scientist father died trying to find. She is aided by her girl sidekick and by a mercenary guide. They find the butterfly and a lost civilization of Amazons with nefarious plans. Silly but the background is worse.What I did not remember or realize from all those years ago is that this is some sort of fetish film intended to excite those who like seeing women wear leather and be led around on leashes. Blah!It was watchable but not very good.
1,How the mighty have fallen,"I found Just Jaeckin's ""The Story of O"" and ""Emmanuelle"" to be erotic masterpieces, and bought this DVD on the strength of his past work. Frankly, this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Weak acting, plot and script."
4,Kitaen is Purrrfect,"Okay, the storyline isn't the greatest, but it does have it's humor. If your buying this for any reason other than to see a young Kitaen nude you will be disappointed. There's lots of nudity with a spattering of sexual scenes. Her friend, Zadou, has a nice, but plain face, but a great body.The DVD is presented in a plain package; a picture of Tawny on front with the title, Gwendoline, and a picture of her on the back in one of the uniforms from the movie. This looks to be the French version dubbed in English except for the English characters, but I could be wrong. The titles are in French.It's been a while since I've seen the movie on cable, so I don't know what makes this ""Unrated director's cut"" special.If you're interested in Tawny's acting, get Witchboard or Bachelor Party. If you want to see one of the sexiest woman running around naked and pretending to have sex, buy this DVD!"
3,Ok It's Lame But...,"Various versions of the Perils of Pauline and the cartoon Gwendoline float around and as melodrama these are good topics. It's actually very period and campy as Gwen arrives in China and goes thorough several situations with would be white slavers. Her female companion would never be confused with agent U69 (or U89 depending on the story) but she's adequately winsome. The thing unfortunately gets a bit out of hand when they arrive in the Land of Yik Yak, populated with? ok Amazon's. Lots of stylized partial nudity. As softcore porn with a plot it's not terrible. I'll watch it again. Bondage gets a C-, acting varies from B- to D. Nothing too gorey or too offensive, no donkies, in otherwords nothing worse than ""Batchelor Party,"" just not as funny."
3,Not quite Barbarella,"Tawny and her castmates lose their clothes early, how could you pass that up? The movie is in the same vein as Barbarella, Barb Wire, Laura Croft, etc, but not on the same level."
3,"So bad, it's good ?","This is one of the most poorly acted films I have ever seen. The plot is lacking at times, as well, but also has it's moments. Videography and sound quality are mediocre. I gave it 3 stars, though, because you watch it and say ""this is terrible, but ya know, for some reason, I like it!"". It has all kinds of novelties, like carriages drawn by teams of topless women. One thing that will appeal to some males watching it, is Julie ""Tawny"" Kitaen's lead role in it. Tawny was in Bachelor Party, and some Whitesnake videos when she was with David Coverdale. I could have given this one star or four (never five), but gave it three, so people would not totally disregared it when they read other reviews."
3,The story was lame.,"The story line was really lame.The acting was not very good at all.I guess the only reason to watch it is because of Twany Kitaen,."
4,Gwendoline Rocks,"The movie is a diamond in the rough,the story line just takes you away.If you enjoyed Indiana Jones the this movie is for you"
4,Question about movie??,What is added to this that the VHS version did not have?? Directors cuts are hit and miss. Sometimes they are worth buying for the added material and sometimes not. Is this worth buying with the added material??
3,"If you like a full sweater and an empty head, this one's for you.","It is what it is, a skin-flick with Tawny Kitaen."
5,Wow! Luscious and Etherial. Totally Good Mood Music!,"There are no bad songs in this album, which is unusual with a new artist. Each song envelopes and transforms the listener. The music is peaceful and melodic, wonderful for meditation, or simply as background music. It's truely amazing. I really enjoyed this album!"
2,bugs me,This book is a very brief overview giving only minimal treatment to insects of real use. There are references to name brand products with no description as to what is in it. There are snippets from old books that are included to spice up the text--these are more interesting than the text. There are references to diagrams that must have been left on the cutting room floor.
5,She's on the job again!,"Amelia Bedelia is helping out again. This time she's babysitting. But don't worry -- she's got a LIST! And you all know that if there's one thing Amelia Bedelia knows how to do, it's follow instructions -- to the tiniest detail, even if she's not quite right about what those details might mean.Young readers will absolutely love the cute story and awesome illustrations that bring it all to life! Amelia Bedelia and the Baby is a book that families will adore."
4,KOTEWAU's review,"I thimk that this book is almost the perfect childrensbook. It has humor, education, and is fun for anyone toread."
1,Poor Baby,"Amelia Bedelia doesn't know the first thing about child care. In fact, she functions as a child herself! Naturally, the bumbling maid takes every written instruction literally and of course, you can count on her to bake something. When the child's parents return and see what a mess Amelia made of their place, naturally the wife goes ballistic. The husband shuts her up by shoving a wedge of strawberry tart down her throat. Once pacified with food, they relent and Amelia, drawn by a different artist and wearing a weird looking hat is back in their good books. Why? And did you ever notice that it is always the women who are silenced with food? You can be sure Amelia kept on baking as that was guaranteed to keep her employed."
4,Toddler loves this one,"We love Amelia Bedelia in our house. I read it as a child, and love now sharing it with my daughter. Some of the books are better than others. This is one of the best. My daughter has read it so many times that pages are now falling out. We get to giggle together."
4,Good reference,This book offeres a good reference to all people wanting to program database packages using access 2000.
3,M-16 - 'Canciones Escritas En El Exilio' (Mother West),"Nice blistering ten track disc from this trio who hails from the Dominican Republic. Better than many of the other new(er) metal releases out at the current time. Even though the CD is mostly in Spanish, I've been able to translate the titles of the songs that I thought stood out. Like the ass-kicking ""Why Not Die?"", ""Race"", ""Hit The People"" and their Doors cover ""Strange Days"". M-16 blend that old school earth shattering bass, in-your-face riffs and powerful drums to create a full metal assault. Should appeal to fans of Slayer, Biohazard, Kreator, Morbid Angel and Sepultura."
4,Classic music,"I enjoyed this CD very much. It contained all of the ""classic"" Christmas hits. Nothing beats sitting around with your family at Christmas singing like Chipmunks!"
5,This music CD is terrific,This CD has some well know hits for Christmas. I personally like the chipmunk song. Others include Rocking around the Christmas Tree and more. Good festive Christmas music
3,List of mistranslations,"*""Hidden Forbidden Holy Ground"" is written as: ""Hidden Forbidden Sacred"".*Twin Blades are referred to as ""Twin Users"".*Haruka calls her ""Haruka"" her ""first character"" on page 53, when she is in fact referring to her ""main personality"".*the 4 Long Arms that Tsukasa met in SIGN are referred to as Heavy Axeman.*Lios is written as ""Ryos"".*Ouka is rendered ""Orca"" on page 150-152.There are a few other inconsistencies present throughout the book."
3,.Hack//AI Buster 2,"The .Hack franchise absorbs the novel format, as well as Manga, anime and video games. The books are very short, but concise and interesting. The stories can be found elsewhere on Amazon, so I'll skip to the review:The writing is fairly standard for young adult audiences, clear and fast-moving and not too complex. Those who play MMORPGs a lot might get fractionally frustrated with the constant explanation of gaming terms and phrases, but they don't get in the way or slow the story down too much - the flipside is it means those who have never played MMORPGs can enjoy the .Hack franchise thoroughly without getting lost.I'd recommend the books to any fan of the anime series, or as a great starting point for young adults hoping to the wonderful .Hack universe and its absorbing, philosophical realms."
4,Wonderful Condition,"This book came to me in beautiful condition, just like they said it would! I recommend this company to anyone!"
5,Mission - the Best Book I've Ever Read,"I first read Mission not long after its release in Australia (too many years ago to mention) and I have always had a copy of it in my collection. It's become my bible. Whenever I need reassurance that our world will survive,I drag it out. Works every time! I recently purchased a copy for my dear sister who read it over one weekend. It's the only non-put-downable book I've ever owned.Why in the name of The Man has no-one made a movie of it?Dodie, Australia."
4,A tour-de-force of imagination and story-telling.,"Jesus Christ as a character/protagonist in a novel??? Not every author would attempt such an audacious feat! If botched, the result is messy and embarrassing, yet Patrick Tilley carries this off with the brilliance and panache we have come to expect of this story-tell'in Grand Maestro. This is one tale which deals with a truly cosmic contest of good and evil, and how a jewish New York lawyer is caught right in the middle. A gripping tale of adventures across vast, eldritch spans of time and space, delivered with a peerless management of dramatic tension and the masterful grasp of DETAILS Patrick has come to be famous for. Will drive you to re-read the Bible!!"
4,Good Movie,"It is a good movie, not a classic, but good. Actually a murder mystery. Rahul Roy gets murdered (of Aashiqui fame) and Govinda tries to get the murder. Manisha is his love interest, my favorite Rarah Naazz (sister of Tabu with whom Govinda made some hit films in the past) is his bhabhi and there are a host of villains as suspects. This is probably the only film so far in which you will be able to see Govinda and Shah Rukh Khan in the same movie, although not together in a ascene. Watch out for Sanjay Dutt as well and Jhonny lever in a triple role."
4,A Heart that knew no bounds,"It was fairly easy to read through and lot of informations on that Saint Marcellin Champagnat.We, American Catholics, do not know much about this saint unless you work or graduate from the Marist Brothers' schools or from their institutions.Thanks."
5,Good looking book + lots of info.,"Rosemary Gladstar's Family Herbal: A Guide to Living Life with Energy, Health, and Vitality, is basically all her small manuals (Home Medicine Chest, Herbs for Beauty, Herbs for Children.. etc..) condensed into one handy volume with added information she doesn't include in her other books. She has been an herbalist for quite some time, and really knows her stuff. She also presents it in an easy to read and understand format while including some information about scientific properties of certain plants. Of course, you can't only have one book on herbalism, you have to cross reference, but this is a good book to add to your collection. It has a lot of good recipes, too."
5,YES!,"I am a huge fan, and in all fairness I have to admit that it took me a few listens to really dig this. But now I'm convinced that it is the best album to come out this year. If you're new to Clutch and you even moderately like this album, definitely check out The Elephant Riders, Clutch, and Slow Hole to China (if you can get your hands on a copy).I worship at the altar that is CLUTCH!"
5,Hard Rockin' all the way through,"This album had me groovin from the second I put it in until the end. Just as good as Elephant Riders and PRF in my opinion. I don't know what there is to complain about. For me it was instantly accessible. This album is full of great riffs and awesome drumming, topped off my Fallon's raspy vocals; great stoner rock. The production on this disc is awesome. I think 'Spleen Merchant' is my fave track so far."
4,Real Rock,"This is a great album. I'd rate it four and a half stars if possible. The only reason it is not five is, I just wouldn't say it is their absolute best album (that'd probably be the s/t one). Hell it's still one of the best rock albums of the year though. Not quite as heavy as some of their other albums, but just sounds like what rock should in the 21st century. I love the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) blues influence, especially in Neil's lyrics. The intro comes out and busts you in the mouth, while the acoustic part of the Regulator goes for a much more subtle sound. On WYSIWYG these guys show you that they really know how to play their instruments. The keyboards add a nice touch to some of the tracks also. If you enjoy hard rocking music that lacks all the cliches of todays ""nu-metal"", I highly recommend picking this up (or any of their albums)."
5,Go Clutch this one,"First of all, Clutch is one of the most unique sounding bands in the world. Dramatically different from all the screamers, disgruntled punks and noise makers, most of what they have put out since their first effort in the early 90's is musically superior then most.""Blast Tyrant"" is by far the best Clutch material yet!!!! If you like music, really like music, then go out and get this CD. Great guitar work, booming bass, killer drum beats and most importantly well written. This is what good music should sound like. Thank you lord for this band. Trust me on this one, you will not be disappointed."
5,Can't Stop Listening to it.,Not much to say. Just damn good music. I have a 40 minute drive to and from work. It's been in my car stereo since I received it.
5,This one got me!,Love this CD. Very rocking songs and the style or vein its in is my thing. Lyrically a little loose but the playing and sound of it make up for any thing I don't like. I keep playing the heck out of this thing! Great offering Clutch!
5,Two Thumbs WAY up!,"Without any hesitation, I'm calling this the Best Rock Album Of 2004. Forget these ""return to rock"" bands like Jet, THIS is the real deal. They make Audioslave look pretty modest in comparison. There's no need to review this song by song, since all 15 tracks consist of pure CRUSHING power. Clutch have a talent for creating solid albums and playing great live performances (No backing tracks or lip-syncing necessary!), which is something you can't say about many artists these days. I applaud them for that. (Also, check out ""The Mob Goes Wild"" video, featuring cast members of Viva La Bam.)"
5,Oh Yeayahaaaaa!,"This CD is a music CD, with tracks and riffs and lyrics and such. It's super gooderly too and might be the supergooderliest CD of all time, except maybe some of the other supergooderly Clutch albums."
3,So so so....,"I love Clutch and the influence they have had in my life! Pure Rock Fury was exactly that, they rule as a live band, but this is very ordinary and studied. It's all a bit predictable and only the first two tracks are worth listening to. Definitely see them live."
3,Not sure yet!,I don't know what one of the reviews above was thinking. I like the earlier Clutch cd's the best. The first and second ones are my favorites. If this Cd is anything like Elephant Riders I'd rather save my money. I like the raw hard core sounding Clutch that makes you want to go ape _hit instead of the what they are becoming. But Dig a Slow Hole to China was alright.
2,Given up the Ghost?,"I thought Clutch was above anti-Christian lyrics. I am a long time fan who has now ""given up the Clutch"".I've seen them in concert 6 -7 times and have been a fan since the beginning, these lyrics though have turned me off."
2,BORING,"I still love the man and his movies but holy crap that was the most boring autobiography I have ever read. I was expecting to read about his Hammer days and how he got involved with the studio and how he became an actor in the first place. He barely talks about any of that and most of the book is filled with his stories about his time in the military and, the most boring part of all, his various golf exploits. Seriously. Golf."
4,You can't go wrong with Chris Lee,"Bought this as a gift for someone but actually read it before giving it to them. A funny, well-written book; Lee is a natural storyteller and this book will please both longtime and newfound fans."
1,Awful Trite Material,This is one of the more poorly written books I've read...period. To try and understand ATM from it is impossible. Most of the book is taken up with pointless metaphors and insulting attempts at jokes. I found myself skimming more material than if I had actually just read a protocol spec.
4,Easy to read information about ATM,"I really like this book as an introduction to ATM. It is well laid out and very easy to understand. This book really doesn't 'get into the weeds' with ATM. But for a novice, it is a great place to start."
4,Excellent for those new to ATM,"The ATM for Dummies book has provided me with an excellent foundation of ATM. I'm not a ""techie"", though I need to understand the ATM network in my current position. The authors have presented ATM simply and precisely...with straight forward definitions of acronyms and useful analogies to help the reader grasp the, sometimes confusing, ATM protocol. Where needed, the authors provide more detailed information in later chapters...perfect for when the reader is ready to move on. This book is an excellent resource for those new to ATM as well as those looking for a reference guide to keep at hand."
3,Misrepresentation of Number of Capsules Consumer is Buying,"When I purchased this product, the title led me to believe that the product was in two boxes, 120 ea (as in each). Therefore, I believed that I was buying two boxes of Cosamin DS, each box having a 120 count. However, when I rec'd the item, each bottle had 60 count totaling 120. So, it is misleading to the consumer I think.I have no problem with the product, I just feel I was duped into thinking I was getting more than I rec'd. I think the title should be changed to read: two bottles/60 caplets each. That would be true advertising."
4,Cosamin DS works for me,"I have arthritis in both knees and Cosamin DS was recommended to me by a friend of mine who has used it for many years. I've been using it now for five months and have seen some easing of pain during normal activity and when I play sports. I've also been strengthening my legs by using an exercise bike and stretching, so I can't say that Cosamin DS has been the only reason for my improvement, but I have been happy with the product."
1,MISLEADING!!! 120 each == only 60 per bottle,"Almost ordered it, thanks to Linda's review.Please fix the quantity and make it clear that ""120 each"" while showing 2 bottles does not mean 240 pills. Thank you."
3,high shipping,The product in this shipment were fine. The shipping cost was exorbitant. I was charged $26.95 and found later I could have paid only $4.99 at another company. Never again.
3,Standard remixes for a beautiful song,"Well, the release of this maxi-single is a weird decision on Sony's part. Firstly, By Your Side wasnt so well-received at radio, and perhaps, this maxi may help it up a little. The good news is the album has been steady in the top 15 for as long as it was released, not bad for a group whose last studio effort was a distant 9 years ago. Secondly, the maxi isnt different from the international ones. With the exception of the Reggae Mix, the Yard Mix 1 and Neptunes Mix sound almost identical to the origianl beauty on the album. For fans who were hoping that the US edition may contain the much-anticiapted Ben Watt Mix of By Your Side, be disappointed cos the best remix isnt gonna be available commercially, at least for now. If Sony ever decides to release another commercial single off the album, which I doubt so, it may find its way there. Otherwise, live with some of these mediocre mixes."
3,by your side,"not that great of a cd. I gave it a three star but I think its realy a two star. All of my other cds by sade , i'd watch over and over again. But not this one."
3,Ok,Quantum Cleansing Shampoo Daily 1 Liter / 33.8 OzIt came on time and in good shape. Is just ok as there are better products out there.
5,Unbeatable seventies!,"This collection stands out among every single 70's song ever broadcast. Some of the ultimate landmark songs include: ""I Think I Love You"", ""The Rapper"", and the song that will blast you out of you chair, ""War"". Almost unbeatable and only surpassed by Billboard 1960. However, quite limited in number of songs, which are only 10 tracks. This particularly CD is pretty much duplicated in Ultimate Seventies Collection-1970. If you own that CD, this is not worth buying, unless you are looking for repeats of these great songs. My recommendation list includes: The ""Ultimate Seventies"" Collection, Billboard 60's, and Billboard 50's."
4,strong lyrics with nice backing,"The cover of the Willie Wonka song, ""Pure Imagination"" is greatly done. The painful ""Fall Back"" will hit home with anybody who's had a break up with someone they wish they had not. Bruce has excellent vocals and has obviously experienced the pain of love lost. His new band TOO Much TV should be checked out if you like this one."
2,"Shirley is great, but the songs don't do her justice","If you like Garbage, you might like this album, but personally felt it left a lot to be desired. Shirley sounds great, but the songs all sound very similar. Unless you have a yearning for grunge-rock knock-offs, I suggest you invest your money in something else."
2,Eh...,"I'll admit that I was happy to discover this cd on Amazon and eager to give it a listen since I'm a Garbage/Shirley Manson fan. I also was prepared *not* to compare the overall sound of the group to Garbage, and accept it for what it was. That being said, I was surprised at how painfully mediocre this band was. It's only saving grace was Ms. Manson. There is just nothing memorable about the music while the lyrics have zero substance. Most songs sound like they are fumbling towards the end, as if the song itself just wants to be over. My two star rating is given only because it is interesting to hear Shirley's voice at this stage in her career, since this is truly a ""one listen only"" cd."
2,Flashes of greatness,"But little else. This is not a preview of the vocal craft that Shirley Manson would develop as a result of Garbageman Vig's and (the boys') excellent arrangments and production. But Angelfish does feature a few flashes of brilliance that prove Manson's power is hers and was there all along, just waiting for the right musicians.Angelfish isn't them, however.This cd is surprisingly mediocre. Shirley's vocals are shackled by heavy handed arrangements and cliche'd time signatures. Buy it if you *have* to own every recording of Shirley Manson, otherwise borrow it from a friend."
4,No mistaking Shirley's voice,"Straight forward, I recommend this for all fans of Garbage and Shirley Manson.Let's face it. Garbage is unique because of Shirley's unique voice. Angelfish likewise is Shirley. If you like Shirley in Garbage, you'll like Shirley in Angelfish. Just like Shirley was great in Fox's Sarah Connor Chronicles.This really deserves only 3-stars because of the roughness of the band - being their first release - but Shirley's sultry voice and come-hither looks get an extra star. I love Shirley. This will add a unique element to your Garbage collection."
3,It's A'ight,"Much better than I expected. Everything they do here, someone does better, but it was good to hear Manson with a straightforward rock sound. I think after Garbage's first album, you didn't get much of that. The album could serve as a bridge between 80's & 90's music, or at least a drainpipe. There weren't any particual songs which jumped out at me, which in a way kept the album more cohesive than normal. Usually an album has a few standout tracks and it takes on a lopsided Gestalt. I've already played it a few times, so thats always a good start. If they had another album I'd probably buy it too or at least put it in the queue (I have no idea how to spell that word!)."
3,Only needed for Shirley/Garbage fans,"Angelfish's one album is certainly a servicable early 90's goth-pop-rock album, mainly because of the stunning vocals of soon to be Garbage frontwoman and rock-n-roll icon Shirley Manson. The traces of Angelfish's new wave roots are clearly heard throughout, and certainly The Pretenders and Patti Smith are obvious influences on particular tracks. In the end, it's easy to see that the band was reshuffled from it's previous incarnation (Goodbye Mr. MacKenzie) not only in an attempt to showcase the talent of Manson, but capitalize on a new trend in music. The songs lack a soul and spirit. But they at least provide a vocal blueprint for the type of memorable music that Shirley would go on to make with her fellow members of Garbage."
5,This CD is so cool,"WEll I listened to this CD, and I liked it alot. I like hearing overs, and overs, when I first listened to it. I already liked it the second song on this CD ""Suffocate Me"". I just fell in love with it, it felt very dark and something else which I can't explain. But I say if you are a Garbage fan, and also a Shirley Manson fan get this CD it is worth it."
1,The European Reformations,"I had to read the book for a class I was in, I thought the book was quite boring because it was mainly a textbook which I had to write a summary on. Also the thing i did not care for in the book was how he would start talking about one thing then switch gears and said he will talk about something later which was very frustating to me as a reader of his works personally."
2,Two Different Fits/One Brand,"I bought a total of 4 American Apparel Tank Tops; 2 were labeled from their ""Classic Girl"" line and 2 labeled ""American Apparel"" line. By far the American Apparel labeled tanks fit much better (solid black, dk grey) and were approximately 1 1/2"" longer in length then the Classic Girl tanks (navy, black w/ red star); although I do recommend the customer still order one size up. The problem with the Classic Girl fit is that a size Large tank fit like a size Small with a shorter length. I kept the two CG tanks since these were bought specifically for the gym, the price is excellent, and snug is ok there, but I would never wear them as streetwear. I like the American Apparel tanks for the gym especially because the front neckline isn't too low and the wide color range offered.Be aware that it's a crap-shoot for the customer, you won't know what 'fit' you are getting until the garment arrives in the mail."
4,Very nice.,"As advertised. Well made, and the shirt I ordered didn't shrink after machine washing and drying. I would, however, take a previous reviewer's advice of ordering a size larger than you might usually buy."
4,Interpreting Rumors and Legends,"Many of the books on urban legends and rumors avoid discussion of stories told specifically within African-American communities. This book compensates for this lack of attention, and it provides interesting insights into the legends, rumors, and beliefs that Turner documents. She has arranged this book as a social history that stretches back to slavery times and extends into contemporary history. There are continuities and variations in the stories, but the overall themes remain the same. Mainly, the stories provide ways to understand how the history of racial tension in America is expressed through folklore and fantasy. In this respect, the book provides interesting ways to read the legends for psychological insight as Turner provides an interesting discussion of ways in which ideological constructs become expressed in fantasy."
3,"Informative, but...","This book is kinda cool. It delivers a lot of information and shocking stories that are both interesting and unbelievebale. The only thing that bugs me is the fact that the information is delivered like a book report or news broadcast. The author doesn't really go in depth or use her opinion that much and it's a little bit dry. If you like your myths straight forward, buy this book, but if you prefer a little more color, perhaps you should look elsewhere."
2,Looking for more...,There are only a couple of good songs out of 10... Should have paid more attention to the description. I would be happy if there were even more volumes of this available.
1,It was a lame year,"I bought this CD for nostalgia reasons but half the stuff on here I don't even remember hearing and what I did hear I didn't like on the first go round. Exceptions are ""Come and Get Your Love"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama"". ""Bonnie and the Jets"" is okay but not something I want to listen too over and over. 1974 was a great time for drugs...hence the success of the rest of these ""hits""."
4,This book is GREAT!,"I loved this book! It's so handy with different kinds of breeds. It also shows you how to make cookies in the shape of horses. Actually, the truth is I've never even heard of this book. But it said I could get a 50 dollar gift certificate, so I really wanted that 50 dollars. Sorry for any trouble I may have caused you."
1,Overrated Wok,"I bought this product back in 2004 and definitely would not recommend this product. I found the wok to be very heavy and it took a long time for the wok to get hot.In addition, the product description states that ""Advanced release polymer penetrates pores of metal so that food sears and releases easily."" However, my experience was that food stuck to the wok even when I used quite a bit of oil.So, after using the wok for about half a year and getting tired of food sticking on the wok, I donated the wok."
4,Calaphon wok,I have calaphon pots and so this was an easy choice to buy...Not dissapointed with performance and easy to clean.
2,If you want a non-stick wok.... Not this one,"Calphalon is very tricky! Just try fry an egg on it and you will see what I mean. Calphalon deceptively do not mention this sticky feature in their description. If you take a Typhoon carbon steel wok to compare with this one, the only thing the $160 wok can do better is to stick more on the bottom. If you call them, their CS will send you a DVD to tell you how to use their wok (pure PR BS not helping at all, wok still sticks). They will tell you that they cannot do anything for you.However, they also have a non-stick version of this wok. If you still like to spend heftily on the cookware, non-stick should be more proper. MAKE SURE they spell out non-stick.Bottom line: don't buy this series for non-stick feature. It just can't make it. I really think they ought to recall it."
1,"Not cheese, salt","We ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles, but Amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping. Unfortunately, even at 85 cents a bottle, we overpaid. There is NO cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess. Now we have 10 bottles of a below average product. Save your money."
4,Best Popcorn butter salt,"Not a writer but this Reese Cheesy Popcorn is the best in the area Michigan where I use to buy it at Kroger's. We start buying it through amazon because Kroger's stop stocking Reese Cheesy Popcorn, so I hit the net in search of it. It is very tasty on popcorn better than any other power popcorn salt that's been tried by our family. I highly recommend Reese Cheesy Popcorn to all."
1,All salt - no cheese,Absolutely NO cheese flavor at all. All you can taste is salt salt salt. Save your money and try something else.
1,No Cheese Flavor,I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised. There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product. Even the salt flavor is off. Avoid this product.
1,Not like it used to be,Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning. It is more salt than cheese. In fact it has very little cheese flavor left. I will not be purchasing this product again.
4,A Good Price,"I love this popcorn seasoning and it was cheaper to order through Amazon than to buy thru the local grocery store that charges $2.58 a bottle and is usually out of the product for weeks at time. My only disapointment was that one of the bottles was broken when it arrived. Usually items ordered from Amazon are well padded to prevent breakage but this time there were none of the little airbags that give that extra padding. Still, I would order the product again."
4,Good all around Keyboard,"This is just a good keyboard. It is compacted though; minus the number pad it is about the size of a 15.4 inch laptop's keyboard. When you first turn the back light on it makes a very high pitch noise (Like a TV when it is on) This goes away after a min or so (My guess is it's warming up). I have had mine for over a about a year now, the light still works (I have left it on for a few days every now and then) Key still work. Yeah I would say it is a great buy for the price."
1,good in theory but,"the light only lasted a month, its useless to me without the light. Was the only reason I purchased it. Keyboard itself is compact and annoying but tolerated it becaused of the light."
1,not a good buy,"At first, seemed like a good deal, being ten dollars cheaper than the other backlit keyboards on the market. For a week, it was. After one week of usage, the backlit display stopped working, the keyboard still worked but not the lights. And the lights were the whole reason for purchasing. Keep looking further, do not waste your money on this one."
1,Not Really Good,"Yeah, I'm just not feeling this book ya know? My uncle Simon is WWWWWWWAAAAAYYYY into the Civil War and wants everyone around him to be, too, so he gave me this book. I'm a sophomore in college and American History is my major so I try to read everything I can on the Civil War. I have all of Shelby Foote's stuff, so I was expecting this maybe to be at least entertaining. I found, though, it wasn't. It was a really dry read and I was bored to tears. I finished it all the way so I could discuss it with Uncle Simon, but it was painful. Kind of clunking writing, the story was very dervative and hackneyed, and the writer took more than a little leeway with the facts of the period.I can't recommend. Buy Shelby Foote's ""The Civil War: A Narrative"" instead."
4,Some Great Storytelling!,"I would recommend this book for people who think history is dry. I gave this book to my son who's a junior in high school, and he read it in 3 days. He asked ""why aren't our history books written like that? Why do they have to be so boring?""I can think of no better recommendation than that. Not only did I enjoy this book. My son enjoyed this book!"
4,A Great Classic Album,"I bought the record back in 1979 and it is still one of my all time favourites.There are alot of great Master's songs on this album but tha two I like the most are ""Future of Our Nation"" and ""Love Is'. If you play the two songs back to back you will find a powerful message in the songs. One asks the question while the other gives the answer."
2,Uninspiring and Unmemorable,"There isn't a single memorable melody or even phrase in these two symphonies. This disc is 60:48 of noodling around dissonance with no apparent purpose or effect. Symphony No. 10, ""American Muse,"" was written in 1976 for the bicentennial. I hear nothing of the supposed subject matter in the music."
4,A Story of Dissapointment and Challenge,"Probably best for 5-9yrs. It's a somewhat somber story, but with a character (Uncle James) that's as real as they get.This story is told through the eyes of Jimmy, a young boy who is forced to grow up at a very young age, because his father has died, and has left the family to run their Indiana farm without him. They are hungry, the baby is sick, and they're all tired from trying to keep the farm going.But Jimmy's Uncle James is their savior. He will be coming to help out, and make things great. He has been logging out west, and writes the family of his many, incredible adventures. Only when Uncle James shows up, things aren't so great. He is not the success story he has made himself out to be. He's not perfect. He has problems. But Uncle James, and everybody rises above this, and works to make things better."
3,Light weight and low value,"I received the footprint today and was disappointed in the material which is the same as the tent. It does have multiple ways to tie down the footprint, but for the price, it does not deliver the value. I found other footprints made of heavier material at 20% of the cost. The light weight might be an advantage for backpackers. Also there are no instructions as to how the mulitple tie-downs could be used with the tent. The one other advantage is that it fits the footprint of the tent unlike other generic footprints. If I had the oportunity for a do-over, I would not make this purchase."
3,just ok,"This shirt is just ok, nothing too special about it. I bought it for my dad, but it looks like it's only suitable for wearing at night. I bought it very cheap, so I wasn't expecting much."
2,"OK quality, I just didn't like the fit.","The Soffe Long Sleeve Tee is an OK deal at $6.99 and it qualifies for Free Shipping.I'm a slim to average guy, but the collar (neck hole) was larger than expected for a medium sized tee. The quality of the material is OK and this is fine for working out or lounging around at home. But, if you want a good layering tee for under a T-shirt or polo shirt, I would recommend Russell or J. Crew.You should probably buy one t-shirt first to try out like I did, then see if you like it. The Soffe layering tee is OK, but it just didn't fit as well as other brands."
2,Shrinks when washed,"Bought 3 shirts, grey, red, and white. Red and grey are still great after several washings. The white was no longer wearable after one washing."
3,Watch the sizes!!,"I ordered 2 of these shirts. Both are supposed tobe XL. However the black shirt (the other is blue)is much smaller than XL and is noticable when held up againsteach other.Other than that, very comfortable."
2,not terribley impressed for the over priced soap,"this stuff smelled pretty good, but didn't really make my face feel any better than cheaper scrubs"
1,Not for Rosacea Sufferers,"If you suffer from Rosacea (I suffer from a mild case of this) stay away from this product and scrubs in general as it will only aggravate the condition. Use the glycolic face wash, also from Anthony Logistics. It will keep your face squeaky clean without increasing redness or excessive dryness in the skin."
2,I find this product weak compared to even drug store brands.,"The smell of the Anthony facial scrub is fantastic, but it feels more like soap than scrub. It doesn't last long and is very expensive. I suggest going to a store that carries Anthony and asking for samples before you purchase. Even cheap drug store products like Nivea for Men have far superior facial scrubs."
5,Great Face Scrub,I think this face scrub is worth the money. You only need a little bit to be able to scrub your whole face. It smells good and isn't too fruity or manly. I would reccommend it to others.
2,Nice but does not help the lay person with decorating ideas.,"Some nice pictures and does provide the Zen philosophy, but cannot be used to provide ideas nor gives a ""how-to"" to implement the Zen design into your home environment."
5,Great book for nursing through pregnancy.,"My lactation consultant gave me this book when I told her I was pregnant with my second child. My first child was only four months old at the time and I wanted to nurse her for at least a year. The book is great even if you don't plan on tandem nursing because there is a a lot of info on nursing through pregnancy. I also found the ""Mama"" stories interesting, and they kept the book from being a dry text. I'd recommend this book to anyone planning to nurse tandem or not."
5,Great information!,"This book was just what I was looking for! Answered pretty much every question I had regarding tandem nursing. We're considering another baby and this definitely helped put a lot of concerns I have in perspective. I nursed my daughter while pregnant, but she weaned halfway through. This helped me understand my body, the changes that happen during pregnancy, and how my child(ren) may respond. Also looked at what happens beyond pregnancy. The anecdotes throughout were wonderful."
2,if your nursers will be close in age don't waste your money,"I was discouraged to find that this book constantly referred to the older nursing child as a ""toddler"". Everything, aside from one page was directed at nursing an older child along with your newborn. I got pregnant with my 3rd when my 2nd was just four and a half months old despite the fact that I was nursing on cue and taking birth control! I realize babies so close together is not as common, but it does happen. A lot of the problems I anticipate just weren't addressed. The fact that such a comprehensive book barely touched on it, is making me feel like it might be a bad idea or just too difficult. There is also no info on nursing twins. There is still some useful information, but not enough to be worth buying it unless you will be nursing a toddler with your newborn."
5,Great info,"Reading with a toddler is a bit of a challenge, so I haven't quite finished the book yet (very close!) It is a great resource for anyone nursing while pregnant and/or planning to tandem nurse. I was able to be prepared for some of the changes in the nursing relationship with my current nursling before they occurred. I feel like the book set realistic expectations for what may happen once the new baby is here, and offered suggestions for dealing with issues. Though I am a stubborn mule and will tandem nurse no matter what, the book does talk about weaning and doesn't portray it as a failure. If that is what you need to do for your family, the book offers suggestions and information on how to maintain the closeness of your nursing relationship with your first nursling without actually nursing them. There is a great section on positions, with real photos, which is one of the things I was most curious about. Overall, a great resource. I'm glad I ordered it!"
3,Never watched it,"I gave up on my lab retrieving to hand. He enjoyed hunting far more than any well-trained dog I've hunted over, and as long as he dropped the ducks at my feet so I didn't get wet, that was good enough for me."
3,CD doesn't include the Top 4 hits,"Billboard's book on the Top 40 hits by year shows that the Top 4 hits of 1957 was DON'T FORBID ME, TOO MUCH, YOUNG LOVE (Sonny James), and YOUNG LOVE (Tab Hunter), none of which were included on the CD. They also listed 20 songs making the list that year but the CD only had 10 songs on it."
5,Billboard top rock and roll hits 1957,I got this for my mother who has worn out 2 of these CD's it arrived quickly and the price went up from a couple of years ago when I got the prior one but still a deal for a new CD.
4,Very good disc from the alt-pop era,"I have the main three DIG releases, and this one is arguably my favorite.It has a consistent alt-pop feel to it, with funny and thoughtful lyrics set to nice grooves. I think this one should have been a breakout record for them, and made them a household name. They were starting to get somewhere with the single ""Believe"" off the first big release, and this one should have solidified their status.It's full of potential singles, but most folks probably haven't heard any tune from this album, and that is sad. If you like the song ""Believe"" but not too many others from that same record, pick this one up. It is more polished overall than that first disc.The ""Lifelike"" CD has some good songs on it also, but this one is better in my opinion. A hidden gem for fans looking for more from that time period of rock music."
5,Dead on film for grown folks,"If you know anything about the beach towns east of Jacksonville, Florida, this film will resonate to your toes. The place, the people, and the politics are captured with amazing insight. And besides all that, there is just plain good filmmaking, great writing, and great acting. This is the best movie I have seen in many a year!"
3,Could've been better,"The cast is great including Angela Bassett and Edie Falco, but the movie was so tedious. Each scene roped you in just enough that you felt something was going to happen worth enough to continue paying attention to it. No, it never did. Each scene was bland and by the time I got to the second hour of this, I was thinking, ""Come on, let's go with it already."" I don't mind watching a sleeper where it's a 'talkie' picture, but there has to be something there to keep one interested. The pay off at the end was disappointing and lasted about a minute. Interesting characters trying to save some land was curiously watchable, but by the end of this movie I was wishing all the actors were in a better movie."
3,Too long and too serious,"Ah yes, developer versus Florida. It's all too true, I can attest, as a resident. This film intertwines several story lines to make a whole about the loss of old Florida, along the northern east coast, though the geography in the film is a bit muddled. The characters are at Weekie Watchie one minute, and that is all the way across the state on the west coast north of Tampa. Then they appear to be in a fictional Daytona Beach area, but somewhat north of the real location way over on the northern east coast. The scenery is lush, but the story line is a bit pallid. Nothing is very compelling here. Is this a comedy? Or a tragedy? And why is it 2 hours and 15 minutes long? This is a 90 minute movie, if ever I saw one."
1,Edie Falco Is The Only Reason to Watch This,John Sayles tries to remake Nashville except it's now about the real estate market in Florida. Unfortunately this movie is just dreadful. The only character that is at all interesting is the one played by Edie Falco. The rest of the characters are all minor characters given major screen time and the result is just SNOOORRRRRREEEEE....ZZZZZZZZZ.Please avoid this travesty at all cost or just fast forward to all the scenes with Edie Falco and her family. It's films like this that illustrate why Halle Barry got the Oscar and Angela Bassett never did.
3,"A REVIEW OF HALL AND OATES MUSIC, DUH!","What can be said about one of the greatest music duos of all time that hasn't been said already? Not a whole lot needs to be said when it comes to Hall and Oates. This collection of some of their earlier tracks demonstrates their raw talent is showcased rather well. True, some of these tracks may not be as exciting or excellent as their earth-shattering smash hits, but neither are they dull, wishy-washy, stinky pieces of overblown cheeseball filler.John Oates does manage to hold his own on ""How Does It Feel To Be Back"", ""Camelia"" and ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"", in spite of Daryl Hall's vocal superiority. Still, it's an enjoyable collection to listen to, even thoughit doesn't exactly blow me off of my feet and knock me unconscious."
3,Good but lacking,"McFaul's work is an easily readable overview of Soviet/Russian politcal change since the mid-1980s. McFaul's analysis of the Gorbachev's period is inferior to that of other experts, such as Archie Brown. His analysis of the Yeltsin period is perhaps the best aspect of the book, especially the reason for the failure of the 1st Russian Republic, and the endurance of the second. But at times he loses his 'scholarly distance' and is almost an appologist for Yeltsin. There is little mention of Russian politics sicne 1996, though he does subtitle it ""From Gorgachev to Putin."" Putin's is only mentioned in passing in the conclusion. Brown's latest edited work is far better in terms of contemporary trends including the significance of Putin. THis work is best suited as introduction for advanced undergrads or masters students."
4,Perfect book for Middle School aged kids,"My son needed to do a report on a scientist and I encouraged him to choose Alfred Nobel. This was defnately the best book geared toward a middle school aged kid. Not too many pages, good photos and a great timeline.PS - he got an A-."
1,"There's ""sexuality"" and then there is porn","I did not get beyond the first 50 or so pages of this book and that is very rare for me. I still hesitate to write a bad review, but i am becoming convinced that the author could have done less extreme sex and more plot in the beginning at least. I don't think the child sex, the weird sex and whatever sex was warranted, regardless of the ""point"" that was trying to be made. I love Sci Fi, and there WERE parts of this book that seemed interesting, but - well, call me a prude - I just could not get beyond the distasteful sex acts in this book"
3,"Intruiging, profound hard-sf...but not without flaws","Nearly everything about ""Alpha Centauri"" was powerful and dramatic, with the characters, the science, the politics, the aliens, the technology, etc. But I do agree that the sex tended to take over the plot. I'm not a prude, and I will say that the sex scenes were well-written, but they took away from the credibility of an otherwise excellent story and confused the story's focus--which is a big shame."
2,Not Bad,"This book could have been so much better had the writer taken the time to acualy have a plot. The story in this book is great. I love how he portrayed the future, I like how the characters were differant and had different morals then what we have and how there backgrounds were also different. What I did not like about this book was how it took me almost 300 pages to actually start to like what I was reading. The ending could have been better, I've never read a 400 page book that sums the whole thing up in 1.5 pages"
1,Hope The Mission Doesn't Compromise The Sex,"I hate to sound like a prude but GOOD GRIEF! The authors seem to have missed the lecture on pleasures being best enjoyed in moderation. This book fairly wallows in sex. Can you imagine Neil Armstrong spending his first 5 minutes on the moon lost in thoughts of his first sexual encounter? The first humans to reach another star system and this is what fills their minds? Unbelievable! Beyond this obsession, the book is devilishly hard to read. I didn't make it through the first 50 pages. I sure miss real Sci-Fi writers like Jack Vance. Doesn't anyone write good science fiction anymore?The back cover says, ""Barton and Capobianco are a team to watch out for."" I couldn't agree more."
1,Absolute filth,"Just do yourself a favor, and stay away from this book. I made it through about the first 80 pages, and didn't just trash it, I shreded it because I was afraid someone else may find it. Brutal, graphic details of the rape of a child. Sex sex sex. Characters all have such huge character flaws, they never should have passed their psych tests to be allowed on this flight. Poorly written. If I could, not only would I give this book zero stars, it would have a negative score. Years later, and I am still scared mentally from the filth in this book."
1,what has sci-fi become???,"When I bought this book, I was looking for something interesting to read, since I enjoy sci-fi books with passion. I went to my nearest market and looked for the most interesting title I could find. So I bought Alpha Centauri, and regreted it. Since I started to read this book, I found myself submerged in a very unorganized and many times boring story. The manipulation of sex and its explicit detail grew more and more until it was unbearable. I decided to close this book, never to open it again. If I wanted to read a sex book, I would've picked up a love novel widely sold on supermarkets. I'm very sad bout the intentions of the authors of getting our attention by means of sexual overload, sci-fi is not that, it is pure what may-be science. When I compare this book with the one by Dale Brown, ""Silver Tower"", Alpha Centauri seems as a cheap, vaguely tought novel.In all of my life, this is the only book I have never finished, and I have read some bad literature."
1,"Run, don't walk..","..away from this book.Its been some time since I read (or attempted to read this book). However, I thought that I would do my good deed for the world and warn others away from this book. This book is indescribably bad and is possibly the only sci-fi book that I have ever stopped reading without finishing.If it was possible to assign a negative rating I would."
2,Interminable...,"There is some interesting sci-fi in this novel, but not enough to push the (rather gratuitous) sexual themes into the background. When I read a book about the moon landings I don't expect an extended treatise on the astronauts' sex lives. Ditto for a trip to Alpha Centauri. Unfortunately, that is about all this novel boils down to. Also, it is so cynical and depressing in its view of human nature that the reader just may be tempted to join another species, perhaps even another phylum (I'm not sure the authors' haven't done so already, to judge from their obvious unhappiness with life in general). While I didn't get much sci-fi pleasure out of this reading experience, I did get a practical demonstration of Zeno's paradox: the more I read this thing, the farther I seemed to be from the end (and what blessed relief when it did arrive!)."
2,Disappointing,"Intruiging premise but the end was a letdown (yes, I did finish it, in spite of the fact that I got fed up with the gratuitious sex... found it mostly unnecessary to the story). I felt it usually interrupted and intruded on the story, probably a way for the authors to pad it out. I'm not a prude, but I found most of their behaviours completely unrealistic in keeping with basic human nature. If you like weird sex, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Sexual obsession and high drama.,"I know there is an excellent science fiction tale lying somewhere deep at the core of this novel, but it is really so hard to wade through the piles of sexual dramatics. And it doesn't matter if it is straight, gay, multi-sex or a-sexual -- it just bogs down the storyline to the point of excess. There are good scientific extrapolations, interesting conflicts and some interesting philosophizing, but the tale felt as if it couldn't decide what it really wanted to tell the reader. Stylistically interesting; a story of great promise, but the execution just left me a little cold. Recommended, but be warned it's a challenging read"
2,My least favorite Barton to date. Caveat lector,"____________________________________________Here's yet another caveat lector for Alpha Centauri.I just barely finshed it - my least favorite Barton to date. The uglysexual contortions and unlikeable characters outweigh the finewriting and clever plotting -- and the ""wayback machine"" was abit much, though cloaked in clever bafflegab. See theimpressive set of review excerpts and reader comments that follow-- no sign of hype or puffery here.Good for Ammy -- I might not have bothered with this turkey ifI'd looked here first (doh). Sample: A reader from New Jersey,September 12, 1998: ""This book is the first science fiction novel Ihave thrown away after reading in more than twenty years...""Oh well. Maybe next time. If you missed it, try Barton's ""WhenHeaven Fell"" for a bleak, sexy dystopia done right -- his best todate, IMO. I've read it three times now, and finally posted a review here, which see.Happy reading (something else!)--Pete Tillman"
1,The author succeed in making sex boring,"This book is so boring it's virtually unreadable after the first few scores of pages. As other reviewers have noted, it bogs down in sex (and sexuality, and gender roles), and is hopelessly complex. It's trying to deliver at least a half dozen political messages at once, and is so laden with them that it fails on all of them."
4,I Didn't Hate It,"Not only do the authors explore fun science and species functions, but they also explore human sexuality and various permutations. People have sex. People in sci-fi novels, however, rarely have sex, but the act is certainly part of the human condition.I liked this book enough to have read it twice, and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. So: not everyone hated it. ;-)"
4,"Barton and Cappobianco deliver, though in some erie ways","As always with William Barton's work, both alone and with Cappobianco, Alpha Centuri is bleak but occasionally uplifting. Rather too sexual, even considering the sexual nature of the topic (which is, really, reproduction) the authors give us a future where various members of various powers vie for the future of humanity. The twist, here, is that one of the possible futures, indeed, the likely one, is extinction. Similar in many ways to Barton's recent works, this is space-opera for the postmodern age, with believable science (though one doesn't WANT to believe it) and great characters. A must read, though these two have done better."
1,Distasteful and horrible,"This is not a completely fair review since I didn't get past page 50 (and I got this far only because I was in a carwash and had nothing better to do). However, these 50 pages were enough to convince me that this book is waste of good paper and belongs in the trash can.This is not a SF book, it belongs in the porn section. There is nothing but sex in this book, unjustified and sickening.I don't care what point the authors were trying to make (and I have read the other reviews so I see the point), there is simply no justification for descriptions so horrible. I am sure the authors could have chosen another way of proving their point.Avoid this book at all costs."
1,one star because it wouldn't let me pick ZERO,"Horrible book. I made it to page 30 and threw the book right into the trash can! I might take it back out so I can burn it so no one else has to read it. This is the ONLY book I have ever thought about burning! I got this book because it was labeled as science fiction. it's true label should be ""sicko porn"""
1,A Book Only Useful for ESL Beginners,"When I bought this book, I was expecting that I could refer to many usages of 501 verbs. However, the content of this book was just presenting various verb forms, like ""I, we, you, they forgive"", ""he, she, it forgives"", ""I am forgiving"" and ""we, you, they are forgiving."" If you learn English only for a couple of months, you will know these things. So, I am not going to recommend this one to anyone except beginners."
4,The English student,Nice buying . I read/used this book for study and I'm not disappointed. I recommend.
1,501 English Verbs.,"Very disappointing. Having purchased the French and German verb books in this series, I assumed that this book would be up to the same high standard as the other two. Not so. I am not sure if this book has been written by computer, or by someone who has English as a second language. I think any reader using this book to try to learn English will have a difficult time. Only buy this book if nothing else is available. Then again you might be better off not buying this book at all."
3,Misnomer!,"The title and subtitle of this book are misnomers; there is not alot about being ""happily single"" and alot (very repititiously) about changing your ""internal script"" to become more amenable to partnering. Not a bad hypothesis in itself, of course. If you are single and not happy about it then, by all means, read this book; it contains some valuable information about gaining insight on your situation. If you are, however, seeking support and guidance for finding joy and fulfillment as a single person look elsewhere."
4,"Finally, a book that eliminates the guilt of singlehood","Pretty good book. Helps you get over the feeling that if you're single you're a freak. Gives guidance on how to get comfortable with singlehood, how to resist well-meaning but demeaning comments from parents and others who think the whole world should be married, and how to make decisions involving your status. Some of the case studies border on being a little tedious, but with hindsight, I see the purpose they fill. I'd recommend this book to any single adult."
4,Very Good Intro Book,"If you have interest in getting a flavor of the Talmud in English, this book does it well. The introduction is long but critical to the understanding of the content, and provides deep insights into the interpretation and development of Talmudic scholarship. The material itself is easily accessible in English, and consists of extracts from multiple tractates that are most commonly quoted or are considered important. Approachable for the non-Jew, the work provides an appreciation for the depth of scripture and the very real alternative to Biblical literalism.The Classics of Western Spirituality series, of which this book is a part, is an extraodinarily well done anthology, and is a must for any library if you have an interest in comparative theology."
4,"""The Talmud""",This book does give a lot of understanding of the Jewish custom and life.I would say that if a person really wanted to understand the Jews this book will give you good insight.
3,A Good Book.,This book is about an eskimo girl and here little sister who are forced to survive after their village is destroyed by a tital wave. A white man finds them and offers to help them find another tribe to take them in. The story centers around Anna and her journey to find God with the encouragement and example of Erick to lead her to the right path.
5,The Journey of Eleven Moons,"Excellent book. Counldn't wait for the next book to arrive. I have read almost all of Bonnie Leon's books and just love them. She keeps the reader interested and makes it hard for the reader to go to sleep because ""just one more chapter and I'll turn out the light"" turns out to be I'll just finish the book and THEN sleep. Thanks Bonnie for your great Northern Lights Series. ......."
3,Pretty Good,"This book about the Eskimo girl and her sister is sad, touching and sweet, But I would not recommend it to any one who has not had much reading experience."
3,"Forgettable 12"" Figure","I have come to loathe all things ""Prequel,"" but when the hype surrounding the (then) upcoming Episode I was at its peak, I enthusiastically bought all of Kenner's 12"" figures in the Episode I line, including this Watto figure.Pros - This is a pretty good looking figure (considering how ugly the character is). It's detailed and has a good head sculpt.Cons - It's not very poseable.Despite my feelings about the movie, I have to admit these are some of Kenner's better 12"" Star Wars figures. Watto is hardly an essential character or figure, but if you're collecting the Episode I line it's a necessary purchase."
2,I Didn't Like This CD That Much,"Only reason I bought this CD because it was one cent, and I like female rockers. But I didn't really like this CD because it's just sort of boring, so I ended up selling it to a used CD store."
5,Only scent I wear!,"I love wings. The scent is so , light, mellow and gentle. A hint of flowers is all folks smell. It has staying power too. My clothes still smell good after I wear them. I have sinus problems and most scents makes me stuffy and sneezy, this one does not do that. I wear no other scent since I discovered this one. The fact that it was so inexpensive at Amazon compared to the $80 price tag on the first bottle I got.Try it, I am sure you will love it too."
5,bROthER rocks!,I stumbled upon these guys at the Texas Scottish Festival while I was waiting to see Seven Nations and was immediately obsessed. I bought this album and have listened to it every day since then. They've got a great sound that's so sharp and original...and they've got such cute butts underneath those kilts! :-)
3,Not best purchase for new Brother Listeners,"Let me just say that I think that Brother is a great band. And I like this album.However, if you have to choose which album to first buy, this is not it. ""This Way Up""; ""Exit from Screechville"" much tighter, better albums just because of the production of the recording."
5,"Great CD, Good Composition, Will recommend it to anyone!","I was somehow drawn to this CD by some karmic force. I have never heard of Rachael's Surrender before, but I am somehow persuaded to buy this CD. And let me tell you, this is one great CD. I am very surprised that more people aren't buying this.looking forward to their next album. can't wait. i bet that it would be even better!"
5,when traditional medicine fails...,"A very informative book, explains the problems, their consequences and solutions. Makes you more aware of the environment we live in."
4,Great book,"Took a little longer to arrive than I expected, but it's a great buy. A tad pricey, but glad I made the purchase."
5,A book all women should read,"One does not have to be a high flying executive to read this book. An average working person and particularly women ( because women are more vulnerable to this state of mind either by upbringing or education or by social behaviour ), can really do their homework with this book.Many of us let other people or our invisible inner critic dictate how we should bring up our children, for example, or what to wear or how to deal with Aunt So-and-So or how to clean the house, in all, how to live our lives to somebody else's standards.It is true that this book requires some education. It's above the average morning show self help chat, but it's really worth reading for those serious about placing their own standards and getting to know themselves."
3,Good Album But Does Not Have That Lasting Effect,"I first heard Flee the Seen when an issue of AP came with a sampler disc containing three of their songs. I liked all three songs so i decided to buy the cd. It's definitly a good album. Flee the Seen are full of energy and I especially love the way they trade off vocals. Anderson and Brooks are very good singers though I do wish Brooks sang more often. This album gets me pumped but like I said, it just does not leave a lasting impression. But for 10 bucks and a free shirt it was definitly worth it. Oh and I could have sworn that was Norma Jean during that one breakdown..."
3,doubt becomes the new addiction,"Flee the seen, facedown's FIRST ""emo-ish"" act doesn't disappoint. First of all, i had my doubts upon first hearing them. After a while though, i was hooked. They have AMAZING melodies and Kim has a really nice singing voice. Her screaming, however, NEEDS to go [hence the 3 stars]. Apart from that, it's a solid album, pick it up."
5,very positive! this had an uplifting effect on me!,"Flee The Seen sounds like a mix of happy and excited. this CD may never leave my stereo. in fact, if I had to live with one cd, this would be the one, unless they come out with a new one."
4,Good Mix of Musical Styles,"All of the big pop hits are here in their original versions, but beware an edited version of the Moody Blues' classic, ""Nights in White Satin."""
1,Dry as a bone,"Of all the Billboard compilations I have listened to this has to be my least favorite..well second to least favorite. The only song I really love on this is ""Brandy"". ""Alone Again"" and ""Black White"" are okay. ""My Ding-a-Ling"" is funny but not really a song I would want to hear on a CD featuring music hits. The rest of the stuff I don't like at all. What happened to ""Dancing in the Moonlight?"" Where's James Taylor? The early and mid 70's were really great musically but if this CD is a collection of the top sellers for this year than my only explanation is the fact that everyone was smoking pot."
4,Enjoy the old songs,I love the old songs at Christmas it's a tradition at our house to bake cookies and listen to music.
4,Great Holiday Mood Music,"Great classics, but it's worth the purchase just to hear Eartha Kitt's ""Santa Baby."" Perfect for entertaining or while decorating the house for the holidays."
3,Not as Good,"When I watched the film Virtuosity, I was pleasantly surprised. Pretty good film, although a little phony in spots. The soundtrack during the film sounded incredible and I thought I just had to own it. Well, I guess I didn't need to after all. Yes, there are a few great songs on the CD, and I'm glad I bought it, but it sure wasn't the ""must have"" I thought it was. I wouldn't recommend spending a whole lot on this CD, but if you can spare a few dollars, it is worth it for the few great songs on it."
5,Jar Jar Rocks!,"Great sculpt and articulation. A fine addition to your Star Wars collection. In my opinion, it's the best Jar Jar version out there. Mesa like!"
5,I am woman,This is the best of helen ready it was ok but I like the greatest hits better and it sounded better.
5,Beautiful,I loved this movie. I remember becoming enthralled by it when I was younger. A beautiful Romeo/Juliet type film with fairies and magic. Lovely art shown during the credits make you wish to own everything related to this film.
5,THE SEARCH IS OVER!,I COULDN'T BELIEVE AMAZON OF ALL PLACES HAS THIS CLASSIC MY DAUGHTERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS FILM FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND ON DVD WOW!I ORDERED IT WAITNG FOR IT TO SEE IT AFTER ALL THIS TIME ITS A SURPRISE FOR THEM.I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEIR FACES WHEN ITS FINALLY HERE THANK YOU AMAZON KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GAVE ME GREAT JOY THANKS!
2,I am very disappointed,"I just wanted to say that I expected much more from this movie. I think that the best of Van Damme is when he fights and in this movie he does it a very few times and not as good as he can.Personally I think that the best movie of Van Damme is ""Lionheart""."
3,Fun with time travel,"This is an interesting action/adventure/mystery film with time travel elements. It also has great cinematography. I really like the story. Some parts are a little gruesome, and I have to close my eyes."
3,Awful pan and scan version!,For a film that was shot in full anamorphic Panavision 2.35:1 by a very good director/cinematographer I find it very weird that Universal would only release this in cropped format. Many other people have expressed their disappointment in other reviews about this but I must let you know that the R2 version IS in widescreen. If you must by this film then get the UK Region 2 version. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack remains the same but the movie is shown in it's correct OAR. And that is what matters most.
2,Cropped Pictures YACK!,YES!I agree with the other reviewers!This is the one VanDamm movie I LOVE and when I found it in my one used shop I was so extatic I never looked to see screen format! I never though that it would be Full Screen@!#!*!%!!!!!Ye Gods!it totally ruins that wonderful sceen in the kitchen of him doing the splits!Hey ya I'm a red-blooded female...and I can go OUCH at that scene too! that stunt hurts to do and man.....Whistle.....Looks very nice!The cropping really really ruins the impressive impact of that scene and I've not see the picture since it first came outit was really a Disappointment when I saw FULL SCREENCome on UNIVERSAL!!!WE WANT WIDE SCREEN!FULL PICTURE!!!!this is a fantastic action picture and a crying shame to see it in full screen only!!!!!!
4,A lot of fun!,"Alright, first things first: this movie is by no means great cinema. The plot holes will make you nuts if you think about it too hard and the acting is, well, it's a Van Damme movie, so you know going in that there are no award winning performances. That said, the movie is a whole lot of fun - the action is great, the one liners are cheesy fun and Mia Sara is stunning.The HD has a good picture, definitely a major improvement over the old standard edition DVD. The old DVD was pan and scan, the HD version is 2.35:1 1080p. The sound is much better as well.If you've seen it before and liked it, I recommend picking it up. The price is good as well - I expect with the format war nearly over that more HD DVD prices will drop, allowing those of us who took the plunge to at least score some discs on closeout."
1,DVD won't play,"The DVD wouldn't work, not on any DVD player. And the number to call was one of those that you can't talk to a live person. Soooooo I lost my $10, not a big loss, but I did want to have the movie. Not Amazon's fault; the sender ...."
2,Why No Widescreen DVD?,"I own a Video Casette Timecop and ordered a DVD thinking it would be in the same widescreen format as the original video casette--what a disappointment. There are a number of scenes in the original widescreen format that cannot be duplicated in the full screen format which, as I found out, is the ONLY format offered on DVD. This Video company blew it!"
3,I love this movie.....but,I had the VHS copy of this movie and have watched it countless times. Wide screen plus some extras would have been nice for the DVD release.
4,Better than Expected!,The movie is a somewhat typical Van Damme film transplanted into a realistic sci-fi world. Regardless of the quality of the movie (which was not that bad) the quality of the transfer was exceptional! For a '94 film I was impressed with both the audio and video quality. Bravo!
3,Ok action film,"A time cop races through time to right the meddlings of a corrupt politician in the past. Van Damme is a cop whose wife has died and becomes a time cop. A corrupt politician is messing with the past to get enough money for his political campaign. The movie has pretty good fight scenes which are basically showing off Van Damme and his body. It has an interesting premise for the time it was done (1994) although the special effects were not that good, even for the time. The acting is better than other Van Damme movies though."
4,A fun way to kickbox across the years,"I never get tired of THIS Jean Claude Van Damme flick. He plays an agent for a secret government agency that is charged with maintaining the integrity of the timestream. When he steps into a conspiracy led by a corrupt senator who squinty eyes (Ron Silver plays a great jerk) are on the Whitehouse, things really get exciting.I love time travel in general (as themes for books and movies, not actually traveling through time), so that always adds 1 star to anything I review.There are several problems and cliches with the SF Time Travel theme and a few goofy plot contrivances (why does there have to be a brick wall in front of the sled?) but that is OK. In the plus column is the fact that there isn't the typical 'arena of death' contest or the 'I am blind but I can still kick your butt' scene that Van Damme movies usually seem to include.In my modest opinion, this is Van Damm's best."
5,What a kick,"Van Damme is kickin' again in TIMECOP, the sci-fi kung fu action/adventure where he must stop a greedy politician from altering past events for his benefit, and also intercept his wife's killers. It a nice change to see Van Damme with a longer hair cut. And he even ACTS in this movie too. TIMECOP is a must for any fan of Van Damme, kung fu films, sci-fi films, or movies with actual acting."
4,"Lovely rhymes, stories, a book that grows with baby","I love the rhymes for my lil' baby and I look forward to using this book as a letter, number, color identifier when she's older. I usually avoid Disney books, but I couldn't resist this one!"
2,"Okay this is the second best COTC movie, after #2........","Its about 6 college students bumping into a bad town with a bunch of messed up kids that worship some ""HE WHO WALKS BEYOND THE CLOUDS?"" The people that have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. This movie is not scary, if you want true COTC horror, I suggest CHILDREN OF THE CORN II: THE FINAL SACRIFICE. The scariest one of them all. I have one more thing to say. ""I gave them.......love, I gave them ...........family, and I gave them purpoths!"" HAHAHAHA Watching David Carradine, saw purpose is the best thing about this film."
3,boring...,"This is probobly the 2nd to worst out of the whole 7 movies. It just aint creepy or wierd enough like ""COTC 1"" and ""COTC 4"" They have an adult co-leader and child leader that is about 12 or 13. All the rest of the kids are anywhere between 15-17 years old. This movie didnt show any of thier cult meetings and there was just too much gore in this film, which really was boring cause it was the same kids that killed. If you want to see a decent COTC movie with the kids and the gore, you need to get either ""COTC 2"" or ""COTC 4"" They have more of the little kids in it killing or doing thier cult stuff. But this movie was just not needed for the series."
2,the same old thing!!,the 5th installment in this tired series is not any worseit's just not any better. do your self a favor and buy part 1.they have got so faR from the story it's not worth seeing!!
3,A Surprising sequel...,"COTC V Feilds Of Terror wasn't so bad. I guss, after the fourth one they wanted to include He Who Walks Behind The Rows. You should buy this one, to make your COTC coll- ection complete..."
1,What an awful movie!,This was one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It doesn't do justice to Stephen King's name!
5,the best,i think all the children of the corn movies are good they are suspenseful and exciting all of the children of the corn movies take place in gatlin nebraska where the children worship he who walks behind the rows their god which is said to watch over the corn fields protecting them and eliminate the defilers of the corn under the order of he who walks behind the rows the children carry out his will i think anyone who likes a good scare should see these movies
1,I saw the average score and said OH MY GOD!,"Whatever you do, don't buy this film. Its boring, the plot's stupid and only 5 people die in it. 5!!! Utter trash.P.S. Its so stupid that the heroine can destroy the ""evil hell-fire"" with some petrol and a few old sacks!"
2,Now they are just getting carried away.,"Ok...I'll admit it. I like the first Children of the Corn, I also like the second one but not as much. The third one was ok because they threw in a new twist with the kids being in school and living in a large community. I thought that is where they would stop but oh no, why quite well their ahead... Thank god I didn't see COTC4 available anywhere but online or I probably would have ended up renting or buying it.And then of course COTC5...Why go this far?This movie blew. It did have a good plot with the kids being grown up now but I must say that in no way was this movie scary or entertaining. Don't buy it unless you are a super huge Children of the Corn fan and need to have every one of them. It is a complete waste of time so avoid it at all cost."
1,Not all regions,"I was very dissapointed that this region 1 disc doesn't play on any of my all regions DVD players/recorders. I'd like to know what's different about the region 1 format now. Understand that Amazon does have a disclaimer on their site, but the other two region 1 discs I bought were fine and so it becomes a game of russian roulette if those outside region 1 chose to buy DVD's from Amazon."
1,WHY IS KANE HODDER EVEN IN THIS CRAP!,YOU IDIOTS! Cease the sequels and erase them. Was Kane Hodder only in this for the money or just for a laugh. The original is all that should remain and no sequel garbage at all.
3,wildflowers across texas,I love the book and it was in great shape except for damage to the spine. I wish I had known about that before I purchased it. Fast shipment.
3,not totally happy,"we received the watch in working condition, however, we felt that we got a used one and not a new one. This watch is supposed to do a lot of things, calculate, 3 or 4 alarms, etc. We found that not all of the alarms work and the ones that do, only work once in awhile. It does keep time and the calculator works most of the time. We just didn't want to go to the fuss of sending it back and take a ""chance"" on another one. I've had good luck with Amazon before, but this time wasn't the best."
2,memory defective,'a' button doesn't make a good contact works sometime & not other timesmemory sometimes give a false (full) very disappointed in product
4,Typical good Casio Calculator Watch,I have owned several Casio Calculator watches. The last one was waterproof and yet died when I wore it while I worked up a sweat. I wish this one was waterproof. But I just won't wear it when it could get wet. The buttons are a little stiff but work OK with your fingernail. I cannot live without a calculator watch and this was a reasonable price.
4,great gift!,"My boyfriend can't stop playing with this watch. The buttons are very sensitive, so you almost always select the number you intended. It is great for quick and easy calculations. Great watch!"
3,Fun watch,"This is a fun watch that does what it advertises. It sits flat on the wrist and is pretty compact. My only hesitation is the construction/material of the watch band. It has a consistency of a cheaper feel or older type of resin technology. Definitely doesn't have that sturdy, rubbery feel of most modern resin bands I have.A fun watch but not recommended for an everyday wear unless you replaced the band."
5,My watch found me,"I've had several Databanks over 20-odd years. I find the letters hard to see.I took my watch off on a visit to the beach in Florida where I was visiting my Mom. When I got home from the beach I noticed that I didn't have my watch. A day or two later a man phoned wondering if I had lost my watch. He had found it and while fiddling with the buttons - up popped a phone listing for ""Mom"" in the same Area Code as his (where my Mom lived). All my other numbers were for a different Area Code. He figured out that the watch's owner had likely lost it while at the beach nears the mother's house. So he called the number and I got my watch back."
4,Fact: this watch is AWSOME,"this watch is so cool- every function works- the only problem is that there are supposedly FAKE casios out there and this might be one only cause it has absolutely no water resistant rating on the back pannel-??? I don't want to test it so i just havn't got it wet, i'm sure it will get wet one day and only then will I know how water resistant it is... no biggie though"
3,great watch,Great Watch! Arrived very quickly. Only complaint is that the illuminator button doesnt have a function to it. Its a great watch to add to any collection. It made the 10 year-old in my very happy to finally have a calculator watch
1,Bad Watch!,This was a bad choice. I had a Casio Data Bank 300 for many years and it was a great watch but this is a POS. Don't buy it!
5,This watch is timeless!,"this was the most awesome watch over 20 years ago, this is still an awesome watch to this day! I received so many compliments wearing this watch and it's definitely a conversation starter. You can't beat that with any other watch that costs under $30!!!!!"
3,Casio review,"This is the third Casio Databank Digital watch I have owned. It operates as advertised except the button used to initiate input is very difficult to operate. It takes many ""pushs"" to get it to work. A person who found it difficult to manage small buttons would find it difficult to use this watch."
2,Not a DBC150,This is the only replacemment I could find for my DBC150. It is NOT nearly the watch that the 150 was. Why did Casio discontinue the DBC150. A GREAT step backward !
5,The unique sound of Billy Vaughn,"I remembered Billy Vaughn from when I was a kid. My mom was a big fan. I only recognized a couple of songs on here but decided to take a chance. I did good! Once I listened to the CD, I was familiar with most of the songs and they dusted off a 'bunch' of memories. Highly recommended."
3,Like it,"Music is personal, so I suggest you listen to the samples and decide if this is for you or not, but I like this CD. My best description is that it is unique but not weird. Have a listen and see for yourself..."
4,GREAT!,This is a great ROCK/METAL CD for those who like Rap-rock and powerfull guitar riffs.I love the Black Sabbath cover!
1,only words you can use to describe it are WRONG and BAD,"they look like they should be playing sick of it all covers or pressing license plates but they're not.record companies must really be scraping for a new trend if this is the best they can come up with, seeing as how they're being promoted all over television and their stupid dvd is on display in most every record store. radio needs a new trend bad."
1,Same catagory as Brittney Spears,"Holy ..., this is so horrible. For the first time in a long time I poked my head out from the underground death metal world to see what's brewing in the up-and-coming popular scene, and as a result I am convinced that the majority of people out there who comprise the radio-listening crowd are absolute fricking retarted hamsters. Do you really like this? Are you serious when you use words like ""heavy"" and ""hardcore"" in your reviews? When you refer to passages of the songs with descriptions like ""the next part really rocks hard"", what can you possibly mean by that? And especially those of you who say things like ""the next Linkin Park,"" it makes me laugh until I realize you truly mean that! HOW? You may have noticed this review being identical to several others. That's because it's easy to copy and paste these reviews when the music was created the same way."
5,well done debut,"3RD strike is a good band. the music is is metal and the lead singer can switch his voice to soft and to loud angry rap. it starts out good with flow heat a great song and ends slow with hang on a good song. the best songs are no light, paranoid[black sabbath... also with awesome meaningful songs like lisa and redempition. this cd is a must buy."
5,GREAT CD!!,This band has to be one of the best bands ever.It's just to bad that they no longer exist. Their music is so good. The tune and everythin is great. I would recomend people to buy this cd as its their only one. Im sure when you listen to it you will be a fan.
5,unfortunate loss of such a good band,"I was disappointed to hear that 3rd Strike broke up. I heard about three months ago or so. I've loved this band ever since I first heard them. I saw their video for ""Redemption"" and I absolutely loved the song. The songs are all high quality and easy to sing to. I introduced one of my friends to them and they are now his favorite band. I recommend buying it. After all, it is their ONLY CD. Good for fans of Flaw, Unloco, and possibly Ill Nino."
3,not as bad as some point them out to be,"alright, so they do rap, and they don't pull it off so successfully.the music presented isn't half bad, as it's very groove heavy, almost sevendust like at some points.the singer is definitely a pithole for this album, but the music is good for the most part.for fans of dry cell, cinder, sevendust, and element eighty."
5,really good!!,"tis is what debuts should be all about.. even with dozens of new bands that don't really add anything new they managed to impress me. It's not a whole new kind of music but they have their own sound..I'd rate it 4 stars, but to balance things (i freaked out when I read the 1 star review) I'll give 'em a little extra.keep up 3rd strike :]"
2,Talent but not my type.,"Okay this isn't a 'blending' of Rap and Hardcore (They weren't playing 'Metal' guys, metal is Arch-Enemy, Zao, In Flames, As I Lay Dying, THAT'S metal. Guitar, Double Bass.)...They took RAP...they took HARDCORE...they did it at the same time.This doesn't make Rap-Core. It makes Rap and hardcore at the same time. You fade the music out, it's rap. Fade the lyrics it's hardcore. linkin Park blended these pretty well. 3rd Strike is sort of just trying to do them both.If you guys really like these guys, try out Bionic Jive's Armageddon Through Your Speaker. Lots of the same styles. hardcore and rap un-blended, just played at the same time."
4,Dont listen to anybody,"3rd Strike is a band with potential, talent, and good music. There are two sides here: 1)People who listen to old ""real"" metal who hate anything commercial (Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit)and 2)People who are not idiots (most) but are ignorant and like commercial sellout bands (Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit). I do not fall into either of these groups because I don't care if the music I like is called ""nu-metal"" and isn't ""real"" to group number 1 and I know a sellout commercial crap band when I see one. I do however listen to whatever sounds good no matter if they are commercial or underground. As for Linkin Park, Hybrid Theory was ok, Meteora sucks commercial dick with terrible lyrics. Anyway, all those fans of the old school who think anything labeled ""nu-metal"" sucks, shut up. And btw Lost Angel is a great album."
1,it never stops,"OK, I just turned on ""No Light"" because my brother had downloaded it for whatever reason. As soon as it begins, you hear the standard boring drumlines, the standard nu-metal guitar riffs, the typical barely audible mediocre bass and then the typical everyday vocals. then as if it can't get any worse, he starts rapping, it's so predictable anymore. This band, Trust Company, Staind, Adema, Linkin Park, Drowning Pool.....they all show the decline in today's music. If you want real metal that isn't rap filled or whiny and is truly heavy, go to Killswitch Engage, Pantera, Superjont Ritual, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse, Down, Poison The Well, Soulfly, etc..... and stay away from bands like this and the ones mentioned earlier. Nu-metal sucks. Especially this."
3,"These ""Reviews"" are for a different CD!","These reviews are not of this CD (I own it). They're for a live performance, released on Telarc (this is a Capri CD). This recording does not feature Christian McBride - look at the cover! This is undoubtedly Amazon carelessness, and not the fault of the reviewers - find the other CD on Amazon, and the same reviews will be there. Not at all helpful........See: [...]for other CD"
5,This Rules,"This album is an amazing collection of coolness. If your like it as much as I do, you'll love Christian McBrides cover of ""Deck the Halls"" (appears on the album as ""Double Decker"") It's the best cover of a Christmas Classic that I've heard in years. It's on the album ""Jazz for Joy: A Verve Christmas"", check it out you won't be sorry."
4,"Bushnell Trail Scout Pro 3.0 Megapixel, with Night Vision",Excellent value and don't believe Cuddeback is faster. Save your money.Flash activation is not always right for the light conditions. Get dark photos sometimes that should have had flash activation.Very Happy overall...
4,nice product,"It works for observe animals in the night and of course, taking pictures.one regret about the SD cArd : I thing it doesn't work up than 2 Go"
3,Challenging for self-learners,"I read about the positive reviews here and took the plunge - put my order to have the book delivered across the Pacific Ocean. It was a delight at arrival - well printed, realistic scenarios posing the ones I experienced during my trip to Italy. Excited and carried away, I quickly got myself a tutor to accompany the book (I figured, if I can not be in a classroom like the other reviewes did, a native-speaker tutor should well be a good alternative.) The problem is, once the tutor leaves, I can not recall what the pronounciation and accent of everything, anything, is like. The audio CD that comes with the book does not provide line by line demonstration. It only has a 1 minute long conversation for each of the 17 chapters. But for a beginner who has but 1 hour of private lesson per week, I would appreciate more ""sound"" from the book to keep me familiar with the language. Aside from the drawback, the book has been good otherwise."
5,Molto bene!,"This textbook with accompanying CD is VERY EASY to follow, giving many excellent real-life experiential samplings for converational Italian, along with the all-important grammar, vocabulary, etc. I am enjoying it as an accompaniment to the Converational Italian class I'm currenty taking at university.Ciao, amici! See you in Italia...:)"
4,the shiz,"Like McDonald's says, ""I'm lovin' it""! No doubt, this single holds some sweet tracks that make it great for a short workout to get you up on your feet and bustin' a move!"
5,Nick Lowe classic - must have!,Even my 13 year old daughter (who's much too cool for this stuff) loves this album. It's a great alternative to having her tune into the local radio stations on our drives to soccer practice. Buy it!
1,"Pure sugar fluff, couldn't wait to get to the end.",This is the first book of Barbara Delinsky's I've read that I didn't like. It was so predictable. I can't believe men really talk like that in real life. I couldn't wait to finish it.
5,Doug Donohue is a dreamboat,I hope that I can meet a man like Doug one day. He is my true fantasy. What a great book!
1,Funny in a fifth grade sort of way,"I remember reading Field and Stream years ago while I was waiting in the dentist office. I think I was in the fifth grade.I read a few stories by McManus there, and remember cracking up in the office.I was looking for laugh out loud humor books and remembering the above, I ordered this. I wish I had not, as I ruined a perfect memory.Childish, maybe 5th grade level funny. Maybe."
4,A Fine and Pleasant Misery,"A Fine and Pleasant Misery written by Patrick F. McManus was a good book. He used Humor in it, which made it more interesting. He wrote of the adventures he had when he was younger, along with the adventures that he still enjoys today. The book has its dull times, but over all it is an exciting book. Many times through out the book I was confused only because I didn't know what some of the terminology meant in such subjects as fishing. If you are interested in camping, fishing, hiking, rafting, or anything to do with the outdoors, I would recommend this book!"
5,Funniest book I have ever read!,"There was a point that I had to stop reading (and you'll know where when you read this book!), because I couldn't breathe I was laughing SO hard. The same thing happened to my husband when he read it. It's not just this book, they are all great. I highly recommend this for anyone to read. (I'm chuckling now thinking about the funny stories, and it's been 10 years since I read the book!). I'm now buying another copy for my son, who just last summer spent 10 days in Montana. (My original copy is long gone, having been sent around to many friends.)"
4,A Fine and Pleasant Misery,I was raised when the outdoors was our computer game. We spent the majority of our free time outside creating our own adventures instead of exercising our thumbs in front of a TV screen or computer monitor. Patrick McManus writes of those times with tongue-in-cheek humor and and brings those of us raised in that world back to a different time and place where kids had to use their imagination to create adventure and not have it spoon fed to their fingers. A fun read that is highly recommended.
3,Always good for a smile,"I do enjoy Patrick's humour and was surprised to learn he is from my new state of residence, WA. He translates well into most areas that offer hunting, fishing or just a love of the outdoors."
5,Funniest outdoor book I've ever read!!!,Patrick Mcmanus is an awesome writer! I could hardly put the book down. It was so FUNNY! His way of describing real life outdoor situations is hilarious. He is definitly one of the best outdoor humorists of all time!!!
4,So far so good,First book I have from him. Supplier got it to me quick. Great reading so far. I just might have to get more from Mr. McManus
5,Imagine Mark Twain and Dave Barry on a fishing trip!,"WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU'VE HAD RECENT SURGERY! (Or else you're bound to rip your stitches.)I'm not sure why I ever picked up a Patrick F. McManus book in the first place, as I am not an outdoorsman, but now that I have, I can't put him down. McManus writes broad, slapstick humor of which he is invariably the foil. My favorite gut-buster involves having the preacher over for lunch when his dog, Strange, develops an itch in his hindquarters. I don't remember if it was in this or another of McManus' books, so you'll need to read them all until you find it."
1,Broken upon delivery TWICE,I purchased this item after Christmas- thank goodness I checked the box before packing away with my Christmas stuff. The candle was snapped in half. I contacted Amazon & they shipped a replacement with no problem. However- this 2nd was was broken as well. Poor quality? I normally LOVE Bethlehem Lighting products- very high quality. I'm not sure if this is a packing/shipping problem or a quality issue. I also thought this was the cordless version because the picture didnt indicate a cord. Not a big deal if you read the description :)
4,perfect for winter,"I put these in my windows and I love them. I always come home to a inviting house. I use the ""timer mode"", they come on at 4pm and shut off at midnight! Perfect for a Maine winter!"
3,"Ok product, but a bit shoddy","We purchased a few of these lights and they work pretty well. The timer function is really nice to work with. The blinking lights that are included are a little iffy.My only complaint is that one of them fell off of a window sill, I tried to switch it on, and the switch is now broken? The switch managed to get pushed into the candlestick housing. The candlesticks seem to be really fragile.I am not sure the price really justifies the quality."
4,Very expensive for 1 candle,"I have this candle and they work very well, but the asking price for 1 candle is awful. You can purchase 6 for a lot less. Bethlehem Lights with all the timer and sensor, look wonderful in windows year round and they come in 2 metals,nickel and brass. This candle looks the same as the ones I purchased from another."
2,NICE LOOKING CANDLE,"VERY HIGH QUALITY OF CANDLE LOOK. OUT OF SIX CANDLES THAT I STARTED OUT WITH LAST CHRISTMAS, WITHIN 1 MONTH FOUR OF THEM WENT BAD. WILL NOT WORK WITH A NEW BULB. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AS THEY ARE EXPENSIVE CANDLES THAT DID NOT LAST FOR ME. COULD SEE THAT A NEW BULB AND YOU CAN TURN IT OFF AND ON BUT JUST WILL NOT WORK AT ALL."
5,"Love It, Love It, Love It","What more can I say but I love this item. I have had this about a week or two now and even hubby loves it. I have it in the front window by the door and now hubby can see what he's doing when he gets ready to leave for work in the morning without having to turn on the big light. I have it on sensor and it come on gently with the fading light and glows brightly until dawn. I will most certainly be getting more of these for my other windows on the first floor. It has the sensor that will come on at dusk and off at dawn, a timer which will be on for 8 hours off for 16, and the on and off switch. Great size candle and heavy base keep it from moving around like the cheaper versions. Comes with two different bulbs and 5 foot attached cord. Well worth the $$$ in my honest opinion."
2,Priced way too high!!,I am shocked by the price of this game. I bought this game a couple of years ago at JCPenney for about $25. The price of $80 with $20 shipping and handling seems excessive. If it like let it ride and 3 card poker you'll enjoy this home set.
3,Very limited,The book didn't contain any names I was looking for. It had list of names I never heard of. Most should also come with pronunciation guide. But otherwise their isn't another book quite like it so i went ahead and gave it 3 stars.
3,What's the point again?,"An interesting film...just not much in the way of hard facts.This short film explains that not all hackers are criminals. Who would've thought? Apart from that there's not a whole of information. Stereotypes are just that. Rarely does a stereotype define an entire group of people. Hackers are no different. This film addresses those assumptions...no more, no less."
3,faulty ring support,"The hubcaps,appearance wise, look great. But you need to be very careful with the plastic ring supports. I had a brand new, out of the box set of hupcaps that the plastic support broke on one of the hubcaps as I was placing the ring in place. The plastic just snapped off. Maybe from a weak mold. The box of hubcaps was replaced by Amazon, so I will see what luck I have with the new ones."
2,I've lost 2 hubcaps already,"Pros:-They're cheap-The lookCons:-Made of cheap plastic (about as hard as a Frisbee)-Don't lock in securelyI purchased the correct size but the hubcaps don't lock in tight. I've already lost 2 under normal driving conditions. If they weren't so cheap, I would have went back to get them when they came off. Get these if you're selling your car and don't care if they come off."
1,This is progress?,"There used to be a simple Casio databank watch that let you keep phone numbers,tell the time, set alarms and time a footrace.Casio, however, seems to have ""advanced"" the product so much that I have found it unusable. I have spent more ""time"" from my life trying to set it correctly and use the functions than is worth the low price. Right now, it is two time zones off and beeps when I don' want it to.Part of the problem is a ""manual,"" which like all of them in the electronics area, is too small to read and so thick it won't stay open on your lap or table. How about if instead of sending manuals in multiple languages, the order form asks which language you want."
2,"Alas, what could have been","I've been a fan of the Casio databank for years, particularly the previous iteration, which had a very intuitive interface, so that I could enter a phone number, locker combo, etc. in 30 seconds flat. Only problem was the chrome-colored case was plastic underneath, so it chips away and then nibbles at my shirt cuffs. This one has a metal case with rounded edges and promises a great deal, but the interface is all but unusable. Entering phone numbers is arduous and then they display in a totally unhelpful format. Even the calculator requires multiple keypresses to find the desired operation. As for the band, I've always switched out to a Speidel asap. I'm going back to the old style now, plastic case or not."
5,Casio Men's EDB610D-8 Databank Digital Watch,Got it for a friend's birthday. He claimed that this was the perfect gift since he had been looking for this watch for a long time. This gift made his birthday. Price was great.
4,Casio Databank,"The watch performs as advertised but the interface isn't as ""smooth"" as I would like. However, I have no other complaints. It is light, fits well, and has all the features I was looking for."
1,Is this a phone?,"I was in the market for a new calculator watch after my DBC-1500 started falling apart at the seams. I didn't end up buying this watch for 3 reasons. The first (and most commented on) is the lack of schedule feature. The second is that the date is no longer permanently displayed (a HUGE retrograde step in my opinion) and thirdly and most annoyingly, the numbers are upside-down. They have replicated the number layout of a push-button telephone, rather than a calculator. I ended up purchasing a brand-new, unopened DBC-1500 from a large, well-known auction site. Why change when it was already perfect?"
5,Great product,"This is the third watch I have purchased. Wouldn't be without it. Will buy another one when this one wears out. Only reason I bought a new one is the screen scratches not easily, but when it does, I take it to my jeweler and she buffs it out."
4,Casio databank watch,"This is one more of many Casio watches I've had. It appears to work just fine, however, I was disappointed that I had to take it in to have some links removed from the band."
2,Horrible horrible,"This is terrible, nothing like the old databanks.And are they EVER going to put in a square root button?"
3,Point out some of the problems,"I admit I do not own this watch but I played with it for quite a bit in the store, before deciding on one of casio's other databank models. The central problem with this watch is that it does not provide any schedule-memo as the traditional databank watches do. So although you can store as much data as you like and type it on the go (two other important features), you can't stick in that doctor's apt or school exam date and have the watch convienently remind you with a 2-week calendar at the top like casio's other models. I really wish Casio would come out with a model that has all the same features but includes the schedule-memo and I'd be sold."
1,Schedule memo gone,"I've been using Casio Databank watches since around 1989 and have loved them all along. I forego a stylish watch for the features.I always used the telephone bank to keep track of my phone numbers, and more importantly, I used the schedule memo to keep track of all of my family birthdays. The watch would let me know in advance, and then would beep (annually) when a birthday was up.Now, with my cell phone, I don't need the telephone database any longer. They're all in my phone. It's faster and easier to pull it up on the phone and hit ""send.""But the schedule memo is still why I wear the DBC-310. So I was looking at these new models and saw that they were much more stylish. I could have my ""geek watch"" with a stylish look.Bought one.Found out later that they'd dropped the schedule memo feature.It's useless to me. If I want to tell time and have a stopwatch, I have a multitude of choices. I NEED my schedule memo.Guess I'll buy another DBC-310. Why would Casio drop this feature?"
1,"The label on the keys rub off! Otherwise, nice watch.","Nice watch, easy to read and store info. Keys have a good feel, rubber like.There are two layers of LCD, the bottom one (which most screens use) is easier to read and large. Standard input using the keypad for letters. Phone numbers formatted a little strange.After owning it a year, ALL of the keys are now completely blank.I guess my sleeve rubbed off the printing on the soft rubber keys. I will have to send the watch in for warranty repair I hope..."
1,Disappointed,"I have owned three Casio Data Bank watches prior to the latest one. I found them to be adequate for my needs. That was not the case with this model. It proved to be much more complex, less functional and devoid of a ledgeable owners manual and instructions. The instruction manual is3-1/2""X2-1/4"" with print so small you would need a microscope to read. I immediately called the Casio Customer Service number to request a manual I could read. The service respresentative was very courteous and said she would get a manual in the mail. I am still waiting on it, and still unable to program the watch. My advice would be to stay away from it."
3,too complicated,I have the previous model casio data bank 300 which is easier to use and has more features. This model is much better looking and the larger time numbers are easier to read but I miss some of the features of the old watch such as the ability for me to store and be reminded of the birthdays of all my family and friends as well as a better calculater. On balance I am wearing the new watch because it is easier to read the time and is better looking.
1,Sorry I ever bought it,"I have been wearing Casio Databank watches for nearly 30 years and I have loved every watch I've ever owned -- and I've owned several because I wear them roughly and constantly rip off the band and damage the area where the pins attach the watch unit itself. Recently I did that again and discovered this new style databank and thought I would give it a try.I hate it!! It is not convenient to use with all the little icons. It is difficult to program; and the numbers on the calculator are backwards with no clearly marked +,=,x, or division signs.As I write this I am preparing to use Super Glue to repair my old watch and purchasing a wide leather band with snaps to ease the wear and tear on my beloved old-style databank.This is supposed to be progress? New certainly isn't better."
4,both good looking and smart,The product looks very nice on my wrist but it was not that good for the hairs on my arm until i lose all of them wearing this watch. The alarm sound is not loud enough to wake you up but it's still useful during the day when you're awake. I used to use casio databank dbc-62 since i was 12 and i've bought exactly the same product again once the old one got broken after 8 years but i could only find korean version of it and it wasn't as good as japanese version as I lost the new one in 2 years. I guess This new product i bought really replaced my old favourite casio dbc-62.
1,Worst Data Bank ever,"I bought this because I was impressed by the large number (350) of data pages available. However, the watch's quality is astoundingly poor for a Japanese product. It's made of obviously inferior materials, scratches easily, and the numbers on the pads wear off very quickly from normal use. I've had it for only a few months, and almost half the pads are illegible now. Also, the data pages display phone numbers strangely, unlike all the other Data Banks I've had.I've used Casio watches exclusively for decades and this is the first that has been a major disappointment. I should have paid more attention to the reviews here.Casio needs to learn that it shouldn't abuse the loyalty of old customers like me by cutting corners and putting out shoddy products like this one."
4,"Very nice, but odd limitations","Overall a nice watch. Good screen contrast and everything works as advertised. The interface isn't as intuitive as it might be and the calculator has no ""Clear Entry"" functionality. I'm glad I bought it."
3,so so,"On balance a good collection of Jazz performances featuring high fidelity until you get to John Pizzarelli's ""I like Jersey Best"" which may have been entertaining live but in this SACD, a throw away track at best. Bad choice for music that should feature the high fidelity reproduction of SACD technology."
5,Made my life easy,I couldn't believe I could get these from amazon! Yanked the old strut out (instructions were well done) and put this one in. About 2-3 hrs to complete. Mostly waiting for penetrating spray to work. Saved me big bucks. I really believe anyone can do this. Great product!
2,"It Won't Give You a Black Eye, but.....","Followed the instructions to the letter. Metal surface was clean, smooth & free of any solvents. Wiped it down several times with ethyl alcohol. Applied Black Magic with a Qtip as recommended and got very uneven results over the area (about 2in long & .5in wide). Repeated it 2 more times with the same result - uneven bluing. Yes, It does blueing but I can't recommend it if you want a quality appearance."
5,works great!,"Never used anything like this before, but had an medieval axe head that I wanted togive a darker metal appearance to. All I can say is that it is very easy to use ( just putsome on a cotton ball) and apply to the area. Once you've washed off any residue, let dryand then buff with 0000 fine steel wool. Awesome dark metal finish!"
5,Excellent product,"I have an old 20 guage thats worth more in memories than actual value. I've had it since I was 13 and I am 43 now. Last December I hunted when it was snowing outside and got the gun wet so after the rabbit hunt I wiped it down and put it back in the case where I did not touch it again until this August. Imagine my surprise when I looked at this totally rusted gun! I searched Amazon and found Black Magic, read the reviews and decided I would give a try. The rust came off easily with steel wool and after I put the bluing on it looks as good as new. I put two coats on according to the directions and couldn't be happier with the results. If you screwed up like I did and left your gun in a case instead of taking it out you might want to try this product. Just my two cents."
3,Not the best,"Thought this would cure my problem of holster wear on my Colt Lawman MKIII barrel. I was so wrong. Followed the instructions to a ""T"". It did not come out shiny and blue. It did come out streaky and flat black. Not very happy with these results. Will not try this product on any of my other guns."
1,Disappointing,"This book is nothing but a hardcover magazine. Gorgeous pictures, useless content. These are not the memories of a French grandmother so much as a big... ad for you to buy a whole lot of products, try out some weekend project that never ends, give up and go out and buy more useless products. There are much better books on this topic for people who are serious about the running of their home but are mostly, unfortunately out of print."
3,"Warning -- Same Book, Different Title","I only gave this book three stars because it is the same book as ""Secrets of Good Housekeeping"" also by Laura Fronty -- same content, lovely photo's, etc., only difference is the title."
3,It's worth a look,"I have not read the books written about in the other reviews but I found this book to be a delight. Some people wouldn't understand the intent of it, I do and I enjoyed it a lot. Not all the advice should be taken literally, as with all books, one reads critically and uses common sense. Beautiful photographs."
1,Deceptive???,None of these tracks sounds like the original. Glad I previewed it before I wasted my money.
4,"Great song, done well.","Great acoustics, but the compression from the site was such that I still bought it on CD. Good starting point for those with a taste of classical music, and good for baby too. Very relaxing when at home and while on the go.Everyone should have some of this in their life, it adds bredth and depth to musical taste, and that is lacking today."
5,Music filled with passion! It will carry you away.,"Sam's music is filled with clairvoyance and passion, he carries you away with his melodies, whether it's couples discovering each other, taking a journey to calm the mind, or igniting our self-awareness. Without a doubt Sam's music reflects from an innermost space within his soul, you feel the emotions, the integrity, the passion. The arrangements are truly beautiful and take on a ""Cinematic"" expression, you feel yourself within the music and becomes visual and quite inspiring. I would highly recommend this cd it's a beautiful escape for yourself or sharing it with someone close to your heart."
1,Looks Promising but Isn't,"I thought my daughter would love this toy when she got it for Christmas. Instead it has gotten tossed aside. Even when it was new to her, she paid little attention to it. The fish make sounds which is nice and I thought she would like that because she is very auditory. However, she has taken little notice of it. The squeaker is impossible for small hands to manipulate. Although this toy is colorful, it has gone unnoticed by my little girl even when she was an infant (and even when the toy was carefully demonstrated and brought to her attention)."
3,yes and no,"While I agree with Mr. Breeding on his stand against medicating children and doing whatever it takes to find a workable solution, much of his philosophy is impractical and unrealistic. I admire his courage though and a lot of what he says rings true for me."
2,I wish I had known it was Scientology related . . .,"Some valuable and unique insights on the problems we face with regard to public education. However, the strong anti-medication stance taken by the author is overkill, and one should not let the affiliation with the Citizens Commission on Human Rights and the quotes from L. Ron Hubbard go unnoticed."
2,A very klunky translation with some good moments.,"I regret ordering this. Though not familiar with either Soseki Natsume, or the translator Sammy Tsunematsu, I found my debut to both of their work disappointing. Though completely unfamiliar with the Japanese language, I am familiar with good writing, especially in short stories and vignettes. These prose pieces have very unskilled, unattractive places that spoil the whole. I can't believe those blemishes occurred in the original, because of Natsume's great reputation. For diverse reasons, it must be a very poor translation. I do not recommend this work because of it."
5,DOS MILAGROS REALES...,"bajo la mano de un médico QUE CREE EN DIOS..Una chica con aneurismas múltiples...Y SU PROPIO HIJO, PARALIZADO Y QUE AHORA CAMINA Y CORRE !"
3,Good ideas in a techo filled world.,"I remember a lot of these activities growing up, but the kids today have never heard of many of them. Great time fillers when working with many kids at multiple levels. ME4E will definitely use them in their up coming programs."
1,What a Joke,I think it is hilarious that the only books the other reviewers seem to have read are all by this author. What a joke.
4,Stories in a gravel voice,"I am always impressed by Tom Waits' descriptive ability - the way he paints vignettes of people and places and moods. His early work on the Asylum label is generally more accessible than later stuff like Bone Machine and here the listener finds Waits in a gentle frame of mind on a tasty selection of mainly soft ballads and jazzy numbers like Blue Valentines and the duet I Never Talk To Strangers. I prefer his country style ballads so Tom Traubert's Blues (Waltzing Matilda) and Ruby's Arms are my favourites. This is a good introduction to his bluesy musical vision contained in that gravely voice and his evocative story songs, but I think it would have been better if masterpieces like The Piano's Been Drinking (Not Me), I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You, Old 55 and Saving All My Love For You had been included. I also recommend his albums Heartattack And Vine, Swordfishtrombones and Mule Variations."
5,Amazing Book! Lots of Fun to Read!!!,"This is a wonderful book! It goes through all the basic techniques of film making from writing your script to camera angles to lighting, and gives great encouraging advice to future girl directors. There's even a little history at the begining that tells about the woman directors from the past. I really enjoyed this book!! It's so much fun to read and is so encouraging! Any teens interested in movie making will love this book! I know I do."
1,"I love Bark magazine, but this book is BAD BAD BAD","Bark magazine is a good magazine, mixing informative articles and touching stories. I had high hopes for this Bark book, given its excellent ""pedigree"". Unfortunately, this book is an EXTREME disappoint. This book has just 2 or 3 good stories. The remaining stories are preachy, poorly-written, moralistic tales. I like reading about DOGS, not self-serving autobiographical psychobabble. If this book interests you, save your money and subscribe to Bark magazine instead!"
1,not intended for dog lovers,This book was given to me as a gift by a well-meaning friend who knows I am a lover of dogs. Had she known the sadness between the covers I'm sure she would have chosen another book. Why a dog lover would want to read countless stories about how human carelessness caused their dogs to be hurt or even killed is beyond me. Have people ever considered keeping their dogs on leashes? The majority of the book was much too sad- the happy stories were definitely in the minority. I highly discourage anyone from purchasing this book.
1,Pues vaya decepción...,"Yo es que no he leido nada de Gonzalo Torrente Ballester hasta este momento, pero es que este libro me ha decepcionado una barbaridad, en parte por el prestigio que tiene el autor. Es una novela plana, en la que no hay argumento. Un par de chicas huérfanas, Cristina y Chon, regresan a su pueblo natal a vivir con su tía. Las chicas se ponen a trabajar, Chon se echa novio, su reputación se va a la porra gracias a los comentarios de una envidiosa conocida, el novio la deja, Cristina se marcha a otro país, la tía se muere, Chon alquila un piso a la calumniadora (fíjate, ahora tan amigas), y termina casándose con un admirador de su madre. Hay situaciones sin resolver, caracteres que aparecen y desaparecen sin desarrollo alguno, en fin, una trama muy flojita que me ha dejado con mal sabor de boca. Con un título tan chulo, me esperaba otra cosa."
5,U.S. History from a decidedly Christian perspective.,"A well researched history of the United States of America from the revolution to the Civil War. Delivered in a narative form, the authors make history come alive. They manage to put flesh and blood on the men and women of our ""manifest destiny.""Read how America and americans were shaped by their deep rooted belief in the God of the Bible. The circuit riding minister and the pulpit bound preacher were instrumental in the development of the character of our nation.This rates as a ""page turner"" which the avid history buff and the casual student will both find difficult to put down."
4,Check Into It,"I liked this book better than The Light And The Glory. It is true, and must be admitted by those who look at history objrctively, that the Christian religion has had an enormous impact on the course of events in the United States . . . much more so than secular historians would have us believe. My favorite part was the minute account of the Second Great Awakening - particuarly the revival meetings in Kentucky. But these books, in and of themselves, are not going to give an individual a balenced view of U.S. history. It is just too biased. The authors have attempted to put a religous construction on all key events, and on all key men behind those events. Too much gloss. But you won't regret reading it. It's good reading, and I learned a lot from it."
2,Very Lightweight,"This is a very light bracelet and is not suitable for the true jewelry collector. I think it would be great for a kids charm bracelet, but not as a gift to your mother-in-law ;0). I am not educated in the GOLD lingo, so I did not realize how small it was until I received it. After going out and really doing some research, you will need to spend around $200 to get a decent gold bracelet. Just my opinion...but a little more info would have helped me."
5,Decent little practice amp.,"This amp is a nice basic practice amp. Entry level priced. Decent enough sound for practicing, and it can get loud enough. Features the standard amp adjustments (bass, Treble, master volume) headphone out, and one mono input. Does have an overdrive button which boost the sound up, seem to even ad a bit of distortion. But, can't ask for much more in a basic entry amp, serves it purpose well, decent price, and compact."
5,Excellent!,"This compilation embodies the true spirit of postonove. For anyone who has sat in that spot rolling baseados, this is for you!"
5,Very good deal,I received the ToteLok Plate Mounts very fast and at a very good price. I will shop with this seller again.
1,BURL IVES,Cd has very poor sound quality...The songs are great just the sound is rated 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. Very poor sound....
3,umm you get what you pay for,this can opener was very inexpensive and it is what it is. leaves large cuts on the can covers that are dangerous. its very last century and so is the price. it does what it is supposed to do. but its frustrating at times trying to get the can to catch. i do like the sharpeners in back of the opener. if you dont open lots of cans and i dont. this can opener is fine.
1,Garbage,very disappointed in this product I have thrown the product away not even good enough to give to Goodwill. Doesn't have enough power to even open small cans. Amazon did give me a refund. Do not buy!!!
1,no stallion !!!!!,vhs tape arrived in box and jammed/unwound immediately after inserting it into vcrand pushing play...total crap ... Zero stars !!!!!!!!!!
1,will not work to connect to Cisco2610,"and the mini cd (for drivers)is placed inside the cardboard, so most people probably throw them away. I had to contact cust svc, and when they told me where to find it, I laughed!!! And all the drivers are not named 'windows 7' or 'windows xp'..you have to guess which one to load, or load all of them. It might work for other devices...who knows??"
3,The cable works as it should.,"There have only been a couple of problems with this unit. I have gotten the BSOD (Blue screen of death), in Windows7 32bit twice while using this cable out of many uses, and always when the router reboots without disconnecting the cable from the console port. Otherwise it has worked just as it is supposed to."
4,RS-232 DB9 Adapter Cable,I bought this adapter to connect a ecm code scanner to my laptop to record auto doc./billing. After reading reviews I almost didn't buy it from driver problems with Vista noted in reviews. I had no problems at all loading and using the Db9 adapter .It has worked for me ok.
3,USB-to-RS232 adapter,Unfortunately this particular cable did not work out for me.The drivers or the cable itself just couldn't quite get me the distance I needed it to go. I tried 2 other cables of this exact model- no dice!The vendor however worked really hard to satisfy my need but in the end the cable just did not suffice.
5,"Great Item, and Cheap",This is very useful for those laptop that don't come with a serial port for those serial console you need to connect...cheap and realible.
3,"Works as advertised, not exactly the same as the picture","The product that I received works as advertised on a Windows XP machine. However, it was not the exact product depicted in the picture. As was mentioned by a previous reviewer, Vista drivers are available for the cable pictured. However, Vista drivers are not available for the product that was shipped to me. If you are using Vista, I would recommend purchasing a product that guarantees compatibility with Vista. If you are an XP user, this cable should work for you."
5,Works great on my Sony Vaio SZ-series laptop,"I was a little concerned at its very cheap price, but it works wonderfully. The enclosed software installed it at COM8 and I've been serially consoling into Cisco equipment ever since via my laptop's USB port. What can I say - it works as it's supposed to!"
1,Horrible!,"Like many other XP users, tried it. Went through the setup and it was recognized as Prolific USB-to-Serial Bridge (COM3). Tried to hook it up to my device that uses a serial port and it was never recognized. If you have XP, I suggest not buying this product."
1,Good as a brick,"As some of the other people have mentioned, it looked good, the reviews looked like there was a chance it might work, so I took a chance and bought two.I expected cheapo packaging and no intructions (I thought ""Hey, I know my way around a computer with a blindfold on, I can make it work""), but I also expected the device to work. That was apparently a little too much.Neither of the devices worked -- tried 3 different computers, my Win XP Pro laptop, my Linux desktop and a WinXP home machine at work. Never mind drivers, the device simply is not recognized by any of the 3 operating systems.Gah, I knew it was too good to be true. Next time I'm going to Microcenter and buying it locally even if it costs $30."
1,NO!,Never worked from get go! bought it for my brother and he didn't use it right away. The cable is defective but the return period has already expired. I know how to install drivers in case you are wondering and troubleshoot computer problems.
1,Not as pictured,"I bought this because I previously had a USB to Serial adapter which looks EXACTLY like the one in the photo, and I loved it. It used the very common FTDI chipset. I work in IT, and have to use a USB to serial adapter with all sorts of operating systems (everything from Windows and Mac to older Linux and Solaris). Well, this showed up, and not only does it not use the FTDI chipset (which makes it useless to me, since pretty much everything has the drivers for the FTDI installed), but it doesn't look a thing like the one in the photo."
1,Probably counterfeit,"This thing costs 1/4 of a prolific 2303, drivers came on a mini cd with chinese writing and my AV unsurprisingly shows it contains a trojan. I was trying to get this thing to work for an upcoming cisco test and it simply won't work, drivers are missing or loaded with malware and the cable has no markings on it at all."
1,nice garbage product not work,"XP/Win7 doesn't know how to get the driver, find dekcell web said work till XP, not driver available for download.Don't buy!"
2,Shipment,I can't provide a review to this product I purhcased because I have not received this item to date (1/3/11). My review is I got charge but no product.
3,something wrong with the product,I could not make the adapter work. I finally bought a usb to serial adapter from local shop that worked perfectly fine.
1,Cheap and cheaply made,Device is very cheap and one gets what one pays for. The drivers included with the shipment were not readable and without a real brand name it was a matter of hunting down the chip maker. Drivers were finally found and loaded but the so-called RS232 interface was not compatible with some of the controlled devices that once worked when computers had real communications ports rather than USB.I would not recommend this item for anyone. Spend the money and get a real USB-RS232 converter and let this company's product rust on the shelf.USB to Serial RS-232 DB9 Adapter Cable
2,NOT WORKING SO FAR,"Well this is one very cheap solution: No information, no drivers at all, windows xp and windows 7 just recognize it but does not install it. the driver after a brieff research can be found at, but id does not help too much.I installed it on my Windows 7 but i got this message: This device can not start (Code 10) so i tried in an XP with the same answer. so far i have not conected any thing to it, but as far as my research goes, it sinply does not start.WIll try different solutions and post it"
1,Not a winner for me,I purchased this item to use with a current (8.04 LTS) Ubuntu system. Other USB to serial adapters work out of the box with the built-in drivers. This unit transmits and receives but the characters are garbled making it useless. Had I known this in advance I would not have purchased this unit. Purchased a replacement from a different vendor which works fine.
1,Dont was your money1,"Terrible Product, drivers dont install properly, works when it wants to. Dont waste your money, just buy a PCIE Card with port you need"
1,Does not work,This must be a Chinese knock-off. It is not supported by the Driver included or the driver on the supposed manufaturer website. I found one at Radio Shack that worked perfectly the first time.
3,It Served It's Purpose!,"It's not the greatest thing you could do to save the front end of your car, but the quickest and most convenient. The bra never quite fit perfect. I've had it almost a year and it still has a creese that won't come out. It ripped in a couple of spots while I was installing it. And this was after I let it sit in the sun for awhile to loosen up for installation."
1,Six awards for this bizarre narrative?,"This is a badly written book. ts fantastic imaginary world efface authors thinkings about war, God, human or being. Actually there are not any important ideas at all worth to consider. Germain' or her characters' claims about God do not deserve any serious theodicy. Prussians and Germans transform metaphysical enemies(of France),beyond their historical identities. The plot full of incests. Poor reader hardly follows ill-omened genealogy...Language and narration also corrupts throughout the book."
2,poor quality product,"I bought this one for my 2 year old girl, who is a cat lover.When the cat arrived, it was ok, although not look as sleek and nice as othe stuffed animal I own. Anyway, my daughter still seems like it and played it a while.I put it in the washer and dryer to clean it as I usually do for my other stuffed animal. The washed cat now looked like a wild cat with all its hair curling and dangling, the whole cat look like a brown cotton ball, not cute at all.My daugher did not even touch it since it was washed."
2,Not a Calico,"This stuffed kitty is soft and cute, but the picture is not accurate. The ""Jumbles"" that I received is orange and brown, without the traditional black, orange and white splotches characteristic of an actual Calico. (I did double check, and the label says Calico).I was bummed. My husband and I just separated and my son misses our Calico kitty Molly. I was really excited to unveil a stuffed animal that looked just like her. Instead he just got a random cat."
1,This Ty - Jumbles cat is a fire hazard,"I got this toy for my grandchildren a while ago and put it in the dryer with damp laundry to fluff it up for a bit. The cat came out totally singed and smelling very badly of burned fur. Needless to say, I didn't give it to my granddaughter. I complained to the manager at the Ty Customer Service line and he wouldn't have any of it. He said all toys have been tested and are perfectly safe !!!! Well, this one isn't, if it can't be put in the dryer. Another cat ""Aurora Tux Flopsie"" was allright, nothing happened, it was nice and fluffy after being in the bag for 6 months"
2,Not like in the picture,"Speedy delivery, but the picture did not match the product...the bodysuits were shortsleved not long sleved! Not very helpful in the winter."
2,Now I can finally get this out of my head!,"Just like everyone else that has reviewed this movie I was eleven years old when I saw this one on TV. For some reason (it probably has something to do with Connie Sellecca in a swim suit) it stuck with me. Now that I am in my 40's I am happy to say that I got to see it again on DVD and I can put this one behind me. The story is a mess. The acting is really bad. The dialogue is terrible. But, I am happy I got to see it again. Weird ..."
2,The Bermuda Depths,"Unfortunately, this turned out to be NOT the real dvd. Someone made a copy and sold it. This was sad."
5,Cult Classic,"I've loved this movie since age 9. Even though this movie came out in 1978, the mastering was so well done it looks recent. It's creepy and haunting, but sweet."
4,Bermuda Depths,"If you like made for Tv on a small Buget movies, this Buds for you. It's Blue lagoon meets Moby Dick. Conney Selleca (Hotel series) is Beautiful as ever. Campy yes but as fantasy made for Tv movies go it's a keeper. I love my B movie collection."
3,Ruined in the last reel.,"The first three quarters of this movie are great, they're filled with mystery, magic, and romance. Connie Sellecca is stunning, as usual. But, the last quarter of the film ruins it for me. It's filled with bad special effects, ridiculous situations, and a very unsatisfying ending. All this changes the movie from a 'many viewed classic' to a one time watch."
3,Glad I finally found it,"Just like the other reviewers, I saw this movie on TV in 1978 and was captivated. For YEARS I would explain the movie to people trying to find it, and everyone thought I was nuts. I'd say, ""You remeber the carl Weathers movie with the giant Sea Turtle..."" Everyone said ""NO"" and looked at me like I had 3 heads.Finally.....I did a Google search on Carl Weathers and finally found the movie.I agree..no academy award winning acting or special effects. But if you saw it as a child in 78, you look past all of that and can enjoy the movie once again."
4,"Right Place, Right Time, Right Age","Almost everyone who loves this movie was between the ages of 7 and 10 in 1978, when this TV movie aired. We all share the same stories. Vague memories of a girl and a boy on a beach and a giant turtle. Was it a dream I had or was this something I actually saw on TV? To revisit this movie was a pleasure. It is not for today's audiences though, You had to be at the right age, and lucky enough to have seen it in '78.Don't be swayed by the on demand dv-r notice. My copy looks like a regular dvd with case, cover and disc. The picture was actually stunning! I didn't know what to expect given the films age. I was pleasantly suprised.Relive a part of your childhoop through this little movie if you were lucky enough to have seen it as a child. If this movie has haunted your memory as it did mine, you will be happy to revisit."
2,Not satisfied,"I have Calphalon pans and I hardly ever use them because you have to be so careful how you cook. The heat has to be just right, you can't use spray on oils such as Pam, food sticks if you put the food in while it is cold, if the heat isn't just right food sticks too. Very frustrating for me. I LOVE to cook, but I regret buying these pans!"
4,Excellent sound effects for a tropical backdrop,"I listended to all kinds of effects tracks--thank you Amazon for the preview feature!! I was looking for something that would give me a jungle bird background effect for my home tiki bar during a party. I wanted something that had birds and jungle sounds but not too much high pithed insect noise or rain, etc. This was a good fit. For my party, I put it on a loop and it lent the exact atmosphere and I even got some compliments on the background sounds!"
4,Price and quality,"I ordered these ink cartridges based on price alone, but I was pleasantly surprised when they out lasted the original HP product! I am still using the 1st set of cartridges that I ordered and I am very satisfied with both price and performance. Hey HP, take a lesson here!!! I will reorder when I need more ink."
1,Not Smokey or Original Songs,"These are great songs, but this is not Smokey as the lead singer or the original songs. Its only one Smokey and you won't hear it on this CD. I'm not sure who the singers are on this CD."
2,"3 Orginal Tracks, rest are covers. A Rip Off","This has three tracks (including Walk Don't Run) of Ventures tunes. The rest are covers of other top-40 instrumentals (La Bamba, Wipeout ...). This is not a collection of the Ventures best tunes. The covers are okay, but not better than the originals. I thought I was getting a full collection of Ventures tunes, not cheesy retreads. Fool me once ..."
2,not original 1960's material!,Do not be fooled like I was! This is NOT the early 60's versions of these great songs! There is nothing wrong with the sound quality or anything else however if you are a fan of original hits this is NOT what you want. These songs could have been played by anyone. I do believe it was the actual Ventures but the historic importance is not there...
4,Great sufing music,This CD has a few of my favorites. I like the clean guitar music. These songs are great for driving in the car with the window down.
2,Less than I had Remembered,Bought this cd along with the Chantays' Pipeline. This has more recognizable tunes that seem curiously flat after all these years. They sound better in the hi-fi of memory.
2,Best Of The Ventures,"Audio is not good, And I am a fan of the Ventures, and would not recommend it because of poor sound quality!"
5,So happy with this cd,"I searched a long time and have older albums of the Ventures, and when this cd arrived, it was all I could want of the best songs the Ventures performed."
1,Not worth the money.,"One of the attractions Casio touts about this watch is its illuminated face.The illumination of this watch, unlike earlier versions, is so dim as to render it virtually useless."
1,Casio Men's Databank Digital Watch # DBC62-1,Bought this watch to replace another Casio of higher value that broke. Did buy the cheaper one since I do not use all the Telememo and Phone functions in the replaced one. Watch major drawback is the night light illumination. It is very faint and illuminates only from the left side of the dial making reading of the minutes very difficult...would not recommend for this shortfall.
5,My Favorite Watch-not too clunky for a woman!,I've worn this style of Casio watches for many years. This style is the more compatible with the feminine wrist size. I work in a job in which I use all the watch functions. I need it so much that I bought two because I tend to scratch up the crystal. The keys are flush with the crystal and can't snag on sweaters. This makes for a smooth feel and sleeker look. I use the alarm clock every day and it is loud enough to wake me. The functions are easy to set and the light is bright. I feel naked if I go out the door without it.
5,Great slim watches.,"I had this watches for a long time. Really, really nice, slim and stylish.The only concern is about light. It doesn't cover the whole area of the dial."
3,Information Only,"This book is not worth the listed price. School bookstores will have it cheaper, but still the material is outdated and not well written. It the reader's intent is purely academic it is a good sourse of information and numbers, but will not enlighten them on the subject."
4,A very nice Playset,"I personally had the honor to buy this Royal Starship Set and I must say that the detail quality in the ship is truly maginificent. From the controls of the Royal starship to it's ""battling"" sounds, it's truely a very detailed ship. You can probably fit more than seven action figures in the ship. It comes exclusively with a red R2D2 action figure which is a plus also since it's going to be a highly collectible item in the Episode One series. But i must say for any star wars fan, this is a really good collectible ship even though it will take a lot of space in your present Star Wars collection, so make room for it if you decide to buy it!"
5,SUPERB!,"What can I say the fine folks at Hasbro/Kenner, have really outdone themselves this time! I have been a closet star wars collector for years (yes even in the times when star wars wasn't cool) and for my buck this is the coolest vehicle/playset this side of the galaxy since the classic Millenium Falcon! Great sounds, great play value, and not to mention great price! The engineering behind this toy will keep kids busy for hours on end, and will be the prime piece in anybody's collection. Great fun, and thats what every toy should be. MUST BE OPENED! to cool to keep in the box!"
3,Rushed ending to a decent series.,"I enjoyed the Lon Nolan series and bought all of the books, even though they sometimes made you wonder why such a low tech approach to warfare was used. This is fiction after all so I don't get too picky. Most of this book was decent but the ending seemed so rushed. Like others, I expected there to be a book called General to finish the series, and was really looking forward to it since it would have involved an attack on Dirigent (the mercs home planet.) It seems like at the last minute Shelly decided not to do this and wrapped up the entire future of Lon in a few pages. That part sorely dissapointed me. I feel there is nothing worse than to end on a bad note, you tend to remember that more than what you enjoyed about the series and makes me not all that eager to read his other books. Too bad, I tend to be a very loyal reader."
2,A tepid culmination to a tepid series,"Despite the title, I must add that this is the best book in the overall Nolan sequence. He actually seems to have grown as a character, although only to the extent he is 2.1 dimensional rather than two dimensional. The combat seems a bit more sophisticated, actually employing combined arms for a change. The best possible book in the series, the ""General"", is the one that will not be written. Here we could have seen the implications of a military officer as head of state, grappling with tough decisions that effect soldiers and civilians alike and perhaps offered a broader glimpse of politics and foreign relations in Shelley's series universe. Unfortunately that topic is dealt with in a paragraph."
3,"Overdeveloped body, Underdeveloped voice","There is quite a bit to recommend in this collection of Mamie Van Doren songs, especially for lovers of nostalgia and camp, but if anyone is so misguided as to hope to find this collection remotely listenable, I suggest you avoid ""Lifetime of Love"" (my ears are still bleeding) and ""Nobody but You."" She actually tries to carry a tune on these tracks and the results aren't pretty. She's better served by the light 50's bop and novelty songs which require little of her vocally. Like her contemporary, Jayne Mansfield, Mamie knew how to put over innocently smutty ditties with simple melodies. In the case of both ladies, their sizable ""lungs"" never came in handy when it came to real singing. For fans only."
5,Great product; great price.,"This is a heavy cargo bag. It has plenty of space, a large zipper, button snaps and large handles. I plan to purchase more of these bags."
3,it is nice,I chose a three star because I just got it so I do not know how it will hold up. The bag seems well made and bigger than I expected.
5,Sturdy Bag,"This bag is about the largest bag you can put in an overhead space on a plane. It is very sturdy, and can hold much more than you may think it can. There are not many frills such as separate zipper compartments, but for me that makes the bag better because it makes it roomier."
3,Some good things ...,"For us , Bruce fans , it is not easy to hear his songs in someone else's voices . In fact , I believe , it is quite a hard job to record a Bruce song . Anyway , some of these guys , just did it ! I can mentionn "" From small things "" and "" Fire "" are really great . It is strange to hear other people singing it , but specially "" Fire "" is really good , and you will like it ( even if you aren't a Brucie fan ) . All the rest are ... basic ."
4,"A sharp, unsparing honesty","These autobiographical essays can be returned to again and again for the beauty of the writing and the startling frankness of the writer. The earlier essays explore the experiences that shaped her - trips to her beloved France, caring for an aging and difficult father, lifelong regret over an impulsive rejection of her sister, musings on literary characters, minor thieving, incidents that retain their emotional charge over decades.The second half of the book is a portrait of her own aging and increasing illness - her rages, fears and love of life. Whether baring her soul or keeping a whimsical distance, Fisher's writing has an immediacy that connects with the reader."
4,Still indispensible after nearly a century,"Samuel Driver was the outstanding Bible scholar of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and this book is among his finest achievements. Although first published nearly 100 years ago, it is a font of information still not readily available elsewhere and remains the finest available commentary on Deuteronomy. Of course, it must be used with some caution, but it has stood the test of time remarkably well. For chapters 1-11, there are commentaries by Duane Christensen and Moshe Weinfeld, and Christensen's commentary on the rest of Deuteronomy should appear soon, but Driver will still retain some value for the foreseeable future."
2,"Music ok, hardware not very nicely done.","This is a review of the vendor, not of the music itself, which is amazing! About the vendor: the Recording itself is ok, the CD itself seems to be homemade, the booklet was not included (I really would have liked it). There was one small glitch in one of the pieces, thankfully not in the piece I was most concerned with when I bought the CD. I got the music I wanted, so I am happy about that, but the CD is not exactly a gem in my collection."
4,Real Deal,"Spare, bare and amazing. What a time capsule! Steve Stills charts the future with his work...Almost all of CSN's best music you hear on this cd in the raw form and it gives you chills. I had to hold back a star because his falsetto on some cuts doesn't fit.."
3,Gotta be a diehard Stills guy,"Stephen Stills is my favorite rock musician,not as a singer but a songwriter and guitarist.The interest here is strictly historical,some pieces are unformed and all are raw.My appreciation is recognizing and admiring the work this artist took from simple chords and words ""written on scrap paper"" to the masterpieces some of these songs became."
2,Not so hot,"While I'm a huge fan of Stephen Stills' early work with Buffalo Springfield and CSN(Y), this tape of rough solo demos is not worth the $$. It's interesting to hear the songs performed this way, but not a revelation. The sound is just ok and the performances are too."
1,Cutting Room Floor,"Okay, so I was once a fan of CSN, and am still a fan of Buffalo Springfield, so I figured I'd give this one a shot. I was very disappointed. Yes, you can hear how the songs evolved, but for me, these outtakes are better left on the cutting room floor. I quickly got rid of this after listening to it once."
5,"Interesting peek into a period of time, and a songwriter's mind.","The liner notes, brief as they are, tell you that Stephen Stills paid a recording engineer to roll tape while he played some songs he had worked on. He was in New York for a recording session by Judy Collins. The quality of the recording itself is indifferent, but hearing a player and songwriter of this level, in his prime, working through material that would change the music world is priceless. Suite Judy blue eyes (written for Judy Collins) sounds so fresh with just one voice, and songs like Treetop Flier or Helplessly hoping are rough cut gems. This is a must have for fans of CSN or people interested in music from that period of time."
5,A Master at Work,"WOW!! This is truly a long lost treasure! An acoustic studio session recorded after a Judy Collins recording session. Stills is just beginning to reach the height of his powers, Buffalo Springfield is breaking up and CSN is yet to be. These ""demos"" are more powerful than most of what passes for music today. It is interesting to listen to these grittier versions of ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes"" and ""Helplessly Hoping"" and compare them to the more polished CSN versions. This ""American Idol"" generation of listeners may not get the ""singer/songwriter"" generation , so if you are looking for something slick, look elsewhere. BUT if you want see inner the workings of a man who help change the face of rock music for a generation this is a great entre."
4,"The artist, the art",Strip away the overdone studio effects and you get the artist performing his art. A little rough but still a gem.
4,interesting,"As in it was interesting to hear these songs, before they were cleaned up. Had a raw sound to them. Charles A. O'Mara"
5,The Intense Mr Stills,"I have been listening to Stephen Stills for 40 years, and I am always ready to hear any of his works. I once read that he is so intent on giving a great performance that he ""hurls"" before his performances. Whether it was Buffalo Springfield, CSN, CSN&Y, Manassas or any number of collaborations. This disc is the glue that held and holds all of them together. There are very few that deserve the title of musical genius, and Mr. Stephen Stills is one of those."
4,Heads-up on the sound quality....,"Lots of good comments already written...But heads up again on the tape hiss - it's thick - & heads up on the guitar distortion. Fine on the finger-picked songs like ""Helplessly Hoping"" - but noticably distorted on the strummed or flat-picked songs.Obviously not recorded for official release - or meant for the mainstream music market - but still great that it's seeing the light of day!Just be aware that it's not at all clean."
3,For The Love Of Judy,"Obviously, Mr. Stills did not set out to make definitive versions of these songs. He just wanted to get them down before he forgot anything, and to work on them with Mr. Crosby.However, it's a fascinating glimpse into the process that took place, and a rare chance to hear Mr. Stills pre-production. With the exception of the first CSN album, his work was often over-produced, so to hear him in raw form is refreshing.99.9% of all the songwriters in this world would die to have written this batch of songs. Any body of work that would lure Neil Young into your band would have to be pretty astounding, and so it is.Much love and prayers go out to Stephen in his fight against prostate cancer."
4,A great bit of musical history,"Steven Stills before all the coke, drugs and booze. It's liked sitting there listening to someone find their own sound - I really enjoyed listening to some old favorites in their raw stage. A must-have for any serious Stills fan."
5,The Confessions Tour -Live from London(CD+DVD) Review,"WOW!!! I wish I could have attended this concert. I have to say that this concert is probably better than Her Re-Invention Tour...which I did attend. This woman, who is pushing 50, is so incredible that she can out dance her own dancers who are 2times younger than Her. This dvd is awesome. You will not be disappointed!!!!!"
5,At Her Best,"This woman is constantly recreating herself and this album and DVD is proof that she is still ahead of her time and always will be. Kudos to you, Miss Madge."
5,Beyond greatness,"I was at this show when it was filmed in london and all i will say is this, shere brilliance, the best live show ever produced."
5,THE BEST,You get a live audio CD and a live concert DVD. Both are really great. If you didnt get a chance to see Madonna on tour pick this up. Very well put together. Great sound quality and very entertaining.
4,Excellent :),"Very nice and excellent dvd. The shipping for this item also very fast even though I m from Asian. There""s only one thing. The dvd cover is very simple. But it doesnt mean I didnt like it. All my friends also enjoy and like it. They also want to have this dvd."
1,Why Is this out?,"Please don't buy this until the Reinvention tour comes out on DVD. Why is this coming out first. what is wrong the the people at WBR. So we got a movie, with no real point, and no RIT dvd. What was the point of i'm going to tell you a secret? That religion is not even allowed to be discussed!!! But who cares about tradition. So we have to listen to her go on about how rich she is and watch some boys hold hands, to quote bette davis, ""what a dump"" Grow up madonna and think of your fans for once. furthermore the cd should have been the studio versions. or demos. it is sad that for anything rare we have to download it."
3,Madonna Confessons Tour,"I really enjoyed this dvd, I was at Madonna's concert in San Jose in California and wasn't very close so seeing the dvd got me to see it all over again and see things much better.ThanksTalia"
3,Too much flash.,Well. I loved the music on the CD/DVD but the concert came off as too produced. I bought this with the concert she did in France in mind and I hoped it would be like that one. Where's the sweat!?! I understand that it's the first concert in the tour so the kinks got worked out later on. I would've liked less cutting in of the concert with the special effects. It was distracting and made the concert choppy but Madonna looked great!
5,Nobody does it better,"I watched the DVD of the concert and as usual with Madonna was blown away by the level of professionalism, energy, crowd-pleasing, crowd-abusing (which everyone also loves), art and hard work that she puts into her work. With all the hype about Madonna and her life, it is easy to overlook the fact that this woman works like a horse and should be congratulated for it. Top notch show and please don't tell her to stop."
2,Dissappointed,Was looking forward to receiving this dvd but unfortunately it is not good.The cd is fine but the dvd constantly jumps throughout the concert.Not watchable.
2,Excelent!,"The DVD excelent conditions, but in the music one track doesnt work....Well I dont expect so much because it was used....But The Confessions Tour its the best of Madonna!!!..."
3,A very cold performance,"After watched four times,I realized the madonna's confession tour is very cold.Yeap!! she has the most amazing stage ever built!!! but the performance looks cold and boring.....I will stick to the cds..."
2,Who put this mess together?,I would think the hardest working Pop star would employ a better production team to compile such a wonderful concert. The DVD extras are piss poor. The camera quality and slow-mo matrix like effects throughout are overused and very 90's. Being the Tour was international and played countries that haven't seen her in years it would have been smart to incorporate some of that footage or fan footage if any was even taken. This DVD doesn't do the concert any justice Live. What a waste of money.
1,I don't recive mi product,"I don't receive the DVD madonna confenssion tour, I wanna to know what happen whit the dvd. when I wil recive I send mi opinion"
4,Great show,"I think the show is amazing but I found the video editing to be too much and distracting.""Live to Tell"" is top notch. If the Christians can't see the beauty in it then maybe they should read the bible with their eyes open."
1,Didn't Work,I chose this rating because the product I received did not work. and I stil have yet to hear from the seller I bought it from concerning the issue.
2,Excellent concert but the DVD editing is annoying,"What an amazing concert! but when you watch the DVD is sooooo annoying. About 3 seconds per shot, specially in the beginning. For a while is OK but then it becames just hard to watch. The editing totally ruined it for me."
5,Remarkable,"First off, the sound and video quality on this collection are first rate. Madonna definitely puts on one of her most rememberable performances. I tend to not be shocked by much these days in terms of music. But this concert is beautiful. I have watched this over and over about 5 different times and cannot get over the sound quality of this DVD/CD combo. I won't detail my favorites, but there are many. Madonna revamps ""Like A Virgin"" in this concert with guitar riffs that really update this song into something worthy of a current release. It sure would fit in on today's radio. Madonna looks great and the images provided throughout are simply breathtaking. I would recommend buying this for the ""Live To Tell"" performance alone. She, once again, shows us all how 1 can affect many. Not just music, but lessons. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,WOW!,I was fortunate enough to see the CONFESSIONS show in Miami. This excellent DVD/CD combo makes me feel like I'm there again. THANK YOU MADONNA!
5,Excellent,Outstanding visuals and performance. One of the best concert dvd's out there. A must have.
5,I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU...ABOUT LOVE!,"In 2005 she wanted to tell us a secret, but lately Madonna has been all about ""Confessions"" and this tour de force from last summer completely delivers! Fans will not be disappointed by this CD/DVD offering and non-fans will be delighted by how amazing this video presentation is - it is top-notch and beautifully shot! The CD is also a great mix but it's noticeably missing some of the shows biggest numbers."
5,Chameleon,"Her chameleon-like persona has always been a big part of Madonna's mystique. Throughout her dazzling, spectacular ""Confessions"" show, Madonna plays many different roles: Disco dominatrix (""Future Lovers""), Acrobat (""Like a Virgin""), Martyr (""Live to Tell""), Glam Rock Star (""I Love New York"") and many others.However, there is a point, about halfway through the show, where Madonna performs a mostly acoustic version of ""Paradise (Not For Me). Sitting on a stool and strumming a guitar, Madonna appears as a middle-aged, slightly melancholy singer-songwriter. And it's the role that seems the most truthful and appealing."
5,"Excelente!!, lo Maximo!!, la mejor gira del 2006 ...","5 estrellas no bastan para calificar a este excelente material producido por Madonna & Jonas Akerlud, la mas exitosa gira del 2006... y creo que la mas exitosa de Madonna en todos los tiempos... Akerlund captura todo el encanto y la magia y nos lleva de la mano junto a la gran diva Madonna... a una mega discoteca donde todo es posible...El segundo Cd en vivo de Madonna: no tengo palabras para describir cada canción en particular hago especial referencia al remake de I feel love permanece muy fiel a la versión original de Donna Summer en los '70s, pero con el toque personal de Madonna fusionando junto a Future Lovers, me hubiese gustado que incluyera todo el concierto en el CD pero bueno... de verdad es una nota escucharloFue una gran adquisición gracias Madonna por brindarnos tu arte..."
5,How about the Controversy???,"Superb Show, Ive heard the CD, and about to watch the DVD. Its great to have an entire Live CD from Madonna. Question, No one has mentioned in the song ""I Love New York"" her change of lines when she tells the Audience what they can do when they go to Texas. I will not repeat them on this posting, for the under 18 crowd!!! And to think, The Dixie Chicks careers were almost ruined for comments that were G rated compared to Madonnas X Rated!!! What did everyone think of these new lines?? They were bleeped by NBC, But the CD is Loud and Clear!! Will she suffer any backlash from Critics???????"
3,A Very Dull Read,"The book is well written but it is a very dull read. Because I had paid money for my copy, I persevered and completed reading it."
2,14 reviews! 14 people have actually read this book?,"In the goal of becoming less of an intellectual lightweight I tackled this book. It starts out slow, then stays slow. I was tempted to quit, yet I pressed on! Grueling page after page. Did I quit? NO! I was determined, I gritted my teeth and persisted.But somewhere around page 150 the book broke me! I just couldn't go on. Has anybody really read this book. I mean really read it? I doubt it. And are there people who read it and enjoy it? No, I can't believe that. I can belive that some people say that they've read it and liked it to show off. But no one could really read this book, much less like it.I give it 2 stars because I didn't suffer enough to give it 1 star. If I'd suffered through the whole thing, then I'd have the moral authority to give it 1 star."
2,Buddenbrooks,"Beautiful writing, unbelievably dated, slow without interest anymore. Was my parents favorite after the war - and I thought they were modern!"
5,One to remember,"Buddenbrooks is an amazing novel, both in scope and its beautifully rendered characters. The story concerns the Buddenbrook family and their life as prosperous merchants in Lubeck in the 1800s. At the beginning, the main characters are Johann and his son Johann, but as the novel continues both die and the focus shifts to the son of younger Johann, Thomas. All the characters are lifelike, each with their own distinct personalities. The most impressive facet of the novel is how true to life it is. The translation is also excellent, the novel is readable and there are few passages that are tough to decipher. Buddenbrooks is quite long, but with the exceptions of some dry parts near the middle it is an exciting and easy read."
4,"Ready to go out of the box, but for smaller calves.","The 16"" Linesman boot is very soft, I was expecting a break in period, but other than getting a little stretch on the instep the leather was work ready.The calf is a bit smaller than I had hoped. My calves are 16"" and that takes the boots to about their maximum width to still have full coverage with the tongue. The stock laces do not make it all the way up the boot due to the extra spread of my calf. They look amazing on."
5,Two thumbs up!,"The Kokopelli Theory held me in suspense from the first page to the last. This was by far the best medical thriller I have read to date. I found the characters to be captivating, the plot fast-paced, and the topic horrifyingly realistic! I highly recommend this book."
5,A SUPER suspense thriller!,"I never have taken the time to write a review, but I felt I HAD to after reading The Kokopelli Theory. What a fascinating premise! The book spins a wonderful suspense involving the origins of the deadly Hepatitus C virus. It was all very convincing, though I know it is fiction. There were excellent twists that made this one of the best reads I've had in ages. This book kept me reading and reading until I finished--In a single sitting! A friend recommended it to me, knowing I loved this genre, and I've been spreading the word ever since. Hard to believe this is Kevin Correa's first novel. He reads like a very seasoned author. I've been checking the listings, hoping for a second book! Thank you Mr. Correa for such a fantastic ride."
5,Excellent seller,Book was exactly as described and arrived in a very timely manner. I am very impressed and would purchase from this seller any time.
1,A Pathetic Polemic,"Great title. I sought this book as potential source material for one I'm writing about documented cases of police and prosecutorial misconduct.Unfortunately, this book's content commits the worst crimes attributed to its targets: broadbrush accusations and biased conclusions without evidence, half-truths, mis-statements of facts and outright lies.In short, these authors have committed a frame-up almost as egregious as instances where authorities have actually railroaded an innocent citizen into prison.The sad fact is, with a little hard work and honest research, these academic fellows could have written a book that used facts to make it credible.Since they didn't, I will."
2,Tranny of good intentions,"Tranny of good intentions was a ground-breaking Danish movie that blurred the borders between pornography and Kierkegaard's moral philosophy... It is surprising to see the title changed by a ""y"" but, nonetheless, very encouraging to read ""good intentions"" as a motivation description of the ""sheeple"", the ""evil government"" and the other enemies of the ""trufers""... Mr Roberts' creation shines with unintentional ironies and unforeseen vignettes of simplistic brilliance..."
1,Ignorance,"The Civil War ended over 150 years ago. Civil rights are now a matter of law. 911 shows us the results of this type of intolerance. Why do these authors attempt to perpetuate a ""racial"" orientation that can no longer be supported? The South no longer ""lives""; it is time to move into the 21st century."
1,Unsatisfied,"Vargas shows no understanding of the music he is singing.Cecilia does.Cecilia Bartoli - If You Love Me (Se tu m'ami ), 18th-Century Italian Songs"
1,He missed the point,"I am sorry I bought this album. I did not listen to the sound bytes first...my bad! Vargas croons his way through music that has been orchestated out of all recognition. It sounds syrupy and sentimental, not intensely emotional. The Carissimi is a joke! The Scarlatti is painful to hear. There are too many fine performances of 17th & 18th century music out there for this to pass muster. For example, if you want to hear Bononcini as he should be sung, listen to Martin Oro or Gerard Lesne. My recommendation is a most emphatic ""NO""."
1,Sore neck and back,"I bought the carrier for its pretty colors! It was good when my baby was very tiny, but as soon as she was 3 months old, the weight distribution left me with a sore back and neck (I couldn't turn my neck for 2 days). I would opt for something more comfortable and forget about what it looks like! I am going to make a homemade Mei Tei instead."
4,Only the Best!,"This book was totally amazing. I needed to do a school project, and the information and pictures really helped me to get deep into learning more about the human body. It was like I had my own personal tutor or helper! It's definietly worth buying... Excellent book that'll last you a lifetime! It had everything about the human body from organs to fun facts! This is like a library all about the human body! And it's not a book that isn't easy to find what you want in it! Buy it today!"
4,Excellent resource,"I own an earlier edition of this book and I have not seen the new one. The recipes I have made are delicious and well balanced. The life-food kitchen part of the book tells about the tools and essential ingredients you will need (juicer, blender, miso, unpasteurized soy sauce, unrefined oils, etc.)The information presented is remarkably informative but not organized in an intuitive manner. Nevertheless this book got me drinking alkalized water and doing a number of other offbeat things which have generally benefitted my health. The book makes many claims about what makes certain foods and practices (such as long, austere cleanses) beneficial yet has no bibliography, so all the information must be assumed to have come from the observations of the authors. I recommend anyone looking at making a radical dietary transformation read Paul Pitchford's ""Healing With Whole Foods"" before doing so."
4,Helpful for those interested in Raw diets,This book on raw diets has recipes as well as valuable theory on how to live a life eating raw and for transitioning to a raw diet.
5,The Grease Band,"I have collected a vast collection of music from the time I first got into music in the 60s as a teenager. This is a very hard album to find, but is a must have for any 60s or 70s rock music lover."
5,A Woman's Guide to Natural Hormones,This is a very good book for general information about the best Hormone Replacement Therapy(versus Hormone substitute Therapy).This book is a must for all women considering HRT-or having hormone difficulties.
5,Great Book!,I bought this book to share with my doctor who is very conventional. I read it and passed it on to her. Excellent source of information about natural hormones.
5,Leon Russell,I Enjoyed hearing these songs from my youth again. Classic songs that never go out of style. Very nice to hear
3,Interesting,"Although I do disagree with the direction that contributors' conclusion, this is an interesting and important little text and well worth a read."
4,Great book,This is one of the best books about Tarot that I've read until now!!!It develops not only the spiritual side but also the intuition!Great book!!!
4,For Those Serious About Tarot,"This book is very useful for those who are not so much interested in the fortune-telling aspect of tarot, but use the cards as tools for introspection. It is a good, basic guide to both the cards and the layouts and it is easily accessible to beginners."
3,Inner reflections with three decks and three authors.,"The thing I like the most about this book is that under each card definition, three types of decks are covered; Aquarian, Morgan-Greer and Rider-Waite. Also, the writers have a statement from the card before they start explaining symbols, etc. Those of you who have read a few tarot books know how dry all this explanation can be, so any change is welcome! As the title suggests, the tarot is discussed in a more inward- searching, spiritual way."
5,It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!,"This book is truly the gem of my library... A beautiful look at the careers of Robert B. and Richard M. Sherman! Reading this book brought back so many memories! Little did I realize that so many of my favorite Disney (and even non-Disney) musical films all had one special thing in common... the music of the Sherman Brothers.This wonderful book is formatted like a huge scrapbook... its fun to read, and just packed with rare photos, cartoons and other memorabilia that would delight any reader."
3,Doesn't Play,"Got the disc quickly and the package was in good condition. However. it didn't play. No big deal -- for a penny, what can one expect. Will try again, but will pay a little more."
4,This is a pretty cool toy,"My son is 3 and he loved getting the sword and mask for his birthday. My one complaint is that the mask didn't fit very well and kept falling off, or shifting so that he couldn't see, no matter how tight I tied it. It would have been better if elastic I think. The sword is definitely cool enough. It makes neat sounds, and he still plays with the sword every day."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"At first this toy was fun and harmless, that soon ended when my 4 year old (who will be 5 this summer) was stabbed in the mouth by his 6 year old cousin. Although the top edge is rounded, the combination of hard plastic and a sharp bottom edge easily makes this toy unsafe. Granted, kids shouldn't hit each other with toy swords, accidents do happen. It's unfortunate that a toy can lead to a trip to the ER and 4 stitches. The hospital staff insisted that my son was stabbed with a knife--not a plastic sword."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"At first this toy seemed harmless and fun-- that all changed when my 4 year old son (who will be 5 this summer) got stabbed in the mouth with it by his 6 year old cousin and thus required a visit to the ER and 4 sutures. Although the top edge is rounded, the bottom edge is sharp. This toy can easily become a weapon since it is made of hard plastic. Needs to be recalled!!!"
4,A very interesting read,"I am quite interested in northern Saskatchewan, the travel routes and the trapping lifestyle and this book was very informative. The writing style makes it easy to read."
1,broken,I got this item by ups and it was cracked internally. The product is most definately going back!
3,my opinion,"the song is very good but like most new singers they sre scared of he mic, snd you cann't hear the words the music drounds out their voice this might not of been the place to say anything but it might help someoneif it isn't i'm sorry dale_read"
1,Stolen,Cover art is a stolen image. No rights were granted to use it. I can not believe the blatant stealing.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED With Smartdisk & Amazon,"NO WHERE did it say or show that the F.M. Radio was a separate contraption that is similiar to what Walmart sells for $1.00 and that you could not use the MP3 Player without it due to the headphones being permanently connected to the radio. Once you hook everything together and put around your neck, youlook like something from Star Wars. Also, the hold button on the MP3 Player came broken, but because I also said that I was dissatisfied with the product, Amazon made me pay for the shipping back!!!"
2,"smartdisk, not!","The product works ok for playing mp3s, but I cannot understand why it was designed to have the FM receiver as a seperate item that has to be plugged into the device. not at all worth the price."
5,Nice headphones,"Good bass and sound quality for the price. I bought these for my 17 year old Nephew for Christmas and he loves them, especially the blue design. All in all, a good purchase."
2,it was good until...,The sound is top notch! very good ergonomics.. Ease of use.. battery life is OK.. compact when you need it pit away until this little knob thingy that holds the headphones together and makes a clicking sound to lock itself gave way!! and I couldn't find that little piece!! wtf! Now u can't lock this POS! there goes my 50 bucks.. unless you super glue it permanently for which it defeats the purpose!! shet!
2,Disappointed This is either defective or a bad piece of equipment.,This is either defective or a bad piece of equipment. Was excited to tryout my new skullcandy headphones. But to my disappointment the sound quality was horrible. I love the looks and they felt very comfortable on my head. It also does not leak any sound out when you have them on so you won't bother people around you. However the most important thing is obviously the sound and it didn't live up to my expectations. The Sub thing feels very much like a gimmick and does a poor job of producing bass. It does a good job of making you physically feel the bass but it sounds very distorted. When you have the subs off the headphones have absolutely no bass at all. Sorry but I am sending mine back.
2,Poor quality headphones with bass booster,"If you're a real bass junkie and you love thudding bass and don't care about the fidelity of the music, and you don't mind tight headphones with an airtight seal around your ears, these are great. If you want comfortable headphones and good sound, move on; you can do better even in this price range. I was stunned by how poor the sound was with the subwoofer off; and pushing the subwoofer up... resulted in muddy, poor quality sound with thudding bass. The subwoofer seemed to have the kind of high quality you'd expect from a tiny lightweight AA-powered unit costing a couple of dollars... I was very disappointed especially after reading these other reviews."
5,Amazing!,"These are the best headphones I have ever owned! The bass in unbeatable and The sound quality is right up there with Bose. Perfect for rap, rock, heavy metal, etc."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased a pair of these headphones a year ago and they have already broken. I expected more from a company that charges $60 for a pair of headphones. It is not like they needed to re-create the wheel. If you do buy these I recommend sending the warranty. Also the option of the headphones collapsing is a horrible idea. Every time I had to pull them off my head, they would pinch my neck and hair."
3,not the best,"well i bought these and i thought they were awesome. as i used them a couple things happened to them 1, i sat on them and one of them broke 2 there is allways a wierd noise they make when u are and are not listening to them 3 you have to contantly change the batteries. i would not recommend these headphones to anyone"
1,skullcandy subwoofer stereo headphone,"this product is a piece of junk. i brought it from this seller name portable guy. when i tried to contact with him throught e=mail and i have not heard from him.the first day when i got this headphone it was brand new. i tried it on ,the stereo sound wasn't good at all. you can get better sound from the one i got from 99 cents store. when i turned on the subwoofer,the sound was getting better. next day when i showed it to my friend, this junk did not work at all. the total of working time was no more than 10 minutes. that was why i tried to contact the seller to get refund or exchange.but this portable guy had never got back to me.i would suggested not to buy from this dealer, it better off to pay little more at bestbuy,when problem arise you can return it within 30 days without any trouble"
5,better than dr. dre's beats!!!!,"i have always been very impressed with skullcandy's headphones. i have their titan ear buds, skull crusher ""on the ear"" headphones and now these skull crushers. WOW....these over the ear phones are incredible to say the least. very impressive!!! they produce exceptional clarity in ever frequency, with the added monsterous powered subwoofer. i listen to every type of music, and in no way are these lacking in any genre of sound. the subwoofer is amazing and i have to actually keep the bass dial on about half of its maximum sound or else its too loud. needless to say, the bass is the best i have EVER experienced from any set of over the ear phones. they are extremely comfortable (I WEAR THEM FOR 10 HOURS A DAY WITH NO PROBLEMS) and they look really cool too!!!THESE HEADPHONES ARE AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN ""DR. DRE'S BEATS"" AND THEY ARE $100 CHEAPER!!!"
4,High rating with daughter.,"Left it up to my 22 year old daughter to rate these, and was pleased by her response. Solid buy."
1,Don't buy,"The only thing good about any skullcandy's are that they look cool. If you are looking for an awesome music experience, buy from another brand. If you are just looking for overrated/priced pieces of junk, stick with skullcandy."
5,Seller was awesome,"I am waiting until Xmas to give the headphones to my daughter, but product seems to be in excellent condition, came quickly, and was a GREAT price!"
2,Skullcrushers Snoop Dogg Black,"Excellent headphones, but mine broke within 2 weeks... sent them back and will probably no reorder them, i hate stuff that breaks quick"
2,Worked great - for about 2 weeks :(,"Very disappointed in these. The headphones worked and sounded great in the beginning, but the subwoofer died after about 2 weeks. They are very comfortable and the noise cancelling is excellent. But without the bass, they don't sound very good anymore :("
1,horrible headphones,worst pair of headphones i ever bought. dont listen to the other commentes because its terrible. the bass is off tune. im not lying i got these today and they suck. im dissapointed in skullcandy. the bass isnt even that good and you can barely hear the music. im getting rid of these and getting sony headphones
1,NOT GOOD FOR BASS AT ALL,One of those hdphones that if you turn up to loud start rattling. sucks dont waste your money. more expensive headphones are worth the cahs
1,DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES IF YOU CARE ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN BASS,"These headphones have no midrange whatsoever. They look cool, but the sound is awful. I should have actually *read* the reviews instead of just looking at the ratings. If you read them, you'll see that many are from younger folks who really only care about the base. Not that there's anything wrong with that...A much better set of headphones for the same price--albeit missing the noise cancelling aspect that come with an over the ear model like the Skullcrusher--is the Koss Portapro."
1,Don't even think about buying,"I purchased this product thinking that he high's, mids and lows would be awesome and clear. Boy was I was wrong dead wrong I am seeing if I can take them back because they sound very muffled sound I tried different EQ settings on my iPod and iPhone and on a computer just trying my hardest to get that crystal clear sound that I get out of my Sony MDR-XB40EX ear-buds and the Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset. But I am very very very disappointed. I am going to return these there not even worth $60+. I wouldn't buy them even for $5.00. so if you wan't to be disappointed go a head and buy them. They can even touch the sound clarity of the Beats and Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ Style Over-the-Ear Pro Headphone PID#8323."
5,Pretty awesome headset,"The headset was overall pretty good for the price, I didn't have any problems with it. They can take quite a bit of rough handling if you don't take good care of things. Mine actually just broke but they lasted a year so I'm pretty happy with that. I will probably buy these once more."
5,Skull Candy headphones,"I ordered SkullCandy headphones for the first time. And I am about Quality of the sound. Let me tell you that this was the first head set that impressed me! It blew me away with the sound. Actually I thought I was sitting in my car. It was a clear sound. You can adjust the base (battery need to be replaced depending how often you use it DONT LEAVE THE BASE ON ""ON""). Fitting over the ears.. great! Im deployed in Afghanistan right now I slept through a couple of Rocket attacks AlarmS- and that is loud! I def suggest you in buying skullcandy headphones. My #1 brand from now on!"
2,Ehh... Kind of a let down,"I have an older pair of on-ear Skullcandy's that have awesome sound and the bass really gives you a great crisp bump. These headphones however are not as good. Essentially everything but the bass is good on these. It doesn't have a natural sound to it at all, it sounds more like a hit from a kick drum when the drum has a hole in it. I would suggest spending your money somewhere else if your looking for in-expensive over-ear head phones. The fit and finish is great but let's be honest, that's not what matters with headphones. Very disappointing coming from Skullcandy."
3,Alright Product,This product was everything I expected and wanted. It arrived on time and in good condition. I would hightly recomemnd this product to a freind.
4,good price,was searching for these headphones after skull candy discontinued manufacture and were hard to find at a decent proce and in the color I wanted-product works great looks good however was missing battery door (small issue considering what I paid)
2,"good for games, not music","The battery powered bass boost has a very limited frequency range, not allowing you to hear the full bass-line in many songs. They sound cool for a while because they are louder but then I noticed the poor sound quality of the base."
3,NOT FOR ALL GENRES! (good 4 rap),"Let's start by saying if you listen to rap, you will love these. If you dont you probably will not.I was very excited when I got these headphones, but was disappointed that the bass mostly only sounds good with hip hop/rap music. This is because the subs only range at a very low frequency, which the music I listen to doesnt have much of. I listen to lots of electronic music (techno, trance, house, drum and bass, dubstep, but not rap), pop/alternative/indie rock and heavy metal. When I turn on the subs the super low frequencies sound unbalanced, and when I turn it off the bass that has a high frequency than what the subs cover is very weak. As a electronic music producer and a non-rap listener, these have failed me. Sennheiser is the audio company for me. I will probably give the skullcrushers to a rap listening friend.If you like to listen to excellent electronic music check out my page: [...]"
4,Exactly what I needed.,Exactly what I needed! Faster shipping than expected as well. Bass hits hard as heck! Comfortable and foldable. Sounds good without the bass on too. Thanks!
4,PURE AWESOME,This product really took me wawy with both its presentation of sound and it swiftness to ship simply agreat productAlthough can get a bit tight on the ear its something to love
2,"bass drowns out the sound, go with sennheiser","the headphones are average. the ""subwoofer"" component isn't very functional, it just produces a loud thumping that sounds segregated from the other sounds. these headphones are overrated."
3,Decent headphones for the price,I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Beats by Dre. They are ok. It comes with an attachment for 1 AA battery which produces the extra bass in the subwoofer. The weight of the batter when attached to an ipod will cause the headphone jack to damage. For the price it is excellent but I had to stop being cheap and go back to Beats by Dre.
3,Alright much better options.,"In my opinion this product is just Ok. Many audiophiles consider skullcandy gimmicky and think the sound quality is horrible. I agree with this, the sub-woofer causes buzzy sounding bass and it muddys up most of the song. They are HORRIBLE for anything like coldplay and if you turn the sub off there is NO bass at all. If you want these headphones take a look at the Sony mdr-xb500 they have clean sounding bass and much better all-around sound quality."
2,Decent.,The bass is really amazing. But for some reason when I would turn the volume all the way up the speakers would cut out on one side and therefore completely ruined the song. Good luck
4,Just fell in love with Skullcandy all over again.,"Skullcandy SCS-SCBP3.5 Skullcrushers Subwoofer Stereo Headphones (Black Pinstripe)Just got my pair of Skullcrushers today and I have to say, they are beautiful (both in appearance and performance). One teeny little problem though, the manual and all of the pictures that I see say that they should come with both a 6.3mm adapter and a dual 3.5mm adapter, but I only received the former and not the latter. That ,and only that, is the reason I have to take off a star :\ , everything else is just as it should be :]."
2,HESH are much better,"I got these cuz they were supposed to have epic bass turns out its just loud muffled high frequency bass that makes your ears hurt. You have turn the bass down if you wanna listen to music for long periods of time, which defeats the purpose. They are made of the cheapest quality plastic! You'd think there something you'd buy at a gas station! and the cord is made of cheep vinyl instead of the rubber that most headphone cables are made with. Skullcandy inkd have much deeper bass and more balanced sound that does not make your ears hurt after long periods of listening. Hesh are much better quality plastic and have a braided cable and sound that you can turn up without destroying you ears. I recommend inkd for bass and Hesh for over ear listening if thats your thing. Anyone who thinks these have good bass have never heard good bass."
4,Good Headphones,These are good over the ear headphones for any teenager or anyone that likes bass. A little pricey but I guess overall worth the money.
3,"Great sound, but break quickly","I've had these headphone for at least two years and they have already broken twice. It seems with wear, the part where they pivot, begins to literally disintegrate over time until it finally breaks off. The first time I was able to fix it with super glue, the second time, not so lucky. Loved the subwoofer, but will not be buying this brand again."
3,skullcandy skullcrushers=waste O' Money,"I bought these on an impulse buy, cheaply.... so i wasn't expecting much; but to my surprise they were worse than i thought. The whole subwoofer thing is ""COOL"" for like the first five minutes out of the box, but then you realize it doesn't hit the lows, overwhelms the sound quality, causes some funny echoing on chorus, and built like $2 paper mache.On the other hand, i couldn't believe the comfort! Really snug and and they fit just right... but no matter the comfort I don't wear garbage on my head!!! I personally own SHURE SRH 750DJ's and sennheiser 555HD so professional sound, Bass is what i want; these headphones don't cut it. If your looking for massive bass i suggest the sennheiser 212, same price range and x1000000000 times better at everything, except the flashy ""Im a Cool Kid, look at my cool headphones"" concept!"
5,Awesome!,Some of the best headphones I've owned. Just remember to turn the subwoofer off when you're not using them. You'll burn through batteries that way!
2,NOt for techno,I have had these headphones for about a month or two at tops and i listen to mostly techno and recently i have had a very annoying noise in my ear from to much bass THESE ARE NOT FOR HARDCORE TECHNO PEOPLE
2,distorted bass,Did not like how the bass was very distorted and hard to listen to.Would not recommend it to anyone.
2,With this Headphone.. Sound doesn't matter.. literally,Listening to this set made me realize that the developers focused more on design (which is decent) rather than the sound.The headphones fit nicely but this thing has the worst sound quality I've ever heard from a pair under $40.00.buy the least expensive Sennheisers if you are looking for absolute sound and get ready to be blown away. These headphones.. I do not recommend them.
5,Present for my Brother,"I bought these headphones for my brother, and had them shipped to his address. They were everything he wanted and it was easy to make the payment and have a different shipping adress. Product was like just bought from the store."
3,Good Headphones if you like bass.,"These headphones are very good if you listen to a lot of bass heavy music, hip-hop, techno, etc. They are very comfortable and portable. The downside is if you like music with less bass, i.e, rock, punk, and indie, the bass is to much. I owned a pair of skullcnady Hesh before this and those worked better for my kind of music.Pros-Comfortable, portableAmazing bassDurableCons-To bass heavy for my tasteExtra battery kind of annoying"
3,Ever blow out the woofer in a pair of headphones?,"For the first couple months, these were okay. All of the sudden, there's now a farting noise every time a deep bass note plays. I don't listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, so I don't know what the problem is. By design, these should be able to handle the bass. I'm going to try to claim the warranty on them, but the fact is I'm still stuck with this headset and I wish I bought a regular pair of headphones.Other than that, the headphones themselves could be a little larger and the cable a bit longer. It's also annoying to have to keep a charged AA battery in with the headset in order to hear bass. Without the bass, the headset is really weak."
4,hurt ears after a while,bass is amazing! love the way these things look.They feel a little fragile and im very carefull when putting them on.After about an hour of listening my ears get very sore and i have to take a break. (maybe i will get used to them with time?)overall excellent.
3,/////////////,"Theae have decent sound quality (not clear/crisp/etc., good if you like overpowering bass, and it can be muddy at times. These are pretty comfortable as well. Good for travel, you can make them smaller and fit them in a bag they come with. The cord for mine got screwed up, and I have to twist it around or it only comes out 1 channel or has poor sound quality. I would recommend looking into buying a different company if you will use these a lot."
5,Great,"I have had Alot of pairs of headphones and these are by far the best. the are really comfy, they fold really compact, the sound great, they have great bass, and if u are watching a movie, they are just like surround sound. these headphones are a must have and i would recommend them to everyone!"
2,not impressive at all,"Sound okay, until you turn on the ""subwoofer"". The Bass sound cheap. the product is all around built cheap. feel cheap. Nothing good about this headphone beside the fact that it looks good. I would not recommend this headphone to anyone."
4,Skull...crushers,"Just received my brand spankin new set of SkullCrushers today. I have real a lot of the other reviews and to my satisfaction, these headphones are worth the money. The vibrating bass is not a sub woofer, but then again you still might want to hear after you take these headphones off. Hooked up to my radio with 12 preset equalizer I have maximum performance. Please be careful when removing your new set of headphones from the package. And don't get frustrated, it took me 5 minutes just to figure out how to put em on my head without breaking them."
2,Should have listened to other reviews,"These sound very flat. The bass is good, but everything else just sounds flat. Many other reviews have stressed this, but I figured maybe they were just being picky. They were not. If you want to listen to anything other than bass heavy music, don't buy these. Also mine didn't come with the airplane adapter, unless they no longer ship with it."
3,It's alright,"Headphones aren't what they seem. They are loud, but don't actually have ""base"", and these don't keep the sound out like it says it does. I don't recommend it for the price..."
5,awesome headphones,i love these head phone awesome listing to them right now got them way before arival date that amzon gave me over all very good would buy again
3,decent heaphones,"I bought these headphones from bestbuy and theyre nice headphones. i love the bandana paisley look. the sound quality is decent. there is a bass feature that requires 1 AA battery, which will make it sound better. But a WARNING the battery dies very fast, and without the bass faeture the sound quality isnt as good as it is with it."
2,Bad construction quality,"ProsI bought this item last year, it has really good sound quality and the amplifier is great. Also the design looks cool.ConsHowever, the construction quality is poor and it broke, after a month, from the side while I was putting it on. Took it back but I really like the design and sound quality, so I thought may be the product I had was defective so I gave it another chance, I got the same kind again brand new. This one also broke and from both sides. It is pretty bad engineering or very low quality plastic or may be both. But I still paid good money for this and don't expect it to break so easily. I hope the manufacturer looks into this."
3,"Great Bass, Mediocre Mids & Highs","Based on the reviews on here, when I bought the Skullcrushers, I was hoping the sound would be phenomenal. Sadly, that's only half-true. The bass coming from the ""subwoofer"" speaker was very impressive and feels like you placed your head inside a sub box. On the other hand, the regular speaker that handles the rest of the sound is lackluster. The sound was crisp and clean and I heard details I've never heard before in the song, but it's very underpowered and non-responsive when compared to the sub. You can adjust the sub volume town so that the mids and highs are at the same level as the sub, but then you can barely hear the bass.If these were for $30-40, I'd say they were a decent (but not the best) purchase. But at a retail price of $70, they aren't worth it."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I was greatly disappointed with these stupid headphones. If you wanna throw away 70 bucks, then go ahead. Take off the battery, what do you get? 2 dollar headphones, I swear. I regret buying them. The bass is over exaggerated and doesn't sync in with the music."
1,These things suck,"I was super excited when the head phones got here, but they fold in half so it was constantly yanking out pieces of my hair , also when i leaned to the right at all the headphones sound went out. The bass amplifier hardly did anything, and the music was way quiet, i have earphones that are louder than those things."
1,I'm very disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this headset, I expected much more, because I bought another skullcandy brand products earlier and were of very good quality. The material of what it's made seems to be very cheap and fragile. The sound it's not great at all, is very opaque. the bass is nothing but vibration and the highs are missing, just mediocres mids.Recommend not to buy these headphones, go for the Titan Steel model of the same brand, there are way better and cheaper."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these things after reading allot of good reviews. but sadly these didn't meet up to my expectations.The bass is very lacking and the sound is pretty low quality. I am glad I bought them thought to get a personal experience of them, although they are stylish and fold nice that's pretty much all there is good to say bout these. So i returned them before the return policy ran out, and moved to another Brand. after trying a few models Skull candy makes, I decided they were not for me."
2,TRULY disappointed.,"I can't lie, I was truly disappointed. These headphones have really nice bass, but it seems that the actual speakers aren't very high-quality. They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned, but after two weeks of regular usage with high bass, the subwoofers on both sides started rattling. There wasn't anything else I could do but return them, and I still haven't received my voucher. The bass is incredible, the actual speakers (with bass turned off) doesn't have very high quality, they are very comfortable, but the durability is very low."
3,Disappointed,"Fit, looks, and comfort are great, but those are pretty much all of the good points. Sound quality is alright for a $40, but I expected much better. If the the sound amplifier is not on, there is no bass, and sounds like the speakers are busted. The other reviews about it not being loud enough are all correct. With my ipod and the amplifier all the way up, the headphones are still lacking about twice the loudness and bass.Maybe I just have too much expectations for these headphones since they are my first but compared to there in-ear ""ink'd,"" the ""ink'd""'s sound quality is much better; a lot louder and clearer; with the amplifier all the way up, the skullcrusher might have a bit more bass, but not much more; and they are much cheaper. I think the $40 are paying for the stylish look and the name, and not about the quality.Overall, I think for $40 and free shipping, they are worth-it, but if you are expecting major bass, don't get your hopes too high like me."
4,Decent for what you pay,"the sound quality it alright... just remember, these have a vibrating unit in them that creates the sensation of bass... if turned up to high, it just washes out the song."
3,They are ok,"Good sound while you have the subwoofer on, but awful when its off. Difficult to fold and put on, not good to wear around your neck."
2,Bad Quality,"The headphones sounded pretty good while they worked. The soud quality was not super awesome but having the subwoofers was pretty nice. They fit very well and were very comfortable which was also very nice. The problem I found is that, like other people, my speakers started to die after very little use. At this point only one speaker is working correctly and neither subwoofer functions anymore. I expected better given skullcandy's reputation but I was let down. If you buy these and they last, then more power to you, they aren't bad sounding but they seem to have a tendency to die."
3,good sound and bass but very fragile,"The skulllcrushers are great out of the box. The bass really is awesome. The problem is that they are not very durable. Doing physical activities while wearing these headphones affects the wiring of the headphones.Examples would be jumping hurdles(my case), running really fast,and juggling soccer ball. These would be recommended for listening on your spare time; not recommended if your on the go. The most sensitive and fragile part is where the sub woofer mechanism is on the cord. WARNING:NEVER WRAP CABLE AROUND MP3,IPOD,ZUNE,ETC. THIS WILL AFFECT THE LONGEVITY OF THE DEVICE!!!!!!!!!!"
5,best...headphones...ever!,"these things are amazing! i was expecting them to be better than normal, but i wasn't ready for these things! they are truly, ridiculously amazing. the bass actually shakes your head, quite literally...not only that, but it's not boomy or distorted...it's perfect...now then, you may be thinking, what about the other frequencies? they're covered...it's basically like having a 1000 dollar stereo on your head, it's insane!the cord is a teeny bit short, but it's the perfect length for using with your mp3 player while walking. i STRONGLY encourage the purchase of these...i've tried lots of headphones, and these are definitely the best, no contest. buy them!"
3,Monster Bass,"Well I gotta say I have had my fair share of head phones and these take the cake on acoustic and bass in regards to my music/movies/anime that I love watching.Couple of the downsides is the cord is so short about (2-3 feet roughly) If you don't have a speaker system console to hook them into(otherwise have your tower next to your monitor) it's gonna be a little rough on the neck. Aside from that you need a battery for the amplifier and you gotta remember to switch off the amp or when your done using them it'll eat your battery within a weeks time. I'm a simple person I like to plug and go but like my topic says the bass feed back is great and very crisp sound, worth a shot if you got the money. But aside from all that id say a 3 for versatility and use."
1,Jim M,"The worst headphones I ever have purchsed. Within a week, the headphones split along the head phone connecting right to left (just like the ones I listened to at BestBuy- thought it was customer abuse). Within three weeks the sub woofer on both sides went dead. The headphones are now in the garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
3,good headphones,"that amp on it actually works really well, the only thing is that it takes a battery to power it, like of sucks"
4,No complaints.,"I sent these to my son in Iraq because he's in the Army and he had requested them, it was the least I could do for him and he loved them when he received them."
2,CAUTION Listen to them before buying!,"I bought these from previous wonderful experience with Skullcandy's full metal jacket earbuds. I took a chance based on reviews that seemed to vary a great deal. I have to say after now owning them that I wish I would not have purchased them without listening first. I wanted to plug into my Kindle and relax with some ambiance but found that these headphones are definitely missing a pitch range. In case you missed that last line THESE HEADPHONES ARE DEFINITELY MISSING A PITCH RANGE. If you need to have audio frequencies well represented these are not the headphones for you. I am writing this to pay it forward to any future customer. Buyer beware, listen before you buy."
2,Great headphones while they last...,"I don't normally review products, but I have had these headphones for less than 6 months. They're truly amazing headphones. I love them to death. However, they randomly stopped working in one ear for no apparent reason. I'm pretty disappointed. I've had other Skullcandy headphones that have lasted years. I'm not sure if I'll chalk it up to a fluke and get another pair or not."
3,skull candy,"Good headphones for the price. It has a box on the wires that take a battery. I was not to thrilled with that, but it is long enough to clip to your pants so it is out of the way. Other than that they are comfortable and sound quality is good for the price."
3,Revised Review..,"After using these for a while, I've realized, do NOT waste your money on these. The huge problem with these headphones is that if you're a hip-hop/rap fan, and you have music with low bass, it sounds like absolute garbage. It's just poor sound quality overall, not to mention with the amplifier off, it sounds like garbage. Oh, not to mention you need a battery for the amplifier, and if you forget to turn it off, then it just drains like crazy.Go elsewhere"
5,skull candy snoop dog,1st set was delivered damaged and was quickly replaced but unfortunately I had to pay return shipping which I was not too happy about. The 2nd one arrived just fine and works great.
3,"ok, great bass","vary good sub wooferspoor workmanship, i recommend these to someone who can not pay the hundreds of dollars for good headphones.lots of breakable plastic thingsinside my headphones, after i droped them lightly on the flor the sub would start to shake inside the casing when turned to anylevel of high intensity."
3,There pretty good......i guess,"okay, the bass is non existant without the amp on. but wen its on, its pretty dope i guess...except wen u turn the dial all the way up the music just gets distorted.but the sound qualtity is pretty good and theyre SO COMFORTABLE.NOT WORTH 60-70 dollars though.....50? maybe.BTW the bass sounds artificial (like its being forced to vibrate instead of it going along with the song) [nota big problem though....]"
1,Skullcandy,"Do not buy this product. After two weeks, the clip that held the headset in place when unfolded, broke. It's not something that can be repaired."
5,Amazing headphones,"This is one of the best things I've ever purchased on Amazon. It works amazingly well, makes everything sound 10 times better & arrived in perfect timing."
4,good headphones that require good eq,These are good for the price. Just make sure to go to your eq settings an put the bass down. Yes down. These are amplified meaning you dont need to put ur eq bass setings up or the bass wil sound garbeled and horrible. these headphones actually sound GREAT when tuned corectly. Low bass high voice on eq an yr golden. :)
5,awesome,they sound amazing and the bass is really cool! they have a very nice look to them to! i wouldnt trade them for any other brand
2,Failure to produce good sound quality,"These headphones have great bass, but they do not contain the strong highs and mids to support it, turn the bass off and they sound like the $1 headphones you would get in an airplane. they also are made out of cheap plastic that breaks easy. after wearing these for 40 minutes of lawn mowing, they were very uncomfortable, and flimsy. you can get better headphones for $25 so save your money and buy something that is worth it. Skullcandy products = terrible cheap headphones"
4,"Great Headphones, Terrible color","These headphones are absolutely amazing and I've had them for over a year now, they're still working great. It has that battery pack that is kind of annoying down at the bottom of the cable that is needed for the bass to work, not a deal breaker. The color of blue is absolutely terrible though, if you're going to buy a pair i'd tell you to go with the black ones. Other than that i absolutely enjoy these headphones everyday."
3,a little small,"the headphones are small, i don't have a big head, but the deimentions for these were for small headed people. even the ear holders were a little to small. I'll admit my ears are generally bigger than normal, but these were just not big enough. The headset is also too ridged, the extenders are on the side and not on the top where they should be. Overall they work fine and the base option is pretty good, even though its hard to set it down. Don't get these for yourselves or someone you know closely. Its an alright gift for an aquaintance that needs headphones."
3,They are ok.,"I love the way bass makes them vibrate, but other than that they aren't anything special. If the batteries die they aren't even worth listening with."
2,Ehhh,"I was so pumped for these things because it promised so much bass, but instead of having any bass, it just vibrates to give the affect. Also the collapsible snap in the center broke the third day I got them which royally pissed me off"
3,Nice headphones.,"OK, but does not fit well on my head. Also was not clearly stated, that these were not amplifed. I wanted amplified, and wanted comfort.I did like the compact idea of the headphones."
4,Good for the price,"The Skullcandy headphone are a step above their earphones in terms of sound quality and comfort. The sound is crisp, bass is good (not great), and are very comfortable to wear. No issues with connection or breaking audio. Given the price of these headphones, they perform great. But they have no noise cancellation feature which makes them difficult to use on flights. But I guess adding NC would significantly jack up the price. So for this price, they perform well."
1,"Disappointing, huge let down","I've purchased skull candy headphones in the past, mainly ear buds. I've always liked the sound quality especially the bass. These headphones are by far the worse sounding headphones I've ever heard. Distorted bass all around. Bass boost makes it worse. I don't understand what all the possitive reviewers of this item are listening for but I do not & would never recommend this item to anyone"
2,its best sound out there but it built horrible,awesome sound and best bass out there. but its built horrible out of shity plastic i wouldn't get this again.
4,Good value for money,"Bought this for my teenage son and he loves it. According to him it looks cool and is a great hit with his friends.Reason for 4 stars, I found the overall audio quality average. My primary use is Sennheiser AdidasSennheiser Adidas PMX 680i Sports Headsetwhich is good for my treadmill and Bose QC3 for leisure."
5,Boomin' Bass,"These headphones rock, without a doubt. Listening to music, watching movies on my laptop... whatever. They block out sound extremely well, even when you're not playing anything through them. All Skullcandy headphones have a lifetime warranty. (At least if you get them from Skullcandy, but I'm sure these do too.) The bass on these is crazy awesome, the sound quality is great and they're super portable."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought these knowing they weren't Bose. I love over the ear headphones and I was hoping this would satisfy my needs. I read other reviews, already knowing the pro and cons of these headphones. What I wasn't expecting is the mono sound coming from the headphone without the bass turned on. It was a little disappointing, but common sense told me to just leave the subwoofers on. As far as watching movies with them, they are great. Appropriate for any movie you can imagine. I even used them to edit video and audio for school. What really disappoints me is they only lasted 25 days of use. The left subwoofer went out and I was left with crackling and poor sound. The sounds of the plastic as I moved around would overtake anything I was listening to at any point of having them on. Poor quality at a low price. I should have known better..."
5,skullcandy,"I got these headphones for my little brother and he absolutelt loved them, they are at a great price and they are a good quality :)"
2,"Good sound quality, but...","the token Skullcandy wire weakness shows here again. The cord is flimsy and cuts out. I thought it was just the set I had, but I returned them and received another set with the same thing in addition to chirping. Returning both and probably sticking with earbuds for now.The sound quality was awesome, although they were not great at blocking out jerks on the train. Subwoofer is a bit bulky and heavy, the weight might contribute to cord wear and tear. The speakers are soft and very comfortable (except they kept sliding off my hair), but not very loud."
4,Sure pack a punch,"These headphones are great and having got them on sale they were an even better deal for me. I was surprised at how comfortable they were -- at first. However, after wearing them for an hour or so they do get a little hot/uncomfortable over the ears. I expect this with anything over the ears though. And I always forget to turn the subwoofer controller off(causing the battery to die) when I am done using them so I usually don't bother with the subwoofer some days."
2,Bad Overall Sound Quality,"The overall sound quality is horrible in these headphones. There are basically two options when using these to listen to music: 1)Listen with no bass at all (sounds terrible), 2)Have so much bass that it overpowers everything else and vibrates like a cellphone on your ears (sounds terrible).There is a bass adjuster that in theory would be able to find a setting that you like, but it's more like letting you find a setting you hate the least. What the other reviews have said about the rock bass frequency range being non-existent is also true. I will not be using these headphones. I will just give it to someone I don't like as a twisted joke.The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the price. If it cost any more than it did I would be furious."
3,"Decent headphones, small, overpriced","The sound is decent, especially if you like bass. The reviews about the lack of mids are true. I am comparing against HD650s so its not really far though....Size: I have a larger head, these do not fit.I think 50(70 from their website) is a little bit of a rip for these. I think 40 or 30 would be better, the whole idea is to cover bad sound with bass.Again though my only other pair of cans are HD 650s, so I am biased."
2,Bit disappointed,Bought these for my 16yr old stepson and within three uses the left speaker is already not working..did go to website and fil out and send in hopefully they fix or send new ones quickly
4,Solid 'phones.,These are pretty good head phones. They sound fantastic with the bass setting on them. So much bass that when i listen to them for extended periodsi get a headache....yeah. I would recommend these if you want good quality for a cheap price.
3,missing battery cover,"The headphones are functional but the battery cover on the bass amplifier was missing.Beyond that, the headphones sound good but are a little clunky to handle. The bass can be a bit too much and can be hard to find a good balance."
2,DEFECTIVE,"When these arrived I was supper excited. They worked fine on my laptop and had great bass. Then I tried them on my phone... The bass turned sqeaky, almost like something was rattling around inside the speakers themselves. I thought, ok well it only say iphone and ipod comatible so maybe it was because I have an Android phone... Well... turns out it doesn't work on anything besides my laptop, and I waited too long to return them. But on the bright side, they make a great $50 decoration hanging on the wall in my room..."
2,skul candy,"well first off these skull candys require battery nd they diee very very quickly.. in like 5 hours. but the bass is pretty good. but without it, the headphones are useless...buy it, but also buy a battery charger."
1,WTF!!!!,Bought new headphones broke within a week wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! an i spent like 40$ an i have to return the an i sent them around a week ago an still no refund an they were great but a horrible but biggest waste of moneney in my life dont buy.
3,Crap,Don't buy these pieces of garbage. They will surely fall apart on you. Audio jack fell out just like that...
5,Scullcandy blue Headphone,"Great headphones, my daughter loves the way they block out all outside noise. Extremely comfortable. Would definitely buy again."
4,Not a bad but over all,"I mean its all about what you want. If you are into lots of base from generas such as Hip hop, electronica, Dubstep ect. its probably right for you. Sometimes Your ears get tired of the bass and u turn it off, then it sounds like some cheap old headphone. But the bass really does alot for it. I wore it for about 3 hours once my ears were hurting the rest of the day. but i mean if u have strong ears then go for it."
2,Bass noise amplified,"Turn on the bass and it's amplified bass noise, no mid-range. Turn off and it cuts out all of the bass and only has treble. No crisp clear sound. My earbuds work far better than this and are a lot cheaper. I was expecting amplified bass drum sound with a full mid-range, but it was hard to hear singing with the amplified bass noise. Kinda like listening to your neighbors stereo in your house where you only hear the bass but the music is muffled. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Its not all there!,My very first pair of skullcandys and I am disappointed. They are very loud but the bass is absolutely horrible. Without the subwoofer remote which uses an AA battery there is absolutely no bass. As a lover of heavy and punchy bass all I got was some ear vibrating noise. If you like loud headphones with no bass get these.
2,Save Your Money,"i was so hyped to order these because of the subwoofer attachment. when i got them i was happy, but when i plugged them in and turned on the subwoofer, i was really dissapointed. the subwoofer lets you hear all the base sounds but the speakers themselves have almost no bump to them. even my grandma used them and her 20 dollar pair of koss has better bass in them. definitley not worth the money if you want hard hitting bass."
1,"Terrible sound, Amp is overhyped and fake.","I thought these were going to be the best heaphones,I wanted them to buy the greatest, I was dissapointed and was contempt with them. For a while until I realised they were garage and I sold themWithout the ""bass"" they are [...] and uselessI parenthesize that word since you are not getting genuine bass. Bass should not be powered by batteries, the subwoofer is just a fake label.You really get loud vibrations picked up by drivers, hence why you need batteries. You get a ringing sensation, it will itch the first time.I think skullcandy should sell vibrators not headphones.Overall they are relaxing for a while but you realize the sound quality does not keep up with the bass.I reccomend these 70 dollars be spent elsewhere, try them out for yourself before you buy them I know tons of kids who love them, thus why I sold them.Worth 20 dollars If you ever wanna buy these, either way there's no reason, Sony has xb500's if you want genuine bass."
2,Good for play not for pros,"As a working DJ i play 3 or 4 nights a week. Recently my pioneer hdj-500's broke and i was looking for a sutible replacement. The bass in these is no good. It sounds super hollow. If you are a working DJ, these will not do, If you are out snowboarding with your friends, they might work, but still, they don't sound very good. Over all, Get something else."
2,Not real quality,"This headphones are not what I wait, I thought that it is a good product but when I listened a bad quality, the subwoofer is not good enough... the simple headphones from the apple area top quality more than this product... is got a good design, but this product is just appearance, I should bought the BEATS instead of this..."
4,"Gimme Bass, gimme sound !!","This was the most highly anticipated product I bought and knew it would be awesome from just the name SKULLCANDY. However, this seems like a smaller size than I have used in the past from other brands like Sony. I mean it is of the exact size of my head and fits tight. This is irritating when you get to the 5th, 6th track. Also the sub woofer clamp is useless, it barely hangs onto anything.So I'd suggest to get this only if it fits right. The sound quality is very good and so is the bass."
5,Skullcrushers crush and BEAT Dr. Dre's Beats Headphones,I first tested the skullcrushers at BestBuy and compared them to the more expensive Beats by Dre and another pair of Sony headphones in the $200 range. I love bass and these headphones far surpassed the capacity to produce bass. If you're looking for great sound quality and super bass these are the best headphones out there.
3,ok not what i expected but it is ok with eq settings,the bass is very loud but you should expect that but everything else is very low you have to adjust the eq to make the other sounds louder
5,Awesome Skull Crushers,These are easily the very best headphones I have ever encountered. I love listening to music with them. It is like being in the front row at a concert. They are that real.
4,good for the price,"good for the price,you could break these headphones if your a moron! Be careful they swivel and thats how these could be broke,just be smarter than the headphones!!!"
4,"Great sound, not so sturdy","O bought these not too long ago and I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed them, FOR THE TIME THEY LASTED ME. I was using them for about four months and I had a hell of a time while using them. I usually had them blasting and transported me to musical worlds. One of the pros I would mark for this product is the volume switch which allows you to temper with the volume, just to give you that extra boost. The headphone padding is very comfortable and fits nicely over your head. The design is cool, if you are into that sort of thing. Many people talk about how fashionable this item is and I can attest to that. But besides that, it performs very well. You look good and more importantly it WORKS well. Again the reason why I can not give it a perfect score is because they ended up breaking down on me little by little until ultimately it snapped in half. I think I would go for another pair but I would wait a while to see if they update their builds."
2,For Kids,"These headphones are a gimmick, they are not for people looking for a quality set of headphones. Within 3 months the batteries exploded within 4 months the headset started to rattle and sound nasty. These are not for people who enjoy quality music. They sound weak, the bass doesn't exist the only 'bass' like feature is a vibrating wheel inside the headset...complete garbage"
2,Disappointed,the ear buds has more bass than those. i was sooooo excited to receive these and was very disappointed. i will recommend you buy the earbuds or maybe beats by dre.
3,Okay headphones...,"These headphones have 2 subwoofers in them that give them a lot!! of bass. And, thats it because the rest of the music sounds bad haha. If you love bass get these, if you love sound quality don't."
3,Seemed pretty cheap to me,"I bought these and didn't like them, so I sold them. They seemed really cheap. They looked cool. I'm not sure how their sound quality is, but the way they felt was real flimsy and cheap."
1,They broke,"I want to give Skullcandy a last chance, yet they disappointed me again, they clip broke and there is no reapir, they are not practical at all, and its a very cheap plastic."
1,Requires battery for subpar bass,"Don't forget to turn off the battery operated subwoofer, otherwise you'll lose it over night.... unless you find another AA to power up a mediocre sounding bass supplement that doesn't exist without the battery. Zero bass without the battery.... zero stars. Well, you get one star, because there's no zero option."
1,WTF,"Bought these, got them two days later, bass sounded cool up until 40 minutes later when I set them down and later used them to find the subwoofer blew out. honestly NOT EVEN AN HOUR OF USING THEM THE BASS BLOWS OUT. WTFFFFF"
3,Fun for a few days,"They were fun for a few days. I got tired of them and handed them down to a younger sibling, he really like 'em"
5,Quallity and Design Winner,"My son received these headphones for Christmas and was thrilled with the black pinstripe design and the sound quality seemed comparable to his sister's excruciatingly more expesive Studio Beats......Shipping was fast and the product arrived looking like I took it right off of the self. I cant comment on durabilty at this point, but the immediate vote is a thubms up!"
5,Price,"I just ordered these headphones. I'm very excited for them but I have to ask,why are they $10 cheaper than they were when I bought them just a few days ago?"
3,Good sound - NOT suitable for an iPod,"I've been looking for a good set of over-the-ear headphones to listen while at work. I like to crank my music every now and then and not have to worry about bothering my co-workers around me. Received these for Christmas after listening to them in an Apple store. Thought they sounded awesome in the store. However, when I hooked them up to my iPod (iPod Nano, 5th Gen), I was sorely disappointed. The sound was very clear but it was also very low. My iPod just wasn't powerful enough to drive them with any authority. The added battery powered Bass booster just made them more ""thumpy"" without helping the rest of the music range. I returned these to Amazon for a refund.Bottom Line: If you have a good home system or computer for your iTunes these would probably work fine, but they are not a good match for an iPod."
2,one problem,"these were a great portable pair of headphones for a while, then all of a sudden the right ear stopped giving sound. i could here the bass in the ear, but no mids or highs. i can only suspect that it was because of the wiring in the bass amplifier battery compartment. they lasted me a good 7 months or so."
4,Great,These are great looking as well as great sounding headphones. The only reason its not a five star is because you need to have a double A battery for the bass. It's not a very big hassle. It lasts about a week. Overall very good headphones.
4,worth it,"These headphones are pretty good. the sound quality is pretty good and i like that you can adjust the power of the subwoofer for each song. The durability seems like it might be kinda shotty but so far no problems after a month or so. the head band is pretty thin and small, its kinda hard to wear around your neck. value wise these things are really great. unless you want to spend tons of money these would probably be the best bet quality wise and theyre also the first headphones ive seen with subwoofers"
4,You want these for the price.,"These are great headphones, you may be wondering why I would rate it only 4 stars, the truth is that besides the fact that they are a lil uncomfortable to carry around especially cause of the sub control that is attached to the headphone cord, you constantly have to play with built in sub-woofer control, not a big problem though, they sound great with every genre of music, I listen to lil bit of everything to include variety in latin music and they sound great with all of them, but like I said you have to sometimes adjust to the differences in sounds of music,the same goes as far as watching movies or videos. Other then that I am really pleased with them, they sound great and would recommend them to anyone especially for the price, you can't expect much for headphones that cost 30$ but these headphones really impressed."
2,governed loudness ?,"overall these seemed ok,I returned them. you get what you pay for.the volume level was the biggest problem,it was like it had a governor and restricted the sound(yes the bass module was on and working). I tried them in my computer and ipod,no change. These produced about 1/2 the volume? The bass module was an ok thing but I did not care for it.Heavy on the cord and it did nothing for the volume it just thumps and vibrates your ears more.Instead of sending them back for replacement I bought the Hesh model w/no gimmicks on them. Ah ha, an ok headphone for the price."
4,Skullcandy SCS-SCBP3.5 Skullcrushers Subwoofer Stereo Headphones,"Very nice headphones for the money. only reason they did not get five stars across the board is that the bass distorts a little too quickly when using the sub-woofer feature. Other than that, they are awesome. They do not get too hot on the ear and are very comfortable."
1,BAD IDEA!!,I thought these headphones had an ok sound to them and the bass was good until it went defective after four days of use... i see a lot of reviews with their items being broken or defective and these headphones just cannot be trusted is my view on it... When i turned the bass on there would be a very crappy beeping or scratching noise on bass parts when they went defective!! it sucked and ruined all of the songs... Wont make this mistake again..
1,Falling apart after six months,"Had a pair of these just over six months. Don't use the subwoofer, but unlike others I have no problem with the sound on mine ... kinda distorted at first, but whether they broke in well or I just got used to it, they sound great now. But the plastic along the adjustable headband started chipping away and now one of the earpieces slips off and stabs my left ear every couple of days. Awesome.I realize that at $36 these are not intended to be top of the line, but if I have to tape this thing together after just six months of moderate use, that's a pretty crappy design. I'm not looking to spend $36 every six months on headphones, so don't think I'll be buying anything else from Skull Candy."
5,Great headphones,It arrived on time and was brand new minus the box. I recommend this vendor. The only thing I don't like is that they don't get as loud as I would like.
5,"Good sound quality, powerful bass","Without the subwoofer on, there isn't really any bass, but the quality is crystal clear. When it is on, the bass is very powerful but doesn't really drown out the rest of the music. Definitely not for audiophiles, but no headphones for this price will be. They also fold up nicely for easy carrying. I'm very happy with them and would recommend it for someone who doesn't always want tons of bass, but can get plenty by turning on the subwoofer."
2,Broke quickly,"These headphones sounded good when I first got them, but within a week the connector jack to the headphones broke and the sound quality disappeared. I will admit that skull candy honored their warranty and replaced them for me."
2,Disappointing,"Obviously the ""subwoofer"" is a tiny little vibrating element in the phones. And the result of that is it feels and sounds like you're wearing vibrating headphones. It doesn't sound like bass at all, it sounds like noise. And it feels weird. They are very comfortable and block out a lot of ambient noise. But even at the $35 I paid for them, I could have gotten better for the money."
2,Skullcandy Warrenty,"The headphones sounded great for the short while I had them, the little metal part you stick into your iPod broke off about a week after I received them and when I sent them off to Skullcrusher to get fixed they took them and I never heard from them again, so if you need a good pair of headphones, pick them up, however if they break don't waste your money on sending them in."
1,CHEAP,"Skull Candy is all about looks, even then it doesn't look good. Sound isn't good. Mini subwoofer is cool but your going to go deaf, and you NEED a battery or else it will sound super flat. The bass controller is freaking annoying to have hanging around all the time. This isnt a headphone that you would want to carry around. Quality of product is super cheap flimsy plastic. Headphone jack broke and i had to re solder with a new jack. (THAT sucked!) Never will buy from SkullCandy. Go with a real brand like SennHeiser."
1,Very bad sound quality. Too much bass.,"ProsComfortablevery good built qualitylong battery lifeConsBad sound quality-I read a review that says this can compete with a 150$ sennheiser headphone, are you people kidding me?!! Even a sennheiser cx 300 that cost 30$ sounds 20 times better than this. This headphone produces very loud, muddy, and grainy bass that overlaps the mids and highs. The mids sounds hollow, and the highs are muffled, opaque, that distort at high frequencies (14-20khz) they also have a very narrow soundstage that sounds very grungy."
2,disappointing,"i was so excited when i got the package today but when i opened it i found myself very disappointing. the actual headphone has a different color than the picture, its more of a dark blue instead light blue shown on the picture. the quality suck balls! cheap plastic that i'm sure it will break with in months."
2,Not even close.,"I'm picky about my audio. Not so much that I'll get into an argument about whether burn-in has any effect or not, but the sound has to be clean and balanced or I'm not happy. The skullcandy skullcrushers is nowhere near this.I am aware that these headphones are meant for bass, and in that it delivers. When you turn the battery-powered sub on you get a noticeable boost in the low, but the problem is that while they were working on the bass, they forgot the make the rest of the range any good. The mid and high are nowhere near the same levels and there is a laughably noticeable fall off in volume when the tone goes above the sub's inadequate range.I will say this, it seems well-balanced for rap. So if you plan on listening to nothing but rap on your new skullcrushers, you will be happy the rest of your days. Everyone else will be severely disappointed."
2,Good sound quality but BREAKS EASILY,"The quality was good, sound was great I loved it. Had it for three months, my cat knocked it off of a desk and it broke. The plastic on the sides break VERY EASILY (the part that attatches the headset top to the actual earphones, it allows the earphones to fold within itself.)Was still able to use it after duck-taping it back together until the other side snapped after the cord got stuck on a cabinet and it fell (Im only five two mind you), then the two sides completely shattered two months later. Dont get me wrong, the sound quality was amazing and the bass kicker was great but it isn't worth the 40 dollars I paid at the time, I'm glad its on-sale because the plastic they use is crappy.Caution: I know a lot of people who have bought these headphones and had them break in the SAME PLACE."
4,fun bass,"it could have shipped faster than did but wasn't horrible but they are a really fun pair of headphones if you turn the bass up they kick pretty hard and they are very comfortable and a have a good sized cranium. i am very pleased with them, but like the other reviews they don't have top of the line sound overall a good product."
3,Honestly,"These headphones are alright. They aren't that special. I wouldn't recommend them. They only sound well with the bass, otherwise, they are mediocre"
2,Ton of bass...the bad kind of bass,"I was looking for headphones that would give me a deep, low, bass so I bought these Skullcrushers. They look great but I was not impressed by the sound.First of all, yeah there's a ton of bass, but the tonality and texture is so thin it defeats the purpose of turning up the bass. I think they are rightfully named ""Skullcrusher"" because the vibration this thing puts on your ears is unbearable when bass is turned up highest, and just plain annoying when you turn the knob down a bit.I'm not an old guy complaining about how loud the bass is.I'm actually 25 years old who loves music and sound. The quality is just very cheap. The highs sound like a tin can, while the bass sounds like a nasty farting noise constantly thudding in your ears.I feel like their ""selling point"" is the whole subwoofer idea. Sounds great on paper, but no so much in the ears."
3,Ok Headphones,When i bought these they were great but after a while i just got tired of them. First off the sound is good but the bass aint really bass its just the headphones shaking and i thought buying batteries for it was pretty lame. I did like them at one point but after a while i just gave them to my little cousin and got myself some Sony MDR-XB700 now those puppies have bass.
3,"Almost but,","I buy these for my son to use at home. The bass is great but they are usually broken within two months. At $50.00 a pop, these are probably the most expensive disposable headpphones on the market. It would be worth the extra cost for better connections and quality control."
1,Broken when bought.,"When I bought these skull candies the connection between the headphones, was already broke. Mainly cause its made with cheap plastic. So I called the company that it was bought from through amazon, and they said it was broke during shipment, haha yeah right, you can tell it definitally wasn't. So anyways, they said they will send me an email ASAP with a shipping label to put on it that I would have to drop off at a FedEx location. Problem: weeks after phone conversation, email never received. Also: I live in the ""middle of nowhere"" and god knows where the nearest FedEx location is. So now I have a pair of broken cheaply made product, that some company who I forgot is called and don't know their number purposely sold me, that I paid $50 for. I love amazon, but am ashamed at this transaction."
3,skullcrushers,"There's nothing really wrong with these, I just set my expectations a bit too high.They are quite comfortable, isolate sound well and the bass boost does work. The bass is just not very nice. They make all bass sound exactly the same, around 75 hz. If all you want is volume, these are great, but if you actually want good, clear, detailed bass look somewhere else."
5,She loves them!,"I bought this as a gift for someone who used her friends, and she kept bragging about how good they were, she got them in the mail and said, ""I feel like they sound better than hers"", :D"
1,Waste if money..,"The only thing I liked about these headphones is the sub-bass the drivers produced. Problem is, there is no real sound-stage these headphones produced. I know they were inexpensive, but I had a pair of Sennheisers that cost half as much and produced a way better overall sound reproduction than these. So, if you want these to play rap or other sub-atomic music these will suit your needs. But if classical or jazz music is your genre don't bother with these. Also, if you have a big head these will not comfortably fit ear to ear."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME,"Easy to carry, amazing quality, doesn't drain the battery (unless the subwoofer is left on) and amazingly cheap?! I don't think I could be impressed anymore... And I saved two dollars by buying from this seller. If you want a great headset with awesome sound without emptying your wallet... These are the ones you want!"
2,SOUND IS TERRIBLE,"THESE SKULLCANDY HEADPHONES ARE JUST for looks, they look cool but the sound is awful. if sound is more important to you than looks then buy something else. anyone who has good quality headphones knows these are for someone's first set of cans, after you get something else you can never go back to these toys. seriously, when others see you with these they laugh at you cause they know you dont know what good sound is. for the way skullcrushers sound they should only cost about 15 dollarsFOR A BETTER CHOICE TRY THESE: KICKER HP541, these are everything you want, sturdy abs strong plastic, very soft earcups, and the sound is very good especially the bass without being fake sounding, i give the kickers 4.5 of 5SOL REPUBLIC V12: these are also great sounding headphones, feel comfy, and sound awesome, especially for deep bass and dubstep or electronic music, very good bass"
4,"Comfortable, but feels cheap","I've always wanted a pair of skullcrushers, so I figured that I should buy a pair before they stop making them. They feel comfortable and come with a storage bag (which is nice). However, I feel like I might break them when I collapse them. The whole thing is made from plastic, so while it's light it also feels flimsy. The built in subwoofer is interesting and I like it, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price and I certainly could have done without it."
4,I got what I expected,"I got these more for stylish purpose than practical. They're made of a cheap feeling plastic, but they seem to be pretty durable, I've had them about 6 months now.They are pretty quiet even for 30mm drivers, but the subs are what really sell it. It provides a distinct and practical purpose for over ear headphones out and about. The subs are battery poweredand will last on a single double A battery for about a month with 3-4 hours use a day, provided you turn them off when not in use, if you leave them on all the time, they'll last a few days.They rest well around the neck when idle, but after they're broken in the ear covers are a lot more loose. Not an issue when you're wearing them, but around the neck they canend up awkwardly positioned. If you want a quality set of headphones, I'd take a pass. But if you want something that stands out. These are a pretty solid buy."
3,Good bass but easily got damaged,"The Quailty of the audio With and Without the bass turned ON is DJ quality.Pros:Good BassBass Volume adjustmentWorks as a sorroundCons:The bass may get broken with some time of use.Bottomline:the cables are weak, and be sure to replace the battery of the bass anytime you can.Exist more quality for the same price!"
5,Best headphones money can buy with a cord.,Love these headphones. Love the bass boost feature. Earpads are very soft and not cumbersome. I recommend these headphones to anyone whose looking for a very nice pair of moderately priced headphones.
2,"Good sound, when they work.","Only one side of the headphones works. the only way I get the other side to wrok is by bending on the headphone plug in the right direction. I've only had the headphones for a few weeks and have had this issue since day one. THey're confortable and fit nicely, tho."
4,Great for What They Do,"A decent pair of headphones with good bass response, the Skullcrushers sport adjustable bass, comfort, and portability through the folding feature. I only listen to metal music, which thumps with bass more so than any other headphone I've tried. The bass feels watered down through vibrations, but the vibrate feature makes feeling your music more fun than simply listening to it. These cans isolate almost as much noise than a decent pair of in-ear headphones and can isolate the noise of a car tremendously.My complaint is with the price. $80 is too much when the HD 280 is only $20 more. The headaches these give after listening are brutal, like your head is filled with pressure, even if listening at low volumes. All in all, these are a spiffy pair of headphones and despite the $70-$80 price tag, are worth a look."
3,"Good sound, but overall not amazing headphones.","I believe that the sound quality for these headphones was good, except the added base feature was over the top. People could hear the headphones clearly when I had the volume up. The sides stick out at an awkward angle, making them look funny on my head so I decided to return them."
1,Broken in a month's use,I gifted these to my son for Christmas. The wires have come loose at the connections almost a month after purchase. I would not suggest this product to my friends.
2,I would like to return this product,I meant to order a different model. May I return this? Please give me instructions how I may return it
1,Yep,"I purchased these about a year or so ago and unfortunately I was extremely underwhelmed. I could easily chalk these up as my worst set of earphones. I recently purchased a set of Beats Wireless and I couldn't be happier. Yeah having a tune-able subwoofer is a good concept, but, it just doesn't work out. I understand Beats Wireless and these are an apples to oranges compare-o, but this things were a huge disappointment. Oh well. They went to the garbage can."
1,Not that great,"I bought these at Best Buy for $75, and I can't believe how atrocious they sound. No bass. The vibrating sub-woofer is not a suitable replacement for real bass. You would expect something more from headphones that claim a sub-woofer. I would put these on par with $15 ear buds or mid-range ear-cup headphones."
3,not awesome...,it is designed to vibrate more that the actual sound....people if you are looking for sound quality this is not it.....dont get me wrong it sounds good but not as expected.
3,nice headphones but not the best i've heard.,"these skullcandy skullcrushers are nice in a scale of 0 to 10 i give it a 7 only because you have to have the subwoofer on in order to hear any kind of bass. i had some panasonic virtual motion sound sytem ""VMSS"" headphones that broke after 3 years of use and these headphones were the best i've ever had. the model number for the panasonic headphones is: Panasonic RP HT970 Brain Shaker Heaphones they are the same size as the skullcandy head phones. unfortunetly they were discontinued so i bought these head phones hoping for the same performance but for the price they sound good but not great. just remember you cant hear any bass on these headphones if you dont have the power on. you do feel the headphone vibrate ok but they dont feel as strong as the panasonic head phones."
2,"Mostly silly, but it has its moments","I've only just started reading the book so I don't get all the lyrics, if they're related to the book.The music is very uneven. There are one or two somewhat catchy songs with good musical arrangements, for example the first two songs. Some of the songs are just plain bad, like ""Bang-Bang"" and ""Just A Kid"". ""Joy City"" is somewhat catchy and the lyrics are so awful it's funny. It's also hilarious that it sounds like they're playing table tennis. The whole song is so silly it's funny.Most of the album works on a ""campy"" level because it's so over-the-top and silly, or just to listen to as background music, but it's not ""good"". Buy it only if you find it at a cheap price."
1,What?,"Watch out - if you like to ""come out at night"", best stay away from this ""mission"". This sounds like some of the earlier pop Prince projects- but they are better. I picked up the cassette of this album for a quarter - and still question if I got my moneys worth! While Edgar has always had a more commercial lean than brother Johnny, he still has my respect as a school of rock professor. You can find a decent sax solo or two on this recording, maybe. But overall, this is a concept project album, and contributes little musically to the Winter cataloge."
4,Good product,This is a good product. If used while running it tends to slip down on the head over time.
1,Not as good as I thought it would be,"The light was great for close work or reading, but the batteries don't last very long in it perhaps because of the low battery indicator and the plastic cracked somehow.If it was made out of stainless steel, extremely tough aluminum, carbon fiber or titanium and it didn't have a low battery indicator that wastes your batteries while letting you know that your batteries are getting low, it would be great. But unless these changes are made to it, I would not recommend it."
1,Doesn't work..........,"Sadly, this doesn't work. So disappointing. Sending it back. I think the soft button design to turn it on is a bad design."
3,Princeton Tec Quad headlamp,"Works great, built well, shines bright BUT battery life is not so long. Lost it somewhere already. Kinda expensive so won't buy again."
1,Switch Failed,The switch failed after just a few uses. The light refuses to stay on. The headlamp was not abused in any way.
4,Good Buy,"I haven't found the perfect light yet, but this one is great. I still give it five for good design and great price when found on sale as it usually is.I like the fit and overall comfort as much as is possible wearing a headlight. The weight is impressively light overall and makes it a great backpacking companion. The battery life is good and the constant output technology works decently on high but it does still dim some and the other settings basically become the same as the batteries reach their third or quarter power mark. I love that most Princeton Tec lights are also waterproof as this takes the fear out of occasional dunk or rainstorm.I can't say I have used this for running but I have not had issues with the hinge and I have owned it for four years. My wife usually takes it though and I use the Petzl Myo.Overall a great buy and I recommend it without qualms. My main gripe would be the color spectrum being on the blue side, but maybe PT has improved that in recent years."
1,Poor Quality Pivot Point,"Echoing what another reviewer said, the pivot point is made out of plastic. Due to this fact, the lamp loses its ability to grip onto the pivot point as the plastic wears down. Mine is at the point -- after four or five times out running -- where it has to be either completely up and facing forward or it will flop down and point directly at my feet. Neither of these positions is useful for running as a straight forward position puts the light too far for running, and straight down simply blinds me and doesn't shoot the light far enough forward. I would expect this problem to exist for other applications as well if you have to lean forward. Do not buy this product.I now have to put a piece of plastic behind the lamp and use a rubber band to hold the lamp against the plastic. This allows it to point down slightly, but it looks even more ridiculous. Definitely not worth the money."
3,Great Headlamp but wont stay in position,"I bought what I believed was the identical headlamp from L.L. Bean a couple years ago; quad LED, 3 brightness levels plus blinking, 3 AAA batteries, identical design, made by Princeton Tech. I loved it and wondered how I had ever gotten along without one. Also wondered why I would ever need a regular hand-held flashlight again. When I lost it I bought this Princeton Tech model from Amazon. Identical in all respects, EXCEPT ...There is something wrong with the mechanical mechanism that allows you to tilt the lamp down to your desired angle. After just a couple months it seems to have worn out and it won't hold in position. It just flops down. Only thing I can do is wear it upside-down and be satisfied with the light straight ahead. Evidently poor quality on the tilting mechanism.THEN, I found my old one from L.L. Bean. While, as I said, it looks identical in all respects, its tilt adjustment continues to work fine.Very disappointing."
4,Good work-light,"I have used it to do some work in my attic. it provided good hands-free illumination and was comfortable enough. I wouldn't want to wear it for more than an hour; especially while sweating, but it did the job just fine. Seems like plenty of light for most things. It also has lower settings, probably for reading or just not blinding your friends... but I have not needed them yet. I don't own any other headlamps so I can't say how it compares. Compared to a regular flashlight it wins on all counts."
4,Great headlamp,"The Princeton-Tec Quad headlamp is one of the best headlamps Priceton-Tec engineered. Its 4 modes are high, medium, low, and flash. It's about 45 lumens, not to mention the product description about the headlamp can withstand submerging underwater 1 meter deep. I've been happy with it. It's great to use outdoors in the pitch black night. The high, medium, and low beams might affect battery life and distance. But I haven't used it long enough to find out."
3,Great except the ridiculous pirating 'commercial'.,"We love this video. My son loved it since he was 3 months (now 8) except the part with the letters - for some reason that bores him. There are options to change the language to English which is great for my bilingual son.There is one big problem though: there is an anti-pirating 'commercial' at the beginning of the DVD, and you can't bypass it as it's before the DVD menu comes up. It's TERRIBLE. The message is: if you pirate videos you're a terrible person and you look like a pirate to your kids. It says the videos look bad but you look worse as a parent. My problem with this is that it's on a baby's dvd! It's very rude and shouldn't be something that babies are watching. I would bet it's not on the regular English 'Right Hemisphere' version as the written words are in Spanish and the rest of the DVD the written words are all in English.The video would be 5 stars were it not for the ridiculous 'commercial'."
2,Good Live Footage but Not Much Insight into the Band...,"Ramones Raw is basically Marky Ramone with a handheld camera annoying Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and C.J. while on tour. There is some great live footage of the band playing some classic songs. The DVD doesn't really tell a story but is more of a narrative of the Ramones life on the road. The inner relations of the band are not touched upon at all. In fact, by watching Ramones Raw you'd never know that Johnny and Joey hated each other with a passion. Most of the running time is lighthearted gags and inside jokes interspersed with concert footage. For a complete look at the inner workings of the band, as well as the making of most of their albums, pick up the End of the Century DVD it is a MUCH more comprehensive look at the band as a whole. Recommended for Ramones Diehards and completists only."
3,hey ho lets watch the home movies,very good look at the ramones last few years ////plus lots of classic ...live performances...a must have for all punk fans ....loved it
5,enjoyable,"I am reading through the Russians series. I enjoyed the first book and was dying to begin the second. The story line is interesting and the characters have depth. But what I enjoy the most is the accurate history woven throughout the story. You feel as if you are in Russia during the 1800's. I also value the Christian undertones. I have read other Christian fiction and many of the works come off as preachy, including lenthy sermons and life lessons. This book weaves religion into the story and gives you an appreciation for the characters and their strength and faith during the difficult time period."
5,Pella and Phillips continue to please!,"Book two of the Russians series has action, romance, friendship and best of all, an interesting storyline.This series is typically categorized by bookstores as ""religious fiction"". I will say that there is an underlying message about God (after all religion plays a huge part of Russian history) but it was simply woven into the story subtly and relevantly. I have read other Pella books and found this to be the case with them as well.This book was the start of my infatuation with historical fiction and I am thankful for it. I do recommend all seven in the series with five stars - read them, although it may take a while!"
2,Not the right book,"Although the presentation of the book was well done, if you are looking for inspiration on building an actual portfolio this is not the book. It is a series of case studies that don't actually show you want the end result of each design firms portfolio looked like. It only presents what went into the portfolio.If you want to see a bunch a firms' work or if you are looking for best in practices you can pick up a magazine like HOW for about 2 bucks.If you are trying to get inspiration on actually building your portfolio and want to learn more about how the end result should look, try another book."
2,Wish it was Sweatproof,"I love the scent, and it works, but it you are going to be in humidity, or you are plannning on getting sweaty, don't bother. It comes right off.I have used on my kids while playing in the yard and you just have to keep reapplying, which is kind of a pain.I also used this on a trip to Jamaica, and I still got bit up.Wish it worked better."
4,STINKS!,Works great but man oh man does it stink...that's probably why it works lol. I wish it would spread when you spray it on your child. It just shoots on them leaving you to rub it in and you don't want that smell on your hands all day. I can't express how much it stinks but I use to put it on a lot of kids while I was working at a daycare and I dreaded putting it on. One good tip is to use a paper towel when you spread it on but that stuff keeps the bugs away that's for sure.
1,Attracts bees!!,"This product not only has a terrible smell, but it attracts bees! I put it on myself and my two small children and, each time we went outside, bees flocked to us. Needless to say, my kids were scared and wanted to go back inside. I'm throwing this stuff out!"
1,Horrible,"This stuff was worthless, we covered our daughter (Seriously COVERED) for 4th of july fireworks. Firewors where about 45 minutes long. She has so many bites we are taking her to the doctor tomorrow because here eyes and ankles have swollen."
1,A little bugged about this product,"I ordered this for my son who is attacked by mosquitoes every day.....but this product didn't help! I tested one day by not applying his usual bug spray..what a mistake! He still got 9 bug bites that night after only being outside for a hour! I wish I could send it back for a refund! By Avon's unblock and bug repellent in one!!!! So much better, and it smells great too!"
3,Works but it's stinky.,"As far as repelling bugs, it was the best non-DEET formula I've tried. One downside: It's pretty smelly. I have to double ziplock it to keep everything else in my bag from smelling like it. The scent dissipates a few minutes after applying it to yourself/clothes though."
2,Overrated...,"Sorry, I don't get it. Sure, there are some nice enough songs on there, but they're few and far between. Mostly what we get is tired old recycled riffs which sounded a lot better when The Kinks (or whoever) did them to begin with. I got interested in checking Twilley out on the basis of stuff like ""I'm On Fire"" and ""Out Of My Hands"", and because I had heard so often how underappreciated and excellent he was supposed to be, and everyone pointed me in the direction of this one. Nonesense! You're perfectly well enough off with just the ""XXI"" ('Best Of') CD, and even that one's not in short supply of a filler. In short: If you're really looking for good music in this vein which isn't on everyone's menu, just check out Duncan Faure, Fountains Of Wayne, or someone who's really, truly, underappreciated...there's no shortage of 'em out there. Happy hunting!"
5,The very best Chanel fragrance!,"Allure is the best of the Chanel line, topping the sensuality of Chanel #5 and the sweet floral fragrance of Chanel #22. The spicy scent lingers all day long without being overpowering. If you like Chanel #5 and #22, you'll love Allure. It's my favorite because you get the best of both all in one - the spiciness and the sweetness."
1,Amazon sent wrong product,Product is great. Unfortunately it is not the product ordered and paid for. I wouldn't recommend using Amazon in the future for similar online purchases.
3,It is effective,"Sticky Paws was effective in keeping my cat from scratching on spots where I put it. I use it on the top of some speakers and on my sofas. I have red leather furniture so it is somewhat noticeable and not very pretty but at least it keeps him from tearing into the leather. I have had it for a couple weeks and it seems to be safe with the leather, which was one of my initial concerns."
2,Probabily depends on the cat?,"My cat keeps scratching the carpet under the door, and since I'm afraid she will ruin the carpet and it wakes me up throughout the night, I put a twin draft guard there and stuck some of this stuff onto it to keep her from ruining the carpet and waking me up scratching at the twin draft guard. It worked for 8 days, but then she started doing the clawing again with the sticky stuff there. I even tried putting another layer of strips down, thinking that maby the week-old ones weren't so sticky anymore, but she just kept on scratching."
5,What a wonderful book,"Most poetry these days doesn't usually speak to me, but I found myself strongly attracted to the poems in this book. The first half, titled ""Names & Faces"", gives a fascinating look at the people who inhabit Coke's world, his friends, his family, and people he just happened to run into. The second section, ""Gray Matters"", while not as strong as the first half, had more to say that directly related to my world, including such gems as ""For a Minute in Late March I Was Free"", and give me insight into worlds I may never have considered or knew existed. I recommend this book very much."
2,"This book has nothing about sea kayaking, lakes or riffles.","I purchased this book based on the promise of itstitle, a promise not kept. The book is almostwholly about white-water kayaking, ignoring mymain interest, lakes, ocean, lagoons, and simplerivers without complicated white-water rapids.The book title includes the word ""complete""and the book is far from that. It also limitsitself mostly to one-man kayaks, little helpfulabout how to select a kayak to buy.-Jon Claerbout"
4,Princess Leia,"Doll looks like the Princess Leia in the Star Wars Show.Package cam dusty, but doll was fine.Our Grandaughter said she was beautiful."
1,Quality,"I am very unhappy with this product I ordered ,the package appeared to have been stored in a molded warehouse or something of that sort.I did not appreciate the reglious paper in the package also.This was a present for my grandaughter but I will NOT be giving this to her I donated it to Goodwill.Never again will I order this way.NOT PLEASED"
3,"""La Fille du Régiment"" in italian","Interesting to ear the italian version of this very well known french Opéra-comique. This live performance is charming but give us small scale singing from the two lead singers. Grist, musical as always, tend to staw away from too much virtuosity for which the role of Marie (or, should I say, Maria...) is celebrated for. GQ."
4,Fire Lash #210,"Fire Lash is the 210th book in the Executioner Series by Don Pendleton and the first book in The Red Dragon Trilogy. In this book, our hero, Mack Bolan takes on the Chinese triads. Bolan starts in San Francisco, makes his way through the United States and Canada and ends up in London tracking down the elements of the triads. He must stop the triads illicit operations in drugs, sex and other crimes."
5,excellent book,This is an interesting book that gave me more insight to the ancient Egyption culture. It arrived in good time and in excellent condition.
5,Great little GPS!!!,"This little unit works flawlessly. Paired effortlessly with my VX6700, and I was navigating with TomTom in minutes. Some of the best features:-Uses the same battery as a Nokia 6xxx series cell phone, so if the battery dies (as most do after about 3 years), just get a cheap generic replacement.-Uses mini usb charger (the same type as my PDA), and you can use it as a usb gps is your computer doesn't have bluetooth.-Great battery life. I have been using it off and on for 3 weeks and have not charged it once.-Great reception. I can pick up 4 sattelites sitting inside at my desk!"
5,you will never be lost again,"When i first bought this product, i was scared because its so cheap it mite not be real and wouldnt work.at the first when i was tryin to align it, it was afternoon, and i went to top of my houses roof(i m in middle east, its summer so imagine on top of the roof at afternoon when temp goes around 50C) and i did a mistake of truning my Navigon software along with the GPS software provided and it took me a couple of minutes to realize i need to run one software only to make it work. but when i restarted my JASJAR, and started Navigon (ofcourse i paired the devices), it just worked and never gives me less then 9 settelites.I went to Salalah and it showed me the way and helped me get back home from mountains and deserts even tho Salalah was always cloudy, never saw the blue sky, but still it would get settelites within 15 seconds. unbelivable. too good to be true"
5,Great Proformer.,"This Bluetooth GPS work great with my Notebook and Pocket Pc, easy setup no problems so far with different software I use."
2,Does Not Work Well With My Smartphone,"I did not realize I had to purchase a compatible map program to go with this product. When I tried it on my smartphone, it shut down my ability to receive calls also."
1,Very poor handling and Product,I have bought the GPS recently - and it took me a good week to set it up - coz the GPS just wouldnt connect based on the SINGLE PAGE INSTRUCTION booklet they give. then i had to contact Customer Support in TAIWAN!!!!!!! for gods sake!! and once i installed it - i realsed they dont have the NAVIGATION software come in the CD with it!! its only a GPS locator - that will tell u which longitude and latitude u r at! BIG HELP!!!!!!!!!
4,Screeching Weasel revives the punk spirit!,"Welcome back to the world of good punk music! After the devastatingly terrible Bark Like a Dog and How to Make Enemies and Irritate People efforts, SW finally get their act back together. This CD is ten-and-a-half minutes of Reborn Punk from the midwestern rodents."
2,Screeching Weasel is NOT punk rock,"Okay, this album kinda stinks in its own little way, but is good for the ""new sound"" SW. More punkish than the stuff I adore, it has a bite to it that prevents me from relegating it to the Anthem pile. Screeching Weasel is NOT about punk rock, Ben says so.. :) So why did they release this?"
1,"Tub was either dirty or moldy inside, had to throw away without using!!","Save your money - either they are using old, dirty tubs to put the udder balm in, or they're doing something that leaves them moldy, which I'm sure ruins the balm.Nasty, gross, possibly dangerous, and a TOTAL waste of money!"
5,Utopia: An Ideal of Perfection,"This is a true, undeniable classic of the power pop genre. This extraordinary collection of musicians demonstrates their musical genius without being flashy or pretentious at all. For that, check out the same musicians on Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell. I never get tired of Feet Don't Fail Me Now, Hammer in my Heart, Princess of the Universe, or Bad Little Actress. There goes my Inspiration is my favorite though, a great melody, unusual unmatched lyrics, and soaring harmonies. It's a masterpiece, and every time I listen to it I picture myself on the left bank of the Seine struggling to find my muse.I owned this record in the 1982-83 era and bought this Canadian version last year. Its pure enjoyment and doesn't deserve to wallow in obscurity. These songs stand the test of time. Casual fans today would love this stellar effort; great melodies, tight harmonies and clever lyrics never go out of style."
5,Heaven 17 & Ambrosia are Electro Nirvana but I want Utopia!,"One Word: Hammer In My Heart! Actually four, but it Rocks as Hard as anything Todd ever did. Tempo: Bang The Drum All Day. Topic: Love Song (possibly about how Thor finds women!) WAIT! ""HERE IT GOES AGAIN!"" A great album you could buy just for this song and not feel cheated one bit! Feats Don't Fail You NOW: on the way to the store. ROCK has never Danced This Hard!"
5,Utopia,"One of my favorite albums! Item came as described, without any problems. I would definitely purchase from the seller again."
3,Utopia,"Not as good as I expected. A few really good songs, but overall I thought it was a flop for Todd Rundgren."
5,Truly amazing!,"Perhaps one of the best pianists of the century plays the music that saved his life...Highlights are the Bach recording, which is thrilling and brilliantly played, and the two (count them!) recordings of Chopin's nocturne. Played with tons of emotion--keep in mind this particular piece saved his life--the last recording especially is truly heart-rending.For anybody who's ever heard a piano and liked it, or for any classical music person, this is an absolute must. I listen to it over and over, and never get tired of it. It's unfortunate he didn't record CDs and CDs and more CDs of stuff I could go out and buy. You need this CD.Even if, like me, you have yet to see the movie.And a special thanks to the Polish radio people, who salvaged these for our immense delight in listening!"
4,Nostalgia,This is an 'enhanced' cd.CD includes a video of Szpilman performing Chopin's Nocturne C# Minor (1980).Insert is full of photos with a brief life history.
3,Didn't know what to expect,An amazingly varied sampling of Szpilman's output. I prefer the movie soundtrack for the classical pieces. The lighter pieces are unexpected and enjoyable. A tribute to his creativity and love of life.
3,Cute but not great,"This book was cute and nice for a ""nothing serious"" kind of summer read, but the plot just kind of fell apart toward the end and you're left scratching your head at the huge leaps in storyline. I got mine cheap, so I'm not disappointed, but don't pay full price for this one!"
4,Fun enjoyable read,"Wendy Holden's Farm Fatale is chalked full of characters that are well built and entertaining. This story is about 2 couples moving to the country side from busy London and their struggles and adventures in adapting to country life. I really enjoyed this book. It was light, fun and entertaining. If you are looking for something to just relax and enjoy, you won't be sorry with this book."
1,Muddled Mess,"This book has an interesting premise that is ruined by poor execution, thoroughly detestable characters and asinine dialogue. The main heroine basically has to choose between three moody, insensitive jerks, the only difference being their occupations. Too many characters, all of them underdeveloped and none of them likeable. Campy pop culture references and throw away dialogue.I wish I could bill the author for the wasted hours I spent on this mess. A beach book? Sure, use it as a coaster or as a sand shovel."
3,An Entertaining Read That Loses Steam At The End,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two thirds of Farm Fatale. Yes, it was definitely lightweight literature. But, the characters were well defined, the setting was established as an integral part of the story, and the prose was liberally sprinkled with wonderful wit.By the time I got to the end of the book, I realized that what I had thought was being elegantly constructed was simply a house of cards waiting to collapse. And, collapse it does in its last third. The weight of both overly contrived situations and plot lines that go nowhere more than offset the strengths that were exhibited in the first part of the manuscript.Overall, this isn't a horrible book. In fact, it could be easily classified as excellent ""beach reading"". But, there are more substantive ""chick-lit"" books elsewhere in the market that deserve purchase before Farm Fatale."
4,"Slow Begining, But Lots of Laughs","This is the type of book that you read for fun. The start is slow, yet the plot quickly catches on. A good choice for the beach or vacation. Holden's writing style is clear and details are good. Even though there are numerous books of this nature available, I found Farm Fatale to be one of the better examples."
3,"A Light, Fun Read","""Farm Fatale"" (or ""Pastures Neuveaux"" as it was originally named in Britain) was a lightweight but very readable saga of two different women who turned their backs on London life to seeker greener pastures - both for very different motives. The two story lines parallel each other for much of the book but they do inevitably intertwine towards the end. The book is funny and, for me, it was just the remedy I needed to drag myself out of a reading slump - it definitly kick-started my reading juices."
3,Slow starting but enjoyable romantic comedy,"This story of 2 couples - who couldn't be more different - finding their lives entangled when they leave London for the countryside promises to be frothy, fluffy fun. Unfortunately, the opening chapters that introduce us to struggling illustrator Rosie, her newspaper columnist boyfriend Mark, self-styled actress Samantha, and her wealthy executive husband Guy, are overly long and tiresome. Eventually, both couples end up in the same village. Among the colorful characters are a brooding, handsome dairy farmer and a reclusive rock star. Once Rosie meets them the boy-meets-girl fun begins, and though it never quite reaches its silliness potential, it's fluffy enough for a quick summer read."
4,Good Chick-Lit In the Country,"Wendy Holden's (author of Simply Divine and Bad Heir Day) latest novel ""Farm Fatale"" is a hilarious ride into the country, full of all your favorite exploits including a fur covered friend or two.Holden's humor and whit really shine in this latest book. I find her a real treat and remarkably creative. Her work never follows a traditional path but still appeals to the masses. Defiantly one of the better British writers out there. She's a bit off center - that's what makes her different and enjoyable."
3,Issues with Kindle version,"I enjoy this book as a light, fluffy read. However, the Kindle version is missing words, has some typos, and in at least one place is missing an entire scene. Disappointing."
4,great dvd,this brings back childhood memories.i prefer black and white but my kids enjoy watching in color.you get both options.
5,March of the Wooden Soldiers,This is a classic which i viewed on television for many years. Thoughtis was about i bought a copy for myself. You never know when theymight discontinue showing it on television during the Christmas Holiday.
5,Babes in Toyland!,"A classic in my family!, You're sure to love the sweet humor and innocence of this wonderful little film! You can never go wrong with Laurel and Hardy... I prefer the black and white version, but I watched the color version, and it was nice."
2,March of the Wooden Soldiers,"A bit dissapointed w/ the video quality - I believe it mostly had to do with restoration / conversion process used; specifically, it is apparent that frames were dropped, likely due to the quality - end resuly is a video that is a little choppy.Otherwise it's a great old movie I remember from my childhood back in the 50's - used to come on TV right around Christmas."
3,Monkey in costume,"My favorite part of this movie is the monkey that wears a costume that looks like some rip-off of an early version of Mickey Mouse. He responds stangely to the music a guy in a cat costume is playing in a town celebration - alternately writhing on the stairs and applauding. Later, in the battle scene, he flys around in a blimp dropping darts on the bogeymen who invade Toyland."
2,A Colorized Version in Partial B & W,"I bought this version because it sounded from the reviews to be one of the best restorations available. I am a B&W junkie and believe movies should be preserved in their original form. However, I got stuck watching it in color because of a technical issue with our DVD player. I found the colorization job that was done to be garish in some areas but completely weak in others. What really amused me was the fact that the ""colorizers"" left so many things uncolorized. Some are subtle and in the background and others are quite obvious. I spent most of the movie picking out areas that they didn't bother to colorize. Apparently they were too lazy or felt the audience was too ""dull"" to notice. It really irritated me to see this careless treatment of such a classic. As far as the restoration is concerned, I felt that it was fairly decent. I have yet to see the B&W version so I can't comment on that."
5,Great fun for the ENTIRE family,"The GREATEST comedy team in movie history,STAN LAUREL & OLIVER HARDY, star in this whimiscal, musicl fairy tale base on Vicotr Hubert's famed 1903 operetta 'BABES IN TOYLAND'. The boys portray 'STANNIE DUM & OLLIE DEE', hapless employees of Toyland's toy factory, who room in 'MOTHER PEEP'S'shoe. Faced with eviction by the evil 'SILAS BARNABY',our heros' plan to get the money from the 'TOYMASTER' goes awry. It seems that Santa Claus ordered 600 wooden soldiers at 1 foot high. But as fate would have it -STANNIE took the order and the end result is 100 wooden soldiers at 6 foot high. As with all the other films that i have reviewed, I also have this movie in my video library collection. I STRONGLY suggest and urge all buyers and viewers to order this timeless classic for their own video library collection."
3,A classic,Cute movie. I love Laurel and Hardy. I bought it after my brother in law recommended it to me. It was pretty entertaining.
5,Memories relived,I am 56 years of age and I awaited the arrival of my video like a child at Christmastime. March of the Wooden Soldiers has been a holiday favorite of mine for many years. This copy is a welcome addition to my collection...I recommend this movie to children of ALL ages.
5,The only version to own,"It's not Christmas without the Laurel and Hardy version of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"". This is also the only version to purchase. It might not be as cheap as the others on Amazon but the production company did an excellent job refining the movie. This version also has the opportunity for the user to view in BW or Color. The extra's are awesome too. Definately worth the money."
4,old favorite,"As a child I watched this film with my brothers...it was a great Christmas ""memory"" present. He now has it in his film library."
5,Fun,I always liked this film as a child in the 1960s. I remember when it use to come on television on Thanksgiving Day. It is funnyand fun for the whole family to watch. I recommend buying this film.
3,Appears,"Picture appears to be in bleached out color so one would assume it was the colorized version. Not so, it's black and white. I did another search on Amazon and found the colorized version as well as black and white on the same disc. That's the way to go"
3,Don't be fooled by the reviews below on this version,"I recently bought this although I already have the very nice colorized Goodtimes version, also available here. However, due the reviews below I was led to believe that this was a version I was seeking which included a choice of both the color & B&W; versions, restoration of ""Babes in Toyland"" title cards, and perhaps even a bit of restored footage.The title card part is true. However, this disc contains only the B&W; version. Apparently this SAME review & others like it appear on the Amazon page for a 2010 release, which may or not contain all the extras mentioned below. Reviews should be posted ONLY on the product page to which they apply. I was misled, and, ultimately, ripped off."
5,Classic!,"An all time Chirstmas classic! Used to be a regular on TV during the season, but apparently it disappeared. Nice to find it streaming on Amazon, especially in black & white. Kooky, yes. But lots of details and a fun story. My kids love it."
3,March of the Wooden Soldiers,I used to watch this movie on TV when I was a young girl. It usually came on around Christmas time. Its just as fun today as it was then. Stan and Ollie never fail to entertain.
4,DVD of a classic,"Tried to find this movie everywhere, of course Amazon had it. If you made it this far then you probably already know about the movie but it was definitely worth the buy. Loved it!"
2,Brightness issue on Legend Film's DVD is also on the Blu-ray,"The Legend Films DVD release was improperly mastered with both the B/W and color versions overly bright, and that error has been maintained with the mastering the Blu-ray. There are no blacks, just light grays, and the tonal balance is all off and wan. One must significantly lower the brightness on one's display to get an acceptable image. The colorizing looks much better as well when darkened. I'm of the feeling that the image was brightened for colorizing, but then it wasn't darkened again (as it should've been) before final mastering.As far as the HD upgrade, it is minor. It appears that a great deal of digital noise reduction was used, leaving patterns and edges of objects rather waxy. It also shows up how some of the colors bleed over on different objects. I only paid about $9 fo this Blu-ray, but come on... At LEAST get the brightness issue corrected!Legend Films - why?!"
1,I hate color on dvd - March of the Wooden Soliders.,My favorite is March of the Wooden Soldiers since i was kid. I do not like COLOR!!! I hate that. I want to black and white chirstmas... It is beautiful old classic black and white. The color is not great. I won't buy this dvd.
3,Extra footage is great,"Babes In Toyland / March Of The Wooden Soldiers! It is a real classic and thanks to DVD the quality is great to view, It's too bad that colorized films are missing scenes, WHY? The extra footage on the DVD is great, Stan Laurel at his appartment, The legendary ( and as far as I know) only interview with Babe, The trailer of the feature, Oh, these are nice to add to ones collection. The price is right, not too expensive for those little extra things you are looking for as Laurel & Hardy collector, but you should not buy it for the feature itself."
2,Black & White VS Color,My children don't like the movie because it's in black and white and they have seen the movie in color.
5,Best holiday film,This film has always been one of my all time favorites to watch during the holidays. Reminds me of better times from my childhood. Next t o the Abbot & Costello films Laurel & Hardy rock!
3,Required viewing for the Holidays!,I remember watching this movie every Thanksgiving growing up in New York. It was fun to watch again but the letterbox format was a little annoying. The quality is good not stellar but how much can you expect. It is a bit dated but nostalgia smooth out the rough edges.
5,Oh the memories!,"I've looked for this movie for 3 years or so, I never could remember what it was called, then as I was perusing Amazon's Instant Video collection, it just popped out at me! I am so happy right now, so thanks to Amazon, Prime, etc, for making this happen.I remember, starting when I was about 6 or 7, I would watch this video ALL the time, especially around the holidays. I remembered snippets of it into adulthood, (the mangers in the trees) (the monkey throwing bombs) but more than anything I remembered the sheer joy that this movie brought me.So, this isn't much of a review, I'm just sincerely happy that I found this again!"
2,Disappointed in Poor Quality!,"Look, I'm not going to complain about Laurel and Hardy's classic Christmas film, ""March of the Wooden Soldiers,"" otherwise known as the original ""Babes in Toyland."" I know the film was done in the early 1930s in Black and White.Sadly, my DVD has such a poor quality. I couldn't watch the colorized version in the first place. The black and white version was better but not by much. It took about 30 minutes to air 10 minutes of the remaining film.The extras are in the same boat as well. I don't know maybe I got a poor copy in the first place. It's a shame because I really love this Laurel and Hardy film. Maybe I'll get another copy to replace this one. The features included an original cartoon short of ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" and other special shorts.That's why I'm giving it two stars because I really enjoy the film and the extras but I can't with this DVD. I guess I'm going to get it replaced because it's worth it."
4,L&H and the Holidays,Legend Films has done an excellent job of bringing L&H into the modern age with their superb colorization of the definitive adaptation of March of the Wooden Soldiers.
3,"Fine mess as always, but poor copy","It used to be my favorire Laurel and Hardy movie when I was a kid, but watching it again recently, I've found much less interest and shine. On the other hand, my 7-year daughter was laughing watching that movie like I used to have, so I guess the movie still has got some appeal to younger audience. Don't get me wrong, there are some funny parts, but also dull, and acting and singing of secondary characters made me yawn. The quality of the copy - video and audio - very poor and color rendering not good at all. 3 stars just for Laurel and Hardy making funny faces and silly jokes."
4,Entertaining,"I'm a big fan of Laurel & Hardy. This film is by far their best known film...although I wouldn't call it their best. However it is great for kids and amusing enough for adults to sit through. It's basically about all those old little fairy tale characters we had growing up, all in one little movie. It even has the ""bogeymen""!!!:) It's great for kids, I surely will be sharing this with mine when I have em...in a couple of years or so. Very entertaining for the whole family."
3,Okay movie,The movie is great and it brings back a lot of memories but the only thing that really ruins is the that they colorized it. I to see the original that was black and white and true to the movie. I know that there people waiting out there for that version to come out. I know that I am.
1,Digestively Disgusted...,"I have taken the Original Papaya Enzyme tablets (not purchased here on Amazon)and had a great experience with them. I was hoping for an even greater experience with these hence the name SUPER Papaya Enzyme PLUS, but I am terribly disappointed. The smell upon opening the bottle was/is horrible (like dirty mildewed socks and peppermint). They make me very nauseous, my stomach bubbly, and causes me to pass gas a lot. And they have a nasty chalky taste. They remind me of Tums (yuck), yet three times the price. I will not purchase these again!"
1,"MINTY flavored, NOT fruity","All other brands of papaya enzyme tablets I've used have a nice fruity, papaya flavor. These taste just like Rol-aids. Yuck! They may work fine, I don't know. I don't like mint, so I'm paying $6 to send them back."
3,Taste bad,I prefer the Natural Brand taste of real papaya. This is like a nasty mint. I will use it but not purchasing this brand again.
3,Recommended ONLY for the neophyte,"If you've read anything about Hendrix beyond the liner notes you will find little new here beyond the author's personal memories of seeing Jimi in concert. The actual analysis of the album is spotty at best, shedding very little light (or anything of real interest for that matter) on this masterpeice of rock music.Considering the cost of this tiny book, there is very little bang for your buck."
5,Examines Hendrix's unique talent using the album,"Jimi Hendrix's rock pinnacle Electric Ladyland was one of the best guitar albums ever made for the genre, affording Hendrix the creative expression and freedom he needed for the first time. John Perry examines Hendrix's unique talent using the album as a foundation for his analysis. Electric Ladyland's short stature may make it a difficult library loan, but any fan of the Hendrix sound will consider it an essential guide."
1,Thumbs down,"Ya need this if you are a complete Hendrix nut. But the author attempts musicological analysis where people like Velvert Turner, Wolf Marshall, Andy Aledort, and others have done an excellent job already. I needed some historical and political analysis but none was forthcoming, mostly because the author is an Englishman and deals with Hendrix through that social lens. This is an otherwise excellent series of books, but I implore the publisher to get a Yank to do another one on Hendrix. Maybe someone affiliated with the Hendrix museum up in Seattle, Washington USA. Heck, let ME write the Hendrix volume. I have all the bios, recordings; even the instruments and effects of the sort used by Hendrix. I'll write the publisher directly and see if they'll give me the gig."
1,Worst Ever!,"Being a computer engineer, I have never touched half the FE material. This book barely touched on the subjects, and some not at all. Full of misspellings, grammatical mistakes, I highly do *NOT* recommend this book. The only thing I used was the practice exam which is available in other books."
1,Jehanne is an unfaithful tramp. Not romantic.,"Ok, I'll admit I didn't get past the first 24 pages, but by that point, I knew all I needed to know. I normally really love Jo Beverly, so this was an extra disappointment.The book starts in a place where most romance books END. Jehanne and Galeran are already married, have a child and Jehanne has had an adulterous affair and had a second child while her husband is away at war in the holy lands for three long years. All Galeran can think of while he is away is his lovely wife and child, and he comes home to find she's replaced him with someone else AND had her lover's child! That is SO unromantic. What is the point of reading further? I already hate Jehanne and frankly, think she's a tramp with no morals.All the other reviews I've read solidify my feelings about this book. If you love a sweet romance, this is not for you."
4,Two stories in one,"I read this book BEFORE I started on Dark Champion mainly because it takes place PRIOR to that book.I can't say I hated the book because I didn't. I just couldn't (for whatever reason) get into it like I did Lord of Midnight. I struggled through it but wanted to find out what happened to the characters.I gave it four stars because toward the end of the book I FINALLY was able to become emotionally involved with both Galeran and Jehanne. Prior to that, although I liked them both, neither character moved me, except for when Galeran went before King Henry, then I was interested in how it all turned out.I did enjoy the secondary romance between Raoul and Jehanne's cousin Aline. I absolutely loved how Raoul found ways to storm Aline's ""castle""."
1,Sooo disappointed,The heroine is weak. The betrayal is overwhelming. I just wanted Galeran to beat Jehanne and move on and find a more virtuos woman. He could do better than this slut. She doesn't even seem guilty! I'm so distraught over this storyline. I can't believe Jo Beverly wrote.
5,One of Beverley's best,I love Jo Beverley's romance and this is one of her best-to be recommended along with Emily and the Dark Angel and My Lady Notorious. The plot was deeper than most of hers.
4,I'm glad I read on...,"Initially it was really hard for me to get through the book. Not because it wasn't good, but because I hated the heroine, Jehanna. Every couple of chapters I had to stop reading because I couldn't stand her and upset at Galeran, for being so forgiving. I almost stopped reading the book, but decided to trudge on. Finally Aline and Raoul happened... Thank goodness! Aline and Raoul, having their own side story in the book, was a great reprieve from your feelings towards Jehanna. Overall, it's a great story if you can get pass your dislike of the heroine. You'll sympathize with Galeran. enjoy the battle between Aline and Raoul and you may find yourself teary eyed when Galeran finally mourns for his son."
3,Grossly Overpriced @ $400.+,"A number of the projects are well written and photographed, but at its current out-of-print price, these are costly lessons.Money better spent on McCreight, Von Neumann, Codina, and Morton. The Penland or Untracht books are a much better value.No granulation, mokume gane, or enameling?...a few of the more advanced processes are ignored.Project 18 outlines the construction of a box clasp. Revere's method of laying-out the housing is fraught with difficulties, as the measurements and depth of filing, etc., require extreme precision to eventuate in a truly rectangular box. Carpenters understand this additive-error principle. There are better ways to do this. Figure P18-7 illustrates this, as the housing ready for soldering is not perfectly aligned.Revere was reputedly coming out with a revised second edition, which would cost under $100.?"
2,Didn't Fit!,"The product was fine, however, the product did not fit our truck. A professional mechanic tried to install it and advised that it was not the right size for our vehicle as stated in the product description!"
4,Nothing new to a veteran,"The ideas presented in this book are old news and common sense. I've been implementing many of these ideas for a long time without the help of any books.If you are a newcomer to marketing, there are plenty of excellent ideas you can draw from, most of them work across multiple industries.Overall, I found this a very basic book."
2,Not believable at any level,"It became obvious that the author loosely bases his tales on very little fact. This isn't to say that there aren't criminals and ne'er-do-wells in Japan (as in the rest of the world) but if you were to pick a crime...say, stealing motorcycles...and then write a story with two main characters, a love interest, a few antagonists, you'd be doing exactly what is done here. In the end, I think it a little sophomoric to think that we should be shocked by what we read, when what we are reading here is obviously fiction based on fact. Whenever conversations between two characters takes place, you know the author wasn't present for those conversations, whenever a crime is discussed, you know the author is guessing as to how it was done."
2,mislabeled and misinformed,"The back cover copy should read something like ""Greenfeld reprints so-so interviews with his friends (real and imaginary) in a manner that shows you that this book is messily taped together."""
3,A Generous Three Stars,"Speed Tribes served as an interesting snippet of Japanese youth culture in the late 80's. This book certainly spanned the gambit. Greenfeld's topics ranged from street racing motorcycle cliques to a socio-philosophical chapter regarding the Japanese fascination with technology.Although lacking in any far-reaching theory on Japanese society, Greenfeld did write a series of interesting stories and anecdotes, some rife with humor, while others maintained a slightly melancholy vibe. But, it was hard to accept his book as much more than simple stories. It lacked any kind of journalistic bite. The book read like a pseudo-compilation of tales regurgitated on to the printed page, following late-night booze sessions in some Tokyo bar.All in all, it is a three star book. It is something to read. However, it is not shelf worthy material. Pick it up at the library, don't buy it."
4,"Very interesting, but somewhat disjointed...","I had thought the book was supposed to be an analysis of one particular portions of the sub cultures of Japan, the speed tribes; however, the book looks at many different sub cultures that are not 'traditional japanese' culture. Very interesting, and informative, but I would have preferred more investigation in many areas."
1,"Dreadful, utterly dreadful","I live in Japan and was terribly disappointed by this work. Greenfield pitches this as a documentary but it's anything but, pure fiction and not even good fiction at that. Has he even been to Japan? I doubt it. Never I have I seen such a blatant attempt to stereotype modern Japanese culture in the latest cyberpunk style with the only aim being to make money. Avoid this book! I didn't want to give it a single star, but the Amazon rating system forces me to. A big zero would be far more appropriate."
4,It is true...as each story represents a certain countercultural type.,"The books does offer some very good insights into Japanese culture, many between the lines.I have met a few escort girls, they are very much like the woman in the book. I have even had a drink or two with a couple of speed tribe members, and they are very much like the book's description. There is a lot of truth in this book, and shows the dirtier side of Japanese culture. Every culture has such ""low-lifes"", and tries to hide them. Japan is just more aggressive about it. Consider this a look under the hood, at the grimier parts of the culture, that are nevertheless part of what makes it run.s.The only criticism I have is that it is getting a bit dated. We need a new speed tribes book, to cover some of the latest issues."
4,See modern Japan from this unqiue viewpoint,"Author Karl Taro Greenfeld had a job working in Japan in the late 80s, writing for Japan's largest English-language newspaper. Tiring of his tech and real estate reports, he turned his writing to the evolution of modern Japan during the ""bubble"" ecomony. He was able to observe first-hand the growth and decadence of youth culture during this vibrant period.Greenfeld touches upon the clash between Western influence and traditional Japanese culture. His blend of fiction and non-fiction take us along with a group of Japanese and foreign young people trying to find their place in present-day Japan. Facets explored include gang culture, the porn industry, drug trafficking, the vast industry of stolen motorcycles, and many more aspects not normally reported upon in the West."
1,Utter drivel - a fairy story,"This book is unbelievably bad. Look, I live in Japan and I can't believe that this joker has ever been here. This book is becoming something of a legend in the foreign community here as it's just so incredibly untrue. Where did this guy do his research, sci-fi movies? Come and live here Karl and when you've got a few years under your belt then, and only then, you'll be in a position to talk. Until you've done that then kindly label your juvenile dribblings as 'teenage fiction'. Better still just shut up until you actually know what you're talking about. There should be a zero star rating on Amazon because I feel really nauseated at having to give this 'book' any stars at all."
3,Description a little misleading,"I was really excited when I read the review/description about this book because I thought it was going to give detailed information about what asanas are good for particular seasons of the year. The book turned out to be a 12 month guide to learn poses and history about yoga - very useful information, but not exactly what I was looking for. The description of how to get into the poses was very detailed, but as someone who already knows how to do the poses, I found some of the pictures confusing or just incorrect. I would recommend this book for a beginner who wants to slowly immerse themselves in the history of yoga and gradually learn new poses. However, if you are looking for a book that really relates each pose to the corresponding season and gives the benefits of doing certain poses during certain times of the year (as I was) then this book is not for you."
2,I tried very hard,"Sutherland's voice was tired and heavy and slow. I wanted to like this very much because I love Sutherland, but to my knowledge the only singer who kept his voice so long was Kraus. I highly do not recommend this CD. The last piece on it (Una voce poco fa) came to life some and I liked it and if the whole disc had been at least of that caliber I would have liked it and would keep it. Everything seemed slow, and as though it had all been transposed down a few steps, and there were no fireworks (except the last number). Of course, this album is called Bel Canto Arias, not Coloratura Arias. Some may like it."
5,Wicked cool,Since my parents are still deciding whether I can get a real pair of sais I settled for these. See I'm a hardcore Xena fan and i try to collect any weapons from the show. These toy sais have covered a nice hole from my Xena weapons collection and I am forever grateful. They are great fun to play with though the one with the batterys in it makes it hard to swing the sai. The sound effects are great! All you gotta do is to come in contact with something and it makes a metal clashing metal sound. It's amazing. A great buy especially if you like weapons that come with sound effects.
2,bad crystal,the crystal scratches very easily...not a good watch if you can't read the display! I tried to clean it but no good.
3,casio,Watch looks good. band is nice with the velcro. Problem with the am/pm setting as it will not allow the proper setting changes at noon not midnight.
1,Poor quality and poor company,The watch lasted 2 weeks. Casio wants me to pay to ship back a 2 week old watch. The watch is junk and Casio has poor customer support. Look elsewhere.
1,Watch review,"I bought two of these watches and are going to return. First of all the instruction book was micro fine and I had to have greatly enlaged to view. Secondly I've yet to enter the basic time/date functions in either. The buttom system, etc., etc. is crazy. The light is next to worthless (whereas my older Casio was great and simple to program). I would NOT recommend this unit to anyone............."
1,Casio Men's World Time Data Bank Watch #AW80V-5BV,I am very dissaponted. The Photo doesnt show the very ugly velcro wrist band going the entire length of the longer band. Its a waste of money.
3,"nice, but setting time a hassle","I have owned this watch for a year, long enough for it to gain about 90 seconds. Setting it forward is easy, but setting it backward is a pain. You must hold down a button as it slowly moves FORWARD a complete 24 hours and you hope you can let go of the button quickly enough to be accurate. I find I use the watch less and less due to this quirk."
3,practical and handsome watch,"I just ordered this item and have yet to see how reliable it is . But it is a handsome everyday , knockaround watch , and costs a fraction of what a comparable wenger or swiss army would cost . Assuming it lasts as long as the battery(10 years) , looks like a good deal for the price.I gave it 3 stars on appearance alone."
2,10 years? How about 10 weeks?,"This watch is very thin and light, and about what you would expect for the price. The illuminator function is weak at best. It turns of automatically after just a second and holdnig down the button does nothing. All that would be acceptable if the company's claims of a ten year battery were true. My battery lasted about three months before dying in the middle of the night. I took the watch to have the battery replaced and was told that not only did they not carry the battery, but they were not allowed to open the back of the watch and would have to send it back to the manufacturer. All in all a disappointing experience."
5,Casio Men's AW80V-5BV,I just bought this watch 2 days ago but I'm already impressed. Great features and price. If the battery lasts 10 years like it is advertised I'll be amazed. I'll come back and update this review in 10 years!
4,Great watch...,Its a great watch.....very sporty look....both analog and digital display........velcro strap fits nicely on the wrist......LED light illuminator is not that great........only 50m WR...better if it would have been 100 m WR.
4,Good and inexpensive,"I've had this watch for 5 years and worn it almost every day. I bought it because it had a cloth Velcro band and it had an hourly beep. It has stood up pretty well, especially considering I am tough on watches. In the past I would usually get only 2 years out of a watch, but this one has done really well. If you just need a general every day watch, you can't go wrong with this."
5,A gift to a friend,"A military friend of mine (retired), whom I forced a gift idea from, told me his old watch was no longer functioning correctly. I had only two requirements when I started looking for a watch. No MASSIVE/ridiculous face that looks like a cartoon, and it must either have a canvas or leather wrist band.This watch fit my requirements perfectly.He seemed to be very happy with his gift and it made me happy to see him smile.Thanks"
2,Complicated!!!!,"I own 15 watches, digital and analog. This has the most complicated sequences to set and change time/date/ etc on any watch I have ever used."
3,Battery life is longer than the watch life,"I bought this watch because I travel quite a bit and I wanted something that could tell me what time it was at home. Setting the watch is somewhat complicated as it does not have a stem as most watches do, but rather four buttons that must be pressed in a certain sequence depending on what you are trying to do. Overall I like the watch, but it quit working about one and a half years into it's life. A ten year battery is nice, but what good is it if the watch dies after two years!!!"
2,mineral window,the mineral window schatches quicker and more easily than any plastic windows i've ever owned. is it mineral or plastic. tell me
3,Too complicated for its own good,"It has a neat, sporty look but it is a maze of push button C six times to get to the up and down to set the time on this screen and then push button A to set this and button B if you want that. Fine as long as you have the little booklet with you, but otherwise forget it. I got it for the alarm function which is barely audible. I used to use my old casio as an alarm clock but this one will never suffice. I realize you get what you pay for, but I expected more from Casio based on past experience."
3,show me the light,"it took wel over an hour to set all the dials, times,etc only not til the dark of night---pushed for the light which comes on for a mini second not enabling you to read the time in a flash and mymluminous dial didnt work---what now i m not thrilled with my watch"
4,I am verry happy with my Casio Watch,I was very pleased with the quality of the Casio watch that I recently purchased at Amazon. It has the Velcro strap that are very easy put on your wrist . The watch itself tells time with nice fluorescent hands or a digital letters.It also has the world clock on it which I don't use but its still there. It has a 10 year battery which I alway like. you can buy cheep watches but you get just that. The price of this watch was very afforadable. It also looks nice when you are dressed up and are out and about. Yes Casio watches do a great job at a low price and last a long time.
