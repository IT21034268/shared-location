3,Nothing unexpected here,"I was looking forward to reading this, as I know nothing about Ms. Bankhead. Halfway through, I still feel as if I'm reading about a stranger. The anecdotes are amusing but I don't see much effort on her part to go beyond and express some insight. It's as if she were on a talk show.In comparison, both of Bette Davis' books held my interest because she revealed her feelings about what happened to her. And I don't mean just for example, saying that her stomach was fluttering if she was nervous, or other clichés that Ms. Bankhead falls back on. After having read several other autobiographies, this one is okay, but a bit tepid."
5,The Alabama Foghorn!,"I can just imagine her speaking the words written here on these pages and I like her even more than i already did if that were even possible! In fact of the other 4 biographies i have about Tallulah, next to ""The Life & Times Of A Leading Lady"" by Joel Lobenthal, this was my favorite!! We would have been great friend I truly think had i been born then, maybe not but i certainly believe it!"
5,USA,"Needed a flag to rep the nation i love, i was raised in and born in. Thanks you for the flag. Well done and timely delivered."
2,More filler than thriller,"I started using this book during my sophomore year of college and found it to be a bit rough. While the text does do a good job with proofs of theorems and propositions, it fails to show why calculus is important to a math/science student.In many instances of the text, the material is explained, and the reader is assumed to have comprehended every word without second sight. Then, some of the problems are given and certain stipulations to some arrise and the reader is to assume to have known about it.Bottom line, the book is great for those who already know, but for someone learning calculus the first time, I would suggest Larson."
1,"This is a bad CD, avoid it. It's from her early years.",This is a bad CD. There are 2 songs on it. OH MY!!! ( Edit MIx) and OH MY!!! (Disco Mix). They are unbearable to listen to. They were written and produced by Otto Von Wernherr mostly. These CD is from the early years before 1983 when she became famous. I'm sure if Madonna had any say in writing or producing the CD it would have been a lot better.
2,lacks,originality that is. What it turns out to be is a rehash of qabalistic correspondences that lack any sort of depth. Was expecting a lot more than superficial association of ideas.
1,Pennsbury book,"The item was listed as a 1997 publication, however, it was only a 1991 plublication date which I already have. i was looking for an updated version, so I have returned the item.If there should actually be a 1997 version, I would not mind being contacted so that I may re-order it.Thank youKay A Whitney"
2,"Cheap, verging on junk","This is the cable to buy only if you are looking for the cheapest possible connection between your video devices. It's excessively stiff, the connectors are hard to screw down, and the quality of materials looks and feels below par. You can find a better product elsewhere on Amazon and from other vendors. Don't waste money on this."
4,The Abundance Course,I have taken this course before and found Larry Crane's new book to help me continue on with the process I have learned in his classes. I find the book very beneficial. Didn't really like the small print. Other than that it is an excellent choice for those that want to grown and enhance their life.
1,Confusing!,"It is fortunate that he instructs how to release at the beginning of this book because I needed to release the frustration from reading it. This book is repetitive and confusing. For example: You can have anything you want as long as you don't want it. WHAT? Then later: The worst thing to do is to suppress a desire. Wait a minute--aren't desires and wants the same thing? First you're to let go of wants, then the worst thing you can do is suppress them. Early in the book the reader is told you're not supposed to want control, but in a later chapter the reader is told that if you take responsibility you will have control. Okay, so there is a difference, but it is so slight, so subtle, it only adds to the confusion.The quotes at chapter headings attributed to Lester Levenson are succinct and clear. If only the chapters themselves were so.I am glad other people found this book helpful, but reading this book left me confused and depressed."
1,The Abundance Book,"Mr. Cranes book appears to be taped material from a workshop, as a student of the Sedona Method I found it quite disappointing,"
1,Not abundant at all,Don't believe every review you see. They are written mostly for people that never reviewed anything else and during a very short period of time. Very fishy indeed... I have tried to read the book. An absolutely bore. Don't waste time and money in that. I also purchased the audio. Very good for sleeping. It's all hot air.
5,Great Loppers,"My old loppers were about 15 years old and had been sharpened repeatedly, but when the handle finally started falling apart it was time for a new one. These Fiskar's loppers are wonderful! The PowerGear makes it easy to cut branches up to 1.5"" or 2"" (depending on the type of wood). I didn't find that I had to open the handles any wider than on other loppers, so that isn't an issue to me.I have a lot of landscaping and these loppers make it much easier for an early-50's woman like myself to keep my yard neat and trim."
4,just what I needed,"I live on 3 acres mostly woods. These loppers are a real time and arm saver. They cut throught most any limb with very little effort. My 8 year old son even uses them, under dad's watchful eyes. In short the work great . I am very happy with them."
2,Nice while it lasted,"Seemed well-built and sturdy, and it did cut pretty well until it lost a 1-inch chunk in the middle of the sharp blade, rendering it utterly useless. I've only had it for a couple months, using infrequently for light work around the yard. Very disappointing."
4,Pruner feedback,"Best loppers I have used to date, inc. Craftsman and Corona. Short length of 25"" helps when working in tight places. Mechanism is fairly simple and appears to be rugged. Materials top quality, i.e. aluminum handles, Teflon coating, steel cutters. Mechanical advantage of gear drive is great. These loppers can slice thru a 2"" tree but it does take some shoulder/arm strength to do so. (This is the reason I only rated 4 stars.) Next time I will consider the telescopic version."
5,Nice and Sharp and Powerful,"These loppers do a great job of cutting thicker limbs on my hedges. I snapped the blade off my last one and these are working much better for me with less effort on my part. I don't enjoy trimming the hedges, so anything that makes it easier is a huge deal to me."
5,pleased,Cuts well. Rugged. Love that Fiskars honors its' warranty with NO problems. Good for pruning branch sizes as per instructions
4,Some very cute and nice projects,"I am new to crocheting, but I love this book. I haven't tried any of the projects yet, but I found several that I definitely want to make soon! These projects do not look anything like the typical crochet of the 1970's. They are updated and beautiful! It has some gorgeous afghans; very cute kitchen projects (rugs/potholders); gift ideas ; a pretty baby layette set, lamp shade cover, tissue box cover, baby sandals, and blankets; sweaters; even projects for several different holidays!"
4,For repeated listening,"Its hard to imagine an album rivaling King's ""Tapestry"" in creativity and satisfaction, but ""Thoroughbred"" nearly matches. Carole sings some of her finest and most intimate songs here. The production is slick and unencumbered. Thoroughly a pleasure, again and again."
5,Another great Carole King album,"Carole King / Thoroughbred: While this is not a masterpiece, it IS a great album. There are several hits on this album and the best way to hear those hits is in the context of the whole album (and every song here is excellent). The fact that this CD is out of print (as of January of 2012) is simply inexcusable, but then, there is no excuse to have ANY of Carole King's albums out of print. This one easily rates Five Stars."
5,Good for learning colors,"This is a simple puzzle to learn colors. I wish the fish part wouldn't fit in every opening. However, my great granddaughter likes to put in wrong color at times to make ""funny fish"". I would recommend."
3,Poorly made,These are wooden with paper glued to the surface. This arrived with the paper covering on one of the fish obviously separated from the wooden surface. I would not recommend this product as it's durability is definitely questionable. I fail to understand why the wooden fish are not painted rather than simply gluing paper over the surface. I would happily pay more for better quality. Unfortunately I inadvertently trashed the packing slip and am therefore unable to return the puzzle. I do not recommend these!Fish Colors Mix N Match Peg Puzzle
4,great puzzle,I got this puzzle for my 3 year old niece.She loves it.She is into building things and changing things so this puzzle is perfect.She can make any color combination she wants!
5,Great puzzle,"We love Melissa and Doug products! Great quality. Daughter loves this puzzle. We match all the colors and then we make it silly and mix it all up. The pieces will all fit in the other sections. She loves sorting it and making it right, after ""we get silly."""
5,Perfect for 2 or 3 year-olds,My son loved this when he was 2. I feel it does a very good job promoting matching and colors.
4,Around the World With A Few Mistakes,"A very enjoyable read, however, there are a number of name references that are wrong and it indicates either sloppy research or editing.There are also some questions about the relevance of some of the observations considering the gap of ten years between the trip itself and the publication of the book."
3,Decent knive for some applications,"For the price, this is a decent knife. However, it lacks the flexibility to do some tasks. If all you need is a boning knife for chicken, this is a good value. If you need to filet fish, you will want something thinner with a more flexible blade."
5,"King at her most prolific, it just doesn't get any better.","""Rhymes & Reasons"" is the next installment in a string of brilliant songwriting and recording projects by Carole King following her phenominally successful ""Tapestry"" album. The songs here are highly personal, introspective, spiritual at times. Musically, one song weaves into the next so effortlessly...each song so thoughtfully arranged with the same soft, accoustical, textural sound. It is such a carefully crafted album project in fact, that when King's boxed set ""A Natural Woman"" was released a few years back, one could immediately identify the two songs excerpted from ""Rhymes & Reasons"" and could recognize that the two tracks belonged originally on this album. King is quite simply at her most prolific here. It doesn't get much better than ""Rhymes & Reasons"". A brilliant project."
4,"Fine Product, but....","I was somewhat disappointed to find that there doesn't seem to be any way to build Web applications with this product running under XP Home Edition. Building ASP.NET apps seems to require IIS, an XP Professional-only feature (I believe; I'm not a guru by any means). Still, there is much to like, foremost being the power of C with the simplicity of VB. Professional programmers would probably find more to about which to gripe (as usual), but for those of us who program mainly to help solve on-the-job problems, this package packs a lot of power for [the money]!"
5,Love C#,"If you are an experienced programmer - move over Java and C++, C# is a great new tool you'll absolutely want to know. If you're a beginner - C# is a superb product. And the newspapers back me up, I believe they said it's doubled in sales in the last 3 months. A very solid language with a great programming environment - Visual Studio .NET, that makes it easier to learn. C# isn't hard to learn, but you really need to learn the .NET Framework to do real programming in it. The .NET Framework has all kinds of add-on capabilities, sort of like having pre-programmed pieces that you add on to C#. It comes with the .NET Framework, but is really a separate, and essential, piece to learn."
4,Absolute awe.,"I took a look and I couldnt believe the combination of J++ andC++! It does what it promises. The code is clean and powerful.I will need some more time with C# to get a better opinion, butso far I am impressed."
1,Ordered over a month ago and I still do not have the product!!!,"Nevermind the star rating, I meant to give this product NO stars. I ordered this a month ago and still haven't received it yet!! How can I give a review of something I don't have? I track it and it's been I transit the whole time! And give me my star back!"
4,Crucified for her art!,"The startling cover of this album, which show's the band's naked female singer nailed to a cross, indicates that this band is truly original. Ms Maclure's vocals are wild and ecstatic, while the band makes an atonal jazzy sound. Not easy listening, by any means."
4,Even better than the Perry original?,"It's a close call. I first purchased the original Perry release ""Who put the voodoo..."" when it was first released about 7 years ago. I liked it straightaway although it took some time to fully appreciate all it had to offer. Now that I have finally purchased this companion c.d. I have even more reason to like and appreciate this material. This is excactly the type of material the Mad Professor is best at toying with. Perry's originals are some of his best work in years; rootsy, ranting, varied in style, and dub-heavy even on it's own. Mad Professor is also at the top of his game using typical ""Mad"" electronic manipulations that pull the funkiest elements from the tunes while not overdoing it (as he is often want to do).Four stars instead of five only because Perry has his ""Secret Laboratory"" to be compared to and Mad Professor has ""No Protection."" Both solid five star outputs."
4,An interesting study of the sexual side of the tarot.,"There were moment when reading I had to ask, is he kidding? I know that he wasn't, though. It's an interesting viewpoint of the symbolism within the tarot cards, and how they relate to sexual matters. For more info, contact me, Gypsycaine@yahoo.com Thanks for caring enough to read my review!"
4,Essential if you really like the song or U2 instrumentals,"""The Fly"" happens to be one of my favorite songs of U2, and although I liked early-U2, I agree with the band's interpretation of this first single of the 1990s - the sound of a joshua tree being chopped down. Continuing lyrically along a theme of irony first on ""God Part II"" from 'Rattle & Hum', ""The Fly"" also has one of the best guitar solos by the Edge.""The Lounge Fly"" This is a re-mixed version of ""The Fly"" with a groovier production and a few different lyrics. If you really like the song, this would be a good addition to your collection.""Alex Descends Into Hell for a Bottle of Milk/Korova 1"". This was originally a soundtrack piece for a stage production of Clockwork Orange. As instrumentals go, this is one of U2's best, and so if you liked ""Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1"", this one is for you."
4,only 2 new tracks,"If you're a U2 fan like me, you're probably only going to buy this for Alex Descends Into Hell and the Lounge Fly mix. Both are great, but it's a judgment call whether you want to spend money on 2 tracks. I will say that Alex is one of their better Achtung B-sides, but the Lounge Fly mix sounds too much like the album version except it's a little longer. The best part is the lilting intro & outro, and I wish they'd have kept that style throughout. On its own this is a decent disc, but there are far better Achtung Baby singles you could be getting. All in all you should only get this if you are a hardcore U2 single collector."
4,heartstoppa,"this ep is as hot as a kitchen stove burner. i saw him in concert with twista at the house of blues and he stole the show. i just purchased the cd and i want everyone to know that he is the next big thing in chicago! the song ""ya ya"" puts me on charge every day. it stays in my cd changer. this is the only cd he has now, but i heard he has another one on the way and he's buzzing through the industry with contract bids. definately a classic-some of the production could be better,but he is so raw that it doesn't matter."
2,Incomplete Order,"The package arived promptly. Unfortunately it arrived too soon, aparently, as they forgot to package the extra refill and batteries (that which makes this a good deal to buy on amazon.). Hopefully they will rectify this quickly, however I got an answering machine when I called. The machine should have stated that I was calling their company so I knew I had the right number, but it only said to leave a message."
2,very scratched,should have never been resold very scratched not good enough.skips very badly no more product from you. bad site terrible
1,Not appropriate for small children,"My 3 year old loves spiderman so I bought this movie. The dialogue between Spiderman and Cat Lady has sexual undertones. I returned the movie, I would not recommend this for children."
3,Quite a tough book to enjoy it,"As a translation student I think this book is quite tough to read because it is very dense and hard to understand in some occasions. I think it's a good book in the way that it classifies translation and its varieties, but it is not the kind of book to read on holidays."
1,Where can I buy this swing?,"I cannot seem to find any seller for this item other than ebay.For those reviewers who just wrote their reviews in March 2006,where did they purchase this item?"
4,No swing is safe for 1 month old,The person from Tampa who can not read should not write reviews. No swing is safe for a 1 month or a 6 month old. The recommended age on this site says ONE YEAR. This is a good product!
4,Great Swing,"I just got this and I love it. I got it for my 11 month old twins, and after reading the bad review I wasnt sure why I got it. I am glad I did!As far as being for a 1 month old, no. The box clearly states that it is for 9 months and up.I do agree however the ropes should be a little longer,but not a bog deal. Go to the hardware store and get some chain if you want it lower. I also agree that there should be more leg room, but it is still not bad!!It is a great investment and I am sure happy I got it."
4,caterpillar swing,I looked all over for a double swing for my 15mos old twin boys in August and could only find this one at toysrus. My boys absolutely love it. I only wish I had found it when they turned one on May so I could have gotten more use out of it. The only reason why I gave it four stars is b/c it could have a little more leg room but it seems very durable and is alot of fun for twins.
5,Why we bought two!!,Most double ride swing accessories are for older kids so this caterpillar swing will give our two sets of grandkid twins ( 9 months and 20 months) a chance to enjoy the fun of swinging all at the same time safely!
5,Great for twins,"I have 6 month old twins - we got this yesterday and hooked it to their brothers' swingset. They loved being outside with the ""big kids"", I love that they look at each otheer, and are securely fastened. I agree about the shortness of the swings being awkward for adults. I also this it needs a ""drain hole"" - so far it hasn'r rained, but it appears that it will fill with water!"
3,Great idea but needs more,I bought this swing for my 7 month old and 2 year old and it's a great concept and is very durable and sturdy. There are a few problems with the leg room as there really isn't enough for 2 not even little feet and the seat belts are very small. If they could make the swing a little longer to offer better leg room and larger seat belts this would be a must have for anyone with 2 small children.
3,Close range!!,"I have this swing in my yard. My 14 month old son and 10 month old nephew use it together. This swing will not get much more use after this, since it is VERY short and the kids are leg to leg (kicking eachother and whatnot). They can reach one another and they pull the hair out of one anothers head, LOL! Another thing I did not like was the straps. They are around the legs not the waist, therefore, my 14 month old son arches his back and can actually stand up wearing the straps. DANGEROUS! It is a cute design but needs improvement."
1,not ment for long legged kids,"The old style of this product is SO much nicer!!!! This one has a floor in and if the kids are long legged they do not fit! (unless they want to have their chin to their knees.) It is also a very short lived product because of this aswell. Please bring back the old style ..... it is so much better but only older daycare providers have them.... and they don't want to give them up, as they know what a great thing they have. I would not suggest this to anyone; short life product for the money."
5,They LOVE this swing!!,"I just hung up the swing in our backyard tree, and my 11-month-old twins love it! They just sit and smile (and chew on the ropes, which are thankfully very durable!). What I really like is that I can take one out and the swing remains balanced, so the other isn't tilted too far back. It's well-made and well-designed. Definitely well worth the price."
2,Goog for mathematicians ONLY!,This is a book for those who're looking for the mathematical foundation of acoustics and vibration - purely theoretical. Avoid this book if you're looking for an engineering approach/application of acoustics and vibration. The title of the book is misleading.The book may get a 5-star rating from a theoretical mind - from an engineering mind no star ... I gave 2 stars to be nice!
2,Study Guide for use with Principle os Corporate Finance,"The summary for this book is deceiving as it does not have the solutions to the questions in the text. It has new questions and their solutions. If you are looking for the answers to all the problems in the text, get the solutions manual!"
2,"Very nice features, but value is ratio of quality and price","If you want a features list, go to the site - everything it says it can do it does, but the cost is an odd complement for the features. Is it worth the ease and intigration for the extra 900 dollars over Visual C++ 6.0? I'm not that sure, but I think you might rather take the extra hour or so to create a window with API or MFC than earn the extra money - then again, it might be because I haven't graduated highschool yet. Hopefully that will not bring up any prejudices, as I did make sure I attempted at all the options, and I must say I am happy with the product, but would I recommend paying the toll? No - although the server tools and language integration (I can now work with a friend who uses Java), the cost is very steep."
1,Price to high!,"This product is NOT so revolutionary as Microsoft tries to present. Anyway, even writing a web tools with a help of it will limit you on MS platforms..."
2,broke after a year,It was great until it quit working after about a year. It cost about $100 so obviously very disappointed that it broke so quickly. It just quit working one day for no reason.
1,It filters all words that have s sound f sound but not really bad words,"Several years ago my husband purchased this product in hopes of filtering out all of the cursing words that are being forced on people as they attempt to watch a show/move/episode. It has gotten to the point that if you have anything on tv you will have uneducated words from people that do not know other words of knowledge.The product filters words that start with the typical s, f, g, d words but unfortunately they do not stop the real words. By the time that the reasonable amount of time was given to truely evaluate the box it was too late to return for refund.My advise is to not waste your money on this device, but instead read all the reviews and know that if you see mature viewing it is full of unintellangible people reading illiterate words.Mrs Big Red"
1,good while it lasts,"Do NOT buy this. I purchased (2) of these within 2 yrs. apart and BOTH ofthem DIED for no reason approx. 18 months after use.I cleaned them regularlyusing a good dvd cleaning disk, they both just DIED after 1 yr. - 18 months.for NO apparant reason. Tried to get a refund /replacment and all i got was alame excuse to contact Memorex. I bought these directly from TV Guardian, NOTMemorex. Do not waste your money. yes, they did the job of filtering WHILE theyworked, they do just not last very long.Hope this review will help you."
1,CRUCIFY HIM!,"WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? SOME GANGSTER TURNED PASTOR, YOU ARE THE COUNTERFEIT, HOW CAN YOU TALK ABOUT PASTORS TO UNSAVED PEOPLE? GOD FORBID, YOU ARE NO GOOD WHEN YOU CALL THE HOUSE OF GOD THE PENNY TOSS MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH AND THE LATTER DAY LOST MY WAY CASINO CHURCH. I HAVE YOU TO KNOW I AM A MORMON AND I AM INSULTED, AT THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SAY THESE THINGS ABOUT DENOMINATIONS, AND I'M SURE OTHERS WILL FIND IT INSULTING TO WHEN THEY BUY THE BOOK, THIS BOOK LIKE THE APOSTOLIC ALCHOLIC CASINO CHURCH, YOU ARE CRUCIFING HIM TO THE CROSS AGAIN! I HATE YOUR BOOK, IT'S FROM THE DEVIL!"
5,Childhood optimism comes to life.,"I read this book at the preschool I work at. With beautiful illustrations and simple words, it shows the reader that one little snowflake can certainly turn into a snowstorm. The children loved it. It demonstrated the ""faith like a child"" we all wish we still had."
3,Good book too small,"Review of board book version.....While this book is wonderfully simple. It is well illustrated and is a very good book for expanding a child's imagination it is too small. It is OK if it is only one child, but if you are reading to a few children or a group it is too small. I know board books are for children to read themselves but they are getting so small that they are only good for one child at a time. The book measures 5-1/2 by 6 inches"
5,great book,Love the illustrations in this book. It was a great way to teach visual clues. The kidlets loved recreating the city
5,Beautiful illustrations!,The story in this book is wonderful. We really love the illustrations. The illustrations are the reason we bought the book.
5,Lovely story and audio version,"I am a preschool teacher and have loved reading this story to my students, especially during the first big snow of the year. The paintings are simple and interesting, as is the story itself. Audio books are great for switching things up a bit during storytime, and they are also ways for the students to experience the stories themselves at a reading center. I have found this particular story's audio reading to be very calming for my students - the reading by Sean Schemmel is very pleasant and quiet, as is the background music, complimenting the feel of softly falling snow covering the gray city in a blanket of white. A great purchase for a classroom or family library."
2,Little value for autocross drivers,"I have a feeling that this book is of little value for autocross drivers. For example, there is an advise in the book ""to follow the slalom of direct line of pylons with constant throttle application"". This is quite inefficient. What is much better upon my opinion is to release the throttle (or even press brake lightly for slow turns) on straight to transfer ahead the weight of the car, wait until the front suspension gets loaded, rotate the steering wheel to make the car enter the turn, and then apply throttle while you are unwinding the steering wheel exiting the corner. Any beginner who takes autocross courses, two hours daily, will be able to effectively apply this ""brake-steer-throttle"" technique on 5th or 10th lesson.What I recommend is ""Secrets of Solo Racing: Expert Techniques for Autocross and Time Trials"" by Henry Watts."
4,"Good, but probably dated","If you are looking for a very general idea of what these markets are like with nice pictures, then this is a good book. However I would recommend noting that the publication date was 1999, so the information in it is likely to be accurate on a macro scale only. I'm sure that there are similar vendors to those described in each market, but unlikely to be the same ones listed in here. The book does note that it is only accurate in describing fall 1998's vendors and may not be accurate at any point beyond that."
3,The Fourth Book,"I like the whole Pendragon series. All of the books are great. But this one I would have to say is my least favorite. I like the new characters like Aja and Dr. Zetlin. It's just that the whole idea of Virtual Reality seemed cool until you got into it. It seemed that when Bobby went into virtual reality the setting of it all was just a big mess from all the territories into one place. It could get really confusing at points and just sort of weird. Good book to read, but definetly not the best."
3,Headed nowhere fast,"The hype on this book is ""fast-paced action and edge of your seat danger"". That's fine, and that's what the book delivers.Here's the problem. When the fast paced action subsides, there is always an undercurrent hinting that there will be a great back-story about Halla, and who Bobby is, and what Travelers are, and so on. This hinted at, promised overarching story is probably what keeps people coming back to this series and what gets them through the increasingly frantic storylines of the individual volumes.Well, if you really like these characters or if you really like MacHale's volumes as stand-alones, good luck and good reading. If you're just toughing it out to get to the final volume payoff, you might want to consider skipping ahead a few books."
5,Pendragon: The Reality Bug,"Pendragon is about a kid named Bobby that is told he is a traveler that can travel through time and space through magical tunnels called flumes. In The Reality Bug he traveles to Veelox to help save Veelox from his enemy, Saint Dane. This book is good because it is suspence filled and always keeps you wondering what comes next. I recommend this book to kids 11 years or older because of language. This is the fourth book of the series and right now there are six out. I've read to number five and there are all very good and exciting."
3,Bugs in the Bug,"As a parent with a child who enjoys sci-fi, I tend to read these stories with them in mind. This story is 'okay' and follows in the Pendragon theme, but I'm disappointed with basic grammar and spelling errors throughout the series. If you can overlook this, I'd consider this book as light reading for a middle schooler.If you like a story with deep character development and complicated plots, you won't find it here. Although predictable, it is somewhat entertaining and creative. Most sci-fi readers will enjoy the premise, but may wish for a more in-depth exploration of this world and it's computer fantasy driven society. Also, some things aren't explained that perhaps should be... where does gloid come from?If you haven't read other books in the series, I suggest starting from the beginning. Although some things are re-explained in the course of the story, there are referrals to previous storylines."
5,Matrix type book....,"I liked this book because it had a nice twist from the other Pendragon books. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that is was a lot like the Matrix. Other than that it was well plot out and an over-all good book. To show you how good it is, it was the book that I read the fastest in my life."
4,Greatest Yet,"I have just started reading the Reality Bug and I think it is the best one in the series so far. I really like that Mark and Courtney have a bigger part in this book. I think they are a really important part of the story and I like to read about them. Plus, I think Veelox is a really cool territory and I can't wait to learn more about it. If you haven't read these books, you are missing out."
4,nice protective case,"Nice little leather case at a good price. It fits my phone snugly and does not slip around. All areas of my phone are visible, such as the keys and screen. The camera viewfinder is not obscured. I can charge my phone without removing the case. I like the fact the clip is removeable. Provides good protection and looks classy, too."
1,Power keeps resetting and alarm going off!,"This seemed to be a great buy. We got it on sale at Target for like $35. However, it had this alarm that came on by default and would start going off all the time. The terrible manual didn't tell how to get it to go off. We finally figured that out, but even with batteries in it, and plugged into a surge protector, it kept resetting itself and that alarm came on by default. We were woken up in the middle of the night and weren't too happy about walking into the kitchen to turn it off. I've never gotten any other GPX product, but don't plan to. Their web site was no help and terrible documentation that came with this product."
1,CHEAP JUNK!,"I agree 150% with Angela's review. I found the same problems, Weather alert kept going off for no reason and the unit kept resetting itself so even if you turned off the alarm it would come back on when the unit reset itself! I am STILL waiting on the UPS pick up to return the item to Amazon and it has been 3 weeks and 2 calls and numerous e-mails to Amazon. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Please don't waste your money,Fortunatly or un-f I live in St Louis where you return your defective unit to. I first purchased the KCCD300 model & it lasted 3 days. Accidently noticing that it was a St Louis address I drove downtown to their company headquarters bldg. No problem. Here is a replacement for you (an upgrade version) KCCD6815DT. Took it home installed it and that ALARM goes off and again and again. Have only played cd's twice so we'll see where that goes. FYI they are made in China shipped to St louis then redistributed nationwide. As previouse reviewers have stated-yes it is junk. Since I only paid $25.00 I'll chalk it up to buying on a whim - cheap price cheap item.
4,Great if you have firewire,"Great product, took my iPod camping for over a week and it was still going strong. Not sure why all these dummies gave it one star because they can't read the specs!!! Requires IEEE port... that is firewire!!! Oh well their loss as this is a high quality battery that I've owned for several years now and it is still going strong. You get what you pay for!"
1,Needs Improvement,"I bought one of these and returned it a couple days later (from an electronics store - much more expensive than @ Amazon). While it had many qualities I was looking for, like the thick, protected connector for the ipod instead of a dangling wire, this unit just didn't do a good job of holding a charge. I followed all the instructions, charge it overnight, etc. but still it would only give and extra hour or so battery life to my 40 gig ipod. As tempting as this one is, I'd say pass and find one with proven ability to hold a charge."
1,warning!,"I just bought one of these for my video ipod, and it is totally unusable because it uses a firewire connector for a power source. If you don't have firewire on your computer, you're out of luck. Plus how would you have access to power when you are travelling?"
1,Disappointed,"Used this item only once. It provided just what we expected, but it must have had poor wiring as it heated up when at rest with batteries in it."
3,SO SAD! Bring back the classic collection!,"I probably should not be so harsh- mercer makes GREAT knives at an amazing value. But this knife is the ""replacement"" of a much loved knife of the classic collection that was every way superior! Mercer, if you are reading this PLEASE bring back your classic set!"
3,Starts to grate as humour wears thin,"This is a well cast and well produced movie - I would not have thought it a telemovie but for Grady Harp's informative review from 2005. I think the cast works very well with what is a fairly predictable script - Lambert Wilson overplays his hand wildly, as does his dear old mum - and Adrien Aumont is just right as Dimitri - I could watch him all day.Early in the piece I thought Maitre Aumont was going to give us a taste of Gregoire Colin in Olivier Olivier - but no such luck - the movie remained fairly pedestrian. But it does have a budget, and some fine actors as well.I think this movie rates three and a half stars. No Special Features to speak of. English subtitles are good."
3,"Not excellent, but good","This live album is only good, because is a little short (PBF have so many excellent songs...i expect a much more longer live cd), and the sound isn't really good too but anyway is very enjoyable while it last, the two new studio tracks are excellent!"
5,Much less expensive than the local parts store,"I shopped the local parts stores for a hub and bearing assembly and then did a little online shopping.I selected the Timken brand from past experience and have never had a problem with this brand.The online price was 30%-50% lower than the local parts stores. As long as you have a few days, ordering online is the way to go."
1,Oversimplified approach to TRIZ,"I have studied Theory of Inventive Problem Solving with The TRIZ Experts. In few lessons they named Alla Zusman and Boris Zlotin as good TRIZ scientists, so I decided to read this book.I was totally frustrated - the book is very repetitive (the same ideas mentioned in different chapters again and again), the view on TRIZ is very naive, even results (that according to The TRIZ Experts were obtained by Zlotin and Zusman) are presented in oversimplified form. I think I wasted time and money for this book.Juj Chan Hyjun"
3,Decent Intro but...,"Systematic Innovation is a pretty good introduction to TRIZ. It's treatment of contradiction and ideality was adequate and the section of system modeling was quite good. While the chapters on problem formulation were a noble attempt they fell short of providing a roadmap to the application of TRIZ (a common failing in TRIZ books).However, I can't leave without saying that the graphics in the book are so poor as to border on the obnoxious.Matthew"
4,Systematic Innovation: An Introduction to TRIZ,"The book is really an overview of the TRIZ, it is not too academic, so it is ease to understand.Comparing with the original form of TRIZ, it shows that there are just made some adaptations to make it easier to work with it.But in some sections it could be somewhat deeper and show the way to go.I is good book that must been read with other os the same theme to give a broader view of the TRIZ."
2,Levenson book,"was very disappointed in the content....sort of an ""all about me"" book by Levenson.would not recommend or read any more of his stuff"
5,Wise Advice From Lester,"The reason there is so much suffering in the world is because of the wanting of something. That wanting has its roots in wanting to feel safe/secure, wanting control or wanting approval. It is only when you get rid of the wanting, that nagging, gnawing feeling inside that you can allow yourself to have whatever it is you want.Lester has discovered the shortcut to eliminate that feeling of lack to allow you to open up and receive what it is you desire. There is nothing wrong with having to have approval, control, or security, but it is the mere WANTING of these things that creates the attachments and aversions you have to whatever you are wanting."
4,an american spiritual masters shares what he discovered,Lester is one in a billion someone who figured out a spiritual path by himself and has laid out a practical path for everyone to tread. Here he shares his life which was ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. for anyone who needs inspiration in healing themselves. PC
4,Interfacing with iPhone,"Bought this wonderful product for my Video iPod originally. Works with iPhone but like all adapters not specifically made for it, is susceptible to the cell phone speaker interference. Note this problem can be avoided by turning the Airplane mode on, however I have found it's not any more annoying then the iPhone active and not attached to the system. Anyone who has had a ATT phone for very long knows the frustration of the cell to speaker interference problem. Additional it Powers\charges the iPod\iPhone with ignition off, it always on unlike cigarette lighter chargers. Vol is disabled on iPod\iPhone and works only on Head Unit. Minimal head unit read out. Head unit FWD/REV/PREV/NEXT work well or can be operated from iPod\iPhone directly. Supports and easily changes from Auxiliary input\iPhone\CD player."
3,USA SPEC PA11-TOY Toyota Auxiliary Input and iPod Adapter,"Ordered PA11-TOY. Merchant sent PA15-TOY with no explanation. Quite dissatisfied with PA15 as it has no mounting holes or bracket. Stupid design! CAN NOT just toss this into the inner dash & hope nothing will get damaged over time. Took me hours to come up with a good mount. Deducting two stars for this deficiency :(End result in terms of iPod interface, functionality & sound quality thru car's 6-CD stereo has been good."
3,Very odd and cheap Taiwanese Lone Wolf and Cub type movie,"Yueh Hua is basically plays a court official who decides to take revenge for a boy's father. He drags the boy around in a wooden cart and has very weird enemies. Phillip Ko plays a swordsman who has great skill and is really scary. Then this one guy shows up who uses firepalm technique or something where he throws fireballs at people. The action is never great but you will have a good time watching this movie once, though only once. I can't explain it but I don't know if I would ever watch this movie again. It is good just not great. The only reason I would watch it again is to see some really weird moments. Chen Sing is the baddie in the finale and look for Leung Kar Yan(Beardy) in a fight before that.I have the groundzero version of this. Bad picture quality but more than watchable."
1,Es una verdadera basura,"Solo puede gustarle a teeny boppers... es pésimo... empezando con el primer corte ""la vida que va"" es una pésima copia de Belive de Cher y Ray of light de Madonna.... todas las canciones se parecen, los arreglos son espantosos, nada recomendable absolutamente le falta originalidad. Quisieron hacer un cd muy grandioso pero al final es un disco del que te hartas en un ratito, las letras son asquerosas, lelas, no hay nada rescatable... mejor deberían de enclaustrarse en un estudio de grabación hasta que hagan algo relamente bueno por la música pop mexicana, pocos son los que se atreven a ser originales y Kabah no es uno de ellos. Solo compralo si el dinero te sobra y no quieres tirarlo a la basura (mejor regalalo a un limosnero).Pero no compren La Vida que va es malísimo (bueno para la gente que sabemos de música porque para los adolescentes bobitos es grandioso). Por cierto es más insufrible gracias Big Borther."
4,Where Is Maverick Square?,"Fans of Boston will love this murder mystery, set in one of America's most interesting cities. The equivocal Maverick backs his way into a mystery involving passion, jealousy & greed. The supporting characters are especially intriguing, including a French-Canadian (or is he Belgian?) with a quick, dry wit. But the most enjoyable parts in this book is how the author uncovers a side of Boston rarely seen: ominous, and twisiting, much like Victorian London. A page-turning thriller with a heart of gold, I eagerly await Maverick's return. Perhaps he will take a trip to the Midwest, and discover a mystery there, n'est pas?"
2,RUST SPOTS,"It's nice and heavy cast iron--that is a 5-star BUT it already has RUST SPOTS all over it and we've only had it three weeks. We have a new deck and I'm hoping the rust doesn't stain it! I still can't find the fine print about moisture and rust in the description. If it needs coating, why doesn't the manufacturer do that?? Can't imagine why I didn't read the reviews--I usually do. Bottom line, this umbrella base is not weather proof. For this reason---all those rust spots---I sadly have to give it 2 stars.UPDATE: I did find the warning in Product Description afterall. Too late...Purchased through Amazon."
3,Partial Stand,I had to purchase this item three time in order to get the thumb screw shown in picture. Twice they were not included.
1,"Wrong size, and Amazon ad doesn't tell you","The base doesn't fit my umbrella -- the hole is only 1-1/2"" inches in diameter. My umbrella pole is 1-7/8"". Nowhere in the Amazon ad is the pole diameter mentioned.Also, read the fine print: ""To prevent rusting, the base should be protected from constant exposure to rain and moisture."" In other words, don't use it outside."
4,Not Bad for price,BEWARE:- Very inaccurate on Carpet or other surface not Hard. But once placed on Hard Surface its accurate. Not bad for price.
2,I Dont Know??,"the pieces fell out of the bottom after two weeks. I weighted myself out at the doctors and i was 158, and this scale said i was 173. I just thought it would be a hassle to send back, so i just felt like i got ripped off a little (not trying to be a dick). Do some reserach before picking this scale."
5,TURN UP THE HEAT,This was always one of my all time favorite albums!! A truly talented band all around. Rod Temperton's writing and Johnny Wilder's vocals were a match made in heaven!
5,"""PUT THE WORD OUT!....""","that this was one of the best bands of the Disco Era. And if it weren't for the fact that the mainstream public turned on the genre starting in 1980, HEATWAVE would have been better appreciated. This is their best work. A great mix of uptempo(""Groove Line""), midtempo(""Mind Blowing Decisions"") and slow jams(""Happiness Togetherness"") that still sound great today. Johnnie Wilder's voice is soothing and Rod Temperton had a feel for the ""groove,"" that made him one of the best R&B writers/producers of the day. A GREAT CD, and a must have for anyone who loves music."
5,One Love and Marky Mark are outstanding,"I love this song. They did an excellent job of re-doing KC's song. Marky Mark is da bomb. Please release this song again. I wish they would release the other song they did together, 'Irie Vibe', that song is even better.....I'd give this song 10 stars if I could.......you gotta buy it!"
5,perfect for an extra child's bed,"so far this cot is perfect, it is for my granddaughter to use while holiday company is using her room. it arrived quickly, and is more than a fair price for it's instant setup and sturdy base. my 5 yr old granddaughter can set it up and fold it down to slide into it's storage case in the mornings all by herself."
1,Smaller than expected,I bought this for my 2 year old who is on the small side. She was too big for it and didn't find it comfortable at all to sleep in. Would be fine for outdoor use at the beach but not appropriate as a bed.
5,"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I left this at daycare. No issues at all. My baby slept fine in this cot. It's low enough that I'm not worried about him falling off.
5,great travel cot,"My son is only 17 months, so I didn't plan on having him sleep on this at night. We purchased to bring on vacation so he could nap on the beach. He loved the cot, and it was easy to transport and set up. Well worth the purchase. It's not padded, but if it were, it wouldn't fold up so well."
5,Wonderful product!,I purchased this cot for my 2 1/2 year old son for napping. We now take it with us when we travel he loves to sleep on it and its so easy to fold up & set up. Good quality for the price and handy carrying bag with fitted sheet a plus.
4,My Daughter Loves It,I bought this for my daughter so when we travel we no longer need the pack n play. As soon as I unpacked this my daughter climbed up on it. She loves sleeping on her cot.
5,Great Little Cot,Great little cot. Easy to set-up and folds small for storage. The only problem that I see with the cot is the seam that goes down the center - uncomfortable for children. This problem was easily solved. I cut a piece of egg crate mattress cover and put over cot and under sheet. From the mouth of an 8 year old - it is cozy
4,Easy to use,I ordered this because we were traveling. My 2.5 year old is a child that thrives on rigid schedules and of course that is very obvious at bedtime which he loves climbing into his bed. That said I knew he would reject a sleeping bag on the floor or going back into a pack in play for our trip.This solved the problem and he LOVED IT. Honestly I was very concerned he would reject this as a bed but it worked perfectly. We paired it with a sleeping bag and he stayed on it all night.I think this will work well for its intended use - the occasional weekend away. It was an ideal height for my short kid.
2,cot,"I would not purchase this again. It is cute and sturdy, however, there is a nylon strap down the middle going across the short way. The strap raised the middle up leaving two ""pockets"" on each end that make it impossible to lay flat without being raised up at the waist. I placed a very thick dog mattress that I purchased to use in a porta-crib on top, and it did little to alleviate the unevenness. My daughter will curl up on one end or the other. Don't waste your money. I am sure there is a better alternative."
4,My kids love it,"We have a brand new toddler bed and a new mattress in the crib, but my kids still sleep on the couch with daddy (cause daddy has a bad back and many times has to sleep on the couch for positioning support) or in the bed with mommy.We got these in order to put next to the couch and bed, and they have worked really well. My kids love them, and they are great for use when you need something that you can pick up and put away when not needed. We bought two of them, and they are great so that my wife can have the bed to herself instead of sharing it with our son. Our son can now sleep on this cot only inches from mommy, but still give mommy her space.Only thing that I do not like is that there is that bar down the middle. My kids dont seem to mind, and they seem to find this more comfortably than their mattresses, but I worry about how it will be as they get older and heavier."
4,Our Toddler Loves this Bed!,"Every since we first set up this toddler cot, our 3 year old has loved being on it! She loves to cuddle up in it at night and chill out with her blanket and doll. She also sleeps very soundly in it, and she's able to stretch out well. It will really come in handle for her grandparents' house and while traveling. It opens easily, stores easily and seems to be built well. Time will tell, but so far, we're all pleased with this cot."
4,Cot just arrived,"I ordered this to use for my 3 y/o granddaughter - it just arrived. A reviewer had written that the middle support had been changed to be fabric coated and was comfortable. However, the middle support is still pretty hard and a slightly higher than the rest of the cot on either side of it. I plan to buy an egg crate and cut it down to size and try to make it level as well as more comfortable. It did set up in seconds and stores very easily so I think for use for a night here and there it is good."
4,"Good cot, strange strap","This cot is very nice, except there is a strap right in the center that can be a bit uncomfortable if the bed isn't completely pushed down. And even then, it is right in the center of my little girls back. But, it is a nice cot. I may just get a cushion to put on top."
4,Great for a toddler,I really like the cot. I use it for a four year old. He has stood on it and it is still ok. Easy to put out and put up(almost to easy). Travel bag is wonderful. I can take the bed anywhere.
2,Bad Experience,"I bought this item last year, and it has only been used 3 or 4 times by an average 2-year old toddler. One of the legs became detached when the metal fastener broke off. This defect renders the bed unusable, and a safety hazard.Their customer service rep wisely recommended that we discontinue use, after informing me that it cannot be repaired and only has a 90-day warranty. Up until the breakage, I was pleased with the product.To be fair, their customer service rep did respond quickly to each of my email inquiries. However, the manufacturer apparently does not back up this product by providing replacement parts or services for defective merchandise.If you decide to purchase this, be aware of the 90-day warranty policy. You will be out of luck if something breaks after that time period."
4,Regalo My Cot Portable Bed is good for small children (up to 4-5 yrs maybe),It was super easy to put this together and it is lightweight. However it is not very comfortable per the kid. It would probably work for a smaller child up to 4 years old.
2,Wondering if anyone has ideas on how to fix problem,"We bought the My Cot Portable Bed but find the middle of the cot is uncomfortable because of the tight support band. Our 3 year old grandson doesn't like - and neither do we - his lower back sticking up higher than the rest of his body. The only way we can think of to fix it is to add a foam layer for both sections past the middle of the cot, which we haven't done yet. We prefer not to return the cot because we like the price, size, and weight. Does anyone have any other ideas on how to make the center of the cot level without compromising support? Thanks."
4,The kid loves it,"Very nice cot, well constructed. My son really likes it and he seems comfortable. The way that it is built leaves a little bump in the middle of the cot but overall it is very good."
4,Nicely comfortable,"I am very happy with my purchase, it sets up or packs up in a snap, no tools required. It folds down very small, comes with its own fitted sheet and carrying case, an excellent addition to our travel accessories. purchased the portable cot as an alternative to the room of my 9 year old daughter if she has a friend sleep over. She learned to set it up all by herslef. , and I liked the idea of the cot being so low to the ground for safety reasons. My daughter is a roudy little one, and I felt an inflatable mattress would not last 2 days in the same room with her. It shipped earlier than we expected and is lightweight enough for a young girl to move around and set up by herself, with supervision of course. It seems to be rather sturdy and able to take some abuse; it says not do jump on it printed right on the canvas and my son leaped onto it as soon as it was set up. She won't be able to make a habit of this, but at least it survived its first day in our house."
3,A little flimsy,"I expected this to be a bit sturdier than it actually is, so I was a little disappointed. My boys played more on these than they actually slept, so I'm not sure they're actually very comfortable. But we'll try them out some more at home and see how it goes."
4,Great for travel and when sick,"Pros: it folds up to the size of one of those chairs you see at soccer games, it's comfortable enough that my son sleeps on it when we need him to. I pull this out for travel if my son wets the bed or is sick and throws up on his bed and I don't want to keep him awake while I re-make the bed. It's also great if you're worried about having a sick kid on a nice couch.Cons: while the fitted sheet comes off to wash, the structural nylon underneath is spot clean only (not good for bed-wetters or sick kids that vomit). It's not the most stable, it's easy for my toddler to flip this if he's not behaving, but it is sturdy enough when used properly. It says right in the instructions not to jump on it or use it as a permanent bed.Overall, I recommend it, though it's not necessary unless you travel a lot."
4,Regalo Cot Bed,Purchased for my great grandson. It is a little higher off the floor than I would have liked. Also is higher in the middle than each end which might be uncomfortable. He is used to the daycare cots which are very low. . Good price-received promptly and in good condition.
3,Perfect idea bad production,I thought this product would be just perfect. I have a home daycare and purchased this item so that I could easily put the cots away and still have a clutter free home. It was great for about a week. My toddler slept on this bed one time and it broke. The product is really cute though and comes with a fitted sheet. I wish it was made a little bit better.
4,Worked Great for Trip,We brought this with us to Disney World and my 2 1/2 year old slept on it for the whole week. It is similar to her daycare nap cot. We were able to put it in the suitcase and it didnt take up a terrible amount of room...my husband was pleased with that. It is real easy to take out of its bag and set up..maybe 2 minutes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the bar in the middle is really hard and seems uncomfortable. I see why it is needed however. There needs to be some support in the structure of the cot. I put a thick blanket on the cot and then a crib sheet over that. Its worth the low cost if you plan to travel with your little one.
1,Regalo Cots and their customer service,"I purchased 2 regalo cots for my 3 year old twin grandchildren - the first one broke about a month after I bought it; the second one just broke (about 6 months after). After the first one broke I contacted the company because before I bought it people who had reviewed the cots said the corner brackets break but they had good luck in getting new ones from the company. Well, I didn't. They wanted my item numbers and sales slip and all sorts of info that I didn't have so now I have 2 cots that I need to throw out because it was so hard to get the replacement parts. The cots are great when not broken but what good are they if they break and can't be repaired?"
2,Not constructed to lay flat!!,"The concept of this portable, fold up and very convenient toddler cot/bed is brilliant that is short lived when you realize while prepping it for your child, the way it's constructed when it's spread out? the very middle of this bed is raised up so your child can't lay-sleep comfortably flat?! my child has to curl up of simply lay uncomfortable! this product is not made to lay down & sleep rather for a sitting down either on the left or right!"
5,Good,Ups came right after my son fell asleep. Opened the box and tested it with him. Stayed asleep. Did not seem to notice. Quality seems good. He woke up and jumped on it. He weighs 30 pounds and it held up.
3,SLOWEST DELIVERY YET! Love the cot - hate how long it took!!!,"SLOWEST DELIVERY YET! Love the cot, but hate how long it took!... I am VERY glad that I ordered this cot WAY IN ADVANCE! Because, it took a month and a half for it to FINALLY get here. Nothing else, that I have ordered through Amazon, has taken this long. Now I notice that there is a note (that wasn't there before) saying, ""ships within 4 to 6 weeks"". As for the cot, my 2 year old daughter LOVES it, and so do I! I would give an ""excellent"" (5 stars), but because it took so very long, that is why I only gave ""fair"" (3 stars). It IS a FABULOUS travel toddler bed; it is easily portable, very compact, a breeze to set up, seams comfortable for my daughter, and ultimately I am VERY pleased with this cot... I would (and have) recommend it to others."
3,Kids love it.,"Bought one of these several years ago. Great size and height. I tried laying on it and didn't find comfortable but granddaughter liked it. That's all that counts. Purchased another a month go. Do not believe the height or length. The cot now measures 12 inches high and about 3 inches shorter than stated. Was disappointed cuz we wanted matching cots, but after much investigation, i found they no longer make the cot with the dimensions as listed, but are using the old box and dimensions. Amazon was very helpful and understanding with all this. Would have rated cot higher if the dimensions were accurate."
1,Not pleased,"The fabric strap thru the middle elevates the middle right where your child's back is dropping the sides around it. He doesn't mind sitting on either side, but can't lay on it. He's two, so it's not his weight."
5,Great!!,"It is a very great deal! For $25 I have a bed for my girls anywhere! It is very light, small when fold and comfortable even for my 7 year old girl! I really recommend this for families that like to travel with little kids!"
3,Ok but not the most comfortable,"The size is great for traveling, easy to pack in a suitcase! The only negative is the strap in the middle underneath the ""mattress."" It seems to make a high point in the middle where my son lays. His head and feet are lower than his stomach or back. I ended up putting pillows and blankets underneath to try to level it out."
3,It works but it's not great,"This cot is nicely compact for travel and will work well for sleepovers for our toddler at Grandma's or Auntie's house, however the support strap that runs between the middle legs across the underside of the cot creates a ridge which reminds me of sleeping on a hide-a-bed/pull out couch - you know that metal bar in the middle of your back? Well I am going to have our toddler try to sleep on it and see if he can tolerate otherwise we might be sending this one back."
2,support strap in the middle uncomfortable,"While we really liked this product for it's easy fold up and light weight, the strap that supports the middle is too tight and makes lying down on it uncomfortable. We will be replacing it. Mostly it's best for sitting on, side by side with someone."
1,Awful,"We purchased this bed for our 2 year daughter because we do travel several times a year and she no longer will sleep in her pack-n-play. The bed set-up quickly, however there is a thick band in the center similiar to the support bar on pull-out couch bed. My daugher was very uncomfortable and said that it hurt her belly and back. She ended up sleeping with us. It is a good concept by the design for comfort is lacking."
1,Regalo Cot,I was very disappointed with the bed. We ordered the bed for a vacation and unfortunately did not open the package until we arrived at our destination. The bed was broken so we had no bed the first night for my son to sleep in. Not sure if the bed was damaged in shipping or if it was manufactured incorrectly either way we were disappointed.
2,"Functional, but uncomforatable...","The cot serves its function (allowing my 4-yr-old daughter a place to bunk out in mom and dad's room if she gets scared), but it is not comfortable. She's a tiny little thing (so it's not a weight/size issue) and she told me after about 20 minutes in it on the first night that her hips hurt her. There's a strap that goes through the center that allows both ends to slightly sag while keeping the center tight. We put two bed pillows on top of the cot to smooth it out for her and it has been working out ok. Disappointed though..."
1,no good,There is a strap kind of thing right in the middle of the cot that is higher than either end. It's very uncomfortable for my toddler. We returned it.
3,Cot not Comfortable,"I was disappointed in the function of the cot. The center portion is tighter and higher than the rest. As a result, you lie on a hump. The way it folds up is great and the size is nice for a toddler bed that you can put down and take up quickly. I had bought it for my 2 year old grandchild, but she couldn't lie on it without it being uneven, so I returned it."
2,Not comfortable,"While my daughter sometimes likes to play with this by climbing all over it, the bar in the bed makes it way too uncomfortable to really use to sleep on. There is no way she would sleep on this. We are now going to but an inflatable air mattress for her. I wish we had returned this."
2,Not really what I was expecting,"I bought this with the intent to have something for my son to sleep on when we go out of town. Something that would pack easily and not take up tons of room on the floor. While the cot is small and definitely not cumbersome, it's not a good enough quality for my son to sleep on all night. The middle sagged and didn't offer the kind of support that would be comfortable all night. My son is average sized and had to roll off the cot. I just didn't like it, and have since returned the cot and bought an air mattress."
1,Extremely Cheap,"I understand you get what you pay for, but this is ridiculous. I ordered this item for my daughter for our upcoming camping trip, and twice, it was broken when I received it. I am very unhappy with this item as it was not padded, as it looked, as well as it's broken middle edges that are clearly not supposed to be that way. I will not be ordering from Regalo again."
5,Blue Portable Cot,Service was great. The cot is well worth the money spent. My grandson loves it. Best buy I have made in a long time.
2,I am sending it back.,The cot is a great size for a toddler except it has a cross-strap dead center of the cot and the strap is higher than the rest of the cot. My granddaughter could not even sleep on it. She would have had her back up in the air higher than her legs and head.
4,Great Value and Price - Minimal Complaints,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for those nights that she needs to sleep in my room. Overall I am pretty impressed with the product. It is a little higher off the ground than I was expecting but not too high that if she were to roll off she would get hurt. She hasn't had any complaints about it and loves having her own ""bed"" in mommy's room.I love how easy it is to fold up and it collapses small enough that I can keep it in the corner and not even notice it! It is going to be great for our vacations and traveling!My only complaint is that it has a pretty significant dip on either side...it is not very comfortable looking and actually puts the childs head on a more downward angle. I fixed it by putting foam under the cover to even it out on one side...that way there is not downward angle and is more like sleeping on an actual bed. After the ""fix"" I really like it and think it is, overall, a really good product for a great price!"
5,Love it,Excellent product. Sets up in seconds. My son slept well in it. I plan to buy it for my other son when he gets to be of age
2,Ok for sitting on - not sleeping on.,"These cots have a strap sewn into the middle that doesn't stretch enough to make the cot perfectly flat to lay on. Maybe if someone was heavy enough it would stretch, but my son is as tall as the cot is and he didn't weigh enough to sleep flat. We ended up using a blow up bed for sleep and will be returning them. The picture of the 2 kids sitting at the beach is probably more what is intended for this product. Sitting, not really sleeping."
4,Perfect for Our 2 Year-Old Grandson,"This is great for little ones. It will probably last until our grandson is 4, when I predict he will outgrow it."
4,My Cot Bed,"I liked this very much. Works very well in limited space and stores nicely. Unfortunately, I thought my grandson was old enough to stay on it, and go to sleep. I don't recommend this for a child who still needs confining. Get a crib or playpen instead."
4,Nice little kids cot,We got this cot for our granddaughter. Construction seems good. Very compact for storage. Easy to set up and break down.
1,Skip it,"This cot is flimsy and doesn't hold a small 2 year old. It came apart within the first handful of uses. We were able to finagle it back together with the help of some plastic ties but it still didn't get used much. It was at grandmas house or sleepovers and couldn't hold up to the challenge. Not worth your money, skip it!"
4,"smells terrible, wash before use","This cute cot arrived quickly, and seems very sturdy. However, it smelled to high heaven of a chemical when I opened the box. So bad that I had to put it outside until I had time to wash it. I washed the cot, the cover and sheet in hot soapy water, rinsed it and dried it in the sun. Luckily the smell went away. So don't wait until the last minute to use this cot, wash it first. It will be so much easier than dragging a twin mattress up from the basement, and warmer than a blanket on the floor."
4,Sleeps well,I am very satisfied with this cot for my 2 sons my youngest is 19mons about 24lbs and my oldest son 8yrs old about 53lbs can sleep well in it not together but they have sat on it together and no problems It folds up very easy and I am able to carry it where ever I need to go. The only thing is I needed it to be more softer but once you add a lite child comforter to it.It works fine for cushion. I am very happy I brought this product :)
5,Road Trip wonder,"For the small car owner with kids there is very little as intimidating as the pack and play. For years I had to avoid it and either get the hotel crib or the family one bought by relatives for when we arrived. Not this year. I took my cot to Florida and had room to spare.Assembly: None.Setup: VERY simply. Just pull apart the beams and there you have it. I did add more padding under the sheet via another blanket.Comfort: My three year old took to it right at bedtime, no complaints, not even on the first time.Space: Folds relatively small, didn't take up massive space in my hatchback. Also lightweight to carry.Glad I purchased this."
5,Easy to use,"I have used this several times since I purchased it for my two year old grandson. Except for a center strap that bothers me but not him, I have no complaints about this item. It sets up easily---he can open & close it independently. The mattress cover that comes with it washes well and retains its' fit. Great quality and price."
2,Disappointed,"there is a strap in the middle of the cot which makes it uneven to sleep on, also causes a bad alignment to the back. Extremely disappointed, and it was not mentioned in the product description."
2,Uncomfortable for 2 year old,"We took this cot on vacation with us, and my 2 year old slept on it fitfully each night for a week. I don't think he was comfortable - I know I wouldn't be with a big strap/lump running right through the middle of the cot. He didn't sleep, so nobody slept. It made for a very difficult vacation. I may use it for sitting on the sidelines at games, like the pictures suggest, but we won't be using it for sleep again."
2,Customer Service reps for this company are rude!,"A friend of mine ordered this cot for her 3-year old and seeing how well it worked out for the little one, I decided to get a portable cot for my 1-year old, solely for sleepover purposes. Well, I never received my product, although I do not hold the company totally accountable as the error was due to the incompetence of UPS. However, I contacted this company twice; the first time to get delivery information and the rep never called me back and the second time, the representative was just plain rude. I believe the product is good, but this seller should remind their representatives about the importance of good customer service."
2,Support strap down middle is uncomfortable!,"I was optimistic when I opened this cot, as we had borrowed another kid cot in the past. Unfortunately the support strap that ran perpindicular across the center of the cot makes it unusable. The cot sags on either side of the strap and it is just sitting there all stiff in the middle. I'm returning it."
1,MyCot Review,This cot is tighter in the middle than on either end; it should have the same tautness from end to end.
2,OK,"great size but it doesn't lay totally flat like the picture. the middle of the cot sticks up and there is a hump in the middle of the cot. the legs don't ""lock"" into place to keep the cot a flat. we have to put blankets on both sides to ""build"" up a flat surface then put a sheet over them for our grandson to lay on."
3,good cot but...,"I purchased this cot for my 3 year old. We used it once while staying in a hotel adn he liked it a lot, but he is very tall for 3yrs old and even laying on his side with his feet pulled up a little, I could see it wouldn't be long before he'd completely outgrown it. I think it's a nice cot, the set up and collapsing is quite simple and it comes with a handy carry around bag. I would recommend it if your 3 yr old is not as tall as a 5 year old."
1,This cot is DANGEROUS!,"I picked this up today and it is already on it's way back. Worse than the raised ""bar"" in the middle is the fact that the cross bars all the way around the darn thing are a serious finger pinching hazard. I cannot believe the pain I experienced when MY finger got caught....and it would have BROKEN a small child's fingers for sure. I shuddered when my one year old crawled up on the cot & reached over the edge. I do not even want this thing in my house...there is no way to guarantee it won't seriously hurt little ones....it got me!"
1,Not made for sleeping,"We were really excited to get this cot for our toddler, and we set it up as soon as we got it. Unfortunately, it has a strap right in the middle of the cot so that our toddler's torso is up high while his head and feet are much lower. It looks very uncomfortable and I don't expect our toddler to be able to sleep like that.Very poor engineering, who can sleep with a ""bar"" right in the middle of their body. We are returning it."
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,I purchased this bed for my 2 1/2 year old son who weighs 38lbs and within 1 night the corner came apart. I was able to screw the screw back on but very displeased to see how quickly it came off.
2,too small,"I had a similar cot by another company that I love for my 2 and 3 year olds, and wanted another one. This one is WAY smaller than it says. My 2 year old could not comfortably fit- and my 3 year old's feet were hanging off the end. The child in the picture must be scrunched up into a tiny ball under that picture!"
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I purchased the Regalo My Cot online for my 2 year old granddaughter. When the cot was opened up, it seemed to have two sides because there was a tight strap going across the middle of the cot, the short way. I called the company and they sent me a new one right away. Unfortunately the new one is much the same. Too bad."
3,"Decent, Not Great","Pros:Good size for toddlers, Lightweight, Seems sturdyCons:Has a band that stretches across the middle that makes sleeping on it uncomfortable (according to my son). Plan on using a camping mat, piece of foam cushion, etc. so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sofa bed where the bar cuts into your back."
1,no good!!!!,"This cot is no good!!!! My poor child, said that she hated it. The cot has a bar in the middle and that is all she can feel. I even put extra padding in that area and it did nothing for it. I mean come on now who would make any type of bed with a big old bar going right across your back! What a waste of money!!!!"
2,Childs sleeping cot,"Loved it till my son laid on it and the huge bar in the middle was very uncomfortable. None of the reviews I read before purchasing mentioned it. It's a very nifty cot, but if my son can't sleep on it without back pain the next morning then what's the point. I guess for only $29.99 I figured something had to be off since most cots started around $70.00."
3,"Its OK, BUT!","It is a nice lightweight travel bed for toddlers, its quick to open and make their beds... BUT:The Frame of the bed hurts them, it is a normal stretcher with an extra removable ""sheet"" there is NO mattress to protect their bodys from the frame at the bottom. This is causing discomfort and pain after a nights rest on it. My 3year old woke up in the middle of the night complaining about pain and she tried to move off the bed away from the frame area.My advice would be if you are interested in this product to not let the child sleep directly on the stretcher but to double fold a duvet and let them sleep on that (you can even place the double folded duvet under the removeable sheet for extra comfort) and then under their blanket...Other than this discomfort the frame is causing, it can work for a nice product."
5,LOVE IT!,"We use this beside our bed for whatever kids has a nightmare/hears a bug/ hears a ghost/has a bad feeling/just doesn't want to be alone. With 5 boys, it gets use almost every night and has stood up to their abuse and they say it's comfy. Good buy!"
3,regalo cot,"I had purchased the princess play hut cot a couple of years ago (I had seen some of the bad reviews for it, but purchased it anyways). it was good, but I had a 10 year old decide to jump on it and broke it... This time i decided to go with the Regalo, since it had better reviews. After receiving it, I see that it is significantly smaller (shorter) than the play hut cot. also, someone had said the play hut was uncomfortable because of the cross stitch pattern that goes across it (the play hut one) However the Regalo, across the middle, sits on the medal frame... which can be felt and seems a lot more uncomfortable than the cross stitch pattern on the play hut. I am not looking for an extravagantly comfortable cot... just one that doesn't dig into my 3 year old's hip when we are staying away from home. I prefer the Play hut cot over this Regalo. again, it was longer, and you can't feel the medal frame... My daughter? she hasn't complained about either one, she sleeps soundly on both."
2,"Works for extremely ""occassional"" use....","We bought this cot for a short trip to the beach to use in place of a pack n' play for our 2 yo. The manual showed two ""anchor"" pieces that were not included in the box...The cot does not stay ""tight"" for sleeping, and there's a bump on either side because of this. I was concerned that it would keep my son from sleeping soundly and comfortably. I emailed the company to ask for those parts that were missing. I was informed that the pieces are discontinued from the design for over a year now and shouldn't be needed for use. The manual obviously needs to be updated!Anyway, we will use this for very very occasional use since it isn't the sturdiest thing and isn't very comfortable for sleeping."
3,Not a good buy.,"We purchased this cot for a upcoming getaway for our 3 year old. Took it out of the box and the button that screws the top material to the frame was already broken. Spoke to the company directly and even though they were aware of the problem I was told the replacement parts would come the next week. They still haven't shown up, so I called again. This time a very unpleasant person took my call and said that they just mailed the parts today (a week later). Now we are unable to use this cot for our getaway. You would think that if the company is aware they would put a rush on trying to make the customer happy. Was so hoping this would be a great fix for sleeping in hotels. Very bummed."
3,okay for the price,"The cot is nice and compact, great for travel. It has a support strap sewn through the center of the cot that does not give as much as the surrounding fabric so there is a rise in the middle of it that didn't look comfortable."
3,baby cot,This is okay. It is not really a cot to sleep on. It is really a cot to keep you child off the sand or ground for a few moments of quiet time.
2,Stretched/Sagging Fabric,"The fabric for this cot stretched not long after we got it and became uncomfortable for our child (now 3) to sleep in. There is a frame that traverses the middle of the cot, effectively dividing the cot.We bought it over a year ago. For a while we worked around the stretching/sagging with a pillow over the frame in the middle, but that doesn't work anymore.It's only been used maybe 1-2 times a month, plus a 1 week vacation last year.We're looking for a replacement."
2,"SO SO, will do in a pinch",The center support strap caused discomfort. It didn't relax when you layed on it causing your mid section to be elevated while your hips and shoulders sank down. My son says it hurts his back.
3,Not so sure it's worth it,"I got this for occasional use (sleep overs, trips etc.). It is true what others say, about the support section in the middle, which is raised. This can't be comfortable! I wanted something easier to haul around than a pack'n'play. I would say you have to put some folded blankets on each half, that way it evens out with the middle. It's a great idea, but not well thought-out. I won't return it, just because I'll use it may be twice a year, but if I was to use it regularly...definately I'd return!"
1,Uncomfortable BUT portable,"We were able to fit this inside a carseat bag (WITH the carseat) when flying to the beach. It is very portable and not heavy. BUT, it's horribly constructed. There is one strap that goes underneath the cot that serves as the brace in the middle to keep the pad up. All it does it create two holes on the top and bottom side, and cuts into the waist of your child. I tried evening it out by piling blankets on top, but it still doesn't work. I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Great item for the kids,"This is a great item but the bag that it comes with has no handle to carry and the plastic piece to pull the cord broke in half the first time using. Must of been cracked before I used, broke very easy. I would buy this again just wish it had a handle to make it easy to carry. I bought 4 and the kids love them. Good luck."
2,Falls apart,I love the idea of these but they keep falling apart. I bought 6 total because my original 2 fell apart so often that I wanted to replace them but those fell apart too. My kids are no more than 30 lbs using them.
2,toddler,"Read carefully...these are for TODDLERS and are smaller than I expected. I bought six for my grandchildren, who are ages 3-5 but I really believe they are too small for them."
1,Very uncomfortable,Bought this bed for a 3 year old to sleep on while she visits with her family. On the first night she could not sleep on it because it was so uncomfortable. She was more comfortable sleeping on a blanket laid out on the floor! The bed has a support seam that runs from side to side half way down the bed that makes it uncomfortable and unusable.
5,Great Little Camping Cot,"This is a great little camping cot -- seems well-made and it's a great size (i.e. small enough that it doesn't take up too much space in the tent, large enough for my three-year old's comfort). I suspect it'll still be in great shape when the kids outgrow it and we can sell it on Craigslist!"
5,PORTABLE COT,THIS COT IS SO CONVENIENT!!!! IT OPENS UP AND CLOSES VERY EASILY AND WELL WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF KNEELING ON IT AND BROKE IT. SO ADHERE TO THE WEIGHT LIMITGREAT PRODUCT
1,Picture of this bed is deceiving!!!,"I had the perception that this cot had a soft type matress as the sleeping surface. It does not! The center pulls up so it is extremely uncomfortable and wavy. I purchased for a day bed for children, and have to put layers of sleeping bags on top to make it suitable to take a nap on. Very disappointed. They really need to invent a small tramp just like this...that seems to be the only thing the children want to do with it.... as it is...."
5,Love this cot!,"We purchased this for a roadtrip to grandma's house. Our very tall, skinny preschooler loved it. He props it up in his bedroom when he's pretending to be out camping. The sheet is easy to take off and put on. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up to a 45lb kid jumping into it (instead of laying down for sleep)."
2,Sort of works,"I bought three of these cots for my grandchildren. I intended to use them for the under 4 yr. olds. They did work, but please note that the weight of an average 3 yr. old causes the sling-type sleeping area to almost hit the ground. One of the leg frames broke, and for the most part the kids only found them comfortable when padded with a thick comforter. Also, sleeping on this for more then a few days was not as comfortable as one would want it to be. All in all not the best purchase."
3,Great Cot but falls apart over and over,"I've had this cot for a year now and have been using it with a 3 year old that I babysit. It is a wonderful cot. I love how easy it is to store and set up. When the child lays in this it sinks in the center like a hammock preventing them from rolling out. My toddler has never complained about the center bar.Now for the bad, the bed is held onto the frame with a plastic plug and a screw. These fall out ALL THE TIME. I've lost two of the screws now and have not been able to find replacements (there are a specialty item and cant be found in the hardware store.) I've contacted the company by email with no response. I'm currently holding it together with zip ties. This is a shame, because I love this bed and so does the toddler! He's almost out grown it height wise (he is very tall for his age) so I'm just going to deal with it for a few more months before looking for something else. If Regalo would fix the plug/screw issue I would give this 5 stars."
5,Four year old loves,We use this when we go camping.My four year old fell right to sleep despite the usual noise of other campers.Set up and break down are simple.
3,Portable Cot,"The portable cot was priced nice, but I wasn't exactly crazy with the cot its self. There is a support band that runs right through the center of the cot, which makes the center of the cot tight and the two ends sitting lower than the center. I had to place a queen size folded up comforter on top of the cot and then place a sheet over the comforter to make the cot comfortable enough for my daughter to sleep on the cot."
5,i use it for everything,I use this as a cot mostly. My baby stays at her babysitter all day and this is a great item were she can take everywhere she goes. Specially because she lives in a town home is light weight and she can set it up anywhere she wants to
2,Regalo Cot,Its not comfortable to sleep on.Hurts my childrens back.The cot is to short to be called a toddlers bed.
2,it is not comfortable...,This cot seemed like the perfect solution for taking my 4 year old grandson on trips but he couldn't sleep on it and ended up sleeping with me anyway. I should have heeded the other reviews.
2,Not good for sleeping!!!,"This cot arrived after a lot of expectations.. The moment I unfolded it, the middle portion of the cot caught my attention. It had a bump in the middle and would definitely be very uncomfortable for a child to sleep in it. I tried to put a cushion on one end and made my son lay down on it as a trial, but still he was uncomfortable in the middle raised area. Not good!! Definitely not for sleeping!!! But it was great for my son to sit on it!! Im sure it would be great to use on the beach or park for kids to sit on it, but not for sleeping. I returned it!! My main objective of buying it was to use it as a travel cot which will never happen.. Dont give your child a backache by making him/her sleep in it. If the manufacturer would fix this problem, I will surely buy it again."
3,"Ok, but...","Sinks in way too much. My children look uncomfortable on the cots, but they love them. I guess because it's something different from the beds they sleep in every night. I just wished it didn't sink in where the bars aren't supporting it."
1,Terrible Design,"It is lightweight and compact. However, there is one primary center support that runs the width. It is very taught and tighter than the areas at either end. As a result, it creates a bar that the child's back wraps over leaving their head and butt in the saggy parts at either end. I am so surprised that parents rated this so highly. Would you really be comfortable in something that does not offer consistent support the entire length of the cot? I saw one review where there used to be a bard in the same center location that was replaced... but the replacement doesn't address the bend in the cot part. I am returning it and made the decision within a few minutes of opening the product. Too bad as it would have been perfect as the better cots are 3x the cost. Guess it doesn't pay to cut corners. I am going to try the Go-Kot."
4,Good for the price,"We used this cot for a camping trip and we keep it in the trunk of the car for when we visit relatives. When our son is tired, we just take it out and set it up for him to sleep on. It keeps him OFF of the floor and he says it's comfy to sleep on. I do not think this would be an item you'd want a child to jump on. Not sturdy enough for that. The weight has to be somewhat evenly distributed to avoid folding up. Pretty convenient."
3,Marginally dangerous?,"I'm giving this a three out of five because I haven't really made my mind up about it. For the few short months it lasted, it was my daughter's favorite thing. She watched TV in it, took an occasional nap on it, colored in her coloring books, etc. The other day, however, she was standing on it, and it broke. One of the plugs in the corner just popped right out and she fell. She didn't get hurt, but I surmise she could have had she been a hair closer to the TV stand. She weighs about 30 pounds (standing or sitting, I think, though I'm no physicist) so she isn't over the weight limit for this product. I really did like this little unit. Portability definitely trumped the playpen. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Ordered 2 both broken same area.,I don't write a lot of reviews actually I think this might be my first. I ordered to of these cots for my 3 year olds. I took the first out of the package and right away I noticed that the middle piece holding the fabric was broken (Held via a plastic piece and screw) I thought oh well I will just send it back because Amazon is amazing like that :). Then I opened the second one and setup it up (Very easy) as he laid on it the middle piece broke (Same exact area on the first one I opened) he slammed his shoulder on the cross bar and was in pan for a few seconds. I sent these back - maybe they had a bad batch of them. The reviews were great. Sorry guys not a gambling man. I gave it a 2 because of ease of setup.
2,Believe the negative reviews on this one,I doubted the reviews that warned of the center strap. The reinforcement in the center of this cot cut dead center across my one year old's back so that her head hung back. It looked so ridiculously uncomfortable there was no way she could sleep on it. Very disappointed.
1,Unfortunate,"We ordered 2 of these for an upcoming camping trip. The first of the cots arrived broken. Both fasteners for the middle supports were cracked off. The second cot was in fine shape, but the support running across the length of the cot was immediately uncomfortable for our son. I'm in the process of returning both cots and we have already purchased a replacement cot that our son enjoys."
3,Kids & Cots,"This idea is a great one but is underdeveloped. The convenience of a fold away accomodation for grandkids is fine, but this cot is under padded and lacks the strength to withstand kids natural instincts to play in their beds. Therefore, I would recommend to the manufacturer that they raise the price to $100 and provide a much stronger wider version and some egg crate foam to make it soft. We supplied our own egg crate foam for less than 10 dollars under the fitted sheet, but could do nothing about the lack of strength in the structure.Raise the quality and I would give this five stars. As it is,three is the best I can give.WCW"
4,Waterfowl Painting: Blue Ribbon Techniques,"An excellent book for anyone interested in the art of waterfowl painting. Great detail pictures will help you get a true-to-life look. The love of waterfowling extends thoughout the entire Veasey family and continues today with Bill's son Michael Veasey and his wife Susan. Michael, a third generation carver, continues to produce the award winning work passed down from his father. ...."
5,Waterfowl Painting,I am new to waterfowl painting and found this book very helpful to a beginner. It was written in an easy to follow manner that made sense. I have experminted with suggested processes and found them extremely helpful as I improve my techniques for painting. I recommend the book as an excellent resource book for anyone painting waterfowl.
4,Hell is a nice place to visit?,"This movie has it all action,adventure,romance,comedy& the DEVIL.Watched 20 years ago finally found a copy(dvd no less) on amazon site.Really enjoyed it again.But it,watch it,love it."
4,"video quality okay, packaging great","I saw this video waaaay back in the day when it first came out. Don't quote me, but I believe it came out on H.B.O. sometime in the eighties. Funny, I don't remember it being that corny. But it was fun to see it again. Don't get me wrong, corny is good sometimes...Oh! And would you like to see Johnny Knoxville on his first acting gigg? He's the guy outside Hell's Dinner cooking eggs on the sidewalk! Wow, he must have been an extra at the time, way before the Dumb Ass movies! But let me say something about the company that sent the video; the tape and packaging looked like new...Audio was a little down by today's standards. But, in all, I had a ball watching this oldie!"
3,I couldn't help but enjoy it.,"Okay, so this movie sucks. However, there was something about this film which made me enjoy it... and don't ask me what, because the movie wasn't funny or scary.. although Ben & Jerry Stiller's cameos were kinda funny.Anyway.. don't expect much from this film.. but you'll probably still enjoy it.By the way... Hellcop kinda reminded me of Scarman from the movie ""Cut"" (I don't know why I'm telling you this)."
3,Glorified Coloring Book,"What I didn't get from the description is that this book seems geared to young children, probably 9 and younger (9 being Flansburg's magic number).It is basically pages and pages of Flansburg's number grid, and the exercises involve using colored pencils or pens to shade the numbers that answer the exercise question. The premise is that doing this will make you familiar with patterns on the grid that will be helpful in doing mental calculations.Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. To an adult, coloring in number shapes over and over would be laboriously dull. And I can't really see a computer-savy kid with a short attention span spending much time on it.Here is what I recommend to Flansburg instead: Team up with a software developer to create a computer animated flash card type of self-training system. Make it something that a six year old can start with, but with advanced training that adults can jump into."
5,underrrrated,"like silver scooter before them, emotional power pop bands dont get their credit. If your into your taking back sundays or saddle creek bands.this is a band that should be checked outplus go on http://www.jupither.com/index.php?song=Funky%202005 to hear their re-make of funky"
5,A trip into an emotional spill over,"I bought this album by looking in a crank record advertisment and found it with many other good records. This album never lets you know how emotional its going to get, with slow meaningful lyrics then making your heart stop with heavy waves of chaotic bliss. Though there are not many songs each one affected me differently. I would list this band with others such as Mineral, Hum, Sunny Day Real Estate and Neva Dinova. This album is a true trip that made me want to get up and shout or shed a bloody tear to my thoughts. Emo you have no idea about Jupither! BUY BUY BUY"
3,Snake is okay,"I purchased the snake not as a toy, rather for my garden. It does look pretty real except for the seam that runs lateral to its body. The head looks real and the body would be realistic if were not for the seam.One person that was looking at my garden was frightened when she saw the snake.I also have an Owl and the motion detecting Scarecrow to keep birds out. Between all of them it seems to be working."
4,An Authoritive Work,"A light and interesting read on a people group about whom no other author has published as best as I am aware.This contains curious information of people who observe certain ancient food laws and the seventh-day Sabbath, although not as other religious groups do (eg the priest's wife cooks on the Sabbath). It is questionable whether this is due to the influence of ancient Judaism during or since King Soloman's time or a result of traditions received from their own ancestors.Unfortunately, this people group is shrinking and may not even exist today considering when the book was published. Does anyone know if they still exist?"
1,War,"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.--John Stewart Mill--"
3,Making School Inclusion Work,"At this point the book is getting old. There is a lot of new material out there to write regarding inclusion---I should know since I wrote this book. In addition we, the authors did not write or believe in the last chapter of the book. The publisher wrote it---they are his opinions. Only a few main concepts are ours. And finally while I do believe that the inclusion of children with special needs is very important---we have learned alot since 1994 and have additional thoughts and opinions, as well as techniques We would also love it if Brookline Books would pay us for the last 4 years of sales--that would be very nice of Mr. Budolff. In closing please feel free at anytime to get in touch with us a Kids Are People School to learn more about our updated philosophies."
1,"CD Does not Load, Jump Thru Hoops For Rebate","I bought my VS7 Professional Upgrade (06/02) and have encountered 2 major problems.First the CD's do not install. There is a grinding noise in my CD-ROM. Evidently other purchasers are experiencing the same problems. THe PC and CD-ROM which I own is the latest from DELL purchased in the last month. All other CD's load fine.Second, in order to get the rebate...from Microsft, you need to send in a proof of purchase from one of the previous versions of Microsoft products. THe proof of purchase is the product box top with the product name and bar code clearly identified"
3,Not as good as eclipse,"Up until a year ago I think I would have been praising Microsoft for yet another great product...then IBM release eclipse 2.0, and everything changed. Eclipse has an amazingly solid interface, great version control integration, and incredible ease of use. And... oh by the way, tons of features you don't find in VS.NET, like code formatting/ beautifying (no I'm not talking about changing the font), easy file manipulations, *real* pre-compile time code checking, and did I mention it was free and can be run in both Windows and Linux? Ahh... so you say I'm not a java programmer, eclipse is useless to me....WRONG!!! A Project is already underway to add .NET support, specifically C#.Head to head eclipse is hands down the clear winner, but hey I suggest you draw your own opinions. Download eclipse and see for yourself."
1,Prepare for a Nightmare,"I have installed the Visual Studio .NET without any errors, but the development environment will not start. I have tried the installation, reinstallation on Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home, Windows 2000 Professional. The development environment will not start in ANY of the environments. All I get is the following error appears: ""The application cannot start.""I have followed all of the instructions in the Microsoft support article ""PRB:Visual Studio .NET IDE Does Not Open When Started (Q306905). None of the fixes suggested work.To make matters worse, I spent 3 weeks waiting for Microsoft to send me replacement CD's because the original software package was missing CD #3. Then, I was sent the wrong version of Visual Studio. I finally get the correct version, now thegarbage will not start. This is REALLY too much!My only hope is that this type of poor quality will finally bring Microsoft down and bankrupt the arrogant little Mr. Gates."
4,Impressed with .Net,"I purchased VS.Net last month, got it installed with no problems. I really enjoy the improvements made to the IDE, especially the way the different toolboxes are set up. I read the first review on ""Rebate Gotcha"" and I did some additional research. I went to the MS web site for VS.Net and got the telephone number to the rebate center. I called and verify that IN ADDITION TO the top box (which most people don't keep), they will accept the back of the VS 6 or other qualifying product CD case (the one with the CD Key), or the original title page of the manual of the qualifying product. I got my refund today, in less than 30 days."
3,"Good for web, weak on native C++","This edition of Visual Studio is geared heavily towards web and .NET development. If you're still a native C++ programmer, the interface is going to feel clunky and project management (adding / removing configurations, the build process) can be a nightmare. The debugger is great, the compiler has improved, and the new runtime code checks are fantastic. They just need to work on the UI for non-.NET developers."
1,What a pain to install,"After 2 days I finally got a working if limited install of this program that did not crash when launching. Leave it to Microsoft to create a product that does not work with certain DVDs and CD-ROMs. Their response is to xcopy the cds to your hard drive. (Hope you got 2G of space) Still did not fully work.Of course it could be the disks themselves are corrupt. Guess I still got a few more days of work ahead of me. Before you buy check the newsgroups to make sure you got a compatable drive, pioneer dvds are a known problem."
2,Everlasting? I don't know about that!,"One of my dogs (8 lbs)was able to remove the treat disc from the ball and promptly made a huge icky mess on their futon:( The other pup (3.75 lbs) isn't as agressive a chewer, so it's fine for her. I just have to figure out how to give it to the little one without the big one stealing it from her, lol!"
2,BEWARE: SIMULATED STEREO!!!,"More odd remastering tricks that died in 1962. What is wrong with these people?!! This music is supposed to be monaural, bright and punchy with deep bass. Yes, there is surface noise. However, if re-mastered properly, there is also great music. This is over filtered and processed, and it sounds like rubbish. As Louis Jordan said, ""BEWARE"".I own the original 78s and if people could here what these records are supposed to sound like, they would angry with remasters like this."
4,A Piece of Heaven,"This is glorious singing of a sumptuous work. It's the recording I always return to, I strongly recommend it."
5,Of the many recordings I've heard this is by far the best,"""Four Last Songs"" remains one of those pieces I will collect by many artists. I first heard this piece and this version in the film ""Year Of Living Dangerously"" (one of my favorite movies of the 80's). ""Four Last Songs"" brought the film to a feverish pitch which made both film and music all the more powerful. This was Richard Strauss's last composition. The power of this music is that of a man who has lived life well and wants to express his final magnificient, majestic remembrance in one last piece, and he did it so well. Kiri has one of the finest voices of opera, and found a piece in which to use it fully. This cd is a total joy and experience."
1,Read the Kirkus review,"This ""biography"" chronologically jumps all over the place...tired old anecdotes, many not even involving Milnes...poorly written...this one is bad even for a celeb biography....nuff said."
3,Red River Rivalry,"I was just a little disappointed in ABC's production of Oklahoma vs Texas: College Football's Greatest Rivalries. The actual production itself was adequate, but the host, John Suanders, knew little if anything of the rivalry. Where was Keith Jackson or Brent Musburger? There were a few inaccuracies as well as a few butchered names. ABC gets a ""D"" on this one."
3,attic window ideas,Purchased this book to help me with ideas for a quilt project. Will pass it on to my son who is an architect. He will enjoy having it on his library shelf.
4,Just as good as All-Clad,"I have a 7pc All-Clad set that I just love, but needed a few other sizes to complete my set. This pan can be found in the All-Clad line from the Chef catalog and it cost about three times as much. So I took a chance on buying this one and was so suprised that it is just as good. The only reason the 4 stars is 1.Made in China All-Clad is one of the last few products made in America, 2.many people do not like these pans because of the rivets inside the pan to hold the handles. The all-clad pan has two big ones easy to clean around,this pan has 4 on each handle and a bit hard to get in there to clean around it,but if you let the pan soak awhile it makes it easier. This really is a great deal for a pan you will use all the time."
3,Not so pleased.,"I purchased to use with my induction cooktop....works great. However, the bottom of the pan is not FLAT! Stirring the contents is only possible if the pan is held steady. Other pans from this line have been outstanding."
4,Great for dogs that pull,This was a great purchase. Very cost effective way to control the dog that pulls too hard when you are walking. Now we can walk her without getting a sore arm in the end. She learned very quickly and walks gently and still gets to go on adventures
4,Very good training collar,"This is a very effective training collar, and it is the only one that works really well out of the four that I have tried. I personally slip the collar over my dog's head, which she tolerates with no problem. This avoids the problem of unsnapping the links that one user has reported. This may not work for some dogs. But honestly, it is not a big deal to unsnap these links. It takes the slightest amount of practice to the the hang of the motion that is required."
4,great alternative to the metal prong,"works great with the proper training. effective tool to help you and your dog walk as one. And to those who reviewed negatively thinking this is a torture device, you are obviuosly an uneducated dog owner. Is it better for your dog to pull you into the street or pull the leash out of your hand and they get hit by a car or attack another dog? My advice is have a trainer help you find the most effective tool for you so you can control your pet. P.s. if this collar or any prong or choke are used properly it virtually eliminates the amount of corrections needed to control your dog. I do agree these types of collars, not used properly can be harmful. seek a professional to guide you. Do that and then make your comments"
5,great,"This product works perfect, however I would order additional links at the same time you order the collar, unless your dog is extremely small."
3,Not a miracle cure,"Got two - one for my 80 lb short-hair, flat-coated male & the other for my 40lb short-hair, flat-coated female. Neither dog is impressed. My arms are still numb after our walks. They still pull and tug, perhaps slightly less aggressively than they used to (I think I'm being generous here), but in any case, they still pull.On the plus side - they are perfectly usable collars and well priced. I leave the collars on full-time. The instructions say to remove the collars by snapping open the links (very difficult!), rather than pull the collar over the dog's head. I just leave it on. The dogs don't seem the slightest bit bothered by it."
2,Breaks Super Easily!,"This collar is great in theory. But, considering it is meant to train dogs, it should be stronger in order to handle dogs that might pull, etc."
5,Training collar,"This collar works fantastic. I bought a large but it was too small. The bad is the 3 link add-on that I needed to get was almost the price of another large collar. I purchased another collar, took the links I needed and gave the other collar to a friend with the same results. The dogs stop pulling immediately without choking themselves like they did with a normal choker collar."
3,Large is Too Small for Growing Akita,"Concept and quality are good, collar is lighter and looks far less Medieval than the chromed steel prong collar we have used successfully for months. Disappointed that description says 21"" circumference, but on our 11-month old dog, it's actually less than 20"" inside circumference. So I had to purchase a second collar in order to gain one link. (Expansion kit of 3 links costs as much as a whole collar. Duh!) I actually plan to contact manufacturer with negative feedback, if they don't read this and get back to me first."
3,Works fairly well ... kind of short.,"We have a 60-pound dog that's sort of large, but hardly huge. This collar is tight going on and off even though it's supposed to be ""large."" You have to yank pretty hard (which we really don't want to do) for there to be a pinch effect. So, it's not as hazardous as a choke collar, not as evil-looking as a metal pinch collar, and therefore there are trade-offs."
4,It works on hyper aussie,Our dog had trouble meeting other dogs on walks. Tended to lunge at them. This collar creates enough pressure to get his attention without hurting him or pinching the skin. He's now learning to walk at our side with a loose leash.
4,So Far So Good,"I tried out my new collars tonight and it worked great. I noticed an improvement immediately. Please note I have two German Shepherds that are leash trained prior to using this collar. I purchased this because I have two large dogs and walking them when they are excited is difficult, normally after 15 min match of tug of war they would be good dogs. This collar I hoped will help me to train and control them more easily and it did. The largest collar is a bit snug I am pulling it over the head and not using the snap, so I have ordered the extension links for more room. I am nervous about the plastic links breaking if one of my dogs really wanted to pull away so I clip the leash to the training and their normal collar too for extra security.I like the design of this collar better than the metal prongs. Those metal prongs looked an felt like they would really hurt and I just couldn't do that to my puppies."
1,Cheap and not easy,No clasp provided to take collar on/off quickly/easily. Removal of collar only done by taking apart the links (the same way that you initially size the collar). This is extremely difficult and unacceptable. Rope is also cheap and will break w/daily use. I have a 60lb dog and this collar is tight. Also plastic is cheap and sharp. I had to return it because of all these things.
3,Triple Crown Collar,"The product is good and works well for stopping a dog from pulling, my only complaint is that I can't get it undone I have to have my husband put it on and off of the dog"
2,not sturdy enough,"I bought this for my 2 year old pit bull and while it did slow him down a bit while walking him, it was hard to open and close. The links had to be twisted a certain way which was physically too hard on my hands. I was also worried it would open up when I was walking him."
2,"Disappointing, at best.","I got this for my Great Dane several months ago and it's been completely ineffective in curtailing her pulling. If anything, she pulls more against this than she has anything else collar-wise. This is far from an ideal collar if you have a 130 pound puppy that seemingly has ADHD."
1,insane,I would like to put this collar on any person that bought one of these for their dogs and give it a good yank.Then they can tell me how humane it is.People that put collars like these on their pets make me wonder who the real animal really is?
3,"almost a great product, but with a weak link","This collar is an amazing concept and design, and it works perfectly - almost. As with anything, it's only as good or strong as its weakest link: the fabric lanyard/cord that links the collar to the leash ring. The lanyard has worn through in just 90 days. That said, I'm ordering a replacement collar, at my expense, as the return/replace period is just 30 days. Great product, but you might plan to buy another one before long . . . ."
4,So far so good,"We run a dog rescue and we purchased this to work with a Doberman Great Dane mix who is currently 96 lbs with zero training. He bucked like a bronco on the leash and with both the halti and the gentle leader so we purchased this. It has worked wonders. With the training collar, time and patience he has turned the corner and on the road to obedience and a forever home."
3,Worked great the second time around,"This is the second time I've purchased one of these collars. When I put it on the dog, the metal ring broke in half immediately. Had to return it, but am overall pleased with the replaced product. These collars work like a charm if you know how to use them and want a more gentle alternative."
2,flimsy and tough to take off,"I first got this collar as an alternative to a metal prong collar, however the results were very disappointing. It is very hard to take the chains off. The prongs don't give enough of a pinch to refocus my dog's attention back to me. I would recommend sticking to the traditional metal prong collar or this version with the clip: <...>"
3,Not for my dog,"I have a 1 year old 60lb Weimeraner mix puppy. We started training him to not pull during walks with the gentle leader. We really liked the gentle leader until he learned to remove it and would pull anyways. We bought this training collar to try something a bit more aggressive than gentle leader. It helps somewhat with the pulling, but he still pulls through the pain. My dog is not smart enough to connect the choking with him pulling on the leash."
2,Not able to get it to work,"I have a Pit Bull mix that pulls me down the street when we go for walks. I have tried everything such as Gentle Leader, etc. to train her. I was excited to see so many five star reviews on this collar. I am a woman with small hands and I was not able to wriggle the plastic prongs apart. I re-read the directions six times to make sure I was doing it correctly but the collar would not budge so I could correctly fit it around my dogs neck. So I guess if you are a man with hands of steel you can make this work but if you have weak hands then do not purchase. Back it goes..."
1,"Ahhh, Not Happy","I was very happy with this collar up till about 30 minutes ago when it broke, on a busy street, with a cars driving by. I've had it for 3 months now and used it daily on my 45 pound Olde English Bulldogge. She's strong but this shouldn't have happened. If she wasn't so well behaved she easily could've ran into the street and been hit by a car. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product."
1,"A big, determined puller quickly turns this collar into a rope (easily broken)...","Tried this collar on my 90# rottweiler, who gets a bit excited around other dogs and requires a good snap on the leash to keep her from pulling. It works well, getting the dog's attention back, and isn't harsh, but the thing is FRAGILE. It made it about a week before one of the plastic links simply snapped, and I was left holding a leash with no dog attached.I subsequently purchased and highly recommend theHerm Sprenger Prong Collar 22 inch XHeavyweight. This item is more expensive (not by much, once you purchase the extra links necessary for the StarMark, which the Herm Sprenger doesn't need), but it works just as well - and it WON'T BREAK. I think the Herm Sprenger is probably a little gentler on the dog's neck, as well - the prongs aren't sharp like the teeth on the StarMark."
4,This thing works,"I have a 1.5 year old pit bull. She's sweet but dang, pulls like gangbusters on her leash. I had her on a gentle leader---which started shredding almost immediately. Pit jaws are so square, the leader is not a good fit. IMO. Anyway, I needed a solution and did not want a metal choke chain. Viola! Enter the StarMark collar. She still pulls but I have much more control and she has gotten better walking and running on the leash. I'm not saying this is for everyone, I realize there are some bigger dogs out there (mine is about 55 lbs) for whom this might not be enough. But for my situation, it worked."
4,Works well,Pretty happy with this color. It is our second one (1st one lasted about a year and then the connections of the links came appart). All in all I like it.
3,Eh,"Our dog is a 75 lb boxer-pit bull terrier mix. This was effective the first time, in that he was not used to the feeling. Second time around? Pulling harder than ever, like always :) For those saying these are cruel, try taking our little pup for a walk around a dog-filled neighborhood. You'll notice the darn thing more than he does."
3,A bit hard to connect and disconnect,"We had a collar very similiar years ago for training purposes. It must have been a different brand. Unfortunately I can not remember the name. This collar works excellently once on, to prevent my dog from pulling. The one thing I am having an issue with is that it is diffcult to snap and unsnap the links."
2,"Not big enough for my pit bull, now I have to pay more for links?","Collar cost a touch under $10.00 it is very tight on my dog and now I have to pay half again to make this ""large"" collar fit my large dog. Come on folks, the links can't cost more than a few cents to make. Sell a product that does the job and doesn't cause problems."
1,Sux......Big Time,This doesn't work at all. My dog is still pretty small and he had no problem whatsoever continuing his pulling and tugging. I got this one because the others just look like they could pierce his skin and I didn't want that. Just save your money or try some other product. This one wont work.
1,Horrible,"Might be the worst collar I have ever purchased, it did absolutely nothing to prevent either of my dogs from pulling. I would not recommend this collar to anyone what so ever."
1,"Does not work, Waste of money , dont buy","I have a lab pup that is under 6 months old and under 35 lbs, I am trying to train him to walk along side with a chocking type harness, regular collar and then tried this.This collar is the lease effective. All it does is only chocke and then does not release back. The metal chock collar with longer spikes have a better desired effect to stop the dog from pulling or tuggind. These plastic ridges are not deep enough and if the dog is fluffy or has skin , it probably does not have any effect.I would not recomment to anyone who has a fluffy or hairy dog or for any dog with loose skin."
1,in humane,"seriously, it is amazing to see what people come up with and put on their animals, inhumane, painful, a real trainer will help you avoid painful methods to train your dog, our dogs put up with so much crap because humans are lazy, ignorent..sad...Please dont use prong collar, shock/electric collars or this collar on your beloved friend. It is ineffective, create more problems, and animal is not learning to use the mind, just to avoid certain things because of pain"
1,Torture Device,Torture device for dogs. Pulled my dogs hair and pinched his skin.There are better products available to train your dog.
1,Cruel and horrible,Why don't you wear it for a day and have someone yang on you when do something they don't like.
1,My dog basically ignores it,My German Shepherd wiped the floor with this collar. I thought it would help and it was quite the bargain and 10$/prime.
5,Awesome for Hard to Walk Dogs,"My dog has always been a ""puller"" on a leash - this collar fixed all of that. I dont know how it works, but it does. My large lab now walks great on a leash and does not pull or jerk!"
4,Works but is hard to take off/on,We use this collar for our 2 year old pit mix who weighs about 44 lbs. I noticed a difference in the amount he pulls during our walk (He absolutely hated the gentle leader collar). My only complaint is that it is quite difficult to take off and put on. It requires a little bit of elbow grease.
3,Works great if you want your dog on a leash all the time.,I found with my lab that a shock collar works better. But this training collar works great if you you want your dog on a leash!
2,Kind of blah,"Got this for my 4 month old German shepherd. First I thought this was going to be bigger I got large but its about the same size of a small metal Training collar. I have a metal training collar I use for my other German shepherd which works great but thought hey for only 10 dollars I will try this out. Well my 4 month old didn't even notice it was on didn't listen at all didn't slow her down from pulling, so I put the metal one on her she started to pull and then quickly noticed it was on and stopped. So for others it may work well but I recommend the metal training collars feels a lot more sturdier than this one and works great."
1,Training collar,"Better for smaller dogs.The links can get twisted undone easily with a strong hyper , big puppy."
1,Don't try this,"This collar arrived in the mail & I put in on my husky to go for a walk. I walked inside to get some water, & by the time I got back outside to my dog, he had torn the collar into tiny pieces & was chewing on them. This thing didn't even last an hour out of the box."
5,Perfect and lightweight!,"I purchased this for my new puppy that was lunging and for leash training. I had the smooth martingale collar type before the was not as effective as I wanted. Almost immediatley the unwanted behavior was corrected, as it no longer lunged forward! Also I notced it took coorection with just a slight tug faster so it walks with a good tight heel now. I no longer have to struggle with my dog! Another great thing I like its that the collar is made of a hard durable plastic so its great in water since it won't rust. The plastic makes it far less weight then a metal collar. You can snap a link on and off to adjust the size as your dog grows. One last thing the price is great compared to other collars."
2,same old stuff,"This collar is just another rip-off with regards to training the dog. It is the equal to the old choke chain, just different. Does not work any better."
5,Only had to use it twice!,"We have two biiiggggg dogs, and they were pulling me down the street like it was their favorite hobby! Popped this collar on them both, only had to use it once for each dog and bam, no more pulling. I lent it to our neighbor too, he has a pitbull, and he also raves about it and is buying one too! It was big enough for all three of our dogs, a pitbull, german shorthair, and coonhound. I had used one of the metal ones sold at PetCo and was always panicked that I was hurting my dog or that the prongs would collapse the throat or something crazy, this one is way better! My dogs are the most important thing to me so I didnt want to hurt them , I pressed this collar HARD against my wrist and it didnt hurt at all, just a pressure to remind you, ""Hey, you are a big dog and I don't like having my arm torn out of the socket!"" If you have a puller, or are having a problem with any other training issue , get this collar, just putting it on will make your dog behave!"
2,Training collar,"This collar is EXTREMELY difficult to hook AND unhook from my dog's neck. While walking, the prongs tend to slide to the underside of her neck instead of staying on the top. Since this is supposed to simulate discipline by mother dogs, it should stay on top of her neck, in my opinion. Consequently, her pulling is somewhat lessened, but not completely."
3,Not so sure it is as effective...,"as metal training collars. It seems that our big boy has grown immune to the star probes in his neck. As a result, he is always a few steps ahead and pulling when out on walks. I am glad we purchased two because he got hold of it and ate through the rope holding it together."
3,Solo stone showcases virtuoso guitar talents,"Mick Taylor contributed his considerable talents as a guitarist and as a multi-instrumentalist for the Rolling Stones circa 1968 through 1974 when he unexpectedly quit to pursue a solo career, which never seemed to get off the ground. This 1992 release is suprisingly good. Athough it suffers somewhat from some less-than-inspiring songwriting and only average vocals, Taylor's guitar work is as tasteful as ever and that is reason enough to try this CD. The instrumental numbers, which are quite reminiscent of Jeff Beck's ""Blow by Blow"", showcase his brilliant use of tone and phrasing. Strictly as a guitarist, his abilities are probably equal to Eric Clapton but it seems doubtful he could ever rise to the songwriting or even vocal style Clapton has developed. Regardless, this CD offers some excellent guitar playing worth more than one listen. A must for fans of the Stones circa 1969-74."
4,Mostly amazing,"Not a big fan of the leadoff track, ""Leather Jacket."" Lyrically and musically, it's actually pretty bad. But the next few songs alone, ""Alabama"" and ""Slow Blues,"" are worth the price of the album. The former has some sweet slide and acoustic guitar, while the latter is a wonderful...what else, slow blues romp that is just mesmerizing.Taylor's playing is jaw droppingly good on this album. His song writing is decent. His vocals are not bad. Much has been said about his decision to leave the Stones. Hearing this album makes a case for his departure. But it is a shame there are so few in his catalogue."
2,Not what I expected from Mick,"I bought this CD because I love Mick Taylor's work with the Rolling Stones and John Mayall. What I discovered is that it's Mick Taylor's playing of blues and rock that I love, not his playing in general. This CD is his playing in general. Almost no rock, no stinging searing lead guitar runs. There is some blues, but it's not his best. Not as good as when he played with Mayall or Albert Lee or other sessions he sat in on. To me, these songs are elevator music. There's nothing biting about them. I don't know how to categorize them except to say their NOT rock, NOT blues, NOT examples of his brilliant lyrical guitar runs. I listened to the album twice and threw it away the same day."
3,You know and I know,"He's great and will continue to be so as a blues interpreter. But make no mistake: He gained immortality with Keith Richards with one of the greatest live guitar exchanges ever recorded when they matched riffs on the ""Get Your Ya Yas Out"" verson of Sympathy for the Devil. That live performance alone secures him a place in the parthenon of great blues guitarists."
4,Glad to see this again,"This album was a treat back when it came out. Glad to see it available again on CD. Single remix of Leather Jacket is fun and interesting, but the original still trumps. Only recommendation to Mick and his publicist is to ditch the hyperbolic liner notes accompanying this release. They, or more likely the record company, evidently recruited some adolescent Demosthenes wanna be, raised on Rolling Stone Magazine and Skittles to research Mick's history and craft painfully over the top tripe that only cheapens the real deal. Great tunes and fine playing.Mick, how 'bout something new?"
5,"If I had one CD only on a desert island, this would be it ...","I will not go into detail like others have on the superb playing/writing on this album... even Mick's vocals are great because he is singing ""his"" songs.This album with all its emotion contained within kept me alive through some dark points in my life some 20 odd years ago and to this day is still played at least once every 2 or 3 days in my Car CD player.As the title of this review says ... if I had to choose one album to be stranded with on the desert island, it would surely be this self titled solo album by Mick Taylor."
3,World's Most Underrated Guitarist,"I must admit I thought this would be a cool album. I was surprised by Mick's voice ,which was better than expected, and better than Keith Richards. If this was a soundtrack to a movie, I would have given it a better rating. As it stands--nothing catchy and may not ever be played again. Mick is a guitar playing legend without enough credit and money deserved!!! John Mayall (not quite 18 years old replacing Peter Green), Rolling Stones, and Jack Bruce!!!!!!!!!!!!Need I say more!"
2,Nice graphics - but typeface is too dark and hard to read,"I'd give this nice story 4 stars, if it weren't for the fact that the typeface is awfully difficult to read. Even now, after four or five readings with my daughter, I stumble over some words because the text font is almost illegible in places. Added to that problem is the overall dark and gritty background throughout the story that washes out the similarly dark text. They really should have thought about function before form on this book. The graphics are wild and different but be prepared for your child to ask what things are the first few times through. For example, the main character (a little boy) is scarcely discernible as being humanoid. This will require frequent explanations until the child knows from memory what these abstract drawings are. Read this under a good light!"
2,complicated and shameless Christian apologetics,"While Kant's work is important for many philosophical reasons (e.g., his splendid arguments for how our minds shape our experiences), this book just happens to find Christianity the most rational of all faiths per lots of convoluted ""reasons"" as shallow as they are boring."
2,Most Quoted Passages not Inspiring,"I know of so many passages from books that reveal the wonder of the sea, yet they do not appear in this selection of material. Too many of the selections are actually very poor, I believe being selected only because they mention the oceans, not for their inspiration, beauty, or literate value. I think two thirds of the material in this book is actually quite moribund."
2,It is what it is...,"This DVD is nothing more than a compilation of music videos. Each song and video is based on a different story/person from the Bible, for example Daniel or Esther. The music is pretty good from artists such as Chris Tomlin and Mandisa, however the videos are random and some dull. Some of the videos are short clips from movies (the Story of Jesus) while others are in the style of silent films with grainy, black & white film. Others are nature shots with lyrics. There is no continuity from one video to the next. So that being said, that's what it is. In this DVD there is also a promo / trailer for the docu-drama, ""The Story of Jesus"", which is narrated by Joel Osteen... I personally wasn't moved by this random assortment."
2,Missed several parts,"I heard so much about this being shown LIVE and so I wanted the DVD and I was so excited to buy it and watch it...but although brand new and still in the case with no scratches, towards the middle of the DVD, it was acting like it was already scratched. It kept freezing and breaking in between...... So sad.....due to that I missed a few of the songs and videos and did not get the opportunity to enjoy all of ""The Story""."
4,Powerful Music Videos!,Music from The Story features many excellent music videos that beautifully illustrate the the Bible's message of transformation and redemption. The dramatic footage used in many of the videos is very well done. I discovered that the scenes from the Gospels are also used in a new DVD teaching series called Jesus Revealed.Jesus Revealed: Encountering The Authentic Jesus (Disc 1)
1,Weird,"You know going in that zalman king is not mainstream, but this one was just plain weird. Not sexy, strange..."
4,A Tasty Read,"I'd never heard of Bettina Krahn or her books before picking one up to while-away a long bus ride. I love period pieces and wasn't quite sure what to expect, but once I got past the initial chapter or two, orienting myself with the characters, I was amused and delighted.Being somewhat of a medieval buff and a ""foodie"", the crafting of the genre dishes and delicacies was well-done, and certainly gave this book a nice flavor, if you'll forgive the pun.An easy read that had humor and romance at the same time. I'd gladly pick up other novels done by this author."
1,"Original plot, but romance drags","If you are looking for passionate inner struggles to overcome class-differences or satisfying love scenes ... this is not the book for you. In fact, it hardly feels like a romance novel at all. The first few descriptions of food in the middle ages were interesting, but got very old after the first 50 pages. The hero wears a steel nose band the entire book and is often described in a manner that reminds me of a sniffing-dog. Not much romance or sparkling and witty dialog here. I would pass this one up in favor of ""Like Water for Chocolate."""
1,The Marriage Test,"I couldn't even finish this book and I'm angry that I spent $6.99 for it. I wouldn't even rate it one star. I really use to enjoy Betina Krahn's books, but her series of the Husband Test, the Wife Test and now this latest bomb are good only to put you to sleep. The characters are wooden and never fleshed out, the male character whines throughout the whole book. They barely kiss but all of a sudden are in love. There is no chemistry in any of these books. Either the author is writing a love story in an historical period or the author is writing a historical account and just throwing 2 people in it. There is no heat, no interest, no nothing. What happens with these authors? They get famous and then start charging a ton of money for books that are good for 12 year olds. Don't waste your money."
2,Some good kung fu displayed in this very average movie,"Choi Wang (Blooded Treasury Fight), Ma Chin Ku (Sleeping Fist) and Chan Sam Lam (Master of the Flying Guillotine) play 3 killers who use rodent kung fu styles. They basically go around killing people for no reason. A young woman escapes from her father's whole school being murdered. She trains with a kung fu teacher learning the 8 strikes of the wildcat and then takes revenge at the end of the movie.This is as ordinary as kung fu movies get. The girl is not a bad fighter, and they use a ton of stunt doubling. The rodent styles are nothing special, not even funny. The kung fu fighting itself is pretty good. There are plenty of fights and training scenes so if you really like kung fu movies where the woman is the hero you may want to check this out.2.5/5The Videoasia DVD is widescreen and the picture quality is decent."
5,Ahhh...the memories.,"God, how I used to LOVE this song back in the day. Even now, I can still hear it in my head, and after I saw that GPS commercial, with an audio clip digitally remastered, I just fell in love with it all over again, even though it was only 2-3 seconds. Still, it only took that long to remember the timesI would listen to that faithfully. I've yet to own it on audio CD/DVD, but soon plan to now. This looks like something that would come from Heaven itself, to be completely digitllly restored and remastered!!! What a dream come true! Well, I'm sold, how 'bout you?"
1,"It is a game, not for learning piano","Just a game - kind of like hitting flying missiles before your time runs out - only this time you are trying to hit as many right notes as they move across the screen. Nothing more. Just a game. If you want to learn to play piano, try something else."
4,HDT 4.5 Not a bad product,"Well, I like the layout of the program. I like it's performance in the overall also... But, I don't like the fact that it requires a serial number just to install. That, I think, is the only part about the program I don't like."
3,Unsatisfying,"The Complete Caving Manual left me feeling unsatisfied. I am a novice caver who has only been twice. I don't know enough to know what questions I should be asking, so while I felt that the information provided was good, I didn't feel like it made me a whole lot more confident than I was before. There is a lot of information about cave life, safety, conservation, and things like that that were interesting. Most of the examples talked about caving in Britain, so if you aren't in the UK, you will have to relate in a more general way. I will keep this book. It may become more useful to me as my knowledge grows, but in the meantime I am looking for something else as well."
3,Knitted mittens,"While the mittens were a nice quality, I purchased them for a friend with an arm in a cast, so with swollen hands. The mittens did not have enough ""give"" to allow him to put them on the hand with the broken arm, which was the point in purchasing them. They are a nice product, but unfortunately did not meet my needs this time."
1,"Great language, horrible book","Modula-3 is one of the great milestones in programming language design.It is not, as one of the reviewers of this book has said,a language whose deficiencies were corrected by C++.On the contrary, Modula-3 was developed after C++ (in the late 80s) andin fact corrects many of the deficiencies of that language. Manyof the features of Java and C# were lifted more or less intactlyfrom Modula-3, and the designers of Java have regretted thatthey didn't lift more, as they have had to add generics later.That being said, this is a terrible book. It is poorly organizedand poorly written.Greg Nelson's ""Systems Programming with Modula-3"" is the best book, and most of it is available forfree on the Web. Harbison's ""Modula-3"" is a good introductionfor someone who just wants to know how to write basic programsin the language. Unfortunately neither of these books is inprint any longer..."
2,Poorly Written Bio of Director who desserves better,"I'm sorry to have to do this but the sheer torture of reading this book prompts this negative review.I have been reading this book for the past 2 weeks normally I read movie bios in a matter of days.The author has offered no insight into this man's life and worse he does no critcal thinking in regards to the films,in fact on the silent films I question if he has even seen them.But what promted me to even expend the energy to write this review is when I got to page 66.On that page there is a still which the caption says is from Love when in fact it is from the talking picture remake Anna Karenina and the author is a teacher of film history and he misses this mistake-give me a break.Sadly this is a case of a bad bio happening to a good director."
1,WARNING: Amazon shipping defective products,"I purchased this scale on the June 24, 2004, and it arrived without batteries. I called Tamita who said they have recently received the same complaint from other people who purchased from Amazon. They were very friendly, but said it could take 2-3 weeks or more for them to send out batteries. They need to order them from Japan because they have already pulled out all the batteries from scales they have on-site in their USA office to send to people who got scales without any batteries."
4,Professional and traditonal,"The Corrs delivers what you would expect from them live. The concert was well executed overall, with a good live orchestra and Bono, from U2. The Corrs, however, performed classics such as Runaway, So Young, Radio, and The Joy of Life, all of which their fans have heard many, many times. And the two newer songs, Would you be happier? and Breathless were rather unimpressive. Live in Dublin is good for easy listening, but they failed to produce any new material like they did on their Unplugged album."
1,I hope the Corrs come up with something new,"Boring, boring, boring. Does ""Runaway"" have to apppear in every The Corrs release? They're a very talented band and they really sound nice. I only hope that they come up with new material. It's frustrating for a collector like me to spend money on something ""new"" that I already own."
4,Bottom LIne: It's a good solid record,"Yes they are gorgeous but the music is pretty darn good too. I consider my music taste fairly sophisticated and this is good quality music. The duos with Bono & Ron Wood are great and the version of Ruby Tuesday is amazing.If you like basic, solid pop-rock music with a touch of Irish melodies, this is a great record to have."
5,VH1 Presents the Corrs Live in Dublin,"Hey Corrs fans !I bought this CD about two weeks ago and I'm still happy with it, because it is an other fine example for the unique Corrs sound, which I like so much. Especial the song 'When The Stars Go Blue' with Bono from U2 is my favorite.But I mean all the other songs on this CD are great, of course.So I only can say don't miss this Corrs item !!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Corrs Live In Dublin Review,"This CD Is a Great Compilation of some of The Corrs Most Well Known Songs Recorded in January 2002 Similar to The Corrs other Studio Recording UnpluggedUnpluggedthe Two/Three Songs that are 'New' on this CD Are Summer Wine, Only Love Can Break your Heart and Joy of Life/Trout in The Bath [Instrumental] which as far as I'm Aware aren't on any other of The Corrs Albums the Versions of Their Hits Breathless, Runaway and Radio Etc are Well Worth having No Corrs Collection would be complete without them. They showcase the Corrs Talents. To Have the Quality of a Studio Album and Energy of a Live Performance in one CD A Must for Any Corrs Fan"
4,A Winner!,"Since this is my first time in writing a review for a book.....bear with me. I absolutely loved this book...for the writing, the story, the hero/heroine relationship, and, most definitely, the concept. Wonderful story of good vs evil, literally. And to say anymore along those lines, would give away the plot.This was definitely an original for me, and made my keeper shelf and one of my best books for 2000. I'm not kidding when I say that COME NEAR ME was the first book that I can remember literally not being able to put down....I found myself walking around the house, reading. Hung onto every word.A bit dark/grim...maybe a bit controversial, but for me, those were the high points. Please, give it a try!"
2,Not up to Kasey Michals usual standards,Like one of the other reviewers I could not finish this book. It was really too far fetched and boring. If Adam loved Sherry with all his heart he sure did not act like it. I do believe in Devils and Angels also but this book was bad! bad! bad!
2,Warning: This Product does not contain Hydroquinone,"It appears that D&R produces two versions of skin bleach: one with and one without hydroquinone. The product I received does not contain hydroquinone. Unfortunately, hydroquinone is the only substance that I know of that is proven to work. None of the ingredients on this product are proven to do any skin lightening as far as I know. For that matter, the list of ingredients doesn't even include an ""active ingredient""."
1,Did nothing,"Used it everyday & night. Doesn't work at all if you're african-american or brown skin period. Waste of money, definitely look elsewhere for products with ingredients that will accomplish removing blemishes."
2,Stinks.,I can't say how this works because it simply smells terrible. It has a chemical odor to it and other people notice it.
3,Derringer minus Rick,"This is pretty much the same band that backed up Rick Derringer on his great live album from 77. They're a solid unit, but without Rick's songwriting they seem just a little lacking in memorable tunes. Still a good album for anyone into ""hard rock"" before it became ""heavy metal"""
3,GREAT BUY,THIS FRAGRANCE SMELL'S GREAT! And can be worn night and day.The only complaint is that it does'nt last all day. It's still a bargain and worth buying.
5,exquisit,"I am so happy with this perfume. Its arrived fast, in excellent condition and smell really good. It is not an imitation. Over all, the price was cheap!"
4,"Helpful, practical advice","Mr. Itiel's approach to sex is almost comically business-oriented. Nonetheless, I found his very practical approach reassuring and helpful. Some of the stories are funny, some pathetic.I'd rank the book above the more popular _Hustlers, Escorts and Porn Stars_ by Matt Adams, although Adam's book gives more actual advice."
2,"Good for the beginner, lacking details for the Administrator",I expected more from this book. I suppose this book would be great if I had never worked with DOS or Windows before. It has some good information but lacks solid details when it comes to using Windows 95 in a Windows NT domain.
5,One of the Best Gifts I've Recieved,"I recieved this as a gift and LOVE IT! It is full of everything that is wonderful about Christmas. It is fun, but spiritual as well. Ms. Robinsons voice is beautiful, full of warmth and emotion. Her rendition of The First Noel is one of the most beautiful renditions of a traditional Christmas song I have ever heard."
3,"Good price, fast shipping.","However, I down-graded my rating for this item by 1 star because despite being advertised as having ""free shipping"", the item would show a $3.18 shipping charge during check out. Where this charge came from, I don't know. It doesn't show up in the merchant's ""Shipping Rates"" table. While that table shows $0.00 USPS shipping to either a home address or a PO Box, for the PO Box $3.18 charge would show up a check out. My guess is it is a software error somewhere. Rather than contact the seller to figure it out, I thought it would be faster just to ship to my home mail box, which is not as secure as my PO Box and therefor not my preference."
4,Double Live Gonzo - Ted Nugent,"It's Ted Nugent. Sometimes that's all you have to say. Before the flaming arrows across the stadium and the cooking show he could be summed up - It's Ted Nugent. Contains Stanglehold, one of America's air guitar favorites, and a fun version of Great White Buffalo. If you've seen him in the last 10 years you know this is the same guy-no dimmer switch ! Raw Gibson ES and a mountain of Marshall, what every rock guitarist always wanted but few of us could ever pull off. Don't remember if it came with a parental warning label but a few choice syllables here and there, not enough to get him thrown out of the Republican party. In his own words ""let it melt into your mouth""."
5,Unbelievable Guitar!,"This has been one of my all time favorites since I was 18. I play it to this day. The guitar sounds are like nothing you've ever heard before, I promise. If you want to hear a guitar sound like a rhino foaming at the mouth, you have to get this. To those who haven't heard it yet, you will be upset when you realize how much time you lost."
5,Full Bluntal Nugity,The Nuge tears it up yet again with this CD. Everything from Great White Buffalo to Cat Scratch Fever. A true Nuge experience. and remember DONT TO DRUGS!!!
4,Uncle Ted's best live album,"This is Nugent's best live album, and maybe his best album ever! I love this album. It really rocks hard - 70's-style power chord rock. I especially like ""Great White Buffalo"" - it's a long song, but worth the time. I also like this live version of ""Stormtrooper"" (I like it better than the studio version). The band seems pretty tight here - no sloppy playing like I hear on some live albums. Great 70's rock!"
1,Sticker Shock!,"First of all...I agree with the person who said this was overpriced. It's one of the reasons I don't like boxed sets. And I see no reason for this to be a boxed set, to be honest. The maps aren't very detailed, and not created by a professional cartographer, which I would expect for a product in this price range. The writing is choppy, and the plot lines are overly complicated.The screen, from what I saw, wasn't very helpful, and the character sheets don't seem any different than what I can get online. This product in no way lives up to the hype.If it is true, and this is being produced by the official fan site...then I can certainly see why the quality has gone downhill. That particular site is cliqueish, and the members are rude. It's sad, to see this line marginalized this way, not to mention that FFG seems to have been hit with the whacky stick of profit."
5,Great Book.,"This book is about Plus One. It has facts about each of the guys, interviews, & great pics. Buy it if you're into Plus One (I mean, why wouldn't you be?). :)"
4,One pleased son in my house!,Our youngest son is developementally delayed and has loved everything Disney all of his life. His Goof Troop VHS quit working and was he ever pleased to find it on DVD!!! (and so was I!!)
2,more episodes,"This series came out with about 78 episodes, and to only put 3 on volume 1 is rediculous. I hope the second will be better."
2,Disappointed,"This isn't a VHS, Disney! I'm very disappointed that this only contained three episodes when I was hoping for a decent set to repeat a few more times. Despite how much I love this show, this many episodes on a single disk is going to get boring to watch very fast."
1,Just Three Episodes? Lame!,"Unless you are a fan of Max Goof and like the show, do not purchase this DVD! The episodes are not even 22 minutes long! >:("
1,Not what I was expecting,"the fact that this disc only includes 3 episodes was so disappointing. I was expecting a collection of episodes instead I got a select, sub-par few. gave it away to a coworker and will download it from a torrent site."
1,"Goof Troop, Volume 1","My son, age 22, felt that this was not worth the money because it was only part 1. I must agree"
4,Goof Troop? Okay!,"I used to watch this cartoon when I was a kid! Max is my favorite. This dvd has only three episodes the one I like is ""Wrecks, Lies, and Videotape"" that one was pretty good. But I wish Disney didn't hog all those great cartoon shows they had like goof troop, Pepperann, or Recess and Release them in complete seasons on dvd. The Disney channel today is not good like Disney Afternoon or Disney's One Saturday Morning they should bring back the old Disney cartoons from the 90s. YOU HEAR ME DISNEY FOR GOODNESS SAKES BRING BACK THOSE GOOD OLD 90s CARTOONS AT LEAST!"
2,How Cheap of Disney,This was a great Disney serial that my boys (now young men) watched when they were little. I have to agree with a previous reviewer who stated their displeasure that Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers and Duck Tales Volumes 1 were released as 27 episodes and Goof Troop and Quack Pack are set to be released as 6 episodes. Disney should go for the full meal deal or not release the dvd at all: this gives the consumer a real price comparable to $67.50 retail where the other two came in at around $40. Who's getting goofed? The consumer. Do it right or don't bother!
1,I don't get it,Releasing 27 episodes for a volume 1 of the Rescue Rangers was a good idea... why is volume 1 of goof troop only 6 episodes? Do they not plan to release this show much at all?
1,LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME,What you thinking Disney? Do you think the fans who have supported you over the years so stupid that they will consider three episodes slapped on a DVD acceptable as a 'Volume 1'???? This is honestly quite offensive. I loved this cartoon and want to see it done justice with a DVD set like DuckTales or Talespin. And while you're at it how about doing the same for The Little Mermaid and Aladdin series.
3,it could be better,"hmm....its nice but it could be better, i hope the second volume will be better. because three episodes is not a good deal. and honestly thats why i gave it three stars."
5,Excellent Resource for all pregnant women!,"I found this book to be very helpful and objective. It provides useful, relevant and unbiased information on helping a woman figure out the best birthing method based on her own, unique personality. It's easy to read and an excellent resource. I highly recommend it!"
5,Stands out from the glut of pregnancy books,"This book is the only non-judgemental, totally informative book I have read throughout this process of being pregnant. It offers genuine INFORMATION about preparing mentally for the birth of your baby. I have been amazed at how condescending a lot of the pregnancy books are -- this was refreshing. It's also new so the info is up-to-date. You won't offend any mom-to-be with this book. It honestly respects every woman's choice from the totally holistic no-meds option to those who want an epidural right away. Would give it 6 stars if I could..."
5,No more dogma in the delivery room!,"This book was perfect. In a time where there is so much pressure to have a certain kind of birth experience this book throws all of the dogma out the window. It provides you with unbiased information to make the decision based on what is best for you and your baby/babies. If you feel guilty about any part of your pregnancy or birth choices, get this book and make the decision for yourself!"
3,Its great but one has little control,I like d the price of the MP3 player plus the fact that it had a mic to record voice. I don;t like the fact that you can't move forward or backward within a MP3 thats playing only to the next or previous song. But it serves it purpose but is very basic
4,Very entertaining and well made.,"This is ""El Ultimo de la Fila"" last album before their break-up (Manolo Garcia & Quimi Portet). Most of the songs are good, except ""Bailaras como un Indio"" which does get on my nerves. This is unusual, since El Ultimo de la Fila has prided themselves as being a flawless band, pumping out albums without a single annoying song. My favorite songs on the album are: ""El bombero del atardecer"", ""Sin llaves"" and ""A medio sonar"", which I found to be quite a humorous song. I highly recommend this album, eventhough it's not their best, it nevertheless has extreme musical value."
2,modern physics serway,"this book is ok, but it assumes alot of prior knowledge. i found that i could only understand the material presented in the book after i read an easier text on the subject. this book also had alot of errors in it. i spent 2 hours trying to derive something, only to discover that the book had a plus sign in a formula where it should have had a minus sign. i recomend modern physics by tippler or concepts of modern physics by beiser. beiser's book is easier, and tipplers book is more indepth, but both books assume no prior knowledge of the subject."
2,Incomplete,"I had this book for Modern Physics and after two semesters with it, I can tell you this book makes the class much harder than necessary. I was beginning to think I was an idiot, but I scraped up enough money to buy the Eisberg book from Amazon and as soon as I got it, it was readily apparent that the Serway book was incomplete, leaving out necessary concepts and leaving it to the student to fill in some big holes.The Eisberg book and the Serway book are complete opposites; Eisberg giving you more information than you need and the Serway book glossing over what you need to know. With these two choices, I'll take (and did take) too much information any day. If your professor uses this book, do yourself a favor and look for help elsewhere, unless you're one of those people who can read Cliff Notes and wing it, because with the Serway book, that's exactly what you'll be doing."
5,Cheaper than student bookstore!,"Funny book. The author writes it with a twist of literary perspective, instead of just the cold hard facts. The emphasis on history is educational in itself. I saved allot of money buying online, versus at my student bookstore."
1,Dry like sandpaper,"I used this book as an introduction to modern physics for the first semester of my modern physics sequence. This is what I think of the book:ProsThe book is fairly easy. Lots of examples to help with the end of chapter problems. Lots of history (Yawn).ConsBoring. Too many references to histroical developments. Lots of information but well not well developed. In fact that's all this book is, a bunch of disjointed facts. The people who wrote this book spent way too little time developing IDEAS and the MATH that describes them. Instead, they skimmed over TONS of details and spit out formulas in pretty pink boxes. Anyways, the writing is dry, lengthy, and dodges the point. It's like reading an encyclopedia of physics history. Inelegant. Ineffective.Oh by the way, THIS BOOK STINKS (or maybe it's those pink boxes I hate).You may like it, but i didn't."
3,Complicated,This book assumes you've had more physics in the past then perhaps you have. The examples in the book skip major steps and assume that you can follow. It focuses way too much on the people who came up with the theories than on the theories and mathematics themselves.
2,horrible,"This is probably one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. The authors know the material so well, that they automatically assume the reader will as well. Avoid like the plague."
5,A GREAT BAND,"The most underated and underappreciated band in rock history gives another superior performance again as they have for so many years since 1968 . Ian Anderson is the ultimate performer and musician, who for some unknown reason is not recognized in the Rock World , for not only his talents but the bands ultimately excellent performances. Jethro Tull gives true meaning to the phrase ""This band is so tight"" , have you ever seen a group of musicians that play well togther as they do? Why they are not inducted in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is truly one of the music world's biggest blunders. Thank You Ian Anderson & the members of Tull for many years, of enjoyment."
4,Great music,This dvd is jam packed with great Jethro Tull tunes. Very lively performance and entertaining. A great one for any rock and roll collector.
4,Excellent show by 21st century Tull,"If you're a Tull fan wondering whether to get this concert or purchase the ""Living With The Past"" DVD, get this concert. This is a really nice, long, well-played set with lots of great songs from many different stages of their career. It is (like all the Montreux DVD's) well shot and well recorded. ""Living With The Past"" for some reason was ill-conceived, poorly directed, and tries to salvage an off night for them, which it can't. So stick with this one - a great example of latter day Tull - not so edgy anymore, but very polished and professional musicians who - God bless 'em - are still at it!"
4,Great Musical Talents,"Because I had been to several Tull concerts in the early to mid seventies and I read in some reviews that Ian's voice had changed, I was expecting to be disappointed. Not so thankfully, Ian has adapted well to his changing voice. This BD showcases that great aging musical talents can adapt and still provide very enjoyable entertainment. Ian as always is energetic and animated in displaying his many musical talents, and the band just jams so well together. Sound quality is great in DTS HD Master. Which brings up the fact that Amazon's details lists this as just DTS 5.1 and they have done this on the details for many other BDs as well. Amazon needs to get their head out of their a** and realize DTS HD is a great selling point, because I rarely buy concert BDs unless it is recorded in DTS HD.BTW, for those who appreciate and enjoy great aging bands check out the Moody Blues BD Lovely to See You."
5,Jethro Tull: Live at Montreux,"Tull fans will like this dvd. Even if his voice is a bit ""aged"", his flute is still ""magical""!"
3,One of the Better Later Tull DVDs,Diversified set and tight playing band make this one of the better recent Tull live DVDs. I still prefer the older shows that are available.
3,Strange set list and a disjointed performance,"It's always great to get the opportunity for new Tull footage so I can see why the other reviews are so positive. The DVD production values areexcellent. There are some strange moments for me, which seem to center around the drumming and timing. Hard to articulate but for me the group just seemed ""off"" at times. ""EMPTY CAFE"" was a highlight for me...instrumental off Martin's solo album. It was nice to see that on the DVD. I am not real pleased with the performance on the DVD and upon reading between the lines in the liner -notes maybe Ian Anderson wasn't either.?"
3,"Okay, but...","I'm have been a Tull fan for many years and a musician myself. This is just an okay DVD, unfortunately. Ian's flute playing is the best part. He stills has it and may be better than ever. His singing, on the other hand, leaves something to be desired. He consistently signs behind the beat and seems to be out of breath a lot of the time. Yeah, I know, he's getting up there in years. Still worth a look for a serious fan."
3,Bush Flying to Blind Flying,Interesting book if you love old airplanes and true stories of flying in remote areas. Lots of unique period photos. A few of the airplane photos are MISS LABELED but not everyone would notice this. Well researched and written otherwise.
5,"Sounds Just Like Sting, Sheryl Crow, and Dave Mathews!",I can't believe how clever and well done this CD is! All of the singers sound just like the pop stars they're imitating. This album is perfect for parties --everyone loves it.
5,Hilarious!,"This comedy by Diann Hunt is hilarious, same as 'Hot Tropics and Cold Feet'! Diann blends humor with situations that mid-life women can relate with, all while throwing in good morals and clean, decent living. These books are like a breath of fresh air, so refreshing that I just ordered 2 more of her books!"
3,Christian reading,It's a cute book but maybe I missed something in the product detail. This is most definitely a Christian read. References of scripture and prayer are throughout the book. I think it should mention this somewhere in the overview as it may not appeal to some readers. Nothing wrong with the references but just think it should be mentioned.
1,Poorly Designed Filtration System,This vacuum cleaner brings Hoover a bad image for the poorly designed filtration system that constantly becomes clogged and requires disassemblement to remove.
4,Yippee-ki-yay...,"This was the perfect intro to making sense of all the old heroes, villains, events, dates & times and even Indian tribes of the Old West. There's a lot to take away from this book that can help one understand & appreciate other events of the same period or those that sprang from 1870-1890. I can also truly say that I'll never look at the old westerns again like I used to. If only there were more illustrated maps to help plot the courses of these old-timers, it would've gotten 5 stars. But get it anyway."
3,Unknown Cd,"THis Is Truly Hard to find,But don't waist you're effort treasure hunting this cause it's missing some gems.It's ok and average at best.Stand out songs are:Take It Leave It,Sealed and Delivered.The Rest is mediocre."
3,"Not as good as volume 3, but better than volume 1","The first episode on this tape was one I liked because it was funny how the two girls, Chocolate and Tira, kept torturing poor Carrot. The end of the 1st episode was also nice because it showed Carrot's dedication to helping out a friend in need. He was triumphant in the end because he did get to the girl to help her set off the fireworks, despite all the obstacles in his way. Also, I think the 2nd episode on this cassette was the best on the tape. In ""A Dreamy Girl at Lakeside"", Carrot meets a little girl at a lake and shows humility and kindness by entertaining the child and doing everything to make her happy. Throughout the whole episode, the girl visits Carrot and he is always able to identify her, even though it only takes her hours to become years older. The third episode on the cassette was a disappointment. It was dull and wishy-washy. But all in all, this volume was pretty good!"
3,Sorcerer Hunters Review by Blue,"Sorcerer (Bakuretsu) Hunters is a really awsome series -- there's a lot of humor blended in with just enough action as well as sword and sorcery. Volume 2 was really good; just as hilarious as the rest of the series. Still, I think Volume 1 was better by far."
1,RFU & XBox ???,"It is either the RF adapter or the XBox but something just does not work right; there is severe sound interference some where. Nobody has any answers - not Micro$oft or whoever. I find that tech-support that goes beyond 'is it plugged in?' just does not work.I find, for the most part (90% of the time), that NEW-TECH just will not work with OLD-TECH."
4,1/2 carot heart jurney pendant,"The pendant is beautiful, just as expected. The neckless however is a bit short at 18 inches. Needed to get one at 20 inches to properly display. All else was fine."
4,Very Good,Very helpful with my class. Some good questions to spur discussion and some fun activities. Would have liked more ideas for activities.
5,An Informative Guide to the Chronicles of Narnia,"The book contains so much information about the Chronicles of Narnia. Yet, the best part is the book's format. It is not a dull learning tool. Using the book is recreation. Martin French's illustrations are so colorful and full of energy. Look at the book's cover."
3,"An Excellent Read, But Lacking Originality","Roar! is an excellent guide for families searching for external essays on Lewis' children's masterpieces. I found the sections for the parents and children easy to differentiate, and even found parts of the children's sections enjoyable and entertaining to read (this coming from a 22-year old).But when it comes to some of the essays, I found that there was really no originality between one essay from the next, as they seemed to reiterate quite a few things. Some of the essays positioned in the earlier pages (i.e., those essays entitled ""Dad's Reading Chair"") also didn't make any initial sense, until, as I read on in further essays, I was able to slightly understand what the author was intending.It's a good read for those seeking external help on teaching The Chronicles to their children, and the illustrations are lovely; but, if you fall under any of the other categories not found in family or artist, then I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Could be a LOT better,"My one big complaint with this book is that it combines traditional and simplified characters. The ""grammar notes"" (which are just footnotes) and index are written in traditional characters, while the homework is written in simplified characters. There should be two completely different editions of this book: one for simplified, and one for traditional."
5,Love the Mamur Zapt!,These books are a treasure trove. They could only be purchased in the UK years ago but now are all available here and Mr. Pierce has written more! Wonderful look at the sights and sounds of Cairo in the 1900s. Pierce is terrific!
2,"Too much talk, to little action","This is suppose to be a ""suspense tale"" as the writer calls it but all I read was a bunch of talk, more talk, and even more talk. And they aren't very lively conversations either."
2,Poorly written mystery,"This book appears to have been written with thirteen- to fifteen-year-old kids in mind. The language is incredibly simplistic, the plot devices make no sense and are totally unbelievable in any case. If the rest of the books in this series are of the same caliber, it's a wonder that the author has continued it for as long as he has. In short, this book is awful. The 3 is for the scenery and the author's description of life in colonial Egypt, which is somewhat believable"
3,Nice round out to a collection,Good pre-dvelopment and early development history. I would only recommend this book for collectors trying to round out their collections.
3,nice but not representative,"finally shake makes amazon.com, but this is a mediocre release at best. none of these songs get played anymore and are rather light and poppy. look for shake's acoustic stuff solo, with dana cooper, or with jack saunders - these are the real pleasures we know here in texas. time spent is ok."
5,I FOUND HIM!!!,I can't believe I finally found Shake Russell. What I really want to know now is how do I get the rest of his albums or tapes.I experienced him in person in Galveston in 93 with someone whowas and will always be very special in my life and the album Listen with your heart makes my heart beat faster bringing back memories very strong. If anyone who reads this knows how or where to get those earlier musical tapes of his Please put in a review for me!!!YOU GO SHAKE! You are awesome......Beth
1,1978-Stuck in the middle,"Shake got stuck inbetween the Disco ERA and New Wave.He needed to reinvent himself from the Jim Croce period whichhappened 10 years prior to that. When folk remerged in the late90s, Shake was still trying figure out the Disco scene.This album reflects that sound. Save your money and buy Croce'sgreatest hits"
4,A Welcome Addition to Bondage,"The expanded or ""composer's cut"" cd for David Arnold's soudtrack to ""Tommorow Never Dies"" follows a recent, and very welcome, development, that is soundtrack recordings that include the major part of the recorded score rather than ""representative selections."" The original soundtrack album was missing a good deal of a very good Arnold score. In place of the missing cuts were both vocals, as it should be, but also a Moby rendidtion of the James Bond theme which, at best, could be labled ""interesting."" There is only one negative about this recording...it should include Arnold's vocal ""Tommorow Never Dies-Surrender"" (the only reason this cd is reduced to four stars rather than a full five). Otherwise, this is a most important step for soundtrack recordings, and a very nice buy. The interview with Arnold seemed a waste at first glance, but it is worth a look."
4,Good Expanded Release!,"The expanded release of Tomorrow Never Dies completely makes the first release obsolete! In this composers cut, it adds the remaining 20-so minutes of score that was missing from the first release and places it in the correct order. And the interview at the end is interesting on how Arnold composed the score. Arnold really hits home with this score. Almost in the style of John Barrys earlier scores. But Arnold adds modern styles of the James Bond theme into a nicely bleneded of music worthy of the 4 stars Im giving it. But two things are missing: the tracks ""Station Break"" and Mobys version of the James Bond theme from the first album. With the inclusion of these tracks, this album would be worth 5 stars.A must have for any James Bond music lover!"
5,Jesus in modern time,The author said: 'MORE PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT CHRIST IF HE WAS MORE HUMAN' in the book Christ is more than human. Experience Jesus life stages in our modern times. This book is just incredible! I'd like to see it on the big screen.
5,WOW!!!,"WOW!!! That's all I can say about this book. So captivating that it makes you wonder. If this book isn't a bestseller, i'll be surprised. I couldnt put it down. Buy this book if you want suspense, intrigue, and if you want something to make you think about religion and the world today..."
1,To Pricey.,"After doing some digging, I've found out that Panasonic seems to be the supplier of Canon tapes. Makes sense since Canon camcorders used to be packaged with Panasonic tapes. Panasonic tapes are much cheaper and of the same quality as the Canon ones."
2,ANTIQUATED,"The information provided in this book is extremely dated and unrealistic. I live in California and I do understand the real estate prices are much higher on average than most parts of the country. However, he uses an example of an average 3BR, 2BA home selling for between $10,000 and $15,000 and continues to use these numbers throughout his book. Somebody tell me where these homes exist? Downtown Baghdad? He gives an example of how to determine the value of a rental income property. He says to take the monthly rental amount and multiply it by 100 to determine the value of the property. His example was $150 monthly rent x 100 = house value of $15,000. I own a rental that rents for $1500. If I used his example $1500 x 100 = $150,000 right? Wrong!!! This same property will sell today for $375,000, which means a buyer's tenants would have to pay $3,750 per month. Gee, do these numbers ad up? You figure!"
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book but as I worked my way through it I kept finding myself attempting to puzzle out the author's meaning because of typographical errors, poor proofreading and poor editing. Sometimes I literally could not see the connection between what the text was saying the sample output was and the sample output that was printed on the page. I expect a technical book to be technically clear and this one let me down too many times to instill confidence. I also came away with the sinking feeling that it was at heart a grand advertisement for the WISE software; another confidence killer. This is my second Rampant book and I think my last.To be fair, I learned some new things and will undoubtedly improve my skills because of this book, but I would say to the authors and publisher that you made me more mad than you made me smart. You have lost me."
4,DB Specialist,"Very good, enough internal tips, common sense tips etc. I have read those parts that are interesting for me like AWR/ASH and some tuning spots. I got some good ideas. I have done work over 15 years with Oracle and some other databases. For me this is proper book, specially AWR and ASH. Perhaps even more internal tips which are gained over years pro work would have been waited. Okey, consult must have something of his own, when visiting customer;)"
1,Garbage dollar store quality. Stay away,"This will be the last purchase i make on Amazon based on the products reviews, been burned a few times recently. According to some reviews, this was supposed to be a decent quality mask for the price that lasts several years. What i got in return was a cheap throw away kids mask that is sized for an adult size face. The frame is weak and brittle and the gasket is not rubber or silicon, its this cheap plastic crap that is not capable of keeping water out. i am absolutely turned off by the manufacturer ""Aqua Leisure"", the seller ""Ron's Home and Hardware"", and Amazon for allowing fake reviews!!!! a trend i have noticed recently."
5,goggles,"These were a great buy. I bought these about 3 years ago and the girls used them every summer. They were tossed around and lasted through traveling on vacations. After they grew out of them, they were in good enough shape to pass on to their younger cousins. I'm sure they will get many years use out of them too."
4,"A wonderful, quick read",I've read almost all of F Scott Fitzgerald's work and I was delighted to find this compelation of short stories. I read this book alomst four years ago and I can still remember the characters and details of each story - my favorite was Diamond as Big as the Ritz. Try it out and you will not be dissapointed!
5,F Scott Fitzawesome,F Scott Fitzgerald is the greatest American author of the 20th Century. It's easy to see why with this collection of short stories. What I enjoy best about this book is seeing the experimentation of Fitzgerald's writing from one story to the next. It's fun to see the literary and thematic chances that he took as his career progressed. You should buy this book.
2,This book didn't cover what it should.,"This book didn't cover the ""main"" short stories I thought should be in a ""greatest hits"" of F. Scott Fitzgerald. It did have some of the ""classics."" I would look for another book on short stories before I bought this book."
2,Great idea but pulled apart when puppy lunged,"Definitely worked well on my 6 month old German Shepherd puppy. Made a world of difference taking her for walks and getting her attention when she got excited.Unfortunately, it is not that strong and pulled part when she went after a cat. This is the second time it pulled apart. The first time it happened, I thought maybe I didn't click the links together properly. But this time, if you look at the links, you can clearly see the plastic deformed to allow the separation. I am returning to Amazon and recommending that they inform the manufacturer."
4,Star Mark Collar,"This is the most humane pinch collar we found for our Boxer puppy. I am 6 mos. pregnant, so having her pull on the leash was something we had to take care of right away. We started to see results as soon as we put it on her. Within about a week, her behavior had changed. The only negative thing about it is that since the ring you attach the leash to is nylon, it wears out pretty quickly. All in all, a great purchase."
5,no complaints,Great correction training tool! The collar is indeed safe. I use it on my miniature schnauzer of 6 months at 20 pounds. He does much better on the leash and has also learned a new trick thanks to this device. Train your buddy the right way with this item!
3,More detailed description desired.,"I searched and searched on Amazon and on the web for a correct size description for my 35lbs dog. After about 20 minutes I settled on the small. To my dissapointment, it needs 2-3 more links. I haven't purchased those yet, so I have not had the chance to even use the product. It would be nice if they told you more specific measurements, and how much of a gap is need for training your dog. It didn't even say it on the packaging. My dog currently wears his colar at 18 inches, and this small colar wouldn't even snap shut it was so tight."
1,UNUSABLE,"This is a TERRIBLE product! There are no snaps or anything like that to allow you to actually put it on your pet!! It is not adjustable. So, you cannot size it for your pet or get it on your pet!! If I had the packaging I would be returning it in a heartbeat! IT IS UNUSABLE!! DON'T BUY IT!"
1,I think products such as this should be illegal,This product is cruel and inhumane. This violates animal cruelty laws. People that even consider buying this and similar products should not be allowed to own pets.
2,Ok but not great,I bought this collar for a miniature poodle who only barks at people visiting my home and he barks at them the entire time they are there. When Sam came to live with me almost 3 years ago he was 6 months old; he still barks at my son when he comes to visit which is frequently. The collar works but I must have the leash attached to it so that I can control his barking; therefore I must have notice when someone is coming so that I can put the collar and leash on him; of course that doesn't always happen. There is no latch mechanism on the collar; you have to unclasp a link to take it on and off; this is not easy; it may loosen over time but it has not yet. I bought 2; one for my toy poodle who barks at everything except visitors; needless to say I returned that one. Next I will try a shock collar.
1,#####WARNING#######,This is a horrible collar..I got ot for my dog and it claws into her skin hurting her. I have NO idea why anyone would buy this and keep this ever. BAD BAD purchase!!!!
4,Triple Crown small collar,"This is a good training aid for active dogs. However, remember to buy extra links. The 15"" is very small for most puppies. I use it on my Border Collie puppy. It was too small from the time he was 3 months old. Also, remember not to grab the collar by anything except the cord. It will fall apart easily and then your dog is loose! Roscoe is in training for search and rescue tracking so he naturlly pulls on harness. This collar helps with obedience training which is separate from the tracking training."
4,Don't even have to use it!,"I've seen the complaints about how hard it was to get on, and in the beginning it was. But after a few tries, I've got it down pretty good and have no problem with it, just need to rock it left and right once like the instruction says and it's comes right off / on.This collar really helped my dog with loose leash walking. I really don't even have to ""use"" it anymore after the first few times because he knows what it is when I put it on and is very good when we go on walks. When I don't put it on, he is getting a lot better at heeling but still will bolt because he knows it is a regular collar.I would recommend this collar, it's helps out a lot."
2,did not help pulling,This collar did not work any better than any other collar that I have tried and the plastic makes it difficult to get on and off
3,didn't work on my dog,I have a jack russell and he loves to pull us along on walks. This collar didn't phase him. He still pulls. But then it is not a surprise given his breed. It probably would work on a different breed of dog.
1,Training collar,Garbage. Dog ate it in half an hour. Material that leash hooks up to and that tightens collar made out of cheap stuff. My dog is only 15 lbs and he destroyed it in no time at all.
5,Good Correction Collar,"This collar was recommended to me by my dog trainer. I would not recommend using it unless you understand how it is supposed to be used, as misuse would be bad for your dog and probably make his behavior/pulling worse. The product itself is great, I've used it twice a day every day for several months now and have no complaints!"
4,Star Mark Collar,This training collar is working well for my puppy who resisted strongly with the halter type collars. She is responding so much better without the struggle on my part. I only wish it were a bit easier to put on and off.
3,It's a Pop Tart,"Bought these too late at night to really think about it.My son loved the chocolate side, in fact he tried to eat JUST the chocolate side. I ate the vanilla side in order to eliminate the Pop Tart pieces piling up in the kitchen, tough job, but someone had to do it.It's a Pop Tart, you know, just a Pop Tart."
5,I recommend this to everyone,"I just recently read this book, and I think it is very good, especially for those of non-Rom blood who would like some basic information. The author is himself Rom, so this is not written ""about"" Gypsies, but actually by one. I was very glad to see that, and was the reason that I picked it up in the first place. The book doesn't (and can't) go into very much detail about particular cultural practices, etc, and that was my only disappointment with it."
5,Excellent Book,"Great book, very good for introducing people to the culture and history of Rromani people. I think this book and GYPSY LAW, by Walter O. Weyrauch should be required reading for all Legal and Law enforcement people dealing with Rromani people. Really valuable information that could help cut down stereotypes, misunderstandings between Rromani's and local community leaders."
5,kaulupono,"this 3rd CD by these hawaiian young men shows a versatility often exhibited by artists with many more years of performing behind them. the variety of songs shows their ability to do well in genres other than hawaiian music, however, it is apparent that their first ""love"" is hawaiian music. the varied arrangements allow for a myriad of emotions, evidence that much thought was put into each rendition. an excellent project!!"
3,Entertaining by default,"I found this one of the weaker episodes. This one still featured the goodies you come to expect from""Buck"",Wilma Deering and her jump suit, Gil Gerard creakily completing martial arts moves,thatlittle robot guy and the contrasting of 25th century Earth with 20th Century Earth. But there was no atomosphere. Vampire stories demand a certain amount of gloom and creepiness, thats one thing that makes them fun and its also the one thing this episode lacks. At least the set lights could have been dimmed. Any Buck is good Buck, but this one disappointed me a little because I expected better."
4,"Despite it's flaws, still an engaging read","I can't disagree with some reviewers who said it felt unfinished or somehow lacking. It did, but it's only slightly longer than 200 pages, so while if I'd read a 600 page book and felt that way, that would be more of a problem.Overall, I think Wilson had a story in mind, and largely he told it and told it well, as he always does.If your new to Wilson, this might not be the best book of his to start with. I've read about half of his books so far and Spin is by far my favorite so far.Still, I enjoyed this book and definately recommend it to anyone that's already read his other books and liked them."
2,What??!!,"Sam, I'm with you. I kept reading and reading, hoping to find out what the lost teachings were. Maybe they're shrouded in mystery same as the Bible. I began to think maybe I wasn't enlightened enough to receive these teachings, but I what a misguided thought. There IS a lot of rambling in this book; very few concise concepts to latch on to. Wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing the book. Sorry to say, I'm on to the next read with a heavy dose of disappointment in this one."
5,AN ADVENTUROUS TRIP TO A FABLED TIME IN OUR NATIONAL PASTIME,"WHERE HAVE YOU GONE JOE DIMAGGIO? THIS IS THE SEASON OF JOE'S STREAK, TED WILLIAMS BATTING .400, THE DODGERS WINNING THE PENNANT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 21 YEARS,AND THE UNITED STATES ON THE BRINK OF ENTERING THE WAR. I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS TRANSPORTED BACK TO OUR LAST YEAR OF INNOCENCE AND EBBETS FIELD ALL IN THE SPACE OF ONE EVENING. THIS BOOK IS MORE THAN JUST BASEBALL IT IS HISTORY AS SEEN BY A YOUNG MAN WHO HAS PASSIONS AND LOVES THAT HE RETAINS EVEN 50 YEARS LATER. HE ALSO GIVES THE APPROPRIATE CREDIT TO KENNY KELTNER AND THE REST OF THE CLEVELAND INDIANS FOR PUTTING A STOP TO THE MOST FAMOUS STREAK IN ALL OF SPORT."
5,"In a word, ""Fantastic""",All I can say is that I loved this book. Got it at a rummage sale. Creamer is excellent and if you are into baseball history this book will be hard to put down!
2,Younger Scotto Better,"If you want Scotto as Butterfly, then purchase her earlier EMI set with Barbarolli. Her voice was fresher, her Pinkerton (Bergonzi) more luminous, her Sharpless (Panerai) the finest on any set, and her conductor (Barbarolli) more lyrical and sensitive. In this set Scotto's voice has lost much of her velvet and she compensates by adding annoyingly artificial ""touches"" to her interpretation. Domingo sounds fine, but delivers a rather faceless interpretation (he could be singing Don Jose for all I can tell). Wixell is intelligent, but gritty. Maazel is simply dull. Besides, the EMI is less expensive and more lovingly recorded. Why settle for second best? Purchase the Barbarolli."
5,A Novel with a Lot of Heart,"The reader is quickly drawn into a well-written story of believable characters and situations. ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" is inspirational and touching."
2,You get what you pay for...,"We knew this would be poor quality because of the price. We would never use to cut threads, but do use it to clean rusty threads, which is what my husband wanted it for. Thanks, Kim"
5,beautiful music by a beautiful voice,I am replacing the record with this CD. There are times that I relax to this music and feel inspired.
5,Richard Tucker's KOLNIDRE,Richard Tucker is one of my favorite tenors. I found his rendition very moving. Playing the CD while driving to my temple helped to set the mood for the most solom day in the Jewish religious calandar
1,The Dreamer,"A good book to turn you on if you like explicit sex, repetition,and very little plot. I class it with Harlequin Romances, and I am sorry I bought the two others. Books where the men are Gods and the women Godesses, with a story where one hates the other then falls madly in love, are bo-o-o-o-ring."
4,Canvas paints a picture of hardcore metal to come,"Hailing from Manchester, England, this CD has finally made it over the pond to those of us in North America. Blending piercing hardcore screams with some of the most chaotic music in the extreme metal scene, this collection of Canvas' early work is a sure hit, easily blowing away all of the nu-metal scene and their claims to being a blend of hardcore and metal."
3,Great content - bad facsimile.,This book is frustratingly hard to read. It needs to be re-typeset - a new edition. Or maybe someone should just transcribe it somewhere online...
5,Worth having,This is a really useful book. Although a fan of the internet and an EFL teacher I could never quite work out the best ways to use the net to help my students. This book is full of practical and workable ideas. It opens up a whole new resource for teachers. You don't have to be a computer whizz either!
4,Really not a bad cartoon,"I'm not a kid, I just didn't want to reveal my account. Anyway, on with my review.I was expecting one of those weird, crazy cartoons ( like the latest cartoons on Cartoon Network ) when I bought this set, but I was plesantly surprised. True, Quack Pack falls short when compared to the old classics like Duck Tales and Bugs Bunny, but when compared to later cartoons like The Grim adventures of Billy and Mandy, it's actually ok, even intelligent. It's about Huey, Dewey, and Louie as older boys living with their Uncle Donald.The intro music is heavy rock and roll, but it's cute. The character drawings and backgrounds are beautifully done, definately better quality than later cartoons. The stories are pretty slapstick, but again they're cute and well done.While not the best cartoon series, I would recomend Quack Pack to disney fans or babysitters."
2,Still Holding Out For A Boxed Set,"I just want to say thank-you for that review. Ever since I bought the three Quack Pack tapes about a year or two ago, I have been anxiously waiting for the series to come out on DVD (I missed this cartoon when it originally aired.)Seeing as how there are only three episodes on this first volume, I think I will go ahead and either continue to wait for a more comprehensive set or just try to catch them the next time they air on Toon Disney and burn them to DVD myself for my own personal collection.Still, I could eventually buy this DVD if I find it cheap enough locally, since I don't yet have these three episodes. But, it is not a high priority for me now."
1,How the Mighty House of Mouse have Fallen,"Disney was known for its film animation for many years. The beginnings of its TV animation was Chip & Dale Rescue Rangers, Ducktales and Tailspin.This begins up to Quack Pack. Huey, Dewey and Louie, Donald Duck's nephews, are now teens and not as cute as they were in Ducktales. These pint size ducky Jonny Quests seem out of tneir league. This seem like recycled Duck Tales without wise old Uncle Scrooge.There is little or no character developement and most of the situation seem so far out, it makes little of no senseThos DVD has only three episodes and there are no extras. This is the worst TV animation Diney studios have done...if you buy this, you been warned!Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
5,Works exactly as expected,"The needle style probes are perfect for electronics work. Also fit into sockets on DB9, DB25 ... connectors. Worth the price of the whole kit just for these.The alligator clips are too bulky to be much use for electronics work, but are OK for heavier work."
1,A dreadful product,I bought this camera specifically for the zoom capability. That was fine. Pictures are clear. The trouble with this camera is the On and OFF switch. Sometimes it works..sometimes not. Higher altitude at times cause the problem but even at 200 feet above sealevel it doesn't work.The film has gotten caught up at times and won't auto rewind or wind with new film. I say buy a camera that you know is reliable. I since have bought a Canon Sure Shot 115 and very happy..plus its cheaper.
3,Sequel?,The way this book ended I was expecting to find a sequel. It is very diappointing if there is none. What was the point?!
3,One of the most schizophrenic books I've ever read.,"It shifts around like the author had a series of two or three shorter novellas and found a way to link them all into one story. These extreme twists left me feeling like I had started reading one book and ended up reading a completely different one. I'm all for twists, but this was like eating pudding and finding a layer of yogurt underneath.Very little was resolved in this book. A murderer goes free, a drug kingpin and murderer never even comes close to being caught, an author and a senator are paid off to lie and no one ever finds out, and minor characters enter and leave the story seemingly at random."
3,"This is now re-titled ""Go The Distance""","Now available as ""Go The Distance"", this book contains interesting, but generally depressing, short stories ... far from Kinsella's best, but better than average stories."
2,not much help,"As a beginning fiddler I was looking for a good DVD lesson that would teach the basics. Mel Bay has a good reputation for teaching helps. This video is nice to listen to but as for a teaching tool it falls way short of being a help. Mr.Duncan is a good fiddler but does no teaching. He plays many fiddle songs slow speed first then faster. The camera angle is bad and doesn't show good fingering or bow technique. It is, however, a nice compilation of old fiddle tunes for which I gave it two stars."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was disappointed in this book.1. I was hoping for more recipes for wholesome, grainsy breads. The recipes that did interest me used ""malthouse flour"" which is a concoction available only in the United Kingdom, and even if you can find a company which exports it, it would cost all 4 of my appendages!2. Ingredients for recipes are given in metric system, although a conversion is given as well.3. I have had this book for several years and to date have not tried a single recipe!"
5,A must have for new bakers,"I am new to the bread machine and baking. I am a homebrewer so I thought I would try it out. This book came as a recommendation from a friend. I am glad listened. The best part of this book is the explanation of why things happen the way they do and why it's really important to do exactly what the recipe says. As a long time homebrewer I can tell you the margin for error is much more tolerant when making beer. So I needed a book that clear spelled out why a ""pinch of this"" and a ""dash of that"" was not going to work. :)"
1,Waste of Money,"Definitive? Yes, if your a suburban American housewife who knows nothing about cooking bread and just bought a Bread machine at Walmart. Otherwise, nothing new in this book, anything in this book can be found on the internet or from watching Rachel Ray."
2,false advertising,The advertising for this item says the DVD contains two full live shows. The DVD in fact contains only one of the two shows listed on the back cover. The second show listed on the back cover is not on the DVD.The one show on the DVD is a good show. But advertising and marketing it as two full shows is simply a lie.
2,Good intentions but no cigar.............,"Alot of disappointments here, I am afraid. The tracks 'The Council Of Elrond' and 'May It Be' just did not have the same impact they had on the LOTR soundtracks. 'Orinoco Flow' is straight from any department store ""muzac"" soundtrack.Regardles of how avent garde 'Only Time' tries to be I just can't stomach it.I have listened to this CD over and over hoping it would grow on me but, alas, it is going back to Egay from whence it came.On a brighter note let me recommend the CD ""Celtic Woman"" (found elsewhere here on amazon). It contains two Enya tributes, 'May It Be' and 'Orinoco Flow' both songs, as is the whole CD, are excellent!However, I would save your money on ""Thread of Time."""
2,"If you have heard Enya, then stick with the original.","I guess you could call it pretty decent orchestra music - that is, if you have never been introduced to the original Enya music. Which is why I would give it 2.5 stars.If you have, you will feel like saying ... these guys have no right to rip apart and put together this hodge-podge of a music and pretend they are paying a tribute to enya. There's just something dishonest about it. Maybe if they called their CD title ""Music similar to Enya's"" or ""Best of Enya-Like Music"", I might have felt better about it."
3,"Enya's music is beatiful, but there is more out there","This CD was gorgeous with great music, however Enya has a lot more great music out there. If you enjoy Enya, I suggest buying one of her other CD's, or all five. There is no way to compile her five CD's into one without deleting some great music. ""The Best of Enya"" is found all all five."
3,Fast Changes,"Those who are fans of Enya beware, this album is like nothing you have heard from her before. All of the arrangments include the orchestra, but the biggest surprise is the vocals. Enya's trademark is an ethereal voice, and on this album she sounds more like Brittney Spears on several of the tracks. If you are thinking of buying this because you liked her other best of album, Paint the Sky with Stars, you should know that even the familiar songs have been re-vamped, more often than not with a techno beat background. I am keeping the album, but when I want to hear traditional Enya this is not the album that I will turn to. Change is good, but Thread of Time should come with a warning label for those used to traditional Enya."
3,Thread of Time should be Back in Time,"I was expecting a new CD with fresh material from Enya, not a collection of reruns cobbled together from other past hit albums. Two new items are ""The Council of Elrond"" from the ""Lord of the Rings"" smash-hit movie ( a definite stand-alone single but hardly merits buying the CD just for it}and ""Before the Storm"", a mellow tune that complements ""Storms in Africa"". But the remainder of this album does not flow as well as her past material on released CDs. Newbies to Enya's music could do better by purchasing either ""Paint the Sky with Stars"", the only album released to date that could be labeled, ""The Best of Enya"", or any of her other individual CDs. As for me, I'm still waiting for an entirely new, fresh CD of songs from Enya."
3,SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE TECHNO....,"FLUKE IS REALLY A HIT-AND-MISS KIND OF BAND TO ME...THE ONLY THING I WOULD PLAY FROM THIS IS THE MARCO BELLINI MIX, WHICH IS A NICE PROGRESSIVE HOUSE SET BUILDER...FUNKY, LONG, WITH A NICE SYNTH BLEEP HERE AND THERE..."
1,Made me feel strange,"I had high hopes for this for the pain of fibromyalgia. but everytime I took it, I felt like I took a drug. I don't know what was in it that caused it because I have take many of the ingredients before. I was disappointed that i could not use it...especially going to work. I really inhibited my functioning."
1,Very poor results with supreme formula,I used and was very satisfied with FlexProtex the Advanced Formula for Osteoporosis in my fingers.This is no longer made and was replaced by FlexProtex the Supreme Formula.The new formula is so inferior to the previous formula. My Osteoporosis even got worse with the Supreme Formula...Beware!
1,"Really nothing about the product, just about the company","I don't know what to say about the product, since I ordered it off of the TV infomercial on April 7, 2010, and as of today, 3 months later, still haven't received anything. Can't even talk to anyone when calling the number on their website. Just saying that it's a lousy company."
1,Dreadful electric kettle,This electric kettle has none of the following features that are standard on every other electric kettle I have used:1) In case you only want hot water (not boiling) there is no off switch - you have to unplug from the socket to turn off2) No lid - to look inside to see how full3) No clear plastic kettle wall - as an alternative method of looking inside to see how full4) No stand to put it on - so have to unplug from wall if want to move it more than the 3 feet (less actually) the cord allows5) Unless there is a lot of water in it (usually more than I want to boil) it does not click off in a reasonable time - it goes on boiling and boiling.Undoubtedly the worst designed electric product I have ever encountered. PRODUCT SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET. I FIND IT DANGEROUS TO USE. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK.
4,Only basic features,"Although this is a competent product, it is missing some of the nicer features: It doesn't have a cover you can open to see inside it, or clean it, or fill it. (You have to fill it via the opening in the spout, which takes a bit more time.) It doesn't have a window to view the water level; you also can't see how rapid the boiling is, although you can hear it. It doesn't have a switch to turn it off (it stops automatically when it has reached a full boil); you would have to unplug it to stop it prior to its automatic stop. It isn't cordless, so you have to pour it at the location at which it is plugged into the outlet, or unplug it. (The cord isn't very long.)"
1,"Dangerous, badly designed","This kettle has no off switch. I'll say that again: YOU CANNOT TURN IT OFF.I've been using this kettle for 6 months, and I mostly didn't mind it. But it was frustrating how I had to physically unplug it sometimes if I wanted it to stop, since its automatic turn-off feature rarely works. (The plug is a tight fit so it is a lot of effort to plug in and out.)Lately it seems like the auto-off switch has been getting worse and worse. Yesterday I walked into the kitchen and noticed it TURNING ITSELF ON AND OFF, even though I hadn't used it recently. Obviously I immediately unplugged it, and noticed that the power cord was physically hot to the touch, as though the insulation on the cord had been heating.Although it does boil water as advertised, it never STOPS boiling, which seems like a ridiculous requirement for the designers to overlook. I regard this product as dangerously un-trustworthy, and will be throwing it away. A simple hard off-switch would be a big help."
3,Product arrived in good shape but does not fit,Product does not fit my vehicle. Amazon.com's car match link to match parts came up wrong. I have the J hook wiper arms but these have the push pin socket. Now I am stuck with the product until I can give them away.
3,You can lead a cat to...,"The dish is fine - works as advertised & is cleverly designed & operates quietly. The problem is my geriatric cat who couldn't even be tempted to eat from the open tray, never mind once the mechanism was in place. He's 18 & goes through periods of wanting to eat every 3 hours, day or night - a bit rough on those of us who'd like an uninterrupted sleep. So I thought I'd try the auto-feeder. Oh. Well."
4,Useful for short vacations,Works well for long weekend trips. Only holds enough food for a small animal.
5,The Mysterious Bard (or Whomever),"I read Michell's book just before embarking on a 3 week Shakespeare workshop at the reconstructed Globe in London this past summer; intriguing, infuriating, thought-provoking, insightful, Michell's historical and cultural tour of England through authorship gives the reader a chance to make us his own mind, quite unlike most other authorship books. A bit tedious at times, but certainly not lacking details and impeccable research."
3,The Great Debate,"Did William Shakespeare write all of those plays and sonnets? That is certainly the conventional story. But, there are problems with that version, as there are problems with all of the alternative theories examined in this fascinating book. William Shakespeare was an actor and the owner of a theater. The only thing that connects him to his plays is his name at the top of them, which is fairly strong evidence.This book examines the many alternate theories. Possible identities of the true authors include Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere (Earl of Oxford, William Stanley (Earl of Derby), Roger Manners (Earl of Rutland and Christopher Marlowe.The theory behind the possibility that Shakespeare stole other's works has problems. But this theory also has surprising evidence in its favor.Most likely it is a mystery never to be solved. But it certainly makes for a good armchair debate."
1,Non-Linear reasons... and opinions presented as facts.... horrible....,"The author of this book needs to take a lesson or two in logic and reasoning. He uses non-linear logic to prove the Bible is supernatural. He also blatantly states opinions as facts. Only a brainwashed feeble minded soul could take this book seriously.I agree with many that The Bible is the great source of knowledge. God is our creator, and Jesus is our backbone of morality. So I am not some liberal atheist just starting trouble here.I had some doubts about the ""supernatural"" aspect of the Bible, and someone suggested I read this book.This book is flawed at best. His reasoning and justifications are so laughable I feel bad for the people who read it and agree with them.Regarding the author himself..... I have no doubts his passion for Christ and the faith is genuine, and his moral character is most likely respectable and admirable.However, this book does little convince any skeptic about the ""supernatural"" nature of the Bible."
2,Not so great,I got this teapot with great excitement and was very happy with it when it came. However the enamel around the rim began to crack and chip only after three four uses with gentle hand wash. I returned it and don't think of getting a new one. For some reason I was not convinced that this fault was specific to the one I got.
4,"Mexican review for ""Introduction to Transportation System""",It's very important all the concept that shows this book because it helps to understand a lot of important concepts we use at the transport master degree
2,They can't hold the umbrellas!,"This Polly Pocket set is very cute, but the people cannot hold the umbrellas! When I finally get one settled on their hand, it only takes about 3 seconds for it to fall off. The umbrellas are heavy for the tiny dolls and the dolls' hands are not formed to hold the umbrella handle. It is disappointing because I think that it's a good idea but poorly executed. My girls play with the dolls but not the umbrellas."
3,Flawed but essential,"What can you do? The text itself has no answers to the practice questions, many of which are not really straightforward. The solutions manual has a number of errors (I've found an average of at least 2 per chapter, and I'm sure I don't catch them all), but for the most part puts you on the right path.The text is nearly useless without the solutions manual, so I guess you need this; read carefully and think deeply when an answer doesn't make sense -- it may be you, or it may be the manual.I can't believe Brealey had much to do with this book -- it suffers from the sloppiness you'd expect from an underpaid grad student. Based on my experiences in grad school, I'd bet most of my net worth that Brealey had little to do with the actual writing of the ""solutions"" here."
4,Book practically useless withouth it,Essential if you are trying to learn on your own. The text book does not come with soluitions to problems so this solutions manual is essential. Did not give it the full 5 starts becasue I have seen a couple of calculation errors.
3,review from a real user,There are several mistakes on the solutions of the textbook. The most of the exersises they are not explained with enough detail. In some cases there is not correct matching with the exersises of the book. However it is a useful help to study the book
1,way slow delivery,USPS took 3 1/2 weeks to deliver. Pay for the extra shipping to get product in a timely manner.
2,CUTE BUT THATS ABOUT IT,"This is a cute book full of little tidbits of information that really do nothing more than amuse yourself. Most of the excuses in the book will never work for anybody. There are some tips and a few excuses that the author makes reference to that may help you but overall, I was disappointed with the book. The cartoons are funny and cute. It was well put together also. Sorry I could not be very helpful with a recommendation but its not worth it.Thanks."
1,Memorex drops the ball,"I bought this at Target. I can't return it, as the 90 days elapsed whiled waiting to give it as a Christmas present. oops. Now I'm stuck with a unit that doesn't work at all. It won't power up. It won't even charge. It's a dud, and Memorex knows it. A lot of companies will send a replacement immediately and request that you then return their item in that box, NOT MEMOREX. Their tech support isn't toll free, and takes about 45 minutes to get someone, anyone. Then there's no guarantee that they'll speak english. This was a bad day for a frustrated consumer. Don't buy this. You'll be sorry. Memorex didn't pull these when they knew they were defective, so, they're all defective. You probably won't find a good one.buy ANY other mp3 player."
4,Great for iPhone,"I'm not a big fan of the bluetooth earpieces (for a variety of reasons I won't go into now), so I looked around for a cool iPhone compatible headset with a microphone. The great thing about this is that not only can you answer calls with the button, but you can also use the button to activate the iPod aspect of your iPhone. Sound quality is surprisingly good. Buds stay in my ears and block out a lot of ambient noise. I drive a very noisy old Land Cruiser, and I can hear just fine -- and people can hear me! The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it plugs into my iPhone with an adapter (included), which works just fine, but adds a little bit of unnecessary business to the whole contraption."
2,Can't hear,"I bought this to use with my enV (LG VX9900) and the volume of the earpiece was unacceptably low. The volume on the phone itself is really good at the lowest setting. With the earpiece, however, just sitting at home I had to put the volume up half way just to hear the person I was talking to. If I was in the car I'd have to turn it all the way up and I really had to concentrate on listening. However, no one ever complained about not being able to hear me or hear me clearly."
5,Unlocking the Mysteries of Creation,"I am so impressed with this book!! I plan on giving as many copies as possible to family and friends. In this age of diminishing the omnipotence of God, this beautifully illustrated, well organized, and thought provoking volume has stirred our minds and inspired our faith. It would fascinate middle school through adult ages with the two-page topic format, becoming a springboard for further investigation. This book is indeed awesome!!!"
1,Out dated arguements,"This is not a good book concerning facts. It also uses outdated material, speculative ideas, and does not back up claims with good science. It also does not utilize peer reviewed information. There are plenty of good creation books and literature available, but this is not one of them. Any evolutionist will chew this up."
4,Mysterys no more,"Wonderful book full of information, that is great for any one. Hight quality photos and well flowing text. The only thing I would say is that the language used is a bit large for children most likely to age 10. I often have to re-word things so that my child will underdtand teh verbage. Even with that said, this is a must buy for use as a science companion, espically if home schooling. Or for any one seeking truth about the amazing world in which we live."
1,"CHRISTIANS, PLEASE DON'T BE STUPID!","There are many useful creationist resources out there, but this is not one of them! I picked up this book at my mother-in-law's place, and couldn't believe what I was reading. This is possibly the single worst creationist book in existence. This book is EXACTLY what evolutionists think of when they claim creationism is ridiculous. I am amazed at all the five-star reviews this book is getting. I know those reviews are coming from people who don't care whether the book makes any sense, they just want to feel like they are being faithful. I'm begging you, as a Christian, to not read this book, much less show it to friends. We have embarrassed ourselves enough! Instead take a look at credible creation science resources like AnswersInGenesis.org. If you want to show that Creationism is a real possibility, stay away from this mess!"
3,Um...,"Not the book that I thought it would be. It does have good photos. The information, however, is really nothing new, mysterious or exciting."
1,This book is absolutely dreadful....and I'm a creationist!!!,"Before you even dream of purchasing this book, be advised thateven Answers in Genesis Ministries, the Institute for Creation Research, and the Creation Research Society are in disagreement with most of the book. This book does NOT represent the creationist position, and is filled with a lot of bogus stuff...."
5,Gordon Adds to Speaking Body of Knowledge,Gordon adds a new level of sophistication to speaking skills. This is a fine addition to anyone's speaking library.
2,Cheap stuff. Not recommended,"It got me off-line like every 30 minutes. Plus it breaks down when you are downloading at a higher speed, say, 500kb/s. Not good user interface too. Anyway, you cannot expect much from such a router. Not recommended, especially for Windows 7."
2,Not that great,After installing this item I have been unable to get wireless to actually work on my laptop. The included software doesn't have any way to customize installation and it appears to operate at a very warm temperature which probably means it will have a short life.
1,dont buy,"first it has problems 10 feet away wireless, constantly going offline and online. I have had it two months and have not had 5 straight days that I haven't had to fix something. You are forced to buy the software that comes with it to use any features, what comes with it is a trial version and when it expires you get some features but non stop nag screens and I suspect malware...amazon, I'm veru disapointed your write up did not mention this. I will not buy the software, I will buy another router and count this as a lesson learned. This is the worst product I ever bought from amazon."
3,ME HA SALIDO MUY BUENO ESTE ROUTER,"ES UN BUEN PRODUCTO, SOLO TIENE UN PROBLEMITA QUE YA LO HABIA LEIDO DE OTROS USUARIOS. DE MOMENTO, Y COMO A LOS DOS MESES DE USO O MENOS, CUANDO SALIAMOS CON LA LAPTOP A OTRO LUGAR Y VOLVIAMOS A USARLO EN LA CASA, RECHAZABA LA CONECCION. RESULTA QUE CUANDO LE PONES LA SEGURIDAD, NO TE DEJA CONECTAR TUS PROPIAS COMPUTADORAS, ESO SE DANA. LO RECOMENDABLE ES QUE LE CONFIGURES LAS DIRECCIONES MAC DE CADA COMPUTADORA QUE DESEES Y NO PERMITAS QUE NADIE MAS SE CONECTE. DE ESTA FORMA EVITAS QUE PERSONAS CON ANTENAS PARA COJER TU SENAL Y BAJEN TU VELOCIDAD. TUVIMOS EL PROBLEMA HASTA QUE UN EXPERTO NOS EXPLICO LO DE LAS DIRECCIONES MAC. PERO EN GENERAL, FUERA DE ESE PROBLEMA, AUN LO ESTAMOS USANDO, HA RESULTADO."
2,This thing doesn't stay connected,"I got one of these for my office. I must say I would not rely on it for critical business applications. My web page loads routinely freeze up and I find that I have to repeatedly hit the 'refresh' button for the entire page to load. Even though the connection is reported as ""excellent"" I find that my downloads are often stopped in the first 100Mb, or I have to hit the refresh button to load the page as stated above. All in all it's usable for the most basic wireless internet access, but if I could exchange it right now I would."
4,"Inexpensive, functional router that can be fussy at times","For the price, you can't beat this router and its features, but beware, you WILL have to reset this thing relatively frequently by unplugging it for 30 seconds and plugging it back in. While it doesn't take that long, it can be annoying and is unpredictable - sometimes it is necessary two or three times in one day, other times you can go 2 or 3 weeks without having to do it. It does everything a more expensive router would, yet its reliability and quality leaves something to be desired. However, for the price, I would still recommend it."
4,trendnet router,"This is a great product, easy to set up, easy plug and play design, This product was nicely packaged and arrived quickly, I would recommend this to anyone and it was such a great price too."
4,Wireless Router,"Works as advertised. The firmware had to be updated for a correction of a calender issue. Once performed, the unit worked as advertised."
2,Wireless routers are apparently not all the same...,"Having used wireless routers for several years, we thought they would be commoditized when we went to buy a new one about a year ago, and so bought the cheapest one (this Trendnet). I think we continue to use it to network two laptops to the internet just to see how much frustration we can take. Our laptops work fine when on campus and at friends' houses, but at home the wireless frequently drops even when in the same room as the router, and every 2-4 days, the wireless will totally cease to work, not allowing any wireless connectivity whatsoever until the router is rebooted.Might have gotten a poor model. Wired connectivity works as expected, so not 1 star.(The wireless just dropped in the time it took me to write this review. ""Repaired"" the connection in WinXP in order to post. I think we're going to get a Linksys WRT router very, very soon.)"
1,"Awful, awful router","If it were free this router would be overpriced. The signal is weak. It frequently locks up. It can't consistently fiqure out the current time. The management console is horrible. As my laptop would be turned off and on it wouldn't be allowed to reconnect to the router until I restarted the router. Almost impossible to get good connection speeds unless you are sitting right in front of it.The worst ""bargain deal"" I ever got. I've since replaced it with a D-Link MIMO router and it just works. With the trendnet roututer I was constantly forced to go to the router and pull the plug to restart it.Avoid it."
2,Geez,"I bought this router months ago, and while it does send out a strong wireless signal, it frequently drops. I don't have to restart the router, it restarts itself... but where it really bothers me is with online games... I get booted from the server in the middle of a game.. It's terribly annoying, and random.Also, I thought I was getting a good deal with the rebate and all, but they never sent me my rebate and act like I never sent them anything at all. Big scam, inferior product. If I could get my money back and do it again, I'd shell out a bit more for a linksys or something else."
4,Good Little Router,"Cheap router, good download speeds, basic functions.I'm using this router with my DSL PPOE connection. Initial setup was a breeze until I kept receiving an error message from the provided install disk (which proved worthless for setting up a wireless connection). A call to customer service as well as info gathered from other reviews lead me to page 26 of the Quick Start Manual where under Q2 you can find all the info to the web configuration page and setup a WAP password. After configuring the web setup page, everything was a breeze.Download speeds are about the same as my Linksys Wireless Router. I've only had this unit for a day now, but so far so good. I will update this review if any major changes happen."
3,cheap but hard to install,it's hard to install if your using win 7. you must update router's firmware first. It takes time.after that it works.
2,Bare essentials... Best for an unsecured network...,"I thought I'd try to scrape by with the cheapest router, thinking ""it'll do the job."" But when I tried using it for the first time, I was met with an obnoxious firmware/interface that requires 15 seconds restarts between setting changes. On top of that, for some odd reasons, certain security settings just didn't work. WEP and 128 bit WPA didn't play nice with my Macbook, and MAC Address filtering didn't work with my HP laptop.And now, a month into its life, past the return period, it cuts out periodically and requires a hard reset to get working again.Trendnet makes good products... like KVM switches. This isn't one of their better productsMy advice to you is to buy from a name brand company who has better resources to test their products before shipping. Setting up a network should ""just work."" This fails that mark."
4,"It works, and it is blazing fast.","However, and I'm not sure if it is to be expected, but every so often my laptop does not detect the internet through the router automatically and I have to unplug and replug the power to the router."
3,works well but setup needs a lot to be desired,Compared to a linksys router this one was a little harder to setup. I had to call support to get it going. The security was different and it comes with a utility that is more of a hinderance than a help. Once I got it going it works like a champ. Only other negative is that for some reason my powerline adapters are not getting the speed they were getting with linksys.
5,Improved my home wireless network,"I had an 802.b wireless router I had configured as a gateway connected to comcast cable. My wireless devices were very slow with the .b router even though the best cable speed I got was only 1.5 meg and .b is 11 meg. I thought going to 802.g might fix the problem. The arithmetic, and my son, said no but this router solved my problems. Wireless devices now run as if directly connected. I don't know for sure if it was .g or this device but all devices (palm TX, Wind MSI notebook, Mini Mac) work great. Easy setup, lots of security options, and low price put this item on top for me."
1,Cheap PoC,This router is slow and unstable and I had DHCP IP-address issues with it (both wired and wirelessly and with both Windows XP and Vista). The price is right but you definitely get what you pay for with this PoC. Save yourselves some heartache and get the Linksys WRT54GL (and load Tomato). This thing was nothing but trouble (mine was hardware revision D1.1R and came with the latest firmware (v3.00 build 0028)). I have since returned it.
1,Terrible Router,"First of all, the word ""Wireless Router"" was suppose to be lit up by a orange light on this router, but only the word ""Router"" was lit up since the first day I received it. Second, this router's wireless signal frequently drops, so I have to do the power cycle all the time. I know Trendnet router is cheap compare with other brands such as Linksys and Belkin, but if you are looking forward to have a pleasant wireless experience, please do not purchase this product. Just spend few more bucks on the brand that can be trusted, and you will never regret."
3,all right and cost efficient,"It was easy to set up when I did not choose to enable security features. But be sure to read the manual if you have no wireless router setup experiences.However, it seemed to me WEP (wired equivalent privacy) did not work. I had to choose WPA-PSK, which is technically a better choice. It was very painful for me to set it up. I eventually had to upgrade all my wireless adapter's driver and configuration utility, and give up Microsoft's wireless zero configuration. I often need to restart the router to get connection.So far I have not been able to identify that it was a problem of the wireless adapters or a problem of the router. But if you do have some knownledge of wirless networking, I would recommend you it because it is quite cheap after all."
2,Cannot get this product set up.,"I received this router today and have spent 3 hours trying to get it set up to no avail. Mine did not come with a ""EasyGo"" CD that everyone is talking about, so I was having to just guess at everything I was doing.I have never had this much trouble setting up a router before. Not to mention the company's website didn't offer any kind of help whatsoever except for what was in the ""quick"" installation guide.I do no recommend this product."
5,Very good product,I have two of these and they work great. I would never purchase a Netgear router again because they are over priced and impossible to set up without tech support. These TRENDnet routers and inexpensive and fairly straight forward to set up. This is a sound investment.
2,Its not a value for money,I am missing cable with this item. Speed is not good. I tried with 3 different laptop and still got the same speed. I won't recommend anyone to buy this item from this seller.
2,WAN light turns off (and internet stops working) when i touch the device,"This device is brand new, i just opened it and installed it yesterday 11/6/2010.Unfortunately, the WAN light is very instable. when I move or pick up the device, the WAN light goes off. sometimes the WAN light comes back on, other times i have to squeeze the device or tap it a bit to make the WAN light come back on. if i get the WAN light on, and dont' touch it, i can access the internet without a problem.however if move it to plug in another wire for example, the WAN light will go off and may not come back on untill i fiddle with the device for a while.i've just submitted a helpdesk ticket on trendnet website, and we'll see what they say. has anyone else have this issue before?"
3,My experience with TRENDnet 54 Mbps Wireless Router,"Great Price, easy setup, good security features. However, during the past week (some 20 days after I installed it), we had to reset the router twice. I don't know if it's because the router shut itself down because of security as it may have been that someone had tried to get into my network by trying to break the passcode too many times causing the router to stop working; or that simply the router went wondered off. If it's the latter, then, the router is not reliable. We just got tired of resetting it, so, we're using straight from my modem to our computer."
1,terrible router,terrible router!!Need to restart almost everyday!Otherwise it just loses internet connection.Even my 8 years old belkin does a better job than this piece of junk!Don't buy this unless you don't mind getting kicked off online fromtime to time.
3,no vpn,Its an OK router. Unfortunately VPN connection does not work through this router. Also occasionally the router will lose its connection to the internet and I have to unplug the power for a second and it comes back.
1,Do not buy!,"I ordered this router on November 26th, I got it shortly thereafter, it's now December 30th (barely), I came home from work and I have no wired or wireless connectivity. All the lights on the router are on, I hooked my cable modem directly into my PC and it works fine, I plug the router back in and nothing happens. All the lights on the router light up like it's working, but still no internet access. I tried my old non-wireless router, and it also works fine, so all of my cables work also, this thing just died after a month of use tops.Even when it was ""working"" at least once an hour it would just cut out for 2 - 3 minutes and then come back on, which needless to say is majorly annoying as I play a lot of games online on my PC and Xbox, and I was using a wired connection not the wireless, the wireless connections didn't have this issue.Hopefully I'm still in time to get my money back for this piece of crap."
3,Not a reliable product,"This router often stops working, especially when there are more than one computers connecting to the router. Then I have to reboot it. It is quite annoying."
5,Works great,"Had a problem hooking up to my Imac, but a call to Trendnet had everything working in minutes..."
1,Horrible router,"The firmware is bad, the range is awful, It loses connection a lot. Its just really bad. On top of that Amazon had 2 rebates with it which was the only reason I bought it, and the rebates did not work. Both required the original UPC. Mad in Ohio with a crappy router. The only plus with this router is that is really small."
1,Bad Tech Support,I was trying to setup my new router and had to call Trendnet Tech Support. The tech was really really rude and not helpful at all. I am still trying to figure out how to set it up own my own and am really frustrated.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This is my sixth DSL wireless router or should I say was to be my sixth DSL router.I bought this DSL router as a backup to my Zoom ADSL router. I connected the router, typed in the address, entered the information using the wizard. It would not connect, I did this for eight or more times. The router then decided that it had had enough and that I wasn't going to bother it any more; even using the reset I could not connect to it again.I thought that I would take the cheap route for a backup router, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT NO STARS, BUT ONE STAR WAS AS LOW AS YOU COULD GO."
1,bad company,TRENDnet 54Mbps Wireless G Broadband Router ( TEW-432BRP Version D1.0R)i spent 5hrs with this company getting the type and models for setting a wireless printer lan after spending over $400.00 on items they said i would need. and waiting for over a week to recieved items it would not set up.i have been working in computers since 1978 and have taught them in hs and coll. I talked to there tech people for about 4 hours it boiled down to the items would not work with windows vista or window 7 they had no ambission to get it ceterfied in any future. they also would not take items back. becareful what you hear from them they will do anything to make a sale
3,I bought 12 of these routers and 2 went bad so far,"I bought 12 of these routers and 2 went bad so far, and if one more of my these routers I bought goes bad then these are not reliable. Also I noticed some of the routers are have only up to 2008 year even with the latest firmware"
2,Junk not working with comcast broadband,I purchased this router thinking it would solve my wireless problem. Unfortunatly it has not. The router is working but I am not able to setup wireless. I spent hours with customer care and they were also not able to figure out what's going on eventhough they said that router is compitible with comcast broadband. I can user in wired form so it is junk for me.If you have comcast broadband then make sure before purchasing.
1,It's not working with comcast broadband !,I updated it to last firmware.But it still failed to get the IP from Comcast cable modem.I am a engineer working in Hi-Tech over 8 years and this is the worse router I have ever purchased.I already returned it to amazon.
5,Simple inexpensive,I purchased a couple of these TRENDnet routers for not only myself customers but customers. This router have been simple and easy to set up. Has a small footprint and a decent WiFi range. I even keep one of these in stock because it's so cheap if something goes wrong with another WiFi...I can easily put this WiFi in and be up and running again quickly.
3,at the end is good,"This router is no so good at the beginning, it comes with a really old firmware that was disconnecting the only one laptop around it every 10 minutes, I had to update and know is working as advertised."
1,Wireless problems,"I bought this router based on the overall good reviews and low price. I was never able to get the wireless to work reliably with security. Re-reading the reviews here, I assumed I had a bad unit and returned it to Amazon and they sent a new one. The new one has the same exact problem. My configuration is two Windows 7 32-bit laptops, and using WPA2 wireless security. Wired connections work great. Wireless connections work sometimes, but most of the time do not work. I am returning my second unit and will buy a different router. I have had good luck with D-Link in the past, so will go back to them even though the price is significantly higher."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this as a Black Friday special to replace a Linksys Wireless B router. I didn't need to but it was cheap so I did.Pros:-Setup was very simple; much easier than the Linksys router. The CD walks any user through the process, regardless of that individual's IT expierience.-The signal is very strong; I can connect to this router with full strength from anywhere within my apartment (approximatley 800 sq. feet).Cons:-Singal constantly drops or locks up. I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes.To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it. When that happens, I will most likely go with another Linksys product as Linksys has never given me an issue."
4,Fantastic and inexpensive,"I have owned this for about 4 years. It has been very reliable. I am considering upgrading to a faster model, but it just works so well."
5,Better Than It Was Before,"I had this Trendnet router back in 2007 til the present(2012). I moved and liked its compatibility and durability so much I purchased this same exact brand a little over a month ago to use with my brand new desktop. The bonus was that it wasn't just the exact same one, but an upgraded version! An example I will give is that this router has the quick/easy access of the WPS button. Great G router for my home because it simply does its job. Yes, in my opinion this G router is as good as any N router. Whether I'm gaming, streaming videos or music from my pc to my HDTV or have guest over who want wireless internet access.. there are NO issues.. and at a bargain price I'm glad I ordered this router AGAIN."
3,VERY CHEAP....,I have had alot of problems with this router (The ROuter constantly Conflicts with another IP Adress and goes out rather frequently and randomly)... It is the best buy if you are on a budget like me and you just need something that connects and you don't mind having fun replacing IP Adresses and turning on and off the router. I actually kind of like repairing the internet service (It makes me feel needed in the household) and Since Im the computer tech of the house I do all the work with the computers and the networking so Its not really a problem) I read that this was a piece of crap before I bought it but its not crap if you can go on the internet a portion of the day lol but it is a hassle to work with and if you dont have the time to deal with a router messing up on you I DONT ADVISE getting this router. (Paying for quality)....
4,Very satisfied,"Had a little bit of frustration with set-up, but that may have been due to user error :)Otherwise, very satisfied with it. No problems with the signal dropping out, although I don't ever need to use it any further away than the next room."
1,Item ordered but not shipped,"So bad that the item was shipped, but not received by me. Amazon refund the money back."
4,Great for the money,"The set-up tools weren't the easiest to navigate, but after clicking around for a few minutes it was relatively simple to figure out. The wizard didn't load properly for me at first either.Otherwise has worked beautifully, very reliable, and strong signal; admittedly I'm only covering a 1-bdrm apartment, though. Handles multiple devices seamlessly. Great value for the money."
1,Poor device,"I bought two units (one for my sister), and both of them need to be fixed.support told me to send it to them, so I need to pay now for the shipment, more than the device worth..."
2,Bad signal,The signal produced is very unstable. Finally i had to give up with the wireless and instead used a cable...
1,You need to be a computer geek to set up the security,"I got my new router. The instructions were confusing, . They used alot of abbreviations assuming everyone knows what they mean. I had to call my ISP (internet service provider) to get help. If you are not used to computer lingo you would say what is ISP . After 3 hours and the help of a magnifying glass ( the instruction book was made for someone with amazing eye sight.) I got the router set up but could not secure the connection. I couldn't understand the abbreviations for the security instructions and finally gave up. I sent it back and put some duck tape on my old secure easy to use router ,set it up and decided not to replace it after all."
2,You get what you pay for,"The price is great. It was very easy to set up and it works well with a wired connection. Although, I bought it because I need a reliable wireless connection. I am constantly losing my connection with this router."
1,"works for a while, then drops connection AVOID","When I bought this, I was pleased and recommended it to a friend. After a few weeks, it started dropping the connection. At first just a few times a week, then daily, then several times a day, finally every few minutes. I even installed a firmware update from Trendnet. Worked fine for about half a day, then started dropping the connection. My friend had similar experiences. Judging from other reviews (give it a few weeeks before you give it a final review) the device is defective. Buy something else."
4,Good piece. Never had any problem,I used this piece for a while now. I never had any problem setting it up. It does annoy sometimes. It would not recognize the network unless restarted. I faced that problem thrice in 1 year. Thats no big deal though.Good for the price and lot of help available online. I could fix the network issues browsing. The steps are simple and easy to understand. I recommend this product.ThanksAG
2,Loses connectivity over short time,"I've had routers that last 6+ years. This one has made it maybe 1-2. It replaced the same one previously which had the same problem. Our local internet provider rents these out which is why I keep getting them. I'm just going to buy one outright now. These seem to drop connections, both wired and wireless, much too soon in it's life."
3,Inexpensive router but ...,This wireless router was a cinch to set up and the functionality is on par with other devices. The main problem I have with the router is the fact that it looses connectivity with my cable modem on a regular basis and I have to do a reset to get it to work again ... not too happy about that ...
1,signal is so incredibly weak it can only be used in the same room!,"This router was priced very well, and I wasn't expecting a lot but I was still very disappointed. The wireless signal is so weak it can only be used in the same room as the router!!! I have a very small house, but I can not use this router at all. I am better off using a 3 foot patch cable if I must be this close to the router. Utterly worthless!"
2,You get what you pay for,"Having been excited initially with such an affordable price for this router, I later realized that the old saying is very much applicable in this case. The router is easy to set up and use. However, it barely broadcasts the signal (10-15 feet max) and the connection drops with enviable regularity (with Comcast modem-every 2-3 days I have to reset the modem and the router)."
5,Works Great,"I have bought two of these routers, the first one I have been using for a couple of years and have not had a problem so I bought another one for a friend and that one works well also. They seem to have good range, and are very easy to set up. The price is also very reasonable for a quality product."
3,Cheap router that does its job,"I bought this router a few years back for $[...] after rebates from CompUSA. Mine is a C1 revision model. I've kept up on firmware updates and tweaked my configuration. I've got 5 wireless devices and 3 wired devices hooked into it. It's worked fine in the past, but now it requires a reboot nearly every day or else it drops the connection speed to dismal levels.I can't complain for the price I paid, but for a more stable and feature-rich router, you'll want to look elsewhere. Perhaps next time I'll buy a router that's compatible with alternative firmwares like DD-WRT, Tomato, or OpenWRT."
2,Weak,"I researched what is available on the market, and this router had all the features I wanted - MAC filtering, WPA password protection, 54 Mbps, can be used as a switch, works with PC and Mac. Trendware offered a nice rebate too. All this is great but when there is a wall between my PowerBook and the router, the reception drops a lot, and sometimes completely. It only works well when they are in the same room. This could be due to the fact that there are other wireless networks around which interfere with mine. I don't know. I thought I would give heads up for those looking for a reliable router."
2,signal keeps fluctuating very often,"had high hopes for this router with the nice menu/configuration options etc, but it keeps fluctuating the signal between hi and lo for no apparent reason....even got a more powerful antenna which didnt help at all.never again a trendnet pos for me..."
4,a refreshing discovery,"a friend lent me this album and a was very pleasently surprised of its delightful content. I was a big fan of British Folk Rock in the 70s and this was very remeniscent of that era, but in an innovative way. Mr. Sedan's compostions are romanticly eerie and captivating as well. The songs are neatly composed and keep the listen entranced through the entire album.I would reccommend this album to any person of sensitive character and an open mind!!!"
1,Misleading product description - Image shows functionality which is impossible with this product,"I recieved this wireless thermometer for christmas, and discovered it has one fatal flaw. In the image shown on this site, the temperature is displayed on the wireless remote section of this - however, that picture is wrong! It is not possible to display the temperature remotely, which makes this pretty useless to me.The remote sensor will beep when the target temperature is reached (or timer hit), but that's all - you can't keep track of the temperature on the remote part.The manufacturer has a number to call which we did, and they said that the pictures (which show the remote sensor displaying the temperature) are wrong.Therefore, I would strongly advise against this product, as there are simmilar priced wireless thermometers which you can view the current actual temperature from the remote device - a very useful feature."
4,Works well...,"I bought this remote mainly because of the price. I'm tired of buying the expensive ones and they only work a couple of months, then die. I have been using this one for a couple weeks and it works well. I have a Traeger bbq and it sits in the carport which is quite a ways from the kitchen. I have had no problem with signal strength between the main unit and the remote as I have had with other brands. I may just order two or three more of these, so when this one breaks I'll have a backup. For this price I could buy eight of them for what I paid for the last brand I bought, it lasted three days past warrenty then stopped recieving a signal. If I get 90 days or so (I use them a lot) out of this thermometer I will count it a win.Nice unit, easy to use and read and you cannot beat the price.Recommend this one."
2,"Misleading Packaging, but works OK","This thermometer does everything the enclosed INSTRUCTIONS say it will do, but when you look at the picture of the product on the packaging, one can clearly see a temperature displayed on the pager unit.The pager unit WILL NOT DISPLAY A TEMPERATURE, only current time, or a timer. If you want a unit with a remote pager that does display temperature remotely, move on. Otherwise, this thermometer does everything it's instructions say it will do - to include the pager beeping when the target temperature is reached. Not a bad choice for the money. Not hard to set-up or operate. The instructions are clear and probably written by someone who grew up speaking English. I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the deliberately deceptive packaging."
5,Fun product!,"Great product for the hard core griller (or the lazy griller), however you want to look at it. We have really enjoyed ours!"
5,"Bond, James Bond--done right","Game music has always had a bad rap. Admittedly, a lot of games music does suck. In his third and latest album Tommy Tallarico has really outdone himself lending his music to a more sophisticated movie-going audience. Let me put it this way: if I didn't know this was video game music I'd instantly assume it was the movie soundtrack. I don't know about you, but I really can't, in all honesty, say the same about 90% of the stuff I hear on my PlayStation. Worth the money, and if you like this one you should hunt down his other CDs."
2,"No,No,NO!","I bought this soundtrack because I thougt it would be fun to have a video-game-soundtrack, and I also hoped that it would be a good CD. It wasn`t. It was really dissapointing. There is only one good song, and that one is nr 2 ""Confrontation"". That song contains a great mix of ""James Bond Theme"" and a new theme. But the rest of the CD is just bad. Track nr 1 ""James Bond Theme"" isn't (unfortunately) good at all, neighter is the las track, which is vocal. This CD is not worth buying if you're not a big Bond-fan. Then may it be fun to have in your record-shelf. But you won't listen to it."
2,the Rough Guide map is WAY better,"The review that says this map is equivalent to one in a guidebook like Lonely Plant is correct. If you need more than the Interamericana, get the Rough Guide map to Costa Rica and Panama. It covers way more roads. If you truly need a map, and we do since we'll be on our touring bikes, this one really doesn't cut it."
4,Worth the $ if you're going to Panama,"After reading so many reivews of travel guides, they all said don't waste the $ on the waterproof map. They must have meant the National Geographic one cause this one is VERY helpful. Only thing better would have been a larger scale map of Panama City (there is an ""insert"" but it is not big enough). Otherwise, it is fine & glad we got it. Also, Amazon has a better price (and free freight) than you can buy it on the manufacturer's website!"
3,Clayton Selestow,I found this map only as useful as a general map of any given state in the USA but not detailed enough to be a true street map of Panama.
3,Panama Map,This map is nice. It gives you a good look at the layout of the country and where everything is. It will give you a general idea of how to get to places. But as far as using it as a road map - forget it. You will discover that finding roads and getting around in Panama is difficult. Roads and signs are not marked very well and this map is certainly a reflection of that.
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"Sequels are always difficult to write: you want to be fresh yet keep your fans satisfied. MacLeod seems to pull a George Lucas, writing the second book of the ""Engines of Light"" series only to fill the gap from the better ""Cosmonaut's Keep"" and the finishing ""Engine City"". I found ""Dark Light"" a bit of a let down; the plot and meat of the story could have been told in half the space, that other half filled with stoddy, dated political explorations...it took me twice as long to read this book than I would have normally, finding myself putting the book down mid-chapter as I lost interest.Another complaint: two of the main characters (and most interesting) also disappear inexplicably from the first quarter of the book, just reappear in the denouement. There is only a throwaway line of where they were and their inactivity through this period was completely out of character.Here's hoping the third and final installment is more of a page-turner."
4,Excellent Middle-of-Trilogy book,"This book was in many ways superior to Cosmonaut Keep, the first in the trilogy. While the first book had good characters, world building and wild speculation, it used an irritating technique to keep key information from the reader. Of course, it was obvious to most of us that one of the main characters was the ancestor of another, and what might likely happen as a result. I was left waiting around for the two plot lines to converge long after I guessed.Dark Light dispenses with the two-track plotting and the concealment of information. It throws in several new worlds and societies, a great big wodge of fascinating political specualtion, and more good character development. It also ends with enough of a kick to keep you going to the next book. Well worth the time, with 50 per cent less frustration."
4,"""Like a ripple in a stream""","Charming, well-written, and often funny, this followup to ""Cosmonaut Keep"" is, umm, lightyears better than its clunky predecessor.Well plotted, with memorable characters and interesting issues, especially about gender (prepare to be challenged), you'll probably get so wrapped up in the multiple POV tale that maybe you'll even forgive the author's goofball politics.So flip a Greatful Dead CD onto the old player, turn on your reading light, open the book, and enjoy!"
4,Will the real socialist please stand up?,"Oh, those Brits! Having to contend with Banks, Reynolds and Mielville isn't enough. We must have this bloke inflicted on us as well. Surprisingly, unlike his earlier work, I have found 'Cosmosnaut Keep' and this volume, the first two in this series to be 'the real thing'. This is surprising as it is very heavily flavoured with the dead hand of (gasp!) Socialism, the conflict between the classes, the worker's ownership of the means of production and all that. Mind you, the terrain of these two books is so cluttered with all sorts of oddities, a second sphere of worlds seeded by 'ancient Gods', lightspeed travel, dinosaurs, saurs descended from dinosaurs, fun and games with sexuality and relatiosnhips, real live Neandethals. Hang on to your hat and open that volume. Remember 'A female man', 'The dispossessed'? Welcome to the world of immortal cosmonauts and spam in a can. Welcome to the darkness of light."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Dark Light is the second of a trilogy, and this book is where you see more of the point of having the two different threads in the first book.The characters in the first novel have a type of immortality treatment, so a few of them are hanging out on a planet that Matt takes the Bright Star ship to, and their destinies becomed intertwined.Along with the local political manipulation that said long lived guys have been up to in the meantime.Not as interesting as the first novel."
5,A TRUE MASTERPIECE,A true masterpiece for anyone who wants to be a subject matter expert in the area of understanding the new trends as to how al-qaeda has established it's foot in europe. This book also illustrates how al-qaeda will go to great lengths to further its reign of so call crusade against not only America but also Europe. We all must join in the fight against international jihad and terrorism which is now the single most common security threat in the world today.
2,Needs work,"The book is somewhat useful for gaining a better understanding of the terror threat facing Europe but occasionally sweeping generalizations or unclear claims are made. The first sentence of page 71 is ""Today, hundreds of thousands of Muslims residing in Europe embrace, to varying degrees, a militant interpretation of Islam, favoring the introduction of sharia law and despising Western value and principles"". Vidino provides no source for this statistic when one would assume some sort of public opinion poll or academic study to be necessary for such a statement. If a second version of this book were produced with the necessary citations and a decrease in the amount of ""allegedly"" and ""reportedly"" statements it could provide a better resource to those interested in terrorism studies."
4,A pretty good read,"What could have turned into a Christian bashing essay, James Carroll has made into a non-bias, equal account of the Catholic churches behaviour and conduct concerning the Jews throughout history. Although it is primarily geared toward the faults of the Catholic church, Mr. Carroll is quick to point out the mistakes on behalf of Protestants, and the Orthodox church, as well. Along with this, he does not fail to mention the fact that many people see Jewish history as one big painful misery, and if looked at this way, the ability it has to cloud your vision of the past.I would recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in religious history (Christian or not), and for those who are looking for a better understanding of current day events. It may be a little heavy at times, but if given the chance, and read with an open mind, it is a very enlightening read."
5,A Word of Caution on Reviews,"I'm sorry to be unable to write a review at this time but I must say a word about poor Edith Evans.She must have had to read the book three times to review it three times, each time with a polemic against the author rather than any substantive arguments. Three times read and three times unable to come up with anything more than the ""anti-Catholic"" cry of the uninformed. As a practicing Catholic I intend to buy this book, for Ms. Evan's reviews were indeed helpful. Anyone so misinformed or intolerant about her own faith giving three negative reviews just makes me want to buy it and read it!"
1,Endgame,"As professional reviewers have argued, this is not a work of history. Carroll systematically distorts, suppresses, and makes up evidence to prove his preconceived point: that the Catholic Church is an anti-Semitic institution. He makes this point to discredit the church that excommunicated him and which he now despises.Even more bizarre than the laughable ""scholarship"" in his pages is his plea for a new church. This church will not only reject the Catholic church's moral positions. It will reject both the Old and New Testaments as inspired books. It will abandon belief in the divinity of Christ and even in salvation.And this is supposed to be the work of ""a Catholic who so loves his church,"" as the book blurb and many amateur reviewers on this site insist?"
3,Constantine's Sword,It is a very difficult read. I am about 1/3 way through and feel like I have been reading forever. I think it could have been more concise
1,Not history,The work is simply not the work of history it purports to be.The author rarely uses primary sources and leans heavily on secondary sources (many of them with a clear anti-Catholic odor.) The constant switch to autobiographical musings does nothing to advance the argument.
5,Quick Review,"I was not well acquainted with the history of the Catholic church or Christianity and found the book to be completely fascinating reading. A real eye opener, very well written and easy to read. The book is undoubtedly controversial and should most likely be balanced by some other points of view."
1,Illogical,"The book is not convincing.No one disputes that some Catholics have engaged in anti-Semitic activities, just as no one disputes that there are Catholics who have lied, stolen, cheated, procured abortions, and committeed armed robbery. How could it be otherwise in such a huge religion?The question is: did these people commit such crimes because of their church's doctrine or in spite of it? Carroll seems incapable of dealing with the issue. To insinuate that somehow this violence was the product of church teaching, he has to do incredible violence to the evidence. He simply ignores many clear papal condemnations of anti-Semitism: the encyclicals of Pius XI, the radio addresses and well-publicized diplomatic protests of Pius XII against anti-Semitic laws, the many statements by medieval and Renaissance categorically condemning the anti-Semitic violence committed by bogus Christians of the period.This is country-club anti-Catholicism disguised as history."
1,Prejudice on parade,"This book is not a work of history. It is the painful autobiography of an excommnicated ex-priest on why he hates the Catholic Church.As the end of the book makes perfectly clear, the author hates the Church's teaching on revelation, morality, authority, sexuality---just about everything. It is in light of this ardent hate and resentment that the author risibly distorts the record on the Catholic Church on Judaism. Evidence is exaggerated and suppressed to suit the author's bitter pejudices. Evidence is even concocted, such as the absurd story of John XXIII criticizing Pius XII for his alleged ""silence."" In fact, John XXIII had nothing but praise for Pius XII, who personally approved the future John XXIII's rescue work for Jews in Turkey during World War II.A scholarly embarrassment motivated by raw anti-Catholicism."
1,Of pathos and prejudice,"Carroll's book is quite sad. He rummages through Church history, methodically magnifying apparently anti-Semitic statements and then suppressing the many pro-Semitic ones. Once you get to Pius XI, you hear nothing about Mit Brennder Sorge, the pope's detailed denunciation of Nazi anti-Semitism. During WW II, the New York Times carried numerous articles detailing the interventions of Pius XII against anti-Semitic measures in Germany, Rumania, Hungary, Italy, and France. But, of course, Carroll ignores them.For a more objective view of the issue, see the new work by Richard Rychlach."
1,Predictable,"What a tired genre! An ex-priest ""courageously"" takes on his former church and (surprise!) finds the church wanting.The tissue of biased citations, omission of counter-evidence, and tendentious interpretation does not give a serious presentation of the complex history of the relationship between Catholics and Jews.For a serious, scholarly study of the recent chapter in this history, read the fine work of Richard Rychlak and Pierre Blet."
1,disappointing....,"I understand and agree that Carroll has concerns with how some members of the Catholic Church has handled Catholic-Jewish relations in past human history. However, it does seem that Carroll goes beyond that and has an ax to grind with the Catholic Church, an institution that he used to be more intimately involved with. The book uses the tragedies of the Jews over the centuries in order to make quite unrelated and entirely internal Christian point that the author thinks the church should be structured differently than it is-i.e. as a democracy-and that its Christology is too high. Whether one agrees with Carroll's theology, however, the point remains that he has absolutely no right to use Jewish suffering over the centuries to push it forward. There is a self-centered character to this book. I first recommend people to read more about the history of the two institutions (Catholicism and Judiasm), and their respective treatments throughout history, before buying this book."
3,"Repetitive, sometimes painfully tedious, but essential reading","I found this book somewhat difficult to read. It is quite long and wordy, with the author going round and round over several paragraphs to make a point.Nevertheless, I consider the book a very essential read. If you wish to know the extent of bigotry and hatred that religions can produce, please read this book. It is quite likely that you will be shocked by what the author so passionately reveals."
1,Paging Pius XII,"To understand the purpose of the book, you should start with the last chapters. Carroll makes clear what his purpose is: the destruction of the Catholic Church's position on doctrine and ethics. We're beyond the tired debate on birth control and celibacy here. He throws out Christ as redeemer and throws out any idea of divine revelation in Judaism or Christianity.What's left is New Age anti-Catholicism: Cher with footnotes."
1,Misleading,"This is not a serious work of history. The author, a novelist, clearly has a problem with the Catholic Church's teaching on issues of sexuality and authority. He is gripped by an inexplicable hatred of John Paul II, a courageous foe of anti-Semitism. The result is an anti-Catholic fantasy disguised as a history of anti-Semitism.Many reviewers have noted the outrageously unfair use of sources and the obvious suppression of evidence.This serious issue deserves far more than the cavalier, biased rantings of this novelist, who cannot separate history from his own bitter autobiography as an ex-priest.How sad that this work of prejudice could be taken as serious history by anyone."
1,Uncertain genre,"I actually enjoyed reading this book (Carroll's a fine writer), but I gave it a low grade because it's not what it's advertised to be. The entire book is the author's very subjective reflections on his moods, his beliefs, his New Age religious views. This is not a real history of the Church's teachings on the Jews. It is just a novelist musing over everything that comes into his mind.As stream-of-consciousness, it's great fun. But it's not a serious argument..."
5,Read this book,"Constantine's Sword is a wonderful readable, engaging story of Christianity, Judaism, the Church, the Nazis and us. It is told in the first person of James Carroll who agonizes over every new revelation. He takes on the guilt for the church and its antisemitic behavior and this is present as you read each chapter. Historians might object to this technique but this is a very important story and the many reviews which are all very good and also readable tell us that the book is being read by large numbers of people and it causes a reaction. There is no excuse for any religion preaching hate which can lead to persecution of those of another religion. Please read this book even if you borrow it from your neighborhood Library."
3,A History Worth Considering,"As a Jew, I found this book compelling. It is interesting to me that the critiques on this site have sited minutae and/or ""liberalism"" as criticisms. But the factual history of crusades, ghettos, yellow stars and the blood libels are not refuted. This is, I think, a book on which all people should give true reflection. On another front, however, this is not an easy book to read. Between a number of theological and philosophical propositions and Carroll's style of writing, which compelled me to re-read sentences from time to time, the reading was at times slow going. But perseverence won out and I'm glad it did."
3,Forgetting History,"Carroll gives no weight whatsoever to the historical record of anti-Semitism prior to the Christian era, i.e., the Roman persecution of the Jews prior to the Constantine's merger of Church and empire, especially the destruction of the Second Temple and the Diaspora, the enslavement in Egypt under the Pharohs, the Babylonian captivity, etc. To lay all the burden of historical anti-Semitism at the doorstep of Christianity wholly detracts from the author's main premise, even before reaching what are apparently the historical omissions and inaccuracies of this volume. None of these problems with the book, however, excuse the actions of the Church and its leadership in its role in the Augstinian dicta that ""Jews should survive, but not thrive."""
1,Thin on the top,"The entire book rests on sleight-of-hand. The author rightly points out that Christians have and do commit anti-Semitic actions. But Christians also have abortions, steal, maim, and engage in racism. To prove his point the author would have to show that the authorities of the Church encouraged anti-Semitic violence. But he fails to do so. He systematically suppresses the many Church condemnations of anti-Semitism. He even has to admit some of the sources he does quote actually condemned the popular anti-Semitism of the period.This is not a scholarly work. It is certainly not an accurate presentation of the Catholic Church's teaching on Judaism."
1,Sorry excuse,"I'm afraid the book is as bad as serious reviewers have argued for a few months.Although the book claims to be a history, it's not history at all. It is full of misquotations, made-up quotes, and the obvious supression of evidence that the author doesn't like. It is bitterly anti-Catholic and attacks just about everything the Catholic Church teaches. But it is also anti-Jewish in the most primitive way. He demands that Jews give up their belief in being the chosen people, but this would destroy the heart of Judaism. Sorry, I'm not surrendering.The book is also incredibly self-indulgent. He uses the massacre of Jews during the Crusades to tell us about his drinking habits. I'm sorry that he despises his father so much, but what in the world does this have to with anti-Semitism?Save your money and make a contribution to B'nai Brith and Catholic Charities."
4,"Excellent review, sympathetic yet critical","Readers might be interested to know that a very fine and thoughtful review of Carroll's book has been written by Eamon Duffy, Professor of the History of Christianity at the University of Cambridge, and President of Magdalene College. It can be found in the New York Review of Books vol. 58, no. 11, July 5, 2001."
1,The subject isn't what I thought it would be.,"I was looking for history of the christian church not the catholic church, so there was nothing in the book that interested me."
5,One of the best books on the subject -,"In this book, written in brilliantly clear text, Carroll explains in historical detail the origins of Christianity, from the early years and the periods leading to the dominance of the faith in Europe, the unique and tragic relationship of the Church and Jews, culminating in the Holocaust.Carroll is able to write from a position of deep and intimate knowledge having been raised a devout Catholic and experiencing the early post-war years in Germany from a privileged position thanks to his father's very senior position in the US military occupation.This is one of the very best books I have read on history in general and on the very important topic of the Church and Anti-Semitism."
5,This Book is Important,"Carroll has written what I believe to be one of the most important books of our time. In it, he argues that antisemitism is foundational to Christianity.For those who have felt it's brunt, the book is very sad, but it's a relief to see the story in print. One can only hope that it is a call to action.Others may think his argument is specious or corrupt, since he does nothing to personalize antisemitism for the non-Jew, which is the main flaw in the book. He never really answers the question of why antisemitism ought to be a problem for non-Jews, other than that it contradicts what Christ stood for. This is a shame of personal import: Only last year, for example, my nine-year-old son was told by another boy that he ""killed Christ;"" the boy claiming to have learned it in Sunday School. It still occurs.Carroll's point, that antisemitism is real, current, church-sanctioned and relevant, should not be ignored. The problem is that it can be."
1,Bias on parade,"Alexis de Tocqueville once opined that anti-Catholicism is the anti-Semitism of would-be intellectuals. There is no finer item of this genteel anti-Catholicism than the current book and its rapturous recpetion in certain intellectual quarters. Serious historians have condemned the book for its reliance on biased, secondary sources; its deliberate distortion of the few primary sources quoted; its outright fabrication of evidence. The book attacks just about every tenet of the Catholic faith and is full of endless whimpering about the alleged abuses of Carroll's Catholic father.Some of the reviewers simply bask in the same mindless bigotry. What is one to make of the reviewer who uses the review to blame the Catholic Church for the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center!One thing is clear: this absurd book has certainly found the adueince it deserves."
1,Switch and Bait,"Despite its claims, this book is not a history of the relationship between Christians and Jews.The ending chapters reveal the real project: to demand that the Church surrender to the sexual revolution, that it destroy the authority of the papacy, and that it abandon its core doctrine of salvation in Christ.To achieve this goal, the author must paint the popes as moral mosters, as mini-Goebbels. The many statements of Pius XI and Pius XII against anti-Semitism are ignored. Others are so distorted out of context that they are turned into a counter-sense."
1,The cultured despisers,"This is simply a literary exercise in anti-Catholicism by a defrocked and excommunicated priest. The author plows through an ocean of Church documentation on Judaism and systematically highlights those which apear to have anti-Semitic overtones and suppresses the mountain of documents condemning anti-Semitism. The end of the book is a sustained attack on the most basic Catholic beliefs in faith and ethics. This is delightful anti-Catholic fare for the devotees of The Nation, but as purported history it is risible."
1,Illogical,"This odd book tries to argue that the hierarchy of the Catholic Church promoted anti-Semitism, but it proves just the opposite.In its treatment of the patristic period, for example, it notes how the teachings of St. Augustine and St. Gregory the Great condemned violence against Jews. This teaching helped to reduce the popular anti-Semitism inherited from the pagan Roman Empire.In the medieval period, popes and councils repeatedly intervened to defend Jews against popular anti-Semitic ""blood libels"" still alive in rural populations.What the book proves is that the Catholic Church, with the popes in the lead, has systematically fought anti-Semitism and denounced those who attempted to kill and molest Jews. But the author uses his evidence to arrive at just the opposite conclusion.I wonder why."
1,Thumbs down,"Sorry, Jim, but the antidote to anti-Semitism is not anti-Catholicism, especially the smug, tony anti-Catholicism triumphant in this book."
5,a ray of light,"Carrol writes an extraordinary book of incredible depth and substance. Carrol seems to understand that institutions are created by people and people have their own agendas both conscious and subconscious. Carrol has the courage to question what are often perceived as the basic tenets of the church, and does an excellent job showing that these man-made tenets often had an interesting an unique background. Although I teach history I was unaware that the apparitions at Lourdes only happened in the late 19th century. Additionally, many holocaust survivors make clear the efforts of individual catholics to help them, however the institution itself was largely dormant. While the Vatican may not acknowledge this, both the French and German bishops have come to terms with their malfeasance and nonfeasance. I think open-minded Christians and non-Christians will benefit greatly by this book."
1,boring,"Boring, rambling turgid prose. Just when you think he's going to get on with a point, on no, he wanders back to more self-reflection which really is only interesting to him. There may have been two separate books here that in his mind got mixed up as one. To me, it ended up being highly unreadable, and I am a *reader* in the good old-fashioned, chew through James Joyce sense of the word, and I read in 9 languages. The attempted mix of history and self introspection ends up it seems 99% self-absorption. I have the hardback, and at chapter 8, when I realized there were another 4 inches of the book ahead of me, I just couldn't face the thought of all those half paragraph long sentences that repeat thoughts and points made 3 pages earlier. If I lived a million years, life would still be too short to endure all that. Sorry."
2,I thought this was a history book!!,"Mr Carroll used the first 25-30 pages to just talk about his life.I thought that the book was going to get better but it didnt.Mr Carroll keeps talking about his childhood, his teenage years and adulthood while mentioning the history of anti-semitisn once in a while.The book is certainly very dull and boring.It is also very hard to read because everytime Mr Carroll start to talk about history, he almost inmediatly deviates into his own insights and life. The book is certainly too long because Mr Carroll makes it long."
2,The Facts,"I don't know what the religious status of the author has to do with the quality of his argument. But for what it's worth, James Carroll discusses his excommunication in his memoir, An American Requiem. There's no doubt about the facts here.As for the book, it's a wash. Carroll writes well, even if his prose is always too sentimental. But he's not an historian. This is a risible cartoon of Catholicism's teaching on Judaism. For those of us who have read his puerile, anti-Catholic columns in The Boston Globe, it's all sadly predictable."
1,Anti-Semitic,"I was prepared for the anti-Catholicism of this book. But nothing prepared me for its snide anti-Semitism.The author criticizes Jews for believing that God has set them apart as a chosen people. He wants to abandon the entire idea of salvation.Having thrown out the New Testament, he then proceeds to trash the Old."
4,Facing the truth,"This is a courageous book from a catholic confronting with honesty and clarity the pivotal role and responsibility of the church in creating, spreading and maintaining antisemitism. Many interesting historical insights are gained from this massive historical tour of a culture of paranoid hatred: Paul's distortions of Jesus's story, the supersessionism issue, Augustine's ""witness people"" concept, and much more.A particularly interesting information concerns the effective action of the church against Bismarck's Kulturkampf (barely 50 years before Hitler) as compared to her pusillanimous surrender to the third reich."
1,Me! Me! Me!,"The book deals with a serious topic, but the author is so pre-occupied with his own autobiography that he never gets around to serious historical analysis. Most of the book is the author's own cloying reflections on his last drink, on his recent prayer experience, on his latest conversation. The self-indulgence is insufferable.The entire end of the book is nothing but the author's fantasy of a Church reshaped in the image of his anti-Catholic bosses at The Boston Globe."
1,dismal,"In an effort to promote his politically correct beliefs, Carroll twists, avoids, and discards the facts about Constantine and the Early Church neglecting for example, to include the many acts of significant anti Christian violence perpetrated by Jews against the fledgling Christian communities.This is a bland and faulty personally biased trip into the past relying on contemporary sources suporting his own thesis but not delving into the archives. This book should not be taken as anything approaching objectivity and as such deserves neither merit nor attention."
4,FABULOUS JACK COLE,"See it for the brilliant choreography by Jack Cole. Cole was probably the best choreographer working in Hollywood at that time. He did fabulous work with Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. Unfortunately, he's not that well remembered. But his influence can be seen in the work of all the great choreographers who are far more famous than he is! This is an entertaining movie based on TOO MANY HUSBANDS but it shines because of the fantastic dance numbers."
3,Not my favorite Betty Grable movie but worth it for Betty fans,"This is one of Betty Grable's last films and one of the few she made outside of Fox after her long term contract ended. By her own admission, she was a song and dance girl, not a great actress so, as she got older, it was harder and harder for her to find appropriate roles. This role, as a Broadway star, is pretty much stretching the age limit on these things and you can tell that it was getting towards the end of her career as a film star in the capacity of song and dance girl. Marge Champion has more dance time than Betty, something that wouldn't have happened at Fox when Betty was in her heyday. Jack Lemmon is too young for her in his role as one of the husbands; Gower Champion is not at all interesting as the other husband (he dances well but that's about it). I love Betty Grable so it's a good addition to my collection but there are other films of hers that I rather watch."
3,Anyway...it is not so bad,"I expected exactly a record from the T.V. Program, (live, incl. applauses from the public,) but it is a normal cd done in a studio."
5,My all-time favorite Christmas album.,"This has always been my favorite Christmas album, and I was so happy to find it on disc! It originally came out when my mom was a teenager, and I have listened to it every Christmas for as far back as I can remember, up until I graduated and moved out of my mom's home.Now I'm so glad to have it again so I can share it with my children, and hopefully one day they'll share it with theirs. The voices are unbeatable, the medleys are beautifully blended, and the Osmond Originals are unique and outstanding.One day I hope they'll get around to releasing a version with all twenty of the original songs on the album (missing two), but this is still definitely worth having."
5,The Most Harmonious Christmas Ever,"The album has amazing renditions of old Christmas classics as well as some more modern tunes, all of which will get you right in the mood for the Holidays. I think that each of their voices are placed perfectly within the wonderful arrangements to create and do benefit to their harmonies and amazing ranges. This is one of the true classics for anyone who remembers the joy of Christmas, especially when the boys would come out and sing on the Andy Williams Christmas Special. The accapella carolling is my favorite of all, I believe, though all the songs had me singing along, just as I had years ago."
2,one of its kind but could be better!,Having been put on a low sodium diet recently I have been searching high and low for alternative recipes for indian cooking. Mrs Lakhani's book does a decent job of explaining how and why dietary changes must be made. I did find the lack of pictures a little discouraging and a few of the recipes I did try out have not turned out as well as I would like. But then what is food without a little fat and a little salt?? Bleah!!The book also provides chapters on the scientific side of dietary changes but i'm afraid I found that a little dull :( If you are looking for low fat / low sodium cookbooks (indian) i highly recommend Secrets of fat free cooking by Priya Kulkarni and Anita Ranade. Every recipe I've tried from that book has been wonderful and they have a sizeable segment on non vegetarian cooking!
3,"Beware, Item is NOT as pictured","The item I received is much different from what is pictured here. It still functions as it is supposed to, but I would prefer to get what I paid for. What you will get if you order on this page is actually this: [...]The product pictured is can be found here:Pachmayr Decelerator Slip On Recoil Pad"
3,They sent me the wrong one!,"I expected to actually get what I saw in the product's picture. What I picked up out of the box was a completely different stock pad. Luckily, It still fits well enough and the wrinkles on the sides are symmetrical to each other so ill probably get used to seeing the one I have. What I ended up with still works but id like to actually get what I pay money for rather than some random mystery gift."
1,Doesn't stay put!,"I got one of these recoil pads for my Ruger Mini-30 (7.62x39 in case you didn't know). It went on just fine and seemed like a good fit. HOWEVER, the sides or ""cup"" that hold it to the butt of the stock is so soft and rubbery that it shifted around (usually off to the side) with every shot. I'm sure it would stay on just fine if I was willing to permanently glue it to my stock, but I don't want to do that (and I shouldn't have to!). Sorry I bought it."
5,Quality product from a quality company,The fit is very secure on my .22 rifle. I installed this on this rifle more to protect the butt stock and keep the rifle from sliding when placed on a tiled floor or when out in the field and it needs to be rested up against a fence post. Price was reasonable and it's made using quality materials. I have many of these pads on other rifles and I can honestly recommend this product.
5,Just right,"Hello, I need a little extra length to my rifle stocks to make them comfortable, these work well with no modifications to the rifle."
4,A great word picture,"I recommend this book because of the ideas presented and how they communicate.The idea of training versus trying really resonated with me and I believe others. What Ortberg writes here is alone worth the purchase of the book. If using this in a small group helps others move from trying to training, it's money well spent."
4,Excellent lighweight compass,"I like mirror compasses not only because they make it easy to plot a line, but because the mirror can be used for several other things such as shaving and attracting attention (a rough-and-ready heliograph). This is a nice, solid little compass that lacks only the ability to mark the magnetic off-set. It weighs almost nothing and that's a good thing for hiking! As it's plastic it won't last thirty years like the old-fashioned metal ones, but then again it is cheap and easy to replace and the lightness makes it indispensible for navigation, especially through heavily wooded territory where cheaper GPS units have problems."
4,Great for Tiny Tots,"We bought this toy for our almost one year old & I believe he is the perfect age bracket for this toy. Its a solid toy, very well constructed & performs exactly as described. A good buy."
5,My baby grandaughter's favorite Xmas toy !,"My 9 mos. old grandaughter just had her 1st Christmas ! She rec'd more-than-enough toys from family & friends BUT she loves the Tolo toys the best. This one seems sturdily-made and is 'fun' even for the grown-ups ------ that is, if you can get the baby to 'share' !"
5,Brilliant,"I just finished reading it for the fifth time, and it just gets deeper and more profound and more exciting and better.It is the very best space adventure ever, so why did the IDIOT publishers make it impossible for people I recommend it to to find? Who could be so stupid?"
4,This is a blend of clay and crystals,"A blend of crystals and clumping clay is good. However, I have found that the lowest maintenance litter is that of pure crystals. You just have to stir it. The feces dry out and can be removed with a food service gloved hand. However if your cat doesn't want crystals, then one of the blends is good."
4,fun game overall,"Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game, but it does have some major downsides. The graphics are nothing special and the voice-acting is horrendous. But the challenge is great!! If you want to improve your typing or if you like a typing challenge then this is a must have. There are lots of options that let you specialize what to work on. You can practice anything from certain keys to huge sentences!!"
4,This Will Bring Up Your Typing Game,"Love this game, wish they made more of these types.This game will raise your WPM rate, and the end levels are extremely challenging even for seasoned typists.Play through this and you will demolish any typing test."
1,the typing of the dead,This game is a great way to become proficient at typing. Every tutorial you will need from start to finish is here and it is fun. Want to excel on the keyboard? This is a game sans mindless violence. It's there for a reason =).
5,How mature?,This game is rated Mature because of the violence. I'm usually very conservative about violence....for some reason this game's violence is less alarming to me than most.I'm an excellant typist and the arcade and original modes of the game are very challenging for me.The game has basic typing tutor modes that can lead someone from the beginning keyboarding. Yet it also has levels that are challenging enough for the typing pros.It's a welcome addition to my computer game collection. Has good replay value.
3,CHERRY ON TOP,"WILD CHERRY-PLAY THE FUNK: This awkwardly titled compilation obviously shoulda been called PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC, after WILD CHERRY's soulful slab of a monster hit that even rock fans could groove to. About half of their first (and best) album is here, grandly grinding against lesser known followups, notably the inevitable PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC cash-in BABY DON'T YOU KNOW (sample line: ""Baby don't you know that the honky's got soul""). Horny horns, THE CHERRY SISTERS' hot call-and-response backup, ROB PARISSI's macho growl, and squealin' guitar licks defined this band's patented brand of so called ""electrified funk""...to lump it in with disco would be an insult to their meatier drive and more venomous vibe. Even gutbucket covers of THE FOUR TOPS and WILSON PICKETT hit the mark here. The party peters out by the last two tracks, but you can always go back and spin their indispensable ""greatest hit""!RATING: THREE CHERRY STEMS"
1,junk,dont waste your money or time on this-these collars come apart at the most inopertune time- scary if you have a beast for a dog-get the metal one piece collar sized right for your dog.
3,"Little of this, little of that","I'm not entirely impressed with this product but believe I still would have bought it (I still use it almost daily).The concept and idea are great, and so far the product has remained in good condition. I have a large dog that can definitely place a lot of wear and tear on items.The snap in/release function can be difficult and confusing and I would question the effectiveness of the faux prongs on dogs with long and/or thick fur.I've had some people ask if it's a Lego-brand collar. My dog, in general, is well trained and well behaved; but I would draw serious concerns for those looking to replace a true prong-collar with this if they feel that the pulling and lunging issues with their animal are still on issue.I would highly recommend this as a replacement to a choke-chain for those that have general control over their pet."
3,Would have preferred not to need these ...,"These are additional links for the ""large"" pinch collar which should have been sufficient for our 60-pound setter mix, but wasn't.Added two of these to make the original easier to slip on and off.[Some have complained of difficulty snapping these on and off -- you have to squeeze any two link together, points down, and then push one of them up; it will snap out. Snaps in the same way.]"
5,Great product,This collar is very effective in helping to maintain control over our 106 pound rottweiler when he gets focused on something we need him to ignore. It is strong and has held when he strained with all his might.
5,great collar,This collar is wonderful and has completely changed my dogs behavior. IN the past we have used a metal pinch collar but I like this collar better because it is not as intimidating and less alarming to observers. The product was shipped promptly.
4,StarMark Addalink,I feel the links worked well with the collar. I like that I can adjust it based on my dog's growth rate.
3,"Power steering, - - increased with smaller link collar","This is a great training collar option if you are uncomfortable with a using traditional pinch/prong collar.However the small link StarMark collar will provide more control than the larger link model.I recommend buying TWO of the smaller link StarMark collars, so that you can add additional links for the perfect fit on your larger necked dogs.Remember that it is a training tool, to maximize effectiveness follow the recommended guidelines as with any training equipment."
2,Really hard to put on.....,"This is a classic case of great idea, bad design. Really hard to put on your dog. They should have used the same clasp they used on the large collar and it would have been a 5 star product."
5,Stops dog from pulling,Stopped my dog from pulling. Great purchase! Easy to add on and take off as needed. Definitely a great investment for dog owners.
1,Faulty Advertising,"I ordered the ""add a links"" when I purchased two small collars, based on the advertising that they worked with the small collars. The packaging even states that they work with small collars. Not so! They are bigger and will not snap onto the small collars. Money wasted!"
3,Baby Steps,"This is the sound of Gilmour taking his first tentative steps from Pink Floyd and finding a few interesting things on the way. There is only traces of where he would eventually take the legendary band's sound and songwriting, but it's here for the careful listener. And of course, some delicious guitar work."
3,A good cd but...,"It does not deserve a five stars, I would give it to ""Wish you were here"" for instance. It is not a four stars also, this kind of rating would go to album like ""A momentary lapse of reason"" The conclusion, each of these are greater albums than David's first solo effort. One thing is clear, remember that this album has been issued between ""Animals"" and ""The Wall""It is clear to me that David, with this album, is showing that he is not the genious for the Floyd's, this title defineately goes to Roger.Overall, a good cd, not a masterpiece (five stars) and not close to it (a four star, so this one deserve a three stars, but it is a good album after all."
3,Dissapointed,"A solo album from David Gilmour should be the perfect add on to anyone's album collection right? Well, judging by many of the songs on this self titled album the answer to that question may be a resounding hell no!. Dissapointing i know, especially considering Gilmour's incredible contributions to Pink Floyd: it was his visceral guitar tone and blistering riffs, not to mention his highly orgasmic solos that brought commercial interest to the bands eclectic sound. Unfortunately on David Gilmour most of the songs suffer from an utter lack of melody, ""Theres no way out of Here"" has a plethora of riffs but no personality, the same goes from ""Cry from the Street"", ""So far away"", and ""No Way"". Stick to the instrumentals, ""Mihalis"" brims with laser beams of pure tone and ""Raise my Rent"" is brooding and wonderful, another classic David Gilmour solo that that brims with urgency, intensity and an incredibly clear sense of the real building blocks of crafting a musical release."
3,not David's best album,"To me this one sounds somewhat strain-free and insincere.I expected more intense feelings from Gilmour, so I liked ""About Face"" much more.Recording quality could be better too (OK, I am picky)"
5,Too Bad there isn't six or seven or even 10 stars,"This is simply a wonderful journey into the talent of David Gilmour. I have to agree that David Gilmour is, and has always been, an artist who can draw you into his music because he paints such beautiful musical landscapes . . ."
5,Tasty Gilmour Guitar,"I was happy to re-discover this awesome disc of Gilmour's early solo work.It's packed full of tasty guitar solo's and David's classic vocals.I believe this disc has been overlooked by most Pink Floyd fans.I can't help but wonder why it is rarely played on classic-rock radio.Even Gilmour himself has abandoned most of these wonderful songs.I would love to hear the instrumental ""Raise my Rent"" on his next tour.This is a strong five-star disc for any Gilmour Fan!"
4,Pretty good job Dave,"I would like to recommend this disc to anyone who really enjoys David Gilmour's smooth voice. You will get plenty of it here although two of the tracks are instrumentals. He lacks the grit that Roger brought to the table but it is an enjoyable disc anyway. I believe that Mihalis, There's No Way Out Of Here and Short and Sweet are the best tracks but they are all pretty decent. No surprises here and no explosive vocals either. Just sweet music and smooth guitar work from Dave. I would rank it really high as far as Floyd solo works go and put it maybe third right behind Roger's Amused To Death and Radio Kaos. David's second solo disc doesn't really compare with this one in the least. It was titled About Face and sounds all too much like Momentary Lapse Of Reason. Very 80's sounding pop music with nothing special about it in the least other than his excellent voice. Enjoy the disc if you are purchasing it at this time and God Bless YOU."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I agree with ""Moses"" on one point, that this sounds like Pink Floyd rehashed. But I think David Gilmour is a very excellent guitarist. He just doesn't sound much different here. A kind of a waste of money. ""Animals""etc are a lot better if you want to hear his good guitar playing."
4,4 1/2 stars,"2006's ""on an island"" was a immediate classic in my world, so i had to go back and reinvestigate mr gilmour's back catalouge of solo work, which is only two other albums, sadly. this, his first solo outting, from 1978, is a fine album that i had overlooked all these years. closer in tone to ""dark side of the moon,"" than to ""the wall,"" which his 1984 release ""about face,"" more resembles, this recording is a strong effort, with mr gilmour's relaxed voice and lyrical guitar work shining on nine excellent songs. for me, the real standout on this record is the gorgeous instrumental ""raise my rent,"" which contains heartfelt guitar wizardry that is as fine as any playing to be found by mr gilmour anywhere. all in all, an outstanding rock album. i'm glad i finally got around to it."
3,"""Debut""","Though technically this is not Gilmour's debut, but it is his solo debut and I have to say that it's a bit weak. There are 3 stand-out tracks however, that are worth the cheap price ($...); Mihalis, There's No Way Out of Here, and Raise My Rent - excellent fretwork on the latter. Actually, Gilmour's guitarwork is always tasteful and minimalist, as well as his vocals. I wouldn't compare this to Pink Floyd though, only because it doesn't really sound like Pink Floyd (maybe Pink Floyd-lite) - I can see how some people would think that though. I usually like solo albums from ""highlight band members"", but this one was a bit of a disappointment."
2,No Way,The song No Way is extremely well done. Other than that it's off to the used CD store with this one.
1,David a talent???,"I'm unsure how many years people are willing to pay David Gilmour for replicating Roger Waters stuff.Gilmour is self-admittedly not a good guitarist,so why waste your money on Floyd replicas???I'm sorry, he did some good ""mood"" solos with Floyd, I'm just tired of hearing them over and over in a ""New"" song which sounds just like a Roger Waters song with bad poetry (lyrics)."
4,Getting to know David,"It took a while to warm up to me,but when it did,I was hooked.Songs start kind of corny and repitisious but grow into something beutiful and flowing.The song ""So far away"" is the loneliest song I know.Gilmour's haunting guitar work is intoxicating.Slip this cd in while you're in your car, and let it flow in with the pavement."
2,Not One Good Song,This is a huge disappointment. Every song goes absolutley nowhere. David sounds like he is just learning how to write songs (where is the melody??) and what is here is very empty and meandering. Some of the guitar playing is good but overall there is not one good song or melody here. Skip this and get his 2nd solo album About Face which is excellent!
3,It's a David Gilmour album called David Gilmour,"There was a good system of checks and balances in place within Pink Floyd between the musical stylings of David Gilmour and the biting lyrics of Roger Waters. Left to their own devices they each did OK on their first couple of solo albums; in this case a solid set of tunes featuring some exemplary guitar work. Overall, the songs aren't that memorable and the production sounds dated in a middle-of-the-raod 70s sort of way. An enjoyable record, but not likely to stay in heavy rotation."
4,A fun and funny read,"I had to write a comment after reading some of the dreadfully earnest reviews above - I found Kipnis' book to be funny, clever and insightful. Its not a self-help book or a marriage counselling book. You should be able to enjoy the somewhat tongue-in-cheek diatribe against the absurdity of what relationships so often turn into, without becoming quite as defensive as some of the ealier comments."
2,A counter-argument,"From 'The Screwtape letters' by C.S. Lewis:...humans who have not the gift of continence can be dettered from seeking marriage as a solution because they do not find themselves 'in love', and, thanks to us, the idea of marrying with any other motive seems to them low and cynical. Yes, they think that. They regard the intention of loyalty to a partnership for mutual help, for the preservation of chastity, and for the transmission of life as something lower than a storm of emotion."
3,Blame 'Sex and the City',"Love is blind, and marriage is an institution....Take this book for what it is: a witty summation of the 'supposed' state of relationships today. It's entertaining. But as was stated below by a much better reviewer than I, marriage and the 'stability' it can offer to people, and especially children, is indeed essential to a society that wants to function correctly. Take one look around and see that this is hardly the case anymore (if it ever was.) While fun to watch, 'Sex and the City' is symptomatic of the relationship world we live in today. I'm not hard hearted, and I won't totally blame people (ie: women) for the choices they make...it's the world we were born into, and grew-up in. (Albeit SATC is an extreme example.) In the end, for most, admit it, being forever single can be emotionally empty. I wish this weren't the case, but (sigh), it is."
1,What a Crock!,"Don't have what it takes to be faithful? Looking for justification for your own lack of dignity, self-respect, and for your utter disregard for the feelings of your fellow human beings? Want to blame it all on capitalism? Well, here's your book.Again,what a crock."
5,Polemic is the correct description!,"Laura Kipnis's effort is one of those books that makes you nod in agreement and cringe for having agreed with the author's views in the first place. Against Love's controversial topics on romantic and sexual relationships overwhelmed me in various occasions. Kipnis's wit is priceless - her cynicism palpable. She's voiced all jarring views on sex, love and relationships with black humor and insight. I happen to agree with most of her views. I recommend this daring and polemic book to all relationship cynics."
4,mneumonics:a novel approach,"Although I'm aware of the criticisms of this approach (that you should learn a language through material already acquired in that language) how do you start out if you don't have little or no stuff to start with?I haven;t referred to the Spanish Memory Book for a few months, yet I clearly remember most of the jingles, the words, and the meanings as well. In addition, I find myself making up my own jingles for Spanish and for other languages."
4,I'm super! Thanks for asking!,"""South Park"" is not for the faint of heart or for kids... but great hilarious entertainment for adults. There is at least one overly offensive scene in each episode, but it is always redeemed by side-splitting laughter in another scene.My only complaint (althought it is a BIG complaint) is that the introductions to each episode by Matt and Trey can not be easily skipped. Having to hold down the fast-forward button on the remote for 5 minutes to get past these little skits is a royal pain and the antithesis of why people get DVD versions in the first place. You should be able to skip to the next selection right to the episode instead of suffering through these skits more than once."
2,this vol is ok but the sound sux,"yo well im a big southpark fan but i gotta say for dvds of southpark they suck , just get the vhs tapes of sothpark cuz i boght vol vol N vol on dvd.. in the picture N sound both sux..."
4,Sweet!,"This DVD had me ROTFL. ""Hey, you're the one who sawed him in half!"" I wish it had been possible to access the episodes directly without having to go through the cheesy commentary. Perhaps the next group of DVDs could be organized better?"
5,sweeet!,the additional intro by the creators makes it far preferable to buy the videos or dvds and not just taping them off comedy central.
1,Buy something else,"If you like Clarke, do not buy this book or you will be disappointed. If you have not read Clarke before, do not buy the book or you will think that all his novels are like this. There is very little of sci-fi; most of the book delves in the past life of the characters, trying to demonstrate that all of them have some sort of childhood trauma. The Sci-fi part lacks punch, and there is nothing ""scary"" about the world menace. Do not waste your money; buy something else (Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth for example)."
2,ACC readers should join together and take down Lee!!,"I thought the book would have been wonderful except for the sex scenes! They didn't do anything for the book! Like Troy's stupid computer game, Gretta swimsuit, and that young man's problems with controlling his urges. How did that add to the plot?The whole plott seemed juvenile. Like a child's book.I don't think Clarke and Lee are compatable. They don't produce good quality books!DON'T BUY A BOOK WITH GENTRY LEE'S NAME ON IT!!"
2,Not A Memorable Book,"It may have Arthur C. Clarke's name on the cover, but the actual content written by Clarke is minimal. Go marketing! Barely anything about the book stuck after reading it, and normally when I read a Clarke novel I retain vivid descriptions of character and dilemmas. Not much science fiction (very unlike Clarke, which I why I think he 'wrote' it 'name only' by providing the only first chapter and maybe a few paragraphs later), and most of the novel is a tedious bollywood trainwreck.I can't say enough stuck with me to even 'hate' the novel, as that would be a strong inspired emotion. Strong inspired emotions are not present in this mediocre book, which read like a hollywood script rejected a few hundred times for being too cliche. Aliens steal gold, outwit military forces, gratuitous sex scene, humans meander, more gratuitous sex scenes, trainwreck of plots, the end (lacks resolution).Save yourself the trouble and find a better use for your reading time."
2,Not Clark,"I think that Clark wanted to show us that he can write about not-tech stuff too. Not bad, when trying, but the plot is a little unconnected. I didn't like it. My advice, try another book, it is not worse than 3001, but almost."
1,A bitter disappointment,"The book is simply too long (almost double than tha needed pages). Tha tale articulates in 3 different paths who merely cross at the end, not developing enough the single characters. What about the religious craziness of the Commander ? Lieutenenat Todd who is he ? The speech of Nick Williams to Alien MACHINES convincing them not to fulfill tehir duty is ridiculous"
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing.,"This is one of the stupidest books I have ever read, and I have read hundreds of science fiction novels. I kept thinking it would get better as I read farther into it, but it never did, and the ending was the worst part."
1,A total bore,"I have read many SF books and this ranks as one of the worst. The plot is ridiculous with aliens hiding under the ocean and needing lead and gold to fix their spacecraft and just happening to contact three humans who manage to steal the gold from more stupid thieves. They also ""out fox"" the US Navy to save the day at the end from the aliens that let them walk around their ship, but never really act if the humans are there. It would make a great story for a movie remake of Plan 9 From Outerspace. Stupid, stupid, stupid."
2,All character development and no story,"Eighty-five percent of this story is character development, and the characters are as paper thin as the science fiction plot. Skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"It has been a number of years since I read any science fiction, so I decided to play it safe and pick up something by an author with a long and outstanding track record. I chose a real lemon. While the alien sequences are compelling and believable, much of the book is wasted on petty and BORING development of the human characters. I really can't recomnend it. I should have checked the reviews on Amazon before I dropped the bucks for this book."
2,it's too much tv-like adventure and nearly no SF,The difference between Clarke and Lee evidently: Clarke wrote the sf-components and Lee wrote the soap opera part. And this mixage is terrible! There are a few nice parts at the beginning and under the sea but no more... Clarke shouldn't write with Lee...forget it
1,Dissapointing,"I have always been a huge Arthur C Clarke fan, I felt that his contribution to Cradle was only limited to the first chapter of this book; which was good. Other than that the book was stretched and a dissapointment."
2,"It was grotesque, out of Clarke's style","I was disappointed to read a book by Arthur C. Clarke inwhich his finess of style was lost due to the co-authorshipof a scientist who has no such a trait.I was sorry to read their first venture together in TheGardens of Rama, and my reading of this ""last"" novelconfirmed my first impression. I am sorry to say that I willnot buy another book which includes Gentry Lee as an author."
1,Weak,This homie can't even compare to Lil Rob. Lil Menace is a straight up weak homiess don't waste the money he can even come up with his own beats leva. At least Lil Rob comes up with some of his own. Lil Menace sit down right some better songs and try to come up with a beat and hit then make a record
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"Having been a nutrition counselor at a cancer center for over 3 years I must say that these recipes, despite being beautiful, simple, healthy and delicious, are not appropriate for many patients under treatment for cancer who many be experiencing nausea,vomiting, diahrrea, or who may have supressed immune systems. I think the promotion of this as a book for very ill people is misguided. It's just a short little book with tasty healthy recipes written by a chef and full of ""observations"""
5,very good musical,"""Call Me Madame,"" is a beautiful and colorful musical. Ethel Merman is great and sings out some lovely songs.. Also Vera-Ellen is lovely in it and does a great dance number with Donald O'Connor,"" it's really good and well worth seeing. George Sanders is great in it and he and Ethel Merman make a nice couple. It's a musical that is really a fast for the eyes. So many beautiful costumes and scenery. The made it look a lot like the German towns and villages were the story takes place mostly. With all the great costumes, music and actors, you can't go wrong. It's a real beautiful musical and a great escape musical too."
4,Thrilled,I was thrilled to add it to my DVD collections. I have not been able to see it for 40 years
4,the hostess with the mostess,"Mrs. Sally Adams (ethel merman) is going to lichtenburg to be the new ambassador for the united states. She falls in love with the minister of foreign affairs (george sanders) and her press atache ken (donald Oconnor) meets a lady (vera ellen) in the shop and falls for her. Problems ensue as she turns out to be the princess and is engaged to be married. The marriage will proceed as soon as an american loan is approved...This movie is great old fashioned fun. Ethel merman belts out her tunes and hearing george sanders sing. I never knew he had such a warm and pleasant singing voice. Some unforgettable songs are the ""hostess with the mostest"" and ""you're just in love"". The dance numbers are provided by vera ellen and donald oconnor so expect good dancing. I especially love donalds solo as he dances through a bar half drunk to what chance have i with love. the precision and timing is amazing!Overall great!"
4,A good movie of the Broadway musical,"Call Me Madam was a good musical, although (by the standards of the mid-twentieth century) not an outstanding one. This DVD presents it very well. Since many of the jokes may not be understood unless the viewer has some knowledge post World War II period in which it is set, some viewers may not appreciate them. However, the Irving Berlin music & lyrics are enjoyable even if you don't understand the jokes. Video & audio quality is very good."
3,Call me Ethel,"Ethel Merman got to make the film version of her Broadway hit, Call Me Madam. Previously, producers almost always cast other actresses to recreate her stage successes. Stage fans complained (as they did later when Audrey Hepburn substituted for Julie Andrews in My Fair Lady), but seeing Merman in Call Me Madam should silence the complainers. She sinks her own film version. Her presence is no more than a gross caricature: vulgar, utterly charmless and crude. Either she refused to accept any direction or the director found it impossible to guide her into giving a performance for film.On the other hand, seeing Donald O'Connor in this film makes one wish that he had found more musical roles in film and on stage. Vera Ellen dances at the top of her game with her singing dubbed as usual for the terrific Irving Berlin score."
4,Bringing it all back home,"Infinite Xs was a supergroup, combining members of Team Dresch, Longstocking, The Automaticans, & Fighter D. Hell, it was the band that brought the wonderful Jody Bleyle out of hiding. They toured a little, produced one good album, then split up. This record is worth owning if you've followed the scene it was burped out of, though it isn't exactly a masterpiece. It is, however, pretty damn good and any shortcomings (by which I mean a few less-than-steller tunes) can be forgiven for it's magnificant ending (by which I mean the last few tracks, which rock the house). Play it loud."
2,Simplistic Approach to Complex Issues,"I read this book in conjunction with my grad school studies, having already spent more than 10 years in the relief and development sector. I found the author's approach to be sophomoric at times and hardly practical at others. While the overall message of Do No Harm is good, it was not a very insightful or compelling read because it is based on interviews with anonymous individuals and does not have any first hand experience. Maybe if the author had actaully worked in the field for 5-10 years she would have had more insight into some of the seriouss challenges."
3,What is going on here?!,"I remember watching this novela with my family when I was a child. My mother recently bought the dvd for my grandmother, and the whole family was excited to sit down and watch it, especially me because of the English subtitles. I quickly became incredibly confused because the editing was so oddly choppy. I understand that the cinemetography would be on the more amateur side, since this is an older novela and a soap opera after all, but this seemed like something more.I looked up video clips of the show on youtube, and to my dismay, the clips of the same scenes on my dvd had several minutes more to them than on my dvd. Who ever edited this disc hacked away at all the important parts that link this into a coherent story. Please, someone come out with the real show!!! This is ridiculous!So, yes to Maria la del Barrio, NO NO NO TO THIS EDITION! AGHHHH!"
2,"GREAT SOAP OPERA, BUT TERRIBLE EDITION","This DVD pack has a good video quality, and it has the main theme (""María la del Barrio"", by Thalía), but I don't know who made this horrible edition. They just cut important scenes from de story. If you didn't see the soap opera on television, it will be difficult for you to understand, because everything happens so fast.And that's not the worst thing. They tried to replace the original score. I can't explain why!. It's so difficult to believe that Televisa can't pay for the rights of the music. You can't understand many of the dialogues because of that. It's like a noise.If you like this soap opera, just don't buy this item. I'm a fan of Thalía, and now I know why she never says anything about this DVD's. They are not a good product. I give two stars to it because of the song, the video quality, and the DVD cover."
2,Scratched DVDs,"I received my order on time and was very excited to watch this show. However when I opened the box I saw that all of the DVDs were scratched due to the interesting box they're placed in which allows for the plastic surfaces around the DVDs to hit and scratch the DVDs very easily. It was impossible to miss and I cannot believe anyone would pack DVDs in this manner. Nonetheless I managed to make the DVDs work and watch them, until I reached the 3rd DVD whose first side is basically ruined entirely and my computer refused to read it. Hence I couldn't watch the rest of the show. I was not planning on writing this review had the DVDs actually managed to work in the end, but now that there is no way for me to actually watch the rest of the show I think it is quite appropriate that I write this review. I am extremely disappointed and am going to take action to get UNSCRATCHED DVDs shipped to me for free, because this is absolutely ridiculous."
1,DON'T BUY IT - IT'S NOT A COMPLETE EDITION,Do not buy this DVD unless you are okay with the fact that the sound quality was poor and that the DVD does not contain the whole series. They chopped it down to a point where it is barely understandable.
3,Novela muy buena pero muy editada,"esta novela esta muy bien pero la edicion en DVD está tan editada que hay escenas que van saltando de capitulos en capitulos y te lo resumen en 5 minutos y quitan gracia a la historia. pero bueno, es una forma de recordar una de las mejores novelas de los 90. la musica de aperura es la original pero luego como Televisa no ha querido pagar los derechos pues han metido musica distinta que se va mezclando con la original y queda fatal la verdad. Televisa ganaria más dinero si hiciera las cosas bien. deberia volver a editar grandes novelas como Cuna de Lobos, Rosa Salvaje, Los ricos tambien lloran en versiones originales completas. seguro que la gente las compra y tan encantadas. en fin, a ver si Televisa se digna a hacer las cosas bien."
2,Horrible music,"I saw very little of the original telenovela, so I was interested to see this DVD. Unlike some other viewers, I didn't have trouble following the plot. The show is dated but still entertaining despite some bad acting. HOWEVER, the music score is AWFUL. It's harsh, jumbled noise that makes no sense, is highly distracting and drowns out the dialogue. So bad that I had to watch a lot of scenes with the sound off. It would be better to have NO music than such horrible music. It detracts from the show a lot. Many telenovelas (when originally shown on TV) have very good music that help the plot along. This one is all but killed by its horrible music. Unless you have reason to be curious about this particular show, I recommend you buy another one due to the bad bad music."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, the whole series and a good price. There are english subtitles but it would be better if there was english voices too."
4,Great Show..but is it all there?,This was a great show and I can now understand what is going on because of the subtitles. However...there are scenes (or episodes) missing from the original series. The catfight in the opera parking garage is only seen briefly in a flashback. And where is the scene of Maria's first dinner with the family?It's a riveting show!
2,Maria la del barrio,"Tough to watch Thalia, she is a good singer but not liking her acting abilities (or lack of). Yes, I agree it's a classic but a bit raw for my tastes. The only saving grace was to see fernando colunga (the young, inexperienced version)."
3,MORE FOR THE OLDER INVESTOR,"I agreed with alot of what he had to say,but I think his approach is too conservative for the younger investor.He is very strongly into bond funds and feels that everybody should have at least 6 or 7 different bond funds.Are you kidding me? Why should a 30 year old have bonds at all? I prefer to be a little bit more aggressive at least until I'm 50, then maybe bonds would make more sense.Just my opinion."
3,Poorly machined part,"Looks ok, but poor quality machining. Tapped holes threads stripped even before use. Had to use my own self threading hardware. Made it work."
5,Excellent Quality,Great quality timepiece by Lorus. I bought it for my wife for xmas and she has been very happy with it.
3,Not the best in a strong series.,"The St. Petersberg Quartet has recorded all the Shostakovich string quartets for this label. The sound quality is generally very good and the playing is usually at a very high level. Some of their interpretations, e.g., those of the 14th and 15th quartets, have struck me as revelatory. I had high expectations for this CD, but was disappointed. The 6th quartet is well done. Their performance of the 4th is marked by some untidy ensemble playing and sheds no new light on this enigmatic work. The 8th is the strongest quartet on this CD, but I prefer the Borodin performance on their 2-CD Virgin set."
4,great effort,After i heard the cd songs for a dying planet i was blown away by 2 songs decade and my friend had tears in my eyes while my friend was playing.brought back memories of friends that i have lost.felt bad but felt good at the same time and decade said a lot of the things that are wrong in the world in 10 years all and all it was a great cd to get into.my favorite joe walsh is barnstorm and when he was with james gang yer album was tops
3,"First half good, second half bad.","The first six songs of this set start out good. They're in the typical Walsh vein-- humorous lyrics, good slide playing-- but the second half, for me, falls apart. Especially the Carol King cover."
4,Beginn,"Noch nicht so ausgereift wie die folgenden Platten, hat aber gute Momente. ""Gypsy"" gefällt mir nicht. Anspieltips ""walking in your shadow"", ""Melinda"" ""Dreammare"", die Bonus Tracks sind interessant. Seinen kreativen wie kommerziellen Frühling sollte die Gruppe bald mit ""Salisbury"" haben. Außerdem anschaffenswert: ""Look at yourself"", ""Demons and Wizards"" und ""Magicians Birthday"". Mit diesem cover schuf sich Uriah Heep ein dämonisches Image. Auf dem Cover ist übrigens David Byron abgebildet, der danach die Spinnweben lange nicht aus seinen Haaren entfernen konnte. Darauf wäre ich vor 28 Jahren nicht gekommen Thomas Richter"
5,Magnificent Passage,Great story. very quick read. Enjoyable. I am really glad I looked into Kat Martin. I have been enjoying her books immensley.
4,Wonderful and Engaging,"This book kept me up all night. The story was engaging and exciting. I would have given this book 5 stars, but the heroine was always resisting and then giving in to the hero during the love scenes. But, if you are looking for a hot, exciting, and spellbinding read then definetly read this book."
3,Magnificent Passage,While magnificent Passage is well written. I just is not my type of book. Aliens living as humans is unreal.
3,There's no way out of here,"Only a couple of good songs on this CD.The only way to get the song ""theres no way out of here""which is one of Davids best works"
3,Good...but not great.,"Though, a relatively good chunk of what comes up in 'the scriptures,' or what have you, it still isn't as much as some might want. It doesn't go that in depth into anything, but still points you in the direction to where you might be able to look."
4,A Small Unit that Works Well,"This 1/4"" drill/driver does not use a battery but plugs in. I find that I do not use a portable drill enough to get any value from expensive batteries that always die within a few years. This unit is compact and easy to use. It has plenty of power and the impact driver function really helps get or keep things moving. Despite the power, I found I could easily control the speed to drill in wood screws. I suggest buying the 1/4"" chuck to be able to use standard bits. I expect to hand this tool down to my Son after many years of use."
4,Great Impact Driver,"I use these professionally in building construction, drives Tek screws in steel all day, drives lag screws in timber better. Will eventually overheat.I bought two here because according to the local store it's being discontinued?! I hope there is a comparable corded replacement coming, the extra costs for cordless aren't worth the money."
5,No More batteries,"Tired of buying batteries, came across this searching online for a corded impact driver. Decided to purchase and yes I am glad I did. Powerful, to much so for fragile products , but great for driving 3"" screws all day.I actually drove a 3"" deck screw all the way through a two by two with my first use of this tool. Had to learn to back off LOLGood size, well balanced, not to heavy.I would recommend this to anyone that is tired of buying batteries all the time and wants a good and powerful impact driver that you can work with all day."
4,Totaly different,"This book gathered dust on my TBR (to be read) shelf for over 3 years. I discovered it the other day...Great book Rachel Davis as managed to introduce characters that I have never met before. After many years of romance reading this was a very welcome surprise! These are not cookie cutter characters who seem oooh so familiar, they are brand new and fresh. The plot revolves around the ""James Gang"" and yes most of us have a cursory knowlege of the Gang and their exploits...but Rachel Davis has a real affinity for presenting this time and this place with real depth. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Where is Rachel Davis now? I want more!"
3,Very good music. Very poor video quality.,"It was part of a generation that never ends. Nito is one of the greatest latin musicians. A cornerstone for the Argentinean rock scene. Every song on this concert is part of the history of music in Latin America. His voice better than ever and his amazing ability to set the ambiance for an unique experience is exceptional. For all of those who had experimented a live gig from him, this is a very good resemblance of the moments we have shared with him as an audience. My only complain is that the video quality is very poor and for an artist like him it is not acceptable to make this great musical job with this image quality."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this ""new"" group of Yardbirds really can rock. The old songs still sound great and the new ones and the old blues songs round out the CD nicely"
4,Great Stuff!,"Before Birdland, the Yardbirds got together for this live jam session. The result was a great evening of good playing of great tunes. Both the old and the new. The quality of the the recording is good though not great-but the material and the muscianship is what makes this a worthwhile purchase. There are limited copies out there so when you get a chance to pick it up you need to right away. These guys wrote some great songs. Oh, there version of ""sitting on top of the world"" here is fantastic!"
4,Yardbirds back and kickin' out the jams!,"I really didn't know what to expect when I got this disc but I was very impressed, not only with veterans Dreja and McCarty, but with the new memebers as well. They really turned out some great new/reworked stuff and the classic tracks make it seem like 1966 all over again! John Idan and Rod Demick carry the torch of tradition well and at times even surpass the likes of Jeff Beck and Paul Samwell-Smith! A great performance, an excellent mastering, and a welcome addition to ANY Yardbirds fan's collection! A real noveau-classic, and a high point of the Yardbirds' legacy! Get it now!"
1,Do not waste your time reading Factory of Death,"Shame on the editor that let this book see the light of day. The thoughts are jumbled, the prose awkward, and the grammar and punctuation often incorrect. The characters are poorly drawn stereotypes that stumble through a ridiculously overwrought plot.The one bright spot is that this book can forever serve aspiring writers as an example of what NOT to do."
1,Emerson CD Radio Tape - Model PD6870RD Poor Quality,"Emerson Digital Stereo CD Cassette Recorder Model PD6870RD is of poor quality, for the CD player either skips or won't play at all. The radio tuner will not play on the exact station number, you have to move one number up, example the local radio station is 99.7, you have to put on 99.8. The speakers are poor quality, no clear stereo sound. Overall, this is not a good product."
2,"Product was fine, while it lasted.",Product was okay until the CD player quit working one day after about a year of use. CDs won't spin. Also the radio antennae broke off and player is now useless.
2,Don't judge Greenleaf on this book,"I will admit that I am a HUGE fan of Stephen Greenleaf and he is the closest author who has come to capturing the magic of Ross MacDonald in my eyes.............but he is not as good as MacDonald. Sometimes he got close (his first two books - Grave Error and Death Bed - as well as his fifth book - Beyond Blame - got to MacDonald standards) but Toll Call was exceptionally ordinary.It was sleazy, dull, fanciful and generally boring. Not a normal Greenleaf at all.Avoid buying this book if you want to try Greenleaf for the first time."
4,Another Great Mystery in the Marshall Tanner Series,"This is another great addition to Stephen Greenleaf's Marshall Tanner series.In this mystery, a sex pervert is after Peggy, Marshall Tanner's secretary.Tanner continues to be a literate and well-read sleuth. This is a mystery forserious readers as well as mystery lovers."
4,Laughed and cried,I enjoyed reading this book and getting a more insightful view of the nursing profession. The stories of the patients problems and the nurses ways of dealing with those problems with humor are cause for good laughs and a more compassionate understanding of what goes on in hospitals. The first preview of this book in Amazon seems to be that of an English teacher. I did not hold the book up to such analytical review.
5,my dad,I had the honor to see this movie with my father. He is one of the seniors in the movie. He enjoyed every minute of it. Him and Pat got to be great friends. The funny thing about the movie was one day while they were fliming my dad had his shirt inside out they finally notice it and had him put it on right. And then the next day Pat had his sweater on inside out and thats how they filmed.
4,Weed Eater GA2010,"The item arrived a day early in good condition. It came with two adapters that would not work with my older weed eater blower.I used a foam huggie with the bottom of it out and two hose clamps, worked ok. I used it and it worked fine, it was a bit heavy and tippy it took me and my wife to use it."
1,gutter cleaner,The gutter cleaner attachment is not compatible with the blower that I purchased at the same time. I believe that had I purchased the items at a local store the sales person would have told me about it.
1,it doesnt fit!,"I bought this so i could use it with a toro rake and vac.model # 51573 It doesnt fit!!!! If anybody reads this and can get it to fit a toro of any type, please let us know. Im sure it works well with something, but the ad says it will fit ALL gas and electric blowers. Im a sucker!!!"
3,WEed eater gutter cleaner,I really didn't get a chance to use this because I purchased the wrong blower to go with this. You have to make sure you read which yard blower you have or purchase because this doesn't fit all sizes.
1,poor product,"This Weed eater product didn't attach properly to the blower, and even after I duct taped it still was unstable.When I used it , it blew water, dirt and debrie on my head.If you use it, be sure to use Eye protection.... unhappy in Ohio."
1,Do not buy it,"I bought this product a week ago with the hope it would work as it was shown in its ad, but it did not. First of all it is very hard to hook it up with any kind/make of blower. I had a gas blower and an electric blower. It did not fit with any one of those. Then I bought a third one from Lowe's and somehow connected with it but it did not do the job. My experience is that the blower does not handle the weight of pipes when air is blowing thru it. It simply knocks the pipes down from elbow. I tried my best to make it work but it did not.I would say its not worth spending money on it. If any one gives me suggestion how it works, I would appreciate it. I have one TORO and one Black & Decker electric blower and one gas blower."
3,Very handy,Works good for cleaning out rain gutters but would not fit the Weed Eater blower I purchased at the same time. I had to return and buy a different brand.
2,Unwieldy,Hard to use when you have to manage a blower as well. I have gone back to blowing off the top of a ladder instead.
5,WOW!!! ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!,"Could not be happier! So powerfull. No more ladders. No more paying someone to deleaf the gutters. Easy to assemble onto the lightweight Weed Eater blower. Had to hold the long tube with 2 hands so I got a wide belt and strapped the blower on. What an amazing product. If u need this, don't hesitate. It's worth every penny."
1,Don't waste your money -,"I read the reviews before purchasing this item, but no one mentioned how flimsy the material was. One gentleman did mention in the end he duct taped the attachment to his blower - that made me laugh. I wasn't laughing when I had to do the same thing to keep the unit from flying off every time I turned on the blower. I have four acres of land I maintain by myself so it's not a ""girl"" thing."
1,Junk Cleaner,This product was horrible. Continued to fall apart when fit together. Was not easy to stabilize over drain sprout.
2,Does not fit Ryobi or Black & Decker,The attachment to the blower unit did not fit either my Ryobi gas blower or my Black and Decker electric blower. I was able to make a temporary connection using duct tape to the electric blower for testing purposes. While it did blow the debris from the gutter it is somewhat clumsy to hold the vertical attachement during use. If possible you should attempt to confirm that the attachment fits your blower before buying it. I did see from other reviews that it did not fit a Toro either.
3,Not quite a fit,"I bought this product to work with my Poulan Pro blower, which is a sister to the Weed Eater. The tubing does not attach firmly into the blower head. Once I rigged a way to hold the tubing in place, this product worked incredibly well."
2,It usually works,The device was a little difficult to put together and cumbersome to hold once finished. It works as advertised if the leaves are completely dry and works terribly if the leaves are at all wet.
1,No Good for any thing other than a low ranch type home.,"Impossible to control with all attachments installed. I tried to use on my split level home which is a story and a half high and I could not keep the hose on the gutter. I am in good shape and plenty strong enough to hold it up there. However, once the blower get going it would shoot itself right out of position. Back to the ladder for me! Don't waste your time. It MIIGHT be okay for a single story home."
5,Good Product,This item received in good condition and was as described. Product fit perfectly and worked very well after getting used to the balance required to control it. Saves a lot of time and work in cleaning gutters. Will not work on all gas weed eater blowers. be sure that it will fit your blower before you buy.
2,"Not for ""All"" Situations",I purshased this product for the sole purpose of removing pine needles from my gutters. It is a well made product that fit correctly to my gas powered blower. It may work well for large leaf debris in your gutters; but it does not remove pine needles. The large and forcefull ammount of air at the delivery nozzle simply blows around the pine needles! It will be up for sale at my next garage sale.
3,Does not fit Echo blower,This blower attachment does not fit the Echo gas blower. The tube is too small a diameter to fit in the blower outlet. I had to glue a rubber mat around the tube to increase the outside diameter to get it to shove into the blower outlet and stay there.
4,Gutter cleaner,Work's good Work's good I like it works good work's good like it works good works good work's very good.
1,weed eater gutter tubes,I tried the tubes for 2 hours they were useless. I did not complain to the seller so I cant rate them. But the tubes are useless. Did not fit my weed eater leaf blower correctly. They will now just gather dust in my shed till I throw them out.
2,No adapter,"I bought a Weedeater featherlite FB25 blower to use with this gutter cleaning kit, and it will not work with it. All of the adapters are made for another type of tube, and will not work on this blower. The FB25 needs to be added to the list of blowers with which this will not work."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"this product claims that it will fit all blowers except 2. it will not! i have a poulan pro that it won't fit. same company makes both products. don't buy this on line or you will be screwed when it won't fit. you have to pay return shipping and a restocking charge because you believed the ficticious advertising claims of an unscrupulous seller. if you must have one, i'll be listing it on ebay as new, see other!!!!"
4,Oh this is safer and quick,"The rain gutter attachement has made gutter cleaning into a 10 minute effort. Takes more time to get the extension chord out and put up than to do the work. If using after rain then expect to get some smelly composted leaves on yourself, that's life. No ladders! safe walking and does an excellent job. Hard to find in the big stores."
1,Misleading Product Description,"Not correct when the ad says that it will work with all blowers.What they mean is ""all Weed Eater brand blowers""I saw many such re-viewer's comments (unfortunately) after my purchase.The supplier should include a 3"" x 3"" Rubber sleeve with clips so that buyers don't have to go searching for it Home Depot or Lowes..."
3,Adequate,"Very difficult to assemble, the manual is not clear on how to assemble. Also when tubes are fully extended it was very hard to control the tubes."
2,Disappointed with results,"Fit well on my older Toro blower. Had to fight the attachment to stay vertical once the blower was on. Worked well until it hit a pocket of wetter leaves and then it just blew wet leaves and water everywhere. I found it more of a hassle that what it was worth. I may give it another go, but it's a single story house and the ladder method is just as effective. Should have put the money towards some gutter guards!"
4,Beats Climbing a Ladder,"Overall, a handy tool for cleaning out gutters. Assembly was slightly confusing but not that difficult. It is easy to use. One tip: make sure there is no water in the gutter or it can become a real mess. I elected to buy this and remove all my leaf gutter guards which did not work that well and were unsightly. This product is effective and useful."
2,Weed Eater Blower Attachment,"This product just wouldn't stay together when being used, it come apart where it joins to the blower. The so called ""adapters"" that are supposed to fit ""all major brands"" stink!. Mind you, you're trying to balance this very long tube to overlook the gutter and also trying to keep the unit in one piece but as soon as you throttle up, it blows apart. I wound up using screws and bungy cords to hold it in one piece but it's still a handful. You can get away with something low but forget those secound story jobs. Good intentions, poor design."
5,It works great,"Does exactly what it says. It cleans the gutters perfectly.Very simple...it works. (By the way, I ordered this on line from Amazon at 4PM on Tuesday and the UPS man was at my house at 2PM on Wednesday. 22 hours from click to receipt. PERFECT!!!!"
3,Acceptable,Works as advertised. Fits my Sears Craftsmen blower perfectly. The contraption is a bit clumsy but with a little patience works fine. Better than getting a ladder and crawling on the roof. I feel anything over one story probably would be more of challenge.
3,Weed Eater gutter cleaning blower attachment,"I had been cleaning my gutters by climbing onto my roof with my electric leaf blower. That worked well and quickly, but it was dangerous, especially at my age (70). The Weed Eater gutter cleaning attachment with Weed Eater electric blower is much safer, since I can do the job from the ground. However, it is a bit cumbersome to use, and it's impossible to see into the gutters from the ground, so it's difficult to know when the job is completely done. Also, the debris fell down on top of me. That was not a problem, since the gutters were dry when I tried the attachment for the first time. It will be another matter when the gutters are wet.All in all, I'm glad I bought the product, despite the shortcomings. It's better than falling off the roof and breaking bones, or worse."
1,DOES NOT FIT TORO,"I ordered this thing because it said it fits all blowers. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. If the opening coming directly out of the blower is not circular, then it will not fit. My Toro electric has an ovoid opening, and none of the attachments or adapters fit. Again, it will ONLY work on a circular exit blower.What's worse, the seller has a 15% restock fee. This is a big loser for us. It cost us about $20 just to find out it won't work."
4,Real page turner,It was time for Kennedy. I couldn't put this book down I was so pleased at how they brought back your favorite characters from the Mamma Lou series and it was bad girl Kennedy's time and that man gave her a run for her money. If anyone has read the Momma Lou's series you are going to love this one.
1,"NOT 9/16"" and NOT 3/4"", it's a 1/2"" drill","I searched the internet for a drill with a chuck that could accept a drill shank larger than 1/2"". Both Home Depot and Tool King recommended the Makita line as they are advertised as being 3/4"" (unlike Amazon which calls them 9/16""). The Home Depot website says ""Chuck Size 3/4"". When the drill arrived I measured the chuck at 1/2"" and it is clearly stamped ""1/2-20"". A call to Makita verified that they do not make a chuck larger than a 1/2"" chuck. They call it a 3/4"" drill because ""it could drill a hole that big"". All my other hammer drills are American brands and they are all called 1/2"" drills even though, with a reduced shank bit, they could drill holes larger than 1/2"". My little 3/8"" drill can handle a 6"" hole saw, so should I call it a 6"" drill? If this is not false advertising on Makita's part, it is certainly confusing and misleading. I'm glad that Amazon is good about taking returns!"
4,One of the best ELO albums,"This is a much stronger album musically than most of what ELO produced in the years to follow, with the honourable exception of Out of the Blue. ""Eldorado"" is worth buying for Boy Blue alone."
5,Vintage ELO,"I'm a long-standing ELO fan and I can tell you that Eldorado is fantastic! Next to Out of the Blue, it is the most surprising ELO album I've ever listened to. Laredo Tornado is my very favorite with its blues influence. Make me think of New Orleans funerals -- until you get to the chorus, and then it's all ELO. Of course, the only way to listen to ELO is with the volume cranked up as high as the woofers and tweeters can stand and this album is supurb for that. You'll especially like the Eldorado Overture, Eldorado and Eldorado-Finale. A must own for ELO fans."
5,Awesome......to say the least!,"Eldorado must be the most under-rated music composition of all times. It is a story of a daydreamer. The composition of the music rivals works of masters such as Mozart, Brahms, and Handel. Reading Jeff Lynne's biography I have learned that one of his goals was to incorporate the sounds of the classic masters with rock and roll. He has definitely achieved that goal in Eldorado. In addition to achieving that goal, Jeff Lynne is also telling a story with this masterpiece. This is an essential addition for any music lover that likes the classics and rock and roll."
3,On There Way To Commercial Success!,"Prior to the release of Eldorado...ELO was virtually unknown to many. They were on there way to commercial success with this one. The single Can't Get It Out Of My Head was a breakout song for them and began a series of Top 40 hits. I for one prefer their classical rock songs. The top selections on this one are Laredo Tornado, Mister Kingdom (which sound very much like the Beatles), and Boy Blue. I still prefer their earlier CD's, but this one isn't bad!"
3,Somewhat shiny,"Sandwiched in between the compelling theme is a decent-sized portion of cold cuts, if not flavorful enough to warrant complete conceptual closure."
4,Cool pop symphony,"ELO was already a well-established group when this album came along. What set El Dorado apart from earlier works is that, rather than being a collection of singles, it devoloped and kept a central theme. Along the way there are some enormously popular songs (ie ""Can't Get It Out of My Head""). But what makes this album fun is the constant return to the El Dorado Theme. It's a near perfect union of power band and strings. Speaking of power, the bass drum gets a bit overbearing on this CD version, but it's still a great romp.Thrown in as a nice bonus at the end is an extended, instrumental piece in which the major musical themes, without vocals, are smurshed together into sort of a mini-suite. Since I was always frustrated with the shortness of the symphonic sections on the original album, this truly improves the album instead of simply filling up dead CD space, as is usually the case on re-releases.ELO fans typically love or hate this album. For me, it's love."
5,"Awesome, Awesome!","Eldorado is ELO's flagship album, at least to many people, and for good reason. Jeff Lynne and the band really showed that they have what it takes to ""compete"" in the AOR genre. ""Mister Kingdom"" is worth the price of admission alone. Highly recommended."
5,a whirled record....ELDORADO,"This album is seamless, flowing from one track unto the next, without jolt nor jilt. Best of them all in my estimation, like a greatest hits, maybe before ELO really had any hits to really dwell upon.The settings of the songs are mainly otherworldly, yes, but that only serves to take away the usual reference points of our conciousness which sometimes bind our imagination.This, I fathom over many years, without the need of mind-altering drugs!!! For those whom may indulge in something along these lines, well......... write, and let us know of your experience.t'wa la.......eric"
4,A guilty pleasure,"This has always been my favorite by ELO. I like their pseudo-orchestral stuff better than their visits to retro-rock-and-roll. The material that came later voyages too close to ordinary pop and disco.Listening to this album today is a guilty pleasure. I still love it! It sounds a little dated, and sometimes corny, but it's a great deal of fun."
4,Nice To Lsten To,"This is such a nice album to listen to. It' sort of like a fantasy and Jeff Lynne wrote some wonderful music, but if you're expecting some ""jump out of your seat"" great-hook songs ( with the exception of ""CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD"") that most people are used to hearing from ELO, you won't find it here. While this album is a good work of art by Lynne and the gang, just like it says on the title A SYMPHONY BY ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA, that pretty much sums it up and Lynne does a good job here. If you really like some orchestral music, in the realm of scores (which I do) then I highly recommend this, but if you the more cemented ELO sound, then I suggest FACE THE MUSIC as a good start.Highlights: ""ELDORADO OVERTURE"",""CAN'T GET IT OUT OF MY HEAD"",""POOR BOY GREENWOOD"",""ELDORADO"" and ""ELDORADO FINALE & INSTRUMENTAL MEDLEY"""
3,way too small - beware,"Those berets are tiny! I had to stretch mine. The quality is not excellent - but I guess, okay for the price.Wash only separately!!! It will stretch nicely, but you have to make sure you won`t overstretch it as I did mine...."
1,Wool Beret-Red,This was not the beret I ordered. I ordered the beret pictured for a child. The one I received was an adult hat. Very disappointed.
2,Did the trick for a costume but.....,The quality of the wool is very cheap. There are other colors woven into the wool which made the vibrant red color look like it was stained in patches. Since I ordered it just in time to wear at a French themed event I wore it anyway and it was fine and the price was right.
4,Beret wearing woman found the perfect beret on Amazon.com!,"I love berets! I have criteria though. It has to be wool, it has to fit just right and it has to be good quality! I seldom can find berets in the stores anymore so I checked out Amazon.com and came across this red beret and sent for it!I was not disappointed! The fit was perfect, the quality was good and every time I wear it, I feel good! Who doesn't want to wear a hat that makes them feel good?I was pleased with this purchase and would order more berets in others colors from this site."
1,horrible service!,I ordered this beret about 2.5 weeks before halloween (I planned to dress as a mime). I figured 2 weeks was enough time to get my package. I was not. I ordered another item on amazon in that same order. That item came about 1.5 weeks later. This beret arrived about 3 or more weeks later. I couldn't use it for my costume and it didnt fit! it was abnormally small but too large for a child. Overall it was a bust!
2,Not sure if my review counts...,"I did not keep the product because it arrived late and ultimately, it was of no use to me but the beret was as described."
5,wonderful message -great book!!,Love the book I know that God's Favor is highly important.If we do not know about it we will not get itwe need to know that all we have to do is ask for the favor of God to be on us and our families.the book came on time and is a easy read.
3,Well produced,"This CD is well produced, but not inspiring. The traditional tunes are overworked, as though the artists were tired of them and were forcing themselves to make the old tunes sound ""different.""Although there are many different artists on this CD, all the artists have a sameness to them. But the Hebrew and Sephardi pronunciations are very crisp, not dialectic.This CD is neither lively nor very much fun."
4,easy to use treatment,"cleaner works very well, but be sure to rinse runoff from the side of trailer, to avoid streaking. treatment went on very well, and seems to be lasting and coating very well, I would recommend the product to anyone. My trailer is 31 ft. long and it didn't use up all the product, probably have enough left to recoat next spring. I used a sponge mop and a paint roller pan."
3,Arrangements...,"I have to say first that I love BP. She's THE (into the woods) witch, she's Annie, she's everything! But I have to agree after listening to the sound clips that the music arrangements are very lackluster. The selection of songs was a bit drab and definitely needed more upbeat, happy numbers, like ""A Wonderful Guy"", ""Honey Bun"" or even ""I Enjoy Being a Girl"". It seemed like many of the songs were a bit slow or draggy, or just a bit too fast. Either take your time for the expression or cut loose and have fun, either way is good, but pick one!"
4,THE LONGEST YARD,"It's never easy to make a record of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN songs,because the shows are so linked in our memory.As it is often said that the RODGERS AND HART songs are better suited for individual singers(there is some truth to that theory)Apart from THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A DAME which goes over the top and YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE where the feeling gets lost,i enjoyed this record.My favorite here is IF I LOVED YOU which prooves that BERNADETTE can really sing.Cynics will tell you that this cd was made just because it is the 100th anniversary of RICHARD RODGERS'S birth.I don't intend to make you beleive that this is a recording you should absolutely buy,but it's a well come addition in the RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN canon."
3,"Classic songs, magnificent voice, deadly dull arrangements","When Ms. Peters pre-announced this album in late 2001 I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. After Irving Berlin, R&H have penned some of America's best loved tunes. And Ms. Peter's flawless performances are worth a listen, but I agree with other reviewers that Jonathan Tunick's arrangements are as bland as cardboard. Why didn't she work with her regular concert and musical theater conductor Marvin Larid who is a talent on par with the late Nelson Riddle? Or why not work with a proven pop producer like Richard Carpenter, Quincy Jones, or any one of scores of unknown but very capable Broadway theater arrangers? There are so few vocalists who can actually sing, any one of them would probably work for union scale to arrange a Bernadette Peters album. If you're looking for a good BP experience, I'd suggest the ""Annie Get Your Gun"" Broadway Cast Recording instead."
2,"Not Totally Awful, but She is Much Better than This","Bernadette Peters is a legend; one of the few true Broadway musical legends still performing today; and that's why it pains me to say that her latest album is also her weakest work.While her beautiful voice is still intact and capable of being as gorgeous as ever, she just doesn't seem to breath life into any of these songs. Even ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" -- two songs that beg for emotion -- don't even get near the credit they deserve. And during some of the tunes, her voice seems to almost crack, although it never quite does.I don't want to sound mean here. I love Bernadette Peters; but I also know she is much better than this album. Want proof? Purchase the cast recording of Gypsy :)Her masterful concert for PBS was done just a couple years earlier. It's almost hard to believe this is the same energetic and spunky singer.It's a grand night for singing? One wouldn't think so by listening to this."
3,Meh.,"I do love Bernadette, but this album really didn't do it for me. I found the material to be too familiar (do we really need another recording of ""Some Enchanted Evening""?) and some of her vocal choices were not great (I really didn't like ""The Gentleman is a Dope"" -- it's a wonderful song, but I found her rendition to be angry and strained). She also sounded tired, especially on the more uptempo songs.Not a terrible album, but not of the caliber that I would expect from an entertainer like Bernadette Peters."
1,"Sorry, Bernadette, I'm not impressed.","No new interpretations of these classic songs; in fact, they sound as tired as Bernadette Peters does. I guess I expected more, as I had trouble propping my head up during her renditions of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""It Might As Well Be Spring"". In fact, I liked Reba McEntire much better in ""Annie Get Your Gun""."
3,BP Sings R&H,"I agree that Peters is best experienced in concert. That said,her albums are intriguing & display interesting insights intofamiliar & not so familiar material. This R&H album has manygreat moments, including interesting takes on ""If I Loved You""""Some Enchanted Evening,"" ""Mr. Snow,"" ""Nothing like a Dame"" &others. On a few though, which I think are better served by more precise singing, I feel Peter's vibrato/waiver is a bit too much (""You'll Never walk Alone,"" ""Grand Night for Singing"" or""Out of My Dreams""). Overall, nice enough, but I prefer herSONDHEIM, ETC. & pop one I'LL BE YOUR BABY TONIGHT."
1,I Don't Get It!!!,"I just couldn't wait for this CD to be released and now I can't share all the enthusiasm I read about. I am highly disappointed because I consider it one of the most boring collections in years. There isn't one song in there that I haven't heard the original recording artist do better. I don't know what all the hoopla is about. I love R&H and BP, but this just doesn't cut it for me. (Reminds me of Julie Andrews and Ben Kingsley's recording of ""The King and I"". What a shame ... for all of us!)"
5,She's got it!,"Bernadette Peters gets it: in musical theatre the words are as important as the music. If you like your standards crooned like warm butter and spun silk, this may not be the cd for you. This incomprable musical theatre star gets to the heart of these classic songs and dispels the notion that Rodgers and Hammerstein shows are just fluffy musical-comedy."
2,Am I missing something?,"I received my copy of this CD the day after watching an American Masters bio of Richard Rogers, and I was psyched. I love Bernadette Peters and I adore Rogers & Hammerstein - but I was sorely disappointed in this album. All the way through it I kept having the feeling they had to wake Ms. Peters up between cuts. Even songs like ""It's a Grand Night for Singing"" had about as much spark as a wet match. The arrangements just did not do justice to either Ms. Peters or Rogers and Hammerstein.I feel like a traitor, but I just cannot recommend this CD."
5,Choice not Chore: The Delight of Moving,"So many of us dream of travel and Ann Cabot has turned that dream into a reality. Her book is a delightful combination of memoir and how-to when it comes to moving anywhere in the United States. As a single ""older"" woman, Cabot shows how anyone with enough curiosity and motivation can discover new places and people. Her personal whimsy and practical advice is an inspiration for anyone who wants to get on the road or just be an armchair traveler."
2,Disappointing,Too much of the author's personal experiences and not enough practical advice. How many times did we need to hear about each of her moves?
4,Pretty,"Lots of realistic (not cartoony) little butterfly stickers. They do have a bit of a white edge around them, which won't matter if you're sticking them on something white. If you do need to trim them, then do it before removing the sticker(s) from the page."
4,Nice stickers,Nice and colorful as pictured. I didn't know the package was going to be so small but all of the butterflies fit on the cards.
3,"Colors not so bright, but beautiful butterflies","You can use these butterflies as an ornament for your envelopes or gift wraps, but colors are not so bright, so I prefer not to use them in scrapbooking projects."
4,Great in stockings,"Great in stockings and if you want to give something small that isn't candy. Also, great encouragement for doing art projects especially if you include some pre-stamped blank postcards (perfect for a thank you note)."
4,maggie kate is great!,i love maggie kate sticker books. they are so colorful and i can use them on anything. they are great for decopage.
5,Very Rich & Complex Scent,These seem to be the best vanilla sticks I have ever burned.They have a very deep rich smell but I wouldn't call it pure vanilla. I find that they seem to have a hint of a licorice musk to them. If you could imagine vanilla-inspired licorice that is what I seem to feel this are accurately scented like.Overall: I really like it and it seems to be very sweet and smooth smelling while it burns- not so much a 'smoke' smell as most incense give. I use these sparingly as a 'treat' for the senses and will definitely buy more once they begin to dwindle.
5,How to hunt,"By the time I was old enough to hunt at, 12? - 13?- my father, who taught me to shoot, had lost most of his sight and couldn't help anymore. He did give me a copy of the Still Hunter, and I discovered Shots at Whitetails on my own. I absorbed everything the two authors wrote and, after to moving to Maine after schooling, applied those lessons. It took a few years to combine book learning with experience, but the lessons imbedded in the two books guided me and eventually, I became a pretty good hunter. When I shot my first deer, I did so exactly because of what I learned here. And I've gone on from there in the ensuing 30 years.I leave in two days for a deer hunt with my son, a good rifle man but not-yet a hunter, and I have ordered this book for him - I can give him some guidance, but who listens to his old man? Seeing it in print is more impressive. Between Mr.Kohler and me, though, I expect we'll do well."
2,Floats because foam is glued to it,"I work on a pontoon charter boat in the summer and thought these would be good for the boat. I bought mostly because they look good, but also because they ""float"".Look closely at the picture before you purchase, these glasses float because they have glued foam to the frames. You can see two chunks of this foam right next to the inside portion of the lens near the arm of the glasses. The glasses are OK, but if I knew that they had foam glued to them I would have bought a pair of Arnette's or Ray Ban's.Good polarized glasses,and they look cool, but feel like I was duped when they showed up with chunks of foam glued to them."
3,Informative and Detailed,"This book is informative and detailed, to the point of being too exhaustive and thus not for the average reader. For this, at times, I found it hard to read and had to skip sections and just read the conclusions.Overall, the book is provocative in the conclusions it draws."
3,Heavy reading,"Beware- this is really ""heavy"" reading. This is one book that could be enjoyed far more with better print quality. Does however,make very good and convincing arguements and points which are well supported. The print however is hard on the eyes and makes it a chore to read through it. If not for the really ineteresting content, I do not believe I would recomend it."
3,somewhat boring,The book was not as good as I thought it was going to be...I enjoyed Waiting to Exhale more. It could have been better
5,"This is such a great story, looks like it's time for a sequel","This book is so much fun to read. It's a fantasy event only deepened and made more fun by Stella's realistic assessment of her chances at love over 40. Terry made her heroine sexy and sassy, things I didn't associate much with women that age (I stand corrected, thanks!). I just read something that made me shake my head though. Based on the author's actual romance-turned-marriage, McMillan is accusing her now ex-husband of trying to ""humiliate and embarrass Terry McMillan and violate her privacy"" [...] Please, the guy was gay in Jamaica, closeted and probably did love her. From someone who made this romance public and made lots of money off of the ex, she's coming off like a bully who lost control. Hey, the best revenge would be writing a 'fictionalized' sequel, right?! Terry, let go already and get writing, we want you to get your groove back again!"
3,Enjoyable Light Reading,This was an enjoyable and comical story of an older woman going on vacation and having a fling with a young man. It was well written and the characters were well portrayed.
4,GOOD BOOK,A little unrealistic but that's good every once in a while. A little different than the movie but that's always the case.
2,Not enough dialogue,"Terry forces us to spend most of our time reading what's going on in Stella's head. Where's the romance? Where's the dialogue? Also, where's Winston??????? I can count on one hand the amount of times we got to read about actual interaction that was going on between them. Most of the book, he's AWOL and we're only reading about what Stella's thinking and feeling. Not quite my idea of a love story."
1,"Sorry, Terry...","Waiting to Exhale, Mama, and Disappearing Acts were better. I don't like to use the word ""hate"", but I DID hate this book. There was no substance. Hopefully, your next novel will be better."
4,A Fun Book to Take on Holiday,"This is a feel good book for all us older women who want to feel sexy and loved by a younger man. Of course it is pure fantasy but what fun I had reading it. I loved Stella, I loved Jamaica (well I spent my childhood there so I would) and I loved the gentle plot that never really went anywhere but was enjoyable all the same. McMillan certainly knows how to write a good fun book. Read this when you go on holiday, it will have you giggling and smiling in no time."
2,At least it was a fast read,"The only thing that saved this book in my opinion is that it was a quick read and I was able to finish it in time for my book club meeting.I thought the characters were vapid, the story unrealistic (I know it's loosely based on the author's life, but I still couldn't figure out how two people 21 years apart in age could fall in love after like 2 hours) and overall dull. I wasn't expecting much, and I didn't get much."
2,shallow with excruciating dialogue,"A romance novel set in the Caribbean, _How Stella Got Her Groove Back_ lacks even minimal believability. For readers of fantasy, the book is okay, but if you've ever been to Jamaica, heard Jamaicans speak or desire more than shallow scenes in your fiction, look elsewhere, perhaps to Russell Banks (_The Book of Jamaica_)or to Patricia Powell for sustenance. The dialogue on the part of Stella's love interest sounds entirely concocted from Harlequin. Disappointing not even so much for what it is but what it may inspire in others: vapid thinking about a complex culture and copycat novelists hoping to cash in on the same ticket."
1,maybe the movie will be better,"Terri what happened? Disappearing Acts, Mama, and WTE were way better than this. After the first 3 chapters, i had to put it down. I just couldnt get into it. Mama was my all time McMillian favorite. Why not make that one into a movie?"
5,RWeb1- EXCELLENT BOOK READ IT.,"This was my frist time every reading a book in just 2 days. I could not put the book down it was GREAT. To all the people that didn't like the book- DON'T TRY TO GO TO DEEP INTO THINGS, JUST ENJOY THE BOOK. As for run-on sentences - PLEASE, GET A LIFE, PEOPLE!"
2,Shallow.,"In one word: Shallow. The book was entirely superficial and the protagonist, Stella Payne, was no where near genuine. From page one, I could not relate to Stella. She is not like the average reader or the average AA single mother. Who exactly was McMillian's audience? Teenage girls? A fine fantasy novel without a message. I could say more, but why? I'm afraid to try reading any other McMillian novels...."
1,"Terry, please don't write another book.","I can't take it anymore. I liked Waiting to Exhale so I've read other McMillan books, but no more. We don't care about your May-December romance. There is no substance here. It just makes me sick that something so bad can make someone so undeserving millions!"
1,If only there was something on television.,"I would have put that book down a lot sooner if I had anything else to do that night. The characters were uninteresting; the story was flimsy at best, and the train-of-thought writing style gave me a headache. This book was not at all on level with her other works."
2,A perfect world,"Stella has a perfect body, a perfect son and a perfect house. She has a perfect job that she isn't really happy with but that is OK because she has made perfect investments and she is an talented artist so she doesn't need it. The only thing that she doesn't have is a perfect man so she goes on a perfect holiday and finds one. Is there anyone out there that can actually relate to anything that happens in this book? Reading this is like stumbling into the secret daydream fantasy of the author, you get the feeling that you shouldn't really be here and that these things would be best left to her own inner world. An uncomfortable book to read and one that I couldn't wait to finish."
1,PROBABLY THE WORST BOOK OF THE YEAR,"Hated the book!!! Terry McMillan doesn't or hasn't learned how to use punctuations in her writing of this book. It totally exhausted me just reading it. Never knew when to breathe. Books are supposed to be entertaining, interesting, en- lightening and enjoyable. None of the above can be said of this book. I couldn't wait to finish it and finally be able to put it down. If this is any indication about the author's writing, I will definitely never read any of her other books."
3,ENTERTAINING,"Entertaining and makes a difference, this time it is an older woman and a younger guy, yeah we women can do it too. but hated the bit about submissive down-trodden african women, get the little facts right Terry."
1,WHAT A WASTE !!!,"I found this book to be sooo boring. I bought it when it first came out in paperback and tried to read it. It was boring then. When the movie came out, and I saw the commericails (especially Whoopi), I tried again. What a waste of my time. The run-on sentences make the book very hard going, but the worst part was the people. I really did not care whether Stella ever got her groove back or not. She was shallow, and annoying. The other characters were flat, as was Stella. I love everything else Terry McMillan wrote, but this was terrible. I'm not even going to see the movie until it comes out on cable."
2,not as good as mama,"I was disappointed with this book. I found Terry McMillan's last two books to be rather whiny and full of complaints. After reading ""Mama"" I was expecting a writer to emerge that would be on the level of other great African American female writers like Toni Morrison or Alice Walker. Instead of the ""story teller"" that I expected, Terry McMillan has evolved as a writer of shallow, vapid situations that depict black women as whiny, angry and dependent on the men they claim they don't need."
4,Enjoyed the Book...,"I enjoyed the book, I was impressed with Stella's strengths. However, I was disappointed in the Movie. I sure many women can agree to enjoying a hot, steamy romance. Contending with, kids, a career and family is certainly enough to lose your grove. Hopefully, soon I will get my groove back!!!!!!!!"
4,I'm 17 and I loved it. Keep up the good work.,"I loved the book it was very interesting and I finished the whole book in a couple of days. I read all of your books except Mama(but I plan on reading it soon). You write really good books and I wish I had your talents. You are really down to earth and I can't wait for your next book. What's up with your sister Raslyn I read her book ""Knowing"" and I loved that as well. I can see you have a really talented family. Anyway keep up the good work and stay strong."
3,run-ons are a bit hard to follow...,"I loved waiting to exhale. I LIKE How Stella Got Her Groove Back. The run-on sentences make it very poetic, in a sense, but a little hard to follow. I like her bold use of language and her honesty. I really enjoy how she ties in all of these time markers. For example, the music, news, and books, as well as the current fashions/styles, and of course the way we speak..."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! WANT THE MOVIE NOW!,"This book was great, I loved it. I start many books rarely finish one, but I read this book in a couple of days and I enjoyed it. It is written the way I write and talk in ""run-on"" sentences. When I heard there was a movie I was excited, though I don't think it could beat the book!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,I have read all of McMillan's other books and assumed this one would be as interesting as her others. Boy was I wrong! This book has absolutely no plot whatsoever and I barely got past the first chapter. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of paying $23 for the hardback.
4,Has Terry McMillan written *all* over it.,"THis book was not one of her greatest works, but it was not bad as others percieved it to be. Sure, she talks about sex and""getting some."" Sure, she talks in run-on sentences. That's what makes the book unique. Without this poetic license, it would not be Terry McMillan!"
1,I Wish I Could Have Understood What I Just Read...,"If you like run on sentences, then this is the book for you. Because I couldn't get pass this, I didn't get pass chapter two. I'm sorry I bought the book. I have let several friends read it and they all thought is was another masterpiece of Terry, so I thought I would try again to read it. Needless to say, I still couldn't get pass the run on sentences. After hearing her read a passage from her book on the Oprah Winfrey show, I said I had to get this book and I also thought that maybe her reading style was just babbling, not her writing. It's the whole book. Terry, give me something that I can't put down, like Waiting to Exhale and Disappearing Acts this next time around."
1,"Oh come on, Terry.","I know that Terry McMillian can do better than ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"". The plot was simple and boring, as were the characters, and the story moved too slow. I can't possibly know how Hollywood is going to bring this book to the silver screen without boring the audience to death. I wonder why Mrs. McMillian doesn't write a screenplay for ""Mama"". That book was the best she has written, yet it is less mentioned."
1,Not worth the read,"This book is extremely shallow. Terry seemingly didn't put much thought nor effort into making this work even close to comparable to her other works. Sometimes it's best to wait and allow your creativity time to rejuvenate itself. But when you're rushing to sling out another book just to please the masses, the result will show the fruits, or should I say lack of fruit, of your labor. There was nothing memorable, nothing thought-provoking, nothing exciting about this book. When I finished it, my first thought was ""You've got to be kidding!"" And, sadly enough, she wasn't kidding. I like books rich in detail, history, and emotions. This book touched on neither for me. Terry, I'm willing to wait long enough for you to get the next one right. There's no hurry. We'll be here, that is, unless you produce another one like this one."
3,When does the next flight to Jamaica leave?,"It took me a few days to get into this book, but once I did, I couldn't believe I was finished with it. It wasn't as good as her previous three books, but we all slip now and then. The one thought that stayed on my mind once I got into the book was, ""I want a Winston just like Stella's (and not the cigarette)."
2,"Another ""Terry Mcmillanish"" novel","I think that Terry Mcmillan needs to start thinking beyond sex and materialism and start thinking about real life issues. I find her to be one of the most overrated, shallow-minded African American authors of the decade. McMillan makes 'Stella' and 'Exhale's main characters seem like sex-starved, middle-aged, middle-class, nymphos. I have read all of your novels and frankly Terry, I know you can do better than this for six million dollars(your publisher should have pressed for more quality instead of quantity). I agree with the previous reader who said that anybody with as much time on their hands as Terry does could've written this novel. Success has spoiled ol'girl no doubt. As a matter of fact, Ms. Mcmillan herself admits that this particular novel was rushed bragging that it only took her a month and a half to write it..."
1,Brutal,That's the most polite word I came up with to describe this piece of junk. Why are Terry McMillan's books so popular? Just once I would like her to write a book above sixth grade level. Just once.
3,A tawdry romance,"I admit it, I was disappointed in this book. The story wasn't a flowing page-turner for me. Just when I was about to get the groove of the writing style, I'd have to re-read a sentence to figure out the author's meaning. This happened every couple of pages or so for the first 200 pages. I understand why Ms. McMillan was writing without commas and using excessive run-ons, but for me, the technique was unsuccessful and really ruined what I hoped would be an easy, entertaining read. It's too bad that this was the first book I'd read by this author. I probably won't pick up anything written by her again."
2,What a letdown,"I was so looking forward to a novel about a Jamaican getaway, especially after having loved my own Jamaica trips. But Stella, who was so creative with home decor, was completely untouched by the beauty of the island and its interesting diverse people. This narcissistic so-and-so went on and on about stinky Rastas and ugly tourists and anyone who didn't happen to have a slim taut youthful physique. She indulged in too much reckless spending, and I felt sorry for poor Winston because I knew he'd rue the day he stepped off that plane in the U.S. and became Stella's midlife-crisis tool. He was much too good for her. Their values were so different, and she was just void of spirituality. Plus the run-on sentences drove so many of us readers crazy! Try reading McMillan's novel MAMA for convincingly 'real' characters that you'd like and would want to know."
2,Pretty Boring,"To me, each of Ms. McMillan's books get worse. I loved Mama and Disappearing Acts. Waiting to Exhale was o.k. This was like, ""WHATEVER."" The movie was MUCH better than the book. I wish people would stop comparing everybody to Terry McMillan. There are so MANY talented writers out there, each with their own identities. This book was not BAD, just mediocre. There was not a lot to this plot."
4,"Great Book, Lacking Film","I have been a two-time reader of Terry and I found STELLA to be almost as interesting as WAITING TO EXHALE. While the language had to be worked around, the description of the ""trips"" that Stella goes on is fantastic. This is where the movie lacked. We are not able to see the imagery that McMillan presents in the novel. STELLA just needs to be given a chance. The tale is great and describes the wonder and fantasy that truly comes with Jamaica. You Go Girl!!!"
1,Can we pick a new topic other than sex?,"This book was not good at all. I didn't like it. It had no ""pizzazz."" It was like drinking a flat pop. Not satisfying. I was highly disappointed.This book sends a negitive message about black women. We all don't have sex on the brain nor are we ""Trying to find a man.""Too much explicit sex. I don't think McMillon can write without being so vulgar. I think the only people who enjoyed this book were women 40 and over who are divorced and haven't ""had any"" in a long time. ""A fantasy.""This was a waste of my money and my precious time. I gave this book as a gift, in which I regret. If you want someting good to read and doesn't attract you with it's vulgarity and sex, Read ""Tryin to Sleep in the Bed you Made."" Now that's a goood book!"
3,Good!,"I listened to the audio recording of Terry McMillan's How Stella Got Her Groove Back, the one that Terry did the audio reading herself and while the story was good and I liked the characters and Terry did an okay job of doing the audio recording I felt she should have let a professional audiobook reader handle the narration instead. This sory is about a divorced single mother/ successful bussiness woman who goes on a trip to Jamaica and falls for a 20 year old guy named Winston and I found the story interesting and entertaining. This book is based on Terry McMillan's real life marriage to a younger man she had met on a trip to Jamaica though that marriage has ended badly and lets hope that the fictional relationship of Stella and Winston is a happier one!"
3,Not bad!,"Cute story. I enjoyed reading it. I'm an avid reader, so it takes a lot to get a 5 rating out of me, but all in all, I enjoyed the book."
5,Oh Yeah,"I saw the movie first, but I still liked the book, because it is an accurate account of Jamacia. When I picked up the book, which had been in my library for years, I had just come back from Jamaica. It's December in DC and the weather is the pits so I needed to feel the warmth of Jamacia. How Stella Got Her Groove Back did it for me. Negril Jamacia, if you have never been there, it is a must that you go and those of you who have been there need I say anymore. Read the book first if you haven't been, then go and get your groove on."
1,"BORING, BORING, BORING","This books lacks passion, and an interesting character. Stella is completely self-absorbed, much more interested in acquistions and 'brand' names than in anything with substance.She is shallow and has the attitude of an inept teeny booper."
1,Didn't care about the character of Stella,"I'm a big fan of Terry McMillan's other books, particularly Mama and Disappearing Acts. I cared about the characters. But it was hard to care about Stella. First of all, I'm fat and it seemed like on every couple of pages, particularly during her trip to Jamaica, she had to make a derogatory comment about a fat person. The repetition annoyed me. Every time Winston didn't call her, she would have this long diatribe about how much Winston was a jerk. Then he'd call with some excuse and she'd fall back into his arms. It got to be very boring. And what was with the lack of commas at times? Yikes. The whole book seemed to be written in a rush. Definitely not Terry McMillan's best."
1,This book gave me a headache of disgust.,"I read this book in hopes of understanding what it is about Terry McMillan that people love so much, and yet somehow I walked away feeling more muddled that before. Terry McMillan is not clever in her writing, her plot or her characters. I hated this book and I will never pick up one of her novels again."
1,What happened??? The worst written book!!,"I have read all of Terry's books, but for the life of me, I could not read this book. It is the worst written book I have ever tried to read! There are pages and pages in this book with NO punctuations PERIOD. Since I use my local library, I'm so glad that I did not pay for this book, I took it back in 2 days after I Tried to read it. I read Waiting to Exhale and HATED the movie! I only hope this movie is better than the book! Everyone is entitled to one mistake, and Terry, this is yours!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I READ THIS BOOK AND I DID NOT ENJOY IT. THE ONLY REASON WHY I FINISHED THE BOOK WAS BECAUSE I READ OTHER BOOKS BY TERRI, AND I WANTED TO GIVE HER A CHANCE TO REDEEM HERSELF. THIS BOOK WAS VERY CONFUSING, I THINK THAT TERRI DID AN EXCELLENT REVIEW OF HER OWN WORK WHEN SHE STATED THAT HER (TERRI'S)BOOKS IS NOT ""ALL THAT."""
2,Half of the book was enough,"The beginning of the book was nice and fun, the second half was redundant, since nothing interesting happened."
4,decent reading,"The book was good. The ending wrapped up kind of quick and was a little unrealistic, but overall the story was well written. The prose is kind of like stream of consciousness. It takes a little getting used to. After awhile you feel like the character is really talking to you. It's good for any woman who has gone through a tranistion or made an assesment of their life. Stella goes and does what we all wish we had the guts to do sometimes."
3,A nice book,"I liked this book. It wasn't the best book by McMillan that I've read, but it wasn't all that bad. The run-on sentences in the book was what kind of turned me off to it. But it makes sense because Stella is a woman always on the run. I guess the sentences reflect her thoughts. To me, the book was about fantasies. Everybody has their fantasies, and going to Jamaica and snagging a man half your age can be one of them. It's just a great book to read at the beach while eating chocolate--pure entertainment."
3,Ain't Love Grand!,"I enjoyed this book. It kept my interest, however not as intensely as Waiting to Exhale and Disappearing Acts. The story was so romantic and neat, but it seemed to drag sometimes. Overall, good job though. I have to say that in the movie version, the addition of Whoopie's character was a good choice. Kudos to whoever came up with that one!O.K. Ms. McMillan, I've read them all and I'm ready for the next one!"
1,"STUPID, STUPID, STUPID","If you are looking for a book with characters that you can identify with, that are fleshed-out, that have some integrity, spirituality and depth, forget this book.Stella is sophomoric, shallow and into conspicuous consumption. If you have no tastes of your own and want to know what Nikes to buy your teenager, what CD's are recommended, what books to read (including a little review of her previous book!)and what a wonderbra can do for you -- then you'll enjoy this book!This character is an insult - she's quite rich by most standards and filthy rich by single-mom standards yet in order to not forget where she came from she and her sisters speak blackese to each other. How about some volunteerism, or at least a check to a scholarship fund for gifted African-American kids? Believe me, that would never cross this character's little mind.The author's book has a catchy title and a glossy cover and nothing else."
5,EXCELLENT!!!!,"At first, I had a difficult time getting into it. I didn't think that I would like it. However, after several pages I was hooked. It is written in an unconventional manner, which by the end of the book I found to be refreshing. Thank you to the author for entertaining me so profoundly"
4,GOOD READ!!!!!GREAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK TOO HARD.....,"This book was a good read. I really didn't mind the run on sentences, it sort of left me with the impression that I was in her head at all times"
4,a kick-in-the-pants book about getting back into life!,"Stella, a 42 year-old, single mother from California seeks out a week of quiet time for herself in Jamaica and instead finds herself head-over-heels in love with a man half her age. She struggles with the usual ""oh he's too young for me what will my friends and family and son think about it"" stuff until she realizes that ""HEY! he's wonderful, kind, considerate, funny, intriguing and for some reason, he gives me my spirit back! why NOT go for it!""Sit, back, relax and enjoy Stella's journey back to her own best self!"
3,see the movie,"No dis to the book it was a good story, It was my story. Ha ha I know about older woman/younger man love. It's gooood."
2,"Older women, younger men, Big deal...","again, the writing left much to be desired...i've seen the graduate, even dated older women...and i wonder, what's the big deal?...the last older woman i was with was 52, i was 31...she was a nice woman, but i always felt like i was with my mom..."

4,It's an ISLAND HOLIDAY!!!,"Want a brief fantasy escape? That's my desription of this thoroughly enjoyable book. LOVE IT!!! If you are dreaming of an island getaway, but dont have the money or time to get away right now - here is your alternative. It's fun, light, dreamy and seductive. It's a blast!Thanks Terry!I am instant fan and have already raced to pick up her Day Late and a Dollar short! (Which I guess describes me for not getting to this great read earlier)"
2,The Joys Of A Younger Man,"For women of a ""certain age"" or a certain point in life, there is a growing doubt about attractiveness. These points differ with each woman. No one, male or female, can deny the rejuvinating and flattering affects of a relationship, particularly with a younger, attractive person. Save your money. We don't need to hear it again, if it be in an African American, Anglo or any other cultural setting. Save your money!"
2,shallow,"although the start of the novel was quite entertaining, i must say this did not last long. i realize the slang and all that is part of the whole novel, but after awhile I just can't follow along with the confusion. also, the character of stella is really strange if you think about it. is this realistic? i think not. good for those who want to fantasize."
1,Shallow Stella,"This book is so tiresome, it will put the reader in a rut. Ms. McMillan is far more concerned with being a label snob and a preoccupation with materialism and brands, then she is with character development. The characters were BORING BORING BORING---even in their brand name clothes listening to Seal, etc. This book reads like a commercial. ----unfortunately it is much longer than a commercial!"
3,Groove on Stella,"I think that initial reviews of this book were based on prior books by Terri McMillan. Although I found the story thoroughly engaging, the writing was a bit sloppy and the book did not seem to be proof-read as well as the previous novels. (As happens very commonly with writers once they progress past the sophmore project.)"
3,"Definetely not McMillan's best, but ok.","I picked up this book blindly, simply because it said Terry McMillan on it. I had read her previous books and enjoyed them all. And this book had also been made into a movie with Angela Basset.This book was a page turner, I did want to keep on reading to find out what was going to happen. However half way into the book I realized the plot was weak but kept on reading anyway.Also, I usually don't care about age difference in a relationship, but somehow in this book I didn't like it, maybe because she has a teenage son, it disturbed me that her boyfriend's age group was closer to her son's than hers. And I didn`t like that she introduced her son to her ""fling"" so early in the relationship.I will keep reading Terry McMillan's books, but I won't be so quick to pick it from the shelf."
3,Dissappearing Acts Was Terry's Best Yet!,"Stella was pretty good once you got into it. It dragged for a while in the begining. I just hope the movie is better than the book. Usually it is the other way around. I believe Terry will take time on her next book and do a better job, like she has done in the past."
4,I thought McMillan's book was a fresh break from before.,"I thought the book started off slow, but once I got into the book I could not put it down. Thisbook is different from Terry's previous novels.I think that's why I loved it. I also thought Stellawanted what all women wanted: the wholepackage, family, career, health, but most of alllove"
5,I loved this book!,"Stella seems to have it all: money, prestige, house, car, a son she adores...but no man to share her life with. So when her son goes off to spend time with his father, she uses this time to discover who she really is, and gets her ""groove"" back in the process. The book made me laugh out loud, and I could truly relate to the ""will he call? I hope he doesn't"" pendulum swing of her thoughts regarding Winston. She wants him so much, but doesn't want to want him, and doesn't want him to know how MUCH she wants him unless he wants her just as much....it's all too real. Her ""stream of consciousness"" writing style is not the typical writing you would expect in a book; however, it is fashioned after the way one might think things through in your own mind, without expressing them vocally. Stella discovered some very important things about herself in the end, and realized that she just needs to be herself in order to be happy. I can't wait for Terry McMillan's next book"
3,Romantic novels are not the forum for this author,"Much like Waiting to Exhale, the story line was somewhat weak. The characters seemed were too perfect and mature. Obviously the author has done a lot of deep thinking about life and wants to express her conclusions. As such she conjures up these characters with so much maturity that they have no growing to do. Perhaps a fiction novel is the wrong forum for this author to express her views. On the other hand this story was a light pleasant read and a little inspiring."
3,"It is the book version of Mary J. Blije's ""Real Love""","Once you overcome Stella's slight ""down with whitey"" attitude, the book gives you a real adventure. It is light summer reading at its best. Although at times McMillan underestimates her audience's ability to know what real love is, she manages to purvey her message of ""Love has no boundary."" If you are in the mood for a fun trip to Jamaica, you might want to check this one out."
1,PLEASE DON'T PITY ME!,"How can I even relate to this woman? She's gorgeous and rich, and a big complainer! Sure, rich divorced women have their problems, but ""finding yourself"" come on! She divorces her husband for really no good reason, and then she complains and makes fun of ""white whales"" on the beach. No thanks, I only got about a quarter way through the book, and the run-on sentences gave me a headache. I just cannot see an educated woman speaking this way. Glad I bought this book used...that way I didn't waste too much money. But of course, for this author, my money and time didn't seem to be important to her when writing this garbage."
1,decepcionante,"HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK TERRY McMILLANEsta novela esta escrita para salir del paso. Es uno de esos libros que leen durante los viajes y que luego a las dos semanas no recuerda uno de que tratan. La trama es bastante sencilla con un final bastante predecible. Se narra en primera persona y no representa un reto para el lector. El lector acostumbrado a pensar se encontrara con un pasa rato bien hecho, un dramon de mujer divorciada y sus crisis y conflictos de mediana edad y su enamoramiento de un joven mucho más joven que ella. No vale la pena el dinero que gaste en el.Luis Mendez"
1,Boooring!!!!!!,"Luckily I saw the movie the before reading the book, because I wouldn't have gone based on the book. The book had the complete opposite effect on me then ""Waiting to Exhale"". I enjoyed reading ""Waiting to Exhale"" but wasn't too crazy about the movie and with ""Stella"" I enjoyed the movie but hated the book.I'm a avid reader by nature and I had a very hard time reading this book, I had to force myself NOT to put it down, I could hardly wait until I was finished, it was far too long and too boring and it seemed that it was written in a rush, and the run-on sentences along with the rambling on and on was quite annoying. It seemed like Terry was trying to reach a quota for the amount of pages that had to be written.I would highly recommend the movie (which I saw 3 times) and I will buy the video when it comes out, but I give the book 2 thumbs down. Refund please!!!"
1,Trite and boring,"Adds nothing to the romance genre. The sex scenes aren't even interesting. What a self-absorbed, boring heroine. And a gormless, sappy hero. Materialism and narcissism rool, ok!"
4,A pretty good book once you get past the run on sentences,"Once you get past the run on sentences, ""How Stellas Got Her Grove Back"", was a pretty good, decent book to read. I read it over the Christmas Holidays and I don't reget one minute spent reading it. It was a different style of writing but one you could relate to if you are willing to stop and listen to yourself once in awhile. Can't wait for the movie to premiere. In my area we just started a book club and chose this book as the 1st one and we're planning to see the movie together. Here's to Stella!!!"
3,Falls off,"Like this product - it is exactly what it is protrayed to be. However, I've had a problem wtih the spacer clips opening and falling. It has happened a couple of times already but I've been fortunate enough to find them on the ground. Not sure why it won't stay closed but it's a matter of time before I lose it for good."
3,by and large the value of a cd-sampler,"patchy work that offers no requital as a whole since the only value is around the footage-inserts themselves--alas too brief.being of real value, most of the inserts could make good pointers for future exploration into archives. too bad nobody is bringing the original pieces back to life in their entirety. maybe this movie is another way for the studios to (see how much they can) squeeze out these gems."
5,"If you love piano, this is a must!","Wonderful video and audio of some of the great pianists of the last century. Each unique and interesting in his or her own way. Horowitz was so wonderful that my 10 year old daughter and I clapped after he played! I loved this DVD. If you play the piano, have aspirations or fantasies of greatness, you have to see this documentary. It was wonderful!"
1,Out of sync audio ruins potential treasure,This DVD is unwatchable. Its OK if I close my eyes. But that somehow defeats the purpose. I purchased two copies -- one as a gift -- and I'm returning both.I didn't notice comments about sync problems on the VHS. Is the VHS OK?
5,Artist's Perspective,I enjoyed the other pianist's comments of about fellow pianist's. Their detailed descriptions of playing styles are very interesting. Hoffman was great as was many others. This is the type of DVD that I enjoy watching over and over. The violin DVD is also very good.
3,Very Informative Without the boringness,This is a really nice dvd to own if you're a pianist or plan to become one. My jazz piano teacher told me to buy this dvd and watch certain players and how they play because i wasn't using my arm correctly. Watching their movements really helped me and I'm playing the right way now! So it's worth buying! Also some great music to listen to on your television.
4,Interesting Video of Great Players,"Great players playing and interesting commentary regarding what makes a great player. Daniel Barenboim provides some particularly cogent commentary. Rudolph Serkin was not profiled, but otherwise a complete survey of the big 20th Century pianists. Worth the time."
4,An impressive second effort,"Salisbury is just the second album from this legendary band and is a staggering improvement over the first. The collection of songs is dominated by the sixteen-minute title track, a monumental achievement in progressive rock which looks more and more impressive with the passage of the years, and ""Lady in Black"" the memorable acoustic singalong ballad that went on to become one of the bands most well-known and requested songs. A fine album whose only real drawback may be that with only six songs (seven in the remaster) it leaves Heep fans wanting more. The scary thing is that the band had yet to really hit their stride."
4,Very cute! A great debut!,"There are pleanty of plot sumamries already written here. I will cut straight to my opinion. MacKenzie is a great writer! She is funny and her characters are whitty. She takes time to develop the characters I think. The only thing that disappointed me a little was our hero's total lack of fear of his cousin in the begining of the book. When there is a direct threat to Sarah James reacts, but he didn't seem to worried about them being shot at the first time. All in all this is a great debut. It definately had the feeling of an older romance novel which suits me just fine! I would love to read a second installment with Lizzie, James' sister, and her story! I think we can all guess who she goes after, but I want to see if she gets him or if she meets Mr. Perfect along the way! It is a great author who can make me eagier for the next novel! Way to go Sally MacKenzie!"
3,cute debut,"Cute debut. The story was a bit far fetched, but very romantic. Especially if all men were like James. I truly loved the characters. I hope to be able to read more on this author. I was lucky enough to pick this up on a used book sale rack. *** 3 stars"
2,Nothing special,"It started out interesting enough, and held my attention, but by the last few chapters - I really didn't care... There wasn't very much character development, the plot was terribly light... And I didn't feel the chemistry nearly as much as in The Naked Earl. It was just an okay story. Nothing special."
2,Hopefully not her best,"I generally give an new author one shot. Unfortunately, I picked this book for Sally MacKenzie. The story would have better fit the releases of a much earlier time. None of the characters were developed properly. Both main characters were dull. The story was not believable. On the other hand, her writing/phraseology is excellent thereby showing potential. Hopefully, her newer books are better thought out. If you read only one book from new authors as I do, then I'd suggest not picking this one."
3,Great fun in the beginning.....,"I have to say, Ms. MacKenzie has a voice. She's very entertaining and fun to read, and if she hadn't had a ""ravishment"" scene of the heroine by the villain, and then such a quick recovery, I would have given 6 stars if I could. I loved this book. it had so much going for it. I rarely laugh at Regencies. I was laughing at this one. And then...that incident. And such a quick recovery? the nextthing I knew she was over it? I was annoyed, disappointed and a little bit tiffed. I had to wait a long time before I rated this. It was such a 5. And then it was such a 1. In the end, I'm going with 3. I'll check out her next one. Maybe."
4,Entertaining,This book was charming and it is refreshing to have the hero and the heroine both virgins and the fact that James reputation is of the worst rake makes it quite funny at times...the villan is a little over the top. Most villans do not fail in assassination attempts as many times as this one and still manage to get away with it.
5,Romantic Adventure,The Duke's cousin is crazy and plots his cousin demise. James the Duke of Alvord needs to marry and produce an hire -soon. When he finds Sarah Hamilton from American in his bed he thinks all his problems are solved - or not. Great first novel - off to find more of this author.
2,"Very uneven, not up to MZB's high standards","This reads like what it is: the bottom of the slush pile for S&S XVIII. There are some interesting ideas here, but no good STORIES. The editing is poor; there are many inconsistencies in storylines and ""spell-check"" proofreading, which completely destroys the meaning of the sentence, or even the story itself. I don't want to have to puzzle out what the author meant, that always take me out of a story. I finished the anthology last night and that's all I remember: misspelled words and grammatical errors on nearly every page.I see that the publishers are going to continue the series past XX, which I think is a mistake. It would have been better to let XIX stand in tribute to Marion Zimmer Bradley. Ms. Bradley was an excellent editor, which, sadly, the so-called editors of this book are manifestly NOT.I give it 2 stars for some of the ideas and because it's not wholly unreadable. However, I doubt I will waste my money on S&S XXI."
1,Obvious and pointless,"This unauthorized ""documentary"" is totally pointless. It's just a series of ""experts"" providing the details of every song on the album. None of which is any more insightful than what you've already experienced having had listened to OK COMPUTER a million times since its release back in 1997. Why are you telling us what we already know?"
5,Indispensible,"When we moved to Boston 7 years ago, we bought several 'how to get around' books. This was by far the most useful. Small enough to carry around, very concise, easy to read. We are just now needing to upgrade to the newer edition."
1,Book is excellent - Doctor is NOT,"This book is excellent. I do not know who wrote it because the Dr. Redmond I saw was a horrible man with a huge ego. The book I would recommend, the doctor I would not."
5,This is the only book you will need,"Dr. Redmond's book is the only book you will ever need if you are suffering from hormonal problems. I was suffering for years with various symptoms of hormonal dysfunction, such as adult acne, hair shedding, unwanted facial hair and problematic periods. I went to numerous physicians over the last 7 years and was constantly dismissed. I finally discovered Dr. Redmond, seeked proper treament and now my symptoms have been greatly controlled. Dr. Redmond's book is straight forward, caring and informative. It answers all questions thoroughly regarding alopecia, adult acne, unwanted hair, fatigue and more. This is an excellent addition to a physician's library collection, especially dermatologist, endocrinologist and general practioners. This book is written and structured in such a way that clinicians, physicians and clients can all understand and benefit from Dr. Redmond's extensive knowledge of hormones and proper treatment. I cannot recommend this book enough."
5,Terrific and important information,This book is a must if you are suffering from any hormonal imbalances.It is informative and well written.There are side bars with recaps to summarize the chapter that are really helpful. I'm taking notes and going to see my endocrinologist to discuss my options with my hormonal vurnerablities.
4,Pretty Good,Range of detection is pretty good. Easy to install. No complicated programming involved.Cons: Doesn't detect a police vehicle unless their radar is ON.All-in-all Good Product.
1,worthless,"I have now had this detector for three months. I purchased it because I have to go through a speed trap (speed unposted and the legal speed is only 25) to get to work. In that time I have encountered about twelve times there was a cop there with a radar/ laser - the Cobra 9430 detected TWO of those times. The only thing it seems to detect are automatic doors at stores, which it is very good at. I strongly suggest you purchase a different detector!"
5,i luv it,"this product came quickly than i expected , so i give delivery a 5 starthe laser detector is very good , very accurate , it beeps around construction site. i recommend it. just came from universal studio, i was cruising with ease."
1,It does'nt work!,"I purchased this product, every time I ran acrossed a cop running radar this product did not go off. Also when state troopers had cars pulled over running radar it didn't go off. Don' waste your money on this product, it really dosen't work!"
4,Cobra XRS-9430,"I have had this detector for few weeks now, and I am very happy with it. Though many things around town can set it off, such as store security systems, electronic crosswalk systems, and a few others, it has been very useful for my interstate driving as well as in town. The auto-mute function is an awesome feature."
4,Does what it says it'll do.,Got it out of the package. Ran it for about 30 seconds in my camcorder and presto! it all works great now.
1,The German Shepard Dog in Word and Picture,This book is actually titled The German Shepard Dog in Word and Picture (sheperd is spelled with an a) and is not written by the original Max Von Stephanitz. It is just somebody else's story about german shepherds and looks suspiciously like a rip off of the orginal book.
3,a bit disappointing,"i bought this mainly because it was written by maggie lane, whose needlepoint designs i love.the book is pretty primitive in terms of illustration and production. the photos are less than crystal clear.the patterns here are her interpretations of chinese style beaded necklaces. some of the necklaces are quite nice, and some of the ideas will probably find their way into my work some day. but, on the whole, unless you want to complete your collection of her published works, or have an overwhelming interest in making several chinese style necklaces, pass this one by."
5,Love it!,I bought this car for my 5 year old for exceeding expectations on his report card. It's so much fun and he loves it so now I want one for myself so we can race them at the park and I'll eventually buy a third one for my daughter when she turns 2 or 3.
5,Nephew was thrilled,"My nephew's school actually has several of these in their playground and all the kids basically have to wait for one to become available to ride.. He loved his very own. Also, the product is solid and very well built."
4,Old version?,"The PlasmaCar in the photo looks different from what the company is selling now (March 28, 2011). The back part of the seat is different. Can anybody who bought this item from Amazon comment on the look of their item? I don't want to receive an old version."
5,lots of fun !!!!,"I got this for my son's third bday, he loves it even though he has some trouble driving it, my 5 yr old got the hang of it very fast and zooms around in the kitchen(i have a big kitchen /dining area)we have yet to try it outdoors but the kids love riding on it around the house.Im ordering another one for my 5 yr old since they fight over this one.Very easy to put together."
4,Fun!,"Bought this Plasmacar for our Granddaughter. She loves it! It is a good alternative to riding a big wheel or bike, lots of fun. It does seem to work the best on a flat surface, rather than an incline. But she is getting really good at it. Just a fun toy to spend time on. I am sure she will enjoy it for a long time, as it is sturdy and able to support substantial weight so she won't outgrow it very rapidly. Good exercise and good way to get the kids outdoors."
3,If you are trying to decide between this and the flying turtle pick the flying turtle!,So I got this for my 5 year old and the flying turtle for my 7 year old. They are fighting over the flying turtle. It is much smoother and faster. Maybe I waited too long and my son is too old for the plasma car. It doesn't seem to work that great on the sidewalk or driveway. I wish I bought it at a store so I could return it and get another flying turtle.
4,Recommend,"When our daughter was 18 months we started looking for tricycles/cars and came across this one in a toy store. Unlike so many others, she sat on this and just started maneuvering around right away. It was designed to work naturally with her young abilities. It has had a lot of life too. My daughter is now 5 and fights over it with our 2 year old, so we bought another one.The only thing that has broken is a small cover plate on the steering wheel which doesn't effect the use of the Plasmacar."
3,Plasmacar pitfalls,"I purchased this yellow plasmacar for my nephew's 5th birthday. My nephew is too lightweight to make the front wheels touch the ground in order to get up some speed; (he weighs 46 lbs) however, he scooted around using his feet to push off and seemed to be happy. I also gave him a helmet for safety. His 15 year old brother jumped on and made it work correctly. They both had fun with it. I suggest that the child should weigh at least 55 lbs to really make use of it.The assembly was a bit challenging, and when the steering mechanism didn't seem to fit correctly, I called customer service and they told me to return it as defective and get a replacement. Although I had ordered it early, I didn't assemble it until 5 days before his birthday. Returning it was not an option. I called in a neighbor to help and we figured out what to do. Also, be sure that you have metric socket wrenches."
2,Quality Materials - Toy is lame,"Terms like ""lame"" are not often used by me, but it describes this toy perfectly. You get a lot for a low price in terms of materials, but the car doesn't work very well. My kids tricycle (Schwinn)Schwinn Roadster 12-Inch Trike (Blue)is many times better in terms of materials, quality, fun and usefulness."
3,my kid enjoyed it for a few days and back to his tricycle,"Look fun but not for long. The kid will get bore fast and not a lot of exercise. The wheels are plastic and will leave mark on the wood since the center of the wheels are sharp. Overall, I think bycicle is a much better than this."
2,A FLOP,"This isn't like the real Wiggle Racers---not a smooth ride at all. The kids complained it was too hard to get to roll.Also, the steering wheels fell off a few times. My husband finally gave up and threw them in the trash. This was a waste of my money FOR SURE."
4,Avid Leo Reader,I love this product and have been using this product for many years. It keeps my skin nice and soft. The cream is very silky and doesnt have any greasy residue when you put it on your skin.
2,A Disappointment,"In general, I was disappointed in the book. It was too farcical in the order of some of Terry Brooks books. Other than that, it was okay. I thought the Misenchanted Sword and With a Single Spell to be much better books."
5,Great Steamer,I have been using the steamer insert for months now and it is a great item. It fits perfectly into the pot and steams vegetables nicely and evenly.Would recommend to anyone.
5,Vagabond with Jrn Lande og Ronnie Le Tekr,Dreamteam! The best hardrock guitarist and the best hardrock vocalist in the world together. End of discussion! :)
2,no so great.,"these knives, while they have great weighting, are not particularly sharp. cutting through, say, an orange, requires moderate effort."
2,cheap,"Again, I purchased these for our son since he was in another state than we were, Amazon was the easiest way to purchase things for his new apartment and have them shipped quickly. He's informed that he was quite shocked that these knifes felt cheap. We have always used Henkel knives and have always been happy with them. It has been about 6 months since he's had them and he still uses them, so I'm guessing they are holding up."
2,"This ""Bible"" is not useful for advanced users.","It is a step above the ""Dummies"" books, but is not useful for advanced users. For example, memory management is not even in the index!"
1,"A big fat book , but you can't find the information","If one has a problem, the solution can't be easily found in the book. For example, do you wan't to learn about ""Safe Mode"", not in the index. Windows 98 has program ""System Tools"" , can't find it, nor can you find ""Maintenance"" . I really haven't been able to find much of help in the index ...although the information must be buried somewhere in a book as large as this one ."
1,Scam of the season,"I should have read the reviews. I paid $6.99 for two pieces of plastic (that I almost threw away when I opened it) and then another $5.00 for shipping!! I could have bought some adhesive plastic myself and cut out the nano shape. What a ripoff! These people should wear a mask and a gun! I wouldn't even give this thing ""1 star"" but amazon's review section doesn't have anything less. Beware!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!,Not worth the money. Crystal clear yea right I put it on and my screen is all fuzzy I barely could see the thing. This product is a RIPOFF!!!! It isnt even worth half a star!!!

1,Iliad,"Unfortunately, the antiquated language was too much to handle. If the book was interpreted in modern language, it would have been more enjoyable."
2,Difficult,Wasn't prepared for a translated epic. Would be better to read an interpreted story rather than the literal work that this book presents.
5,Best classic I've read in a few years,I love the way this book is written. It makes me feel good and happy. Homer is an amazing author and I can't wait to read the Iliad.
4,it's the odyssey.,"A readable adaptation for Kindle albeit in a somewhat dated voice due to the fact that it's an out-of-copyright translation. Still, you get what you pay for."
2,slow,"The story is to slow, didnt enjoy at all could hardly get the next pagewould not recommend to any one"
1,I'd rather pay for contents page and without intro,"It doesn't have contents page and has a really long intro, plus the words cannot be looked up in dictionary. I'd rather pay to have somebody put his in."
2,Why use this translation?,"Bloated and difficult to understand, I deleted this after the first ""chapter."" I downloaded this book because I recall reading and loving it in high school. However, I didn't need the detailed explanation of the translators history. I couldn't care less! All I wanted was the story of Odysseus, told simply and clearly. It wasn't here."
1,Bad Because of Formatting,"[by 10 year old daughter] This book is nearly unreadable because of the formatting. Yes, it's free, but not worth it. Formatting in poetry matters and, with this, you can't even figure out which lines are couplets."
3,The Odyssey,"Although I have read quite a number of great classic books, I found this one to be difficult to read. After a while, I decided to discountinue reading the book and come back to it at a later time."
3,yet another freebie!,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
2,"Disappointing--the text, nothing more!","How frustrating that Wildside Press didn't include more with their complete text of Pope's translation. Not only is there no mention of Fenton and Broome, the two men who actually translated 12 of the 24 books--not only are none of Broome's notes included, but there is no annotation whatever, no bibliography of recommended further reading, no criticism, not even a decent history of the translation or of Pope himself, aside from a single reductive paragraph by Theodore Alois Buckley (who edited the text and wrote the rather flowery introduction--in fact there isn't even a date for the introduction--it's Victorian but Wildside doesn't make that clear). Even the back cover is misleading, attributing a Samuel Johnson quote to the Odyssey, when it referred explicitly to the Iliad. Finally, there is no line-numbering, so this edition would be difficult to teach or reference in a paper. Not a scholarly edition."
2,"Warning, you guys! It's not the actual odyssey, just interpretation!",I got this book because it was required for my greek myth class and it was cheap. Little did i know that it wasn't the actual Odyssey book that everyone else was reading but an interpretation from some english guy explaining the story in his own words. I was pretty lost in my class since we are required to read out passage in front of the whole class.... Never gonna make this mistake again. Be very careful before ordering this one!
1,Do not buy this,Studio 10 was the biggest piece of junk that i've EVER purchased. I cannot believe that anything that this company produces is worthwile. Avoid at all costs.
1,Studio 11 Ultimate Impossible!,"Pinnacle Studio 11 Ultimate - What a horrible product! I have been successfully working with video for 5 years. I had Studio 8, which was satisfactory. I got a new system with lots of space and power. I run Windows XP Professional. I have spent the last 7 days trying to get this thing to render. No luck. I uninstalled, reinstalled, loaded every patch known to humanity. I rendered without even breathing. I rendered in most all formats. The last 30% of any slideshow refuses to render. Period. Support is a repetitive, cruel, circular trip to Hades. If someone paid me I would never use Pinnacle again. I am cutting my losses, and mailing the thing gratis back to the company with my opinion...not that they will ever find someone to actually read it."
1,"oh, all the hours and money I'd like back!","I began a recent project a year ago. It was a 30 minute long movie and it should have taken a month to edit. First, version 9 was what I was using and that screwed up sound and had really jerky and disfunctional playback. Then I blew money on 11. It definitely seems more stable than version 9, the playback is better and the sound works better in edit mode, but when burning it totally screwed up the sound balance of my movie. I worked on it way too long and spent more money on sound cards and the different sound options trying to get it to work. When the sound problem wasn't enough, it also decided to not burn the last minute of movie every time I tried to burn it. It even doesn't work when I break it up into 10-minute pieces. I am really tired of dealing with this software and would not recommend it unless you want to have heart problems, anger issues, and hair loss. Good luck finding something good- I'll probably be looking too!"
2,"GPU test, before you buy Pinnacle Studio 11 ULTIMATE","I find little difference between Studio 10 and Studio 11. The few improvements I noticed so far, are not worth the price. To be fair I have only used the program for 3 weeks and may possibly find other improvements in the future. The reason for writing this post is to warn everyone not buy Studio 11 Ultimate unless your computer's graphic card is able to handle VitaScene. This program was the main reason for my purchase of Studio 11 Ultimate . Before you buy perform a GPU test at www.prodad.com to see if your graphic card is ready for VitaScene. In order to upgrade your graphics card your computer must have a PCI Express slot. I have not been able to find PCI graphics cards that can handle VitaScene. If anyone knows where to find one that can, let me know. Thank you"
4,Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11,"Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11I've been using this product for about a month now. I used version 9xx for several years. Version 11 is much more stable; it maintains the same intuitive user interface; and in general, makes a rather complex process relatively simple. One caution: pay close attention to the RECOMMENDED system requirements (as opposed to the MINIMUM requirements). Any video editing package must necessarily utilize a lot of system horsepower and resources. So - unless you have the required system components - look to a more basic editing package."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Try the product before you buy it. Oh yeah, that's right -- they don't offer a trial version. Ask yourself why. Every other comparable product is offered as a trial version.My experience with this product, and the support behind it, was HORRIBLE and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Pinnacle 11 FRUSTRATING!!!!,You get a lot for what you pay. A lot of features and a lot of grief. It offered to let me download the 11.1 upgrade -- this resulted in an information free error message and a system lockup. The user interface is very unintuitive. I went to use the contrast/brightness feature and found they want me to pay another $49 for it! I can't believe that. If true I will return Studio 11 and go for Adobe Premier.
5,I like how Studio has improved since version 7,"I had used Studio 7 a number of years ago before switching to Roxio Videowave because of a deal on that software that promised to make DVD's easily. For those of you who have had troubles on Studio 11, try using Roxio instead and you will come running back to Studio 11. (Microsoft and Ulead products are ever more dismal) I upgraded when I bought a HD camcorder and can't believe I stuck it out with Roxio's worthless software for so long.Studio 11 Ultimate comes with far more content than I need so the complaints about having to purchase more fall on deaf ears here. For a home based person looking to make quality family video's, this is the best video editing software you can buy for a decent price."
5,Great Software,"Studio Ultimate is a very complete video editing package and based on my research the only one which comes with a green screen included. I jumped from version 9 to 11 and had no issues adapting to the new interface and the features. The Movingpicture plug-in works great although the documentation on this is poor. I did buy this for my Sony HDV camera and am impressed that Studio edits HD with such ease. Love the fact that I can go to HD DVD without having to buy an expensive burner or media. Checked the support site and they have an 11.1 beta out which offers the same burning capabilities for AVCHD and blueray players. One note: always check the Pinnacle site for patches and updates! Conclusion, I am very happy with this purchase and haven't had any issues."
1,Do Not Buy Anything From Pinnacle!,I purchased Studio 9 and ended up throwing it into the garbage. If they could release something as bad as Studio 9 I recommend not trusting these crooks again. You can find out more about Studio 9 by looking at the reviews.
1,Awful. Just Awful.,Pinnacle cannot render itself out of a paper bag. Not being able to correctly render your own project files is pretty pathetic.....
2,I give up,"I tried to make the hd movie from my JVC HD cam, frist, it can not detect my cam, second, too many code to enter to unknock the feature,third, not all of them work, it took me whole month and still to work on it, I tried every think to made it detect my cam, and it can not read tod format, I owen Pinacle 7,8,9,10 they all work good but the 11, forget the suport, it take you century to wait on the phone, and the answer of your question is reinstore, and still not work."
1,Much better free software available,"I wont dwell to long on this review. If you are serious about your editing then STAY AWAY from this product. Horrible at handling large files, which if your into HD video this can be a serious issue. To be completely honest there is free software available that will load and partially encode a video before Studio even gets the same video loaded after selecting it. Once it does load things do not get any better.This software is fine for someone who does not know better and any good reviews will be from those exact people. Save your money and look around for free, faster alternatives."
2,No Capture Card,"I was told that this software also came with a capture card for recording of devices via xbox 360 and of the sort, but it did not. Just wanted to let everyone know that you would have to spend an extra $50-100 more on a capture card."
1,Won't Even Install; Corrupted my Laptop-Stay Away from Pinnacle,"Pinnacle does not stand by its products or customers and this software is a nightmare. I got a new Dell Windows Vista laptop 3 months ago and loaded Pinnacle Studio 11 Ultimate. The installation kept crashing, something was wrong and my laptop stopped accepting Windows updates the same day that this happened. I spoke to Pinnacle support (if you want to call it that) for 12 days in a row, was transferred around so many times; representatives promised to call back and they did not-I even had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau to get them to call me. When they did call me they still could not fix the problem and refused to provide any kind of satisfactory resolution.Finally I returned the item for a refund but I still had to reformat my laptop to fix the problems caused by the damaged software. And you can imagine the time it took me to reformat...Never again."
3,Studio 11 Ultimate,"There are less problems in this package than in previous releases. The program still quits on occasion but not as often as the previous versions. It is still the easiest video editing program to use. You have to remember to do things in a specific order, ie, do not add music until end.I haven't tried to download HD yet so cannot comment about that at this time. Transitions are smooth, but was unable to unlock the free transitions. When I try, it hangs up the program. Haven't called customer service about that yet. They still haven't got all the kinks out but compared to 8 and 9, it is much better."
2,Pain in the But!!!!!!!!!!,"If you want an easy program to install, Studio plus11 & upgrade to Ultimate which I bought. Take some headache meds before handing this program. SoundSoap is such a pain to install, it has taken me 8 hours to try and figure out the authorized their stupid plug. Why can't they just say hear enjoy! No make us unstall & reinstall. But when you open plus 11, your not shure where the plugins are, and how to open Sounsoap? I bought this for the film and lighting effects. If I knew It would be such a pain I would have ever have bought it.. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
1,The only thing worse than the software is their service,"I bought this from a local retailer who has a ""no returns on open software"" policy. I can't even get it to install properly and now that it is open, of course, I can't return it. Tried calling Pinnacle's ""customer service"" line. Was on hold twice for more than 30 minutes each time. The people on the phone were very hard to understand and they knew nothing about the product, I mean absolutely nothing. I would have been better off asking my dog for help. Then I tried the live online chat help section on the website. The password they set up for me didn't work. Another 15 minute phone call to fix that, then I logged on to the chat line successfully. A guy started text-talking to me and after about 30 seconds, he paused and never came back. Beware of this product. If you need support, you are on your own.I wish Amazon would allow a zero stars rating because that's what this software deserves."
2,it crashes,"Nice features, and, indeed, it is more stable than the previous releases. But is not accettably stable yet.The overall behaviour is giving the impression that the application is fatiguing through the various tasks. However, what I find really problematic are the several crashes that, despite the improved stability, still occur. Be ready to accept to invest time in recovering the works after the various crashes rather than focusing in the actual creative process. For those who, like me, don't have the luxury of doing this as a full time job, every minute counts, and it is easy to have unproductive sessions for quite a few times."
2,"Perfect software, terribly made","I've had this software for over a year and it has all the features you need with a perfect interface for getting an amazing video done with both quality and speed. Only problem is this little bugger has crashed as many as 6 times on a single video project. Not only the crashing, but once i finish the video, 8 times out of 10 it fails to save the video file and i have to go back and basically make my video from scratch and hope it works next time.If it worked properly it'd be the only software you'd ever need, only problem is it doesn't~Vista 64 bit with specs way beyond the minimum the box says it needs to run."
4,"A bargain for good functionality, and a basis for updating.","An old version is a real bargain. It has lots of functionality, and does everything I need -- and more."
1,WORST SOFTWARE EVER CREATED,"I usually don't take the time to rate software but I can't believe Pinnacle has this version on the market, it is the buggiest, most unstable software I have used in 10 years. Studio 9 was more stable than this. If you contact tech support they tell you your operating system is corrupt (when it is not) and they tell you to reinstall your OS!!!!!I seriously don't believe that Pinnacle can release this trash with a straight face -- and furthermore, do nothing to support it. Save your money and more importantly the hours of frustration you will experience if you get this."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!,"If I was able, I would give this worthless program negative stars. Go ahead and buy it if you desire a program that:crashes at random intervalsreplaces the videos that you placed in your creation with ones that IT choses.changes the timing of slides and transitions on whim....after you have set them.did I mention crashes?if you like restarting your computer mutliple times while trying to create presentation.spending at least four times as much time as needed creating a simple program due to crashes restarts.hangs up while playing it's own files!!!!!This program is terrible. It was apparently written by crack smoking monkeys who were hung over and in need of a fix.DO NOT BUY IT !!!!"
2,What can I say...it still doesnt work well,"We have stuck with Studio since version 9. The interface is great and it has so much promise. However, we are constantly pulling our hair out over features that should just work....yet don't.Perhaps it is just our pc? It isn't the fastest but it is no slouch either. We aren't even editing hi-def movies (!) It is frustrating that we are still left in a video editing limbo.Maybe the problems will be patched in later updates, but from our past and current experience, we are as ever left disappointed... and using an old copy of ShowBiz, that at least does what it is meant to do!"
5,Works great!,Does a great job and is reasonably fast on my 2.8GHZ P4 with 1GB RAM. Has the best menu editor I've tried and the video editing capabilities are at least as good as anything else I've tried. I particularly like the ease of interfacing the video with the menu.
1,HEADACHE NO1,YOUR HEADACHE PINNACLE SOFTWARE NEVER IN MY LIVE I GET 10% OF THIS HEADACHE AND IF YOU SEARCH IN YOU WILL FOUND PLENTY CUSTOMERS GETED HEADACHE .NO RATE ONLY 0
3,AVCHD Support,I bought only because they calimed support for avchd. It turns out it reads it but does not output in avcahd or writes to blue ray. That will come on a later upgrade.Bad business.
1,Wouldn't recommend,"Crash, Crash, Crash...not to mention everytime you turn around you're required to purchase some addition. I have a powerhouse pc, 500gb HD, 3 gig ram, DELL XPS, vista home. Bought Ulead and although not many bells and whistles, it works well, and there are no crashes."
1,"Worked just one time, then quit","I applied the glue as directed, then waited 24 hours before trying. The first time I turned on the defroster, it worked just fine. But it never worked again. The glue is still holding, but the defroster doesn't work at all now."
1,Loctite Rear Window Defogger Tab Adhesive,Instructions were clear and specific and easy to follow. The adhesive quality was good. The conductive quality is not. The rear defrost no longer clears the rear window.
1,Absolute Junk.,"After TWICE following the directions to a T, the adhesive failed to harden-except to my fingers. Wasn't even the least bit tacky on the window. I washed the window 4 times and let it sit for 20 mins and I had a stopwatch timing the drying time of the activator the second time around, and still nothing. Wasted 12 bucks on this crap-should have purchased the 25 dollar Frost Fighter epoxy the first time..."
1,Don't waste your money!,Did EXACTLY as the directions indicated and the tab fell off within 24 hours after putting the connector back on. I even let it sit for several days just to make sure the glue cured. I wish I had kept my reciept!
1,This stuff is junk.,"I have tried this product about 6 times on two different cars, both Saturns, following the instructions to the letter. The last time I used it I had an almost surgical cleanliness. I did do the extra steps with rubbing alcohol and heated the glass with a space heater in my garage. It lasted about a year, then just fell off the window. I have had several different outcomes, all bad. Sometimes it would work, but only for a year at the most. About half the time it would bond, but not conduct. I need to have my defroster working consistently, so I broke down and got the really expensive silver epoxy. So far so good with that one."
1,"good company, bad result","Product did not solve the problem, but company offered to replace the product. Good customer service."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The first time I tried this stuff on my daughter's car I followed the instructions to the letter. I actually gave it an extra day before attaching the defroster wire, but the tab popped right off the window. Adhesive was still gooey after all that time. As another reviewer stated, I also thought maybe I got an old batch so I tried a second time. All seemed to go well, and this morning was the first chance to try it.. 11 degrees outside and frost on the glass. I turned it on, and after 3 minutes it had no effect. I looked at it from the outside of the glass and the area under the tab had a bright orange glow (not arcing, but glowing orange!). I immediately shut the defroster off and left for work, telling my daughter not to use it.. she calls me 20 minutes later and tells me that when she went outside, the entire rear window had shattered and fallen into the car. This stuff is obviously more resistive than they claim... $400 mistake.. thanks Permatex"
1,"Followed instructions, didn't work.","Temperature 65 degrees. Window attachment area and tab cleaned with light emery cloth and alchol. Activator applied and allowed to dry for 5 minutes (spent the time kneeding the adhesive). Applied adhesive, pressed tab to surface, held firm for 1 min. Tab fell away immediately.Followed 1st reviewer's lead... stuck tab with supergle then used a small dot of solder. If I would have read that first, I probably could have fixed this months ago with less effort and cost.Bad news. Don't buy it."
1,Permatex Adhesive Bust!,I followed directions and the product did not work at all.I would not recommend it at all. A waste of my money.
3,only as good as its title track,"This singer is on the annual Japanese New Year's singing extravaganza, singing this title song, my mom's favorite of all time. Don't expect any of the other songs to impress you - she says they're just remakes of other songs by other people. She's planning on downloading just this song into her iPod so she can play it over - and over - and over."
4,Vodka Lemon,It's a wonderful film full of magical realism and poignancy.I receiived it promptly and in perfect condition.
1,doesnt fit,"too small on the bottom, too big at the top. I ordered two of these in two different sizes and they are both the same way. Don't order these, you won't be happy. ---Trying to return them is a nightmare"
2,Lacks contrast,"Lighstcribe labeling is a great way to create beautiful images on your disks using your own photos and text. However, do not purchase this product if you want to see the best quality. I previously used Verbatim DVD media and my images printed very crisp and dark. Using the TDK media I lost a significant amount of contrast. If you want your images to look good, try a different brand."
2,Lightscribe DVD,"I was a little disappointed in this product. These disks don't seem to take the pictures as well. Also, my computer has a hard time reading them for some reason. I don't think I would buy them again."
2,Faded lightscribe images,"I have to agree with others on the faded images and lack of contract on the discs. The HP Lightscribe CD-Rs I use look great and look even better when I burn the same image twice to increase the contrast.But with these TDK discs, the image is very faded and burning multiple times on the same disc doesn't help with contrast either.Burning data on the disc seems fine though, so at least that works as expected.Will buy another brand of Lightscribe DVD+Rs in the future."
2,Too light,"LightScribe is a great way to label your DVDs and CDs. Unfortunately, these disks burn very lightly. Things don't show up, which defeats the purpose. I'd spend a little more for a disk that burns darker."
1,"DVD Good, Lightscribe Awful","These DVD's burn correctly, so they're fine as blank media.The Lightscribe function is horrible, though. I've used 3 burners, and all come out the same - very light and not terribly clear, extremely difficult to read. The printing looks like it's on the other side of a sheet of smoke-colored plastic.I strongly recommend against buying these if you're planning on Lightscribing them."
5,owesome product. I just love it,I donot care what others are saying about for this product. I think it is great and cheap. I bought 5 of 30 packs. I use my lightscribe dvd burner to burn so many dvds. they looks great. I do not need to write these no-proefessional looks marks on dvd anyway. great product!!!
5,"Great price, but Amazon shipping sucks!","Don't know when I'll be receiving this. Amazon has very bad shipping habits. Say they're mailing it out via USPS and provide a USPS tracking number. The when checking the USPS site, the tracking number is invalid! Customer support says it was handed off to FedEX! Which will inturn hand it off to my local USPS office, to be delivered to me.DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON!"
4,Good strong Debut,"Cheryl Lynn is One of the Most Slept on Female Vocalists Ever. talk about Range&Energy to Burn? I mean she covers so much territory&Can Wail. ""Got To Be Real"" is a cut that is timeless. it never gets old. the Groove still bumps as does ""Star Love"". to hear the many runs that cheryl Lynn on that song alone shows you that the Beyonce's,&Christina's of today would get ran out of a studio if they had to keep up with Cheryl Lynn. the Cats from Toto along with Ray Parker Jr worked with her&they all struck a powerful chord that is felt on this Album. a very strong debut."
5,"DEFINITELY, IN MY ALL-TIME, TOP 5 !!!","I bought this album when Cheryl first released it simply for the song "" Got To Be Real"" . I had no idea how talented this lady was until I heard the rest of the cuts. ""Star Love, You're The One, and Daybreak"" are absolutely fantastic! I hope to hear more from this disco diva in the future."
5,30 years on,"this is still Huntington's best work. The bredth of his erudition is astounding, the clarity of his analysis second to none. Too bad he had to soil his reputation with all that later nonsense about clashing civilizations."
1,Very wrong to description.,Picture was of newer edition. Said slightly used but the book was from the 1960s. Very disappointing.
5,Nambe Vase,I don't own too many vases but I like beautiful things.This is beautiful without any flowers in it. Try the dried woody plants for a great look.
1,Sacred Spirit,"Well, they used some Native Americans in this collection but this is hardly the real sound of our people. Very pretentious attempt.Over synthesize junk. I don't know who the ""the Fearsome Brave"" is but I suspect it's some gringo.Save your money."
3,"Drys fast, no greasy feel, lasts several hours","This is a pretty good product I would buy again. It is pretty expensive but you get a good bit and a little goes a long way. I use this to hydrate my face because the Retin A makes my face look like a leper. Works well but repeated use is needed to last the whole day.Found a MUCH better product. Clinique can't even compare to this:Dr. Denese HydroShield Ultra Moisturizing Face Serum, Super Size 2 fl. oz. (60 ml)"
2,Step by step into the abyss,"This book didn't click with me. There were no aha moments. ""Let's review how check boxes work; let's look at Radio Buttons."" I'm gonna try Francesco Balena's book next."
5,Best Introduction to VB.NET out there....,"I have toyed around with Java and PHP and some Visual Basic 6. I knew the craze surrounding VB.NET was strong so I took up this book. One of the best purchases I've made, to be sure. It's simplified so you get your feet wet, and then goes on into more indepth topics. It's a bit lean on the DataView (sorting and filtering, etc) but other than that I applaud this Holzner. Great piece of work."
2,From a new programmer,"I did like that this book is geared towards people who have no visual basic knowledge. However, I did not like the fact that it assumed you have a version of visual basic.net that is not standard (Proffesional or Enterprise.) All of the database examples use a database that comes with ms sql server 2000 which just so happens to not be usable by vb.net standard. Maybe the name of this book should have been ""Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Visual Basic.NET 2003 (as long as it isn't standard version) in 21 days."
1,Not for the beginner,"Are you new to programming? If yes, then Visual Basic is a great place to start. This book, however, is not. The first day introduces you to the Integrated Development Environment. From that point forward, it's all about the code. This is a good book for slightly more advanced programmers instead of newbies, but I feel the title is very miss leading. If you are new to programming and want to lean Visual Basic.Net 2003, try Microsoft Visual Basic .Net Step by Step written by Michael Halvorson (ISBN 0735619050). It is a much better place to start for the true beginner.After you have gone through the step-by-step book, come back to this one. It really is a good book. (Score should have been a 4 not a 1.)"
4,Solid book,"I won't give this book 1 star simply because there is an error in it. At that rate all the books would only get a star. No, this book teaches the exciting new language Visual Basic.Net and does a good job of it. After 21 days you will not be an expert programmer (it takes more than 21 days to become an expert in any field), but you will have a solid foundation to build on. You will have covered all the basics, and better yet will have an ideah on finding solutions to your problems."
1,Think twice about this book,"I purchased this book to have some extra problems to work on. I am a student in the UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering Department. Sure, they have hundreds of problems to solve, but few are actually insightful. The problems are extremely similar to each other (often changing resistors) and are very trite (many of the problems are the same bias point calculation over and over again). Moreover, the discussions of big ideas and ""problem solving strategies"" are lacking to say the best. They gloss over fundamental facts and approaches to problems. The book also uses outdated notation. In some instances, instead of using Beta for the current gain in a bipolar transistor, h_fe is used. Additionally, there are not any technologically current problems in this book. All in all, I think this book is a big waste of paper and regret purchasing it."
2,Badly in need of an update,"Although there were some pretty useful chapters and problems, I mostly felt that this book is largely outdated. In particular, it barely covered CMOS devices and circuits, which, to me was a significant drawback. I agree with the other reviewer too that the nature of the problems were sometimes repetitive."
1,Cover doesn't stay closed,"Cover doesn't stay closed and ordered a size 10 thinking it would be about 1.5"" turns out twice as big."
5,Perfect non-stick gauze - amazing!,I had a C-section and was told to keep my incision clean and dry. I used Telfa to cover it. I never had to deal with the discomfort of gauze sticking to my wound - literally not once. Grateful for this product and recommend it eagerly!
2,Very thin,I've seen this brand in hospitals so I thought it would be good for wound care. I needed the non-stick but the pad itself was very thin. I wouldn't order it again. I'd stay with a thicker pad. I was disappointed.
1,Warning Latex,"I bought these bandages for an aging relative who is allergic to latex. There is no warning on the box and no warning in the merchant's advertisement, however the individually wrapped bandages have a warning stating the the packaging contains latex. You don't know this until you open the box and take out one of the bandages. The merchant has suggested that I return them but if they are not defective, they will deduct the shipping charges and the Amazon fee from my refund. They are not defective, but due to the wrapping, everyone of the individually wrapped bandages are exposed to latex. I don't know if this is a significant risk, but we are not going to take the chance. My concern is more for the potential health hazard than for the money. Before ordering, we should have known that the bandages are wrapped in packages containing latex."
1,I would not wish this CD on my worst enemy,"""The Land Beyond the Mountains"" drips with dread and spews wretchedness. No joy or light escape from this sonic black hole. I would not wish this CD on my worst enemy.The chief characteristics of this recording are its fetid, foul production highlighted by hideous, disturbing background noise (clearly intentional); downer, droning music; and gnarled, distorted sneers for vocals. The track called (I am in) hell sums up the listening experience precisely.Stay away from anyone who purports to like this depressing, dreadful montage. I may take a screwdriver to this CD to render it unplayable."
2,unhappy,"....the 2 CD's are loaded with old, seldom-played, and to the average listener, unknown numbers! i am very disappointed and feel i wasted my money!"
4,Old Good Music,"This music entered in my DNA. I was 11 when I first Knew this group. I had two LPs, ""Demonds and Wizards"" and ""Magicians Birthday"". I would prefer having the original record, with its excellent sound and It is not my favourite selection but this is an acceptable form.Uriah Heep - Greatest Hits"
5,An American Classic Sings All Time Favorites,"For his volume 2 of 'All Time Favorites' Glenn has chosen a selection of twelve songs much better suited for his classic tenor voice than he did for volume 1.Along with the inclusion of his longtime signature song, 'Baby The Rain Must Fall', Glenn also scores high marks on his versions of 'Somewhere My Love', 'Always On My Mind', the beloved classic 'Green Green Grass Of Home' and 'Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain' in which he includes some of his wonderfully melodic whistling.If you liked volume 1, you'll love volume 2!"
2,Arrangements all wrong,"I have been a big fan of Glenn's since the 60's and have every album he ever made. I always thought I could love hearing him sing the phone book; I was wrong. These are great songs but whoever did the musical arrangements really messed up. The tempo, the back up singers, the muscicians are NOT right for any of these songs. Glenn's voice is beautiful but I find it almost painful to listen to his beautiful voice singing great songs that are musically ALL wrong. What a waste of a great voice."
2,Not the all-time Yarbrough favorites,"What is disappointing about this is that it only has one of the Glenn Yarbrough classics: ""Baby, the Rain Must Fall."" The others are covers of songs made famous by Willie Nelson and other performers. Some of the arrangements are incongruous: there's a western sway to the Dr. Zhivago theme song, for example."
4,Great romance,"This is another wonderful, insightful and thoughtprovoking book by KG MacGregor. I esp. loved the characters and how KG makes them totally real. Very well done! Small town living is rediscovered."
2,"Performance A+, Reissue F-","I agree with another reviewer about the quality. Wasn't the LP also in stereo? Glenn is one of the best, and so is this performance."
5,After all these years Glenn Yarbrough is still great.,What a pleasure to hear these songs again. The remastering is terrific. This is a fun recording which everyone should get a chance to hear.
5,Signature album FINALLY available on CD!,"This concept album was a signature work in 1972. From the album cover - conceived by Charles himself, to the review of contemporary social commentaries, to the timeless rendition of America The Beautiful. This is a great album, not only in execution and Charles' incredible musicianship, but also makes a great statement to, and for, all of us. The ""Message From The People"" is still applicable today, and it's exhilarating to hear a Master Artist speak so well on our behalf."
1,Ray Charles,This will be the second time that I have purchased America The Beautiful without receiving it. I would like to get someone at Amazon interested in this criminal activity. I am getting very pissed.
3,OK...,"For the price, it's not that bad. The cover is rather flimsy and if you're running thick gauge wire through it, it'll show. Nothing that tape won't solve, however! If you're looking for something basic, this is it. If you're concerned about potential looks, find something else!"
2,ANL fuseholder,The Scosche EWFH ANL fuse holder is intended for larger fuses (presumably large currents). The plastic molding is very thin and consequently the overall construction is extremely flimsy making the fuse holder unsuitable for large currents. Due to the plastic molding being very thin the stud mounting is very weak and will be unreliable if not tightened very carefully. If any significant heat were to be generated due to large currents the molding would quickly distort or even melt.I would not recommend this fuse holder for high current applications.
1,missing the 24k fuse arrived incomplete !,"I am very late because the fuse holder MISSING THE FUSE AND LOOK IN THE PHOTO OF THE FUSE HOLTER THE FUSE IS IN PLACE , PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP , BETTER NOW I WANT IT NOW !"
4,I recommend this for boating enthusiasts,This is a fuse holder for a 12 volt system and is going to be used on my sailboat along with the ANL 100 amp fuses to protect my electrical system from a dead short in the starter wiring circuit as well as the other accessories.
