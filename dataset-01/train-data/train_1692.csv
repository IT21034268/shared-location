5,"The Road to Auschwitz, The road to the top!",A great book written by a Swedish psycologist(Hedi Fried) about her childhood experience in Sighet. She was in this city for a while until she was sent to Auschwitz. She was there with her sis Livi. This is a touching story for those who survived the Holocaust and even kids and grown-ups today. She reflects on how the camps worked and every where she went. They reach Sweden and Make the city of Stockholm there new home. She was separated from her sis for a while and then reunited. Hedi Fried was lost from her parents then finds out they were gased in the gas chamber. One of the greater stories I've ever read. She tells of the pain and inhumanity of the Nazis and their leader Adolf Hitler. This book leads into Schindler's List a little bit. Hedi Fried did a great job!!!
4,Non Fiction,"A useful overview of some mathematical papers and techniques for sports analysis. The editor has collected some research from some people who have looked at analysis various different sports, in one handy volume. Baseball of course is one of these when you see the front cover."
3,"Dense, assumes one is extremely familiar w/ Irish history",The author assumes his readership has significant familiarity w/ Irish history. This is not for beginners. The author does raise awareness regarding the complexity of the political landscape over the centuries and one can come away w/ a general impression. The Course of Irish History is a better overview.
5,Children's delight!,My children absolutely adore this series. They just can't get enough. I have borrowed them so much from the library (and paid so many fines) that I finally bought the set. A great addition to your child's library!
3,It is useful but...,"This text book is useful but do not expect a complete information in there. They do not provide any drafting information if you actually looking for it. Otherwise, if use for basic information, it is fine."
2,Definately not worth the price.,"I would have rather bought this book new, because it was not accurately described. ""Some"" highlighting translates to ""completely highlighted and written all over."""
1,Terrible Customer Service,I placed the order on Monday Sept 29th and today is Friday Oct 2. I am just being informed that my order cannot be shipped! There is another buyer who experienced the same thing. Books order through this seller but did not deliver. I would not buy from this seller again.
3,Good Product but only lasted 3 years!,"I purchased the Air purifier in 2008 expecting it to last as long as the other smaller Honeywell air purifiers I purchased in 2006. Unfortunately, it just stopped working a couple of months ago so I now have to spend another $250+ to replace it."
4,Great Air Purifier,"I have this in my basement as it is the room with the most dust as well as my HVAC has its primary draw from this room. This Honeywell works as advertised as long as you change the charcoal filter when the little light comes on.The only con is the spinning fan was a little off balance. So when it is on high, you can here a little bit of whom-ping sound. I called Honeywell, and they overnighted a new one. This one had the same issue, but not nearly as bad and not noticeable. I think i only heard it b/c i was looking for it.Its footprint is pretty large, so it may be an eyesore if you have it in a main room."
3,Intro Only,"""Speaking Out for Women"" is a brief easy-to-read book that introduces the reader to biblical egalitarianism. Siddons covers historical material about women in secular and Jewish culture, Jesus' relationships with women in the Gospels and the Epistles' instructions concerning women. Though the treatment of each area is brief, the author shows that Jesus' attitude of equality toward women was lived out in the early church. Siddons deals with some seeming contradictions in the epistles (such as the I Timothy passages) superficially and concludes that the church was experiencing tensions, therefore reverted to traditional cultural practices. The serious biblical student may be dissatisfied with this manner of handling these passages. The book is still a good beginning study and suitable for group use. Discussion questions are included at the end of each chapter.(This review was previously published in ""Daughters of Sarah"" May/June 1987.)"
5,Awsome song!,"I think their nonsense verses and lyrics R good and origional, and if you rally listen to the lyrics, then can make perfect sense! Maybee not Perfect perfect, but they do have meaning, and I can see that. This song is just too cool, and if u have the US version, like me theres a track ""If I cant have you"" wich is not fulla nonsense lyrics."
1,oh please,New kids on the block had a couple of hits chinese food makes me sick the meaning please this song is yuck yuck GO AWAY LFO
1,New Kids on the Block are better,"I can't say that I'm a big fan of this song. Ever since this song's introduction to the music scene, my boyfriend has been obsessed with it. He refuses to take me to Chinese food restaurants or wear anything other than Abercrombie and Fitch. Additionally, my boyfriend has racked up hundreds of dollars by text messaging the lyrics to his friend's and anyone whose number he can find. Some point out that its poignant and poetic lyrics help us to remember our tumultuous teenage years in a more positive and freespirited light. I however, am taken to a dark dark place when reminded of McCauly Culkin's repeated abandonment during the Christmas holdays. I will give it one star for giving accolades to the one and only Kevin Bacon. Who wouldn't love Tremors, Hollow Man, or Flatliners?! Although you will find originality in this song, I think the New Kids on the Block had a lot more hits than this band will ever see."
2,BUH YAH!,"At first I didn't like this song. I thought ""blah."" He likes girls for what they wear. But it grew on me. I figured out he was saying absolutely nothing in the song. They just put words together that rhyme. But the tune is good. And the lyrics are good too even though they make no sense. So be prepared to think, ""What the hell is he trying to say in this song?"" Soon enough, you'll figure out he's not saying anything at all."
1,I give it a score of ZERO,"If i could i would have given this cd 0 stars, but i guess since lfo actually had the courage to wright such a boring song, i will give them 1 star. Hehe"
5,Excellent book on gauge theory,"This work, which is not so well-known, gives a goodintroduction in gauge field theory. Starting from scalarfields quickly more advanced subjects such as magnetic monopoles, the higgs mechanism and spontaneous symmetry breaking are discussed.The work contains nice overviews of the mathematics of Lie groups and Lie algebras and has a number of useful exercises."
2,evening bag,Not typical W&D quality. The design looked like it had been badly hand-painted. I have a similar bag that is very well done.
5,creative scrapbooking,"The first part of the book explains everything the novice needs to know about design elements, digital cameras, scanners and printers. But what I really appreciated were her explanations of special effects and incorporating text with art for my scrapbooks. Her step-by-step instructions are less complicated than the help section of Photoshop Elements. This book is the perfect compliment to the PE's software."
2,Book Title & synopsis misleading,"I purchased this book thinking it would be a good primer for learning digital scrapbooking. Sadly, there are only 4 pages in the book devoted to setting up a scrapbook page & various techniques. Those 4 pages are good but not worth the purchase price. The focus of the book really is on photography and photo-editing and a lot less on scrapbooking."
1,What a DISSAPOINTMENT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I purchased this book to learn about Digital Scrapbooking not how to use PSE whatever..I was so disappointed in the book's content that I wish I could return it. If you know how to use PSE this book is almost worthless for scrapbooking. Although the title makes the book sound like a primer for digital scrapbooking nothing about the subject even kicks in until page 84 which is three quarters of the way through the book. Like i said DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!
4,Disturbing but gripping book,"I found the book to be very disturbing because of the subject matter. I usually don't read these types of books but was loaned the book by a friend. While the subject matter was disturbing, it was also a very gripping subject. When I hear stories about this subject on the news, I usually wonder how much is actually true and how much is hype. According to this book (and I believe it) there is very little hype in these reports. We need books like these to keep us aware of how much evil is in the world and that we need to protect our children."
5,Thompson's Media Review,"A gritty tale of betrayal, revenge, street justice, child victims, and flawed heroes. True to his journalistic roots, Mills gives the factual account of pedophilia in a powerful thriller that is both chilling and fascinating. A must read that shocks, thrills, and surprises.Thompson's Media Review"
5,Sheriffs 1911-1989: A History of Murders in the Wilderness of,Very interesting stories. Highly recommend.
1,Truly Horrible,"This is the Heavenly's second release and, like the first, it's a huge disappointment.As a live band these guys are a visceral, raw, scream-your-head-off band that can live with any other band around.As a studio band they seemingly have no idea. The drums sound as though they were recorded through a 30 foot steel door from six hundred miles away and the overall sound of the album suffers the same fate.Songs like Racetrack and Pretty Life (so vital in concert) are limp wristed and lard assed.How songs that sound so good when you see these people live can die such a horrific studio death is beyond me.I think THS should really think about changing producers or do something positive for the next release, because this is 12 tracks of bad news."
5,halloween fangs,"I ordered these custom designed Dracula's Fangs for a halloween party. They were easy to insert , molded to my mouth and looked real. The order came immediately and the quality was great."
3,Morrow seems to be a bit too biased,"I am in a online book club and we read this book last year. While we found it very infomative and it generated great discussions, my conclusion was Morrow seemed very biased with his writing of Kennedy. It seems Morrow was fixated on Kennedy's negatives. I would recommend this book for knowledge on these three presidents, only keep an open mind while reading it."
1,Overblown silliness,"This is truly one of the worst books ever written, a huge disappointment to anyone reading about U.S. domestic politics in the 20th century. The topic had great promise, but readers would be much better served picking up Christopher Matthews` book on Kennedy and Nixon or Robert Caro`s multi-volume biography of LBJ. Morrow`s prose is overwrought with far too much armchair psychologizing. He also has a dreadfully annoying, almost juvenile habit of using motion pictures to illustrate the points he wishes to make. It is a very unsuccessful literary device. Who at the publishers let this project see the light of day?"
1,What a Disappointment,"This book starts with a great premise -- three future Presidents at a common turning point in their lives, 1948. I bought this book thinking it was history. But I soon discovered that the occasional random historical nugget was buried among piles and piles of pretentious psychobabble, strained metaphors, obscure pop culture references, and delusions of literary grandeur. I'm not sure what's more bizarre -- the discussion of Nixon's sex life, or the pages and pages exploring the similarities between Nixon and Lana Turner.A history of these three presidents in 1948 would make a great book. Maybe someday someone will actually write it."
3,Wouldn't want to sit with Morrow at a dinner party,"As reading the other reviews shows you, Morrow's style is polarizing. His authoritative voice and pedantic vocabulary borders on pomposity in my opinion, and he has a curious obsession with not only movies but all 3 men's libido (or lack thereof). However, I can see how his bold approach appeals to some. In my mind the book compares unfavorably to Theodore White's In Search of History (White was in the middle of what he described and crafted a far more readable book.)"
1,What?,"This book is so over the top. The author appears to be obsessed with the sex lives of JFK, Lyndon Johnson and Nixon. His endless physical descriptions of Nixon, in particular, are tiring and pointless. And when he makes a surreal comparision of Nixon to Lana Turner, I thought perhaps I was drinking too much.Let me repeat this: he compares Nixon with Lana Turner.This would be like reading a biography of President Obama that compares him to Don Knotts.Perhaps if this is the kind of thing we are now down to--random psycobable--we should all declare a truce on the endless JFK, LBJ and Nixon scholarship--at least, that is, until someone can think of something new and intelligent to say."
2,"Short on history, long on wind","If you want to read about what caused ""the great degringolade of Watergate"" according to Lance Morrow, this is the book for you. If you want to actually read a fact-based history, stay away."
1,What was he thinking??!?,"I found this book very disappointing (as I gather most reviewers here did as well). In fact, I sought out reviews after reading the book for a time to see whether others shared my opinion or if perhaps I was missing something. I was not. Billed as a book about a key year in the life of three young politicians who go on to become President, it is instead a rambling, unfocused notebook which occasionally mentions the three main characters, and spends an inordinate amount of time on peripheral and sometimes completely unrelated persona of the time. This tome would have benefited from an editor who called the author to task to stay on point."
5,Monk: The Complete Series,"Being a huge MONK fan, I was really excited to get the complete series! Having watched the reruns on tv for several months, I wondered how the whole series went; when there was a change in Monk's assistant; how the show ended. Now I can watch any season I want, and have been able to get others interested in the program.Tony Shaloub is so good in this character, and the show is so funny, that I watch it to get a relief break from stress! Thank you for making the series available!"
5,Monk: The Complete Series,I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person. This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime.
5,LOVE It,"I am such a huge fan of Monk.. even though, I have it available for free on Netflix.. I had to buy this series.. Its great packaging.. and as a real fan, I could not pass this up. I only wish they would continue this series again :)"
2,Slipshod Packaging Items Missing,"Although it's great to have the entire series run in one attractive box set, the packaging seems to have been done with the same care afforded to the recent Derek and the Dominoes packaging fiasco. In my case, I purchased two of these not inexpensive sets (one for me, one as a gift) and in each situation a booklet was missing. In one set the series guide was missing and from the other set the Monk Defective Detective booklet was missing...so between the two we have one set of the offered booklets. Sent for replacements from Universal......yeah, that was a dream too...haven't received anything yet!!"
5,MONK,"Monk, what more can we say. Excellent detective work. Looking for a great deal and Amazon came through.I ordered it the first time but was lost in the system. Never received it. Finally called Amazoncustomer support to verified that it was ""lost"". Immediately had a complete Monk series shipped over nightfor free. So a 5 Star for Amazon and a 5 Star for a great series."
3,I thougth was better,"It is OK. I already had the other book of the same author, conversando en Ingles, and this one is pretty similar to me..., nevertheless it help me to practice and refresh several details of gramma and pronunciation"
4,another must,"I prefer Janis with Holding Company: wilder sound. But This one is a must as well: her best selling album, with the only # 1 hit, her last recordings, released after her death. A voice with a soul we still miss: nobody comes close to her since."
5,One helluva an album!,"This is one amazing album, from the first track to last. Every single song is bleeding with emotion, and not just from Janis, but from her band as well. All the members of Full Tilt Boogie are first class musicians. I was particularly impressed with the guitarist. His solo on ""My Baby"" is very soulful and bluesy. That's what this album is at heart: a blues album. The only thing that I would like to have heard is a longer version of ""Bobby McGee"" where the band jams for even longer. I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan The Allman Brothers, Otis Redding, and music in general!"
4,My Method by Emile Coue,"The copy of this book I have was published by the Leidecker Institute and may be a little different from the one being sold here. However, not so different as to the points the author makes. I was amazed at the simplicity in method used to implant suggestions through the subconscious. I have tried his methodology and find that changes are possible with a minimum of effort on my part. I have to say, It Works. My only reason for downgrading my rating to 4, is that I find his writing style hard to follow. And, a little disbelief that suggestion can cure, or add to the cure in so many disorders. Towards the end of the book I felt like I was being sold snake oil. But, truth be known, his method should be able to assist in resolution of all the examples given. I will keep a positive opinion and continue on."
4,FASTER FASTER!!!,"I got this as a gift at my baby shower and I thought it was great! I love how it grows with the baby. However, I feel that it should have more than 2 speeds. It goes slow and slower and my daugther gets bored really quick and starts crying. From past experiences, I feel the faster it goes the more fun it is to the child."
3,Not relaxing,"My 2 month old daughter does not really like to go in this swing and I didnt really understand why until we went to a friends house and used her swing while there. That swing reclined a bit and was much more comfortable. Upon this recognition, I went to the store and realized this swing is one of the few that does not recline. It may be better as a rocker, but I find that hard to believe. The speeds are pretty slow also. I would NOT recommend this swing to anyone."
2,So Slow,"My mom bought this swing for my daughter, and she absolutely hates the swing unless I am manually pushing it. It's very slow, not worth the money. However the removable chair alone is alright, she'll sit in that and watch t.v. or play with her toys, the rocker part of it's not that great either. I wouldn't suggest buying it to anyone, there are much better swings out there."
1,Es básico,El libro es bueno para personas que no tienen conocimiento básico del tema. Resultó ser una información repetitiva pero para el que no ha leído al respecto es muy bueno.
5,Looks great!,"This mission table is fantastic. It's inexpensive, simple to assemble, and looks great. My cleaning woman was well impressed and thought I spent conciderably more than I did. It's solid, looks greats, and does exactly what I wanted... look great while holding my phone and whatever else I choose to place on it.It's good value. I've had mine for over a year and have had no problems at all. I can easily recommend this to anyone!"
5,Much Better,For the longest time I had been using the Velcro ones that seem fairly common in pet stores.. Had to wrestle my rabbits onto their back to strap them on. It was a pain in the butt and the poor things hated it. This harness made it much easier to put on and seemed more comfortable to my rabbits. Would recommend this to anyone with small animals.
3,Not for my top shelf,"There is no doubt that the author, Maurice Hamilton, made a great effort to produce a technical book about the finer points of using Photoshop to produce black and white images. It is technical and 'dry', and a hard slog. He explains (at length) some of the detailed procedures, tips and methodology which go to making fine prints. But, the book made me think of some of the Hollywood epics where the idea is grand but the director and the editor let the cast down. I don't care for the high price-low quality production of the book, either. Not that worthy and informational books must be slick and glossy; but for me they must be attractive and 'feel' good. I will keep this book in my reference library, but I do not count it in my '20 best photography books' list!"
4,Perfectly functional,"Dartboard cases are fairly similar. This is solid oak (no pressboard garbage) and seems very sturdily made. The hinges needed some adjustment so the doors would close properly and some of the filling on the raw wood was poorly done. That being said, I shopped ALOT for a cabinet and this was much better made than what I was finding at local sporting goods/home entertainment stores. That being said, it was also cheaper than what I could find locally. So better quality an cheaper is a pretty good combination; I just bothered me that I needed to adjust hardware on the doors. This does not come with a board - as I had three lying around, that wasn't a problem.I feel like I got what I paid for - not a deal, but an appropriate value for the money."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this item. You claim solid oak but when it came the box said solid wood. It was not solid oak .if I didn't,t have to pay to send it back I sure would have. This product is crap."
4,Oak dart cabinet,"I was happy with this,it was a nice product. My only problem was the holes were too wide for my DMI board mount. I had to drill new holes. The Finish was great and the doors fit fine."
2,I Wanted to Love This,"As a bi-racial woman, I am always looking for books about the multi-racial experience in America. Unfortunately, I found this collection of stories to be long-winded, repetitive and worst of all, preachy. I wanted to love this anthology, but I just don't. Try to read at least two of the stories before you purchase."
2,Boring and mostly unimaginative,"The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity. However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems. Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest. The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating. Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again. With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts."
2,Bad content,"Good introduction. However, the content of the book is very bad. Some code doesn't work due to the syntax errors. Very frustrating when you find something from the textbook not working. THe layout is horrible."
2,Almost the same as volume 1,"I purchased both volumes and was very disappointed to realize that Vol.2 was +/-90% the SAME as Vol.1. I was able to use many of the things shown in my practices - so the DVD was not ""BAD"" - but I wish I only bought one!"
3,8 years out of date is a long time in this field,"High time for a revision, don't you think? Boost is at 1.51. C++11 is out. Or is there some other book that is up to date?"
2,disaster !!!,"metaprogramming is understandably a difficult topic. but it could have been made easier to understand with a talented writer. obviously these two authors have no such talent. organization of book is bad, there is no clear flow. concepts are often introduced without explanation, and only defined a few chapters later.in the bigger picture, this is the problem with the c++ community. the language has evolved so fast, so much into a complicated mess that only the very seasoned programmers (often young ones) can keep up the pace. in consequence, these untalented young writers bubble up as some sort of experts, and write messy books."
2,WILL THE REAL O.C. PLEASE STAND UP?,This isnt the OC I know and use to love.......very dissappointed.......get Masta Ace's Disposable Arts this should satisfy you for 2001. lata Cee
2,come on O.C. you can do better then this.,"Third album by D.I.T.C. legend O.C. tries to go far the deep bomb.This album was released 4 years after his last album.""Soul to keep"" is a nice rap tune with precise lyrics.""Dr Know"" is not to terrible it is not great but it is not that bad either.""Bounce Mission"" is actually another good standout track.""Bon Appetit"" is a street track.""Get it Dirty"" is a little bit to much party track.on ""Upmost"" he displays a tight Flow and it shows.""Respect the Drop"" is a good one also not really to bad.""Weed and Drinks"" is not the best he does show a hot Flow however.""Paradise"" has a nice beat.""Psalm 23"" ends it off okay he raps to among others Big L. This is not the greatest Hip Hop album of all time that is for sure.Inconsistent but good when it has to be good.Lyrics 7 Production 6 X Factor 4 Classic 4 Replay 5Total=5.5 out of 10 Fingers not very consistent1.Soul to keep2.Bounce Mission3.Bon Appetit4.Upmost5.Paradise"
3,Its ok,Is not his best work but still enjoyable and listenable. Get word...Life or Jewelz before this
3,MUSH WAKE UP its not that bad!,"OC one of the most gifted ""REAL"" mc's really didnt work to hard on this lp! jewelz was well the name says it it was a jewel!but this album just wasnt ditc matterial theres a fewdecent tracks a couple that stand out and other than that itsnot anything to talk about but still better than all this new rap p.diddy ludacris etc. this album would smash them but they simply arnt even mc's so im not sure if u wana pic it up if ur a ditc fan u will be dissapointed but its nothing too terrriblestill in my oppinion worth pickin up1"
1,I only gave it a star because it wouldn't allow none...,"I truly cant believe OC has continued to go downhill. I personally didn't like ""Jewelz"" that much, and was very dissapointed that something like that could come from the man who made ""Word...Life"", but this **** has to stop now. this is worse than I could ever imagine him doing. WHATEVER you do, DONT buy this album. If you have it, use it for skeet shooting. This is a poor attempt at best. I cant understand how someone so dedicated to the art can just switch up like that. This album is straight herb...."
2,"Beautiful, but not practical","I recieved 3 sets (12 place settings) as shower and wedding gifts. My husband and I just love them. They look wonderful, fit great in your hand and are heavy. The down side is that the handle chips, they make horrible scratching noises when holding them together (while gathered for setting the table, etc.), and we have hand washed them and placed them in dishwasher and they are rusting on the handle and we have only had them for 5 weeks. We exected to have them for a while and now we have to go through the hassle of exchanging them and finding a new set that we like."
1,Expectations were too high,"I bought it for my 4 yr old nephew who is a HUGE Thomas and Friends fan. What a dissapointment, he just was not interested in this DVD at all. He will sit and watch Hero of the Rails and Misty Island Rescue over and over again. Just bought Lion of Sodor for Christmas, hope that goes over better than Merry Winter Wish."
3,old Thomas,There was to much narrative by people and lost interest to my 1 1/2 year old who loves Thomas.... Wouldn't reccomend this video
1,what a dissapointment,Read my comment below...and to think I bought my child an actual christmas video...Shame on the producers for PCing their brains out...what are they so scared of?
4,Cute Winter and Holiday Thomas!!,"If your looking for a ALL CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME movie from Thomas this is not it. The movie does celebrate the ""Winter Holidays"" and included in that is Christmas. While not mentioned by name its implied, there are many holidays in winter and many children who celebrate these WINTER holidays love Thomas...why exclude any of them?! I think it was cute and my sons loved it. So if your looking for a cute holiday movie and your kids love Thomas buy it you wont be sorry and I am sure more importantly your kids wont either.I believe the one star ratings are not rating the movie or the response from there own children but there own thoughts on what has become a ""too Politically correct (pc) world"" and even if thats true it has nothing to do with this movie. Using terms like ""I aint buying it"" just shows you should not be writing a review for anything to begin with.Enjoy and Happy Holidays! ;)"
1,"If you cant mention Christmas, I aint buying it.","I find it very offensive that the producers of this can take our ""Christmas"" money but put the word ""Winter"" in its place. I love Thomas but won't be buying this one. How ironic that Thomas was created by a reverand. Stop the pc madness and giving into a very few atheists!!! The Amazon uk version actually says Christmas so I may buy that. Watch the preview and you will see what I mean."
1,An Abomination to Christianity,"Despite the author of the Thomas books being a Christian, the producers decided to attempt to sell a Christmas special without using the word Christmas once. The title should have been a red flag. The absence of the word Christmas is extremely obvious and awkward. Terms like winter star, winter decoration, winter celebration, winter tree, etc, is such a slap in the face to every Christian or person who is disgusted with companies afraid of offending muslims, Jews and other religions that do not celebrate Christmas. Most non-Christians really aren't offended by Christmas specials.I hope Christians and non-Christians alike show the makers that idiotic decisions like this reduces sales."
1,Holiday Newspeak,"I am not exactly a holy roller, but this ""holiday"" special is a new low. If you are not a Christian this special should still bother you. Our society seems to lurch towards 1984 newspeak by altering language or words that ""offend"" people. Maybe next year the writers can come up with Thomas and Friends Saturnalia special."
2,Bah.,"My kids will watch most anything Thomas - and this is no exception. The negatives for me was that this dvd has a big gold sticker on it that says ""never before seen on tv"". That's a complete lie. We have some of theses stories on our DVR from the local PBS station. No need to buy this dvd when you can watch it for free."
1,offensive,"I couldn't stand watching more than 2 minutes of this movie. It is so obvious they are trying to celebrate the religion of Atheism. Don't bother setting up a Winter Tree, or hanging Winter Lights. And wishing people a Merry Winter. It is so pathetic. You can be Atheist, but don't insult me by taking my sacred Holiday that is supposed to celebrate the Son of God's birth, and try to morph it into something generic. Christmas has already been commercialized and stolen to celebrate some fat man in a red suit. This movie is celebrating Godlessness."
3,OK,"The steam leaves sludge on your floors. The waffle covers do not pick up anything and you have to wipe up behind with another towel. I have found it works better to use a terry cloth hand towel. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought the model that has a floor attachment as well as smaller ones for all jobs."
1,You mean I can't give this zero stars?,"I own this book because I am a collector of Iron Maiden. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants the guitar tablatures.The tabs are written for a single guitar, and are not remotely accurate. While the collection of songs in this book is impressive, I would recommend any other tablature book instead of this one."
2,No solos,"If you are trying to learn the solos of the first four Iron Maiden albums (S/T, Killers, Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind), this is not the book for you. This book only has the rhythm guitar."
2,NOT WORTH IT!!,I was very unimpressed when I opened this book. Im a lead guitarist and I've played for 8 years. This has no solo arrangements and not all the riffs are tabbed. I enjoyed the interview and thats about it. I probably learned about 3-5 song but I couldnt learn the whole song cuz none of the songs are tabbed all the way through. This is not worth your money.
1,The Worst Tab Book Ever,I've played guitar for 20 years and have a lot of tab. This is probably the worst book I have ever purchased. The tab is not even close. No solos. Iron Maiden should make Hal Leonard republish this book with correct tablature. You can get better tab for these old songs on the net.
1,I agree with the majority,I bought this book when I was first starting the guitar in the mid-80s. Even then I knew it was horrible. No solos. It really does suck
2,Half-Decent,"If your looking for a basic arrangement of songs, then this book is decent. It is lacking in a majority riffs and solos. Do not expect to buy this book and get each song tabbed out entirely, or each song tabbed like it is played on the album. Its a good place to start, but overall I was unimpressed."
2,"Only for collectors, not for learning how to play the songs.","If you are looking for a complete notation of the songs, this book isn't for you. Most of the riffs and the guitar solos aren't in this book. But if you are a collector, you might want it in your library."
1,terrible tab book,"this tab book is not complete songs,with NO solos at all. do not buy this item.i sent mine back for a refund."
4,From a student of Gill...,"David Gill's books can be a bit academic. At times you really have to want it to get through the books. But if you can do it, there is great wealth to be found.I have experienced Gill as a professor and in his classes his passion emerges. He also teaches secular companies ethics, so don't pidgeon-hole him as some theologian with no relevance. He teaches secular companies ethical models that have people coming to him afterwards asking where he gets his insights from...and are surprised to find they are based on the 10 Commandments and/or The Beatitudes. So also please don't write him off as some left-leaning liberal (as another reviewer has done). He takes Biblical principles to secular places; we should all be this good.Gill is a well-rounded man with irons of philosophy (esp. Jacques Ellul), theology, ethics, and secular reasoning in the fire.He is worth a read if you have the time. I endorse him heartily."
2,"Be careful here, it sounds good but consider the source","I had the chance to meet Dr. Gill while at college in Ill. While his prose is academic, but solid, it is not the book that is in question but the source. Dr. Gill is a relativist, a liberal who supports special interest political views of the left.While the title of building moral character is an admirable one, I for one question the moral character of the author himself. Known to pursue projects with naked self promoting ambition, these personal traits defy the content of the book.Accept the content, question the author."
1,Enjoy sleeping in a swimming pool? Then buy this tent!,"This tent was a good tent in all areas except for one: leaking. Set-up and take down were simple. The airflow was excellent due to the large windows. However, it leaks terribly in the rain. Prior to going on our camping trip, I sealed the seams as directed. During a heavy two hour rainstorm, the tent leaked in four places; all of them from the seams at the bottom of the windows. Coleman claims to put all their tents through a sort of man-made hurricane test prior to selling them. This could not possibly pass that test. It's the worst tent I've ever owned and will be taking it back immediately."
3,Beware - not all replacement parts available,"We have enjoyed this tent on a number of camping trips, but one of the poles snapped and the one we need replaced is no longer available through Coleman. Leaves us having to buy a whole new tent. Not cool. Otherwise has been a great tent."
5,Grand new artists,These artists bring new life to the trio format. Their choice of materials is very refreshing. Using Juan Gabriel's compositions along with the inclusion of his participation vocally makes this CD very special.
2,pretty little coffee table book,"Its not all that useful as a travel guide, but ""the 100Greatest..."" is a fun review of some of the best holes, displayedwith some good photography.The book showcases some of the more popular and photogenic holes, but does deteriorate as the golf professionals often selected mundane looking holes simply because of their difficulty. I also was disappointed with the yardage cards of the holes. It wouldn't have ben prohibitively expensive to put in the exact yardages from all sets of tees instead of the generic ""Back Middle Front"" would it?Also, the so called ""playing tips"" are often useless blurbs completely useless to a player or were lifted from the course's own yardage book.Still, a few years from now a second edition, possibly extending to Hilton Head and adding trivia and historical information about some of the most popular courses could truly be spectacular."
3,classic???,"This album supposedly defined the era that it was released in. Unfortunately, it is still stuck in that era (unlike almost all of Sly's other classics). It does have some excellent songs, but the horrible sound quality and some songs that should have remained in the vault (""Spaced Cowboy"") keep the album, in my opinion anyway, from becoming a real classic. Sure it has hard hitting lyrics that may challenge your attitudes, but if the music isn't there to back it up then in my mind it really wouldn't be that great of an album.However, just because I don't like this album, in no way am I saying that Sly Stone is not a genius. Just check out Anthology, Stand!, or Fresh if you need confirmation of this."
4,"Not as good as ""Stand!""...but it's still pure funk and r&b m","This album was not as good as ""Stand!"" but it's still pure funk and r&b music. I like this album, it has really good songs like, ""Family Affair"", ""Luv N' Haight"", ""Poet"", and ""Time"". Those are my favorites songs. This album was good but, I still say ""Stand!"" was the best album ever made by Sly and the Family Stone."
5,"this is sly stone's ""sgt pepper"".","this is the only album i actually wore out a copy of and had to buy another. ofcoure this was during a time when albums were the thing. anyway, it sounds as good to me now as it did when it was released in 1971. to me it could have been aptly titled ""when the fun stops"". compared to ""stand"", it is a dark, brooding insight into sly and where he was at that point in his life. none the less i think it is a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. excuse me while i go turn it up.........."
4,Funky Soul!,"While not the best Sly album... this one is indeed up there. While Sly's first couple albums were more ""Hit"" oriented (with the exception of a couple tracks) this one is an all out funk jam. Right from the first track ""Luv N' Haight"" you know that Sly's gonna move you to places you've never been before. The rythmic variations between the numbers and the orchestration of some of the pieces leave you wondering what's coming next as you listen track by track. This is a must own for anyone who owns any Parliament, Funkadelic, Ohio Players etc... Sly truly is (As George Clinton would say) ""The Bomb!"""
5,Thank you for letting me see the light,"This album is good but it is the final track Thank you for letting me be myslf Africa that elevates this to the something really special. Picture the scene June 1992 a fine English summer in Oxford a million miles away from the kind of tensions that permeates the mood of this track, but bizzarely that is where this track most makes sense. Straight after listening to Fools Gold by the Stone Roses something makes me listen to this song. It is a darker and deeper funk (over 8 minutes long) which I heard. The insistent bass and stripped back drums are low key and as funky as anything with much higher production values. It really is amazing and added to this there is the truly dark lyrics which seem to be like the dark side of the original single darkly inverted. Worth buying for this song alone with the falling guitar as well. WARNING - this is better on vinyl NOT digitally remastered which cleans up the sound and takes away from the dark funk."
3,Sly And The Family Stone There's A Riot Going On,"Hey, there's a song missing here! Where is, "" There's A Riot Going On""? You'd think they could put all the songs of the album on a CD. This album is not as good as Sly's earlier ones."
2,READ THIS REVIEW TO GET THE BEST VERSION OF RIOT!!!,"As anyone with ears and eyes will tell you, don't buy the U.S. version as the sound ... and the cover art of this great album is lame in the current U.S. version. Instead, buy the European version, which has great sound and the cool original cover art (of a weird American Flag) and booklet color photos. You can get it from amazon.co.uk, the British arm of amazon.com, for a very reasonable price ($) and they will ship it to the U.S. for less [$]. (If you order other Brit-only items, you'll save on postage. May I recommend Jesus and Mary Chain's Psychocandy or Sly's Fresh?)Anyway, I ordered my copies of Riot and Fresh from amazon.co.uk and I am completely pleased with them. Give it a try!"
1,Worst CD Reissue Ever,"Yes, it is an extraordinary album -- percolating with lo-fi, hard funk rhythms, bitter, anguished vocals, and a seething undercurrent of alienation and hostility that burns holes in my speakers with every spin. Unfortunately, EPIC hasn't seen fit to grant this masterwork any dignity in its reissue. This edition has NO NOTES WHATSOEVER, no credits, no lyrics, and not even the original cover (it uses the cover of a cheesy LP reissue instead). This record deserves appreciation and context, and this reissue gives it neither. Look for the LP instead -- at least until EPIC outgrows their fear and elevates this record to the status that it deserves."
2,Not as advertised,"This item is advertised with ""Resistance controls so you can choose the intensity level of your workout"" and the picture shows three resistance bands, however these features are not on the item. There was also some parts missing and some damaged pieces. Amazon and the vendor helped me with the return. I think the chair would be very good if the advertised items were there."
4,Red Ab Chair,"After finally figuring out how to put it together (the directions were not very good) I found an old belt to use in place of the bar that should have come with it and was able to use the chair. The bar that is shown in the advertisement, the one on the top that you hold on to, did not come with the chair.I give the chair 4 stars because the chair does offer some ab resistence when you use it regularly, but only if you have something at the top to grasp. Using the handles on the side made my neck ache. If all the pieces were included it would have been 5 stars."
2,The Red Ab Chair,The Red Ab Chair is Ok. I think if you are over 200 pounds it will break. It also does hurt my back. I think it works besides that. You need to use it 2 times a day. I started out doing once a day and it did nothing for me.
3,Poor Instructions,"The instructions for this item are pretty bad. The booklet that comes with it looks like it was 1) badly Xeroxed from a bad copy and 2) translated from some other language by someone with poor English skills or an online translator. The pictures are supposed to help you assemble the chair but they're so small and the resolution is SO bad that it is impossible to read them. Before you buy, try to find good images online and PRINT THEM ON A DECENT PRINTER. That may help.The instructions aside, the chair is what it is. It is a good work out as long as you realize that you'll need to do about 3 - 4 times more crunches in the chair than on the floor to have the same impact. It is good as a low impact workout - especially for those with a bad back. The chair is sturdy and folds up small enough to put under a bed or tuck in the corner and out of the way."
1,I kept the batteries and threw the flashlight away,"This has to be one of the worst flashlights I have ever owned. It now lays in the trash basket. The LEDs must have been hand-picked for emitting as little light as possible. Even with all 5 LEDS on, you get less light than a old-style filament single-bulb flashlight. To turn the flashlight off, you must click the on-off switch five times (3 white LEDs, white 5 LEDs, white LEDs off and three red LEDS on, three LEDs flashing (very dimly), off). Since the red LEDs are in the base of the flashlight, you need to check to make sure the flashlight is truly off. Seriously, avoid this one. There are hundreds of flashlights for sale on Amazon and there is zero reason to get this one. Maybe if it was $2 it would be worth it. Maybe."
3,try something else,"use the book for 5 months to prepare a test. one of worse book I have ever read, the book was wrote in such style like this sentence from page 176:""This restricted recognition may sometimes be caused by differences in the conformation of the bound peptide imposed by the different MHC molecules rather than by direct recognition of polymorphic amino acids in the MHC molecule itself.""what is the author tried to say?"
2,"I must be an idiot, because...","... a lot of people are saying this is a good ""starter book"" or it's very basic- HOWEVER - I find the sentences to be very lengthy and written in a manner that is hard to understand. I am not a med student, but I did complete my BS in bio not more than 5 years ago. This book is a hard read for me- perhaps I need more review in molecular bio."
4,"accessible, comprehensive","Full of illustrations and has interactive content which is somewhat useful. The pictures or cartoons are not as attractive or memorable as other texts. The side bars have a number of useful, easy to learn facts. This book seems caught between wanting to be read, and wanting to be comprehensive. It falls short of both a bit, but is one of the best choices around for subject matter."
4,Driving Bluegrass,"Be careful the first song on this CD ""1952 Vincent Black Lightning"" will having you searching eBay for an old motorcycle!Del and the Boys is a good introduction to this driving Bluegrass band. Some have commented that his voice is not for them, but its a classic high lonesome sound.The lyrics on this particular album are one of the things that keep bringing me back to it. While I live in the heart of ""Bluegrass Country"", I know what it means to miss Kentucky. While ""All Aboard"" helps me to remember that the what lies ahead is better than where I've been and that someone is listening to my prayers.If you ever pass me on the street with my windows down, odds are you will hear this CD playing."
2,Del and the boys do it again,"As always Del, and the boys are up to their usual high standards of picking and singing. I love the mix of Del's soulful singing, and the Mccoury bands heavy Blues influence in their music. They also have picked out some different material. Isn't there a Sinatra song in there? If I was introducing someone who was new to Bluegrass music, I could never recomend Del Mccoury as their first cd purchase.(only because that high lonesome sound has to grow on you) If you like new material done in a traditional way...then I would highly recommend this cd."
5,Del and the Boys - Del McCoury,"What a wonderful, surprising, toe tapping CD.. I was considered to be a babe in the woods whenever it came to Bluegrass music that is until Del and the Boys came into my life. I was on my way home from work whenever I heard an interview with Mr.McCoury on my Public Library Station here in Nashville and the rest is history. Being a true Southern woman at heart I have a mind to set my cap for both Del and his boys! GREAT CD!!"
4,A sensitive policeperson.,"This is the first Inspector Banks novel, or indeed the first Peter Robinson novel that I have read. I found the plot engrossing, the characters well drawn. Inspector Banks is almost too good to be true, his handling of suspects is sensitive and compassionate. His relationships with his co-workers and family are well portrayed. I loved the musical refferences, in fact I will be looking for several of the pieces mentioned, especially the Vivaldi, you will have to read the book to see what I mean by this. I had figured out ""who dun it"" before the climax of the book, but that did not detract from my enjoyment. I will be looking for more books by Peter Robinson."
4,Intense and complex.,"The Inspector Banks mysteries just get better over time and this one is particularly good. An intense, character-driven mystery it is also laced with danger. The complex realtionships between the suspects, the police, and the victim make for gripping reading."
3,Plodding through the slush,"Chilling portrayal of Yorkshire winter weather. I shivered throughout, from the meteorological descriptions, not the plot. This is an OK British dullsville police procedural of the Greeneland lite school, with a who-cares plot and at least 100 pages of padding. The one who dun it stood out like a sore thumb at first introduction. I give it three instead of two stars because it is literate and the dialogue works. Some interesting asides on twentieth century classical music. I find it difficult to believe that British police can get away with so much drinking on the job. But maybe they can. Maybe that's why it takes them those extra 100 pages to see what's in front of their nose."
3,A bad day of skiing,"Peter Robinson seems to be one of those unusual authors who improves with experience. While all of his books are enjoyable, Past Reason Hated is one of his early weaker productions. Inspector Banks is his likeable self and it's always a pleasure to read about him. Robinson's details about life in Yorkshire and London are also illuminating. But Past Reason starts strong only to run out of steam in the second half. Still worth reading in the same way that a bad day of skiing is better than a good day at work!"
3,abridged or not?,just purchased an audio CD of this book and found it to be just 3 hours long! Then I saw it was abridged. I typically do not buy abridged books but saw nothing on the product details that said it was cut. Caveat emptor! Wouldn't it be best if the seller had to note that the book was either unabridged or not?
5,The Best 2D Fighting Game Ever!!,In a Nutshell Street Fighter Alpha is the BEST 2d Fighting Game ever created bar none!!!outstanding game play and crisp Graphics are the trade mark of Alpha 3 there is no other 2D Game out there like it!!!if you like fighting games like I do then you MUST have Alpha 3 in your gaming library!!!
2,gf,harble grahpics what is wiyh that game it worth then grahpics in 3ds is 10 better then the one for psp
5,needs the fighting stick,Great game needs fighting stick and big memory card other than that its awsome online play full custom clothes and much much more
2,"Inappropriate ""Kid's Story""",I thought this was going to be a cute story for me to give to my 5-year-old granddaughter. I'm glad I read it first! I was so surprised to see that it was about a thief .. not much at all about a man who wore all his clothes -- that was more of a sideline. Big disappointment! Of course my granddaughter will never see this book.
4,OUTSTANDING CINEMATOGRAPHY- KEPT MY ATTENTION,"This movie was sooooo cool! I just watched it about an hour ago and I had to run upstairs to my computer to see if it was available online. The cinematography was great--to be able to make a movie that takes place 99% at night AND MAKE IT WORK! this is a feat in itself. The characters were believable enough, although I had a slight problem with how stereotypical they seemed--black blues jock, yuppie materialistic sister from uptown Chicago, truck stop employees ect.. The soundtrack was one of the best features of the movie along with the cinematography.I would like to see it available in some form--even 8 track tape! Overall, very watchable and fun--worth the money."
3,Rocket Gang Forever.,"If you're a Roketto Dan fan, you need this CD. It is the fourth Poketto Monsutaa CD released. Or if you just love Poketto Monsutaa, buy this.The first song is by Musashi, Kojiro and Nyaasu singing about how their is an evil in the world and they will show everyone the light. Just shows how far off 4 Kids were with their version!The second song is by Kojiro singing about how he meets a girl at a club (or is it at a Krab??) and what happens afterward.The third song is ""Nyaasu no Uta"". It's about how somewhere in the world, there is a companion for Nyaasu, or as he puts it; ""another me"". A very sweet song.In conclusion, buy this CD. You won't regret it!"
5,Such a good movie...,All young women should watch this film. All middle aged and older women should watch this film.The filmmakers do a great job of interviewing the attendees and teachers of this camp; interspersed are amazing statistics about how girls and women perceive themselves. This film is really well organized and super entertaining.Watch the special features for extra interviews and performances.
4,Frango Memories,"Yes, the first thing I thought of when I saw that Marshall Fields had Frangos (!) was Seattle - where my mother-in-law introduced me to Frangos at Frederick & Nelson department store in downtown Seattle over 30 years ago! I'm sure Marshall Field's version comes close, but there's nothing like the original."
5,Chicago's Best Chocolate,"As a chocolate lover, I can definitely say that this is the best chocolate in the Chicago! I would even go as far as to say I think it is the best chocolate in the world. Well worth the wait for the package to come in the mail! I went to the website and found the recipe for Frango Chocolate chip cookies and made the most delicious cookies. In the recipe or alone, these chocolates are a treat anytime!"
2,not so great,"I hate to say this, because I was looking forward to trying out the Frangos, but I was not overly impressed with these mints, they left my mouth with a waxy aftertaste. Do yourself a favor, save the $17 a lb and purchase instead a box of Russell Stover mint patties at your supermarket, $6.00 for a 9 oz box. Or even better, get the Lindt mint truffle bag, they are the best, and cost also in the same price range, I think about $7.00 for an 8 oz bag!"
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I would not recommend buying this product. The chocolates are delicious, but I ordered this and had it sent as a gift. When it arrived, it had all melted into one giant chocolate mess. So, while the chocolates taste fine, they apparently can't be sent and kept in a good condition."
4,a dieters best friend,"I received this book for my birthday along with this amazing new beverage as an alternative to coffee. Made from 100% soy that's organic, its absolutely delicious! It's caffeine-free and comes in 8 delicious flavors. Just google it under ""s oyfee"" to find it and you won't be disappointed."
1,Where's the fountain?,"I got charged for the fountain weeks ago, but never got a fountain. I contacted the seller, but never heard back!"
5,Time Travel at it's best!,"One of the best books I've read...ever! A friend had given it to me- I didn't think I'd like it but was pleasantly surprised. It's also one of the only books I've kept since I've had it and have re-read it twice which I NEVER do as there are too many great books out there left to be read. I thought the story quite believable and totally entertaining - it would make a great movie, read it and enjoy!"
4,A Time-Travel Romance with Some Bite,"Renata O'Neal is an accountant engaged to a man she doesn't love. Her life is stagnant and she feels there should be more. Her fiancee is pushing her towards marriage and buying a home. He also puts his mother's wishes before Renata's and that causes problems.Renata starts to see hallucinations and visits a doctor who hypnotises her. It takes her on a journey to the late 1800's where she takes over Callie Blue's life. A time-travel romance with a little more bite, REFLECTIONS IN TIME deals with rape and how it affects women during that era.Elizabeth Crane's romance has some problems but, because the plot is somewhat different, it kept me intrigued. If you enjoy romances that contain a unconventional element look for this story. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
5,very motivating and inspirational,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It really helps to look at an average daily walk in a new way and made me excited about a walk i took over and over. i would recommend this book to anyone that liked walking and exploring new ways of doing it!
4,Walking enlightenment,Mindwalks gets you out on your path with mindful approaches to walking that help keep you motivated.
3,"Please, for all our sakes, someone get this man an editor.","It's ironic that this book bested E.L. Doctorow's favored ""The March"" for this year's National Book Award. Both tackle the massive complexities of war from both sides of the conflict. Doctorow's work is a spare and riveting read, but could have been really great with a more expansive treatment. In turn, Vollmann created a great work but buried it under excessive prose and plot. In particular, the sections on Shostakovich were over-done, over-long and overboard, especially when it came to his obsession with his erstwhile mistress, Elena. I would have liked to hear a little more of her thoughts and much less of his. This is undeniably an important and meticulously researched work that could have benefited immeasurably from a more diligent editor. As it is I gave it 3 stars for its ambition and scholorship. If I were rating it for its entertainment value, then it only would have deserved 2 stars."
4,Worth the Effort,"When I made this bulky tome my next reading effort, the first 15 or so pages were so surrealistic and incomprehensible to me, it went back on the 'to be read' pile. After reading several favorable reviews here, I felt I should give the novel another chance and am glad I did. As I progressed, my mind seemed to gain traction with Vollman's writing style, despite the often non-linear story lines and sudden point of view switches. I think it helped that I'm a great admirer of Shostakovich and his work(and he is the central character here), and I'm well versed in the history of the Soviet Union. Sections on Vlasov, Paulus, and Gerstein are heart wrenching and I'm certain some scenes and turns of phrase will stay with me quite awhile."
2,another thousand pages just got off of the train,"it is easy to read this book (unlike others by the author), but difficult to fathom why it was written, what it is in aid of, the plot, the characters, all looking for... what? who exactly is narrating it? there is an ""I"" but damned if he makes constant and coherent sense, symbolically (and there is a bit too much of this) or otherwise. there is so much ""research"" underpinning every sentence (voluminous notes to credit every burp) that no one or no action quite comes alive, everything buried beneath the author's attempt to appear ""learned,"" I guess. these are not real people one cares about in the least, even as they walk into gas chambers (again footnoted beyond belief). i have trouble understanding how this author manages year after year to turn out such long volumes. no writer can write so much and produce it so fast and have it be all that good. perhaps he should take more time on the next one."
2,Literary Ambien with delusions of Dostoyevsky,The book certainly had occasional interesting points. The author does know his history. The story could have been told in 400 pages.
2,Son of Dos Passos?,"My first experience of William T. I found the novel too reminiscent in technique of EL Doctorow's RAGTIME - the constant kaleidoscopic cutting between different sensibilities, interspersed with undisguised authorial commentary and narrative. It works, but not as well - but then nor does Doctorow - as it did in their common parent, John Dos Passos. Read his shorter (than his great trilogy, USA) novel, MANHATTAN TRANSFER to see the technique exploited to give a very real sense of an entire society at a moment in time.The writing itself in EUROPE CENTRAL, dealing with a 'foreign' culture and age, is often too literal to really enthuse and affect and the background research seems 'dragged in', while the sense of the novel's overall design makes itself felt too evidently.I will try more, but this is not the novel with which to begin the study of William T. Vollman."
2,Nonsense,"Thinking I was going to read some smart literature, I went out and bought a stack of Vollmann's books. Imagine my surpise when I tried to read this stuff. It is nonsensical and boring. I guess I'm one of those people not smart enough to understand today's literary fiction, but the first paragraph of this book is incomprehensible. I have packed up the stack of Vollmanns for the library and am going back to my classics, and let some other poor fool attempt these bricks. I'm going to finish ""Don Quixote,"" move on to some Melville, and read some Faulkner."
3,"OK, but you can do better.","This performance does convey some of the serene beauty, but little of the excitement, of Prokofiev's score. Ashkenazy on Decca, which includes Glazunov's The Seasons, a wonderfull work for its own part, is more dramatic and better recorded.There are several recordings of the 'highlights' but I'm not aware of many other recordings of the entire work. There is probably a Soviet era recording or two, although past experience with those suggests a trade-off in orchstral polish and recording quality vs. visceral excitement."
5,Civic Virtues: Both Comprehensive and Entertaining,"As a former Political Science student, I can attest that Dagger's book on Civic Virtues is one of the most comprehensive and entertaining political science books on the market today."
3,Not for laymen,"This book is less a thought provoking manuscript on social change than the authors attempt to justify basic precepts that are already commonly accepted (if uncommonly practiced). While the book is good, its intended audience is not for those with a passing interest in social awareness, it is a treatise aimed at other social scientists. I found many basic tenents explained in ways I personally have never considered them, however overall I found it hard to extract the content from the explanations that seemed over-inflated. Necessary perhaps as an argument but not as education."
5,A Glimpse of Shepard's Genius,"The Pooh Sketch Book is a wonderful look at the creative genius of Ernest H. Shepard. This collection of preliminary sketches for the classic Pooh illustrations is a must for any serious patron of illustration. Shepard's economy of line and his mastery of gesture and movement are even more evident in pencil form. The softness of the medium coupled with the charm of the subject is a perfect combination. Even though Shepard is a well known and well loved illustrator, this book gives you a new appreciation for the artist. The book is well produced and the illustrations are handled well. One does not often find a collection of studies for finished illustrations, and when one becomes available it offers the reader a rare chance to see the masters mind at work. I simply can not say enough about Ernest H. Shepard, and this amazing collection of drawings."
5,Sad but necessary.,"This is one of those books that should never have had to be written. Sadly, the need is there, and Nugnet undertakes the task with compassion and resourcefulness. This is an excellent resource book for physicians, school counselors, pastors, and others to whom a pregnant woman might turn for help when she is being pressured to abort."
2,Not for iphone or driod,"The ear buds work fine and volume control works, but the mic does not work on my droid or my iphone."
2,"Pass, get different ones",It wasn't worth the money. i found that if you really are going to invest in earphones then spend a little more and get quality ones. you do get what you pay for.
1,Ipod ear bud,I am not tech savy- I needed replacement ear buds for my Ipod- I ordered the following ear buds but was unaware the jack was not compatible with my Ipod- I only have one female access- the price was great but I ended up with something I can not use. Postage is more than what I paid for the buds- live and learn.
5,Really good sound quality,"2 things... It comes with 2 different size jacks. If you only use the 3.5mm, cut the smaller one off. Second, the cords are extremely long, like... WOW kinda long. Other then that, they hold to the ear really well and aren't uncomfortable. The sound quality is surprisingly great, handles anything from rap to rock, amazing in movies and video chatting. The bass is really low and clean."
2,Okay,Wire is too long and of not of good quality. its hard and double plug always giving me trouble when I wanted to connect to only one device. Also mic is very bad and opposite person always have complain that they cant listen to me.
3,Great Toy,My son has some visual impairment and enjoys the lights and vibrations. I've purchased 2 so far from different sellers. The first purchase was still in it's original packaging and worked fine until my son dropped it on the floor and broke it. Our most recent item from this seller was shipped w/o the original packaging and wrapped in bubble wrap. It was also defective. The batteries were not connecting to the contacts so I had to create a mechanism to make them connect.Overall it is still a great toy.
3,Broken,My son broke this toy in less than 24 hours and wasn't even rough with it. Until then it was his favorite Christmas present so I'm super sad it died
1,Infant visual tracking,This is a cheap knockoff of the original Metear Storm. It is a POS. Do you have a source for the original?
2,Would be great if more durable,"Our daughters...age 4years old and 8months old, love this toy. However we are very disappointed that it breaks so easily. It would be a great toy if it were more durable. I wouldn't waste your money on this."
3,Not very happy,"I got shipped the wrong toy, it is built poorly, and I would also love to know if there is lead in it as I have two young children ages 2 yrs old and 7 months old. This toy looks very old like an antique and smelt when we opened it up. I absolutly hate it and dont think it is worth what we paid for it. If it wasnt to much of a hastle to return items, it would deffinatley be going back."
3,"Originally published as ""Ironfire""","Another reviewer included this info in their review, but I thought I'd just reiterate that ""The Sword and the Scimitar"" is the same book that was originally published as ""Ironfire"", which I discovered after I'd bought it for my husband as a Christmas present. I read and loved Ironfire, so I bought another book by the same author without looking too closely at the description. Just wanted to let everyone out there know so nobody ends up looking foolish like I did. Great book, though!"
3,Romance & Seige,The first 2/3 of this book is an enjoyable historical romance. Dreadful things are happening all around but I came to expect that the author would not let any of the terrible things happen to his hero & heroine - a Maltese sister & brother - Maria & Nico. I settled back and enjoyed learning about Malta and Istanbul and the Ottomans and the Knights. But then the dreadful siege of Malta started and everything went to hell. People we care about are killed or worse. Everyone suffers dreadfully for the longest time. When Maria & Nico are finally rejoined it is in circumstances so terrible as to be almost indescribable. The author's writing skills are also not up to the complexity of the siege so the book gets boring. The quick wrap-up at the end of this long book is not satisfying.I really did enjoy the first part and I learned a good bit. But I sort of wish I'd stopped reading when the siege began.
4,Pokemon Can Draw Pictures!,I was able to purchase this CD at a local Chinatown and I couldn't wait to listen to it since I was a Pokemon fan. The songs where pretty good (even though I couldn't understand the words) and I also liked the beats.
4,Creation Science 101 is what it is,"I found this book to be interesting and informative. I really think the author's directed this toward a younger reader. There are several attempts at humor that I found to be a bit distracting along with serious study. I do applaud them for laying out the creation argument in a step by step easy to understand format. It is a good starting place for those who want to understand how science and the Bible, if not in concert, are not at odds in the evidence of beginning of all that is. I recommend it to anyone who wants to start down a path with an open mind about God and the Big Bang therory."
2,The score on the score,"Like James Ashby, I was looking forward to the great music played by the legends of jazz throughout the film. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. I should have read the CD closer, but once I popped it in the player I was disappointed to find that what was actually there was the score, which while entertaining, is somewhat repetitious. I doubt that I will play it again, and it's too bad the production company didn't think to capitalize on all the great music they incorporated into the film. Particularly Diana Krall's closing song. If you're buying the CD for the music heard behind the scenes in the film ie. Cassandra Wilson, Mose Allison, Diana Krall don't bother because it's not there."
3,The Diana Krall Music Is Missing!,"I would have bought this CD in an instant if it had included the last song on the film, entitled: ""I'll Make It Up As I Go,"" by Diana Krall. (I'm sure more than a few people agree that was a great song.) It's not on any of her previous work. The only hope is that she included it on her new CD, out Sept. 18th, as a bonus track."
3,Where is the music?,"In the film, the sound track on the CD was heard in the faint background, but the film was filled with good jazz, Diana Krall vocals and the like. Where did they go?"
1,Disappointed,"I'm a big fan of Diana Krall. I like the movie and all the songs in the movie, especially the one by Diana at the end. I was actually thinking of buying the CD but since it is not on the soundtrack, I have since changed my mind. Too bad !"
3,Very disappointing....what gives???,"Ive seen 'The Score numerous times, and can't for the life of me find that haunting song at the end of the picture and beginning of the credits by Diana Krall. Please tell me where I may purchase it...I would like to find the name of the album its' on. I love Diana, she is fresh, creative and sings with feeling..and to think of De Niro while I'm listening to it, is more than I can stand..HELP!"
2,Very disappointed,"Like the other reviewers, I was extremely disappointed to discover that the great jazz vocals in the film are not on the soundtrack CD. After looking at the song list, I decided not to purchase the CD. The score is good, but it is repetitious and can't make up for the lack of the vocalists. The production company/director really dropped the ball on this soundtrack."
4,"ok, would like to sell it bak.","this cd. is not the one i was looking for, but it is in good condition. i was opinionating on the contents, the music, itself. not within my interests.Service was fine."
1,Where's Krall??,"Like many others, I purchased the soundtrack to hear Diana Krall, but without checking the track list. Dumb! None of the tracks on this CD are one's that I'd just sit down & listen to. They're all setting a mood for the scene. You know - like background movie ""music."" Don't buy this CD unless you're more interested in the composer's art than the songs you enjoyed while watching the movie. Should've read the reviews first. Dumb again! Ouch!!"
1,Where is the Diana Krall song??,"Like other reviewers, I've been looking for the Diana Krall song. How is it that they have all this great jazz music in the movie and not put it on the soundtrack?"
1,Why Not Diana?,"I like several other reviewers am dissapointed that the Diana Krall song ""I'll Make It Up As I Go"" is not included on this CD. What an omission, what a great mistake!"
5,Great Book!,This is an excellent book on perspective I would HIGHLY recommend it to any art student!
5,Great Telescope!,Easy to assemble and really fun to use! Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and we had the whole family out sky watching the first night...was very easy to see Jupiter and its bands on night # 1. The software is good once you get used to it and really helps you identify objects in your area. I live in the perfect place for it...the desert...so no city lights and very little local lights to mess with it. My recommendation to anyone buying- zero your view finder...what a difference that makes. Initially I was just fumbling around looking for objects and that is literally like looking for a needle in a haystack.
5,Great Telescope,"Easy to setup, easy to use, better than expected viewing capabilities, and a great value for the purchase price. Being new to telescopes we read a lot of reviews prior to making our purchase. The Orion 4.5 Classics ranked very high every where we looked which helped us make our purchase decision. After owning it now for a couple months I can say we agree that it is indeed a easy to use model with wonderful viewing capabilities."
4,Great Telescope,"I've had this telescope for about 6 months now and like many other reviews it's a fantastic piece. Assembly can be a bit tricky with the instructions given, however, it goes togehter in no time. The item shipped and arrived in perfect condition, which is something that I worried about, especially when shipping a telescope.If you want to gaze at the moon, this telescope will allow you to see incredible details. Craters, valleys, etc. The spotter scope on top does a decent job, but is a little inaccurate. Turned the scope to Juipter, and it's true you can see the cloud rings, however it's not that powerful. Saturn is the same way, you can see the rings, but no detail to speak of.Overall this is a great scope, very portable, and easy to use. Great purschase!"
4,Great scope for the money,"After doing some research I came to this great little Dobsonian Telescope and pulled the trigger. My four year old son had been showing an interest in the Moon and stars so I thought this would be a nice gift for Christmas. It's wonderful quality for the money so even if he didnt like it (he does!) it can be used for years to come.We've had many people comment on the look of it. It really makes it's presence known and yet it's small enough to be very portable and take up a small corner of the room. Perfect height for my son to look through as well.Easy to set up, and great views of the moon! I'm anxious to take it outside on a nice clear night now that the weather is warming up."
4,"Despite the cons, I would recommend!","PROS:- It is a Citizen!- 5 year warranty- very nice looking- eco-drive system: never needs batteries- complete world time (DST per zone, etc).CONS:- no light (but that is due to the eco-drive)- no hourly alarm- for me, its is difficult to pull out the crown without loosening the bracelet- very easy to scratch (and they say the titanium version is even more soft!)For an average male wrist, it is not too big nor too heavy."
3,flaw,I received this watch with a little flaw.The dial has a nick in it.Just a small flaw.I don't hope come again.
4,Guy Gadget,"I happened to be a lucky worker that got this watch for 5yrs service. Being a watch-geek, I was very happy to receive a $400 for FREE. I received it in the mail today and read through the booklet. The cd was more helpful as it gives you play by play settings and audio/video. It only took me about 20 minutes to setup for use.Pros: Solid watch, stainless band, world time zones, countdown timer, 3 alarms, stop watch, military time, date, never needs a battery.Cons: The bezel has numbers for calculations but it's almost impossible to see/read and there's no back light. Maybe I'm spoiled with my casio.. lol."
2,Not original flavor as advertised,"I recently visited a Cracker Barrel and bought a box or Dubble Bubble Original Flavor bubble gum. I remember chewing this gum as a kid, it was my favorite gum because of its great flavor. After I had a taste for the gum again, I wanted more and I am 100 miles away from the nearest Cracker Barrel, so I checked on Amazon, my go to place. I was excited to see they had it and two separate listings. One for ""original"" and a regular flavor. The tub that I received is not the original flavor bubble gum, even though it specifically states that it is on the product listing. This is the plain, old, gross, generic flavor they changed to a couple of years ago.If you are looking for the cinnamon/clove flavor you remember growing up, this is NOT the gum you are looking for, you will be disappointed."
2,This is not the Fleer Dubble Bubble of old,"I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid ""barrel"" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, ""America's Original"". Well the name is the same but the product is completely different."
2,Not much flavor,I ordered this gum and was shocked at how big a bucket of 380 pieces is. Its a lot of gum which is good. The flavor tastes great for a couple of minutes but I noticed that the flavor is gone in just a few minutes. I would not reorder this because after about 3 minutes it just tastes rubbery. All the flavor is gone. This was disappointing to me. I don't recall how long the original lasted but this just does not last long enough for me to recommend it.
2,Very Very Slow,You have got to be kidding me! Over three weeks to get a tub of bubble gum shipped to Pennsylvania. Next time I will order from Belgium. Then I might get the product prior to Christmas.
1,Buyer Beware!!!,This gum and its very pink color ended up costing me $549.00 In dental work. It turned the front tooth pink and the dentist worked on it for 2 hours first getting the pink out of the tooth then working on the material that he had to use to fill the tooth back in to return it to it's orginal color. The was no cavity and brushing was done. Just be careful unless you don't mind the dental bill.
4,Just what we needed,"This turned out to be a big hit on Halloween, with some kids even asking for more! Love the tub, and the gum would have received five stars except for the aroma. Whoa - I'm sure I loved it as a kid but the super sweet odor nearly drove me batty! But I'll be ordering again for next year, for sure - I'll just keep a clothespin handy!"
4,don't know why,"I love my dubble bubble. So I guess it isn't a surprise that I wonder why this product looks like it was pushed through a pasta maker when the ""real"" gum I love is smooth as a cylinder. Not sure why this one is serrated."
2,Latent Power of the Soul,"Strong area is the explanation of the difference between spirit, soul and body. Weakness is the introduction of psychology into the discussion which seemed dated."
2,Not for me,You would have to form your own opinions of Watchman Nee's ponits of view. I was interested in furthering my knowledge of Watchman Nee when I read this book.
5,Watchman Nee,"I was recently @ Barnes and Nobles and walking through the Christian section, somewhat dissatisfied by the selection; I was searching for spiritual meat. This small book by Watchman Nee, whom I had never heard of, was facing foward with a beautiful flower on the cover and it immediately caught my eye. I read much of it at the bookstore, but I had to buy it and finish the whole book. I have now read A Spiritual Man and I am walking in the Spirit like never before. Thank you Jesus. He always gives us what we need, when we need it. This book will change your walk."
4,strange hollies cd,the hit long cool woman in a black dress doesn't really fit here .the other songs are sort of dark for the hollies.its sort of a transition cd from the stuff they were doing in the sixties. alan clarke left soon after its completion i can understand why.not a really hollies sort of record.
4,Better for the graphics than for the coloring,"If you're looking for a great coloring book, this isn't the best choice since the detailed drawings are rather hard to color. But if you have a need for great pictures of castles to use in publications, this books is for you. There are 31 black-and-white illustrations with 15 two page spreads, including the centerfold which details all the parts of a circa 1200 Norman castle. All four cover pages have color pictures.Each picture is of an actual castle and the captions on each page give a little information about the castle including when it was constructed. Castles from England, France, Italy, Spain, Portual, Germany, and Japan are included."
4,"Happy, upbeat music","Georgie Porgie will always make you feel good. Some of the Christian overtones are a little nauseating, but they are super-subtle."
4,Great book for intermediate ESL students,"I found that this book is very useful. It did improve my business English a lot. But, I hope there would be more examples in the book for practice."
4,A lot of idoms,"I bought this book because I hope to improve my English in business setting. The book is a good buy because it contains variety of business situations which prepares me with words and phrases. It summarizes lots of idioms which are also useful. However, while reading the book, I feel it is difficult to learn. Every sentence is full of idioms, which makes me too tired to read. I finally gave up reading in three days."
1,Couldn't Install The Game Either,"My first attempt to install this game was unsuccessful. It appears that one of the CD's was missing critical installation files. I exchanged the game for a second copy, but this time discs were missing from the box. There are supposed to be 6 CDs, but my box didn't have them. A third attempt produced the same result. I have given up!"
3,Might be worth a shot,"If you're worried about the StarForce copy protection (and you should be) you should know you can now buy this game via Steam -- without the nefarious StarForce drivers being surreptiously installed on your machine.As for the game itself, it feels like kind of a cross between a game like Freelancer (mission-based combat with lots of opportunity for trading-runs for profit) and a classic ""build an empire""-type game.The controls and UI do leave a bit to be desired (a common flaw in European games if you ask me) but they're workable.If you like the space genre, and the idea of owning space factories that produce goods just for you, this game is probably worth a shot."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This game is a definite step backwards from X2.Not only does it suffer from an interface that was simultaniously developed for pc and console(meaning the pc version was""dumbed down"")but it installs the most insidious version of StarForce.I had to reformat my computer after installing this load of garbage.Don't ever mention this problem on the official forums or you will have the moderators accusing you of being a pirate.The plot bites(what little I could play because of bugs and copy protection problems)combat is really boring and easy.Iwish I could give this misbegotten bundle of bad coding no stars."
1,That was the Doctor?,"Its been a while since I read this book and I had forgotten all about it until I stumbled upon it here looking for other Doctor Who books. I was surprised to see it rated so highly by two others. Why, because the book was not a Doctor Who story. One review mentions that the Doctor wasn't featured prominently ... that he was just another character. I don't have a problem with that. However, by the time I finished the book, I felt I had just read a (uninteresting) story that had the Doctor Who name and some of the character names from Doctor Who applied to the book. Not once did I feel that any of the characters that were supposed to be tied to Doctor Who were. At best, they were some distorted alternate universe version of the characters, where, as I reacll, the Doctor wasn't a time lord.The book just didn't do much for me in terms of being a Doctor Who story. If you can get past it not being a Doctor Who story at all, you may actually like it."
3,"This is a Fair book, but not great.","Like the title says, this is a fair book, but not great. It is worth reading however, and I felt like I got my money's worth."
5,Storytelling at its best!,"Jeff Janoda proves himself to be a master storyteller as he brings tenth-century Iceland brilliantly to life. SAGA is a powerful and absorbing read, rich and authentic in detail, sharply insightful, and brimming with finely rendered characters whose lives are intricately bound through the ties of loyalty, kinship, duty, and above all, the Law. Janoda deftly handles the complexities and harsh realities of life in the early Free State, peeling away layers of motives and shrewd cunning that drives men's actions -- be it born of wisdom, high ideals, and ethical strength; greed and a lust for power and land that leads to treachery, betrayal, and bloodshed; or a more basic need to appease the gods and dark spirits that haunt the land and even, at times, the restless wanderings of the dead. This is storytelling at its best. In short SAGA is superb!"
2,satasifaction,"It's an old cartridge game of course it will work and give you satisfaction, old school style."
3,Take That Ted Turner!,"In what was surely a misguided attempt to mock their boss's penchant for colorizing classic movies, the gentle subversives at DC comics did the reverse with Jack Kirby's classic 4th World books. Politically it was a bold statement, but it doesn't serve Kirby's work well. I respect 'em for taking such a bold stance and whatnot. I just wish they had done it to Englehart's run on Batman or something boring like that."
2,silly junk,"Costumed morons with superpowers fighting against each other page after page is what you will find in this ineptly drawn and written comic ""classic"". It's strictly kid stuff."
2,Color on the outside black & white on the inside,I love Jack Kirby's art and the work he did on the New Gods is some of the very best in comic book history. However a lot of the effect is lost with no color. I have read comic books for more then 40 years and I feel a little cheated when a comic that was originally in color is reprinted in black & white. How cute of DC to put a color cover and have no information on the cover for the buyer to know the inside is black & white. False advertising on DC's part. I do not blame Amazon.
4,One of the sources of Star Wars,"Star wars had many sources, this was one of them. That Kirby was a source of Star Wars is fairly well known. I do not know whether Lucus admited this, but he seemed to go out of his way to leave all sorts of clues. It is fun to look through this work to pick out the things that show up in Star Wars."
3,its cool,"i like things about this show and of course the similaritys between it and Entourage are there and they share a producer and a certain feel, difference between the two is that How to Make it in America doesn't have a Arie that you either love or hate type character to balance things out. you have a good hustle of action and things happening in this showm but nobody ever overshadows or takes it beyond what is presented. it is a very well placed cast, however its a cool show which works well in its lane."
4,Good book / Great supplement,"I used this book as a supplement for math590(ind.study) on simplicial homology groups. This book is good because its cheap, concise, and rigorous (and characterizes all compact surfaces as well as proves the simplicial approximation theorem). There are hints and answers to the exercises which are numerous and vary in difficulty. I think this is the best all around book Dover offers on topology; Maunders is completely in a league of its own."
2,"Not Funny, Professor","While a good sense of humor is as necessary to reading (and hopefully to learning) topology as is mental acuity, self-serving Reviews by Authors are offensive and similar ""contributions"" by Authors' relatives (if that is in fact what we have here)are even more so given the price of textbooks these days. Why doesn't the good professor submit the results of a survey of his students (anonymous and conducted by someone other than himself, we would hope)who have used this book as a text? Better yet, would the professor submit an open letter to a peer-reviewed journal soliciting such evaluations from colleagues at other schools which haveused his text?"
4,Good album!,"Barbra Streisand's 1971 album BARBRA JOAN STREISAND is a pleasant album from an exceptional singer. The album has her intrepreting songs by more contemporary artists from that year. At that point in her career, she was known mostly as a broadway star, having only mild success with her music career. The album before this one, STONY END, was a nice comeback, and this album followed in a similar vein. She interprets songs by John Lennon (""Mother"", ""Love""), Carole King (""Where You Lead"", ""Beautiful"", ""You've Got A Friend""), Laura Nyro (""I Never Meant To Hurt You""). Overall a nice collection of pop/rock songs. She wouldn't follow this formula with her next album, but it is nonetheless a great effort in her catalog of albums!"
5,Barbra Joan Streisand: Since We Fell For Her,"This 1971 album is what happens when a record producer with strength of vision and conviction takes the helm. Under Richard Perry's impeccable direction, Barbra Streisand brings theatrical élan to songs written by her contemporaries: Burt Bacharach, Carole King, John Lennon, Laura Nyro, Steely Dan. The performances, wrapped in Mr Perry's consistent production values, sound as fresh today as they did in the early seventies. Highly recommended tracks: ""One Less Bell To Answer/A House Is Not A Home"" and ""Since I Fell For You."""
4,an invitation to streisand,"this is the disc that i would recommend as an introduction to barbra streisand.she completed the transition to pop and rock heavy recitals with this album. and she was nowhere near as indulgent as she would get with the soundtrack to 'a star is born' and 'streisand superman'.something else had on this disc was the personnel, which included the millington sisters, nicky barclay and billy preston. these presences insured brilliant performances of the lennon and carole king songs chosen.she also stretched in to the realm of light jazz with her lush cover of laura nyro's 'i never meant to hurt you' and kept her more mature fans satisfied with symphonically colored covers of 'the summer knows' and 'since i fell for you'.extremely tasteful, eclectic and beautifully done!"
1,Only Barbra!,"Only Barbra could make an album featuring Jim Gordon AND Billy Preston suck!This is especially incredible considering it was recorded at the peak of their careers.This album seems to be a cynical attempt to capture the never to be repeated energy of the era's rock music, sanitize it, package it and sell it at the A&P; to suburban moms.Compare, for example, the lame ""Space Captain"" on this with either the Joe Cocker original, or even the Black Crowes 1990's cover.Compare this with the other albums which came out in this era, and you will see how hopelessly dated, programmed and dead it isThis album is a shameful corruption of a magical time, and a painful listen as well."

4,Simply Barbra,"Let's be brief: the sequel to ""Stoney End"" is better! Barbra rocks, Barbra swings and Barbra coos her way through a much more equilibrated choice of songs. My personnel favorites are ""A house is not a home/ One less bell to answer"" and ""The Summer knows"". If you liked ""Stoney End"" you will LOVE this one."
4,Black Mozart,"Chevalier Saint-Georges was called 'The Black Mozart'. If you like the (only 5) violin concerts form Mozart, you'll sure like these concerts from Saint-Georges!"
3,More about Rick's friend and 2 wives than anything....,"I agree with a previous reviewer that there was terrific subject potential here that was lost in mediocre writing. Far too much detail about Dan Hill, Rescorla's time in Africa and his two wives and not enough about his part in VietNam and on 9/11. Glad I read it, just wasn't very impressed with it when it was over compared to what I had expected given the ironic turns of fate in Mr. Rescorla's life and his heroic ways."
5,The Bond Between Men,"Not since the story of Jonathan and David from the Bible has such a wonderful picture of male friendship been presented.1Sa 18:3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.In this day of sexual immorality and homophobia, men are afraid to be true friends and never experience the bonding and cameraderie that can develop from such a friendship. Bonds such as that are often only formed through war or intense danger.I highly recommend this book to any man who lacks a true brother-in-arms."
5,Heart of a Soldier,"The story is very thought provoking. As a retired reservist, I found it very compelling. His own values and the military discipline made him the person he was. He was truely a hero. I enjoyed his evolution as well as his friends and the love of his life."
5,Mother's Little Helper,"As someone who suffers anxiety and lives in an anxiety producing environment (Bronx, New York), Lunasom has helped me cope. Yes, I use it to sleep, but I also use this to deal with the anxiety I get from the constant noise, music, you know, the trials and tribulations of city living.When used as a sleep aid, it only relaxes you, and there is absolutely no next day hangover. I've brought this around five times and will continue to do so.SiouxieThe Bronx"
1,Can't cancel product,I have been unable to reach anyone by telephone to CANCEL the automatic shipments and charges to my credit card. Be cautious in giving your credit card or debit card to purchase. They are quick to take your money but hard to reach after 1st shipment. Unhappy in New Mexico
4,Makes a great root beer float!,Torani's regular syrups are made with pure cane sugar. I use the root beer syrup with SodaStream carbonated water to make great root beer soda and floats.
2,Where the nutrition facts?,I am no bimbo but I don't want my teeth to fall out? I got visit Dentist almost twice a year and its not exactly enriching to see item without sugar content and fat content and calories per serving? Is this a fake product?
2,"A book about sex, not how babies are made","If you are looking for a book strictly about sex, this will fill the bill. It does not talk about conception. Topics covered include, nudity, being alone, private parts, etc. This book is not designed to be ""fun"" (my major complaint). The illustrations are simple line drawings and the layout is designed for a child who doesn't need pictures or a story to entertain or interest them."
1,an inappropriately permissive text for young ones,"This is an ""anything goes"" book for youngsters. It asks kids if and how they self stimulate but has a strangely coy attitude to nudity."
2,Lacks information,"This book would be a good choice in introducing you to mice. But, if you already own mice then it will be of no help to you. It has only the basic information you need to know. Such as feeding, housing, training, and caring for your pet mouse. It has a section about breeding, though it is brief. Also the breeding section is very callous by reccomending that you cull mismarked baby mice from litters. Any respectable breeder would not do this, and sell the mice as pets only. Over all I would say this book is not a good read."
2,"I thought these were new episodes, but they are not.","I was disappointed because I assumed since this was a new DVD that it contained new episodes. My son informed me that he had all the episodes except for one already. At least he has a new train engine to play with. If you have a lot of Thomas DVD's already, there is probably nothing new for you on this one. :("
4,like it,"bought fot my grandson, arrived on time for christmas. He was very happy. Highly recommend for boys. Good price too"
4,Thomas CD,Product arrived in a timely manner and is excellent condition. Thomas is my Grandson's favorite character. We shop on Amazon together and he chooses the items to put in our wish list.
3,Not wooden train,I agree with the other poster. There is nothing on the box to indicate which style of Thomas sets this works with. I'm glad we figured this out before we gave it to our son for the holidays.
5,Great Work!!,"This is probably the best contemporary music I have ever heard from any of the bands, Though one tends to think that there is repetition once in a way, its worth it. A serious recommend for anyone who likes soothing and meaningful music."
5,10 BIG SPANKING STARS!!!!!!,"These guys are absolutely incredible! This DVD finally captures the entire essence that is the Asylum Street Spankers. Their musicaly ability is incredible and has been evidenced on their past CDs, but this DVD finally gets the whole scene down. It's not just the notes, sounds and words, it's the facial expressions and actions that create their unique form of acoustic vaudville-ish performances. If you can sit through this and not be alternately amazed and on the floor doubled over in laughter...then you definitely need some help! Buy it!"
3,You get what you pay for,"First off, these locks are incredibly cheap, as you can see by the price, but it is not only the price that is cheap. Unlike many gun locks of this style, when unlocked, the cable doesn't spring out, and must be manually pulled. Of course in order to unlock it, one has to fiddle with the key that somehow has trouble going into the lock. Turning the lock has a loose and cheap feel to it also.I bought 3 of these that were ""keyed alike"" and only got 2 that used the same key, while the other was doing its own thing.Of course you might wonder, do they even work? The answer is yes. I can't say I have put any major stress on them as I don't really want to break my new gun lock, but they locked and stayed on my gun when I put them there, so unless someone REALLY wants to use your gun, I'm sure enough that it is safe.The item works, but for the cheap build quality and lack of keyed alikeness, I'm giving this a 3. For $5 I'd say that they work alright though."
2,"Poor quality, but works","I bought this as a motorcycle helmet lock, for which it works great except the lock itself is is totally cheap. I don't even care so much about the level of security, as this is just a deterrent so somebody can't easily walk off with my helmet; but locking it and unlocking it takes forever. To unlock, when you turn the key it doesn't just release or even disengage so you can pull the pin out, you have to wiggle the key to get it to disengage, and at the same time wiggle the pin while tugging. Then to lock it, it's just as difficult. You don't need the key, but the pin doesn't fit well and has to be wiggled and forced. Like I mentioned, this type of lock with this length of cable is perfect to use as a motorcycle helmet lock,but I would shop around for one with a better lock. The only thing I would add is both the lock and cable are wrapped in a rubber casing and shouldn't scratch your motorcycle, which is why I chose this model. However, for $5 you get what you pay for."
2,Master Lock product made in China,"I bought 8 of these all keyed alike. As they are Master brand locks I was expecting typical Master Lock quality. They are NOT the high quality that Master has always been known for. These locks were made in China, poorly. If I had known that these were of Chinese manufacture I would not have bought them. Like so much other mechanical stuff that needs to be made to fairly tight and consistent tolerances, these Chinese goods just don't ""have it""."
5,It does the job well...,"I purchased this for my Nikkor 60mm f/2.8 micro lens. I don't understand why it's not included in the Nikon R1 Close-up Speedlight Remote Kit though. Anyway I was stuck with my 105mm f/2.8 micro lens without this adapter ring, now I can use my 60mm lens with this ring too. Simply it does the job."
3,I wrecked them 2 weeks in :(,"I absolutely love the colors and look of these dishes, and they are very heavy and seem very durable. We registered for cobalt, plum, cinnabar, and periwinkle settings for our wedding and just started using them 2 weeks ago when we returned from our honeymoon. We've been stacking them in the cupboard just like any dishes because they certainly looked like they could handle it, but yesterday I noticed that many of them are covered with scratches from being stacked! I can't believe it! They are deep enough that they can't be rubbed away and are really noticeable on my dark dishes. I'm so bummed; I didn't have any idea that stacking them would wreck them (never bothered any of my other dishes), and there weren't any special care instructions that came with the dishes. So while these are fantastic, I would take into consideration that they apparently destroy each other in the cupboard :("
5,"Very nice, durable and attractive","I like this place setting color, but I have taken the advice of others and I use coffee filters between pieces for storage. It is a great place setting."
5,Love this color!!,"I have about a ton of FIESTA. I purchased this set because it's the ""NEW"" color.... and I just have to get all the new colors! Everyone especially likes this color in our house.... You'd think its actually ""lucky"" the way my kids fight over whose turn it is to use it! I think I may have to get another set. :)"
5,shamrock fiesta,The dishes are beautiful. The glazing is intact. I hope to order other colors. Thank-you for you quick service in replacing the damaged piece.
4,ivory fiesta ware,I really like the set although the coffee cup is very small. I have not had any problems yet with scratches on the plates that I read about in some other comments. These were a great price and looks great with the red and black set i already have.
2,"Usually great, but not this batch","I order the chocolate color for my mom and my grandmother for Christmas/Hanukkah. They are avid collectors, I mean they have almost all the colors and were so excited when they saw the chocolate. However, the one that my mom ended up getting had scratches and bubbles in the glaze. We were all shocked by this because we have never had a bad looking set of fiestaware and they have been buying it for every occasion(birthday's, christmas, hanukkah, mother's day etc). My parents sent the plates back to Amazon(in December) and they still haven't received their replacement ones yet. I am curious if this is a problem that everyone has had with the chocolate color or is it just the set they got, and does it normally take this long for a replacement to be sent out?Really, other than this issue they have loved fiestaware and been very happy with every set."
2,Worst Little Tour of Whorehouse,"Roxie Lucas saves this review from having a single star. Her performance was the shining star in a rather lifeless, dusty, and uninspired revival of the original production which thankfully avoided Broadway. Compare with the rollicking original recording and you will easily notice the lack of life, spirit and vibrancy in the new recording. The addition of A Friend to Me added nothing to the score but sluggish redundancy."
1,"GHASTLY, GOD-AWFUL AND THOSE ARE THE KINDEST WORDS....","....I can say about this sad, slapped together, make a quick buck tour starring Ann-Margret. Speaking of slapped all involved deserve a slap and Ann-Margret deserves a couple of slaps for signing on to this. Don't get me wrong, I love Ann-Margret(even had a secret crush on her in her Bye Bye Birdie days) but at 20 singing in a breathy, sex-kittenish baby voice-to some it might sound sexy--at 60+ using that same singing style-it sounds like asthma.This review is really useless since it is now unavailable but if someone is ever crazy enough to re-release it. You Have been warned.The original cast album is still the best and if you are a bit masochistic, I guess you could try The Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton lame version."
5,I really hope this production makes it to video,"As an Ann-Margret fan I had to get this version.As a fan of the show I discovered an added bonus.I went running to the Broadway Box Office for a ticket to the evening show as soon as I saw the bastardized film version of this musical.Having met the ""real"" Miss Mona during the original Off-Broadway run I was aware that her one criticism of the show was that Good Old Girl seemed to imply she'd been more than friends with the sheriff.I was therefore totally offended ,as I'm sure she was ,that in order to incorporate Dolly's new songs the film was all about the affair that never happenned.And they cut Bus to Amarillo .What were they thinking? This CD and production feature a new song ""A Friend to Me"" sung by Ann-Margret (and Carol Hall on the CD).I'd like to publicly thank Miss Hall for setting the record straight.Edna would be pleased!"
3,Nice sword but difficult to contact dealer,"The final outcome was fair and the product is a good one at a fair price. The product originally sent was defective. It ultimately was replaced with no additional shipping and handling charges. Arriving at the fair settlement was frustrating. The dealer didn't contact me in earnest until I posted a negative review on the Amazon website, and had gotten Amazon customer service involved. The negative review was removed from the website after the eventual satisfactory resolution of my consumer complaint."
5,Rinku17,"It's a nice balanced sword and sharp, and you can see your reflecting in the sword! but it's a great practiceing sword."
5,Works Great,I purchased this to replace the remote that came with opener (and the house). It works better than expected. We can open the garage from the street.
1,Wrong article,It has not the same charactaristics as the one I needed which means I cannot use it. Technical specifications were insufficient. No installation instructions were included.
5,Much better than the US version,"There are a total of 21 tracks on this album--9 more than the US version, but there are more than 9 tracks that can be found on this version and not the US release. Some of the songs on the US version are not on this CD, but the songs that are included more than make up for it. There are some great songs that have been featured on the show that are included on the UK CD and were not featured on the US version. Compared to this version, the only thing that makes the US release worth owning is the hard to find ""Prayer of St. Francis"" by Sarah McLachlan. I'd actually recommend getting both CD's, but if you only want to get one, the UK version is the better choice, despite the fact that it's much more expensive."
4,The best scrapper I've used,This scraper simply works. Carbide blade is tough especially if you accidentally scraped over an unseen nail head. The blade stays sharp and does not need as frequent sharpening comparing to the cheaper Chinese made products from your home improvement stores. The only complain is the leverage knob is not easily removable to permit working in narrow spaces.
5,Great hand tool,"I used this scraper to remove paint from cedar trim on my house. Easy to use, effective at removing paint and unlike other scrapers - I didn't end up gouging the cedar. The handle feels good in my hands and natural to use."
2,Nice scraper but,"The carbide blade that came with the scraper was bad. When it was used the results looked like I had used a corregated knife. It cut shallow groves in the wood in places and left paint in others. Both sides of the blade were the same. Replacement blades cost $10, almost half the price of the tool. I also purchased the smaller scraper and it was fine and did a great job."
1,"Very very marginally OK, but with real problems","Not the best quality, one side of slots for plastic shades/inserts had brad/nail about an inch above bottom. Rather than send back, clipped off edge of plastic shades on that side so that nail would not prevent insertion. Amazon advertizes as Walnut but color was really black. Of two phillips screws in bottom, the pre-drilled hole on one side not deep enough. Sorry product for price, Amazon would be wise to drop. Would not recommend or buy again."
3,Nice looking but a little flimsy,"I love the look of this lamp in our living room. It has a very unique design and I like it because it does not look like a typical lamp. I do not like how light weight and flimsy feeling it is. Its tall and slender and the base is not very heavy which means it wobbles around a lot and will fall over if the table its on gets bumped.All and all, not a bad deal for the price."
5,Understanding the stone craved animals of Southwest Tribes,"A great overview of fetishes, charms, and amulets made by Southwest Indian tribes. I like the mix of stories from Indian's folklore and the power from the fetish would provide to user. Now my collection of fetishes have now taken more meaning and understandings from Indian point of view. Also there is notes about material used in making the fetish. Why the color plays great role in fetish. Great reading and must reading if you collect fetishes from Southwest."
4,Fun read with great characters,"I really enjoy this series. It is similar to 'Stephanie Plum' by Janet Evanovich in that the main female character is pretty sassy and independent yet still has the real quirks we all have. There are times those quirks may be a bit over the top however, it is fiction and meant to be a fun read. There is plenty of humor and of course, the hot guy(s). The series is a good mix of mystery, romance, and humor."
4,Hilarious!,"This book is a wonderful start to a series that just keeps getting better! Chrissy is a great character, her friend Laney is the best friend we all want and Jack Rivera rivals Ranger in the hot and protective department. The books are a bit like the early Plum books but Greiman is a better, more daring writer than Evanovich has turned out to be. The whole series is a light and funny read and I highly recommend it!"
1,Crap. I don't think this stuff does anything at all.,"I came across this because a colleague of mine in Germany orders a similar product, which he has sent to me and I forward on to him. It is supposed to quell inflammation of the joints after long runs (he is a marathoner and I do biathlons).I was really interested in the effects of this after reading a couple of good reviews, but I can honestly say, after two months nothing happened for me.Perhaps if you want something to work badly enough it might have a placebo effect, but for me it just didn't do a thing.Sorry."
1,great disappointment,"It seems that the aim of the writers is to sell FCS systems instead of explaining how they work. They always compare FCS systems with other systems (such as MRP systems); but how can you compare systems that are supposed to do quite different things? After reading the whole book i can say, my knowledge of the matter is the same as before. I could have used my time (and money) better."
1,This was not a good way to buy a diamond!,"I was pretty sure what size diamond I wanted to replace. I just did some research online to determine if the color and clarify listed would be sufficient. Once I received the diamond (J-K Color, I3 Clarity) it looked like it had a piece of thread on it. I wiped it off with a soft cloth, looked at it through a jeweler's loop, which I just happen to have in my desk, and saw realized that thread was a huge inclusion throughout the top of the diamond. It could be seen clearly with the naked eye and not using 10X magnification as the learning guides say. Realizing my mother can't see very well and time was too short, I gave it to her for Christmas anyway. I just hope she doesn't let anyone with good eyesight see it up close."
3,Not so good,"When I received the ring I looked a black stain in the diamond, as a point.This stain is located into de diamond and can't be cleaned or removed.It is so bad because I purchased a diamond thinking that it is almost perfect. But it is not true in this ring"
2,Flawed Diamond,"It is very cheap for 1/2 carat, but you get what you pay for. The diamond I received has a very visible flaw in the middle. I ended up returning it. Have no complaint about Amazon, which is very fast in shipping and easy on return."
2,"A shadow of Yehoshua's ""The Lover""","I don't like this book.At first it resembles with A.B. Yehoshua'sThe Lover(which I absolutely LOVED), in sampling different characters' perspectives and telling the story in a stream-of-consciousness style, unreliable narrators, marital breakdown by cheating but idealistic wives, and threads of psychological disturbances and emotional complexity. Albeit it sheds interesting points about modern Israeli society such as tensions between Ashkenazim and Sephardim. But this story is abstract in the non-sensical way that it gets in the way of relating to the reader. It's a little ""selfish"", more like a writer/characters' way of mental masturbation by spewing out their notions than truly engaging the reader."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy for my daughter and it has never worked well at all. Now, 2 weeks after purchase it will not blow any bubbles at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone!"
4,Great bathtime fun.,"I bought this so my girls can have a ""bubble bath."" They also love Nemo. This is a great toy. It seems a little heavy, but it has no trouble hanging on the wall of my tub. It puts out a lot of bubbles very fast. And in return, it runs out of the quickly. But that just lets me know that play-time is over. I would have given this more stars, but it sucks battery life away fairly quick. I do recommend this to anyone with kids that like bubbles."
5,Great addition to my decor.,"The colors perfectly fir in with my furniture and decor. It comes rolled up in a poster tube. I unraveled it, stuck it in the frame a bought, and hung it. If - in a few years - I decide I'm sick of the colors I've got in my living & dining rooms, I can pick a color in my poster and redo the room based on it. Voila! New Contempory room."
1,Have not recieved after 1 month,It has been 1 month since I ordered this and I still have not received the book. Unhappy as I don't like to throw away money.
3,Buyer Beware,"In a nutshell, if you are buying this map of Hokkaido as your guide while driving, beware. My friend and I thought this map would be sufficient, but it's not. Some areas are questionable and do not provide enough detail. If you plan to rent a car and drive, then feel free to buy this map (since it's in English and will provide some help) but I strongly suggest that you also get a hold of a detailed Japanese map. Together, you should be able to get around.That's basically what we did: we used the English map as a general guide and the Japanese map for the fine details. While you probably won't be a reader of Japanese, you can usually guess where you are and what route to take.Good luck. Hokkaido is a beautiful place and driving around the island is easy, safe, and enjoyable."
3,"Without Kathy Young, well they're...","Okay, I'm not bashing this group, but the cd is very low key. Nothing stands out at all, very (pardon the pun) monotone! It's great to see all the stuff on one cd as a collector, but without Kathy Young... well... just buy it and you be the judge.Don't worry about the quality, it's clear and crisp from the master tapes with false starts and a great booklet."
4,Innocents,"Not a bad CD, some music is on the edge for fifties/sixties music. If you like oldies, this would be a good edition to your collection."
3,"Without Kathy Young, they are...","Okay, I'm not bashing this group, but the cd is very low key. Nothing stands out at all, very (pardon the pun) monotone!

5,The most Amazing Book EVAR!!!!,"This book documents acrynoms in best and funniest way possible, a must for any coffee table or math room. Can't wait for the second edtion!"
5,A Wonderful Read in the Pyschology of Religion,"What are the different religious orientations? How do we develop religiously? How is religious development like creativity? These are questions that Batson, Ventis, and Schoenrade try to answer in this work in the social psychology of religion.Given much attention is Batson's Quest theory of religious orientation. Batson is the leading proponent of this theory and in a number of chapters he explains and defends it against the criticisms that have naturally been lobbed against it.I believe that his theory is robust enough to be acceptable. It certainly has intuitive appeal, as well as basis in Buddhist philosophy and mystical religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity.This a laudible work in the psychology of religion. It has depth and focus not be found in other introductory works in this field of study.[This work was previously entitled ""The Religious Experience"" (sans Schoenrade) ]"
2,"Dont know where the ""molded"" description applies","I already own the Smashball brand of these paddles. They are wood and they warped soon after purchase. I found these on amazon, according to the description ""two molded flourescent paddles"" and other reviewers' comaring this product to wood paddles, I believed I was getting plastic paddles. However what just arrived IS wood, and IS already warped.I wonder if the one reviewer who says the product is used in the pool actually did get a plastic version. There is no way the item I received could be used in the pool.That being said, the game is fun. I would just prefer a flat paddle rather than a warped one."
5,This is a must for the true Thompson Twin Fan!,"This video is The Thompson Twins at the peak of their career. Not only is it a live concert, but it is also a sort-of documentary, showing the band touring with their discussions/comments.It is from their ""Into the gap"" tour shot at the Del Mar Racetrack in California. The album by the same name topped the charts as well did the one Twins single to hit #1; ""Hold me now"".Abit dated with it's prominant ""80's"" feel, it is still one helluva great show! HIGHLY recommended!"
4,MicroTemp MT - 100 digital Infrared Thermometer,Good thermometer very handy to check window temp and around doors. Have used it for about 2 weeks seems to have everything I expected and the price was OK. I would purchase one again and consider it for a gift.
5,Works well,"I use this thermometer when I am working with a heat gun and need to know if a surface is hot or not. I cannot attest to how precise it is. But, it is small, not too expensive, and for what I am using it, does the job great."
5,Nice little gadget!,"I bought this to see how hot a circuit board was getting over time. The MicroTemp is fast and easy to use. I have no way to check its accuracy, but as long as it's not more than a few degrees off I'm happy with it. Just so you know, you do need to be within about an inch of the object to get the most accurate measurement."
5,Works Just Fine,I purchased this thermometer because I wanted a cheap way to check engine temps on a RC car. It seems to be accurate to within a few degrees and it's nice and small. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.
2,More of a toy than a tool.,"It was acutally a lot smaller than I expected, almsot like a BIC lighter. That could be good for some, but it did seem to me a somewhat cheap construction.While it has performed problem free since getting it a few motnhs ago, i do have issues with its accuracy. It seems to always be 3-4 deg F cooler than when tested with other more accurate devices, including a 150$ temeprature gun I borrowed.This probably wouldn't be a problem for most though, as it is still great to use as a qucik benchmarking tool, and for comparing different surfaces. But for me, I ended up paying about 35$ to get a more precices temperature gun with laser."
5,Knipex Cobra,"These are GREAT! Better gripe than any other pliers or vice grips. If you don't have any buy the 3 size option. I bought these for my husband to add to his motorcycle tool kit but he uses them for any task you would use pliers, etc."
5,Best price on the 'net,"Product very fresh, fast shipping, best price I've found. I'll definitely do business with Fasigs again."
3,not that easy,"I thought it would be easier to learn pharmacology through this INCREDIBLY easy thing, but actually our text book is soooo much better. For me - waste of money. Otherwise, our textbook is $80, so if I didn't have it, then it would be ok to learn from this one. Even though infois not full."
2,Its outdated,"Well it does not work, it is useless waste of money, thankfully amazon refunded me because it did not work cuz it is so old."
5,It made it easy for me,"The book really helped me because it was soooo easy to understand. Actually, its better than my textbook."
2,Not Inceadibly Easy!,"Is a great book! You may use it as a reference, but not as a learning tool. I would not recommend for visual learners!"
4,Basic information Fast!,"This is a very basic book that is easy to access on my Android. Instead of carrying my pharmacology book and my drug book to clinicals, I just use my phone to look up information that I need quickly. It will not replace a good technical drug book, but if you need the basics fast, this is the way to go."
5,Nursing Pharmacology made easy,"My daughter is a nursing student and requested this book, to help her study for the exam. She likes it. I got three different NCLEX books for her."
5,I disagee with the Advanced degree Snob,"The purpose of this series is not to TEACH. It provides a testing tool; practice questions for exam or NCLEX prep. If you want to learn about calcium channel blockers, read your textbook or turn to one of Lippincotts other books. I also recommend Lippincott's Clinical Pharmacology Made Incredibly Easy book. The text my prof used in my pharm class was very poor. But I read it anyway. Then, when I was beginning my prep for each exam, I would read through the Made Incredibly Easy chapters in the drug classes specific to what my exam would cover. Then I would use the software to practice. I found this very helpful with probably THE hardest class a nursing student has to slog through."
4,Good Adjunctive,I think this book is a good adjunctive to a text book. I generally read a chapter after I read the same subject in my test book. It works as a great review and wraps things up. I would not toss my text book out for this one however.
3,Nursing Pharmacology Made Incredibly Easy! (Incredibly Easy! Series) (Paperback),"I purchased this book based on the recommendation of other nursing students. This book is easy to read. However, this book lacks information that is essential for nursing students taking a pharmacology course. The information which needs to be added to future editions is the trade and generic drug names of each drug and the mechanism of action of each drug mention in the book. I hope the editors will make these improvements. However on the positive side this book has easy to read introductions of the different drug types."
3,This book is just ok,"I have several books from the Incredibly Easy series but this one kind of disappointed me. I wish they would have included more illustrations and mneumonics, to help you memorize the content."
2,MAP MEASURING TOOL,"I am a BSA volunteer and I read different types and scales of maps. I was disappointed with the roller. It seems that the roller [measuring wheel] slides on the paper and will not give you an accurate reading. To verify its accuravy, I measured a section of a road that I knwe to be 5 miles. The tool measured 4 miles on a city map. After purchasing the tool, I do not feel that I can trust it."
3,Good for home use,"Accurate product description and prompt delivery. You will need good eye sight to read the very finely printed scale on either side of this map measurer. This is more of a tool for home use (trip planning) than for road travel or hiking. My measurer arrived slightly damaged, probably through shipping. The protective plastic lens had fallen off and had to be carefully reglued."
1,Wrong Dvd,This is the wrong Dvd!!!!!!!!!!!The one you get will not be a 2 dvd set! This is the metal one dvd. Complete different bands also than the ones listed.
3,"well researched, but you better have some time on your hands","LaFeber certainly makes logical conclusions from factual evidence which lends credibility to his work. His thesis, that you have to examine the deep historical roots of the US-Japanese relationship to understand the causes of their many clashes in the 150 year relationship, is proven time and time again in the book. Not good bedtime reading unless you need help sleeping."
4,great gift,"One of the cleverest,well-written, and fun tiny books for all your friends who enjoy their religion and have a good sense of humor to boot!!"
5,Perfect condition and exactly as remembered,exactly what we were looking for. we had this book when are children grew up and it was destroyed in a flood. Now with a grandchild we wanted the same book. We ordered two. They came and were brand new and in perfect condition
5,Excellent scissors,Anyone doing applique needs these scissors in their basket. I purchased both the small and larger non-stick scissors and they are excellent. The fusible webbing doesn't stick to them and they cut perfectly. I've used mine hundreds of times and they just keep on doing their job.
3,Civility during War,"Neither you nor I know what it was it was in the '60's, the 1860's.Historians gather sheet music, diaries, contempory reviews...but we just don't know exactly. We, as Americans, have a shared experience of mountain ballads, field shouts, and a wide-eyed determination to make ourselves proven to the world as one united states with our own music and tradition.This CD works well as a teaching tool for elementary school kids to let them hear their history, and for adults, a reminder of the legacy of our forefathers."
1,Better Homes and Gardens Healthy Cooking CD Cookbook,"I received this cd as a Christmas gift. To this day, we haven't been able to get the CD to work. This gift was a disappointment."
5,Great fit - Protects your K3,"I purchased K3 a few months ago, and since it's so small, I needed a case to cover it. I had read about this Belkin case and I decided to order it.When I received the item from Amazon, I immediately placed my K3 into it. It's a tight fit. It has a belt clip that holds tight when I'm at the gym. It also has a solid arm band with velcro closure.There is a slit on the side that allows you to access the On-Off switch on the side of the K3. The hole for the ear phone plus fits well. You can open the velcro cover to access the USB plug to re-charge when not in use.The see through cover allows you to easily control the touch pad controls of the K3 and at the same time, prevent from getting your K3 scratched up.A good product."
2,Doron Swade's Quest to Build a Difference Engine,"This is the first book I've read on Charles Babbage, but I imagine that there are others that are better. First, this book seems to assume you've already read a book or two about Babbage before. It almost has an apologetic tone and seems to be an answer to what, I assume, have been slights against Babbage and his work. Second, this book is as much about the author and his quest to build a Difference Engine as it is about Babbage himself. If you want to hear about dealing with office politics in an British museum, you may find this interesting.All in all, this is a fairly dry read. It was interesting at points, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for your first book on Babbage."
3,Hard to follow,"I bought this book hoping to gain a better knowledge of Charles Babbage and of course entertainment. The knowledge part was delivered but I found this book a very hard read. Do not expect to laugh occasionally because the story is very dry. The book also assumes that the reader is very familiar with British history, which I am not. From a factual standpoint it does deliver but its layout and the storyline make it an awful reference resource."
4,The Disobedient Mistress by Lynne Graham (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Mistress in name only? Misty Carlton is shocked when Leone Andracchi offers to help her out of financial difficulty. Surely there must be a catch? There is ... The ruthless and sexy Sicilian tycoon needs her to pose as his mistress for a couple of months! Misty is compelled to take on the job. After all, Leone has asked her to be his mistress in name only. How hard can that be? But quietly, Leone is struggling to resist this beautiful woman he's brought into his life. She's gotten under his skin like no one ever before. Is it too late to change the plans he's set in motion?"
2,"Badly written, but ok story","An unlikely but entertaining story, it's far from my favorite. If you can get past flowery writing and stereotypical alpha male and weak woman, it's not awful. Those are common in romance but this book really takes it past my limit.Under 200 pages, yet padded with excessive description. No physical feature is mentioned without adjectives, often more than one, including synonyms, though the feature has been described before. Their eyes and hair are mentioned constantly and never without naming colors.Leone is really just a jerk. Misty rebukes him several times and he puts her in her place, despite deserving her rebuke. He all but fights any man who tries to talk to her."
3,This Book is Okay,I love Lynne Graham books but I only gave this one three stars because it is not as good as many of the others she has written. I really recommend Bond of Hatred or the Bankers Convenient Wife. Those are really entertaining with feisty heroines who are not doormats. This one is okay but the ones mentioned are better.
2,This was a bore,"I usually read a Harlequin for fast, relaxing, but good storytelling-reading, and some of them are very successful in that respect, but this one was truly terrible! I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was weak and spineless (and lived up to her horrible name, Misty), and the hero was a typical Alpha male. Some of the Harlequins surprise you with the depth of good writing and real tenderness between the characters, but there are no such nice surprises here! Very disappointing effort from this author."
2,Useless for an nVidia 8800GTS card,"My temps before the insertion of this fan were 57c idle/67c load.After insertion, with the switch set to ""H"" the temps were 57c idle/64c load.In order to have the fan fit with the extender tube attached, the bottom clip had to be removed -- or else it wouldn't seat properly in the case. Pity there's no proper documentation to confirm things, so you just read it here. :) The clip can be effortlessly reattached as long as you don't break it off with force.For this high-end video card, the fan just has no effect. For low-mid level video cards, it probably does what it claims on the packaging.And it is a pretty shade of blue."
2,all pond heaters,"All pond heaters suck. I have tried most on the market. You can`t tell if they are functioning untill it is to late. Most never work the second season. If they would put a small led on top that lights up when heating cycle is operating,it would make things less stressful for the pondkeeper. This one is no exeception."
2,Didn't last long.,"The de-icer worked as it should for 3 months, then filled with water, sank, and stopped heating. The manufacturer replaced it, but the replacement stopped heating after only one season of use."
4,So far problem appears to be fixed,"This type of de-icer does seem perpetually flawed. They aren't watertight, and they fill with water and break (especially the black Thermo-Pond). This one did have that problem but appears to have been improved. This is the 2nd season it's been working great, and my local pond store guy says they have addressed the defect. I'll write an update if it fails."
4,Received promptly,I got the product quickly. I will put it into the pond this weekend . Not sure if it works or not.
4,thanksgiving book,"This is a helpful book, especially if you haven't ""done"" thanksgiving before. A great primer for everything you need to know (how to make stock) and a glossery of terms in the back plus lots of great recipes."
2,Makers of the millennium are from all over the world...,"This book was very okay. It offers a very anglo,Euro-centric view of the past 1,000 years, and is very skewed toward the last 50 years. Too many ""rock stars"" and sports figures for my tastes, and big gaps. I bought this book for my son, and found myself providing alot of caveats. Like how do Madonna and Tiger Woods and Andrew Lloyd Webber shape the world as compared to Albert Einstein, Mao Zedong, and Copernicus? This book makes it hard to imagine the profound influence of Chinese, Persian, Indian, Incan, African cultures on our own. Instead we get a 90 second, myopic refelction of the U.S. In 50 years you would pick up this book and say ""who?"" to the sports stars and actors, and wonder why they would share a page with Dr. King or Elizabeth I. I don't get it."
3,Not that easy!,"Luckily, I did not have to drill holes in my 2003 Ford Windstar, but the installation took me about 2 hours and that is with a vehicle lift and a garage FULL of tools, so I could stand under the van to install it. You will have MANY bolts and nuts left over, since this is a universal.If I had to do all this by laying on the ground, it would have taken about 6 hours. Remember to leave all the bolts LOOSE until you put the last one in."
1,May not fit your vehicle!,"Bought this for a 1999 Dodge Caravan, one of the models for which this hitch claims to work. As installed according to the instructions, it will rub against your exhaust pipe and you will have to keep your spare tire in your trunk. The only way to install it and keep your spare tire is to use an alternate set of bolt holes, which will then cause the hitch to lay about 4 inches from the ground. I even took it to a mechanic just to make sure I wasn't missing something and he confirmed that this hitch is simply not as universal as advertised.Spend a few extra bucks and buy a hitch specifically made for (or definitely known to work with) your vehicle instead of this ""universal"" hitch."
1,Does not fit Vans with Stow and Go Seating!!!,"I am normally a cautious person and have worked for years on cars, trucks, and jeeps. I bought this item after checking the website and it indicating it would fit a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan.However, that is not the case. After getting the box, and finally getting time to install it I find out it will not fit 2005 Dodge Grand Caravans with Stow and Go Seating/Storage.This was a waste of my time and money and the product should at least state caveats in the description when checking if it will fit or not.I will probably not be ordering parts from Amazon again. Pro-tip Call the manufacturer directly next time."
3,Does NOT fit Toyota Tacoma!,"Amazon says this hitch fits a 2004 Toyota Tacoma. I ordered it and found out the hard way that it does NOT! My order arrived and the instructions did not seem to make any sense so I called Reese. The customer service rep said that the only hitch Reese has that fits my truck is #33025.It might be a great quality hitch, but it does not fit my truck."
3,Rides TOO LOW !,"I have a 2000 Town and Country.... I had to REMOVE my bumper to get bolts into frame.. NOT easy, Luckily I have a huge assortment of mechanic tools and an impact wrench.. This receiver, in my estimation hangs TOO LOW for a Town and Country... My hitch carrier BOTTOMED OUT going up my Sisters driveway, and yesterday my van needed to be towed and hitch GOUGED my driveway going up tow truck ramp ! I mounted it on the TOP of the brackets too ! If you have a Chrysler Town and Country, go for a hitch with receiver IN LINE with cross bar, NOT welded beneath it !!!!!"
4,Reese hitch 37042,A good fit for a Town and Country with stow and go. Fairly easy to install. Looks good on van.
1,JUNK,"Don't buy this multi fit receiver, it will make you crazy. The instructions are BAD.. It will take you a long time to fit to your car or truck. Spend a little more money and get a receiver that is made for your car or truck.."
1,"If I could rate negative stars, I would give a -5 stars.","When asked to enter the make of the vehicle(Toyota), model (Sienna), sport package (XLE), I was happy to find out the hitch could be sent out in 5 days.When it arrived, it DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE to fitting my vehicle (2 days before a planned vacation where we NEEDED to use the hitch)!After checking on the return policy, contrary to what I was told when ordering that returns were ""free"", the return shipping would be $50.00 out of my own pocket. I attempted to make some changes to make the hitch fit,(additional expense/aggravation) but chaulked it all up to experience...$150.00+ worth.My advice: Go to ""Fleet Farm/Fleet Supply/Menards"" etc. and get the right one the first time and spare yourself the hassle.P.S. If you have ""stow-and-go"" seats in your van, THIS IS NOT the hitch for you!"
1,not a milti-fit,Text claims it will fit a 1985 GMC S15 Jimmy. Doesn't even come close!! I tried to go to the listed website for help and just got bounced around to different search engines. Finally called Reese direct and was told they don't have a listing for my vehicle. Tried the chev equivalent and it listed a different hitch. I am returning this for a complete refund.
3,Wrong item,I bought the wrong item. I had to return it and order the correct hitch. It did look like it was very well made.
3,reese hitch,fit so good . i thought i did something wrong so i took off and on three times . this was one of the best investments ever thanks.
3,"Fits, but needs better instructions","The instructions were confusing, I had to take it to a garage to get it installed. With a little work with the cutting torch, the mechanic got it on. Other than the installation, it's a solid hitch."
3,"Great product, lousy hardware.","Installed the hitch yesterday on my 99 Grand Caravan. Only had to drill a couple of holes, not actually that bad. The install went fairly smoothly after I removed the two bolts that I broke (my van's not the hitch's)... :S However, when I went to torque the knurl-neck bolts that actually hang the hitch on the brackets, 4 of the 6 of them stripped before I was even close to 90lbs as is in the specs. Had to go pickup a slew of new hardware to actually mount the thing.On my caravan it hangs a little low, not Reese's fault, I think the leafs are sagging a bit. Aside from the crappy bolts to attach it to the brackets it's great and would have otherwise given it a 5 star, but that added about two hours to the '30 min' install time since I had to grind the stupid things out and then find new ones."
2,Incorrect hardware. Box torn up.,"According to the application guide, this product was supposed to fit my vehicle. According to the instructions it is supposed to bolt right on, using existing nuts on the vehicle frame. None of the bolts that came with the hitch fit these nuts on the vehicle frame. (There are no existing bolts in the frame) Needless to say I am dissappointed with this. I tried the web sight listed in the instructions for technical support, but the web sight is useless, just a list of search results. So I called the customer service number and can't get to a live person, just recordings.Also, the box was torn open in several places, but everything seemed to be in it.So far not at all pleased with this purchase. Hopefully I will eventually get a hold of customer service, and they can send me the correct bolts."
1,Multi Fit does NOT mean Drilling your Frame!,"This is a good quality Hitch However.....The first sentence in the instructions tells you to start drilling 1/2 inch holes in your vehicles frame AND in the mounting brackets. I thought I was buying a hitch that was ready to bolt up. This wasn't. Unless you are willing, and able to drill your frame and the brackets, (1/2 inch holes) pass on this hitch. Poor instructions didn't help. I guess you can make any hitch fit any car or truck with enough cutting, drilling and modifications....."
3,chevy 2005 express 1500,"This is a decent hitch with lots of different variationsTrying to fit it on a Chevy 2005 express 1500 does not workYou need 40"" from center to center of mounting holes and if you follow the directions you end up with 37""So its the second hole from end for the front bolts.Once this is done and you fit it into place. There is only 6 1/2"" clearance from the groundGet a Chevy specific hitch"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,Bought this for my 2006 Jeep Liberty. It did NOT fit. Totally ignore the cars and trucks that the manufacture list on the box as fitting. They obviously will say ANYTHING to sell this. It's a hit or miss type of deal. And if you do decide to buy it make sure that you are prepared to return it.
2,Reese Towpower,I would not recommend this hitch to anyone. The holes don't line up. Very hard to make fit. Doesn't say Reese anywhere. Buy different Hitch! Seems heavy duty.
5,It wasn't easy but fair enough for my 03 GMC Safari,"I didn't purchase this through amazon as I did not wish to wait and pay for delivery. My local part store had the same exact model and checked out the box and content to make sure it was meant for my vehicle. 2003 GMC Safari extended version.The installation wasn't easy or was it a direct fit without modification. I had to purchase a 1/2 drill bit to drill a hole to my rear bumper bracket. It took me 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete the job. I used a floor jack and two jack stand to complete this job by myself. Be careful on how you handle this thing as it's pretty heavy to be handled on your own, the paint comes off easily.Pro:- Cheap compared to a specific tow hitch.- Class IIICon:- Paint comes off easily.- Need more tools than it recommended."
5,high marks...,"As any who have read an ancient work in translation will tell you, any commentary that is included can be a blinding distraction, or the most illuminating aspect of the literature. In this case, Longenecker's accompanying prose is surely the latter. Benedict's Rule is related to the work of a father with practiced ease and grace. The work is profoundly instructive.In fact, my only gripe is with the slightly unwieldy, slightly overlong introduction. Though it should by no means be skipped, I remember feeling a little anxious to get on to St. Benedict. Very high marks though, I thoroughly recommend this book to any father, or mother for that matter."
1,awful quality,"I've purchased cotton using the same order pulled up from Amazon orders. Usually 10 rolls once or twice per year. The previous batches were great; they unrolled fine, layers were separated with paper, and smooth. The last batch from March 2012 was just terrible. Only partially separated with paper, lumpy, and rolls are narrower on one end than the other. I'd give it less than a 1 if I could and would returned it but used two rolls thinking one was just an anomaly. Looking for a new supplier.The recent batch is paper covered and not the roll pictured."
5,It Was Great to go back then...,"I was one of Jeffrey Wilhelm's 7th grade students, and actually, I am one of the ones who is mentioned in this book. i remember filling out the endless forms for allowing my interviews and work to be allowed into this book.When I was presented with the book in 2000, about 5 years after my 7th grade year, I was excited. The book described my 7th grade reading class experience perfectly, and the techniques were ones that i experienced firsthand, which excited all of my classmates, as well as myself, about reading. I don't think any of us read that much for fun as we did for that class.I read the book from cover to cover, even though only one chapter pertained to me, and i am not going into the teaching field. if you are looking at getting your students, or yourself into reading, get this book."
3,Powerful yet Cumbersome,"Pros:- Powerful juicer- Comes with its own cleaning toolsCons:- Many parts that needs to be cleaned each time you use it- Assembly is a bit cumbersome- LoudJuicers would be more practical if you have to make a lot of juice each time you use it. Just need to store the juice in the ref. Otherwise, if you only need to make a couple of glasses, all the hassle maybe not worth it. You have to assemble the equipment, then you have to clean it and store it back to its place in the shelves. Some parts of this juicer are also sharp and you must be careful handling them.Recommended: Yes (with some trepidation)"
1,Lousy Juicer,"I bought the Jack Lalanne Juicer for my husband for our anniversary he was thrilled to have it he used it once and the second time he went to use it the round base piece busted into 3 pieces now a $100.00 down the drain, I'm going tomorrow to get me a different brand and cheaper least when they tear up you don't feel so bad."
1,NOT FOR SERIOUS JUICER!,Motor blew out when juice ran out sides into motor! Plastic parts do not fit tightly! Struggle to operate! Need key to clean. Waste of money! MY old Panasonic worked well for 30 years!
4,lawgirly: No Customer Service Warped Product Received,"It would have been nice for those who had received the gift and had opened it in February after the return date, were to be able to return the Obviously Defective item from ""lawgirly"" and be able to enjoy the Jack Lalanne Juicer."
4,a great book about more than just wilco,"As someone who likes Wilco, but is not a die-hard fan, I really appreciate the book for what it is: It is not a critic's review, it is not a fan-oriented biography-it is simply a superbly written, well-researched book about all that goes into the loaded concept that is ""making music."" Through his elegant prose, Kot delves into human relationships, band dynamics, artistic struggles, and identity-both personal and public. If you like Wilco, read this book. If you like music, read this book. Or, if you admire those moments when the creative process manages to overcome life's obstacles, read this book."
5,Wilco Insight,"Written Well. Comprehensive. Paints Jay Bennett in the positive light he deserves. I didn't like the light he was given in the Wilco film (too many cheap shots) on a music genius.Jay Bennett allowed the WIlco material to rock.I really liked how the book provided insight into Jeff Tweedy and what has led him to make the decisions he has made. Jeff is brilliant and the book provides insight into this man that will aid in the listening experince.Great Book, a must for the obsessive and hip Wilco / Music fan. Wilco is and will be forever one of the Greatest Rock and Roll Bands."
4,Great read for Wilco fans,"Being a Wilco fan and growing up in a town in southern Illinois not far from where Jeff Tweedy grew up, I bought this book primarily to read about Wilco and Uncle Tupelo's early days.Overall, the book reads more or less like an extended magazine article, like something you'd read in Rolling Stone or Spin, except that it's 250 pages long. As a Wilco fan, I quite enjoyed reading about Jeff Tweedy's early life and some of the background stories to some of their songs. Since the book ends around the time of ""A Ghost Is Born"", it would be nice if Kot writes a follow-up book (or additional chapters to be added in newer versions of this one) about Wilco's more recent years.However, if you are not a Wilco fan, I can't imagine that you'd get much out of this book."
5,Great,"I didn't expect a lot from this book, but the author has very nice writing skills, good sources and it was a surprise that there is a lot of explanation about Uncle Tupelo period. And above all Gret Kot doesn't try to show a pleasant snapshop of Jeff Tweedy, Jay Farrar or Jay Bennett, although he understands the motivations of each other."
3,Tweedy=Zuckerberg and Kot admires The Emperor's new clothes,"While Kot lays out all of the proof that Tweedy is a Zuckerberg like boss that takes credit for the work of his subordinates and fires them to cover his tracks, Kot is the biggest cheerleader amongst ""The Emperor's"" toadies insisting that his garments are of the finest quality despite his obvious nudity. As an art critic I would expect that Kot is familiar with Wolfe's The Painted Word, but he fails to recognize Tweedy's contrararian ""difficult artist"" fraud as the transparent cover for his inadequate artistic technical competence for which he relies on others. For the objective reader, Kot tells a great story about why image always trumps substance, ironically, not understanding himself that he is amongst the facilitators of such an injustice."
1,"Poor Format, Spelling Errors (Kindle Version)",I get very annoyed and am appalled at the LACK OF QUALITY every single Kindle Version of a book I have bought here on amazon. This is no exception. The book it self is good (get the paper version). There are so many spelling; grammatical errors through out this book it became distracting.Something needs to be done immediately to make the distributors of these growing numbers of shoddy Kindle book versions to be on par with the print versions WRT quality and correctness....
1,how to die from boredom,"smug, overblown and self indulgent, this book is all the things Wilco is not."
2,We love Betty,"We love watching Betty, but when I rented this we only got 1 hour. When I rented it it said it was 2 hours long. We would have loved to see the other hour."
4,a must for collectors,"The title ""collector's Item"" is accurate. If you like Grace Slick, and you'd like to hear what ""White Rabbit"" originally sounded like, you must get this CD. The Great Society was not as good in terms of musical talent as Jefferson Airplane was, so that's why I gave this 4 stars instead of five."
2,"Promising, but primitive","Definitely worth hearing for Grace Slick's powerhouse vocals and embryonic versions of two classic Airplane songs. But it's easy to hear why Great Society went nowhere. The instrumentals are pedestrian throughout most of the album, with routine, monotonous drumming and perfunctory, generic guitar work. Once in a while it does catch fire, as on the opening cut, ""Sally."" But most of this stuff is of purely historical interest."
4,I listen often as I may,"As mentioned in my review of the Great Society's ""Born To Be Burned"" CD, I had the pleasure of interviewing 3 of the members of the band for my Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent."" I have been a fan for numerous years and always wish this group had better promotion.If you want the music because you enjoy the Airplane and Grace, that is fine. What will happen is a quick discovery the sounds of the Great Society will stand on their own. The release gives you the 2 posthumously issued live albums.To borrow a phase from Jim Morrison the band could change the mood from glad to sadness. The haunting sounds of Darkly Smiling and Grimly Forming are captivating. Their version of Sally Go `Round The Roses is considered by many to be the definitive.Climb aboard the plane and head back to the city by the bay 1966. The sights are magnificent and the rock and roll is terrific.Be well always,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"""
5,The Great Slick,"When I discovered this CD in a sale bin at a music store, I couldn't believe it. This is Grace Slick before she joined the Jefferson Airplane. Several of the songs went with Slick to the Jefferson Airplane, e.g. White Rabbit. The music is not as polished as Jefferson Airplane, to say the least. However, Slick's vocals dominate the recordings.This may be of historical interest to some, but the CD is great. It stands on its own merits. Give it a try."
4,Grace Slick,Jefferson Airplane is one of my all time favorites. This album is a great view of Grace before Jefferson Airplane.
4,"Yes, it is possible to improve over early Jefferson Airplane","This CD is a reissue of two LPs, ""Consipicuous By its Absence"" and ""How it Was"". ""How it Was"" is an OK record that has its moments. ""Consipcuous"" is very different. Its brilliant. It has a lot of songs that are usually attributed to the Jefferson Airplane. This live recording is not as slick as the Airplane's studio recordings but the songs have a 'feel' to them which is remarkable. This feel carried over a bit to the Airplane but it never really stuck.If you like ""Surrealistic Pillow"" then you'll really like this record. (BTW - While you're here you should check out Jefferson Airplane's ""Takes Off""."
5,Amazing Grace...,"This pre-Jefferson Airplane recording is a must have for any collector! Grace belts it out like no other...this CD proves it. Grace & The Great Society kind of sound like a college band, but they were just 'working out the kinks' in these early years. Too bad some of these other members didn't end up in Airplane, but oh well. The real master here is Grace Slick and she rocks! This disc is an excellant example of the 1960's music scene and what was to later come out of San Francisco and go nationwide."
5,The Great Society Live,"Grace Slick & The Great Society/ Collector's Item: There are only two CDs available from The Great Society as of 2011 (as far as I know), the CD with the studio recordings is called ""Born To Be Burned"" which is a nice CD. However, this Live ""Collector's Item"" CD (known by various names through the years) is a more entertaining CD and is a wonderful artifact from the early years of the San Francisco Scene (aka, the birth of the Hippie). This is far from a perfect live recording but that has not kept it from being one of my favorites. Grace does drop the F-bomb in one of the songs (You rebel hippie chick Slick!) but it is in perfect harmony with the song, the times and the band."
2,Very dim and yellow,"I bought these to use on my garage door opener. The vibrations of the opener were too rough for CFLs, so I wanted to try some rough service bulbs.These Feit bulbs seem very dim, like 60 watt bulbs at best, and the color is extremely yellow / orange. Two of the bulbs on my garage opener barely illuminate the garage, like a bunch of candles.They were inexpensive, but apparently you get what you pay for. I would recommend trying a different brand."
1,Disappointed,"I received the package today expecting a Halex Official Size Volleyball/Badminton Net. Not at all what I received. I opened the box to a cheap Spalding Badminton Net. This was for a party I am having on Monday, now I will not have a Volleyball net to play."
1,Fraudulent Advertising,"As did the previous reviewer, I ordered the pictured Halex net and received a poorly made Spalding net with flawed netting that had to be a ""factory second."" I could not send it back because my children had already set it up and played with it before I saw it. I had one of the pictured Halex nets for several years and was satisfied with it. While it is also an inexpensive net, it seemed to have higher quality tape and netting."
1,Most important part is cheap plastic,I didn't get one use out of this light stand. The tightening ring for the leg support is made form cheap plastic. I tightened it up on my first use and it snapped. The tube is made of high quality aluminum. The rest of the stand appears to be well designed and function. None of that matters however. Lowel should be embarrassed for even trying to keep this product on the market.
5,loved it!,"This is my new favorite toy. It worked well for 2 weeks without re-greasing the gasket after use in salt water. Just be sure to use the flash diffuser, but don't plan on using it at night as it illuminates the debris in the water and that's all you'll get in the picture. You'll need a separate light source if you're taking serious night-time pics. I would recommend getting the weights if you're snorkeling b/c it's a little difficult to free-dive and hold the camera steady at the same time."
5,Wonderful Christmas Memories,"My family owned this compilation on vinyl and played it every year over and over. As my children are growing up I wanted to play it for them but found the album to be in less than desirable condition. I was so excited when I found it in CD format that I bought one for my dad and sisters,too. You know it's a good compilation if it's still around after more than 20 years!"
3,Stick with the Mint ...,"I am a HUGE lover of Frango's Mint Chocolates and a HUGE lover of ALL things Caramel. I figured, ""How can I go wrong""? Well ... I was a little disappointed in the flavor of the Frango Caramels. The caramel filling itself had a slightly stale flavor to it and the filling didn't compliment the chocolate shell the same way the velvety Mint filling does.I will say this ... Target did an AMAZING job of packing these chocolates and shipping them quickly. They came with an ice pack and were sealed inside a foam container inside the shipping box. ORDER CHOCOLATES FROM TARGET.COM WITH CONFIDENCE! (just stick to the plain Mint) :-)"
3,Fresh analysis of a misunderstood movement,"King's work reads a lot like a dissertation with its use of MLA format and cititations. However, that does not diminish the importance of the focus of his work: how Rastafarianism, once a politicaly charge culture, was co-opted by Jamaica and morphed into a tourist friendly cariracture. King's writing becomes a bit repetitive at times (in his analysis of The Gleaner) something the editors should have noticed. A pivatol study for those who are investigating reggae in academic circles despite the high price."
5,Go for Improv,"I highly recommend this book for people interested in incorporating improv in their training, whatever the topic. The book is clear, to the point, very creative and also very practical. Ms Koppett has collected some tried-and-true improv exercises that are easy to use and really work. Even if you have never done any theatre or improv, you can use this book. Just imagine, a training session in which your participants are inspired, creative, collaborative, funny, cohesive....."
5,Best of the Year!,"The subtitle tells the story: Practical Improvisational theatre Techniques to Enhance Creativity, Teamwork, Leadership and Learning. Well it almost tells it all. This book teaches you in a very readable way about the concepts of improv, which is very interesting and a great read. THEN it provides you with 50 exercises that you can use immediately or tailor for your needs in training on almost any possible training topic. The best training book of the year."
3,Not what I expected,The album that came was not in great shape. It is apparently well used and the seller wrote on the jacket and on the label of the album.
4,"Simple, Satisfactory","Our family goes camping about once a month and we found we were going through a lot of those little Coleman propane canisters between our stove and lantern. We have a big propane grill at the house so it seemed logical to use that same bulk canister to power our camping appliances. Very simple to use. My only complaint would be the length. If it was another 24"" taller it would get the lantern up higher to illuminate more of the campsite. Otherwise, works as advertised."
1,You don't want this,I purchased two of these for use in a Boy Scout Troop. I couldn't believe how shaky they were when I first set them up - there is literally no support for the tree except where the bases rests against the tank. Probably the third time we used them we had one set up near some tables the Scouts were sitting at when one of the boys swung around and hit the tube with his arm - not terribly hard either. The plastic knob at the bottom sheared off and a jet of propane shot out six feet before the tank's cutoff engaged. I have thrown both these hazards away and would never recommend them to anyone. OSHA would have a fit if they knew abut this product's safety problem.
1,Broke on second use,"I love the concept. I have a propane lantern and stove, and have been using a 20 lb propane tank for a while just for the stove. The idea of mounting my lantern on a pole and running my stove from the same supply was appealing. Unfortunately, on the second camp out, the plastic nut that attaches the tree to the bottle disintegrated. It pretty much shattered, and started leaking propane rapidly. Also unfortunately, I bought it from a discount outlet store and can't return it. I have used trees with my son's boy scout troop that are entirely metal, and perform very well. I will be looking for one of those. Please avoid this piece of junk."
2,Item is NOT as pictured!,"The photo and description are for the one piece 30"" distribution tree with all metal adjustment knobs.What you get when you order is the two piece tree with a big plastic knob for connecting to the propane tank.I am not happy with the switch but have no time to get what I wanted before our big camp out. Since it is a Coleman, I will try it and update this review after this weekend. I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
2,Practice Problems,"I it is a new book. It does not look like he finished working on it before it went to press. Many chapters have a blank page with the words 'There are no proctice problems corresponding with Ch. 2 ..."". I have not had the time to go through it all, but I have found quite a few errors. For example Ch 61 Practice Problem #1 the correct answer is 78.23 km He forgets to multiply by 2 for the correct distance. The formula is d = sqr(17h) he aproximates this and uses d = 4.1 sqr(h) which is fine but he does not use the formula correctly.The book will be much better after the he corrects the many errors."
3,Rich in metaphors,"This is only the second book in the Ken Blanchard series that I have read. However in Ken Fishers book ""The only three questions that count he says on page 360 "" Jim Michaels, then Editor of Forbes and generally the dean of American business journalists, taught me that a column was supposed to be three things - entertaining, educating and profitable. Those are pretty good goals for much of life"" I think ""Your Leadership Legacy"" lacked those three qualities. But the book is rich with metaphors - especially the advise given by the character Adoi on page 13 "" What do you notice about the soil and light? Go ahead, touch it. I promise you it is not poisonous."" Unfortunately I'm a little too old for that.......I know I know ""You're never too old""........but..........."
4,Mezase Pokemon Masutaa !,"This CD had a few things, not much. There was Mezase Pokemon Masutaa and it's karaoke version and the Japanese Pokérap and that's about it."
5,Excellent,"I live in one of the area's where these beautiful rocks are and it was wonderful to be able to read about the writtings and what they meant. I am ""hooked"" on Petroglyphs."
2,Wall Plug Sold Separately,"Just a warning to other aquarists who may be interested in purchasing this blue light for moonlight in your aquarium. It is not a piece that can be purchased on its own, you must buy the adapter plug to actually be able to power the light. Mine is sitting in its box until I buy A SEPARATE PIECE that serves ONLY as a wall plug. No where on the product description does it tell you that. Now I have to decide whether to spend another ten dollars on a plug, or return the light and get something else that I can actually use."
4,cool lights put into 12 gal fluvial edge,cool lights put into 12 gal fluvial edge cut holds in platform and have lights shiny up very cool at night
4,Buyer beware. Do not order unless you have a 6 VDC transformer,"Unlike the picture used in the description the packaging my daughter's light came in has 2 large yellow labels indicating ""Transformer not included"". Had I known that I never would have purchased this product. What good is a light with a six foot cord and nothing to plug it in to? First time I've ever been burned by Amazon, although I blame Hagen for forgetting to add this tiny detail to their product description.Update:I contacted Hagen to get the part number for the transformer and they sent me one at no cost. Can't say enough about their customer service. Now that we can use the light it works fairly well for what it is. It is a small LED light for a small tank. Suction cup holds the light in place well."
1,DOESNT HAVE PLUG IN!,"You need to buy some other kind of attachment before it will work. I was very disappointed because when it says ""comes with 6 ft cord!!"" You NEED TO HAVE A FRICKIN PLUG! Not something that goes with something else unless STATED."
1,Awful singing ruins good guitar playing,"Awful singing ruins good guitar playing. Don't let the album cover fool you into thinking that this is solo guitar. No stars for the singing, one star for what's left of the guitar playing."
2,disappointed,"The book did not have the CD included. I can look up pictures online, but the CD is necessary to learn sounds and to recognize birds by ear."
5,Peppermint Oil,I bought this product after I was told it deters mice. I sprayed some on the rug and near areas were mice were seen and I haven't seen any since. It also smells great and the scent lasts for a long time.
3,Made the house smell great but did not keep the mice away!,I put cotton balls soaking with the peppermint oil all around the house where we had seen mice but they just pushed the cotton balls out of the way and came in. We caught them the old fashioined way with traps. :(
3,poor customer service,"I hate it when you buy something and try to contact the company, only to have them TOTALLY ignore your requests.BUT, Yahoo did come through and correct the problem.I would recommend this product but not the vendor"
2,Peppermint Oil,"I purchase the PEPPERMINT OIL for the sole purpose of getting rid of Mice. It smells nice, but do no work. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I placed it in a burner, I put some in a spray bottle mixed with water, I placed it on cotton balls and placed them all around where I saw droppings. Nothing works, so don't believe the story that it works. It does not work. Also quite costly to burn, and mop floors and place on cotton balls, just to get good smell in your home . I have tried everything. These mice will not eat the food, will not touch the glue traps, will not touch the old fashion traps. They appear to be smarter than the people who make the food and the traps for them. Nothing works. They will destroy the toilet paper, but will not eat any brand of mice food we put down for them."
5,Love this wonderful book!,I have served as the Executive Director of Sharing Down Syndrome for over 20 years. ([...]) How Thankful I am for this wonderful book that continues to lift my heart and give me vision. Thank you!
5,A Chicago favorite,"In the days before mail-order, Frango mints were one of the highlights of my family's trips to Chicago -- right behind sitting into the bleacher seats at Wrigley Field.We would buy a box to take home, and even though we could have eaten the whole thing in a day, we would ration the little candies to make the box last as long as possible because we knew it would be a long time before we got any more.My Christmas shopping is done for the year."
4,Frango Mint Chocolates,Light and fluffy with a clean aftertaste. The chocolate is smooth and not too sweet. The mint is pleasant and not overpowering.
4,Sharp and well made,"Fiskars never disappoints. These scissors cut smoothly and easily. My only negative comment is the size of the handles. I have large hands and no scissors ever seem to be quite comfy. These are about as big as they come, but someday someone will make handles even larger....I hope."
3,Nice Swing Arm,The lamp is nice and very easy to assemble. I'm not crazy about the lampshade and will be replacing it soon. The shade is cleverly designed for shipping as it lays flat. However it is made of fabric with a high sheen and I would prefer a non fabric shade.
5,What Year?,This is a great weekly monthly day minder. But no sellers seem to specify what year they are selling! Is it for 2007? 2008? Please let the customers know when advertising. I need it for the current year (2007).Thank youAlinaalinkan@yahoo.com
4,"Not what I was looking for, but worth reading all the same.","It is awkward to write a review for a book when it turns out that it was not the book that you had hoped to find.I bought this book while in Rome and standing in a museum bookshop and looking for a history of the city itself. I was hoping for something a little bit more likeNature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West. I had asked for that at the book store, and they had pointed me to this book.What it actually is is a one volume history of the Roman Empire. An ambitious task, and I have to say that Grant did it reasonably well. Perhaps as well as can be expected. It was dry in places, overly-detailed in places, maddeningly brief in still other places. This is the hazard of condensing such a long bit of history down to 359 pages, I expect.Recommended if what it is happens to be what you are looking for. :) Anyone got a recommendation for a history of Rome as city?"
3,"Dry, and it only skims the surface!","Length:: 1:18 MinsMy video review is not in depth, but rather a cautionary tale for those who don't want to get stuck with a dry book that lacks the detail and passion of the era."
5,find a used copy and enjoy a good read,"With some persistence, I found a used copy of this volume. I am new to the Roman History field, and this book provided a much needed overview. Scholarly and well written, Grant's book provides a strong but workable entry into a fascinating and intriquing field. At times, he moves quickly through the various stages, and I found myself wanting more information, but the design of the book was to provide an overview. After reading this work, a student can move on to more advanced reading with some degree of confidence. Don't let the price put you off. Look at the used additions."
4,Jim Messina leaves but Poco continues on,"This album from Poco is as are they all underrated by the great unwashed. Fabulous songs, harmonies and instrumentation. Highlights include the emergence of other song writers in the band apart from Richie Furay. Bad Weather by Paul Cotton is one of their finest ever tracks although Ol` Forgiver is not. Tim Schmit contributes his first song here with the title track, which is a stilted piece with lovely lyrics. Two songs on the album which show Poco at their absolute finest are Just for me and you, which is a feel good sing along highlight as is You are the One, (better live on The Forgotten Trail) An essential album for Poco fans."
3,Song List for LP,PocoFrom The Inside1. Hoe Down2. Bad Weather3. What Am I Gonna Do4. You Are The One5. Railroad Days6. From The Inside7. Do You Feel It Too8. Ol' Forgiver9. What If I Should Say I Love You10. Just For Me And You
5,This is as good as it gets!,"If you're a Poco fan, this record is a must. If you're new to Poco, this record will steal your heart. This is as good as it gets! Made at the height of their touring days, the record combines the sweetest ballads with the hardest rocking songs Poco ever performed. ""Bad Weather"", ""Railroad Days"", and ""What if I Should Say I Love You"" are my favorites."
5,Dangerously Accurate,"I am about as much of a GenXer as can possibly be being born in 1970. For my entire life I saw a great deal of things as ""off key"", such as the broken homes, the druggies, and being mistreated by many of the Boomers in the workplace. This book proved to me that it was not just my little world, but an actual issue. Bruce disarms the sterotypes of GenXers extremely well. This is a must read for anyone, Xer or Boomer, to successfully manage the most driven and innovative generation in American history."
4,Great Reference Book,"Maximizing Outlook 2000 is a great reference book that covers the broad spectrum of Outlook functionality. From basic navigation to advanced programming, this book provides detail and insights that greatly enhance the usability of the Outlook application. The book is interlaced with tips, notes and cautions, clearly identified with graphical icons, that provide the reader with the author's commentary and evaluation of Outlooks' features. The book goes beyond other Outlook reference books by providing an in-depth review of the automation capabilities supported by Outlook such as VBA macros and forms and templates. Though this book could benefit any Outlook user, my recommendation would be for power users and IT personnel who are looking to maximize the potential efficiencies that can be gained through their implementations of Outlook 2000."
4,Maximizing Outlook 2000,"Finally, the information I needed on Outlook 2000. The book was especially helpful on understanding the differences on Corporate/Workgroup and Internet only setup. Learning the specifics of these modes was essential in setting up Outlook on a LAN/WAN. Scheduling meetings and attendees availability is greatly enhanced by using Chapter 11. This has proved very beneficial as a replacement for paper memos to schedule meetings."
5,Optimize and RULE!,"Our everyday computer work, either for business or just for personal use, relays on great applications which help a lot. But, in order for an application to satisfy all the users demands, it has to be complex (not to say huge). So it is sometimes difficult to catch all its fine tunes, things that make you accomplish your tasks more efficiently and, why not, more rapidly. In this point of our discuttions we must take a closer look to Barry Simon's book, 'Maximizing Outlook 2000: The Practical Guide to Optimizing Outlook'. The title is self-explanatory: it helps us to achieve that level of work with Outlook, when we can say we are PRODUCTIVE. Better yet, the book helps us to understand the philosophy of the product, so further development of the program will be extremly easy to master. It is an excellent book, a book that I, personally, reccommend for all the people dealing with Outlook."
4,"Good overview, amazing details","This book is impressive right out of the chute. At nearly 700 pages, it provides both a detailed overview of Outlook 2000 and significant insight into details of programming Outlook to customize it to the way that you work.While for me the absence of Exchange specifics is disappointing, the material that is in the book is accurate, thorough, and understandable. This is certainly the best book on Outlook I've read and makes a great companion to Outlook Annoyances."
3,Good Outlook Reference Book,"I have used a number of books on Outlook, and this one is at the top of this list. It really does a great job of describing how to best use the program. I recommend it for anyone."
3,straightforward and easy to access the content,"I wish there were more coverage of the nitty gritty details regarding forms and how to move forms form one computer to another, but overall accessing information is very easy and intuitive. This is the best book on Outlook 2000 that i have found to date."
5,He's like the best wine... he gets better with time!!,"Wow, Gerald is truly a classic when it comes to jazz! I'm once again blown away by the captivating rhythms in his music. ""Do I DO"" had me snapping my finger's then the sweet sounds of ""Sweet Rain"" calmed my soul. What an awesome spirit I feel when I listen... It's definately one for a classic favorite in my cd case!! I thought he'd done it with ""Love Letters"" but he's surpassed that. Have you heard ""Valdez in the Country"" yet? You need to get that classis as well! The man is bad!!"
2,Much Adfo About You,"I have read several of this author's previous works, so I decided to ignore the review that was disappointed because this book seemed much more of an introduction of all the characters in this sister series. That reviewer was right on. While I like the James style of having her two main characters be part of a group dynamic, in this book, they become lost in the sheer number of other characters involved. At the end of this book I really couln't recall anything special about Tess and Lucius that made me care that they loved each other. In fact, I keep wondering how it was possible. I am interested in the stories of several of the other characters, so I will probably buy other books in this series, but this book was definitely a waste of time."
3,Disappointing effort from the Queen of this genre,"Although Eloisa James has cast every other Regency romance author since Georgette Heyer well into the shade, with her lively prose and excellent character development, as well as her multi-faceted and many layered, finely nuanced stories, this book was a dud. I enjoyed the beginning and the end, but the entire middle was weird: oddly developed scenes, disjointed dialogue, mysterious motivations, just a mess. I'd like a re-write, please, because I thought the setting and the characters were very interesting, and I'm looking forward to reading more about them, but Imogen in particular just didn't make sense in this book, at all."
4,Essex Sisters1,"Well written and very enjoyable. The sisters are vivid, and there is plenty going on in the plot. Not much for character development, but also no ridiculous angst pretending to be character development."
4,Much ado about you,I really enjoy this author and her books. I like how she intertwines characters from one book to the other. Reading the Essex sister books was very entertaining. They got me hooked to this author. Thanks Eloisa James for your fun and witty stories with just the right amount of eroticism.
5,I absolutely loved this book,I found the story most enjoyable and think the author did a good job in outlining her new series. I adored the H and the way he went about getting the h. The h is definitely the best of the sisters. This is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it.
4,liked it....,This book was interesting... I defineately liked it. It certainly had a feel of little women to me. Four sisters trapped in an age where there aren't many possibilities to better themselves. They seemed loyal and loving toward one another. I liked the female bonds established and it really adds to the book.
2,Hmm -- not really sure if this is an art book.,"I'm a bit upset about this book.1) There aren't a lot of pictures of Kandinsky's work or examples.2) The commentary (text) is rather inane and really doesn't make for a good read.Bad coffee book, bad read.Go find something else."
3,NO NEED TO BE RELEASED,"I feel this collection, supposedly a greatest hits collection, is not even close to being complete. Actually, there was a previous Grass Roots greatest hits collection released in 1996 that contained much more material. It included some minor hits along with the major ones. If you already have that collection, this one would be a waste of money. If you don't have that one, then it would be preferable to purchase the aforementioned 1996 collection or the two-disc Rhino collection. Both are a better value."
1,Really BAD remix!,"...The opening vocal travels from one channel to the other with a noticeable echo and fades out just before ""two, three, four"" and the chorus. The sound is overly bright and distracting. Sounds really weird to someone who owned their LP 30 years ago."
3,There was some back round noise but ok for use in the car:,"as above, there was some back round noise : in remastering but its ok for use in the car. If you have a good cd player with good speakers you will be disapointed:"
4,Not quite the Team Rocket single but still a heck of a CD,"The best Japanese CD I own by far is the one titled Rocket Troop, but this one didn't dissappoint me at all. The first two songs I could listen to all day-I don't have a clue who it's supposed to be singing them, but they have awesome beats. The third one is Meowth singing and Pikchu repeating his name-really cute. The fourth and fifth ones are not as good but still enjoyable. Do I recommend it? Yessiree!"
5,This is one fine novel,"After the Rain is a splendid novel which I would not classify as women's fiction or romance. It is simply a great story, well crafted and with fine and believable characters. Karen White knows how to set and tell a Southern story and her sentences and dialogue flow like sweet tea for which the area is so famous. You must real other reviews to get an outline of the plot as i am more concerned with character development, story movement, and satisfactory conclusion. These are the things White does so well along with her ability to ""turn a phrase"". For example, ""A strong breeze gathered the loose raindrops and the giant magnolia's leaves and shook them together in a gentle applause."" That, dear reader, is true creative writing. A most enjoyable book, highly recommended for your reading pleasure."
3,After the Rain,It's o.k. Not the best book I've ever read or Karen White's better one.. It's just not grabbing me. The story line seems familiar.
4,After the rain,I really enjoyed this updated story like the updated Falling Home. Karen Whiter is one of my favorite southern writers and I have read every one of her books. I really like the ones about Charleston. So glad they are on Kindle as well as paperback.
4,Loved the story.,The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was as I went from one page to the next I lost a line or two of the story. This didn't happen all the time but enough to be irritating.
4,Not as good as her current releases,"Karen White is one of my most favorite authors so I feel a bit disloyal to say this was just ok. Perhaps it would be kinder to say a reader could tell this was an earlier story and even though reworked it lacks the depth of her books now. But it is worth reading and a good sequel. I would not ever miss one of Karen's books, she is that good at story telling."
3,After the Rain,It was a nice story . Very family involved with teenage problem and sibling problems. I thought the photography angle was interesting and added another demention to the story.
5,Lovely story.,"Once again, Karen White has written a different and unique story that holds your attention from beginning to end. It's so easy to identify with her characters and to understand their feeling. Nice job, Ms. White!"
3,One of Karen Whites First Romances,This book which was written in 2003 is a Romance and nothing like her current novels. I found a few inconsistences in the plot and the formatting for Kindle is terrible. Given all that this book is not bad considering the price.
3,Those Called As Watchman Intercessors!,"Since 1997 I have been getting up for the fourth watch (3am) intercessory prayer. Perry Stone does a very good job of explaining the scriptures and the relevance of the three o'clock in the morning prayer watch. I did not agree with all of the ""other"" stuff, but he did a good job of explaining the significance of the three o'clock in the morning watch prayer.Simple TruthSimple Truth Too: Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star"
3,She's Tough,"This is a very good DVD and Jillian pushes you, however I can't get to the workout without going though the commercials and the intro. after watching it over and over we start the DVD and do something else for the 10 minutes of intro and come back when the menu comes up on the TV to begin the workout."
4,Almost perfect,"I've been using 30-Day Shred now for about 3 weeks, finally able to do work out #3 a couple times a week. My body has definitely changed . It does work. However, It drives me crazy that I have to listen and watch all the intro babble. The dvd will not allow me to skip to menu, so I can just pick my work out and get started. It's a small thing, but when I get ready to work out , I have no patience to wait for all the instructions to finish (yet again). That's the reason for the four stars and not five."
5,Great Exercise Video,Jullian Michaels really knows her stuff. Having different levels ensures that workouts are designed to fit everyone's fitness needs. The exercises tone your body and they really work you hard. I will buy her other videos.
2,Descent Workout...,"Difficult but I'm sure you would see results if you did this every day. I get frustrated with the constant up and down from laying on the ground to standing, that is my biggest complaint with this workout. Lots of jumping jacks in this one too."
3,not too hard,"Good way to sweat. Only 20 mintues, but if you're looking for a quick fix to lose a bit of weight real quick this isn't going to do that. I watched my diet, and did this every day, for a few weeks-i've only had it that long- but didn't lose weight (but i didn't gain either). Since i'm a stay at home mother i don't leave much, so if you're not very active this won't cut it. BUT it is a great exercise and it's not too hard. I'd rather just run a mile or something, i feel that i get more accomplished doing that."
5,EXCELLANT if you want results!,"After spending all this money on a treadmill and then an exersize bike with very little results... how funny this $15 would be the best money I have ever spent!Work outs are not easy... they are not easy on the knees.... but YOU WILL GET RESULTS. The first three days are hard and you will be sore, work thru it.I have been doing it for about three weeks now... gradually moving up (have missed some days) but I have lost 16 lbs! And my partner has lost 13lbs! And Jillian Micheals seems to have a sense when you feel like taking a break... it feels like she is directly talking to YOU.THIS WORKS!"
4,This works if you do it!,"I tried this because I liked the fact that it was short-its only 20 mins or so. This workout is simple and the moves are easy. No complicated dance moves or routine, just straight forward steps. However, be advised that this workout is tough and makes you sweat! If you want something that's uncomplicated and simple, yet effective, then this is the workout for you!"
5,OMG what a great workout!,"I'm not much of an avid exerciser and when I normally do a workout video it seems like I'm just starting to sweat a little by the time it ends. After doing the 20 minute level one workout on this dvd I was sweating buckets! I hate to sweat but it felt great- like I was finally doing something right! I have all the confidence in the world that this is what it takes (along with sensible eating) to lose weight. Jillian is a tough cookie on the Biggest Loser but she's also (in my opinion) the best personal trainer out there! I can feel body parts I didn't know I had right now! I highly recommend this dvd! Even for beginners like me (did I mention how infrequently I exercise? Bad I know!) who may have to do the modified moves, can get one heck of a work out! All I can say is buy it! Don't even think twice!!! This is one program that I will definitely stick with!!!"
5,Jillian is a Beast,"This is exactly the workout I've been looking for. I work out on a regular basis, but this is a video that will really rev you up and get your body in great shape fast. I've been doing the workout for almost 30 days and have defintely lost pounds and inches. This is not a workout for the weak; you have to decide you are going to do it and then get it done. Due to the 20-25 minute workouts, I can do this every day and fit it in my lifestyle and it works. I feel empty if I don't work out with Jillian every day now. The DVD is changing my life. I have more confidence in what I can accomplish and finally a workout that pushes me to new heights."
2,Bootleg,I was excited to get this video at a cheap price... but you get what you pay for. This is a bootleg and the cover was printed on a desktop computer. But I was willing to deal with it if it worked... but it doesn't. It will be playing normally but then go in slow motion for about 20-30 seconds and then return back to normal. It does this throughout the entire workout.
2,Wrong Order and Unbalanced,"This DVD was a disappointment to me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the first segment was the better one, however, I could not imagine doing the same segment over and over for days or weeks, because she doesn't cover all the muscle groups. In fact, even if you do all 3, you don't get a balanced workout. I don't recall a single tricep exercise anywhere.The order of weights, cardio, then core bothered me the most. Basically, after each cardio burst you are supposed to lie down flat with your heart rate way up high - what the heck? I don't think Jillian is very knowledgeable when it comes to fitness and her personality and DVDs reflect that."
1,30 Day Shred,"I purchased this product because it was advertised as ""new."" When I received it in the mail, it was very obviously a burned copy of the Jillian Michaels CD. I love the workout program, but I will never purchase anything from this provider again."
1,jb,"I have exercised regularly for 30 years, and I have never worked so hard as I did in Jillians 20 minutes. I started to notice my body changing after week 3. My only problem I injured my knee on day 10, but continued to modify the moves. Tonight I sit here with my leg iced and elevated after having knee surgery. So even with all her comments about being careful with your knees I still got injured. But I am going to get right back at this DVD when my knee heals."
5,OMG!,"If your on a time crunch this video will kick your %$#@*!!!!! Love it love it love it, I recommend it to everyone I know. It saved me from being suck in my usual workouts. A MUST TRY!"
3,Love/Hate relationship with this DVD.,"This DVD is a good workout, you'll work up a great sweat. But it's not for those with knee or hip problems. It's a lot of lunging and jumping so if those things bother you then I wouldn't suggest your purchase this DVD. Jillian isn't big on stressing proper form on some of the moves either.There are lots of old gym class moves like squat thrusts, jumping jacks, and bicycle crunches. The 3 levels are challenging and you'll feel stronger by the end. I'd recommend doing each level until you've mastered it, even if it takes longer than 30 days to finish all 3 levels because moving to the next level before you're ready will probably lead to injury or burn out.The warmup and stretching for the vids are pretty weak."
1,Terrible,"Jillian Michaels prides herself on being the toughest trainer on ""The Biggest Loser."" That might be true, but I'm not sure that's something to brag about. She seems to be overcompensating for something--her style is bullying, gruff, crass, and insulting. Maybe some people are motivated by that kind of attitude (seeing how many five-star reviews this has....*scratches head*), but I'm not. Her training style makes me want to sit on my couch, eat a cheeseburger, and watch ""Newhart."" I've been active and fit all my life, but I don't respond well to condescension. If this works for you, fine. I prefer trainers who are warm and encouraging (though demanding), like Jennifer Kries and Violet Zaki. I'm selling 30 day shred. It's a waste of time and money."
3,30 DAY SHRED,Product is not as challenging as Michaels' NO MORE TROUBLE ZONES but it still serves its purpose of burning calories/fat.
3,Too much talking - not enough working out! Long winded!,"I am disapointed with this! I really liked Jillian and thought I'd love her DVD but I have to be honest, she does more talking than she does working out!The workout is a good one but it takes forever to get past the previews and her talking about her step program before you even get to the workout! Then once you get to the workout she talks some more before showing you the two ladies behind her who you need to watch. And yes, since she is mostly talking and not working out you do need to watch THEM and not her!Needless to say an overall disapointment. I purchased this in hopes of working out each morning with it before work. I can't spend the what feels like 10 minutes each morning to get to the work out that it takes! Thumbs down for me just for that reason.If you could skip the intro and her talking and get straight to the workout it would be 100% better! The actual workout itself is a good one."
3,"Good workout, wish Jillian would watch her language","I agree with those that say this is a good workout. It certainly challenges you. What you might also find challenging is keeping your children's ears covered while she uses words like ""ass"" and ""bad ass"". I have to work out at home due to having little ones and time constraints. I prefer a workout that does not include language like this. I highly recommend Jari Love, especially her newest Ripped 1000 DVD. Awesome workout and no cussing.Jari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000"
5,lesliev,I have been searching for workouts for a long time looking for a real challenge that will not get boring after a few uses. This is the one. I Love this workout and its only 20 minutes. Its a tough workout but good for those who like to feel it afterwards. The best part of it is thats its only 20 minutes so that motivates you to hang in there. The 20 minutes go by so fast. I have been using this for 3 weeks and am on level 2 which is a bit harder. This week i will try level 3.I recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a challenge.
4,Good Workout,This tape really does give you a good workout. The only downside is that it is pretty annoying that you have to listen to Jillian's intro every time - I wish you could fast forward to the actual workout.
3,Not really impressed with it.,"Again, I was not really impressed with it. It seems to me that Jillian is more into telling someone what to do than do it herself, too. That was a turn off for me. However, on the other hand, many have lost weight under her direction. For the money, it does the job."
3,bit boring,"I thought I purchased this after some of good reviews, but on week 2, I was bored already and only lost 3 lbs. I admitted that Jillian did kick your butt, but again it didn't make me to motivate to keep continuing her workout DVD.So, I am moving on to the other DVD workout such as kettlebell workout perhaps."
2,Need some Ibe from Harm's,"Twas the Jillian Michaels workout disc #2 that killed my back. It hurt last week after I did it, but this time it has killed it dead. A massage would be ever so nice."
4,Good but may cause injuries!,"This is for anyone who isnt very active or is just starting to work out again.I am not active & im trying to loose weight. I did Level 1 on OnDemand. I felt it, i was sweating like crazy, did i mention i FELT it? I did level 1' three days in a row because i enjoyed it. BUT after only 3 days of exercising i sprained my wrist badly..i dont know if it was because of the ""Up & Down"" movement, the push-ups(which i HATE lol), the weights, or even just ME! I had to stop working out for a week because of the sprain. So after all that I am still going to buy the DVD because it made me sweat & my muscles soar, & to me that means its working!"
3,Ouch,"I've had this dvd for a long time now but avoided using it, mostly because it is INTENSE and because it hurts my knees. Yes it works in the sense that your muscles will feel sore the next day and be like that for days. I've never had bad knees and I'm in my 20s and 110 lbs but all the jumping up and down from the floor doesn't feel right for my knees. I wore proper sports shoes and tried to keep form, but it felt like something popped out of place and didn't go back to normal for a while. I think I'll stick to cycling from now on..."
5,great tape!,great tape for those who have little time in their lives to work out...I started this tape 2 weeks ago and so far the result are there. I can't wait to see my results after a couple of months!!
5,Excellent,"I got the video in a week after I bought it. I decided to buy this product because my friend recommended and she said that I could buy it through Amazon, and will be shipper. I started the program and I think it is working. I definitely recommend it!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I've recently lost weight through an hcg program, and wanted to tone up. This workout has been AMAZING! I was worried about being able to wake up 30 minutes early (To get dressed and do the workout). But within a few days of working out, not only were my arms more toned, but my body clock was set! Even when I took a few weeks off, I would wake up at the same time. My stamina and endurance for other exercising increased. Everything was just plain better!Excellent program! I'm getting the Burn Fat Boost Metabolism workout next!!"
3,DVD is made in a faulty way,"I cannot stop the DVD and pick up on the next workout. I have to watch from the beginning every time. It's a good exercise, quick and effective, but I don't have the time to wait for it to run through before I am able to choose a workout."
5,Slimming with 30 day Shred,I do this workout 4 days a week and play softball on Sundays and have lost 9 lbs total. it is difficult when you get to level 3 with weights but the payoff is showing. People see it and that is so awesome. Highly recommended as it was to me.
3,"Good Workout, but too hard on my body","I never had knee issues before doing this workout. I had chronic knee pain until I stopped doing this workout and went back to the gym for swimming and the elliptical. Eventually the knee pain went away, but it took a long time. Her warm up and cool down stretching are not enough. I always had to do additional stretching otherwise I would be too sore the next day."
4,Great morning exercise routine,This is one exercise video that you CAN fit in. I find it challenging and do feel some results. Look forward to continung the different levels to ramp it up
4,Great work out,I really love her workouts as I always feel the burn. She is motivating with all of her disks that she offeres.
3,Ehhh...not a fan,I normally love workout videos. but this one isn't very organized. As in she doesn't do the same things on the right side as the left...there isn't any counting aloud that lets you know your getting the same workout in your right arm & your left. Its not a bad video at all. I just didn't like it.
4,Intense,"A very intense workout. Not for the faint of heart. It is worth it, if you want that extra push. Would recommend to anyone who is serious about losing weight."
5,Physical Education Teacher,I think that this video is a great cardio and strength work-out. My students love working out to it.
2,Would NOT play!!!,The video played for about ten seconds and stopped. i Could not ever get the video to continue to play.
3,oki worth the 6 dollars,Hi I am an intermediate when it comes to aerobics this is an oki DVD I was able to follow along some modifications needed not a big deal. Jillian is irritating to listen to after a while when you get the routine down you may want to turn up your tunes! She does not cu at all so beginners I advise watching it first and try not to get discouraged.
5,excellent,I really enjoy working out with Jullian. I can see a difference in with my body right away.
4,"Good Workout, but tough","This is really a great workout and it's short! I'm overweight and I'm struggling, but you just modify the workout or slow it down to the point that you can do the move. I don't always keep up with the pace, but I make myself do the workout as best I can. I'm on the second week and have moved to Level 2. Probably will be there for about a month as it's really tough. Keep it up and you will be in shape! It's your workout and if you want to lose weight and get into shape, this is the one."
4,Get Shredded!,"So far this has been a great workout! I've been doing it for 6 days straight and I can already feel the results. I love that there is a modified version for several parts of the workout which gives you something to work up to. It is definitely a tough workout, but it never gets so hard that I feel out of my league. I have only done the Level 1 workout, but for 25min a day this is pretty great."
4,What a workout,To be 20 minutes Jillian really allow us to work up a sweat. I appreciate three different workouts. I had my product for 30 days but I just started my 30 day challenge three days ago. I recommend this video but advise the owner not to slack off.
4,Ok workout,"I bought this after reading a few (all positive) reviews and I figured I would give it a try. It is a good workout, but after a few days working out I noticed my left knee was hurting, I figured it had something to do with my knee injury suffered years ago. I went on and then both my knees were hurting, as well as my hands.Like I said, it is a good workout but not a daily one for me, I will use Fitness Coach and jogging along with this."
5,Sweaty buckets,I had recieved my copy of 30 Day Shred yesterday and tried it last night. I was sweating like crazy in the middle of it. I wanted to give up but Jillain kept me going. I am going to use it for 30 days and see what results I will get. Totally worth the money and time.
4,Great workout!,"I just started the 30-day shred (doing workout 1), and was definately sore the first day. This is a great workout. There's a great variety of excercises, and the best part is that they're simple. She shows a great way to attack lower abs on crunches too. Great video, worth the price."
5,Great workout!!!!!,I've been athletic and in shape for my whole life. I have recently been slacking and needed something to get me back in to the routine and motivated. For a little more than 20 minutes I get a great workout. I really don't need to lose weight but would like to tone up before summer;). It leaves me with a good amount of soreness. I also wear my HRM and my heart rate is up there the whole time!!! Great DVD and workout for anyone who has a busy schedule! Highly recommended!
3,ouch...my knees,"I give so much props and credit to Jillian Michaels, she's amazing. The only thing with this workout is that after doing it 2 weeks to a month my knees starting hurting so bad. I had read reviews before I bought this about other people saying their knees would hurt after a while but I thought I would try it anyway, everyone has a different pain tolerance. Once I stopped using this workout about a week or two later my knees stopped hurting. I love the workout, it's great I just wish it didn't make my knees hurt."
4,Time well spent!,"I enjoyed Jillian's video. She works you very hard in a short amount of time, but it is much easier to find 20 minutes out of your day to work out than it is an hour."
4,tough workout,"if you are honest and give it all you got, it will shred the inches away. give it a try."
4,great workout,great dvd but do not push yourself too hard. My knees hurt when I upped the intensity. But an awesome workout.
4,kicks your butt,"Some people may find this workout video tedious, with its emphasis on jumping jacks, push ups, and sit ups, but it works. I've never had any other excercise get my heart rate up as much and there are definately quick results. There are three different twenty minute workouts that are increasingly difficult. I would recomend it, especially to those who are having trouble getting results from other workouts."
5,It works!,"I am a full time working mom of two kids (2 and 7 months) so I have zero free time, and was carrying around about 20 extra pounds. I found this DVD searching for a Zumba video and decided to try it out given all the reviews.The first day I couldn't even finish level 1. But my husband and I kept at it. We didn't do every day (both of us were plauged with injuries..wear sneakers and use a mat!) but after a month I lost 13lbs and my husband lost 10. We are both stronger, more toned, and have baggy clothes. We have only done levels 1 and 2. I just bought Ripped in 30 which is pretty similar to relieve boredom.I never thought I would do this, but I preach the gospel of Jillian. If you are busy but want to get fit, get this video and stick with it. 25 minutes a day DOES work! Jillian is a genius!"
5,Excellent for getting started.,"If your are looking to buy this DVD, I'm assuming you are like me and a bit out of shape. I hadn't worked out for almost 4 years and have had two children in this time. So you can imagine I was pretty out of the work-out loop. This is a great video to get you back on track, it's not overly difficult and within a few weeks one can get in the grove of it. So that you don't get bored, you can move up to the other levels when you are ready for a change - they offer modified movements for beginners at each level. Best of luck to you!"
4,"This is a kick ""a"" video","I bought this video over a year ago and I really LOVE it! It is short, perfect for when I don't have much time to work out but it totally packs it in to a short period of time. I have other Jillian videos but so far I like this one best. There are things I like from each level so I like being able to change it up. Mainly I feel that I have worked out after this video and I like that feeling."
5,Great video!,"I am 5'7'', and 135 lbs. I mainly just wanted to tone up and lose about 10 pounds that I had gained from surgery. This helped me get into shape. At first the workouts were kinda difficult but I built my stamina. I liked the 3-2-1 approached and how she always kept you moving. I really felt like I got a workout after doing these, which is essential when it comes to a workout DVD."
2,Too Long of An Intro,"It takes way too long from when you put in the DVD until the work out starts. There must be 10 minutes of 'commercials' in the beginning! The DVD does not let you fast forward through them either. More marketing than work out. I bought a bunch of Michael's DVDs and if I could return them, I would."
5,"You will hurt, and you will like it!","I am a workout DVD junkie and this DVD is my favorite go to workout. When I am short on time, but I cannot skip another workout this always gets me back on track. I pop this in before work in the morning and it has me sweating breathing hard from just the warm up. 20 minutes later, it's all over and I can start my day off right. Don't let the shortness of this DVD fool you, even the easiest workout will have you sore in the morning and reaching for the ice pack. If you consistently use this DVD, 30 days later you will definitely see some progress and look better naked!"
5,Shred head,"Great workout video. I work up a sweat every time, it's challenging, and I don't get bored!"
4,It feels good to exercise,This is a nice workout video. I just wish it had more ab workout as it only devotes a sixth of the main workout to abs with its 3-2-1 minute strength-cardio-ab training.
4,Wow!,"I've had this video almost a month and while I don't do it everyday I try to make time for it 2-3 days a week. It really kicks my butt, but in a good way! I've noticed a difference in my muscles already. Highly recommend."
3,"Quite the workout, but hard on the knees and wrists!","I would consider myself new to working out and to cardio especially. I have been doing mostly weight training for the last 6 months or so, and I realized I needed to do a lot more cardio if I wanted to lose more weight, so I gave this a go.Very hard for beginners or overweight people. I had to stop and rest a number of times, and this was just on level one. Haven't even made it to level 2 yet. She relies on lots of jumpy movements (jumping jacks, jump squats, etc) and by the end of the workout on day 3, my knees and wrists needed a break. Very hard on the joints unless you have a very thick mat underneath.If you don't have a problem with joints, this will certainly get you sweating!"
3,Killer Knee Workout,"This is a killer workout. I made it 10 days with level 1 and 3 days with level 2 before having to stop. My knees are killing me; I could barely walk afterwards. I Sweat like a pig and no weight loss or inch loss after 2 weeks. Will probably need a very strict diet to see any results. Jillian is very pleasant to listen to and very motivational. I believe in her workouts... just not for anyone with knee issues. If you are young, strong, can take constant pounding on the knees, then this workout will do you good. It is a challenge and a very difficult workout. But if you have any issues with high-impact workouts, or workouts that are killer on your knees, then avoid this one."
4,Great Work-out,This is a great product as long as you actually use it.The exercises are not difficult but somehow the combonation is extremely effective. I'd definately pick it up. The price is good too!
5,Excellent DVD!!,I love The Biggest Loser and I have really have began to like Jillian the past couple of seasons. She's hardcore but she knows her stuff! I began this DVD and it was VERY challenging! But after about a week I completed the entire 20 minutes of Level 1 without having to stop & catch my breath (there's 3 Levels)! It's still very challenging but you have to push yourself through this! I think maybe after another week I will try Level 2. And Jillian is motivating in this DVD more than you would imagine. 5 stars for this DVD!
5,"Great, Challenging Workout even if you're already in shape!","I love the 30 Day Shred! I was already in good basic shape from doing Tae Bo, but the 30 Day Shred has been a real challenge! I am now on level 3 and its still an excellent, very challenging workout. Haven't exactly lost a ton of weight on it, but perhaps that's because I didn't really have much to lose. In the past month my muscles have become more defined and MUCH stronger. My body is more buff which I just love. My pants are hanging looser, and I feel more confident when wearing a tank top. This DVD was definitely worth the money. I combine the workout daily with an hour of walking for a little extra cardio and do it 4 days a week, on off days I do Tae Bo 1-2 days a week and take 1 day off. I am feeling healthier and stronger than I have in my whole life."
4,This gets results.,"After seeing a LOT about how awesome 30 Day Shred (30DS) is on the MyFitnessPal message boards, I ordered it for myself. The results you get and the difficulty of the video are really dependent on how much work you put into it and how fit you already are. After the first two days, my abs were so sore that I couldn't sleep on my stomach. By Day 5, it gets a lot easier. My upper body is very weak, so I had a hard time with Level 2, but I did get through it. So far, I've lost almost 12 inches off of my body. I can't wait to see what's in store when I start Level 3 tonight."
5,This workout literally kicks butt!,"I'm an intermediate exerciser who was looking for a challenge and quick results. This workout nearly killed me, but in a good way. I have done it every other day for a week so far, and I already see-and feel- the results! Go Jillian!"
3,"Great work out, too much talk","The work outs are great. Too bad she talks FOREVER before you get to it. You only need to hear that the first time you go through the DVD, not every single time. There should be a track for people to skip through the talk (because the DVD won't let you skip the track). Love the work out, but I hardly ever do it because I don't want to listen to a 10 minute intro every time. Bummer."
5,Wow!,"This is a fantastic workout. The idea is 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs. Repeat 3 times. This workout kicks my butt and it is fun. Just when you think you're going to die your time is up and you move on. I'm using this and Jillian's Yoga Meltdown and can already see the difference in my arms and thighs after just two weeks."
4,Liked It A Lot,"I liked this a lot.PROS: High intensity in a short period of time. Not too difficult. Jillian mixes things up.CONS: Too ""shoulder"" intensive.SO MUCH of the strength moves involve the shoulders and static shoulder exercises and that just bugged me personally, but might not bother others.I did like the workout a lot and felt like it was pretty productive. Claims that it's hard on the body or knees were not legit as far as I was concerned. Just follow the correct technique."
4,Oh my WOW!,"This actually kicked my butt! I have tried video workouts and nothing happened. I figured ""20 minutes?! Psh that's easy!"" Oh how wrong I was, the first week I tried this I was so sore, but it is great. I feel amazing and can't stop doing it. The 20 minutes fly by (I hardly notice the background music) and Jillian does a decent job in describing how the moves work and what they do for your body. Truly a great addition to any workout DVD collection"
4,"So far, so good","I just used this DVD for the first time last night. I am now sitting at work with really sore arms and legs, haha. I am 5'5 about 115lbs and just want to ""tone up"" I don't really want to lose weight..I run on and off but that gets boring so that is why I bought this DVD. I wasn't expecting it to be so intense, but it really makes me think that I am in awful shape, especially since it was only level one.I have a few concerns..is it expected that we do this workout for 30 consecutive days? She is out of her mind, I am too sore today to even think about more squats...& I wish she would have given a little extra time to explain the moves beforehand because I think that is why some people are reporting injury from this workout. It is strenuous, but if you are doing the moves properly your knee's, back, feet..etc should not be hurting you."
5,LOVE it!,I love Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred! The workout is intense and does the job. I am on level 2 right now and I can see results! Best work out dvd ever!
5,Great for beginners to advanced,This is a great video for beginners all the way up to advanced. It will be especially great for starting out or lower level workouts b/c it starts with an easy 20 minute routine and then allows you to progress to the more advanced 20 minute routines. For really advanced people you could do 2 or all 3 20 minute routines for a hard core workout. Not too hard on the joints and incorporates plenty of ab work within the workout so your not stuck trying to do abs at the end.
3,Kicked my butt but killed my knees,"It is a great work out in that you work upper body and lower body at the same time. However, my knees could not handle the stress of the workouts. I had to quit or else end up in the doctor's office."
5,"great, short, workout",great workout in a short amount of time. have only used the first level. will be good for any level of fitness.
4,I like her now!,"I can't stand how she yells and screams on tv but this is a really good workout dvd. It's basic and easily understood. She doesn't move too fast so you don't feel stupid and inept with the moves. I tend to do two of the workouts at one time just to go for a longer amount of time. Overall, while I won't watch the tv show... I'm glad I bought her dvd."
5,"Holy Crap, this is tough!","I trained with a personal trainer for over a year, so when I ordered this video and found out it was only 20 minutes, I thought it would be easy. WRONG. She gets your heart beat up right away and keeps it there. I just got the video and completed the first level. I'm considering doing the second one right away, after I have a water break. She doesn't give you any breaks! I'm still shaking a little after 5 completing the workout 10 minutes ago. I love this video, because she kicks your butt. Here's hoping I shred some weight in 30 days!"
5,Great workout,I take a class once a week that I like. This dvd is great for at home. It's easy to follow and a great workout. It's as good as going to class.
3,"Great workout, but you have to sit through 10 minutes of ads to get to the workout","I bought this because I have a 20 minute time period in the morning that I can workout. Unfortunately, this DVD has 10 minutes of ads and ""blabber"" that you cannot fast forward through or skip. It makes me really annoyed every time I put this DVD in. Great workout, extremely annoying unsolicited ""extras"" that cannot be skipped."
3,Just Get Started Already,"First of all the work outs are fun, challenging, and effective. I like the progression. The banter is a bit annoying after a few days, but I'm starting to put on my own music or something else to listen to.What sucks about this DVD is the long promotional intro videos which you cannot skip. And also the long intro to work out #1. That informational stuff should have been put on a separate segment so you don't have to listen to it every day or have to try to fast forward past it. I want to just jump into my work out, and don't want to have to wait through all the junk at the beginning of the disc.Would have given it 5 stars if the DVD had been edited and put together better."
3,OK Workout,"I like this work out for when I'm short on time or as an add on workout. One downside is I don't like how Jillian constantly stops to make pointers. It can be distracting. Some of her comments are cheesy, but the workout itself is decent. Not as tough as Cathe Friedrich's DVDs, which are still my favorite workouts---she does the entire workout with you. For 3 short 20 minute workouts though, you can't beat the price on the Shred workout."
5,Very good /hard workout,This is a very good but hard workout just on Level one still and she kicks my butt. The only thing that I would change you have to go through the beginning where she is explaining everything each morning would like to save that time and skip that. But I am sore all over. A good kinda sore that you know it is doing you some good:)
5,"Kicked my butt, LITERALLY!","This DVD has gotten me in great shape, and in less then a months time. She's very motivating, and the different levels make for a great upgrade to your workout routine. A++"
3,What's with the long intro?,"The workouts are great, but what's with the long introduction? You can't skip any of it. Every single time you start this DVD, you have to listen to her explain how the 30 Day Shred system works and, ""There are three levels of workouts. One, two and three."" You see? I've got the damn thing memorized! If there are three levels of workouts, how ELSE would they be numbered?! The set up of the DVD is all wrong. Workouts are great, but the DVD quality drives me crazy."
4,You will see a difference!!,"This was my first ever home workout video purchase. Hard at first, but by week two you can really see a difference in your body, which only makes you want to work out more!! I find myself passing up going to the gym bc I can get better results doing a 20min workout w/ Jillian than working out in the gym for 45min-1hr. Definitely worth the $8 I paid for it. Also I should mention Jillian does a great job motivating you and reminding you why you're working out in the first place. My husband is even challenged by the workouts. ""Don't phone it in!"""
5,Wife loves it,"I'm in pretty good shape, but when I did this with my wife, I was still sore for a couple days, and that was on the easy level! However, it is not set up to be hard, she just does a good job of making the 20 minutes as effective as she possibly can."
3,So much of jumpings.,"I feel great after workout, but my biggest compliant with this- she does a lot of jumping jacks and anything that has to do with jumping. I cannot do them because I live on an 2nd floor in apartment complex. I like her other exercises and I follow it but when it comes to jumping part, I will switch out and do something else on my own meanwhile they're jumping then get back on track with them when they're doing something else again.."
5,Have Questions:,Hello Everyone!!! I had a few questions for anyone...1. I am also doing Couch to 5K.. Did anyone else walk/run while doing 30 Day Shred?2. Did anyone skip days instead of doing 30 days straight? If so what was your results?
5,Short but effective,"I bought this, because I'm a new mom and need a workout that is short (I do it after my baby goes to bed). I love it! I used to run (and still do, just not as often) and would have hour plus workouts pre-baby, but I just don't have the time anymore. This seems to be just fine in keeping up my fitness and toning without taking forever. Level 1 is moderate for me, but 2 and 3 are tough! I definitely love this DVD."
3,less talk,"I am very satisfied with the content of this video. However, I still wait for the excercise video which had a portion to explain the motions but then offered a routine which skipped the small talk. For those viewing it daily, the explanantions and ""chatter"" make you want to turn down the volume."
5,Shred It Up!!!,"I bought this for my wife, as she is always looking for new workout DVDs and she LOVES it. She said it is brutal, but it is good!"
3,"Good Shred, poor production","I have only used this video for level one. I find the workout good and it seems like it can accommodate most any level. It is especially good for those wanting a place to start. One aspect of this video which I really do not like is that each time I start the video I have to go through all the ""introductions,"" which seem to take about five minutes. When I come in to work out, I want to work out--I do not need to sit through the promo materials each time. All the pressing of menu buttons, fast forward, etc., are to no avail. Please, you need to ""package"" this better."
4,Nice!,"I'm not big on work out videoes but I'm loving this one. It's quick, to the point and works! The work out is very diverse so it never get boring and you can't beat getting a total work out in only 20 minutes.I've read where some of the other commenters have had problems with their knees. I had an ACL reconstruction a few years ago on my right knee and have no problems doing any of these moves. The only pain I have is the burn from making my muscles work."
5,another dvd from Jillian? woah! prepare for painful weightloss!,"wow! another exercise dvd from Jillian! Prepare to have a painful weightloss! I bought herThe Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: The Complete Body Workout (5-Disc DVD Set: Shape Up - Front, Shape Up - Back, Cardio Kickbox, Maximize - Full Frontal, Maximize - Back in Action)and started last week. I lost 4.5 lbs. by the end of the week! She's really tough, but really encouraging because she feels the pain right along with you (and she's fit!). I definately recommend any of her dvds if you are serious about weightloss. I'm ordering this dvd and hopefully it will stop any plateauing my body attempts to do. So stop sitting here reading these reviews and buy it!!!"
3,Be careful not to over-do it!,"This workout (level 1) is by no means low-impact! So if you're like me and need to keep one foot on the ground at all times, I'd look elsewhere. The workout is great, but I have joint problems and a larger chest, so high-impact is just not for me. I was a little too gung-ho about this video the first week but then my knees started to ache severely AND I strained/tore one of my lower ab muscles, which now hurts any time I contract it (or when I cough, sneeze, or laugh)."
3,Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred (Purchased on 03/26/2011),i think she wants to kill me! lol this is one u definately want to start out easy and do what u can without pain.i never believed in no pain no gain especiall if ur older is a good video tho ^^
4,Great workout,This workout is a great starting place. It is nice because it has 3 levels that are packed with strengthing cario and ab workouts. I felt stronger and thinner after one week. I don't like that the video does not let you skip right to the main menu on startup so you have to listen to her spiel about her workouts every time you put it in.
2,You cant skip the long-winded intro! So irritating!,"These workouts are good, however, I usually only have a short window in the day to exercise and because you are unable to skip the long-winded intro, I usually just pick another workout. I also find Jillian's personality a little too aren't-I-cute-because-I'm-so-sassy to stomach."
4,Excellent video!,"This is a short workout that will kick your butt!! Anyone can do it, beginners, intermediates, or advanced. Jillian gives everyone a GREAT workout!"
5,Great workout in short amount of time,"These workouts (3 on the video) are great. You work several body parts at the same time, so even though the workouts are only 20 minutes, they are worth more like 40 minutes. The three levels let you build up to the killer moves. Highly recommend!"
4,Jillian 30 Day Shred!!,"this workout is fantastic! Saw immediate results within 2 weeks. Not really a large amount of weight loss, but I did see a significant amount of muscle gain just with me doing this dvd off and on (wasn't diligent at first.) Overall, great buy..produces good results!"
3,Too much jumping,"The workouts are definitely good. I like how there are three 30 minute workouts, however, I personally don't connect as much with Jillian as other fitness instructors on DVDs.Two things that bother me: 1. most of the cardio is high impact, and I don't think that's a good idea. 2. There is no reference to how to work this program as a 30 day shred."
5,"convenient workout, great for busy lifestyle","Great workout because at 20 minutes, there's no excuse for not finding time for it every day. I do it first thing in the morning, and then it's out of the way! It's tough, but I've been doing it for about a week now and I actually feel energized after it's over. Can't wait to continue to challenge myself with the next levels!"
5,AWESOME,"This is a must have!!! If you are trying to get in shape, tone up, lose weight, improve fitness...or even just feel great... then buy this DVD. WORTH EVERY PENNY. I started seeing results by day 5. Simply amazing. Delivers what she promises. Just do it. I am on day 13 and I cannot believe how much my body has changed so far. I did not even think it was possible. The results I am seeing today... I was not even hoping for to see by the end of day 30. WOW just WOW"
2,It's Jillian. Either you like her or you don't,"I used this for a week and couldn't handle it anymore. It's not that the workouts were too tough, because even on the hard level, it wasn't that hard. It was Jillian herself that annoyed me so I gave it to a friend."
4,"Effective workout, however...","I love this DVD workout. The workouts are challenging and will get you results if you follow them. I lost weight and was toning my body, but by the middle of the third week I had to stop the workouts completely. My knees were so sore to stand or sit that I could not continue. My knees became so sore it hurt to walk. It turns out that I did not have enough quadricep muscle to maintain the tempo and frequency of the amount of lunges and squats in the workout. I paid the price, but the pain was not worth the gain. Having taken some time off, I plan to go back to the workouts with a modified style to be able to complete the cycle. I will still get results, but they will just take longer. Effective workout though."
5,best dvd ever,This is the best workout dvd I've ever used.I love how Jillian keeps me motivated to keep pushing past the weak side so I can get stronger and healthier. I also love that it's just 20 minutes so I can work in a workout very easily in my busy day.
4,Great item,This ended up being a very good item! There are a variety of workouts throughout the video which is really nice! The only thing that was bad was there were some complications with the delivery but other than that it's a great product! :)
4,great workout,Great workout for only 20 minutes! the exercises are simple and easy to follow and very effective!
5,Great aerobic workout - 30 Day Shred!,"This is an excellent aerobic, strength training workout which includes abs toning. And all this in 3 concise 20 minute sessions which can be done alone even by the busiest of us women!"
3,Good workout- a few minutes longer than advertised,"This is a pretty good workout DVD. Simple to follow, not too annoying, and a good workout with different levels. My only issue is that it is a few minutes longer than dvertised. But not a gouge proble,m- I just like to time things and noticed it pretty quickly. Jillian gives good tips and it gets all muscle groups. Like many, I did it for a few weeks and the haven't for a while...."
4,good workout in 20 mins,"This is my 4th day of level 1 of jillian michael's 30 day shred. i've never worked out in a gym before, i've only done some other on demand workouts plus walking my dog outside. i am starting at 5'9"" and about 145 lbs. this workout is definitely a challenge and will leave you sweating if you give it your all. there are no breaks or rests which is why it claims such great results. you do 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. the moves are pretty simple, such as pushups, lunges, butt kicks and crunches, but they really get the job done. almost all of the actions engage your core so you end of with more than 3 minutes of working your abs. i'm still sore after the workout, i've been doing it about every other day, and i can definitely feel myself getting stronger. i would recommend this workout to beginners looking for something to do in the home, because all you need are dumbbells and a mat. good luck!"
4,Works,In the first week I lost at least and inch on my legs and hips and .5 on my arms. It works but after that first week i got bored with it even if i switched to the other work outs. I have been on and off using the dvd ever since.
4,Great product,"Need hand weights but you could use soup cans until you can get some. Even if you don't do the whole 30 min. workout everyday as suggested, even 10 minutes makes a huge impact if you haven't been working out regularly."
5,Ouch!,"For someone who is active, this still gives me the ""burn""! Jillian is hardcore as ever, but I am seeing the results. Stick with it and remember the goal you're working for!"
5,Great Purchase,"I didn't really know what to expect from the Jillian Michaels series, but all the dvds are great. I can feel a big difference in my clothes after only 3 weeks of doing these workouts."
4,Definantly Can See Results,"This is a great workout. I have been exersizing 3/4 times a week for many years, alternating between treadmill, jogging, and also using a fludity bar. This is definantly the quickest workout and I can certainly see results. I have not done any measuring but within the first week I could see some tightening and toning in legs and arms. I had to stop last week for about 5 days because I did something to my ankle doing the cardio on level 2 so that is going to slow down my end result, but I am telling you this works. It is brutal. I could hardly walk when I first started, but I kept going and it gets better. I am really ready to move on to level 3, but to be honest I am a little scared because this workout is tough. I definanlty recommend this!"
2,NOT GOOD FOR BAD KNEES,Level 3 is almost impossible for people with aching knees. There are lots of squat moves with very little modifications. The modifications that are given are too easy and I felt as though I was barely getting a workout. I do not recommend this video.
3,STOP the commercials!!,"Look, you have a damn tv show so why do we need to see half a video of commercials on the DVD especially when you can't fast-forward through much of it? Workout is 25 minutes plus add all the commercials-who has time/patience for this? Who cares about the names of the assistants? Daily major turn-off.3 fitness levels. Lots of jumping jacks and running in place followed by squat thrusts w/ 3-5 lb weights, pushups. More arms, legs than stomach although some crunches. Wear a high impact workout bra. Level 3 is a lot of plank work.Yes, you feel it."
3,OUCH,"the DVD itself is GREAT. Jillian is a great personal trainer and the girls in the back are amazing as well. The only issue I had was that after 14 straight days, my knee and ankle gave out causing me to no longer continue the workout. There is so much jumping (jumping jacks, butt kicks, jogging, etc) that bc of my injuries (not present prior to beginning this workout) that I could not even do modified versions of the workout. Other people that were doing the workout threw their back out and popped their shoulder. This should not be happening to women between 21-23!!! However, if these injuries would not have occurred I am sure I would have gotten ""shredded"". It is great to do bc it is only 20 minutes so even those with a hectic schedule can fit it in and very interactive."
5,Unbelievable fantastic DVD,"I consider myself a pretty in shape person (I am a runner) and I was blown away by this DVD. I started on level 1 thinking it was going to be easy but let me tell you, 2 days later I am so sore. This worked muscles that I never worked before.I am actually looking forward to going home to work out! Definitely recommend to others!"
5,Great work out,Jill does not play when it comes to getting you in shape. The work out runs about 30 minutes and trust me she pushes you all the way. I started seeing results 5 days after I started doing the work out. I highly recommend this program for anyone who wants to get in shape fast.
5,Wowza what a workout!,"This is a great workout! Yes there are some annoying parts, the starting ads etc and her ""advanced"" assistant who cheats a lot. But I can personally say that I've already noticed a change. I love it!"
4,Great workout!,"If you want to maximize your workout in a short period of time, this is the product for you! Warning - you better bring it- this is not for sissies!"
4,great workout,I have only done the 1st set of 20 minutes of exercise and it gives a great all around workout - I'm very impressed with it - the only slight drawback is that you have to listen to the introduction every time - you aren't able to fast forward through it - that gets a little old.
4,A great workout!,"This DVD is a really great workout. I didn't think it was possible to get a complete workout in 20 minutes but Jillian Michaels show you how. You should definitely get this if you find it hard to make time to exercise but want to make the commitment now. The combination of strength, cardio, and abs really works."
3,Great workout - but sick of the intro!,"This really is an incredible workout! I love that it is an intense short (20 min) workout for busy individuals. However, it drives me nuts that I have to listen to the ads and the entire introduction EVERY time. There does not seem to be a way to skip past it. So, while the workout is 20 minutes, you need to allow an additional chunk of time for the intro that you have heard a million times before. I should also warn users that the default option on the main menu (when you finally get to it) is ""Recommendations"", so you need to scroll down to get to the actual workouts. If you accidentally hit ""play"" right away, and try to get back by pressing ""menu"", it starts ALL OVER AGAIN with the ads and intro. Given how good the workout is, I am putting up with it for now. If anyone knows how to get straight to the workout, please let me know!"
4,definitely works you hard!,"Wow. This video is intense! I'm very overweight and out of shape, so start my workout schedule with this video. I can definitely see and feel a difference just after a week with this video. My biggest problem is Jillian. I know she's ""tv's toughest trainer"" but she just gets so annoying. I can't stand listening to her, she's just not encouraging at all. I'm not asking for babying, but a little encouragement instead of belittling would be nice. But at the same token, she gets the job done! It's a great video, a great workout and she knows what she's doing. Now if she'd just stop talking. :) But I definitely recommend it if you're serious about losing weight and getting into shape!"
5,Jillian Michaels Workouts Rock!,"Jillian Michaels puts out quality workout DVD's. I love the 30-Day Shred and go through the program. Do something else. And, then do it again. I never get tired of it. You have to have at least an intermediate level of fitness for these workouts. Even level one has some difficulty to it.Jillian uses different muscle groups at the same time to cut down on the workout time length. I like that because I workout at home before work. I don't always have time to work out for one hour or more.The modified moves are all done by one of the other girls in the DVD. This makes it easy to do the exercises that may be difficult for you.All you need is a mat and a light set of hand weights and a small area and you're set. I've gotten great results from this DVD set."
4,When you've only got 20 minutes...,"These workouts are fantastic when you've only got 20 minutes or on those days when you really have to talk yourself into working out because you'd rather go back to bed! They are short, but still challenging and sweat-worthy. The cool-downs are a little too short for me -- I usually stretch just a little bit longer, but that's not a complaint about the workout. Definitely glad to have these on hand for an alternative to a 30 or 45 minute session."
5,Best 25 minutes of my day...,"..I mean it is revving me up, kicking my ass and making me get in shape...all in 25 or so minutes. I love it... I started the program 4 days ago, so far I've only done level 1 and on some days adding spinning to it as I own a bike (which I also love)..some people mentioned level 1 is too easy..how can it be when you can change the weight up....I mean on my first day I used 5 lbs weights, day two 3lbs and 5 lbs and on day 3 only 5lbs again and so on..you can take it up to whatever level you want/can. I am sore, but not killing me sore, rather tight sore, the good kind ;).I will start level 2 tomorrow and see how it goes and then level three, but maybe come back to level one throughout the 30 days with heavier weights, if nothing else for variety.For the $5 I spent on instant video and being able to watch it on my Kindle Fire...this is priceless, highly recommend."
3,One major problem with this video...,"The music! How in the world did you approve of this DVD Jillian? You are Jillian Michaels! Surely you can dig in your pockets and pay for a bit of Kanye or Black Eyed Peas...or something...Salt n Pepa would do! Whatever in the world was that music in the background? Makes this video painful to get through. I'd love to work out to you, but the music needs a remedy!"
3,"It's just OK, too negative","It's just ok and a little boring and negative. She gives many examples of what not to do: ""here's what I don't want you to do"" and ""you can't do this."" When I'm trying to keep my energy up and stay motivated, these negatives day after day become a drag. In the second workout she makes a weird comment about not quitting so you can look good in jeans or a bathing suit--that's really not why I am working out and getting healthy. I really do like the first workout and so what I do is play the video on mute and then put on my own music."
5,Work your butt off...literally,I hated this DVD (and Jillian Michaels for that matter) for about the first three days of the workout. Every muscle in my out of shape body ached for three days solid. BUT after day 4 I noticed that I had more stamina and that my indurance was enabling me to do the entire workout withut having to stop to catch my breath! Now I am getting ready to start level 2 and I have already lost 6 lbs!!!
4,Jillian rules,You just can't beat Jillian. I usually don't like exercise (aerobic) videos. I am not very coordinated so I found her simple patterns very nice and doable. You will sweat if you don't your not really trying. Her 321 philosophy really works I burned as many calories in her biginners session for 30 min as I do in my spinning class. If you like jillian and you want to work on strength this is great video.
4,"Annoying trainer, but great workout","This workout video is the first one I've done more than a few times--I'm actually in a routine of doing it every other day. It works best for me with the sound turned down--Jillian's commentary is annoying, but the moves are not hard, and I can feel a difference after just a month."
5,Great Work Out!,"Whether you're a beginner or advanced, this work out will work for you. Jillian doesn't blather, she works. She makes you work and she makes sense. 3 levels, 3-6 minute segments w/a short warm up and cool down in each. Also, she is backed by 2 other exercisers, one doing the exercises at an easier level (e.g. not as deep with lunges and squats) the other doing them at a higher intensity (e.g. literally kicking herself in the [...]). The only drawback is that she doesn't do a modified jumping jack or the more modified 'run' so people with knee issues may have an issue at 1st. The nice thing is it's 20 minutes...just when you think 'I am done, can't do another...' it's over and you're done.This DVD is money well spent."
4,I feel like I got a workout!,WOW! I am 44 years old and need to lose about20-25 lbs. I am terrific on the treadmill butknew I had to do more than that.I love Biggest Loser and figured I would givethis DVD a chance not knowing what to expectwhen I ordered it. I finally tried it this morning.I don't know how many lbs. her weights are butI only had 5 and I think I need to pick up 2-3lb. weights.I managed to get through Level 1. I felt like Ihad to push myself and I did. The only part Ihad difficulty with were the push-ups. I felt like my heart rate was up the entire 20 minutes.I do feel this DVD will be effective if I do it everydayor even 4-5 times a week.I sweated and used parts I haven't usedin years. I can't imagine how long it will takeme to get to Level 2...but it all must begin somewhere.Thanks Jillian!
4,Great addition to workout plan,"This dvd is great for those who don't have time to work out, but want a quality work out. Yes people, if you aren't advanced you will feel like you're dying, BUT you can do modified movements. If you can't do jumping jacks, just because Jillian says not to doesn't mean she will spank you if you do! If there are cardio movements that you can't do due to knee problems or something simliar, do a different cardio move. As long as you keep moving you'll be okay. There is no need to give up at all. I have recommended this dvd to many, including those that frequent the gym."
5,great product,The video workout is just as stated and you do feel the workout! I would recommend it for anyone. Very happy with my purchase.
5,WOW! GREAT WORKOUT!,"I work out EVERYDAY. I usually do 1 hour on the eliptical, 20 minutes of pilates, and 10 minutes of light weights for toning. i got this dvd to put some variety into my routine. i started at level one thinking it would be fairly easy. But OMG! it kicked my butt! i've beend doing it for 3 days straight now. and i am SOOOO sore! i used muscles i didn't even know i had! great workout! i can't imagine what level 2 and 3 will do to me when i get there!"
4,Really good way to get up a sweat,"Great DVD for a short, intense workout. The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is because Jillian's voice and style just get on my NERVES. lol But as far as the workout and results, I'd say it's great. It has three levels and I can do #1 but #2 is a challenge. Haven't even tried #3 yet. I like that it gives me something to work toward. Also, because they have beginner and advanced people showing you each routine, there are almost 6 levels instead of just 3. If you want good aerobics that will get you sweating and have some weight training as well, this is a great choice."
4,Super workout; annoying programming,"Jillian's workouts are tough and very productive; she has a great personality and motivates you very well to stick with it, even when you're hurting. This DVD is problematic, however, as you MUST sit through a lot of introductory/promotional shpiels before finally getting to the menu and the workouts. You CANNOT fast-forward through this intro material and must sit there, waiting, while it runs its course every single time you want to work out. This should be corrected."
3,30 day shred,"This dvd is fun and challenging, which is always key for me. It's hard to find dvds that provide a thorough, tough workout. My complaint, and it's a big one, is that the workouts are only 20 minutes! It would be okay if you could easily customize the workout to add on a second workout. This is great for some people who only want 20 minutes of exercise, but I can't do just 20 minutes and maintain cardio fitness and a low weight. I eat too many cookies to do that!"
2,30 DAY SHRED,"This product is just an OK for me. Its a great workout but a bit montonous after the 7th time. Music doesnt get you ""pumped up"" and its basically the same routines in Levels 1, 2 and 3. Is it worth the $10.00 I spent on it? I guess"
2,Listen to your body. My body tells me this is bad for me.,"I gave it 2 rather than 1 star because I did get sweaty & I did work muscles that I have not in the past (despite working out pretty regularly).However, as others have mentioned, it's killer on the knees. You know how you are supposed to feel good about yourself all day after a good workout? This one made me feel lightheaded and tense all day! Also, the intro lecture (that you can't fast-forward through) is really going to get to you after awhile.Try something nicer to your body. You can still work hard and get results without getting physically and emotionally tortured!"
1,Seriously disappointing,"I bought this DVD based on all the reviews saying it was an intense workout. Plus I really like Jillian and thought she would be hard core. I consider myself to be moderately fit, but I'm no fitness freak. I work out 3-4 times a week at the gym and walk the dog most days. I wanted a hard workout, so I decided to skip right to level three without looking at anything else. I just popped in the DVD and went for it. I kept waiting and waiting for the ""real"" workout to begin. Sadly, it never did. If you have ever been to a cardio class at the gym, level three was easier than that. If you do regular cardio, strength training and body building, this video may not be challenging enough for you."
2,Not happy,"My copy was a bootleg. The disc is functional, I'm just annoyed that I paid for something that is so obviously pirated."
3,Kills your knees,"If you have bad knees this video may not be the best choice. I have one bad knee that I'm going for physical therapy for and this video is not kind to it. The jumping jacks and jump rope segments are too jarring for bad knees. I improvise by running around my basement or other aerobic moving around. Overall, it is a quick workout in the morning before work to start your day.The most aggravating thing about this dvd is that you cannot fast forward through the show commercial or even Jillian's introduction. When you are pressed for time and just want to get to the workout, you waste precious time just trying to get to the darn workout. I was so annoyed with it this morning that I almost just said ""forget it"" which totally defeats the purpose of doing it for 30 days. I mean, how many frigging times do you have to watch the front matter of a video?"
3,Not my Style,"I just hate Jillian Micheals, that's the bottom line. I don't watch the biggest loser but was intrigued with the 30 days challenge. I tried to do the workout but finally got sick of Jillian Micheals voice. Also the beginning part you cannot skip so you have to watch her tell you that you can lose weight and you can be great but you have to be responsible. I got an Amy Dixon workout and the Wedding Workout and I like those instructors a lot better, Jillian just ruined it."
3,"Not bad, too easy","Not very challenging if you work out already. Not a bad video, though. Would be great for a beginner! My moms gonna get it"
5,Help!,"Hi all,I got this DVD and 6-week Six-pack in March. I have only done Level 1 of 6-week six-pack so far. I want to start 30 day shred tonight, but noticed that the workouts are only 20 minutes long. Have you guys still gotten results with only doing 20 minutes??"
4,SHREDS YOU INDEED!,I borrowed this DVD from a colleague at work after i told her i needed to lose weight and fast and only in a month's time. She suggested this workout DVD and I've been hooked ever since. The workouts are TOUGH and EFFECTIVE. I've been at it for 3wks now and have lost almost 10lbs! (in conjunction with changing my diet of course) I havent gotten beyond Level 2 as yet because its just that intense of a work out! I felt my body changing and adapting since Day 1. I will definitely recommend this DVD for anyone who wants results and fast. This is why im now on amazon trying to buy my own copy haha :)
4,really works,"this dvd is great, I got this product about a week ago, but my legs and arms were so sore the first day i tried it, my tummy not so much, but i've only done the first workout, hopefully my abs will hurt as much as my arms and legs in workout 2 and 3"
3,"good for crunch days, but not ideal for daily exercize","I was excited to get this dvd, thinking it was genius the segments were only 20 minutes long. Her program is effective. It is great dynamic exercise that combine cardio and strength together, but it doesn't seem long enough for those regular days. It was too fast paced for me to go beyond the modified versions of each pose in each level, and the next day I didn't feel sore like I wanted to. Maybe it's just that I like those longer, slower, more controlled exercises. If you like high intensity, bursting tae-bo like workouts, this might be for you. This would be great on days where you don't have a lot of time though. I did find it a little disappointing there was a lack of variety in the 3 segments (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). Also, one annoying factor of this dvd is the beginning where she is talking and you can't skip it. Not bad, but not the best imo."
5,Never had a video work me out so hard!,"This video is going to make you kick your own butt! Serious work out with an awesome accomplishment feeling after you are done. Jillian motivates you all the way through all three levels! Make sure you have weights for this video, you will want them!"
5,I'm a Shred Head,"This is was my first Jillian DVD - I'm an active girl. I like working out at home because it's convenient. After 30 days I can say I am very happy. I love that the work outs are quick and effective. You'll absolutely work up a sweat. Every level of the workouts creates a new challenge for your body and it's never boring or repetitive. Because of a knee injury there was a time I thought I would never be able to do superstar jumps, or jumping lunges, but after 30 days I'm able to do all of the tough level 3 workout maneuvers, I feel strong and my knee injury no longer bothers me. My thighs and butt have slimmed down, my tummy is toned, my arms look great and I've dropped 1 dress size. What I like best is my body is looking slim and firm, not bulky and built. I love Jillians attitude, she keeps me motivated and feeling good. Although I've completed the 30 day shred, I still continue to do it and have added No More Trouble Zones into the mix!"
5,AWESOME WORKOUT!,"I have been doing Turbo Jam for over a year, and was starting to get bored. I delved into p90x with a friend, and that seemed good, but I decided to try this one for $9 before spending several times that on p90x. WOW, this is a serious workout. I am just as sore after doing this as after p90x. I thought I was in pretty good shape, but apparently not! I love how simple and easy the exercises are, and how all you need are handweights. GREAT DVD! I will definitly buy more Jillian Michaels once I get bored of this one!"
4,Jillian Michaels 30 days shed,This workout video is very kicks butt. It is a very intense workout...I was sored for 3days it must be working good. To get good results just stick to the workouts. The steps are not too hard if you are a pretty strong person.
5,Good video,This is a good video. I like that it is only 20 minutes and gets me sweating. I also love that there are levels to keep it challenging.
3,"good workout, not keen on instructor",I am probably an intermediate level of fitness. I got a good workout from the video but I just don't find Jillian all that likable to watch again and again. Much prefer Jackie Warner.
2,"Not the ""Jillian Experience"" I wanted or expected...","My complaint about this video is not the exercises themselves but the way they are delivered. Like most people, I grew fond of Jillian as the semi-insane, in-your-face instructor on The Biggest Loser. I think her approach resonates with people because sometimes we just need someone screaming at us ""Get up off your butt and get working!"" But there is none of that in this video. It is a traditional exercise video, with decent cueing and instruction, but no ""fire"" whatsoever. Given what I have seen and come to expect from Jillian on TBL, I would think a lot of people, like me, simply find the workout too boring to do on a regular basis."
4,Jillian Michaels- 30 Day Shred,"Great workout. Music is really boring, though. I go back and forth between Level 2 and Level 3 because parts of Level 2 are actually harder than Level 3."
1,This disc injures backs,"After having 3 different existing patients that had rehabbed their old disc injuries show up in my clinic in the past 2 weeks after working out with this DVD, I took a look. After reviewing it, practically every ab exercise flexes the lumbar spine, which studies have shown is one of the quickest ways to herniate a disc. This ""old school"" sit up and crunch method will give you great abs...at the expense of the discs in the lumbar spine. If you have prior injury there, you should stay away from this. If you want to avoid disc injury, you should stay away from this."
5,WOW!,"I was really nervous about doing this DVD because I know that I have had trouble in the past with her workouts. I have a heart condition so I need to be careful with what I choose to do for exercise. I find that I can get through the entire first level no major issues. I tend to modify the cardio just a smidge by doing 1 set of jumping jacks only and then for the other sets I do the cardio punching in circuit 2 because it keeps my heart rate up without putting me at risk of a heart attack of sorts. I find it works well for me. I also find that this DVD is not only great for a 20 minute workout but that my yoga mat is soaked at the end of the workout (as am I with sweat). This DVD is great for a quick, calorie smoldering workout. I highly recommend this DVD."
5,Wow what a workout,"I was so excited to receive my 30 day shred... let me just say this... the first day you do this dvd... you will need to take a day off from working out, it was so hard to even walk, however it was amazing that a 20 minute workout video could be so effective... it for surely gets your heartrate up and you can feel the burn... a MUST BUY for anyone who gets bored with long grueling workouts... this is fast and gets right to the point-- BUY!"
4,Lost 2 lbs in 4 days!!!,"I am an exercise fanatic and always try the latest videos and products. I work out 5-6 days per week doing cardio every day and strength 3-4 times per week. THIS DVD WORKS! And let me prove it to you...Last week I was upset because I looked at the scale after a week of working out a lot and had not lost weight. I weighed in at 139.6lbs! Then, I found Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and after doing level 1 on day 1 and level 2 on day 3, I lost 2 lbs!!! This is incredible! I hope to continue this and lose another 2 lbs by next Saturday! This time flys by on this workout and I really feel that Jillian is there pushing me a long to my weight loss goals. Buy this DVD and you won't regret it!!!"
2,Tore my knee!!,"I was soooo excited to start my 30 day challenge. I read all the reviews but disregarded the ones where they said they got injured, thinking that it wouldnt happen to me. Well 5 days I was unable to walk and in excruciating pain. The dvd has lots of jumping, squats and twists. So I tore a tendon in my knee. I got.a good sweat and burn so I will go back whene s my knee heals. On to the six week 6 pack for now.Update: april 6th, 2012: so now I have two knees with torn meniscus. The last week I have been unable to walk, squat and bend without pain. I was unable to do any videos or workouts. I am highly discouraged, upset and mad with jillian right now. There are alot of reviews I wish id read before ordering."
4,Great Workout,"I haven't exercised consistently in about 3 years so I'm doing Level 1. I've only done if for 2 days, but it's a great workout. It's intense and you are done before you know it!My only complaint is that there is no diet/nutrition information other than referring you to her website or other books. Also, it seems somewhat misleading. 30 Day Shred - meaning if I do this for 30 days in a row, I will see results? Or does it allow you to take any days off? And losing up to 20 pounds...if I only do this workout? I guess I would like some clarification. Anyone have any ideas? I mean, we all know to cut our calorie intake and what to eat, but I would like to know specifically what to do in terms of exercise and nutrition what I need to do to lose 20 pounds in 30 days."
2,Good for anybody with great knees,"There were areas I really liked about the program, especially the strength training and core exercises that I've incorporated into other areas of my fitness routine, but overall it was very hard on my joints, especially my knees, for which I'm still paying. I don't normally write reviews of products, but I felt I needed to for anyone out there that may have weak knees/joints so that they would think twice or at the very least take precautions (that I obviously didn't) before doing the program. I believe another reviewer mentioned modifications for knees (padding, especially during the modified push ups) which should be heeded. I hadn't done high impact exercise for a while and I should have thought twice before ""jumping"" right in. My knees and I will be doing low impact from now on."
4,Shredded,"I love the biggest loser and while I am not completely out of shape I know I am not ready for a marathon either. I usually jog in the park a few times a week but the weather is getting too warm so I thought I would give this a try. My husband and I did it together and while it was challenging we got through it (only 20 mins, otherwise might have quit) and congratulated each other. The next day we were so sore we could harldy sit down, let alone stand up. We let a couple days pass and tried it again and that time it wasn't so bad. Keep with it, its a great workout in a short amount of time and I think she is a great motivator. I did even really bother with the ""diet"" part of the shred, it didn't seem very in depth and I have a diet plan of my own."
1,Not enough time given to ensure proper lunge form,"My main issue with this DVD is the speed at which it moves. I actually liked that aspect a lot, until I got to the lunges. Michaels moves through the workout so quickly (which otherwise is a good thing) that it is very, very hard to ensure you're in proper lunge form the entire time, for every lunge. Even when doing these lunges in front of a mirror, which is what I used to keep myself from overextending, it's quite hard to do them perfectly when you're absolutely flying through the workout. I blew out my knee. It hurts. @*&%. I REALLY wish Gillian would slow the lunges part of the workout down just a little. I'm sure plenty of gym rats (just kidding ;) will criticize me for not having my lunge form down perfectly, but like I said - it's REALLY freakin' difficult to do when you're moving at this speed. Now I can't practice lunges at all, because my knee is all @$#%ed up. Yay."
5,Unreal results,"This DVD is completely unbelievable. I have used exercise DVDs in the past and have never seen very dramatic results, so I was skeptical of this one. But after seeing it discussed on the weight watchers message boards and seeing so many positive reviews, I had to try it. Make sure you buy some hand weights at the same time! (I use 3 pounders)I've been using the DVD about 4x a week for four weeks (I use it as cross training in a 10 mile race training schedule) and HOLY COW. The results are ABSURD. Within a few days I started seeing and feeling increased muscle tone in my arms and abs (the abs are particularly notable, because there is only 3 minutes of direct ab work in the DVD). Now several weeks in and my arms are noticeably muscular and my abs are hard and much flatter.For only 18 minutes of intense activity, this is absolutely the best workout bang for your buck. I am a believer."
2,30 days shred,"The program changes moves too quickly. It is not normal to change so quickly from standing to sitting to lie down. It put lots of stress on joints.Also, there are no option for biginner or some one with knee or back problem.The movements are not bad, but becareful with your knee and back."
1,Useless pre-video,"This might have been good if I had the patience and interest to sit through 5 minutes or so of advertisement and introduction EVERY SINGLE TIME you watch the video. Usually, on most DVD's you can just hit 'menu' on your remote and go right to the 'Play' option, but not on this one! You can't even fast-forward past the junk! By the time you get to the menu to start the workout, you're irritated with the video AND with Jillian. Because of this, I'll not likely be using this DVD again and will stick with my tried and trusted Tae-Bo Amped that allows me to get right down to business in the short amount of time I have to workout. If every minute counts - don't buy this workout DVD."
3,Not a Jillian fan..,"A lot of my friends like this video and I got it to try. If you like a lot of cardio and jumping then you will like it. I personally don't like Jillian Michaels' personality so it doesn't work for me. It doesn't motivate me and I was kind of bored with it. I only did level 1 though and it wasn't as organized as a 30, 60, or 90 day program that spells everything out for you. It all comes down to personal preference but personally I don't prefer Jillian Michaels. I really like Chalene Johnson though and love doing her workouts. I guess that's why there are a million different workout DVD's out there. Pick the one you like."
5,"Old-fashioned, result-gettin' exercise","No gimmicks- just cardio, crunches and a Jillian Michaels' ass-kicking. If you are faithful, you will see a difference at the end of 30 days. 4 lbs & awaist that was 2'' smaller!"
3,A bit hard on the knees,"The exercises are not difficult per se, but the routine is intense and hard, so it is definitely challenging. I just found the jumping jacks to be too much for my 43-year old knees and moved to a low impact routine from another DVD."
4,great workout,It's a tough 20 minutes but worth the effort. I do it every other day to supplement my swimming workouts. Would like to see her make a 30 minute version. The thing I dislike is that you can't skip her beginning speech which is for first timers to the video. You have to sit through it every time. Hope she changes that in the future.
5,Love It,This video is well worth the money. I use it on days when I'm only running a couple of miles. She works your body!
3,30 Day Shred review,"I like the workout, it's good. However, having to go through the introduction every time, and not being able to fast forward has discouraged me, after 2 weeks, from using it.Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred"
2,not good enough,I like the exercises alright but she goes way to slow and with those seconds she waits to go to the next exercise is not helping. You are suppose to keep moving!She goes way to slow for me in this DVD.
4,Never was received,The company I ordered this video from decided not to do business with amazon any more and so I have no idea. But I used my friends video and it was awesome.
2,Boring,I found this workout way too boring. The third stage was somewhat tough but it wasn't something I would want to do over and over again. I would recommend the Women's Health videos rather than this.
4,thorough workout,This workout makes me sweat. It's hard but doable. Great for losing weight or toning up.
1,Cheap video will cost me 100's in medical bills,"Let me start by saying that I am not obese. I weigh 140, am 5'4"" and am 40, so I only need to shred a few pounds. This video got such good reviews I thought I'd try it. What a mistake that was. Over a month later, after only doing the video 2 times, I have serious back pain and have an appointment to go see a chiropractor. It hurts so badly. I have NEVER in my life had back pain, so this isn't some old thing that flared up again. I have always been happy to not have endured that headache of a problem, seeing other people around me with chronic back problems. I guess I will now have to join them after this experience. It's really depressing. My advice? Stay away from this video. It is over the top and not safe in my opinion."
2,Not as metal as I was hoping,"I know being in shape is important for the 30 day marathon shred fest the likes of which metal has never seen before, but come on, this doesn't even go into advance sweep picking techniques, and the tapping section is woeful at best. I would not suggest this product if you want to learn any face-melting solo techniques."
1,I wish I could shred!,"I was really looking forward to doing this workout. I waited a good month to receive it from amazon, so when it arrived I was well and truly ready to go. Can you believe my dismay when I tried to play it in my DVD player and it wouldnt play as it is only for US regions. Amazon should know this and should have sent me an Australian able copy. Not happy!!!"
1,Waste of money,Really? A workout video that you have to listen to the intro to every time? No way to skip to the actual workout? Going in the garbage.
2,faulty dvd,"I have done the actual work out... and I LOVE it!!! However, the dvd I received didn't work. It would pause and skip every couple of seconds in the work out. I've sent it back and am waiting on my replacement dvd. Hopefuly it will work better and I'll gladly up my rating!"
2,Very disappointed!,I found this tape very boring and very basic beginner level - but a decent workout. It is only 20 minute workouts - I had to do 2 in a row to feel I got enough work in. Great for the really out of shape - boring and too short for higher fitness levels. Plus too much talk!!! I like her on TV - but wasted my money on this dvd.
5,Great workout!,"This is a really tough, intense workout-but Jillian really knows how to motivate! The first time I did it I thought I would never make it to the end, but she just keeps on pushing and helped me find strength I never knew I had. I've been doing this for about a month now, still on level 1, but I am definately getting better at all the really tough exercises that I had so much trouble with in the beginning. I feel like superwoman when I'm done! It's a great feeling to make it through a really tough workout-it's very empowering! I think Jillian is awesome-she is really tough, but she knows how to really motivate you and push you to your full potential-and she really gets results!!"
4,Great 20 mins,"This DVD was my first Jillian Michaels DVD...never paid much attention to the biggest loser so I had no idea what to expect. I do want to say that she was very funny and a great motivator. The dvd really worked me out and I was really surprised because I'm such a gym rat. So, I totally recommend this dvd for those who are intermediate level but for those who are brand new I would be cautious about starting this program because it might be to much."
4,"Great workout, she kicks my butt!","I am a new mom and rarely find time in my schedule to work out. The fact that I can get a butt-kicking workout in 20 minutes is awesome. I really like Jillian, I know she comes off kind of harshly, but that is what makes me want to work harder. I think her comments about working hard actually motivate me to get my butt in gear. Just when I started getting comfortable with level one, it was time to move to level two and now I am a whole new kind of sore! This is a great workout for those who have little time, but really want to see changes in their body. Prepare to be sore. I lost 5 pounds in the first week!!"
5,Tough workouts when short on time,"These workouts are great if you only have 20 minutes. This video has three levels; beginner, intermediate, and advance. The beginner is pretty tough and the intermediate and advanced are probably right on target. I like to work out for at least 40 minutes so I usually string two of these together. These are tough workouts, the cardio gets your heart up and the stength training is solid. The workouts do feel redundant with banish fat and no more trouble zones. If you have those two workouts, you might want to skip this one. This is a similar circuit training workout.Jillians workouts are fun to do and do not require a tremendous amount of coordination which is a bonus for those of us who like to workout early in the morning (I'm a 5:30 exerciser so learning complicated dance routines is not for me). I like a workout I can jump in a do without needing a long learning curve. This is relatively simple to learn but difficult to do."
4,Awesome but want more!,I loved this workout- it gets the job done. But I wish it included more workouts- I get tired of the same old routine that I have to keep doing until I'm ready for the next level.
4,Great workout!,This is an awesome video. I saw results after only 2 weeks. Makes muscles a lot more toned in a short period of time.
2,Think 9th Grade Gym Class,"I was very hopeful when I purchased this video. I have the other Biggest Loser video's featuring Bob, and I LOVE THEM. Fast, effective and well worth the time and effort. I am not going to say this workout wouldn't work but it's jumping jacks, push ups, ""butt kicks"" and jumping rope (no rope required). Exactly like we did in 9th grade gym class. If this keeps you motivated go for it but I need something a little more inspiring to dedicate my time too."
1,Kills your knees,"I did the level one for 10 days and my knee began to ache around day 6/7 and thought it would wear off and just needed extra stretching. Fast forward to level 2, day 2 KILLER knee, popping sounds, etc, can barely move around. I am a runner and average weight at 110 lbs (average 10-12 miles/week) and never had any knee issues. I attributed it to the lunges in level 2, but perhaps it is the jumping jacks, not sure. I am going to stick to running and try the ab workout dvd instead."
4,Nice workout,"Not a bad work out at all. It gets your heart rate really going.The first few times I did it, I was sore the day after, and I'm used to working out.Make sure to wear shoes when you do this work out!"
5,Fun!,"It was fun to do. My family ended up doing this workout together. It hasn't been long enough for me to say if I'm getting results, but so far i'm excited to do it. Hope to see results soon!"
3,Boring,"Jillian is awful. I actually started to hate her while watching the dvds. My friend has the same video and hates it too. It is just a lot of lunges, sit-ups, jumping jacks and pushups.I have tried several times to stick with the dvd but always get bored. It is difficult but very repetitive. It is one of the few workout dvds that I never use. If you like Jillian than you may love this dvd."
5,i can already see a difference!,"i have only used this a couple times since i received it couple weeks ago, and already people i know have commented on the difference it has made. i do plan to do it every day for 30 days like you are suppose to but just after a couple times i feel a difference. the great thing is each workout is a little under 30 min., and once level one becomes too easy you can move on to levels 2 and 3. i really like jillian michaels and plan to purchase more of her dvds. i recommend this video!"
5,Jillian rocks!,This DVD is great! 20 mins and I am sweating more than I usually do on the elliptical for 45 minutes. It is a nice combo of cardio and weights. I highly recommend this for all levels of fitness.
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,THIS WORKOUT DVD IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!! DEFINITELY A MUST TO GET IN BIKINI READY SHAPE! JILLIAN KICKS YOUR BUTT... IT'S FAST AND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO THE GYM. I NEVER HAVE AN EXCUSE NOT TO GET A WORKOUT IN BECAUSE THIS IS LITERALLY 25 MINS OF MY WHOLE DAY! WORTH EVERY PENNY!
4,Short on time,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, this DVD. It has three levels so you can advance when you want and is only about 20 minutes of work out time. I used it about three times a week and lost 6.3 pounds and 6 inches total in one month from level one alone; I probably could have lost more if I had a better diet plan and did it every day but thats another review :). Anyway, I really recommend this DVD for those who work out at home and cant spend an hour or more daily in the gym. I work two jobs and attend school full time so my work outs are usually around 5am (when I don't hit the snooze button). This DVD fit perfectly into my schedule."
4,hard but effective,"Although I could not do even the beginning work out to start with, I stuck with it, and have definitely seen a difference in mainly my strength.I would strongly suggest the 30 Day Shred for anyone who seriously wants to get back in shape. Its short, can be done in a small space, and it works."
5,Fantastic Work-out in very short time,"This is a great workout dvd. I consider myself a very fit individual. I used to run daily, but for various reasons I can no longer excercise outdoors. On top of that I have two little boys that take up all of my time so I really am short on time. I was very hesitant about a 20 minute workout because most have you workout then rest and are half filled with stretching and taking your pulse. This was a solid 20 minutes of kickin your butt and no rest. I actually felt like I worked out - and worked out hard. I vary the levels and mix it up with my elliptical. My only complaint (which I think was mentioned in other reviews) is there is a lot of talking and general stuff before you get to the main menu that you can't forward through. If you are like me, and really in a time crunch, I recommend starting the dvd, then get changed into your clothes, get out your workout gear. By that time the main menu will be up and you can start.."
4,Great quick workout,"This video is great for those that have little time but still want a great workout. You do have to push yourself, but you do see results."
4,worth it!!!,"This is a fantastic workout dvd, it packed so much in 20 mins, and i promise, you will sweat till you drop after doing this, and with 3 levels, it fits everyone one from beginner to advance, Jullian is a great yet tough trainer. I highly recommand it!"
5,Love it!,"These workouts are perfect for someone like myself who has limited time and lack of space. I do this DVD right in my bedroom. Most of the moves only require about four feet of space. At the end, I was sweating and sore but not completely overwhelmed. This and fitness pal are the best things that ever happened to my body!"
4,Good workout - bad commentary,"My review is based on 2 parts of this DVD1) The workout in this DVD is really good. I like the mix of cardio, weights and abs in a short period of time. I am not new to working out but the level 1 had me sore a couple of days after I did it. Now, I'm in week 3 and I've noticed a difference in my endurance and strength. I don't do this workout everyday, I rotate it with elliptical and walking 3 miles.2) I don't like the commentary or Jillian Michael's voice. By the third use, I was lowering the volume on my TV because her voice is grating and her comments are strange - she calls her trainers ""buddy"" and says things like "" I could always use a in my life"" as she does the excerise with you. It just comes off as corny. Today, I turned the TV volume down completely and turned on the XM radio in my house and listened to that instead of her voice."
5,AWESOME WORKOUT,"I have been exercising for many years and this workout is really tough. It is definitely not for beginners and it is a little harsh on your knees. I have been doing it for 4 weeks and already see results. However, it is not the type of workout you can do every day. I do it every other day and run 3 miles on the days off."
4,Wow...kick my butt!!!,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a Jillian Michaels DVD, but on a recommendation of a friend I went with it. So far 3 days in I'm feeling the workout for sure! It's fast paced, and only take a short time, making it easy to complete when having a family at home. I definitely recommend this!"
5,Gotta work for it!,"If you stick to this and don't allow yourself to get discouraged I definitely believe you'll see results. Depending on your starting weight you might not be able to lose 20 pounds that quick, but you'll definitely feel better about becoming healthier and being someone that works out!"
5,Amazing,"I highly recommend this workout. There are two people working out besides Jillian and you can follow either one (one is slightly modified). Jillian is very good at explaining what NOT to do. She is very helpful. I will report back after I have done the workout for 30 days, but so far, I am loving it. It really works abs, arms, etc. She changes up and uses weights alot. Love it, love it."
3,watch your back,"This is a great workout and Jillian is a very good and encouraging instructor. My only problem was doing the jumping jacks and some of the other pylometric moves ending up hurting my back. She says that 400 pound people have done them so you can do them too.Now that my back has stopped hurting, I plan to retry the DVD and do cardio moves instead of those that require jumping.The two assistants with her do a good job of demonstrating moves.The twenty minutes was over before you knew it."
5,"Quick, powerful workout","Wow, I really like this workout. There are three workout levels, each 20 minutes long. I've done level 1 a few times and tried level 2 once, and I just love how challenging they are. I'm not ready for level 3 yet, I'm sure. It feels like there isn't a wasted moment, and it really gets me huffing and puffing and sweaty. I like that it incorporates weights to add strength to my arm/shoulder muscles. There's nothing fancy here, and the moves are pretty intuitive. Oftentimes, I hop on the elliptical machine afterwords to keep the sweat going for another 20 minutes or so."
4,Good workout,"I'm a fairly healthy guy, in my late 20s, and pretty out of shape. I found this to be a good workout for me... in fact, I'm still just doing the level 1 workout, and it's giving me a run for my money! I like the idea of combining strength and cardio in one quick, hard hitting workout."
3,The exercises are good but,There is basically no warm up in the beginning or stretches at the end of the video so you end up with sore muscles. The way I solved the problem was by doing the warm up and stretches of other videos I have but it is kind of inconvenient to have to switch Dvds 3 times. I wish that had been part of Jillian's Dvd.
4,Butt Kicker,"I just started this DVD today. I don't have a lot of time because I am a nurse that works 60 hours per week and has four children.I rate this 4/5 stars only because I think it is actually too hard for a beginner and it should maybe start with a level even lower than it does. I'm not fat but am very untone and need work. I'm starting today weighing 136 lbs, we'll see what I weigh every 10 days, i'll be eating a 1200 calorie diet as well. I've been done for 40 minutes and am still shaking and in pain. Michelle"
5,Great use of my time!,"So glad I took I chance on this one! I could feel it working immediately but i didn't feel like I was going to die. During the Level 1 workout she starts you on butt kicks and they do just that- if you do it correctly. I started my exercise adventure kinda winging it but after a few days felt like there were some times that felt like I didn't do anything. I went out looking for something to add to those days. I fell in love with this video. Others are so complex that it is hard to keep up, but this is straight forward doing move we can all work our way up to and have seen around over time. YOu can even choose to do the workouts without her talking and that truely helps- after you know the routines. I am so excited to finish my 30 days and can't wait to see my results!"
2,LOTS OF JUMPING!,"There are lots of jumping jacks and back kicks. If you are big busted or have knee issues, be forewarned. On the positive, it is concise and easy to follow along. She is motivational."
4,Good video to add to the mix,I would definitely recommend this product to those looking for a change from the gym or standard workout routine. You can't beat the price for the 3 quality workouts.
4,Good workout video..,"It's been 3wks of workout and I could tell the differnce, this is a good workout video..your body may be a in pain the first week but its worth it, this is a much have..."
3,Not as advertised,lose 20 pounds in 30 days. She does a nice workout but no dietary info is offered. She refers you to her website where you have to give her your credit card to access the free week.
4,great workout,"My biggest complaint with most workout videos is that they are not challenging enough, and are too gimmicky. Not this one! It is a great, old-school workout that truly does manage to fit a complete workout into 20 minutes. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that you can't fast forward past the lengthy and annoying introduction."
5,WOW!,"WOW! This video is amazing! I am a mother of 4 children, all one year apart. Despite not being back in my prime form, I am very athletic: I run, roller blade, take workout classes at the Y, do workout videos (Turbo, Tae Bo) in my basement. However, this video is challenging, fun, 20 minutes of constant movement and extremely effective...and that is only the first level! I have not made it beyond the first level, as there are three total levels. I was sore for days after my first time through Level 1! I can now pop in the video and immediately feel results. My goal is to do the workout daily, reaching Level 3 eventually and completing 30 straight days. Jillian is awesome!"
5,Great workout,"I love this DVD. It has 3 levels, so it's good for any fitness level. It will kick your butt no matter what level you are, if you are willing to give it your all. Plus you are done in 25 minutes, who can't find 25 minutes?"
5,worthwhile,"This is an intense 20 minute workout. It's good for those times when you want to work out but don't have a lot of time. For me it's a ""no-excuse"" workout because no matter what my schedule, I can find 20 minutes!"
5,Great workout!,I am a beginner at workout videos. This is the best workout video I have tried. Jillian explains everything and I don't feel so clumsy and the moves are not complicated. It works you hard and just when you want to give up... It's over.
4,"Great Workout, Annoying Format","I really like the workouts presented here, especially that they're only about 20min long each. To me, that's the whole point of this DVD, which brings me to the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: there's about 7 or 8 minutes of promo stuff in the beginning that you cannot skip. Literally, you can't skip to the menu to get past the ad (it's basically for the Biggest Loser TV show). If you're like me, you don't want to waste your time watching that over and over again, so I just start the DVD playing while I do something else for awhile. Every time I forget to queue it up, though, I'm irritated. Pain in the butt.The workout itself is a pain in the butt, too, though, which is great. =)"
5,Awesome,These are great work outs! They are only 20 minutes and cover every part of your body! I highly recommend this DVD.
5,Love it,"This is such a great video, just wish I was motivated to do it more often! Jillian's antics with the other girls get a little old, so I usually mute it and play my own music. Great workout though, this works if you use it!"
5,"Quick, but hard workout","The reason I like this workout is because it works you really hard, but for only about 30 minutes. I can usually talk myself into doing this video because it's so short, but it gives results."
4,Third week in...,"So far so good! I like this workout, since I never have time to go to a gym it is nice to have something that actually works at home. I have tried all three workout levels, and I tend to use the first level the most just because that is the one that really gets me sweating. Lost a few pounds already, so excited to continue."
5,Love it!!,"Wicked work out, and it gets easier quickly (although I would never say its easy!!) Highly recommend it if you want to get fit fast. I find the way Jillian speaks to you on the DVD very supportive also, you don't want to give up on her!"
5,30 Day Pre-Son's Wedding Shred!,"I bought this DVD from Amazon and had it about 6 months before I actually put it in my DVD player! I had 8 weeks before my son's wedding and my dress was tight! This workout was killer! I put my daily comments on Facebook and I received alot of support from my friends to finish the 30 days! Planks, push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, squats, oh my!! It took me about 35 days to finish as I missed a day here and there. I only lost 6 pounds, but my dress fit perfectly and I was down a dress size. I was use to the Firm DVD's and was happy with results, but not like the 30 Day Shred. I saw results much faster and I actually saw areas of my body becoming more lean. I'm finishing up Ripped in 30 and I am looking forward to my next DVD by Jillian. I'm 50 years old and about 25 pounds overweight, well now 19 pounds! When I started I was 160 pounds - hoping to get back down to 135-140. Working out with Jillian will get me there, with some sore muscles and Advil!"
5,Great 20 min workout.,You will love the results you see from this dvd! Great total body workout! I've recommended it to all my friends ! One of my favorite Jillian Michaels DVD's. So worth the time and money!
5,Shred & Tighten,From day one I felt like my body was tightening. I've been doing a weight class for several months but level one kicked my butt.I have tendonitis in my shoulder so I had some concerns but the workout seems to be working out the shoulder & it is feeling better.
3,"Good, but...",This is a nice workout DVD if you don't mind the 20 minutes of advertisements (that you cannot skip) before the video starts. I also found that it was a bit hard on the knees.
4,No nonsense workouts,"This is a good addition to my workout collection. Jillian crams a lot into just twenty minutes. With three levels to choose from, there is lots of variety. Great for days you have no time to work out. Very easy to follow. Would be good for men too."
5,Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred,"I love this video! It is quite effective. It's a tough work out but when you finish you feel great about it. I am up to level 2 right now and am seeing great results, weight loss and muscle definition. It's only a 20 minute work out but if you give it 100% you will get the results you want. I an very happy with my purchase!"
5,A great way to mix up your workouts,"I finished reading the book I'm Fat, Help Me and realized I needed to mix up my workouts. I read this article online that suggested this DVD as a way to expand from my usual workouts: [...] I ordered this DVD and it's just what I needed. The instruction is motivating and I'm using different muscle groups, tricking my muscles beyond my usual routine. There are three levels, each with increasing intensity. Highly recommend.Update: The DVD is great, but if you have any knee issues, it is tough on your knees, even when you do the exercises exactly how the video shows."
5,Great Video,Workout is easy to understand and I like the exercises in he video.I have a variety of workouts but this one gets everything done in no time and I am so sweaty each and every time I'm done. I love how effective and a great workout I get with it.
5,Awesome video! FAST too!,"This is a great workout video for the mornings! It's easy enough that you are motivated to get up 30 minutes earlier to do it before work!I can't speak to the ""30-day shred"" aspect because I definitely don't do it every day and don't use it as a main weight-loss tool. I try to do it twice a week as my strength training alongside with running 3x a week. I still get sore from it every time!"
3,Good moves but boring,"Great great workout for beginners to intermediates. If you don't have a problem with being motivated, this is a great workout dvd. For me, though, the music is boring and Jillian has no perosnality. Turbo Jam is more my thing. With 30 day shred I can't wait for it to be over. With TJ, I go twice as long, burn more calories, and have way more fun."
2,Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred,I didn't feel that I got a very good work out with this one compared to some of her others. This one is shorter though so this could have something to do with it.
4,Intense but short,"This workout is very intense, but it's only twenty minutes so I don't feel like I'm getting the results I could be if I were exercising longer. I realize that is part of the appeal. However, though my butt is kicked by this, I feel like I need to put in more time than twenty minutes."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this dvd. You can feel it working on your entire body, I also have her no more trouble zones so I have been switching back and forth. Usually I get very bored with these types of things and I still love it!! Jillian does a great job!"
4,Love it,"I really like this Dvd. i have only done level one because I am so out of shape but I like it. I like how its a short workout because if it was an hour long i doubt that I would follow through with it. I hope I can keep up with this, because I did this for 2 days then after my calf hurt and I was limping for several days. I waited until It felt better and did it again for 2 days in a row. It is not after the second day and I am feeling that pain in my calf again. I hope it will go away with conditioning and that It will not hurt bad enough to stop my progress again."
4,Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred,"This workout is really effective in terms of toning your whole body. I suggest doing some extra cardio with it as well to maximize the weight loss. Its particularly effective for the upper body, mostly for back and arms."
5,For me a nice winter exercise.,"I have to say that Jillian has kicked my butt.. 9 months ago i weighed 160 pounds. I now weigh 120. I started running and dieting and lost the weight within 6 months.. I then bought the jillian micheals 30 day shred. I not only was able to maintain my weight during the winter but I became thinner because I was losing fat and building muscles. Now I am 5 foot 2 inches, so 120 pounds looks like a litter more on my short stubby body but i feel as if im in great shape. I am able to do things I was never able to do before. Not all of this was because of Jillian I lost the weight from running and dieting, but I got in shape with Jillian. Not to mention where I live November-March I would freeze outside running and I get bored with my tredmill. I belive counting out the 30 seconds on the reps really really helps with finishing the cardio. Whatever you do dont stop, dont skip, dont wimp out. I know you can and so do you!"
3,It's Ok,"I like this workout for days when I only have time for a very short workout; however I definitely have WAY better workouts in my (large) collection. I like Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, or No More Trouble Zones way better. I think the suggested rotation for this workout is to do it mostly every day until you feel you can progress?? What about not overusing muscle groups by working them back to back? Most fitness professionals advise resting in between working the same muscle groups. Level one is not challenging for me at all, so I tend to do only level 2 or 3. (I consider myself low advanced, particulary with cardio, more advanced with strength.) She uses very light weights throughout; I keep several sets nearby so I can switch as needed because using 3 pounds or 5 pounds for the duration just doesn't cut it for me. I do like Jillian and find her to be pretty positive and encouraging. This does have a place in my collection, it's just not one I reach for often."
4,30 day Shred,"i don't know if i have lost weight, i have a lot of layers to lose! i am only on day 23, but i definitely have seen some great toning and slimming in areas.you will be sore on day 1, 2, and 3, but stick with it! i did do a yoga video on day 3 to stretch out!! This IS NOT EASY, BUT YOU WILL SEE RESULTS!!! DON""T GIVE UP!your body and mind will probably want you to stop, but you ARE capable of finishing this video!!!"
4,Sweaty Butt Kicker,"This DVD is awesome! If you want to workout for 20 straight minutes--you need this! I'm only on level 1 and I'm sweating up a storm! Jillian is true to herself on the TV show Biggest Loser! She's bad to the bone and you feel like she's right there with you---making sure you don't give up! I truly can't wait to get to the next level!!!I have really bad knees and I'm jumping, kicking and squatting and my knees are getting stronger and stronger!I may not be seeing the weight drop as I only need about 20 pounds to reach my goal but I see the inches dropping and the muscles coming.This is a Sweaty Butt Kicking DVD!!!"
5,Short and Sweet!,"At the suggestion of multiple friends, I decided to give this video a go. I was not let down! Sure, the music is AWFUL, and some of Jillian's encouragement/phrases get a little annoying at times, but it's an AMAZING workout for muscle strength AND cardio all in one---- and all in under 30 minutes! Within two weeks of doing this video (of course combined with some better eating choices), I could see more definition in both my arms and my abs. I'm a Jillian believer!"
4,It's very intense!,"I am a veteran of exercise tapes going back to the old Jane Fonda tapes. I can honestly say that Jillian's tapes are the hardest I've ever worked out to not including Billy Blanks' workouts which were just nuts.I've been using the tapes for about 3 weeks now. I've only lost about 4 lbs but that's because of my eating habits. Despite that, I have lost inches and I look leaner which pleases me and which I attribute solely to the tapes. My lost inches are in the thighs, stomach and butt.To give you an idea of how hard Jillian works you, the trainers that work out with her are unable to keep up. Have you ever seen that happen on a tape before? I haven't. The strength and the cardio are very effective and there is no doubt that at the end of the workout, you will feel as though you have accomplished something."
3,good workout- i wish it were longer,"i purchased jillian's 'no more trouble zones' a few weeks ago and really loved it. i bought this one hoping it would be similar. while the workout was really tough which was great, it was not as long as i expected. there are 3 levels:1,2,3. i thought that each level workout would be 40min (the same as the other video) but each section was only 20min long which was really disappointing. i'm hoping to try the video out again maybe combining levels 1 and 2 to get a longer set and see how that goes."
4,Jillian Michaels,"This video kicked my butt! It works but only if you give it your all and do it at least every other day. Jillian works you hard, but she gets you into shape!"
4,Great video!,"This video is good, gets you working hard in just 20 minutes. The one thing that I wasn't expecting is that you need hand weights to do some of the exercises. Once I bought some of those, it's been going great."
3,"Amazing work out! DOES NOT SPARE THE KNEES, HIPS OR BACK","This is a great workout without a doubt, and although annoying, Jillian is very very motivating.My complaint with the workout is that there is so much jumping, it provides plenty of opportunity for aggravating a forgotten part of your anatomy, in particular in Levels 1 and 3.I'm certain the jump training, as she calls it, is effective to burn calories and for cardio, but I'd suggest an extra 5 or 10 minutes on a workout less stressful to the joints to provide the same calorie burn and strength training without the aggravation, disappointment, and derailment that an injury can cause to a workout plan.That being said... I very much enjoy her DVD and appreciate feeling the improvement in my body and the growing ability to complete the workouts without feeling like I'm going to die!"
1,Bad for the Knees!,"I did this workout religiously in the for 4-5 days a week. I consider myself to be in very good shape and regularly exercise but thought I would give this video a try since my schedule was compressed and I had less time to workout. Needless to say after 2-3 months I have strained one knee and tore a ligament in the other. This video does not allow for muscle recovery time and is too fast of a pace to properly do the lunges, squats, etc. Not to mention my thighs bulked up which wasn't quite the physique I was after. I am back to doing power walking, pilates, yoga and my own version of calisthenics. Yet my knees still aren't the same 6 months later but least I have slimmed down without the bulk. Not worth it."
4,Great buy,"I found the 20 minute work outs to be very effective and challenging in the beginning, but if you are looking for the quick sweat and a good burn, this is a perfect choice. However, I would not reccomend for beginners."
4,Great workout! Try Jillian's other DVD...,"Loved this DVD! This is a great workout, and even as a fitness trainer, Level 1 got me to sweat. I did notice that some of the same exercises are repeated in levels 1, 2, and 3. If you want the ""Level 4"" version of this workout, buy Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" DVD instead, and especially if you are already an intermediate/advanced exerciser, skip this one altogether and go for Banish Fat. I'm glad I bought that one instead."
3,"so far, so good","I bought this to see if it would help me lose some weight. I have plateaued so I was hoping to kick it up a notch to see if it will work (plus eating better will help). I am only on day 3, level 1 and it's tough. When doing the cardio part, i try to take it easy or modify (which she doesn't like) by walking or some other movement to keep my heart rate up. I know many talk about the knee problems and I would recommend the DVD Strong Knees. I noticed relief after the first time I did the strengthening and stretching. Of course I will need to continue for lasting relief. I will continue to use the DVD to see what results I get so that is why I have given it three stars at this time."
4,great dvd to loose weingt at home!,"I think this is a great aid to loose weight at home! it works for someone who as myself, has no time, no interest in getting stuck for hours into a gym, but also wants to get the great benefits of excercising in an optimal way. This woman rocks!"
5,Excellent workout and easy to find 20 minutes in the day...,I purchased Jillian's 30 day shred and I wasn't sure about it but based on other reviews I thought I would give it a try. I was a little worried that Jillian would be annoying but her and the girls she works out with are not at all annoying. I have had the video for almost a month and I am now switching between Level 1 and Level 2. I can tell my body is changing and I am feeling better. I hate to work out but I have only missed a total of about 7 days over the last month. I would recommend this to others.
3,"Good workout, just not for me","This workout will burn calories but it's not for me. I need music and motivation to keep me going and Jillian is just too bland for me. There's no music to pump you up and the workouts are really not that fun. Yes, it's a quick 20-25 mins but I dread the workout because I don't get hype (or pumped up). If you are looking for no frills, get it done type of workout...get this DVD. But if you need music and motivation from this DVD, you won't get it."
5,Excellent fat burner,This CD does exactly what it says it does. It is a fat burner and body toner. By using it's method you jump start the fat burning process in your body. Stick to it. It works!
2,Not my favorite,"This dvd has three 20 minute workouts with each getting more difficult. It reminded me of elementary school gym class. The exercises are hard and it does give a good workout. It is easy to follow with uncomplicated movements. I just think it's really boring. I did it twice. My daughter is 16 and loves it, so it was not a waste of money. This dvd would be good for people that hate working out and want to spend very little time on exercise."
1,couldn't do it,"I used to work out every day but it's been a couple of years now, and now I'm up to 193 pounds so I needed to get in shape again. I got this DVD because I love watching The Biggest Loser and always wished I could be on it. Boy I'm sorry I got this one. I don't expect any workout to be easy, but I couldn't get through even 10 minutes of this. She doesn't let you rest, even to get a sip of water. It's just waaaaaay beyond my level right now. I don't suggest this for beginners AT ALL. it's not that the routine is hard, you have basic squats, jumping jacks and pushups. It's just that physically I couldn't get through it. I'm going to keep at it because to be fair, how can you rate a workout when you haven't even done it all? And I do think it will help shred inches if only I could make it through it! Maybe I will be able to get a little farther tomorrow, and maybe eventually I will be able to get all the way through Level 1."
2,Doesn't Work...,"I am 50 lbs overweight by my estimate and. 20 overweight by a doctor or bmi estimate. Having been underweight according to bmi and doctos i wanted to get back to that.I thought a 30 day solution would be great for summer. I did this program exactly as directed and lost zero weight. Level One is perfect for someone massively out of shape because it gets easier every few days. I moved to Level Two after a week but Three was too much for me. Jillian is motivating and not boring, and the idea that you are moving towards your goal is energizing. Until you reach the end with zero weight loss, zero sizes smaller, and just a temporarily higher endurance as the only change.Other reviews show just how dangeroys this is for your knees and spine. You may not care now, but trust me, when you can't work out AT ALL and can't work either and are home on the couch... you will gain more weight than you could imagine.Jillian should know better."
4,TOUGH,"I could only do this for 3 days, I was so sore! I can definitely see how you would get results after 30 days, I just never made it that long. Good work out though!"
3,Makes you sweat,Can't stand Jillian's obnoxious personality. Other than that the video does make you sweat. I like levels 1 and 2. I like how they do a boxing routine with weights in level 3 so I do that in level 1. I don't like all the bouncing up and down that she has you do. I also don't like some of the moves where you are bending and your head is below your body. I like some of the routines with the weights.
3,OK but boring after a couple times through it,"I ttotally agree that this is a good video, but the problem with any DVD is the repetative nature of them. I always feel like I get a better workout with XT50 Fitness. I like that they are fresh and new every week."
4,Great workouts but Jillian talks WAY too much,"Like I said, this is a great workout and I certainly am not going to stop. It's got the goods and makes you work your butt off.That said, Jillian just talks too much, something I didn't really notice until the 5th time i was doing it and screaming for her to shut up!! But...this complaint of mine could be because I 'm so out of shape and her constant talking doesn't help while I'm gasping for air!!But I do love it and love seeing how I'm able to do a little bit more each time I do it!!"
5,Great video,Great video & workout. My only disappointment is the music - not a great choice. But wonderful workout!
5,"Great workout DVD, fast, challenging and effective!","I love this DVD! I was a personal trainer in my 20's, and still train 5-6 days a week at the gym, so many times when I get a workout DVD they can be disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised at the challenge this DVD presents in such a short period of time. Jillian does a great job of communicating why you're doing a move and why it's effective, and she is great at cueing throughout. The circuit type training she presents is very effective and you know you are working! I've always loved her energy and drive. For me, this is a great DVD to have in my workout library when I can't head into the gym, and want a fast but challenging workout (under 30 minutes)."
5,Great great workout,"I have never purchased a workout DVD before, so to be honest, I just stumbled upon this one, and I am so glad I did. This workout is incredibly challenging, but in only two weeks I am seeing real results. The downside to this DVD is that you have to listen to her 5 min narration at the beginning of each workout, so that gets a bit annoying and is totally unncessary. Also, I am not sure I would recommend this DVD to guys because the workouts seem geared towards women. The rest of the DVD is great. The level one is incredibly challenging, and I am soon to begin level 2, and that has me both excited and nervous. This was a great purchase, and I just recommended it to my girlfriend who is getting married in a few months...if she follows this, she will be wedding-ready in no time."
1,Dangerous,"No-one should ever do jumping jacks for any reason! It puts too much stress on the whole spine especially the lower back and also the hips, knees and ankles as well. It is irresponsible with all the information and education available to allow this type of exercise in any workout. It would not be as bad if it was labeled a workout for people who are not overweight - or if it had a disclaimer stating ""may cause back, hip, knee problems""."
1,Forced Talk Time,"To be fair, I didn't actually do this workout. I do not like being forced to listen to someone ramble on every time I play a workout video. There is no way to fast forward through Jillian's introduction. I usually watch a workout video before actually doing it. Because Jillian's introduction is longer than I care to endure every time I put it into my DVD player, I decided to discard this tape. I own the ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" tape, but was bored with it after about a month. I am athletic, so it is, at times, difficult for me to find challenging workouts that will hold my attention for an extended period of time. The concept seems great, but I don't have the stomach for the long intro."
1,Never watch,Well my mother n law borrowed the movie when i first received it and I never seen it since so I guess it works for her but not for me :)
1,If I could return I would...,I prefer Debbie Sieber's workouts. This one was just a waste of time and money. Jillina's style is a bit masculine - some of you may like that. I don't understand why this is a best seller.
1,NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT,I wish I could have rated this NO STARS!!!I ordered this product on 2/27/2009. I am getting married on 5/16/2009 and wanted to use this as a way of losing weight & toning up for my big day. Well...it's March 30th and I have yet to receive the DVD. I am very disappointed. I have ordered other products off of Amazon and have never been disappointed. There is usually quick delivery & reasonable prices...I wish that there was some sort of action that Amazon could take regarding this seller.
1,good... if u like boring,"This video is really really boring...there is nothing about it that makes u wanna do it again and again. This is coming from someone who loves to workout. I'm sure it would produce results b/c it is a pretty intense workout, I just couldn't get myself to do it more than 7 times."
2,Ok--better cardio then strength training,"I thought this was just an Ok workout--I'm actually surprised to see all the really high reviews it got, and had expected it to be a really intense workout, but was disappointed.I think the cardio bursts are great, my heart rate stayed elevated the entire time, and I was definitely sweating throughout.However, I felt the video was really weak when it came to strength-training. I never felt a burn in my abs or legs, and only slightly in my arms (with 5 lb weights). I will probably still use this workout, but only as a cardio workout on days I don't want to strength train or do anything intense. I think if you are in fairly good shape and workout pretty often, this will offer a quick cardio routine, but I don't think it offers much strength-training for the intermediate level."
1,Do not use if you have ever had a shoulder injury!,I did this DVD ONCE! A shoulder injury which had been resolved is now back in full force. I regret ever doing this DVD. I will now have to deal with recovery of my shoulder again. This $8.00 DVD is going to end up costing me plenty in therapy visits.
1,All talk..and she doesn't even do her OWN Workout!,"I have no respect for these fitness people who stop and talkduring the work out. Explain it BEFORE you do that darn thing anddon't keep stoping to talk to make witty remarks. That's why I dislike this one so muchI just can't take it seriously. For all her ""in your face"" talkI was waiting to see Her walk the walk so to speak. I have Way more respect for CathFriedrich who does it all with her girls. If you want some really toughworkouts with results other then injuries go for Cathe or Amy Bento."
5,Absolutely spot on,"I bought this DVD about a month back and decided to follow the rules and work out religiously. I started the 30 day shred about a month back and the results have been phenomenal. After a week into the work out I noticed dynamic changes in my body. I was toned, had more strength in just a weeks time. Seeing these results I have continued it so far and am extremely happy with my purchase. I am not the kind of person who purchases work our DVDS but I would highly recommend this. I must say the 20 minute work outs are very convenient. A must say for anyone who needs to shed weight or need some toning."
5,WOW,"For a 20 minute workout, this is pretty tough. I work out quite often,about 3-4 times a week, and found myself out of breath not even half way through this work out. Jillian is tough, and doesn't let you rest. Even after doing level 1 about 4 times, I already feel a little stronger and leaner. I recommend this video to any one who wants to lose weight.After doing the Level 1 workout, I could definitely see why the video is called ""30 Day Shred"". I could barely walk the next day. My calves hurt so bad!"
5,AWESOM Workout!,"This is a GREAT way to burn calories an get in shape! No matter how in shape you are, this DVD is bound to burn some serious calories! Each workout is only 20 minutes, but you will be tired and worked out by the end! This is a great way to get fast results!"
4,"Great, short workout. exactly what we were looking for",we bought this as an alternative to another popular at-home workout set. it is nice to have a shorter (20-min) option for days when we can't carve out an hour+. this works well and is enjoyable
2,Getting the Hand,"This DVD wont let you fast forward through anything. I'm a mom and if I'm lucky enought to get ina workout I don't want to waste my time watching warnings, ads and information from Jillian about the workouts every time I put in the stupid DVD. The workouts might be good, but it's no good to have a 20 minutes workout system if you spend 10 minutes waiting to get to the DVD menu."
2,Not what I imagined,"Honestly, from what others wrote, I thought this would be more advanced and more cardio. I only went through the whole first part and half of the second before I felt I was wasting my time and turned it off. Basically, the only cardio in the first half of the DVD are jumping jacks for which I definitely don't need a DVD to do. I thought this was more 'boot camp' like, and maybe for some, it is. But I'm used to one hour interval training classes at my gym with a tough instructor that doesn't quit, so this is extremely mild in comparison. I am going to forward to the last part, but even if that part ends up being totally different and I love it, I still bought a 3 part DVD only to use the last 20 minutes. It's my first Jillian Michaels DVD and maybe the others are better?"
3,NOT for people with BAD KNEES,"I've had this video since last year. I was in tip top shape last year, and when I deviated a little for a month or so, I used this 30 day shred to kick start...which worked great! HOWEVER, now that it's been a good 6-7 since I've even seen the gym (school, career, new house = time pressures/stress)I've not noticed much of a difference even though I've stuck with it for a while! The workouts ARE good and definitely get you going and, most importantly, feeling satisfied after you finish.My biggest complaint though is that these workouts are NOT good for people who have bad/weak knees. I've always had knee problems and today, I'm having a hard time. I did read a review on a different fitness program where the reviewer mentioned 30 day shred and said that though she liked the video, she tore her meniscus in her knee. So, I think I'm going to have to find something different. :("
4,Great workout dvd in 30 minutes!,This is a great hard workout that makes you feel like you worked out for hours and each level is only 30 minutes - she is a great trainer and it seems to be working out great for me. If you dont have alot of time and want to feel like you are getting a good workout this is the DVD for you.
5,Wonderful and Sore,"I purchased this DVD last week and used regular shipping. I received it a day earlier than estimated. There are three levels to the DVD. You will only need hand weights, that can be any weight. I started on Level 1 and told myself that I will follow the person who is doing the workour full blown, just like Jillian. There was no way I was going to just follow the moderate movements! About two minutes into the workout I could not keep up. This is so fast paced and wonderful! Needless to say, I finished barely being able to get off the floor to do the last three minutes. I was following the moderate work outs the entire time. My arms and thighs are so sore today, I feel like I just trained at a gym. I strongly encourage this DVD! One thing that Jillian says on there over and over, is that you can not take a break during the entire 25 minutes. There is NO WAY you can lose weight in 25 minutes with taking it slow. She works you out hard, and this is really worth it."
4,IT FREAKIN WORKS!,"The moves really dont seem that difficult. The workout is divided into 3 segments so mentally 3 does not seem that hard of a number to do. This kept me going. It was like.. "" only 2 more."" "" Only 1 more.""Jillian knows what she is doing, because I actually broke a sweat and felt like jello the next day. This is from only 20 min. of workout. It hurts the first few times then gets better. This video will work you out."
1,Hated it,"I did it for a full month and didn't lose a pound! I did, however, lose quite a bit of flexibility. Not worth the time or the effort."
4,Kicks Butt,"If you are looking for a quick, effective workout Jillian does not disappoint. I have been using the 30 Day Shred for about 4 weeks and have noticed quite a difference. I have always exercised, so I am usually skeptical about a workout video actually giving you a good workout. The 30 Day Shred is much more difficult than I expected, but in a good way. I feel like I am really getting results and it only takes a little over 20 minutes."
4,Jillian is no joke!,"Jillian Michaels is a beast! I was sweating so hard. It's like she's in the room with you. I felt afraid and motivated at the same time -- which, for me, isn't bad. I'm a beginner, so this is just what I need. I pair this with 10-Minute Solutions: Quick Tummy Toners and another DVD (I can't remember the name). I'm only on level one; we'll see if I shape and sculpt my body like she says I can..."
5,Excellent Exercise VIdeo,This is an excellent work out video. Its short but gets the heart rate up. I think it's perfect for people who don't have a lot of time but who want to get rid of those excess calories. I don't have to spend an hour or more at the gym. In 20 minutes I get more of a workout than an hour at the gym.
4,Quite a Workout,"Just as many reviews indicate, this workout is very difficult. I haven't gotten past level one. I am using five pound weights and wonder if I should have started with three pounds. I have done the workout probably 10 times now (2-3 times per week). The numbers on the scale haven't changed but I know it has got to be doing something good for me because it works me so hard! This workout is easy to follow and you don't have to be coordinated to do it. (Thank goodness) I would recommend this workout video but don't get discouraged when you find out how difficult it is. Just do the best you can with it!"
3,like it,kinda borin but effective. only tried one so far. It is good for beginners. very easy to use. Needs better music
3,"Good for beginners, not for Insanity users","If you own and enjoy the Insanity DVDs, this is not the workout for you. It isn't a bad workout, but it isn't challenging either. I thought it would be a good alternative to cure boredom from too much Insanity usage. Instead, it made me appreciate the Insantiy DVDs more. I returned it."
5,jillian michaels - 30 day shred,"I love this video! It is a great workout for all types. I have been working out regularly and when I did this video the first time I couldn't move the next day. I can definitely see results, and I am have stayed on level 1 for 3 weeks now. I am doing the workout 4 times a week. I love that it is only 20 minutes. When I am rushed for time I can still fit this workout in and know that I have worked. Overall, I would recommend this workout highly!!!"
4,Good Workout,"This is a good DVD for people who don't have any knee problems what so ever. I completed 15 days but had to quit because it ""shredded"" my knee faster than my body. It definitely made a difference in my body and I probably would have had great results if I could have stuck with it. I never had a severe knee injury but it still hurt me to where I was unable to finish the last 15 days. Still a good workout never the less. It's just not for me."
4,Oooowwwww...,"I'm 8 weeks postpartum and never worked out much before and this DVD is a butt-kicker! I'm sure I'll be at level one for a while, but I feel great after each workout. It's a quick 20 minutes and a good sweat, very do-able."
1,Terrible Pain,I tried giving 30 day shred a fair chance 5 different times. I workout 6 days a week and am in relatively good shape and this was just miserable for me. It made my knees and my back hurt terribly. I got bored with the workouts quickly and felt absolutely zero desire to ever put myself through that agony again. I will most certainly try other avenues for getting into shape.
4,Good but Ripped In 30 is way better.,I bought this DVD and Ripped in 30 together. I like this DVD but you can tell it's outdated compared to Ripped In 30. This dvd only has 3 workouts that are around 24 minutes. Ripped has 4 workouts that are 30 minutes. This dvd doesn't have as much variety. Shred has moves that repeat 3 times. Moves in Ripped only repeat twice in each circuit so it feels less tedious. Ripped comes with a meal plan. Shred doesn't. If you are only going to buy one buy Ripped in 30.
5,So great! SOO Sore!!!,"I just started this workout today, and nearly 3 hours later, I am stiff and sore all over!! I am 5'6"" 185 lbs, and I know that I really need someone to work me like a drill sergeant if I'm going to get results. Jillian (as we all know and love) is something like a drill sergeant to the people on The Biggest Loser, and they rock their way through her insanely tough workouts. This video isn't quite up to par with those workouts, but they don't leave you lacking.From the very beginning of the workout session, you're moving, getting your blood pumping, and feeling the burn. Within 5 minutes, you're sweating, huffing and puffing, and feel like you can't do another moment. By the end of the 20 minute workout, you can't breathe and your heart seems to think it's going to explode. As long as you stick with it though, it will pay off!! I hurt all over now after doing my first day, navigating stairs seems nearly impossible, but you can bet your a** I'll be back at it tomorrow."
5,Jillian Michaels - 30 day shred,"Love it! This workout kicks butt and definitely gets results, and all within 20 minutes. You will work hard, but can't beat it!"
5,Great workout,Best workout DVD. If you don't have time to go to the gym but u want to lose weight this is great! Easy enough to follow the moves she does.
4,Love this,"So I bought this DVD to supplement my other workouts on days I didn't feel like leaving the house or just wanted something lighter. I was wrong about lighter. This workout is killer! I was super sore the next day and have much respect for those that do this for 30 days straight.I will say, if you are on the upper floors of an apartment or home, it may be a problem as there is a lot of jumping and stomping, but I tried to be light on my feet and didn't have any issues.Other than that I would highly recommend this dvd as either a supplement of an actual workout."
5,Feel the Burn,"This is the best excercise DVD I have ever used. I typically jog for exercise, but when it gets really hot, in the summer, in Central Texas, its nearly impossible to jog outside after 9AM. I bought this DVD to help me get in my daily exercise, when I miss my morning run. I actually think I burn more calories doing this DVD than I do on a 30 minute run.The first time through I was very sore a couple days later, but felt stronger and tighter all ready. I would compare the exercises in this DVD to some of the classes offered at the gym, where you use light weights and do high reps.I highly recommend this DVD, but would caution against doing it if you are an extreme beginner. I think it would be too tough for someone who is not all ready working out."
3,Overall GOOD but not if you have shoulder issues...,"Basically I liked the workout. It was quick and intense. She fits a lot into the short amount of time. I liked that she combined a lot of the moves. My only concern and reason I will not be using this DVD anymore is its a killer on the shoulders! A few years ago I was diagnosed with rotator cuff syndrome and with some therapy and a lot of time to heal I have not felt the intense pain of that injury...until doing this DVD :-(I have fairly good upper-body strength (my job requires a lot of carrying over-head etc) so its not like I don't work my shoulders daily. But it might just be the pace and sequence of moves that brought back that pain. So, as anyone who has suffered a shoulder injury will know, I would rather switch to a different DVD than go through that all over again.But if you have no shoulder issues then it is a fairly good workout!"
5,Tough & effective,"This was my first exposure to Jillian Michaels. I consider myself in pretty good shape and workout regularly on the treadmill; my attitude going in was that level one would be a bore and level two might also be ""too easy"" for me....ha ha.Well, I was surprised and humbled to find even the first level of her workout tough....This is not Jane Fonda (for those who remember her videos!)...no water breaks here! But when Jillian says you'll feel more stamina as early as day one, she's right.The intense cardio-strength combination is a lot different from a treadmill or rowing machine workout, with much to offer regardless of fitness level. It's a huge bonus that the routine is fast, easy to follow, and takes up almost no space.Beginners will be inspired and experienced exercisers will not be disappointed with the results.Highly recommended!"
4,"great workout, but be careful if you are injury prone","Great workout in a short amount of time! I am only about 15 pounds overweight and I wanted to lose a few pounds and tone up. However, after doing level one for a week, I developed bicep tendonitis in my left (weaker) arm from all the pushups. I looked ahead to level 2 and 3 hoping to find exercises I could use to replace the pushups, but I saw more pushups and exercises in that same position. I guess I will rest the arm for a few weeks and look for some exercises to subsitute for some of the pushups so that I can do the rest of the video. Also, be very careful with your knees on all of the lunges and squats."
4,It works!,"I did this dvd for 12 days and could really start to see some changes in my strength and muscle tone and I had more energy. However, on day 12 I strained/sprained my knee and haven't been able to complete the dvd for several days. You really need to be careful not to overdo it! Jillian is so encouraging to really push hard and I think I pushed too hard. If you use caution and don't stress your body too much, I think you will find success. I like how the dvd is broken down into small sections so that you don't get bored of the same thing over and over. I'd highly recommend it, just watch the knees!"
3,Ow! My back!,"I just started the 30 Day Shred and I know it will ONE day work, but after the first day of using the video I have already torn a back muscle and can barely use my arm! I am very flexible and workout on average 4-5 times weekly, but I do have a tendency to sometimes overcorrect my form. I was also slightly confused about how much weight to use for the hand weights. I usually lift weights and thought that a 5 pound weight wouldn't be too much, but was probably the cause to my back strain. I did try using a one pound weight to begin with and didn't feel like I was lifting anything, I wish Jillian would have said something as too how much weight was appropriate. I'll be sure to take it easy the next time I start back to it."
3,good work out but too much talking,"I love this work out, specially the level-2. But Jullian is constantly talking in this video. It is very annoying and distracting. I have music on while I do this video, so that I can't hear all her chatter. Unfortunately, I can't mute her voice completely, because I need to know when to change in to the next progression of excercises. I do however recommend this tape.Very good workout and you will feel it in your arms and legs."
4,So far so good!,"I finally decided to face my fears and get the 30 Day Shred by Jillian. I haven't been working out as often as I should, I bought this Dvd to help jump start the process of getting back into the game. I must say you do work your butt off, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. There is a lot of jumping, but I'm getting better and can do most of the exercises with little or any modification. My next step is to get Level 2 to help mix things up."
3,"Good workout, lousy production","My wife and I work out to this DVD on a regular basis. The workouts included are great. What bothers us more than anything else is that every time we start the DVD, you are forced to watch all the trailers and ads before you begin the exercises. Therefore, we have to turn the DVD on and wait about 5 minutes for all the ads to play through EVERY TIME!! If they made the DVD so that you can skip straight to the exercises, I would have given this a 5 star rating."
5,Very Satisfied,I love Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred! It is a great workout for those of us who don't have the time/money to go to the local gym. I am on day 15 and can see a difference in my fitness level and my body's appearance. I definitely recommend this to those who will stick with the 30 day program. You won't regret it!
3,Had to stop,I loved this workout even though I wasn't seeing results but injured myself after day 12 so I had to stop. She's a great trainer and I'm bummed I had to stop but both ankles got sprained because if the intensity I guess.
4,Becca1821,Sweat like a mother. Easy to get into the habit of doing and you can turn her commentary off which is nice. Haven't shed a pound but I do shred inches because you can see muscle toning. Worth the time and money if you're willing to put the 27 minutes in per day
4,Decent,"Pros -Has different videos for different levels of fitness (3)Just have a mat and weights and you are ready to goGreat for toningCheapCons-No number of ""reps"" to complete which can be confusing when they change camera angles and you try to keep up with the people doing the exercise.Gets repetitiveAfter completing this the first time, I had to stop for a while because I was having knee issuesOverall, I'd say get it but mix it with other workout DVD's as this one can get old and has high knee impact moves."
3,good video,"It defintiely makes you sweat and loose weight, but I needed to put it on mute, her voice is annoying and she constantly sounds like she is yelling."
4,Exercise,I can excerise with Jillian in the comfort of my home. I am looking forward to shaping up in 30 days.
4,So far so good!!,"I like how quick the workout is, but I still sweat my butt off too! So far I've only done Level one, but it's going good :-)"
5,I'd Give it 100 Stars if Possible,"Jillian Michaels, you kicked my butt! I don't know how you put together a 20 MINUTE fitness routine, that is as hard as HOURS at the gym. I would totally, absolutely 110 Percent recommend this to anyone; not just people trying to loos weight, but people who are trying to get fitter and exercise more. I'm on my fifth day, and I see a HUGE difference in my endurance from day one. It's crazy! Let me tell you, it's hard! But it's the good kind of hard; the kind of hard that makes you feel like you've accomplished something.Overall, I would totally recommend this workout video for people who want to get fitter, or loose weight! So, go on! Buy it immediately! You will not regret it!"
5,Day 1,"Yay my 1st Amazon review! OK just completed my 1st day of level 1 on the workout and im sore as hell...I used to go to the gym regularly and I must say I am more sore in 20 minutes than a 1 hour cardio session at the gym, I am scared how I will feel tomorrow but this burn feels great! I can't even imagine Level 2 or 3 but I know I will definitely see results if I follow the 30 day program...Great workout DVD and Must Buy!!!"
4,Awesome!!,"Don't believe the hype - you CAN do this video! The video features both advanced and simplified versions of most of the exercises, and if you follow the timeline, you really can work your way up to the advanced workout. I wish it had better music, but they wouldn't be able to sell it at this price if they had to license anything worth listening to.The best tip I can offer is DO NOT give up! Each workout is broken down into three parts. When you finish the first part, you will not know how you can do it two more time. That's okay. You'll figure it out, and by the time you get to the third round, you'll be able to power through. Start with the regular moves and step down to the simpler modifications if you need to."
4,Pretty Good,I have not worked out in almost a year so I'm a little rusty but level 1 killed me! I gave it 4 stars because I do see myself getting bored with it. I have been doing tae bo for 8 years and it is still my favorite but I'm pressed for time and needed a change. If you're unsure about this video I recommend buying it at collage video because you can return it if you don't like it!
3,Yikes,This is a killer for those who are used to a (5 day a week) moderate aerobic workout. I did the beginner's routine and couldn't walk without pain for 5 days. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's lifestyle isn't all about physical fitness.
3,Entertaining workout,"I'm glad there are 3 workouts on her DVD as doing the same one over and over gets boring and I'm not about to start a collection of workout DVDs. It's hard to do this every day as I'm not always home, but I actually look forward to doing her workout when I can. If you do EVERYTHING she says... no breaks... then you feel really great afterwards. Sore, tired, and accomplished!"
5,Awesome!,"I got this DVD in the mail last week, I work out at the gym 6 to 7 times a week and was thinking I will try level 1 and then get to level 2 the next day. I started with 5 lbs weights on level 1.. Well, I could not move very well from the pain for 2 days. I had a heating pad on my thighs for 2 days. She kicked my butt!!. I have done the DVD 4 times now and use 3 pound weights. I LOVE this DVD, I am going back to the 5 lbs for a few more rounds and then will try level 2 next week.My suggestion for a beginner, do not use weights on your time doing this, if you must, use 1 pound weights or you will be stuck on the couch for 2 days and it might demotivate you. I promise the 2nd time is not as painful."
5,Great,"This video arrived quickly. My friend did two days of the video so far. And man with just a 20 minute video, Jillian kicks your butt on the first day. It's quick and easy to follow...doesn't mean that it's easy to do though! Still an amazing workout with us dripping in sweat and huffing and puffing along during the video. Definitely will keep up with this. Thanks, Jillian."
5,great workout!,"I love this DVD. It doesn't require a lot of space to do which is great because I live in a tiny apartment.Also, it's only 20 minutes. It doesn't take all day to exercise. The steps are not complicated so I often talk my young son into exercising with me. Great purchase!"
4,"Fast, tough and effective!","I love that it's an intense workout that you can break up - so if you only have 20 minutes to spare, you can do 20 minutes. And it will still kick your butt - the first time I did it, I was sore for days, but I knew it worked."
4,quick results,"As a personal trainer this is a product I can really can stand behind. The 20 minute format is easy to fit in the schedule. The workout is intense yet the exercises are simple and easy to undersatnd, nothing too complicated or confusing. You will see results and feel the difference within 1 week."
5,Owns up to her promises,"I've actually not been a follower of ""The Biggest Loser"" but I now am a firm believer in how she is able to get 400 lb. people committed to losing weight and gaining muscle. I have exercised off and on over the years and really am more interested in gaining a lifestyle change that I can stick with versus a hardcore workout that is too intense. Her attitude of giving me 20 minutes a day is superb! While building muscle she is urging our bodies to lose weight through increasing our heartrate. I would gladly encourage all body types and lifestyles in trying this workout video. You can't go wrong!"
3,Not For People With Knee and Back Problems,"I will admit, this is one tough workout, but I wasn't looking for easy. I had read a review talking about how she liked jumping jacks...and she does. I have lower back and knee problems and so I'm not allowed to run for exercise and I'm not supposed to do any jarring exercises, but I was able to replace those movements in level one with less impact, equal calories burn exercises. After two weeks, I felt like I had mastered level 1 well enough to move to level 2. Level is has a lot of jumping/twisting moves in it. Even some of the beginner modifications are not good for someone like me. I haven't checked out level 3 yet, but I may just have to stick to level one (which is still a good workout). My recommendation is if you are someone like me who has knee or back issues, you might want to try something else."
4,What a workout!,"Oh man, this is my second day doing 30-day shred and I'm still only at the ten minute mark on the DVD. This is a butt kicking workout, like everyone says, and today I could feel my first workout from yesterday, all day. It's a really amazing workout, I can't believe I can't even make it past ten minutes! Be careful, you don't even have time to get a drink of water with this DVD so be prepared!"
3,Can't skip info to get to work out,"The fact that I can not skip or fast forward to the workouts is very annoying. I don't want to or have time to listen to Jillian talk about the work out etc. every time I want to just do a quick work out (after hearing it the first time, I do not need to listen to it again)! The work outs are good, but hope any future work out videos will have the option to just skip to the workout!!"
3,Exercise Video,More than my arthritic body can handle. I had hoped to be able to use this but it has proved to be too much for me.
5,"Ok, so harder than it looked...which is great!",I just used the DVD today for the first time. I did Workout 1 and my heart rate was up within the first 3 minutes. I am not a beginner and I run about 15 miles a week. I was a little shocked how quickly this workout got me out of breath. Which is thrilling to me. I bought it so I could have Jillian beat me into shape like she does on the Biggest Loser!!
5,Not for the faint of heart,"I am just starting my workout regimen, and I purchased this DVD. This is not for beginners! It will definitely be a milestone in my workout when I can complete this DVD. However, I am looking forward to that day. I definitely recommend it, but maybe if you're already on a program and need to change it up."
2,Take care of your knees!,"This is not good for the knees. I thought I would buy this cd to stay in shape and exercise at home instead of going to the gym. The only problem was they hurt the knees. I used this cd for a few weeks. At first, I started out with level one to get the hang of it, and then I tried level 2. Well after doing level 2 that one time I began to have this unusual pain in my knees and it never really left. Her workouts require a lot of pressure on the knees. I'm still young and I never had knee pain, until that workout! I'm really hoping it goes away, and soon! By the way, don't be fooled that there only 20 minutes lol, they are tough as hell and by the time those 20 minutes are over you'll be fighting for your next breath."
3,Jillian Work Out Video,The work out itself is pretty good although I thought the instruction would have been a bit more slower. I kept having to pause it and rewind and I'm in pretty good shape!
2,I haven't received it yet.,"ESD was to be Sept 5, and I haven't received it yet. Once I do, I can change my review. I purchased the DVD on August 13th. It's been more than 2 weeks.Not satisfied at all."
4,Bitchin',"Oh wow! This is an awesome workout. 20 minutes of pure hell (but in a good way). Once you start doing it regularly, it gets easier and boy was I proud of myself when I could manage the first workout without stopping. (ok! maybe just for 5 secs. or so compared to 30 secs initially - lol). Also, its easier to get through with a workout buddy.I feel fabulous afterwords. I do change this routine with other workout videos, just to keep me interested.Haven't given it 5 starts because the 2nd. workout (that's what I have progressed to) is hard on my 'bad' knee. So I modify it a little, which she does suggest. I still get a good workout though."
5,OMG! This DVD Kicked my BUTT!,Holy crap Jilliam is a beast! This dvd offers three workouts I am a beginner just a little overweight and I did the first workout. WOW she's tough but she knows what shes doing! I worked muscles i didn't even know i had! I could barely walk all the next day! If your looking for an easy way out than get used to being fat! Nothing in life worth having ever comes for free you have to work for it and like anything you work for you value it more! I am sore but hey no pain no gain -right!
5,30 Day Shred,"Jillian is a beast! If you stick with the program, you will definitely shed some pounds in 30 days! Videos tend to bore me after awhile, but this one has kept me going for more than a month now, and I definitely see results!"
5,IT WORKS!!!,"I gained 50 pounds from my pregnancy this past year, and my son is now 6 months old. I have been exercising to 30 day shred 1 for the past month or so since I still had about 15 pounds to lose to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight. For me, I haven't lost more than 5 pounds (but 5 pounds is GREAT for a little over a month!), which is healthy for me since I'm nursing. But on top of that, my body has changed dramatically! This DVD kicked my butt, but it was quick (as there are no breaks, but it's only a 20 minute workout), and the results have pleased me greatly! My arms and legs look better than before I was pregnant! The abs didn't do much for me, but I've always been used to doing a lot longer ab workouts. The hard work really pays off!! I'll definitely be going to level 2; thank you, Jillian!!"
1,"Gets your heart rate up, but not worth it","I must say, I did not like this DVD. I'd never seen Jillian Michaels before, but her style really annoyed me. What bothered me the most, however, was how unhealthy this workout actually was! She gets your heart rate pumping, then has you lie down for ab work. The ""cool-down"" was just going straight from the ab section to stretching, which jarred me and actually made me sick. If I ever did this DVD again, I would have to add a 5-minute cool-down so I could get my heart rate lowered before I started stretching. She keeps saying she doesn't want people to get injured, but between high-impact cardio, jarring shifts in position and the abrupt ending, this DVD seems like a great way to hurt yourself."
2,Did not like very much,Did not think the dvd was very good. Number of repetitions varied from exercise to exercise and even sometimes within the same exercise. The music did not go very well. It felt like it was added in AFTER the video was made. Maybe there should be a clock timer that we can all see so we know that we are doing numbers based on time and not a particular set number.
5,Fantastic!,"This workout has exceeded my expectations. I am only looking to lose 15 - 20 lbs, but needed motivation to do it. Working out at the gym for hours is not logical for me nor satisfying. If I go to the gym I quickly lose sight of my goal within a couple of weeks. This is short and sweet, but kicks your butt. I was a bit sore the next day, but not like I was after doing P90X. You will start seeing changes very fast."
4,Jillian is my new best friend,"I am still just starting out with this workout, about 2 weeks in, and I have been enjoying it. I definitely feel the benefits and hope to start seeing them if I keep it up! I love that it is a short workout as I am a working mother and don't have an hour or two a day to dedicate to working out. Trying to shed this extra baby weight!! I like there are different levels. Feels like you get more for your money. I like Jillian a lot too. She is very motivating. I would recommend this to people who may not have a lot of time but want a workout that includes cardio with toning."
4,Great workout for people with little time,"Love this DVD- It is leveled, so there is something for everyone. After you are done your 30 days, you can still do the Level 3 and feel that you are getting a decent workout."
3,"Great work-out, but you need to take it easy","This is an amazing work-out, but be careful not to over-work yourself. It is very easy to go too far and become exhausted. Even though Jillian says things like 'see you tomorrow,' I wouldn't do this work-out daily, unless you really feel you can handle it. I think skipping a day or two between work-outs is best, especially so you can help your muscles develop, too, since the majority of the work-out is strength training. But Jillian is very motivating and her two helpers are great, too. It just might be a little too much to do every day."
3,level 1 review,"My wife and I have done level 1 a few times. We thought we were in pretty good shape due to 45 minute daily walks, but level 1 proved us wrong! It kicked our tails! The work out is good, but we feel more stretching is needed than what is demonstrated. A tip for the quad stretches at the end of the workout....if you find them difficult, you might try holding onto something to keep your balance."
2,Too Much!,"This workout will KILL the novice! My goal is to make it thru one 6 minute circuit and still be able to move the next day. My teenage son works out daily and couldn't make it thru a complete circuit. I think it will be great once I build up my endurance, but that's going to take a long time!"
2,Good workout but a big pet peeve,"OK, the work outs are very good, she's good and you do see results quickly, but a HUGE TURNOFF to this DVD is that I can't skip the 10 minute intro before I can begin a workout. I accidentally stopped the DVD, so I had to wait another 10 minutes for everything to reload and play out. Come on already, stop with the advertising and just give us what we paid for. I don't need to be sold on the Biggest Loser or anything else, and this wastes 10 minutes of time when I could be working out. Thanks for listening."
5,"""Killer"" Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred","Wow! Jillian is amazing! Even her beginner's workout kicks my BUTT! She is awesome. Have faith, friends and fans. Follow Jillian. She will get you into shape. Don't expect it to be easy. Anything worth having is rarely ever easy to obtain, but Jillian can get you the bod you have been wanting... or missing. :)"
4,"great workout, but....","This workout video is a great kick butt work out for 20 minutes, but it is only 20 minutes. If you are short on time, this is a great work out. I work out 4 to 5 times a week and this gets my heart pumping. My only thing is Jillian talks the whole time which gets on my nerves. I started off with level 1, but quickly moved onto Level 2 after a couple times, etc."
5,Finally a workout that you can see results with!,After completing the first day of the workout I felt as if I had more of a workout with this 20 minute video then spending hours in the gym. It's true! Plus she has 3 different levels so when one feels to easy you can move to the next. But I am still on level one and work up a sweat every time. I even thought about trying to do level one and then follow it with a level 2 workout!
4,"good workouts, wish there were more","This is a great workout. I am a intermediate exerciser 5x week. There are 3 circuit style workouts on this dvd. Level 1, after 2 workouts was too easy so I am now going back and forth from level 2 to level 3. I love that each one is 20 minutes and she packs in a lot in that timeframe with no breaks. There's cardio,strenght training and ab work. I wish however each level had more workouts to mix it up a little,I have to rotate in some other dvds so it doesnt get boring, there's no way I could do just these 2 workouts for 30 days. All in all, a good addition to your workout library."
5,Results delivered a promised,"I bought 3 Jillian Michaels DVDs togehter, and this was the first one I tried. It was only 30 minutes, but it was a solid workout. I felt the burn after the very first workout and results followed quickly."
4,Really works!,This video is tough. You will hate Jillian Michaels but love her all at the same time.
5,Workout Evil,"OMG!! If you want a 20 min video that will push you to the edge.. You picked it..I'v always been athletic, but damn Jillian Michaels is hard core, I haven't been more motivated, pushed, inspired, and sore as I was from just one workout..I noticed a change in my body in just a week..Im so on my way to being Shredded."
2,Good Workout -- I'm Too Out of Shape for it,"Twenty years ago I could have handled this workout. But now that I'm in my late 50's, it proved to be too much too soon. I'm sure others will benefit from it. I need something that starts out slower. I've been away from the gym routine for 15 years -- it was just too much for this old girl."
5,Exactly what I needed,"When I first heard about this dvd, I will admit, I wasn't very excited. I watch the Biggest Loser from time to time and Jillian isn't my favorite of the trainers. I heard great things about the DVD though so I was intrigued.It's broken up into 3 different levels and each level is broken up into a 3-2-1 system: 3 mins strength, 2 mins cardio, 1 min abs. Just when you're getting used to one exercise she switches it up with something new. Jillian doesn't allow any rest, she wants you to get the most out of your workout, which is under 30 minutes by the way. As a single mom of a 2 year old, that's all I have time for.IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE and i'll certainly be using it over and over again!"
4,Good supplemental workout,"I had never tried a JM video before, and I work out a lot...so I was a little worried that it would not be intense enough for me. However, I have been pleasantly surprised overall. Since I am in pretty good shape, Level 1 was fairly easy. I am on Level 2, which is a good workout. Surprisingly, I think Level 2 is actually more challenging than Level 3 (which I tried once out of curiosity). I think this DVD will be a great supplement for days that I'm not able to go to the gym. Also, I have been combining it with her kickboxing routine.The one VERY annoying thing about this DVD is that you have to watch her stupid intro EVERY time. You can't fast forward and you can't get to the main DVD menu without watching the whole darn thing. I don't think I would buy another video just based on that. Sounds petty, but it's a waste of at least 5 minutes, and when you are in a hurry that's a lot."
4,Good workout.,"The workout is tough but gets you ""shredded"". Jillian is much more bearable than what I've seen of her on Biggest Loser. She does flirt with her two girls in the background constantly, which is pretty annoying.I am on day 20 and definitely noticing a difference, though without an accompanying diet there is only so much this workout will do for you.I was 6 weeks postpartum when I started and I also have bad knees, so I definitely made use of her adjustments for those with bad joints or who are really out of shape.This jump started me, but being postpartum I haven't put in all I could - I think I will wait another 6 weeks and do it again.I recommend this for someone who has little time and is willing to work as hard as they can since it's only 20 minutes."
5,Brutal!!!!!,"This workout will kick your butt!! You definitely feel it the next day! I world recommend purchasing for a nice combo of cardio, strength and abs."
5,"Difficult, but good","Great workout DVD - not easy to do. I couldn't do the whole thing at first, but worked up to it. Brought it with me to use on a business trip. It was great to have a convenient workout to do in the motel room."
5,Finally somebody gets it.,"Finally a set of videos that targets busy Moms that actually works and is something you can stick with. The time commit is stellar, short sweet and to the point. I love these videos and know I can do anything for 20-30 minutes. Equipment needed is minimal and Jillian keeps talking which makes it go much quicker. I will be doing these for a long time!"
5,kicks you butt,This is just the work out you need if you are short on time or don't like to workout for hours on end. It will give you everything you need get in shape and you get to decide how hard you want to push yourself. I love it!!
2,"Good cardio, bad for knees","When I bought this video, I wasn't really sure what I was getting myself into. I wanted weight training and core work to compliment my cardio workouts (swimming and running daily). I got this video because it had highest rating on Amazon. I was very disappointed.I started at Level 1 as recommended and found that it was not for me. I promptly switched to level 3.Pros: Short. Good cardio and you will work up a sweat. Some arm work, but not likely to build many muscles.Cons: Not good leg or abs workout. There is a fair amount of jumping, which is NOT recommended for people who have bad knees, especially if you have a few extra pounds. The warmup and cool-down are also a bit too short.Overall I would not recommend this video for beginners or for experienced athletes."
4,Great Workout!,"I really liked this workout video. It is very challenging and makes you sweat! The only drawback is that there is only one workout per level. I think the video would be better if there were a couple different workouts per levels, but still this is a great video to do at home. I do the video on the days that I don't go to the gym and it is a nice addition to my workout."
4,So far so good,"This is a great video, she keeps you focused and motivated. I also like the free 30 day trial for her online membership that can be cancelled at anytime, but I figured 30 day shred fits perfect with 30 day free trial. You get a great meal plan and stuff with the website. Anyway back to the DVD, Three levels you can choose from. All the techniques you can feel are being worked as you do them. Its easy to keep on this 30 day shred with her as your trainer."
4,Great workout!,"Great workout, specially for beginners, even that it last just half hour, you sweat a lot."
4,THIS WILL GET YOU IN SHAPE!,"This video kicks my butt every time! If I did it more often, I have no doubt that I would lose all this extra weight and be able to go beyond level 1 :)"
5,Great work out,I started this before I started my insanity journey and this was perfect. It will make you sweat! I love how she incorporates weights!
5,Great Workout,"I love that there are 3 20 minute workouts on this. 20 minutes everyday is easier then and hour, and she keeps you moving."
5,An awesome workout.,"Jillian Michaels proves she means business with the 30-day Shred. With the same intensity I have grown to love on the hit show ""The Biggest Loser,"" I feel like Jillian is in the room with me ""kicking my butt"" as I work out with her. The DVD promises and it delivers: intense working out which will have you sweating within minutes of starting. If you can stick with it, along with a healthy diet, I'm sure results will be obtained. I just started, so I can't list any personal statistics, but I can say I feel happier and healthier about my body and esteem than I have in a long time. This is a product that is worth every penny."
3,a little too slow,I saw lots of great reviews and wanted to try it. Thought it would be more upbeat workout. All episodes are kind of boring to me.
2,"ok, but not easy to concentrate because of the nonstop talk","gosh, the woman can not shut up for a sec. it is so hard to concentrate on the exercise, i got a terrible headache. the music in the background was so boring. to be honest, all exercising dvd's out there work for me, not sure why her dvd has got this high rating. it's probably because she was in biggest loser and that itself can be motivation for a lot of people but personally i was not that impressed. i have tried turbo jam before (beach body)wonderful work out + the music is great and the trainer talks but enough to explain the exercise and to give you a push and motivate. Jillian was just too much talk for me."
3,Not for me,"This is great for those who love vigorous work outs. I tried it but its not for me because I do not like high intensity workouts. I'll stick with Leslie Sansome thank you very much. However Jillian is good at what she does, you just have to like her work out style."
3,Not for weak knees,"This is a good workout if you have no knee issues. I've stressed my knees over the years with gymnastics, running and skiing and this video did not work for me."
4,Pretty good but limited options,"Most other reviewers have covered everything relevent - this is a dvd with 3 different workouts, all of which are a 3 series circuit of 3 min of weights, 2 min cardio, and 1 min abs. The exercises are great but obviously there aren't all that many.My biggest irritation is that there is no way to skip the intro and the Biggest Loser promo before getting to the workout unless you leave the DVD in and it starts from the same place and you can just go back a bit. It is so annoying when you have a short window to workout and you can't skip those few minutes of unnecessary video.Other than that, they're great exercises and sufficient variety to pop in to keep your workout routine fresh and the concept of weights/cardio/abs is great."
4,Good but...,"For all intents and purposes this is a good workout DVD however Jillian Michaels is a super annoying trainer, unfortunately I never watched The biggest loser so I had no idea about her personality which I now regret because if I had known I would have never bought it. I purchased this along with Jackie Warner's DVD which is a far superior workout plus Jackie's ability to be a very effective yet supportive trainer makes the DVD a win win situation. For those who want a very good workout but dont really care about the personality of the trainer I would recommend the 30 day shred otherwise if you want the full package-great workout plus winning personality and support I would definitely recommend Jackie Warner's Workout DVD."
4,What a workout!,I have been using this DVD for about a month now. I am absolutely amazed. I have gained so much muscle I can't believe it. My abs are so much stronger and defined now. I have advanced to level two and will probably stay there a while. Level two is rough but the feeling afterwards outweighs all the hard work during the workout. The music is a little too rocky for me but I try to block it out because it is such a great workout. I wish she didn't use the language that she uses sometimes. I know she is a tough trainer but the language doesn't have to be. Overall I am well pleased with the results. Amazing that you can get such results in just a 20-minute workout! Thanks Jillian!
4,Great workout,"This work out is intense at first. I love the three different levels of intensity. Once you get better at one, you move on to the next. It's great the way you have a simple movement mixed with another to maximize your time."
4,My legs are killing me!,"I'm not really over weight, but I am out of shape. I'm 4'11"" and 96 pounds, but my tummy is loose and I really need to tone up. I got this video thinking, whatever, another video that will probably be lame, NOT THE CASE! This video is friggin hard! Its fast paced, and its non stop! By the end I am begging Jillian to let up! I have done it three times, everyday the past 3 days and I swear to you, I am SO SORE! My legs are killing me, my butt, thighs and calves are all sore. The only thing that I will start working out more on my own are my abs. Or maybe I will pair this with my abs of steel video(old school but still effective).I recommend this to anyone who wants to feel the BURN!I will report back when I see progress. I think I will see great things by the end of this 30 Day Shred!"
4,kicked my butt,"I am a mom of 2, so the 30 min workout was very appealing to me. If you work out often, dont' start with the first level .. start with 2. 1 was hard as far as cardio goes, but the weight lifting wasn't challenging to me. Jillian is more my type of coach because she doesn't act all bubbly and fake - enjoy your workout .. I definitely recommend it. I didn't give it 5 stars because I like it a lot, don't LOVE it."
5,Kicks Butt in Only 20 Minutes,This video is great. In only 20 minutes Jillian Michaels works everything. You will definitely feel it the next day. Definitely worth the money.
2,A great workout but...,This is a great butt-kicking workout but you had better like Jillian's voice because you will have to listen to her introduction each and every day because you can't MENU out of it! I find this so irritating that I'll never buy another one of her DVDs.
4,Love it!,I love this video... the workouts are great. My only problem with it is that the you cannot go directly to the menu once the video starts. Each time you begin the dvd you must go through Jillian talking. I'm a busy Mom trying to fit in a workout and the minute or two that you can jump right into the workout sometimes makes a difference. Other than that I love the workout and I would still have purchased knowing that I couldn't skip straight through to it!
4,Wish it had a warm up but I actually DID it,"20 minutes is 20 minutes.... While I wish there was a few minutes of warm up ... I can do 20 minutes of anything. Yes, it is challenging and you will get a work out ( well, unless you are one of the super buffs-- quit bragging) and when i feel like quitting i can talk myself into sticking with it. After 5 days it became much easier--- so just stick with it."
4,Good stuff - Thanks Jillian,"I like the ab workout portions the most on this DVD at Level 1. I don't think Level 2 is as effective for me personally as Level 1 is. I haven't even looked at Level 3. The overall workout is quite good - she crams quite a lot into 20 mins. I do not do it everyday. I personally feel that you should give certain muscle groups a day of rest in between. Abs and cardio are fine to do everyday but certain muscle groups - I've always been told not to work every single day. That said - it's good, it's short and I work up a really good healthy sweat with it. Make sure you are doing those squats and those lunges correctly and those arm movements too! Keep that back straight and those knees should not go over the toe. Jillian says this in so many words but only once or twice. It bears repeating. Worth every penny - buy it!! : )"
5,Amazing Workout!,I only knew her from the Biggest Loser show but I am a huge fan of hers since buying her videos. I am a college student and it's hard for me to find time to exercise inbetween my studies but I have lost 2 inches in my hips with her tapes in combination with my diet thru [...] (HIGHLY SUGGEST IT). I also suggest that you do a combo of her tapes like doing 30 min of 30 Day Shred one day and Yoga Meltdown the next day or something like that. Everytime I do her workout I feel more in control of my body and more empowered. She's really encouraging and I aspire to have a body like hers one day!
5,Kicks your butt!!,I just started using this DVD a week ago and...WOW! You work up a true sweat! I'm already staring to see changes in my body. I bought this because regular diet and walking havent helped with those few last pounds and I really wanted to get toned. My abs are starting to take shape just after a week!! Try it!
4,Awesome work out video,"Jillian is not kidding when she says start at level one. Although I found the cardio and abs sections easier, the strength workouts were killer even with small 2 pound weights. I like this workout video, but I wish it had better and louder music, but I just turned up my own!"
4,good workout,"Jillian gives you a thorough workout with this video. There are 3 levels so you can choose how difficult you want the workout. I'll admit that the first level was even pretty difficult when first starting out, but if used regularly you can easily work up to the next levels."
4,Just finished first workout....effective!,"Purchased this because of the amazing reviews here on amazon. And I will have to agree with them.The first workout wasn't what I was expecting. Kind of expected to feel dead by the end of it rather than feeling energized and ready for more. LolIts over before you know it!I'm not in the worst shape, but then again I'm active duty military, so I kind of have toStay in decent shape.I bought some 3 lb weights to go with it. I think I need 5lb weights when I start level 2.That being said, I'm still a weakling and hate doing exercise. Running is my enemy. LolLevel one of this video is a great way to start. It will keep your ego up while you build back strength and energy that you lost from being lazy for a year.Level 2 will probably kick my ass. And I'm looking forward to it :)I bought this with the yoga meltdown so I could alternate days so I wouldn't get tired of doing the SAME thing everyday.I will try the YM tomorrow. It gets pretty good reviews as well."
3,Really got a workout,"As I'm just getting back into exercising, this was difficult for me. She said she would offer modifications but there really were none. I ended up creating my own low impact modifications. The sequence is good, I like the cardio, strength and abs split but the getting up and down is annoying for a person like me who is not that mobile yet. I did like her go get it attitude and the way she explained and showed the correct forms for the exercises.Overall, I did lose inches but I found this very difficult for a beginner..."
5,Awesome workout,"I love this video! I work three days of the week and needed a 20-30 minute workout before work. I started to do one for a week and now I just do level 1 on Tuesday, level 2 on Wednesday, and level 3 on Thursday. I feel as though I get a great total boday workout in those three days and I love that it's a short but effective workout. The time goes very quickly."
5,A good hard workout,"I've recently purchased and used 30 day shred. It really is a good, hard cardio and strength workout and you WILL see results if you're consistent."
4,Great Video,"This is a good video to help you get in shape. I was new to regular exercise, but this video really helped me get in shape. The jumping jacks made me want to die, but it gets better, stick with it. Great investment."
5,Great workout,Wow what a workout! This is a simple easy to follow workout that really gets your heart pumping!
4,Pretty good workout!!!,"Id say I'm in okay shape, I run about 5 miles a week and do some p90x. I was looking for some cardio to replace running as it has been wearing out my knees. Im still on workout one beginner on this and I'm telling ya, it kicked my butt!!! I definitely felt my heart rate go up!! I wouldnt say you would get all over toned from this, but I definitely think its great little cardio!Im not able to skip the beginning, so it kinda has a slow start of the repeat but not too bad. She goes through pretty fast because there is no stopping during this 20 minutes"
5,so hard,This workout is so hard and works muscles you forgot or didnt know you had! I got through about 5 days and had to take off a few days before being able to get back to it. Thanks Jillian!
4,Love/Hate Relationship,3 20 minute workouts that are tough. Love doing these on days that I don't run. They always make me sweat and I am usually a little sore the next day. I feel like I get a great cardio/strength workout even though it is only 20 minutes long.
5,Wow...amazing!!,This video is amazing. I've only been doing it 3X per week and I've lost 8 pounds in a month. My body is shrinking because I've built so much muscle with this video. It's definitely not easy but you can do anything for 20 minutes. I only had about 10 pounds to loose so this video definitely worked for me.
5,Excellent,This dvd has 3 brilliant 20 minute work outs. I have just progressed to level 2 after 2 weeks and cant believe how much I sweat in 20 mins. I definitely feel more in shape and probably if I had followed a strict diet too you I would have shaped up in no time! Really recommend it. Jillian is a brilliant trainer and very encouraging with her comments during the dvd. It makes you want to keep going and push on.
3,"Good workout, but I don't know if I could do it 30 days straight....","The workout was very good and intense, and that was level 1. I haven't even touched levels 2 or 3 and I am not super over wieght or out of shape. I would say I am about average. This DVD whooped my you-know-what. I was ore for days. I think the longest stretch I have done it was 4 days. It just gets so repetative after so many days, and it is so intense, I need something more low-key. Even if that means I have to work out longer.I do recomend this as a good hard core ""quick"" work out, but not a 30-day ""shred"" Give your bod a break to recover!!!"
5,Workout From Hell lol,"I used this DVD the first day I bought it and Jillian Michaels kicked my ass. I am 23 and out of shape after 2 kids. The first day I didn't make it through the whole workout. My thighs and calves were screaming hate words at me. Lol. The second day I was so sore so I was doing something right. After using it again I felt strong in my lower body already. I am on day 3 but loving it because I can't wait to be healthy again and start losing weight. I would recommend using this along with a healthy meal plan. I am still looking for one that works for me. But I love this DVD and would recommend it. I also like how it has 3 different levels that way its not just an ordinary, routine kind of workout DVD. This DVD mixes things up. Kinda like a cheaper version of P90X. I love it. :)"
1,DESTROYED MY KNEES!!!!!!,"I have always been in great shape (I ran half marathons, swam 3-4/week, went to the gym regularly etc) never having any injuries. I decided to add this to my routine a few months before my wedding. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Right away I knew that some of the exercises weren't healthy for my knees as they were overextending (the side/front lunge for starters) I should have stopped after the first time but tried it once more thinking I should maybe slow it down. Turns out I tore both knee ligament. I showed the DVD to my physiotherapist who scolded me when I obviously knew better. I love Jillian but she runs through the moves WAY to fast (while holding weights) and it becomes just too dangerous. Plus everyone knows you shoudn't be working the same muscles every day - they need time to recover."
4,Fantastic workout with one exception...,"I haven't found Jillian's workouts my style so I was hesitant to get this one, but did because of the good reviews. I don't regret that, this is a good workout and really got me sweating. The only exception is that I hurt my knee during jumping jacks. She says 400 pound people do jumping jacks and I'm nowhere near that, but I do have weak knees and they didn't appreciate the jumping jacks. I modify them now during this workout but go really fast to keep the same intensity. If I burn 50 less calories, I can live with that as long as I can keep working out and I'm not sidelined because of an injury.This is a great quick workout that really gets the whole body involved and Jillian is less abrasive in it than she normally is."
3,Great workout but annoying DVD,"First of all, the workout is great ... when you get to it. The way they made the DVD is such that you have to watch a commercial for Biggest Loser show, then a warning and some other stuff before the workout every time! There's no fast forwarding right to the workouts! I found this highly flawed and annoying... especially when I do the workout every day.The actual workouts were tough, yet simple. No choreography to learn. For some this may get boring, but if you want a quick, tough, no frills workout... this is great."
5,Love these workouts!,"I have never done workout videos before, but I really wanted to tone up and build better upper body strength. I have been doing this every single day and am on my 21st day. I started the first week with level 1, moved to level 2 for the second week and now am finishing out on level 3. I can't believe how my heart rate gets up and going and muscles burning in only a 20 minute time frame. I've defiantly noticed improvements. I don't have a 6 pack yet, but I believe it will get there! I can see definition in my arms too. I typically do the workout in the mornings and it gives me a great jumpstart to the day. Would highly recommend this to anyone, boys or girls."
3,Jillian Michaels Shred video,"The video is o.k. If it did not get jammed at certain parts it would be better. That has nothing to do with the content, just the quality of the disk."
4,not for weak knees,It really makes you sweat and gets you out of breath quickly. If your knees are weak this may not be for you. I'm 49 yrs old so I think I need to find something else that considers weak knees and my age.
2,Changes I would make,I hate that you have to go through the entire intro every time just to get to the exercise. I want to be able to put it in and start my workout.I hate that there is no diet guide with the workout. There should be something that tells us what we should be eating during the 30 days shread
2,A lil disappointed,I had high hopes for this DVD. Level 1 was intense kick butt. Level 2 was a lil lame. I hardly broke a sweat and i went to level 2 the next day. It was way 2.. I don't know but just not what I thought. I will mix level 1 on this DVD with the Banish Fat Boost Metabolism DVD.Circuit training is a new thing for me so maybe that is why I was a little disappointed. Imma keep @ it till I lose those few stubborn lbs.Delivery was fast. I had just barely logged off the computer for the nite when I had the DVD in my mailbox(jus kiddin).
2,Ok workout---BORING,"I found that this workout DVD was very boring, within three days off using it, I had already memorized everything Jillian says. The workout itself is ok, it didn't make me want to scream for mercy, but I barely worked up a sweat, and I'm not a very active person!"
1,Product should come with better description,"I had knee surgery 3 years ago and this video did nothing but aggravate that weak spot. I tried this workout last night and can't straighten or bend my knee all the way today. If I had known I'd have to spend 20 minutes bouncing, jumping, lunging and squatting, I would have passed on this DVD. There really needs to be a better description of what moves are in each of the segments."
3,Too Much Intro Before Workout,"There is way too much introduction that can't be skipped or fast forwarded through. I can see why you would need to listen to it the first time, but why every single time? It's very frustrating to have to stand there and wait for 5 minutes listening to the same thing day after day -- sometimes I talk myself out of exercising before she's done."
2,not difficult at all compared to insanity,"I was looking for something to change up after completeing insanity bc I still have quite a bit to lose. Not this, I didn't even break a sweat in the 1st workout, but second coulda been a warmup. 3rd was decent-ish"
4,Very inspiring but don't like abs bit,"I really like this gal. She is funny and inspiring and I like most of the exercises, so that I can get my teenaged daughter to do them along with me. The one thing I do not like or believe in is all of her Abs work. I have always noticed (and this was no exception here) that doing crunches just pops out the fat over your ab muscles and makes you look thicker through the middle. So, unless you have very little body fat already, I cannot recommend the crunch parts. I am average build 5'4"" and 115 lbs and exercise regularly, but still find this part not to work for lovely middles. Other than that, I love that you can do a quite exhausting workout in only 20 minutes per day and in your home. Now there really aren't too many reasons not to exercise."
2,Bootcamp Workout,"If you like to workout standing up, and cool down with floor excercises do not get this DVD. If you do not like Bootcamp style workouts, do not get this DVD.I really wanted to have great abs and seeing that the reviews for this DVD were so high I thought I'd give her a try. She makes you do JumpinJacks, then lay on the floor for a sit up, then jumpinjacks again, then lay on the floor. My head was hurting really bad from laying down and jumping up. I was very dizzy and I thought I would pass out. I could do the excercises, it was the laying down and getting up that made me nauseous.It's not very fun and she pretty much does the same excercise sets every 3 minutes with a slight change. I do not recommend this for people who like their workouts structured like mine: standing up, and cool down with floor excercises. If you want to have fun while getting your body in shape, try turbojam or some type of dance workout instead."
3,Challenging but painful!,"I have mixed feeling about the DVD... it definitely produces results, but I and several friends who have tried it have had a considerable amount of pain and soreness - mainly lower back, knees and ankles. I'm VERY careful to follow the correct form and do the modified moves where needed, but although I've felt an increase in strength and endurance, I can't seem to do the workout on a regular basis without considerable aches and pains. Doing a longer warm-up on my own before starting the DVD helps (brief warm-up on the DVD is no where near enough for me - same with cool down/stretching at end). Not sure if it's me or the routine - but I'm taking a break and trying the Yoga Meltdown instead."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I started this video Monday and yesterday woke up feeling like I ran 10 miles!! My entire body is feeling the effects of this 20 minute workout. I don't have much time to workout with having a full time job and a 4 year old so I get up 30 minutes early and am done before his feet hit the floor!!Jillian Michaels - 30 Day ShredJillian Michaels: Yoga Meltdown
5,Great daily nugget of a workout,"I bought this mainly because each workout is short, and even with how busy I am, I can stick in 27 minutes somewhere. Even starting at the first level, this workout is surprisingly intense. It gave me quick results as far as weight loss, and I did build my endurance quickly (who knew 1 minute of jumping jacks would be that tiring at first?) I love how you switch between activities enough that the time flies by. I use this as a little extra workout at home if I can't get to the gym, or if I just need a little boost."
5,Work Hard - See Results Fast!,"I've only been doing the level 1 and level 2 videos for a week and a half and I'm already seeing results! I'm losing inches faster than pounds, but that's fine with me. Several people at work have come up to me and asked what I was doing because they can tell I'm visibly losing weight. I won't lie, this workout is tough. I sweat more during these 20 minute videos than I do running a 5K. The workout moves are relatively basic (basic not easy) but the combination of strength, cardio, and abs appears to be extremely effective. I highly recommend this video for people who have already been incorporating exercise into their routine. I'd say it's a bit too advanced for beginners."
4,Great for lazy days when you don't feel like putting too much time in,"This DVD is great to have around the house. I couldn't see myself doing this DVD religiously, but it's a great compliment to any workout program. I personally loved the 30-day workout BOOK by Jillian, but those routines would usually keep me at least 45 minutes at the gym. This DVD is nice because you can do this at home within about 25 minutes. It's a tough workout and will make you feel good after you complete it. Great price, it's a must have!"
4,Happily satisfied!,"I was recommended this video by one of my girlfriends and was a little skeptical at first but thought I would give it a try. I am not a huge work out person and had not worked out in a long long time prior to trying this video, so I was of course a little bit nervous. But after doing just the first week, I was hooked. It is an amazing workout and is only 20 minutes a day which is perfect for my lifestyle! It has definitely made me want to work out more and has encouraged me to want to get healthier!"
3,"Built muscles, Not slimming","I adore Jillian Michaels and the work she does for the Biggest Loser so I thought I'd try her 30 Day Shred -- YES! This video works the heck out of you, builds your core and almost every muscle in your body -- If you are looking to build muscle, this work out is for you - 3 levels, very difficult. BUT if you are looking to simply tone and slim down a little {like lose a jean size} you may want to look for something more cardiovascular focused - With this, I'm only 130 lbs. and all the jumping was very hard on my ankles --"
4,20 Minutes of Jillian kicking your.......(you know).,"The video starts off with Jillian stating that she has heard that she is one of the toughest trainers around,....and she admits that's probably true - AGREED. Jillian is no joke! If i could I would hire her to be my personal trainer. This DVD is the next best thing. I picked this up after getting hooked on TBL (The Biggest Loser)and seeing how tough and real she is as a trainer. She doesn't allow any excuses when she's training you and she will push you; that's a given! There are 3 levels on this DVD. The first level is challenging if your not in shape; because she doesn't allow ANY resting between the exercises. The DVD is essentially circuit training, going from one exercise to the next and then back again in a cycle WITHOUT rest! I would definitely recommend this to anybody. It's a great workout!"
1,Hated It!!!,"I could not get past all the chaos to enjoy the workout.I wanted a workout with real people ... not these plastic factory line dime a dozen hollywood products! Hated Jillian always saying ""if you want to look like this you have to do what they do"" and the music was awful."
1,false advertising,"I ordered this dvd 3 months ago..due to a medical condition I just picked up the dvd today to check it out. Imagine my surprise when the packaging was already slit open. It was advertised as new. If it was I'm wondering why it wasn't sealed. I've never had a problem before with amazon, so I hope this doesn't start a trend.Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred"
3,jillian michaels 30 day shred review,"I have enjoyed these workoutsJillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred-while they are short, they are are definitely hard and useful. My only complaint is that there is no meal plan included with this product, or a chart of when to do each workout. Maybe that is self explanatory to some people, but I would prefer a chart that gives me an idea of how to start. In the video, Jillian just says move on when you think you're ready, but if you are still eating the way you always do without a thought to calorie intake, what good are you really doing yourself?"
3,Too much work!,"This is a good book if you want to cook all of your own meals and figure out what type of ""metabolizer"" you are. Too much work. Basic premise: eat healthy & work out!"
1,Horrible,When I got this video it was a blank disc-I could not get it to play on the computer or in any dvd player. Unfortunately it was a gift so I could not return it. I was very unhappy with this!
1,Never again!,I have been sold a product which is void of using. This DVD is not configured to play in this region. I live in Australia and I didn't know that if you live in a different region you could not play this DVD. Amazon have falsely advertised and sold a product which is infective to use. I will not buy from them again!
4,Whoa!,"I got my DVD yesterday, and it was way beyond anything I expected. The only other videos I have used are the ones from Jenny Craig that I have had for over twelve years. I have been exercising on the elliptical and have been changing my resistance level, but nothing prepared me for this workout. Like many people stated, it was very intense. I started on level 1, but there were many parts that was extremely challenging for me. Despite slowing down in a few areas, and making my own modifications, I still sweated more than I have ever sweat on the elliptical in the 20 minutes of the session. The sessions went by really fast, and I did not keep track of time during my workout like I usually did on the elliptical.I'm over 200 pounds, 5'2, and really want to lose weight. I felt stronger after just one workout and already want to do more. I can't wait to see the results."
4,Kicked my butt,"I just had a baby and really need to get in shape. This is perfect because I am totally 100% out of shape and really needed something that isn't ridiculously hard, but was still a challenge. This is it. I'm still on level 1, and when I'm ready I'll go to level 2 when I need a little more. Plus, it's only 20 min/day. It's hard with a infant to get away from the house or spend an hour working out."
5,Tough but it works if you stick with it,"I ordered this dvd and now see that it is on sale. It is worth the $8 I paid for it. There are 3 levels and modified versions of some of the exercises. It's 3 cycles of: 3 minutes of weights, 2 minutes of cardio and then 1 min abs. Run time is about 30 minutes if you include stretch and warm-up. I tried my Power 90 dvd a few days later and I was so much stronger.If you want an even more challenging workout try the workouts from her book 'Making the cut' which also includes a meal plan."
1,Buyer Beware,These light bulbs (as well as a number of others) are a total rip-off. You have to pay attention to what voltage is used to calculate (and state) the wattage and lumen output. The scam that's going on of late is to use 130 volts instead of 120 volts. Bottom line ... you are going to end up with a much dimmer light output than the wattage you're used to at 120 volts when you get a 130 volt rated bulb.
1,Turn off the sound,"This video is soley for those who enjoy looking at the very handsome Colin Firth. The story is unlikely, confusing andsoon beomes very tiresome. There was not a spark of chemistry between the often undressed leads. If you love Colin Firth asI do, I suggest you turn off the sound and just enjoy the images of this beautiful man."
5,Wonderful read!,I have to say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read! I couldn't put it down once I picked it up and have read and re-read it to the point that I need to get another copy because my original copy is thrashed! I recomend this book to anyone who wants a read that keeps them on their toes and leaves them wanting more.
3,Lots of sex and stuff,Well let me tell you in the end i ended up burning my copy of the book. I mean after i read it over. However descriptive this book maybe its goes nowhere and well kinda trashy in that fantasy way. so if you like that kinda stuff go for it you'll love it. and if you're not... look somewhere else
3,Mixed Well,"I am a man and I loved the movie, but then I happen to think of women as better than most men. Perhaps that's why my wife keeps me around. Anyway about half this soundtrack is great and about half will wear a little thin after several plays. I still recommend the soundtrack, especially if you like Perfect Day. A Thousand Miles, and Watch Me Shine."
4,fun and catchy,"the cd overall is very fun and upliftingthe songs are light mostly light and pop-y witha few ballads and hip-hop stuff thrown in.on the good and bad side, a lot of the artists i never heard of..which gives them a little show out there, but i can't find them anywhere! oh well!try this cd out girls!"
5,"Paradise On A Disc, Baby!","This is paradise on a disc, baby! Ever heard the song ""Perfect Day"" by Hoku? You liked it? 'Course you did! And you know what? That song is on the soundtrack! Talking about faith, people. Um, okay. Seriously, it is a great soundtrack and it's worth your money. This CD is not just for all the blondes out there, I'm not a blonde and I really liked it. So I bet you will too. Even guys will enjoy it but are to chickenish to admit it. C'mon guys, let your inner music style get out and order this! It's a perfect CD for the summer and to cheer you up in the winter. The songs are great, the movie is great, it's all great. Don't forget, ""Perfect Day"" will make your day perfect. You know you wanna buy this... diddle1987@hotmail.com .[e-mail me]"
3,Songs missing,"While the songs on this CD are good, not all the music that's in the movie is on the CD. That was a big disappointment to me. So beware."
4,Great Product,"The CD is in great condition. It has minor wear and tear, but looks almost new! The delivery was very prompt and the product was delieverd before the estimated time. I suggest buying from this seller."
3,It's B.S. all over again...,"If you're a pop fan, you'll love this CD. There's a whole ""pseudo-Britney Spears"" thing going, with several female power songs (i.e. Tracks 5 and 8). The opener (by Hoku) is very airy and ""blonde"", even by pop standards.BUT: Vanessa Carlton's Thousand Miles is a bright spot on an otherwise dull track. The piano rifts are excellent. The other instruments (including various strings) combine quite nicely, and her voice is relatively unaltered (it seems). If the rest of her work is anywhere near this caliber, you can bet that she's a rising star.All-in-all, it was (probably) a decent compilation for the movie, but since I'm not a pop fan, I can't give it more than 3 stars."
4,RRREEEAAALLLLLLYYY Good!!,I think this soundtrack is great! The songs make u want to get up and dance! All of them are really lively and fun.(eccept for like 2 but who gives a care they're still ok) and the artists are ones that u already know are good. At least that was how it was 4 me. Just 3 words: GET THIS CD!
3,Casting Shadows,it was a gift and just perusing it was enough to know I am going to enjoy learning the various technique in the book.
5,Casting Shadows: A Super Creative Book!,The book was easy to read and understand..I can't wait totry some of the ideas...Anyone can do them..It was well worthevery cent...
5,The Best there is,"I've read, or tried to read :) many genealogy books. I often skim them because they can get VERY boring.Sharon Debartolo Carmack knows how to write!She adds bits of humor and tells it like it is in very understandable form.I enjoyed this book very, very much!"
4,Still worth a glance,"Some of the information in this book is growing increasingly outdated, but it remains a solid research tool for both cemeteries and genealogists alike. It is true that much of the info is now available online, but it's still interesting to find a tool that shows you how to find the information yourself."
4,WONDERFUL book for Genealogists!,This book is a wonderful resource for the weekend genealogist or just someone who loves graveyards! I bought one for myself and one for a friend for her birthday- she is a cemetery lover - she was thrilled! I read it cover to cover myself.
5,Wonderful!!,"This live performance in England is wonderful! Andy did shortened versons of many of his hits as medleys in order to perform a wide variety of other songs. His vocal quality (at about age 50, I believe) is excellent. I saw him in Vegas around this same time period, and this show at Royal Albert Hall reflects the same warmth and excitement I witnessed in person. If you're an Andy fan, you must have this."
5,"get your own web page, FAST!","learn to MAKE a web page, with lots of templates with business and personal designs, one button publishing, and forms for orders or customer information! For Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, 2000. Hard to find software, but easy to learn!"
2,T harness only does part of the job,The item is okay. Not as easy to install as the company would like one to believe.
4,"a very fine album, because it's his first",with a little help of his Father Phil the debut album of Simon Collins is very intresting for all the audiance. A new way for technical musik.
5,Andy Williams sings Love Story & other pop songs,I used to own the actual LP back in the 70s (my mom has it now) so was very happy to see this as an album download. My favorite track was Love Story. But all of the songs are nice covers. If you are a fan of Andy Williams I think you will enjoy this album!
2,Interesting but not what I 'd expected,"This book is not what I'd expected. Only half of a chapter contained short biographies of the different Cleopatra's in the Ptolemy dynasty. A large part of the book is dedicated to descriptions and interpretations of remaining statues of the different Cleopatra's, mainly the first ones and the last. In my opinion it's not really about the Cleopatra's in the title, but more about the world in which they lived."
5,Good size,I ordered this to make fondant cut-outs for a wedding cake. It worked perfectly! They would also be great for cookies.
2,If you're a rubberband,"I purchased one other dvd of hers and loved it. This one is a little out there. If you are super experienced and want to be awesome at yoga this is a good dvd. If you're just looking to stretch, not a good choice. Pretty difficult moves."
1,seriously?,"This was the most rediculous yoga dvd i have ever purchased. I can't even believe they sell these. It's really hard to take Yoga seriously when the instructor has hair that she has to whip out of her way to get into a pose. I like long hair and all, but seriously."
1,disappointment,I am a yoga teacher and I own many yoga dvds.Usually I can predict if it will be a winner.Well this time I was very wrong.I dont know why anyone gave it five stars. Firstly it is so distracing with the noise and the movement and most importantly are you supposed to follow along? There is no instruction at all! This is a dvd of Tara Stiles showing off her yoga poses! Very decieiving unless it should have been titled Tara Stiles doing her yoga for herself. Maybe she should watch shiva Rea or some of the other qualified teacher to see how you teach yoga on a dvd rather than just showing off the poses...
1,Can't understand her mumbling!,"I read about Tara Stiles and her new yoga video in Women's Health Magazine and after seeing all these five and four star reviews I thought I'd give it a try. Stiles starts the video by saying something along the lines of #this is good if you are a beginner..."" Believe me when I say that is not true! She is so fast and she is mumbling. I couldn't follow one move and I barley heard what she was saying when I was doing my downward dog. Also, the background music is stressing and annoying.I am sure this is really good if you have been practicing for quite some time. If you haven't - stay away!"
1,Too advanced and confusing for high beginner - intermediate Yoga Student.,"After following Tara on Facebook on Youtube I was excited for this DVD. I am high beginner to intermediate and this is too confusing and difficult to follow along with. The setting is distracting, you can't understand her, there's really no instruction. Did I miss something?! I'm sure she is a great yoga instructor (she has a huge following!) but this DVD was perhaps a concept that needs more work. I will still try out her Jane Fonda Yoga Video and hope that's better suited for me! But my honest recommendation is: If you are a beginner to intermediate student wanting a CD that you can really learn from you should pass on this DVD. If you are a Tara Fan it could be a nice addition to your collection but I don't see it getting much use."
2,More Hype than Value,"I love yoga, and have been practicing it regularly well for over 2 years. I feel super comfortable with the poses and enjoy classes with a variety of teachers. So when I got this DVD, I thought only great things would come of it. Unfortunately not. While Tara is awesome and truly knows her yoga, the DVD is far from an instructional tool. It can serve great as yoga entertainment, as yoga art indeed, but not as a DVD to help you with your yoga practice or to even be able to easily follow along or would even want to."
2,Too old to be informative,"If you are only looking for an example of how historians used to write or how such writings compare to present day, then this book may well fullfill your needs.If, on the other hand, you are hoping to learn something on the history of London that isn't slanted to old fashioned thinking, ideals with outdated and sometimes false conclusions as to what ""might have happened"", then leave this book well alone.I found it sloppy in its chronological presentation, biased towards old fashioned ideals and eventually boring and un-informative."
4,A good history of California,This book is one that I am having my Spanish 2 class read. It is a great source of the history of California in the 19th to 20th century and it has a lot of detail about migrants. I enjoyed the stories of the families and how they interacted with one another. I think the book flows nicely but there were a few loose ends that I think could have been wrapped up more thoroughly.
4,Sunset in style,"This is a truely eclectic mix of chill-out tunes ranging from Radiohead to the Pixies with some Balearic beats thrown in aswell. That said, it works. Totally original, there is hardly a weak track in the whole set. Every track is totally diffeent yet the seamlessly work togetherPerfect summer grooves. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of A Man Called Adam or the Real Ibiza seriesTraklisting: 1. Artemisia - Rachel Z 2. Big dream - Coco Steel & Lovebomb 3. Collage of dreams - Beltran, John 4. Steady (punta del este mix) - Man Called Adam 5. Climbing up the walls (Zero 7 mix) - Radiohead 6. Night at Estudio Copita De Nieve - Fulton, Maurice 7. Sya - Bagayogo, Isa 8. Vuli 'n' Delia - Fassie, Brenda 9. Inner meet me - Beta Band 10. Worksong - Tosca 11. I was told - Tal 12. Neon heights - 16 Again 13. Favour nothing - Presence (2) 14. Monkey gone to Heaven - Pixies"
4,Wonderful performances by Itzhak Perlman,One of the best violinist of our times. I enjoyed very much listening to the 2 CDs. Also great value for money.
1,Ego Gratification,"I'm sorry but this book seems to be more about gratifying the authors' egos than actually helping anyone contribute a development tool to eclipse. As a previous reviewer indicated there is a CULT feel to the whole business. Page 2 shows the pyramid of enlightenment. One can imagine Gamma and Beck sitting on the point. Of course there's money to be made in such cults and I suspect some of the ""rave reviewers"" are trying to cash in.However, eclipse itself is not so bad and the on-line documentation (as opposed to this book) is actually useful. I particularly recommend the articles by John Arthorne.I'm sorry about giving such a negative review but I think it's important to discourage this kind of ""cultism."""
3,Its okay for a BOA version,out of all things i didnt think this would make it to america. Blast buggy had missles this does not. I dont know exactly why BOA said no missle but its all good at least we got the toy. So thing is we will as far as i can see be getting everything this year unlike the last few years.
1,Totally shocked anyone likes this type of writing,"Very dated! Every male was arrogant & non-feeling, each gal was a door mat. A total waste of my time!"
3,"Reprints, again.","New cover, old stories. Although I enjoy her work, it is time for some new writing. How many times have we all bought books only to get them home and discover that it is the same work being released one more time. This seems to happen too much with this talented author."
3,Actually better than three stars...,"I have been reading Diana Palmer for a few years now and I have read almost all of her numerous books and I have to say that the first time I read these stories (in separate books) I really enjoyed them. The reason why I gave this book only three stars is because Ms. Palmer seems to repeat her stories quite a bit. If you are an avid reader you will know exactly what I mean. Each of these stories are very good, especially if you have not read much of Diana Palmer. If you have read a lot of Diana Palmer, you probably have already seen these stories or read another one of her books that is VERY similar."
4,First in a long line,"Sitting with this book in front of me, I recall that this was the first book of Ms. Palmer's that I read. I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the books in this one volume. It led a friend of mine and me to try to acquire as many of her titles as possible. We still have a few to find. Although they are written along the same story lines, I find them a good way to escape the everyday hustle and bustle."
5,A must for Folk Fans,"First heard this album in high school and found it 25 years later. Very catchy songs, and his best work in my opinion."
3,Loudon wainwright iii Album3,Dead Skunk was the reason I bought it and it is the best track on the album. The rest is mildly interesting but not outstanding
2,Bought the cut down the forest version,The book is well written. It presents the various topics in a way that you can examine the code and determine for yourself what it means
4,Good guide for beginner or casual Birders,"This guide is a very useful for the casual or backyard birder. It takes the route of showing pictures of the birds instead of illustrations. The real benefit however is the layout of the pictures. Instead of grouping the birds by families, or genus, or species it groups by the most recognizable features of shape, size and coloring.The drawbacks of the guide however are that the detailed information is placed not with the pictures but in a seperate section. Secondly the other main detraction of the book is that while the pictures are a great place to start in identifying birds illustrations can be the better route when you advance to more difficult identifications. A great companion volume for this would be the Sibley Guide."
1,Incomplete and inconvenient,"This book, although had good intentions is a very inefficient and incomplete field guide. It only has pictures of some of the birds, and usually only one plumage, which makes it impossible as a reliable field guide for fall shorebirds and warblers, and juvenile birds. The pictures of the birds are also seperate from the descriptions and range maps. In addition the pictures are organized by color rather that family. So, if you know you are looking at a warbler you can't go to the warbler section you must find the section of the pictures that has e.g. birds with yellow plumage. Pictures of birds in flight are all but absent in this guide, so if you don't know your hawks, etc. you won't be any better off with this book. I would recommend a more complete and easy to use guide like the National Geographic field guide."
4,Generally Satisfied,"This book is very nice. The pictures are great. The pictures will even tell you what to expect, such as if it is a female or if it is the bird's light phase. The only thing I wish is that the descriptions along with the general area the birds are located in was with the pictures and not in the back of the book."
3,Not quite as helpful as I had hoped,"Having finally moved to a house that would give me an opportunity to see a wide variety of birds; I thought a guide would be useful. Not being an avid birdwatcher I thought The Audobon Society would be the place to look, but I found this guide to be just OK. Separating the photos from the descriptions is more than a little annoying, and the photos themselves only show one angle so identification for the novice is often dependent upon seeing the bird from the correct angle. While fairly comprehensive and not without its uses; I will look elsewhere for a guide that better suits the needs of the novice birdwatcher."
3,"Identify the birds that visit your homeplace, or wherever you go.","The Audubon publications are the best amd most comprehensive guides available for identification, and this one on birds is not an exception, but I would prefer that with the many excellent high quality pictures, that females were shown along side the males for clarity. Only a few female birds were pictured."
3,national audbon socity field guide,The condition of the book was excelent. However I was looking for better photos to aid ID of birds.
2,poor delivery,book ordered and it is now 30 days since being ordered. delivery promised in up to 21 days (i do not understand why media mail was not offered-i use it often and delivery is without a hitch) and it is now 30 days and no book!! greatly disappointed!! j.m. fleisher
3,"Good Pictures, Info; Poor Organization","I have used many of Audubon's Field Guides, and they are very helpful and usually organized and easy to understand. However, this one is extremely complex and confusing.When I find an interesting bird, I would go grab my binoculars and field guide and look it up. I go to the correct catagory and frantically search for the bird. When I find it, it gives me a detailed color picture that helps identify the bird. However, if you want more information, it than refers you to a different page, hundreds of thin pages away. You than need to go and find the page, but by then, the bird is gone. When I do get to the page, it is filled with wonderful detailed information of appearance, voice, habitat, nesting, range, map of habitat, and a brief summary.The book is nice, but I would recommend buying another one with more organization."
4,Recommended,"I've got this edition and an older addition. Excellant information and great live photos of the different birds of Eastern North America. Would rather prefer a birding guide with the text with the photo on the same page though. But that aside, this is recommended."
4,"Easy to use, compact to carry in the field.",This field guide contains most of the wild birds found in the eastern United States. The photos are very good and the descriptions make identification of birds a cinch. Compact size fits well in glove box or on the window sill next to the feeder.
4,audubon society field guide....very good,"The book was received quickly and was in great shape. I've used it many times, identifying birds in my backyard and at the local lake. I would use the seller again.Thank you."
5,National Audubon Society Field Guide to NA Birds:Eastern Region,"This is a ""must have"" for everyone. The format is very easy to use. The photgraphy is spectacular and the descriptions of each bird is very readable and easy to understand. I have given this book to many of my friends and relatives so they too may enjoy and identify the world of birds."
5,it's for the birds,"Best birding book around. Great pictures and very good descriptions to go along with them.Divided into easy to find groupings and sub-groupings. If you're into birding, this is a must."
4,Very handy reference book for the casual bird-watcher,"While I don't consider myself to be a ""birder,"" I do enjoy watching the birds which come to visit my yard, and I like to be able to identify them. I've found this book to be very handy in helping me to name the birds I see both in my yard and during my 40-minute daily commute. The first part of the book contains clear, full-color pictures of each species, helpfully organized by both types of birds (eg, tree perching, upright land, etc.) and color, making it quick and easy to find the bird you are looking for. The second half of the book offers useful narrative information which is both detailed and concise. My one complaint about this book is that for most birds, there is only one photograph, making it hard to distinguish between male versus female, immature versus mature, etc. Overall, however, this book has greatly enhanced my pleasure in backyard bird-watching."
3,"good photos, but...","The photographs are excellent, and at least Audubon no longer tries to list birds by habitat (a highly frustrating and unproductive scheme). But the plain fact is that no set of photographs, however carefully done, can every make as good a field guide as good paintings can. Go with Peterson or NGS every time!"
2,toilet monster,"The suction cups do not work on many toilet seats. Though the idea is great, save your money unless you have some to burn."
2,Suction cup holders wouldn't keep their grip...,...for more than a couple of minutes (no matter what I did) and the toilet monster kept falling into the drink. Overall it was quite underwhelming as a practical joke. I've gotten much better results for the same money with other products.
2,Cleaning up is not funny,Do not buy this to fool your humorless or myopic roommate. He will just crap on top of it.
1,"Terrible instructions cause tears, mess",Nowhere does it say in the instructions that you must remove the toilet monster before using the toilet. I ruined my monster and my rubber gloves cuz of that.
5,Watch out for these,"Contrary to popular opinion, the toilet monster is NOT a funny joke to play on people you care about. One time a friend of mine planted a toilet monster on his little brother and boy was that funny because he DIED from fear!Just the same though it is a great weapon to use against your enemies, so I give it five stars. Heed my warning though."
5,My First Lois Greiman Novel,"I chose this Lois Greiman novel for a summer read by the cover image... as I felt just about that UPside DOWN at the time. But I couldn't stay there after opening this book and reading only the first couple of chapters. Lois, you healed me and my funny bone in 2008 with this one. I've saved thousands on therapy by reading the rest of this series through the 2008 holiday season and look forward to the next in early 2009."
4,"Scissors with 8"" bent handle a hit!",I purchased this scissors mainly for the ergonomic handle. My mother-in-law still does crafts and this scissor works well for her. She is the best critique of scissors in all venues as she has sewn and crafted for over sixty years and she has seen a Fiskar scissors or two!
4,Good for adhesives,Works good for adhesives. Bought because price was the same as regular Fiskars. Will purchase this type again if a similar price.
5,Super sharp!,It seems every time I pick up a pair of scissors to cut open a plastic food bag or a piece of string I end up with a non-cutting tool. These Fiskars cut easily and cleanly. I highly recommend them as a great value.
4,NonStick Scissors,"Scissors work pretty well, could be a little stronger especially at the tip if cutting multiple pieces of paper. Nonstick surface is excellent so adhesive will not gunk up on blade."
3,Very right-handed scissors,"These Fiskars 8-Inch Non-Stick Bent Scissors have a very right handed design. Cutting with the left hand is uncomfortable. At present there is nowhere on the description that tells a prospective buyer about this. I thought that since there was no hand designation on the website, that they would work for both hands. Perhaps this information will be useful to other prospective buyers."
4,Megaman battle network 4,"WOW!!! This book does a good job of presenting the game, the only thing that keeps it from the fifth star is the fact that both stories are intertwined in the book instead of being separated. The p.a (program advance) list is extensive and the battle chip list is great along with the soul unison list. Everything you need is in this book."
4,Sing to the Lord a new song,I love Paul's songs and this CD is great. He teamed up with others to write new songs to praise the Lord. Our church's worship leader has been introducing songs from this CD for the last few weeks to our worship time. I had to pick the CD up and I'm so glad I did. You will not regret this purchace
5,'A Greater Song' is great Christian music,"This is a nice blend of upbeat, joyful Christian rock songs with slower, touching, introspective ballads. Paul Baloche is a good worship leader..."
4,"its a review, not the entire event",awesome viewing if you're a moto race fan. the shots consist of a lot of on-board dash cam and helicopter camera. only gripe would be that it does not have enough actually race scenes and too much non action scenes.
3,Nice,"It's a nice product. I liked it, and the person I was giving it to, as well.There is just a thing that I didn't notice when I bought it is that each photo holder can be used one way, because of the acrilical folder in the top part. I would have liked to know that in advance (in the description product), but it's ok, we figured how to print the pictures."
5,"Great product, too small for D7000","While this case can stretch to fit the Nikon D7000 with a small fixed lens, I returned it and bought the next larger size. Had my camera been smaller, the D5100 or D3100 series, I'm sure it would have been a great fit."
3,Design melted off,These are pretty good molds except that when we poured the candy mixture in the design essentially melted off so you couldn't see the gymnasts very well. There should be a warning or something indicating the temperature range.
4,enjoyable,i really enjoyed listening to my old favorites by faron young. the music brought back a lot of memories to me. a very nice purchase.
5,waited 47 years for this!,"In spring 1964 i visited Nashsville for the first time and as Liverpool singer Gus Travis i must have created some interest and was invited on WSM for a chat.Faron and the gorgeous Margie Singleton were on too promoting their fabulous duet single Keeping Up With The Jones's.Faron and Margie gave me an autographed copy of the single,but i've waited years to get a clean,non-vinyl cut of my favourite Faron track,thanks!"
2,this stranger my son,I was not happy with this book. It is more warn then what I expected.Jacket is torn same pages ripped.
1,Uninspired,"Oh dear, what a pity ! It started reasonably well, but quickly dove off into the realms of absolute silliness. Frankly, it got so bad, I couldn't get to the end. Sorry, Marna Hale Leaks, but this one wasn't for me."
5,A Excellant Addition,"Aside from only briefly mentioning Englands EDSAC (as is the case with most non English accounts), this was a nice and entertaining read. Not only detailing the Computers themselves but the inventers, designers, craftsmen, and engineers of the machines. Technical enough to keep those who want it content, but written understandably for those who may not be so technically inclined."
4,"Another fine ,twisted electronics release....","I give this a four star rating only because Intersystems' next release (""Free Psychedelic Poster Inside"")seems to me to be their best. But this is certainly another wild and fun album.Here on ""Peachy"" you can find the same sort of almost ""beat"" poetry spoken during wild bursts of sound and effected voice snips swirling around your speakers,...but maybe a bit more ""dark"" in subject matter this time around.Come and hear early free-form sounds of an electronic nature and thrill to stories about ""caves"", ""guns"" ,and what happens to the men who find them!!! Yes,thrills and chills ....they are all here. All this in a swirl of fine late 1960's electronics! Their next Lp would seem to be their best,....but here is more twisted elcetronics fun for your mind's eye. Get it while you still can."
5,Fabulous!,"It's impossible to find this cheese in our dinky little town and it's fabulous! This is original string cheese - the stuff people bought before Kraft and the like mass-produced a version. This is *nothing* like the plastic, flavorless sticks that pass as string cheese now. This is light, flavorful and oh so yummy! You will not disappointed!"
5,The best cheese I have ever devoured,"Yes, I devoured this cheese within a week... but i could have eaten it in two days, it was so good... the texture, consistency, and the flavor was like heaven in the form of solidified milk... i think my mouth exploded the first time i tried it. Will definitely buy again (but the shipping is more than the product... oh well. worth it for its incredible taste! )"
3,Second sight,"This book caught your interest with its storyline, but Sophie left a trail anyone could have followed. It was an OK story but I just felt that something was missing."
1,Snake Cream,Please do not waste your money on this snake cream!!! I would give it a 0 star rating if there was one.
4,Very Sweet,"This is a very sweet CD, and a ""must have"" for lovers of old-time music. With Janette now gone, her live voice will be heard no more. This collection preserves songs of yester-year. Their pure and unpolished voices are refreshing."
1,From bad to Old Age to......Worse?,"I'll tell you.... There's a difference between being plain and being just plain bad. The original Carter family had a 'plainness' about their singing style that authenticated them as true backwoods Americana. But these two people... Man. There's only one person who's singing sounds worse than Janette Carter's did on those 'On the Border' discs (when she was a teenager)..... That would be Janette Carter on THIS disc when she became an old woman. Dreadful stuff. And old Joe isn't much better. He can hardly carry a tune. Irrefutable proof that just because someone CAN do a thing doesn't necessarily mean that they should. Stick with the original threesome. That's as far into the realm of genius as 'plain' is ever going to get. Plain bad isn't going to leave this page, unless you do something foolish..."
4,"LONG LIVE ""PEARL""","FOR THE MOST PART, THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM OF LIVE JANIS RECORDINGS WITH BOTH BIG BROTHER AND THE HOLDING COMPANY, AND FULL TILT BOOGIE, THE BAND SHE RECORDED ""PEARL"" WITH. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SONGS WHERE SHE IS A BIT OFF AND THE BAND BEHIND HER DOESN'T QUITE GET IT RIGHT (MOST PROBABLY ATTRIBUTED TO MASSIVE ALCOHOL AND DRUG CONSUMPTION), BUT MOSTLY IT'S GREAT, 'CAUSE IT'S LIVE JANIS, AND SHE WAS THE GREATEST WHITE FEMALE BLUES SINGER EVER."
3,We need a better live retrospective than this!,"Those of you who have never heard Janis live before, this is a nice start, better than FAREWELL SONG. Unfortunately, it's the only decent mainstream example we have of Janis live! The Kozmic Blues Band has never been looked upon as brilliant, which they are, and deserve something put out by them. The most disappointing this is that the songs are cut to pieces, especially the 1970 Big Brother songs. For those who want dynamic performing, try looking for bootlegs or taped concerts to trade (if you can stand vinyl-quality sound). Otherwise, use this as a last resort. Laura Joplin, if you're reading, please, we need another live collection, preferably 2-CD!!!! :-)"
2,save ur money.nothing special.,maybe 2 songs were good......... the rest nothing special. save ur money
1,No product,"It has been a month (30 days) since the order and we still haven't received it. An email a week ago got a curt we expoect our product to have gotten to us in about 14-16 days, and wait for the 30 days, and then we would get a refund if it hasn't arrived. Since this is a text being c used for a class a timely arrival was expected - and it was very disappointing. A replacement sent would have been an appropriate."
4,Rubber boot,"Item was as described. Can't see why they want so many words in the this description, as I said, it's a rubber boot."
2,"not really waterproof, not really winter plus","I have used my gloves when riding my bike at 30F and no rain and my fingers ended all red and hurting: not really warm for mild winter in Texas. I used my gloves when raining and, although I got to the end of my trip with my hands dry, when I got my gloves to do my ride back home they were wet inside. So, not really winter proof and not really water proof. I feel like I wasted my money and that this company has no problem making claims about their products which do not stand the simplest test. Very disappointed."
2,Check the size!,"I have large hands but measure out to an XL on the chart... these gloves in XL are way too small still. Also, the glove has a major design flaw in how the fingers are sewn together. The tip of each finger has about 1/4"" of material that is stiching that your finger rests behind. As a result of the thick seam, manual dexterity is severly limited. The glove is rather thin in general, I am not sure why the seam is so thick at the tip of the fingers, but it ruins the ability to push buttons easily with glove one."
1,Product came with a hole in the glove!,"The right hand glove had a 1/4"" hole or tear in the seam of the index finger. This wouldn't be that big of a deal if i was buying a cheap pair of working gloves, but these were supposed to be waterproof! I'll be trying a different brand next time."
1,Not good for small tasks,They Do keep your hands warm and dry. But they don't fit right like a lot of other people have said. there almost impossable to do small tasks with. But if you do get them make sure you buy a size up from your normal size.
4,Shipped to Wrong Address and Very Late,"It appears that the pacage was acually delivered on time just at a differnt address, not just two or three houses away, but an entire block away. My father's friend who recieved the package about a week and a half ago was on a vacation to Mexico. He gave me the package just today this moring 1/12/2013. The packaging was a little big, but it was not a big deal.Now to the glove quality is very good The padding arrangement on the palm side is perfect for flexiblity, but the fact that it make your hand feel like a marshmallo limits the potential. It keeps my hands warm and my hands are always cold. The only was that it is not watter proof if the water goes inside the glove through the wrist. :POveral it would have recieved a 5 if the delivery was not shipped to the wrong address"
2,Just Read.,"I gave it 2 stars because they are waterproof.As far as being warm, forget it. I needed a pair of warm, waterproof gloves for snow blowing in the northeast. We just got 10"" on snow, it was only 22 degrees and a bit windy, my snow blower is equipped with hand warming grips so my palms stayed warm. After only 1 hour outside my finger tips were so cold I couldn't feel them. I had to go back to my Thinsulate gloves, I was able to stayed snow blowing for at least 2 hrs however my hands did get wet.They also run small, if you take a XL glove they buy the XXL, it may or may not help keep the fingers warmer with more room to hold or create heat.I am going to try Thinsulate mittens and possibly ones that I can put warmers inside if they make them. If I fine a pair that works well I will add them to this review."
1,Janet B,I am not happy with this product at all. They claim to be waterproof and they are not at all. The gloves get wet on the inside and then the inside lining sticks to your fingers so when you pull your hand out of the glove the lining comes out. When you try to put them back on it is difficult to get the lining back in the right finger spots. I would not buy these again.
2,I returned them,"I ordered these gloves to use for work (I work as a rural mail carrier for USPS). I found them to be unsuitable for my purposes. They did seem to be waterproof, but they made my hands sweat like crazy. I had to leave my hand outside the vehicle just to keep from sweating so much. The gloves did not give me as much dexterity and were not as flexible as I expected. My search for a suitable glove continues."
2,Leaked in pinky finger picking up decoys.,"Just got these today and used them to put out and pick up decoys. Started out good. My hands stayed dry, warm and comfortable. Then while picking up I felt cold water coming through the pinky finger on the left hand. Really had my hopes up from the good reviews. Been looking all over for a good waterproof glove. About every pair I've ever tried has some kind of leak eventually. Guess I'll keep looking. Got a different pair of gloves ordered that are PVC coated hopefully they will do better. Even though the pinky leaks, I still may wear these for some things. Just not times where I might have my hand in the water. Would have gave them 5 stars if the pinky hadn't leaked. I might see if they'll send me another pair I don't know..."
2,Not too good for hunting,"I splurged and bought these, nearly $30 gloves thinking that they would keep my hands warm and be nibble enough to handle a rifle on my very first hunting trip in northern Arizona...well, lets put it this way, I wore those little cheap, stretchy - one size fits all gloves and they were way warmer. I even tried pre-heating them by placing them on the defroster in the jeep but to no avail. Sorry, but I think I keep them only because I feel guilty returning them because they have elk blood on them but they don't work at all."
3,Great for winter workouts with some caveats,"I got these to use during my winter workouts, as I exercise and they do a great job of keeping my hands warm for the most part. They stop working once the temperature gets below 16 degrees Fahrenheit. They're also really thick and make it difficult to get my hands in my pockets and to unscrew the top on my waterbottle."
2,Oddly proportioned,"I tried three different sizes of these gloves, L, XL and XXL. I couldn't even get the large on, and they were even too tight even for my girlfriend's fairly small hands. The XL were still too tight around my palms even though the fingers were very long. The XXL finally fit around my palms and were OK for my finger's girth but were so long that I could barely use them. I'm not sure what proportions a person needs to have to fit these gloves. They seem to be meant for someone with small palms, and skinny, very long fingers."
2,Not what advertised,"These gloves are NOT winter gloves. My ""Job Lot"" gloves costing $5.00 gives better warmth. They may in fact be waterproof, but I cannot say. Also the sizes run small so if you decide to try them, go to next larger size."
2,2 problems..,"These gloves do what they advertise, they are weatherproof and quite durable.. except, If you plan on putting them on & taking them off often.. you may, like i did.. have a hard time with the inner fabric (lining), apparently.. its just a thinner glove within the exterior glove.. it isn't attached to anything and just moves free, it tends to get turned inside out when you take your hand out and on a cold rainy day, trying to fight to get your fingers to fit back in is ridiculously hard, i wound up giving up and getting a less weatherproof glove to finish the job. also, cause of the inner lining not being attached to the finger tips, it leaves about half an inch of exterior glove hanging over your actual finger.. not a big problem but, feels very weird."
1,fingers still cold,"I bought these gloves with hopes of keeping my hands dry and warm dry they did but warm no . my fingers still froze .This was in our last snow storm the temp outside was just at 32 degrees, I was disapointed because of there claims"
3,Durable but not flexible,"I think these are a durable pair of gloves. It is sewn very well but movement is a bit restricted. For high dexterity gloves, I had expected more. If you are looking for more dexterity like I was, I would try a different pair."
3,Not great value for money,"Brand new these gloves feel amazing. Unfortunately I bought them to do winter tree work with. A couple non crucial seams in the back of the glove ripped within the first hour of work, revealing the water proofing material that wasn't much different from plastic shopping bags. Within a work week they were completely ruined. The similar gloves I've been getting from big box home improvement stores for $18 aren't as comfortable to wear but hold up a lot better and are a lot easier to get on and off. If you plan on wearing these for prolonged periods and doing no work they are fine but for working with or if you plan on taking them on/off a lot I'd look elsewhere."
1,Not waterproof,"I wasn't thrilled with the limited dexterity of these gloves but my main reason for purchasing them was the word ""waterproof"" in the description. Well tried them for the 1st time today and they are NOT waterproof!"
5,I bought this book many times to give as a gift to my best f,This book has been one of the best I have ever read.It has changed my life and the lives of many of my friends.I expect small miracles 3 and 4 and 5..
1,do not trust this author,"After reading Yitta Halberstam's HORRIBLY misguided article in the Jewish Press, I would never read or trust anything that she writes, even inspirational stories. She has shown herself to be superficial, and a terrible judge of character and contemporary Jewish issues.[...]"
1,Credit for Story,"Universal Publications should have been credited in this book for the use of our story about the priest whose life was saved when his pager went off in a vacant building. This story originally appeared in our book, There's No Such Thing as Coincidence which was featured on Oprah. In addition, it should be noted the quotes attributed to the priest in this story were totally fabricated by the authors, as they never interviewed nor contacted Father Mike while writing and/or researching their book."
1,not at all pleased,I am completely unsatisified. I never received the product. I contacted the seller. I never received a reply. I contacted Amazon and as of yet have not received a repy. I keep getting emails to rate the service and the product. I am am extremely fustrated with the whole mess and will not be purshasing anything through Amazon in the near future after this disaster
1,Not worth your time or money,"This CD was a terrible disappointment. The sound quality is awful - bordering on unlistenable. In fact, this CD should not even be for sale - it's that bad! Save your hard-earned money and avoid this one at all costs. As an alternative, I highly recommend the Japan '79 and Gabon, Africa '80 shows. Both are peak Marley shows featuring top-notch sound quality. Take it from someone who's been burned....."
1,SOUND OF TWO HANDS CLAPPING,"That should be the title of this album - the sound of two hands clapping. because that's basically all you can hear. and, the hands don't even belong to someone in the band. - d."
4,A decent kit of a Klingon ship,"This is really not a bad model... a reasonably accurate replica of the Klingon ""Bird of Prey"" ships from the Star Trek series.The wings can be built in either ""cruise"" or ""attack"" positions only. No provision for the ""landing"" mode is available in the kit, and the wing hinges are not functional... once you choose a wing position, you're stuck with it."
3,bird of prey review,model is easy to build but does have confusing instructions at the end of the manual. other wise it is a good model and i recommend others to build it
1,Misleading and disappointing,"The title of this video tape is very misleading ""V for Victory: Tarawa and the Island War"". Only about the first four minutes of this tape was about Tarawa, which I was very interested in. There were no details about the strategy of the landing, or any details. To me, this tape was just a waste of money and very disappointing. A really detailed, worthwhile tape about Tarawa can be ordered through Fox News - War Stories with Oliver North."
4,Her Best So Far,"This is SONiA's best studio CD. Her exceptional voice and thought-provoking lyrics are wonderfully complemented by the musiciams who accompany her on this album. Those who know her music and her style will hear a lot of songs that sound pleasntly familiar, such as the title song No Bomb is Smart and Obviously. But there is also a nice mix of new formats - from blues-bop on Bucket of Blues to pop-country on Ride This Ride. There is something for everyone - both long-time fans and new listerners. She does a wonderful job on this CD and I hope she explores more of these new genres in the future."
2,Hard to Wear,Got this as a gift for someone but they couldn't wear them easily and ended up giving them back. They sit now in a box of 'emergency' electronics. I thought the design was decent but wearing them did prove uncomfortable and just not something for every day use. If you have used or prefer the back of the neck headphones you probably will like these.
5,Gotta Have It-Best Bobby Vinton,"If you like Bobby Vinton, this is as close to going back as you'll ever get. A must have for every Bobby Vinton lover."
5,Wonderful,Bobby Vinton at his best. You will certainly enjoy his music and it will bring back fond memories. Thank you.
1,"cheap, not worth it","The fan broke after about 2 months. So it's obviously very cheaply built, spend that extra money on something with more quality."
1,Bearings are shot,The bearings are shot and its making a racket - it didn't even last 18 months in a lightly used computer.
5,"Pretty quiet, nice looking, and keeps my computer SUPER cool.","This fan is a great buy for what you get. It's sick looking for custom gamer pc's and it's super cool. it's also whisper-quiet. If they have a case fan I'll want to buy it as well that way i can have two quiet fans. It generally keeps my CPU temp pretty normal. The lock on mechanism worked perfectly too. No cheap parts here, quality stuff. The only bad thing i had to say was that this fan is pretty big. Do what i did and take the time to measure out the space on your MoBo for this fan and compare with dimensions on here, because it's a pretty big fan.Great fan, love it."
1,Garbage,"I received a bunch of workstations with these HSF units and in nearly every case the bearings in the fan have failed prematurely. Amazon used to sell the compatible Thermaltake Silent 939 K8 CL-P0200 which has a far superior fan, now it's been discontinued while they still sell this piece of garbage. Go figure."
3,Reliable & quiet. Good for the price.,"I have dual Opteron boards running these. Since the 939/940 socket series lasted so long, I had the chance to buy more of these heat sinks. No complaints. They are reliable, quiet and they work. For overclocking, you may want to consider something with heat pipes."
3,"Great, but first CD is better","I don't know what it is but for some reason I like the first cd better. It seemed like it had more fast and upbeat songs. My favorite songs on this album are ""Down for the get down"" and the first single ""Sugar."" The album totally rocks, and the guys are totally hot! So if you like hot guys singing hot music buy the cd, plus vote for Sugar on TRL and Radio Disney. You can find the guys on tour with Jessica Simpson. Go to (website) to find out more and listen to some tracks!"
