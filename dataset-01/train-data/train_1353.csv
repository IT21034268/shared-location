3,Almost 4 Stars,"I enjoy this light mystery series. I find Dorothy Martin interesting - mature, yet sometimes silly enough to make her not stuffy. This is the eighth in the series and one of the better ones. A schoolteacher's husband is killed and she, along with her young daughter, are having trouble coping with all the pressures that would go along with that. In steps Dorothy to help her both with the coping and with the solving of the mystery. Her investigation takes her a few times to London, which provides a break from the smalltown descriptions that normally accompany a book in this series. There were two reasons I did not give this book 4 stars: I was able to figure out the culprit long before the end of the book and I find the character of Dorothy's husband, Alan, a 2-dimensional character and wish he would be fleshed out a bit. But, this is a quite enjoyable read and I would recommend it, particularly to those that have read the earlier books in the series."
4,An entertaining read about an entertaining man.,"The majority of reviewers on LaVey's books usually fall into 3 categories; 1) Slobbering, groveling, worshipping followers of anything he said or did. 2) Pseudo-intellectuals trying placate their egos with supposedly intelligent perspectives on LaVey. 3) Slobbering, groveling, worshipping religious Jesus-junkies denouncing everything about LaVey. Why can't people just accept him for what he was; a colorful character with a brilliant philosophical outlook on life. Much can be gained by reading his views, but to make a religion out of it is the greatest trick he ever pulled off."
4,Interesting Read but without Truth!,"This book serves as an introduction to the Satanic philosophy and a ""biography"" of its illustrious founder, Anton LaVey. Do yourself a favor and dig up the 9/5/91 issue of Rolling Stone at your local library when you're done; it's well worth the effort. The author checked up on LaVey's supposed background and obtained some surprising results. Although, I still really enjoy his take on things."
2,&#65533;secret life&#65533; lacks secret spark,"To my disappointment, I did not find this book all that exciting. I muddled through it at a snail's pace. There isn't really any material presented here that is shocking or invigorating or interesting for that matter. LaVey has some cool individualistic view points but it's mostly just Nietzsche with some icing on top.So maybe real Satanism just isn't as firey as the media represents it. I guess I can live with this."
1,This book stinks and boring,"I thought this book was extremely boring and didn't pertain to the inforation on the outside cover. I didn't even get half way through and put it up. Gave it to my Mom to read, and she did the same thinng."
3,Unsatisifying,"Having heard many stories and rumours about Levey. I was looking forward to this book, dispelling the myth and revealing the real man. The book went someway to doing that, but not far enough as far as I am concerned, in fact it left me asking more questions than when I began. Despite that, it is well worth a read and well written. I think you will enjoy this, no matter what your personal beleifs are."
3,Anton LaVey - The Secret Life of a Satanist,"Interesting read to say the least. The man portrayed in the book had one of the most interesting lives ever. However, his entire childhood and most of his early adult life until the creation of the Satanic Church was complete fiction. It is ironic though that the man who was the representative of the Father of lies just happened to be an enormous liar."
2,Disappointing,"Too little is made of Lavey's uncanny physical similarities to Emperor Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon, and too much is made of his pseudo-intellectual spooky-talk and geographic origins for most. A black mass of disppointment for all but the biggest Lavey fans, I'm afraid."
1,Con Artist,"Hardly anything in this book is true. He was a con artist. He never worked for the circus, he never had an affair with Jane Mansfield. He used to beat his first wife and was cruel to animals. LaVey was an adroit liar. It is amazing that he duped so many people, like he said, ""a sucker is born every minute""."
3,"An interesting read, but take it with a pound of salt","This book serves as an introductin to the Satanic philosophy and a ""biography"" of its illustrious founder, Anton LaVey. Do yourself a favor and dig up the 9/5/91 issue of Rolling Stone at your local library when you're done; it's well worth the effort. The author checked up on LaVey's supposed background and obtained some surprising results."
2,booring,"Ill sum it up for you: looser guy starts a fake relegion that gives him an excuse to do whatever he wants and gets a band of other loosers to follow behind him. There, I saved you a hundred or so pages."
3,Great Read!,This was a good time read! Dispelled many misconceptions for me. Mind opening experience!
1,Delusional.,"As the other reviewers pointed out this is bad revisionism. The author is rewriting history, and lacks proof. The Celts are the bad joke of European society. This book won't change that."
3,iight,"This book of modern critical views provided thought-provoking insight to many, in fact nearly all, of Chopin's literary works, including her many short stories and two novels, the most critically acclaimed being The Awakening. The book helped me to look at Chopin's work with more respect and a totally new perspective and understanding. However, since I have not read all of Chopin's works, some of the analyses were difficult to comprehend, seeing as I had no background for assimulating the information into something coherent. All in all, the novel is a worthwhile read if one is interested in the wonderful works of Kate Chopin."
2,There are others that work better,"There are other peelers that work better...especially the part that is supposed to make the initial cuts into the skin. This one uses a very small plastic blade situated in the middle of the side of the instrument, which makes it difficult to ""sweep"", or manipulate around the circumference of the fruit.The ones that work the best are those that have an elliptical blade at the end of the instrument, and all you have to do is make an initial cut to get it under the skin and then simply pull it around the fruit."
2,Not what I expected,I was expecting a different peeler and this looked like it in the photo---sadly it was not the same. This does not really work well---very disappointing.
1,Sucks - straight up,"So, normally im pretty nice to the reviews, but please consider this one honest.First off, the seller is great, no problems, product arrived new, undamaged. Great seller.Product? Horrible. Couldn't get the orange open. Yeah it was $2, but it is a better shoehorn than orange opener.Don't waste your time. Get a better one."
5,Great center channel,I use this as a center channel in a 5.1 system in my living room. The voices sound clear and lifelike.
4,Thank God for these Guys!,"I have listed to DC Talk since the early days. I have bought every album as each has been released. All I can say is that I wish that this had been released years ago. It is encouraging to see these guys truly trying to please God through it all. It comes through in their music, and it comes through in this DVD: Toby, Mike and Kevin have their hearts on God and so should we."
4,Lifestyles like that at the Biltmore Estate throughout,"Families of Fortune is very good at depicting the rise to wealth and power that accompanied the businessmen of the Industrial Era in America. The Gilded Age homes and lifetyles are lavishly depcited, using hundreds of photos and basic, supporting text that will adequately portray the subject intended in the book. Overall, it is useful, but would not be helpful for a person trying to specialize solely on the well-known names of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, and others."
4,Fortunate Owner.,"I've owned this book for years and have enjoyed it very much. Informative, well researched, visually exciting. Much more than just a coffee table book. Very highly recommended."
5,Love it!,"This Swingline 440 (74440) hole punch is wonderful! Adjustable punch heads, replaceable punch heads when they get dull. And I can insert up to 7 total if I want. (Only ships with three, and new ones are $20 each, a bit expensive). I like this product because it is durable, heavy, powerful. I took this over the comparable 450 model (74450) because that one, by the online descriptions, can only go up to 4 punches, not 7. Complaints: well, it shipped with a bit too much oil on one of the punches, left ugly stains on the paper around the hole. I think after punching 1000 pages on scrap paper I have solved the problem. Actually, since I bought it used, maybe the manufacturer wasn't the one who put on too much oil."
1,Weak paper guide,"This model looks like a great, heavy duty three hole punch but the paper guide is very weak. It is very easy to miss the spot where the paper should lie and it is very easy to get the holes in the wrong places."
2,"Good product, but too small/tight","add at least an inch or two of girth, it was made for 15 year-old boys."
2,Some Pleasure,"Ordered to try and see if it would add any pleasure. Has a tight fit, but doesn't add much for male. Wife could sense some, but not something that we'll use often to enhance pleasure. Cost to ship was really not worht it."
1,Useless cheap soft rubber,"This is really not any better than a rubber band, the rings do not have enough power to hold the penis erect from slowing blood flow from escaping the penis, they are really useless."
1,for teenie weenies,"very disappointed with this purchase...photo inferred 3 sizes, all 3 rings were same size-too small, none would stretch to adequate dimensions...I even broke onemore a novelty than practical sex toy or erectile aid...I definitely do not recommend this item"
4,Great bedtime book,"This is a great book, but ...If I were looking at this book with a child, I probably would not read the text. Mostly, the text makes the image more limited and precise and inhibits the imagination.I love Gonsalves's work, but I have one quibble about that, too: the violin in the picture ""Listening Fields"" is being played backwards, with the bow in the left hand. I know that this probably fits better in the composition, but it is just plain wrong, and if I were looking at this book with a child, it would be hard for me not to mention it. It's like having a picture of a car where the driver sits in the back seat ..."
5,beautiful,Beautiful pictures and beautiful story. The more you look at the pictures the more you see in them.
4,MONSTROUS FUN,"If the youngster at your house has a sense of humor that tends to the ridiculously yucky (and what little boy's doesn't?), give him a copy of ""Food Fright.""He'll love such lines as ""Will it be the slime fondue, or eyeball stew for you?""In this totally hands-on for laughs collection of paper art we find 15 surprises as monsters are preparing for a delicious meal (if you can call it that). The book teems with spin wheels, pull tabs, touch-and-feel, scratch-and-sniff, and lift tabs. All to keep mischievous fingers busy.There is an amazing grand finale - monstrously fun!- Gail Cooke"
5,"Inspiration, the basis for reading - and writing - SF.","This book is the kind which should be judged not only for the value of its content, but also for the underlying message that it contains as a whole. In other words, it is more than just a collection of stories. As the reader finishes each tale, he or she should ask the question, ""Besides whether or not I myself enjoyed this story, what about it could have inspired someone to make the decision to become a writer of science fiction?"" Although some might make more critical evaluations, most people should find that each entry has a common answer: the author loved his work and wanted to convey that to the reader. ""Favorite"" is a very subjective word, and this book is absolutely subjective. No one will agree on every story being high quality, but everyone will agree that, somewhere, we all hold a science fiction story dear to our heart. This book is good reading, if only for the joyful presentation of the genre."
2,Extreme Irritability,"I can't say whether it is the quality of the compound, or whether I'm just sensitive to ALCAR, but this made me very irritable even at 1\4 tablet. No benefits to report at all."
1,This book makes the female form boring,"This book must have literary merit that is beyond me, but I don't understand the reviews it has been getting.The book is about what this guy does when he stops time. While most of his activities he does are sexual in nature, they come across as very bland.I left this book thinking, here is a guy who has the power to stop time, and yet, I can not imagine a life that is more boring then his."
2,"Read ""The Mezzanine"" instead.","I came to love Baker's writing when I read ""The Mezzanine."" The writing is still good here, and the concept is interesting, but the book gets more and more relentlessly pornographic as it goes on until it seems quite overdone. So I can't recommend it."
5,Profane yet Profound,"The Fermata is one of my favorite books.I read things in this book that I never thought I ever would, including some of the most graphic--but exceptionally creative!--sex scenes ever written, not to mention some of the most inventive unique words for body parts and sex acts. I also discovered passages filled with startling honesty, loneliness, and desire for creation.The Fermata isn't perfect. Some scenes are a little too long winded, especially near the end (Marion the Librarian just doesn't know when to quit), but there's no denying that the book bursts with imagination and a refreshing lack of restraint that I rarely see. There are certain passages I have flagged and flip to every now and again to re-read and experience. Because of that, I have to give the book five stars and an eternal place on my bookshelf."
3,"Great writing, fails to find a theme.","I loved The Fermata's first half. Fine writing, great control of tone and voice. God, what a voice. Charming, erudite, witty. Delightful. But then the novel becomes more and more pornographic. It goes from a modern version of Henry Miller to a modern version of The Story Of O. The character writes a series of X-rated stories to seduce women. The first one is witty and funny, but they get more explicit and more heavy handed as the story progresses. Ultimately the novel fails to find a theme. Nicholson Baker is a fine technician writing well, but he doesn't really understand what he's writing about, so he slaps a kind of hokey ending on and calls it quits. I was very disappointed in the end."
4,"Yes, but it's very good pornography","Baker has taken a popular adolescent fantasy and given it a first rate treatment. Even he admits, in interviews, that he found it embaressing to publish. I found myself skipping large bits.But it is indeed well written, and the perfect thing to read in a waiting rood, a stck elevator or anywhere else time seems to have come to a halt."
5,#1 Fan,"Baker makes me laugh and think and wish I could write as he does. He's the only author I've ever written a fan letter to. I've read everything he has written, and what I find most remarkable, beyond his masterful command of language, is his unabashed love of women. Baker is one of the few modern writers who loves and likes women. So even though he never responded to my fan letter, I will continue to buy everything he writes (in hardback) and lend his books to anyone I can get to borrow them. By the way, his U and I is the best homage to John Updike ever written."
5,A thrilling novel mixing high and low,"The Fermata is an amazing novel by an extraodinarily gifted writer; all the sex and hoop-la can't distract from the innovative vantage point that is Nicholson Baker's. Perhaps the most gratifying thing about the novel is its eagerness to mix the highbrow (technique, language), and the lowbrow (pornographic subject matter), herein resembling Nabokov's Lolita. The Fermata is a tour de force of comic execution, displaying a rare shrewdness and tenderness. Baker's use of language is simply astonishing: the musicality of his prose is particularly delightful. A hugely gifted stylist, Baker is a writer who has an almost magical ability--he enchants and charms like no other."
4,Very Entertaining,"Any male conscious of his daydreams realizes that he has many fleeting erotic desires, harmless save for stigmaticism and inpracticality of fulfillment. This book, giving the protagonist the ability to stop time, explores fulfilment of these modest though eccentric seeming fantasies. The ethics and value of aesthetic fulfilment are explored in a very entertaining and comprehensive manner in this novel. It makes for an enjoyable read."
4,good little book,"The Bible from Scratch was recommended to us by the pastor of another church who began a small group study using it as the text and was very pleased at reactions to the book; so we've begun a small group and are very satisfied. It is non-threatening for folks who have no special background in reading or studying the Bible and doesn't come on ""too strong"" or too demanding. We started with the Old Testament and hope to continue on with the new Testament volumn."
2,Great price,"This is a MUST READ for American Industrial Designers, Engineers, Architects and Entrepreneurs. Though it is primarily used as an academic text, I have only ever been able to borrow it from my local library. It was in heavily used condition (which was not said in the ad) but I am happy to finally own it. This history is important to know and understand. I looked at the inside cover and saw that the book was the property of a public library. I sure hope it wasn't stolen and resold."
4,one of Martin's best books,"I loved this book when I was nine years old because I really looked up to the title character, Kammy Whitlock, a confused twelve-year-old with a widowed father. At the time, I didn't know anyone who had had to live in a stepfamily, so I was very interested in how Kammy got along with her stepmother and stepsister and baby stepbrother. I also had had a bad experience with camp, and it was reassuring to know I wasn't the only one who would rather be at home reading a book than in a camp full of snotty girls who were always mean to me. This is a cute, engaging story that's great for an afternoon read."
3,It attracts fish! but mainly Jelly Fish!!,"after 4 hours, it attracted all of the jelly fish in the sea! at least that proves that its not only green annoying light in the middle of the water!another comment is that the wire is kinda short!"
3,It isn't the best concert of the Scorpions,"It isn't the best concert of the Scorpions. It looks like Klause was trying his hardest to perform good on stage but it still wasn't very good. In the vhs World Wide Live, in the DVD Moment of Glory and Acoustica, he seemed more relaxed which makes the performance a lot better. It is still enjoyable though. If you are a really BIG fan of the Scorpions, I would recommend this DVD."
1,Nothing useful,"I got this book because I thought by the subtitle that it would have some useful information on what I have planned to do--stay at home with my child. Instead, this book spends its first 70 pages stating over and over why feminists are wrong, why the media is wrong, etc. It is repetitive and not very accurate. It also assumes the reader has not made up her mind about the benefits of staying at home with children and needs to be convinced.The author finally gets into vague tips on saving money and working at home, but nothing unique. Instead she recommends reading books like Tightwad Gazette, or books on how to start a home business. If you really want to help your child, take the money you would have spent on this book and treat your child to some educational toys instead."
4,"Good Price, does the job.","Pros: Tells me where north is. Good suction cupsCons: Flimsy, a little slow.I gave this 4 stars mainly because of its price and functionality. ( the build quality is quite cheap )I have been looking for a compass to put on my car and most were in the 40 dollar range.This was exactly what I was looking for. It sticks right on your windshield and tells me where I am going. You need a philips screw driver to tighten the compass up so it doesnt sag down on the window. If it sags down the compass wont work because it need to be elevated in order for the N/S/E/W to turn, otherwise it hits the side and cant move.The suction cups looked cheap, but are actually really good. There is a small delay when I turn the car and for the compass to catch up.All in All. I would buy it again. Except this is shipped from another retailer (not amazon). I just wished I bought 2 so I could have saved on the shipping price."
1,no sense of direction,"this compass spun around and around and never gave a proper direction. first you'd be east, then suddenly north, then west. drastic changes, based on nothing. i threw it out."
1,Look for something better!!,"It is still undecided as to the exact way to point. I have tried adjusting it but to no avail, try looking for something more effective and accurate."
4,Dashboard Compass,"It took a few tries to adjust the compass to read the correct headings, but after I got it to work properly, it's a pretty cool gadget to have in my car."
2,Stopped working less than 2 years down the road,"I bought it for $6 I believe at Advanced Auto Parts or a similar store. It worked fine for nearly 2 years (I drive once a week short distance only) and now I noticed the oil level went down (without leaking) and it stopped working. So it's ok as a short term compass, but not recommended for advanced user that want a long lasting compass. I will be searching to buy a better quality, more expensive compass now. Bought one for $10 made by BELL. Will see how it will work. If not, will look for a top notch compass for my car. So, this one made by Airguide is ok for one year or so. Therefore just short of 3 stars since $6 in poorer countries is what people make per day or even per week and since this has been made in one of the poor(er) countries, it should probably cost more like $2 to $3 if it lasts just a year or two."
2,I've gone through three,"It is hard to find an analog compass for a car because the heat of the dash trashes them. They spring leaks, jam, and generally fail. I had a Ritchie marine that lasted a couple years. The Airguides I've bought failed pretty quickly."
3,"Just OK, but Cheap","I bought this as a low cost marine compass for kayaking. My requirements are limited - no adjustment is needed for sheet metal, automotive electronics, etc. I deeply sympathize with all the reviewers who had issues with 'truing' the compass using the internal calibration feature. I ultimately removed the magnetic compensators so I could at least get a reliable reading based on 'magnetic north'.For purposes of providing an indication of direction, standing up to salt water and not breaking the bank, it works just fine. If I was concerned about precision or durability, I'd be inclined to pay (much) more for another product."
2,says commercial but very cheaply designed,i bought this to replace my cuisinart coffee maker..... what a mistake.... the only reason why i bought it is because it says commercial. this is not a commercial coffee maker... i should have figured that out with the price also. it is very poorly built... is all plastic if you move it the wrong way it will brake no doubt about that. the coffee resevoir spills out coffee when pouring and after pouring it drip. this did not last 1 week i returned it. thanks to amazons great return policy i had no problems and got my money back.
3,Auto turn off breaks,"I really liked this coffee maker for the 6 months I've had it. However, the auto turn off stopped working and you have to remember to turn it off now."
4,Love it!,This coffee maker is great! I've had it for 6 years now and not one problem. It's easy and mess-free. I gave it 4 stars b/c you have to make a full pot of coffee or it is too diluted. It also could use an auto feature.
5,More than a martial artist,"For a man of 32 years, it is amazing how much Bruce Lee accomplished. This video gives you insight into a philosopher who read over 3,000 books (he would have loved Amazon!), created a new martial art, wrote his own books, and kick-started a new film genre. He lived his life as fast as his kicks and punches."
2,very disappointed,"after reading the famous book by Axel Munthe , which we loved . i decided to buy this film hoping to learn more about him and his time spent on Capri. This film is more about an American journalist who goes to visit San Michele , little is learned about the doctor . It is short and the woman narrating is meloncholy and almost depressing , the picture in places is grainy and looks like it was copied from a video. Cant understand the other review of 5 stars , the deciding factor for buying. The only good point in this film/documentary is your given a tour of the villa , tho no mention is given to the famous site it was built on."
3,Mixed Blessing,"Eric Griffin did a great job on the Get of Fenris. Gherbod Fleming MUST BE STOPPED before he writes again--unfortunately he's scheduled to do Wendigo *and* Uktena. Once again, the American Indians suffer. But the Silver Fangs get him too, so it's not a culture-bias.I enjoyed GOF tribe novel--it was witty, fast-paced, occasionally thoughtful, and once or twice laugh-out-loud funny. Some of White Wolf's best fiction!Gherbod Fleming, unfortunately, writes like a high school creative writing student--dull and uninteresting, thick with adjectives and cliche'd phrases, painfully pretentious and charmed with his own style--bleah. What more can I say than ""Mountain-like in their midst was Dawntreader, his platinum hair reflecting the red flames, whipping hither and yon as he danced"" (p35)?If anybody can figure out a way to give White Wolf money for Get of Fenris and *not* for Shadow Lords, drop me an e-mail. The pattern persists in Silent Striders/Black Furies."
5,werewolf,"An excellent book, very easy to read, and deep characters. Very recommend for the fans of NWOD or WOD. A must have for your collection"
5,Finally!,"At long last! Finally some WtA writing. I have been starving for some decent fiction since Call to Battle, Silver Crown and Breathe Deeply. Although I am not much of a shadow lord fan it was good writing, and I really liked the Get of Fenris. Can't wait to see what the next books will be like."
1,Waste of Time,"I simply cannot accurately say how terrible this book is. I am a big fan of the Werewolf: The Apocalypse/Rage franchise and I have read 4 books previous to this but I am sorry to say this one is bad, bad, bad.It's like the author knew loads about the World of Darkness and went into crazy, over-description on this to make up for the fact that there is simply no story or decent dialogue. I am surprised I even managed to make this much out as it is so badly written little sense can be made from every single page.No plot or story really kicked in at all. If you have read the 'When Will You Rage' book you will be able to understand how good short stories with likeable characters work. None of that is present here. It's simply an absolute mess. I was considering reading the rest of the books in this series but now I will really have to reconsider if this is the going to be the typical standard.If you like this franchise then read 'The Silver Crown' or 'Breathe Deeply' for cool Rage stories."
3,Intresting......,"To start things off, This story was right up my alley. I loved the content and it kept my attention(most of the time),however this book explains to me why it is best to wait untill you have nothing more to live for before pledging your heart and soul to one particular person. The distrust and lack of maturity that is portrayed through the charecters of the book proves to me that ""love"" in no more then a clumsy, aweinspiring, temporary departure from reality. I enjoyed reading the letters even though frequently I had to make sure I haden't lost my place in the book because it seemed as though I was reading the same thing over. I really enjoyed reading the authors comments the most. All and all the book kept my attention and I enjoyed many parts to it. I give the author mad props and am impressed with his work. Good Job S.G Good Job!"
1,Over-priced junk!,"This seemed like a wonderful idea and an excellent Christmas gift. The package arrived promptly and undamaged.But when my wife opened the product lid for the very first time, THE ENTIRE TOP PANEL CAME OFF IN HER HAND!!!!There were two wood screws that literally fell out of the holes ( which were apparently too big for the screws since there was no sign of screw threads on the sides of the holes ) and half a dozen tiny little nails about the thickness of a standard staple.My wife has MS and no longer has the muscle strength in her hand or arm to damage anything.This product is just plain cheaply made. It would be too expensive at $6; at $60 it qualifies as Grand Theft.We are huge fans of Amazon and have bought thousands of dollars of products through them. But this product is a complete failure and is being returned. If I could give it Zero stars, I would."
4,What a CD!!!,"When i recieved this CD as a gift, i was a little skeptical. I wasn't really that much of a fan. But after listening to the 1st track....I was HOOKED! This CD features some absolute classics. I have to say that the re-mastering REALLY makes a difference, especially to 'Baby come Back' and 'Electric Avenue'. I would recommend this CD to people who LOVE good, late 80's-style, music even if they aren't, necessarily, Eddy Grant fans. I wasn't, but I am now!"
5,Showcases Grant's catchy blend of pop and reggae with hits from 1977 to 2001,"Eddy Grant is one of the giants of the reggae genre. The unique late Seventies and Eighties sound will bring back memories of lazy, sunny days.This album succesfully showcases his foot-tapping , feel-good music with tracks such as the disco-beat Electric Avenue in both the 1982 original and the 2001 Ringband Remix. The laidback I Don't Wanna Dance (1982) , Can't Get Enough of You (1981) and Do You Feel My Love (1981) , the Afro-Carribean jamboree Hello Africa (1977), the jiving Latin Love Affair (1982) , the fast-paced Nobody's Got Time (1977) the call for an end to African civil wars , Living On The Frontline (1979), the energetic Killer On the Rampage (1982) and the Hip-Hop style Ten Out of Ten (2001). If you like music that makes you fell good, this album will get you hooked on Eddy Grant's fantastic reggae-pop blend."
5,a journey to guyana,This is an excellent book in terms of historical and geographic factors in guyana.The ethnic and cultural differences of the people in Guyana was written clearly.
3,best band ever??,"Both concerts from early 80s just fair video quality,the band get nothing from the sale of this dvd.see their website."
3,complex,"I think if you are an organized and disciplined person this book is probably good for you. Being as depressed as I am, I am not motivated and this book takes a lot of focus and special diet, vitamins, etc. I can't do all this."
2,Mis-Named,This book offers some excellent nutritional advice in dealing with physical illnesses that mimic the symptoms of depression. It also addresses dietary factors that would lead your body to exibit depressive symptoms.This book however does not live up to its title. It fails to throughly and accurately take into account the different types and degrees of depression.This book gives great ideas of things to try and questions to ask you doctor in regards to things that might need to be ruled out however this is not a good resource as to how to manage depression. A book which was more helpful was The Feeling Good Handbook.
3,Credibility suffers with style!,I bought the book this week but I found that I could not get past all of the exclamation points!!! which made it seem like an infomercial hawking the Center and the book itself. There seems to be plenty of solid advice but the constant insult of exclamation points made it impossible for me to take seriously.
1,"If you're into mega doses of vitamins, several times a day..","I bought this book on Friday, read it over the weekend, andreturned it on Monday. I just can't see tying myself to takingmegadoses of expensive vitamins several times a day - just trying to remember when to take what would be stressful! There were a few goods points, which is why I gave the book one star, but for the most part I was totally unimpressed. Also, some of the recommendations were disturbing - tryptophan is available only by prescription for a reason. Save your money!"
5,Good tool for translators!,After reviewing this book at a public library I decided to buy it along with Volume two because it is a good tool for translators and for others in general. It is complete and concise. It is definitely a great dictionary.
5,"""Original Version"" actually a new production, too","This CD maxi-single contains 4 great dance remixes (especially the Fresca Boys mix), but track one, listed as ""Original Version"" is actually an all new production in a modern reggae style that is completely different from the original Lee Perry production that appears on the US version of the album""One Love: The Very Best Of..."". It's at the original tempo,and I'm sure it uses the same vocal track, but it's got all new backing and is very nicely done and highly enjoyable."
2,adidas capri pants,"The material is ""clingy"" Hard to describe..they feel funny when walking.I ordered two others (adidas capris) that were perfect in every way! I think this material is like a rain slicker??? Make sure to look at the material info."
5,Excellent Songwriter,"Steven Zelin is one of the really talented new songwriters coming out of New York. Frequently funny, other times warm and heartfelt, there are a wide range of emotions on this cd, with beautiful guitar playing. My favorites are ""Bagel Store"" and ""Golden Shoulder"". ""Island of Manhattan Blues"" is funny, and SO VERY TRUE for anyone living in the city. A really good debut album from a great new artist."
2,Not for Samsung Galaxy Nexus,I bought this to try and get an edge in Draw Something. Unfortunately it works horribly on the screen that comes with the Galaxy Nexus. You have to tap relatively hard on the screen upon first contact for the screen to recognize the pen. I prefer not to break my phone so this went into the junk drawer.
4,GREAT PROJECT FOR A 5 YEAR OLD,"I bought this for my granddaughter, who loves to do craft projects. She loved putting the decorations on the bag and needed help only with the the ribbon bow. The bag is on the small size but worth the price"
1,No Instructions?,"I may be abysmally stupid, but I cannot figure out how to work this thing. It seems stuck in a locked position and I've nearly broken it twice trying to release the arm so it can punch holes. There are no instructions whatsoever."
1,Not that powerful,I wish I didn't purchase it. It's not as strong as I thought it would be (given the level).It's obviously quite big and hard to store also.
5,Amazing,"This is probably one of my favorite recent office buys. I had an old metal one that hurt my hand to use and would get things stuck in it and sometimes I had to use 2 hands for more paper. This one works so easily and I can use it with one hand with no problem even with tons of paper. When punching just a few pages, it is as easy as pressing down on a door handle, you hardly know that you have done anything. Also, it locks down so that it doesn't take up as much vertical space when storing which is also very nice. Again, though it seems trivial, this thing was totally worth it and is so easy to use."
3,Okay for a while,"This hole punch worked fairly well for a while (perhaps 1500 pages of punches), though I was never very successful when approaching 20 pages. Since then, one of the punch heads has needed to be pushed by hand toward the rest of the unit while the punch is being operated. And now I am unable to get one of the other heads to retract; hence, the punch is unusable until I replace that head or buy a better unit.The handle is nice, however."
2,"Worked for a while, then failed","This hole puncher worked for about 6 months and then failed. The outer puncher's spring popped out, leaving the punch to be ineffective (would not go back up after a punch due to the spring being out and jammed in). I suggest trying the Carl or Sparco brands of hole punchers if you are looking for increased guarantee of durability over the long run. I am sure this defect is not 100% prevalent but this problem does not seem to be uncommon so I would stay away from these."
4,Works great!,Works great. Changes for size of spacing between holes. Would prefer sliding verses the screws. Biggest drawback is the handle and the space it takes up.
5,Great Paper Punch,Great Paper punch. I have less trouble with this kind of punch to get papers in consistently straight. Great investment.
1,Came up during a search for a 7-hole punch....,This is NOT a 7-hole punch and cannot be used to punch the correct holes for a 7-hole datebook. Do not purchase this unless you want a basic 3-hole punch.
1,don't plan to use this case for any ACTIVE sports!,A disaster. This case is horrible for any sports that include movement beyond liesurely walking - having a heavy piece of plastic hanging from a string around your neck while running is very annoying -- but not nearly as much so as the fact that the buttons on the Shuffle don't work every time you try to operate it through this case.I hope I'm going to be able to return this and replace it with a useful product -- like a waterproof armband -- branded by someone other than Apple -- and maybe even priced to correspond to its value. What a disappointment!!
2,control buttons fell off,"I bought this particular item recently. On the second day of using the Shuffle Case, the white rubber control button on the Case fell off while I was in the grocery store. I'm pretty disappointed. Then, I phoned Apple to have it replaced or fixed. And, I couldn't get through Apple's customer services easily. I was disconnected from their customer service. So, I had to phone Apple again. Over all, just for this tiny product, I wasted quite a bit of time.I recommend that we can live without it."
3,not necessary,"Case is only necessary in extreme enviornments- beach, etc. IPOD is fine at the gym and skiing without it"
2,can't review the product,"I cannot review the product. Unfortunetally it never arrived at the given address. I sent several mails to the seller (don't remember the seller's name now), but never got the product received."
4,Sport case is durable...but sort of inconvenient,"Not a lot to say about this plastic safety case for the shuffle. It seems durable. Heavy-duty cord means the shuffle isn't falling off. The only down-side (other than the price...a lot for plastic..but what option?) is this: You must open up the case each time you want to turn the shuffle on and off. Not tragic. But sometimes...especially as I'm walking out of the gym...I forget to turn off the thing. You can, however, adjust both the volume and song order without opening the case. Bottom line: If your shuffle is going to take a beating, this is a good insurance policy."
5,IPOD Shuffle Sport Case,"I bought the sport case about a month ago in hopes of keeping my shuffle from behaving erratically during my long runs. Sweat would seep into the small cracks and make the shuffle impossible to use. With the sport case, I no longer have to worry about that. It is very well constructed, does add a little weight to the overall package (but not much), and can even let you run in the rain with no problem. It's a great buy!"
4,Great idea,"This a great idea for all those fitness fanatics that still go out in the rain. Like scuba diving housings for cameras it has a lubricated rubber seal and snaps shut puling the casing together providing a really good seal. There's also a rubber seal around the headphone jack, so no water getting in there either. This is a great casing but its one downside is the fact that it doesnt have the option to add a clip to it. It would be hard to go running using this but is excelling for cycling or walking where you can wear it round your neck or place in your back pack.All in all its really good holder."
4,iPOD hecklace,"I love this thing, granted it is ridiculously overpriced and should come with the shuffle when you buy it, but get real this is Apple, but the case itself is perfect it protects your shuffle and it is easy to open and close..one caviat..the ear buds tend to come out of the unit when you are doing an intense workout, but that's really no big deal, it's easy to plug back in, if you buy a Shuffle, I highly recommend you getting this, it's worth it to protect your investment, though the Shuffle is tougher than the ridiculously fragile Nano, it will break, so the cost of this is cheaper than a replacement cost, verdad?"
3,cute but not quite up to challenge,"In terms of design, this case is very well done. It keeps iPod safe and well protected.I wish though it came in more colors.I bought this to wear during my gym routine. It's fine for lifting weights or walking, but not really good for running or aerobics - it goes all over the place. Pretty annoying."
2,cheap&cheesy,"This movie is a big laugh.The director tried to shock big time but failed miserably.It's more a cheap soft porn movie than anything else.It probably was banned because it is so boring.Hardly any guts or gore just cheesy statements,trying to offend.A total failure."
1,Banning this was good,"Hey, don't let the words of ""controversy"" and ""banned"" lure you into even wasting your time with this piece of junk. And don't let all the negative reviews lead you towards the conclusion that ""it's so bad, it's good."" Don't get suckered in like me. The only controversy that I can justify is how did this ever get financed in the first place? And how did it generate such a cult following... enough so that it gets a DVD release in front of more deserved titles like THE DEVILS, QUICK CHANGE, ABBY, BLACULA, etc.Do yourself a favor and DON'T waste your money on this disc. There are a million better discs available right here that you will be happy that you bought. Buy THE EXORCIST for a real movie that provides scares, controversy and has it's own history of censorship and banning."
2,This film blows bigtime,"After watching the film it was obvious why so many countries would want to ban this film. It's not because of the violence, sex, or perversions that are depicted in the film but because the film is such crap that viewers may be inclined to exact bodily harm upon whomever was responsible for their having sat through this piece of sheet. Nothing at all about this film is shocking or disturbing; remotely comical perhaps, but certainly not worthy of having a reputation. The acting and the dialog was some of the worst I have ever seen. In fact, I only give this movie a few stars because I sort of liked the music. Don't waste your time with this worthless excuse of a movie. I guarantee you'll be disappointed."
1,Painfully amateurish...,"This flyblown wreck of a movie has actually garnered appreciative write-ups on several genre websites, precisely why remains a mystery to this reviewer. It's a real horse race as to which is more jaw-droppingly awful, the ""acting"" or the ""special effects"", the former consisting of badly coiffed sleazoids either swallowing their lines or reciting them in grating monotones, the latter limited to a few unconvincing dollops of garish red paint. One scene involving death by paint asphyxiation is particularly laughable, the paint is so unconvicingly subbed for by whole milk it renders the entire escapade moot. This is a real backyard yawner...Where are you Niko Mastorakis, and would you consider sending me a personal check to cover the cost of this DVD?"
1,What is this?,"I am embarassed to say I watched the entire film expecting that there must be a big laugh at the end. There is not. The laugh must have been on me. Embarassing is the best thing I can say about this creative effort. A compost heap is more creative. There is nothing, from any point of view, here. Only see this if you have nothing, nothing left in the world to do."
4,Great reference book from the older days!,This book was authored by a US Congressman in the 1950s who was also a medical doctor. This book is a great reference to see how routine health situations can be handled at home without need for constant trips to the medical establishment.I give this book 4 stars simply since it is written in an age gone by and should be republished in larger print. It was difficult for a family member to read who has some relatively minor vision impairment.
1,Why did they change Vanilla Almond?!?!,"I use to love these bars! My husband and I ate them every day. We just got the ""new recipe"" and boy, am I disappointed! Why did you change them? They are not as good now."
3,Great Product that suffered some heat damage in shipping,I LOVE these Luna bars and was happy to be able to have them shipped to my house in this quantity at this price. I do believe that they suffered heat damage during shipping. They are not as fresh as if I had bought them at the store. Part of the bar has cracked off and they have a bit of a different texture. I will not buy again in this way. I will just go to the store.
4,So good!,"Of all the Luna bars that I have tried so far (which is several), this flavor is definitely my favorite. Very tasty. There are only a couple of flavors that I would buy a whole box of - this one is at the top of that list."
2,We don't like these,I bought these based on good reviews. We don't like them. The flavor is artificial. They are too sweet.
2,Not that impressed,I like the original Luna bars. I don't eat them all the time but I do like to grab an occasional one as I'm heading through the checkout instead of junk food. I really like the Lemon Zest. I wasn't as impressed with the Sunrise bars. They are much chewier than the original. The flavor is not as good. My husband and I are pretty much eating them now just to get rid of them. We won't be purchasing this kind again.
2,ick!,"While I love that the Sunrise bar is a little bigger (but less dense, maybe?) than the ordinary Luna bars, the taste and texture of this one is off! It's less noticable when you're consuming it in addition to something else--coffee, for example--but when you eat it by itself you realize how nasty the taste is! I'll stick to my usual Nuts & Chocolate, thank you."
2,Outright Bad,"I thought these bars would be a great way to grab breakfast and run... I was wrong. The Blueberry Yogurt bars are awful. Would recommend purchasing the oatmeal raison, they are much better..."
3,Luna Sunrise Vanilla Almond Flavor,"This is an OK bar. The flavor takes some getting used to and would not be my first choice in the future. (Not that it's bad, just not my thing.)It does tide me over until lunch when I eat it as a sanck after breakfast."
5,I Love These Bars!!,"I eat a Luna Sunrise Bar every morning for breakfast (Apple Cinnamon is my favorite). They are fiber and protein packed so it keeps me full until lunch. I love that they are 70% organic and don't use hydrogenated oils or high fructose corn syrup. I'm not wild about Vanilla Almond but do trade off between the other three flavors. Of all of the breakfast bars on the market, these are one of the healthiest, flavorful, and filling that I've tried."
4,Luna sunrise bars are great,"I have not been able to hold any real food down recently, so getting my nutrition any way I can is key. I tried the Luna Sunrise Strawberries & Cream bar this morning after buying it at Whole Foods for 99 cents (regular price). The bar was really tasty and hit the spot. I am going to order some more bars right away."
4,luna bar gets better,Luna has cut the fat content and increased the fiber in these bars. They are delicious and good for you. I enjoy one with a cup of tea and it fills me up for hours. Blueberry Yogurt is good too but this is my favorite.
5,Delicious nutrition for on-the-go,"I really enjoy the Vanilla Almond flavor of Luna Bars for delicious nutrition when I'm on-the-go and don't have time to stop to eat something healthy. They have a low glycemic index, so they digest slowly and that keeps you feeling sated. I bought them here on Amazon because this is cheaper per bar than I can buy them locally."
4,New to Nutrition Bars,"I've tried other nutrition bars in the past including Luna and couldn't get past the first bite. I decided to try them out again and thought I'd give Luna another shot. The Strawberry & Crumble Sunrise bars are actually pretty good. I was able to eat the whole thing and even enjoyed it. Looks like I found one I can start purchasing!You can pick up individual bars at Target. Try them before you buy a big pack, even if they say ""New York Cheesecake with Carmel sauce!"" :)"
3,Tasty but too sweet,"I always enjoyed the regular Luna bars. They taste like dessert but are more nutritious, so you feel like you're eating total junk but are actually getting some good out of it. But all of the regular line are too sweet for breakfast, so I was excited to see the Sunrise bars. I don't eat much for breakfast, and I prefer savory breakfast foods when I do eat a big breakfast.These were disappointing for breakfast; I think this particular flavor is even sweeter than some of the regular line Luna bars. I feel like I can smell how sweet it is as soon as I open the wrapper. They're still tasty--much better than every other nutrition or meal replacement bar I've tried. They're a good snack mid-afternoon, just not for me for the first thing I'm eating for the day."
2,The pointless pointe book,"I was disappointed to read an entire book on pointe and come away with so little. Poor discussion of shoe fitting, virtually no discussion of pointe technique, and only one figure/diagram in the whole book."
4,The pointe book,"I have found this book very interesting to read, and somewhat helpful. The book is American based which means that not all the information is relevant to an Australian reader such as myself. The second half of the book presents detailed pointe classes which are very helpful, but if you are not familiar with all the terminology you will need a ballet dictionary to use the information. Over all I have found this book interesting and helpful from a student point of view but also think it would be a good read for anyone who loves ballet."
3,"Used it, gave it away.","This is a good book for people who know nothing about pointe shoes, who need information for research, or for teachers. However there is so much unneeded information for the beginner student that it was overwhelming for me. There are better books out there. Not to say this one isn't good, but there are better ones."
4,A Mayan Find!,"Finally! After searching high and low and spending too much money on what proved to be books of limited assistance, this book gives a good introduction to the ways of Mayan life on the Yucatan, basic language instruction and valuable explanations of Mayan culture! For a great intro to the Maya of the Yucatan at a great price, look here!"
1,Madonna: The Name of the Game,Repeative video clips of Madonna; not a lot of variety. They must have showed the Madonna & Michael Jackson video clip four times! Too expensive and low quality.
2,Looks great and works great....until the warranty expires,"Looks great, and when it works it works well. But I had two units fail on me within a year.The unit I originally bought was DOA, but after an inspection by a service technician revealed that the coolant had completely leaked out, Haier replaced it. The replacement unit was a refurbished unit which seemed to have some damage on the bottom. But it worked fine, until it failed almost exactly one year later, too late to be covered under the warranty!I liked the looks of the unit, and the digital readout is a real boon--if nothing else, it helps to tell you when the unit stops working. :-)But I don't think the headache, and the hours I spent on the phone, are worth it. I'll look for another brand next time."
1,I have never rated anything this low!,"I agree with other reviewers who were disappointed....extremely poor hinge design....in fact, mine arrived with the door off the hinges. There was no visable damage to the packaging....which was in was minimal. The ""leveling"" wheels were bent and not effective and a piece was missing from the left lower corner. I would have paid 4X the price for a well designed appliance with appropriate packaging. Too bad, I will never know whether the cooling device worked well or not....this is going to the curb side tomorrow to be haulded to the junk heep!"
1,Beware -,"This product seemed to be an excellent buy. But unless you can actually pick it up in person, there is a much higher than average chance that your product will arrive at your door damaged. As previous reviews have mentioned, the packaging is inadequate for a product that requires a little care in shipping. I am shocked by the lack of packaging used. Do you really need the pain of returning it?"
4,Learning Latin by Richard Prior,"The author explains the structure of the Latin language utilizing wordsin the singular, plural, present tense, past tense and various otherforms germane to the Latin language. For instance, endings in ""s"" pertainto the singular; whereas, ""tis"" pertains to the plural. The word ""plane""means evenly. Planius means rather evenly and Planissime means amazinglyeven.Certain words utilized in English have Latin roots. i.e.o ceterao habitato ad hoco memorandumThis volume would be excellent to assist in vocabulary building forstudents of Latin or English literature."
3,Latin Is Hard,"Learning Latin from a book is really hard...The book is well written, and I'm sure it's helpful if you already know a little Latin."
3,Had it's moments...,I really wanted to love this show since I am an Arrested Development fan. Running Wilde had potential but sadly it didn't live up to it. It did though have some hilarious moments and the storyline wasn't the worst. It is worth checking out.
3,This Isn't Working,"Boy, I really wish this were working as I really like Will Arnett. However, he is trying so hard that it is too much. Comedy should look more effortless than this. They all look like they are trying too hard to make this funny. Some of the supporting actors are dubious too. One guy keeps flaunting his chest hair, which is almost ape like. It is distracting and distasteful and pulls focus away from the comedy. Then there's the guy who is the alleged fiance. He is so obnoxious, so tree hugging, so unattractive that it is not possible for him to also be funny. And the love interest, Keri Russell, is downright unlikable as well. I wish they had just made it Will Arnett and the kid. They are the only good actors in this series and it would be so much better if it were rewritten around them, perhaps as guardian and ward."
4,Will Arnett Is Reason To Watch,"I love Will Arnett in the prior tv series where he's had a non lead role. These are at the very least: ""30 Rock"" where he tried to oust Alec Baldwin as head of NBC and ""Arrested Development"" where he was one of the craziest members of a very crazy family. I've even liked him in supporting roles in movies. The question is: can he lead a series. The odds are at best 50-50 after seeing this first episode. It sets up a slightly amusing comedy about him as an ultra wealthy guy who reunites with an activist woman he's always yearned for from afar. She now has a daughter who she has been hauling around the world in her work as an anthropologist. The daughter wants to relocate stateside which will give Will Arnett as Steven Wilde the chance to get the woman at long last. This is the premise and there are some funny moments but there need to be a lot more funny moments."
4,porcelain is worth it,"it costs more, but it's definitely worth getting porcelain. check for any rebates. also the magnetic-ness is extremely functional."
5,Sturdy Dry Erase Board,I use this dry erase board in my home office. It is quality made and very sturdy. It comes with all the mounting hardware and was easy to hang. It erases clean every time. I like that it's magnetic and has a tray for holding markers. A+.
4,Great Value,"Compare this board to other porcelain boards and you'll find this is less expensive then a lot of others. It's true that the install takes about 30 minutes but I doubt a $300 board is any different. Overall, I really pleased with this product and would recommend it."
3,"Nice board, terrible to hang","The board itself is great. Very high quality.However, it took a professional contractor 30 minutes to hang it on drywall. For the price, the mounting procedure should be better."
4,What I needed but some dents,It is exactly the right size I needed and it is easy to clean no matter how much you write. However the frame is not very strong and it came already with a couple of dents.
2,Good and Bad,"I bought these for a 1.25 Ghz G4 PowerMac, hoping to find an inexpensive speaker solution. The sound from these guys is pretty decent, especially for the price. However, 2 annoying issues persist that have me sending them back. 1) When you turn the speakers on, a very loud pop comes flying out. Sounds like a mini-explosion. 2) There is a continous low level ""hum"" that is perfectly annoying, especially if no music is playing. I've done lots of testing and it has nothing to do with my computer or soundcard as both issues exist if the computer is turned off or even if the X-120's are in a completely different room and not plugged into any audio device. It's too bad, because the sound is otherwise pretty good. I'm returning these and buying JBL Creature II's instead. My foray into cheap speakers is over, hopefully the more expensive, and sheilded, JBL's will be better........we shall see...."
3,You get what you pay for,They're okay in the world of super cheap speakers. The slight hum they have even when turned all the way down is quite annoying. Bass is surprisingly decent for not having a sub (granted a sub would be leaps and bounds better still).
4,Solid speakers,"Excellent sound for the price, good and solid build. However be advised if you connect your headphones through them it will sound a lot worse. So if you want to switch between these and headphones I recommend getting a Y-splitter to pipe sound to both and turn off the speakers when you don't need them."
1,Residual Humming is very very very annoying.,"When there is sound for these speakers to play, its fine and sounds quite nice. However, regardless of the volume setting, there is a residual hum which only stops when you turn off the power. It is very noticable and very very annoying.Unless you are in an environment where there is a lot of background noise, you will be driven you to return them. Even though these are approx $10 in price, it is still not worth it.Don't buy them, you will be wasting your money."
2,"An overly ambitious book which misses the mark,drastically.","More and more titles, promise and give less content wise. This book is no depature from that tradition. It is filled with short sighted claims and unbelievably ostentatious arguments bound by lotfy sentences. If a book were to be written by or about nomads, it would not be this."
1,Never ever got the book I ordered,"Never got the book, after taking my money they said my address was undeliverablenever contacted me or called, just canceled the order and did refund after several weeks of waiting, total waste of time and lost out on other dals, thanks Thomas Books and Amazon"
2,Preaching to the Choir,"This is hardly more than a too-little-too-late cheerleading exercise for poker. It just could have been so much more.I might be biased, though. As this movie lionizes a certain guy as a top poker player instead of the (IMHO) lucky stiff who tripped over $2.5 million while wandering in the dark in Las Vegas in 2003. But, as Vic tells Charlie in the movie The Ice Harvest, perhaps I'm being unkind.The DVD is not terrible. It's just a piece of fluff."
2,Bored me to tears,I am a avid poker player and was really looking forward to seeing this movie and getting up to speed on all the legalities and regulations of the online poker world...after 20 minutes I was so bored I turned it off. Don't bother.
2,Goes off into the ozone too quickly.,"Promised a ""hands on"" book, but quickly touches on several very technical variations. Not a good ""set it up"" book."
1,Thoroughly Disgusting,"I'm not a gore hound so this didn't appeal to me, at all. This movie does away with any suspense and simply shows it as gory as possible. If you are a true gore hound then I suspect this film is for you."
2,"Great Picture, NO Volume",Couldn't get the volume up high enough to hear more than 1 out of 5 words. I even used a hunter's listening device trying to get some use from this DVD. Looked very interesting in the inimitable Filth way.
1,this movie is utter rubbish,"this movie is the worst film of this genre i have ever seen, bbc horrors are cool, but this is a peice of white trailer park trash gore horror flick. the storyline is stupid, and the movie turns to worthless gore for cheap thrills. actually after watching this film i contemplated never watching another new horror movie in my life again.. what a complete WASTE OF TIME. dont bother.. instead go and seek out classic italian and american horror from the 60s and 70s.."
3,Could Have Added more money to this,I've been a fan of Cradle of Filth for some time now and since I've watched their videos I kept thinking what would a movie starring the awsome charecter of Dani Filth be like? Well I didn't have to wait for very long for this to come out. Once I watched I sadly had to say I was disappointed from the first half-hour. It felt very low budget and although dani's presence is amazing the rest of the cast really [are substandard]! But once the story of the guy with the missing leg starts things start getting better. More dialogue and better actors are presented and dani's presence because better every moment. With a few nice twist and one of the best endings I've ever seen this movie prooved it was worth the wait although they could of added more production money that could have made it an A class movie!
3,Diamond in the Rough,"Not being a huge COF fan, I purchased the movie for my daughter who insisted I watch it. I was surprised to find that this work has real potential. Definately not for those with a weak stomach. Still, if you look past the low budget, it does has a strong story line which is consistant trough out. Beyond the gore there was a vital thread of a morals to be told. Keep an eye on the sub plot, it's where the diamond is hidden. Perhaps if Dani Filth was given a full hollywood budget this work could have made it to it's full potential. Though my daughter would argue the campy early 70's style was intented."
1,Cradle of Junk!,"I'm a big fan of horror movies and there isn't much I haven't seen. But folks this movie is absolutely horrible. This movie has no point,no plot and just plain bad acting from start to finish. It is about 2 hours long I turned this garbage off in less than an hour. The cheap attempt at a gore fest is just awful to the point of not even being funny anymore. This movie is not scary,the gore is ridiculously stupid and these wannabe actors will make you sick with the terrible attempt at acting they do in this. I like COF and Dani Filth but he should stick to his day job. I have seen really bad B movies called horror but this out does them all. Don't waste money on this!"
2,"No where near worth the price. Should be, like, $5 on DVD!","OK, I don't hate Cradle of Filth, so I thought it would be cool to see Dani Filth in a horror movie. I knew it would be cheesy! That was no surprise. The story line had some potential, but the movie was executed so incredibly poor that the movie is just rubbish. Sorry lads, better luck next time. Dani wasn't even that bad, the movie was just terrible. Some of the actors were laughable in their performance! However, the girls are all really hot and have nice....FEATURES, I'll say! ^_^ Also, the DVD might actually be (somewhat) worth buying if it was priced at, say, $5?! Anyway, hopefully Dani will choose a better movie to be in, if he ever does one again. Apologies to all those who want this movie to be good (I know I did), but ""sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, well....it eats you!"""
2,Plot was good but some of the acting and all sound effects were disatifying.,Dani had a cool idea and made an interesting plot. But the low budget and ridiculously horrible sound effects ruined it for me.
3,Excellent information but as exciting as a textbook,"I enjoy hunting the book shelves at Amazon for a good Nature read. This time I picked the book with the intriguing title, the eastern cougar. The ongoing mystery about the eastern cougar's existence or extinction is one of the more fascinating problems in science at the present. The book has gathered together truly excellent info from from some hard to access areas. The information alone is worth the price of admission, but the way the information was set up made me wish the publishers had found a writer that could keep the facts straight and tell a story as well. I honestly desire to give this a higher grade, but reading is more than just facts, it's enjoying the craftsmanship of a writer that loves the subject, and weaves words in a way that you get lost in the story and in time. It is good as it stands, but it could have been much, much moreC Smith"
2,Misunderstood after all these years,"The exemplary part of this book is the reproduction of drawings, photographs and woodcuts which are fascinating and represent many genres of expression. The truly weak part of the text is the inaccurate portrayal of Aleister Crowley and his various followers. For a less distorted perspective on Mr. Crowley, his life, his theory, and his perspective, see Richard Kaczynski's ""Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley."" For a more detailed book on sex magick and tantra see Nikolas Shreck's ""Demons of the Flesh: sex magic"" that describes the philosophy and perspective of this path in depth."
2,A Long Disappointment,"This book just seems to go on forever. And, unfortunately it is not very good. The writing is poor and it appears that they forgot to proof read the book before publishing. I'd pass on this one."
1,"Love the series, but .......","I purchased both the teacher and student book at the same time. We love this series, the way the words are used and the stories in each lesson. As we are nearing the end of the books, we have come to discover that the copyright dates for these books do not match. The teacher book has a copyright date of 1999 and does not have the same amount of lessons and stories as the student edition, copyright 2010."
2,"A not-so-scary, mediocre film!","I was disappointed, after reading several reviews that implied this is a scary movie that has been overlooked by the general public. I'm a fan of made for tv 70's scary movies, and love movies that have things that go bump in the night, or hauntings, or scary old houses. This movie was basically more psychological, and not scary at all. The so-called surprise ending was not developed enough to make sense. The directing was poor, and all in all, I'm so frustrated that I spent money on this film. It's priced at only 4.99 now, so that may be worth it, if the shipping is free. It's cheaper than renting it, but you'll probobly never want to watch it again, so why own it?"
5,another music teacher,I agree with the reviewer that said that these DVD are great for elementary music classes. I have often used them when I need substitute lesson plans. I use them with grade 6. The story lines are fictional but based on the composer's life and times. The stories are thought provoking. It keeps the students attention.
3,Into The Bloodstream...,"It's actually unfortunate that ANTIBODY is rated R. Aside from some violence and a bit of language, it could have easily been PG-13 or even PG. Yes, it's a CGI-heavy update of FANTASTIC VOYAGE (sort of). Yes, it has lots of goofy situations and cornball dialogue. Still, the kid in me enjoyed it and smiled at the internal micro-universe idea. Lance Henriksen (ALIENS, PUMPKINHEAD, NEAR DARK) and the beautiful / talented Robin Givens are a comfortable match, making the most of their relatively silly roles. So, if you can shift your brain into F-U-N mode and relax, you'll have a good time w/ this one..."
2,SEND IN THE WHITEYS!,"ANTIBODY is definitely a mediocre ripoff of FANTASTIC VOYAGE, and what merits it has rests purely on some minor individual achievements. First, William Zabka, long known villain of all his movies, dons a German accent, and plays a good guy who actually saves the day! Lance Henricksen also plays a good guy, but one who seems desperately in need of Geritol. And poor Robin Givens looks like a snow cone with that hairdo, and looks like she was in need of Ex-Lax.The effects are pretty dismal, and although it maintained my interest, it's certainly not a film I would recommend you buy, but might rent when you're in the mood for a trip through the body!"
2,not a fantastic voyage rip-off,"i disagree it's a rip off of ""fantastic voyage"". yes, the theme is similar, being shrunk down and injected into a body and the political overtones of the movie, but it's a different movie made decades later. i agree with the reviewer that stated it should be ""pg"" rather than ""r"" rated. nothing really warrents that rating. it's more espionage than sci-fi and the cover misleads you in that. overall, it's okay, and it is full screen. i'm a fan of lance henriksen, so enjoyed it from that vantage. i'd recommend renting versus owning it though. or buy it really cheap, like i did at a flea market."
4,A good summary of the BCO,A great companion for the Book of Common Order to the Reformed Church in America. A must have for ministers and lay leaders.
2,Good taste... expires too soon!,"First off let me say that the product (Reese Homestyle Garlic and Cheese Croutons) were great. They were light, crunchy and very tasty.The major negative was that we received this product in Mid October 2011 and the freshness date is Mid January 2012! So we end up with 12 bags of croutons that we have to try to finish in 3 months. I realize that they will most likely not ""expire"" then, however the taste may have become stale. The company should really watch to make sure that the freshness date isn't soon for so large of a package."
3,The best avaliable...BUT,"does not capture the majesty and spirituality of the Chant Du Monde french label release of the USSR conducted by Alexander Svechnikov 1965, long out of print..Read my comments on the Polyansky release about the other various russian choirs."
4,Very good - especially great are the liturgical additions,"Having the liturgical introductions really helps accentuate the mood of what surely is Eastern Orthodoxy's greatest musical masterpiece!Otherwise, the performance is very good but not quite to my taste (admittedly molded on the Shaw recording {which I find has its full share of fast and lively sections, contrary to what some think...} - which one I'll still recommend as the optimal!), notably on account of its not precisely sticking to Old-Church Slavonic as a language (see my revised comments for Shaw for more discussion thereof). Nevertheless, there's much to learn from it and is to be warmly recommended"
1,"For all of it's promises, this book yielded minimal results","We purchased this book with high hopes for our stubborn two and 1/2 year old daughter. After a long, anxious weekend (not the ""less than a day"" promised in the title) of using Azrin's method to a ""T"", we are not much closer to potty training than when we began. The method made our daughter nervous and weepy and left us feeling awful. Don't be too quick to buy the promises... there's got to be a better way."
3,Not Very Realistic,"I read this book before potty training my 2 1/2 year old boy, and decided Azrin's approach just wouldn't work with my son. Forcing a toddler to stay focused on the potty for an entire day is much easier said than done. And when a toddler doesn't want to drink liquids, he's not going to drink liquids. My son is inquisitive and pretty strong-willed, so I knew this boot camp approach would be frustrating for both of us.I also read Lois Kleint's book Potty Train in Three Days, and decided to use that training method instead. My son was potty trained by the second day, and he's been accident free for four months now. Kleint's approach is much more realistic than Azrin's, given a toddler's short attention span and tendency toward stubbornness. If you're about to potty train your child, do yourself a favor and check out Potty Train in Three Days. I can't recommend that book enough!"
2,Too de-humanizing,"I am the mother of a 2 year old daughter who seemed interested in toilet training. This book scared the pants off of me, and kept us on our path of interest and discovery. While the methods described are well researched and planned, they seem only appropriate for extreme cases and difficult children. The repeated practicing is belittling and demoralizing for children and unnecessary if your child is truely ready and given no indication of learning difficulties. Bribery and candy play as much a role in this method as the parents, encouragement and the child's self-esteem. Children aren't expected to learn to walk, talk, eat with siverware or anything else in one day, why toilet training?"
2,Outdated,"I couldn't believe some of the stuff they wrote in the beginning of this book about how children in diapers were a ""source of drudgery"" and ""embarrassment"" to parents. PLEASE! It takes less than a minute to change a diaper.They also advocate telling the child they are ""bad"" when they have an accident. I was looking forward to trying this method, but I absolutely will not use this method. ""Bad""? Give me a break!(By the way - the book was written in 1974). I wish I had known that before I wasted my money."
1,horrible,"I swear this set us back a year in potty training. at the time it didn't seem too much but now.... don't bother, they will let you know when they are ready. and it takes more than a day. I mean really, how many things can a kid learn in ONE DAY and do it again!"
1,just awful,"I picked this up out of curiosity. It is dreadful. The ""plan"" here is to fill your poor toddler full of liquids (offering salty snacks if he/she isn't guzzling enough) so he/she will have to ""go"" frequently. Then you make the poor kid spend a whole day, or longer, just focusing on using the toilet, and cleaning up his/her own ""accidents"". I have a four year old and a two and a half year old who are both exclusively using the toilet (even through naps and night) and I never used a method like this one! Gentle encouragement, and they'll do it when they're ready. The advice in this book borders on child abuse!"
2,outdated book,The information is helpful- but certainly dated. I also have a hard time believing that any child can be trained in a few hours.
1,YUCK,"This is awful. It may work better for older children but for my 22 month old, it was an unmitigated disaster. It is NOT loving and traumatic (at least it was for me). I would never recommend this book."
3,review,I got this for my grandchildren. Didn't really have to use it. When the parents saw it they put their efforts in high gear and did their job.
3,Other choices better,"I wasn't that impressed with this book as others. Some good, useful info, but other books I have read seem to be more up to date. The language in the book is way out dated. I feel some of the info is relevant, but a lot of it seems so old fashion and out dated. I liked other books I have reviewed better."
1,The author should be jailed,"POSSIBLY THE WORST BOOK ON CHILD CARE EVER WRITTEN - I AGREE 100% WITH THE READER IN SEATTLE REGARDING THE TRAINING TECHNIQUES. CHILDREN ARE CHILDREN NOT PAVLOV'S DOGS - THEY RESPOND TO KINDNESS AND NURTURING, NOT THREATS AND HUMILIATION. IF YOU VALUE YOUR CHILD'S SANITY, SELF-RESPECT AND TRUST - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. WHAT A PITY THEY DON'T HAVE NEGATIVE STAR RATINGS."
4,Potty training twins,Just finished the book and have ordered a doll that drinks and wets. Can't wait to try it out. Book has alot of good tips and sounds like it may really work.
1,Did Not Work!!!,"My 2 and a half year old son is very bright and seemed ready to potty train, so I thought we would give this book a try. I felt it was very demeaning to him, all the practice runs to the potty just wore him out and frustrated him. And I felt horrible for putting him through it. At the end of the day he certainly was not trained, and we are still working on it weeks later, but at a more casual pace. We are both happier!! Don't believe the title!!!"
1,don't buy it!,"Potty training is a skill, such as crawling, walking and sitting up...see it as such and do not use this insane method to train your child unless they are completely ready!I bought this book on a recommendation of a friend. I tried it several times and felt like I was a failure and my child (who was well over 2 yrs.) was incapable of being potty trained. What a joke!! I waited another 6 months, and he did it by himself! BY HIMSELF! A week or so after that he no longer needed pull ups at night! Since then he has had a total of 5 accidents (daytime AND nighttime accidents combined) in over a year. FORGET THIS BOOK and wait a little longer...avoid all the strain, stress and pressure on both you and your child."
2,Great theory,"I agree with the review that stated that this book was ahead of it's time in the 70's but I have never been ashamed of my child nor have we (my husband and I) decided that one of us is the only one to help our son learn this important milestone. I wish that I had bought the book Potty Time for One, Two or Three first- the no pressure approach has worked very well, without tears on either side of the potty chair."
1,A Waste of Money,"I bought the book with hopes of finding a technique that would finally get my 3.5 year old interested in potty training. I wish I knew it was written in the 70's before I bought it. After reading it, I decided there was no way I would use it to train my child. I am a stay at home Mom who has time to encourage toilet training and do not need to rush my child. I also feel that there is no reason to scold a child for wetting his/her pants while they are learning to use the toilet....that doesn't seem to be a great self-esteem builder. Learning to use the toilet should be a positive experience and accidents should be looked upon as such....accidents. I also was disappointed that nowhere in the training did the author stress the importance of washing the childs' hands after using the potty. That is just as important for a child to practice and perform as the act of going itself. I do not recommend this book to any one."
1,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, IT IS DATED!","This book is laughable....it is circit 1970's. The writing is awlful, not up to date at all. He is saying give your kid a ""soda"" when he goes, are you kidding me?!"
1,the worst advice you will ever get,"...My sister in law and I both tried this method. I was motivated and organized and very ready with a second child on the way. At the end of the second day I ended up with a very frustrated, unhappy, confused toddler who was strung out from all of the treats that they recommend giving them! This was my sister in law's experience as well. My son is a really easy kid, and when we did get him trained it was in a matter of a few days, and with no problems- and we used none of their methods. Other mothers I have talked to have had the same results as I have. If you want good advice, do not read this book- try what to expect the toddler years, or ""Making the terrible twos terrific "" by John Rosemond. We have just used his method with our 2 year old- who was trained by 22 months and pretty easily..."
3,fine,"I have never actually completed this book. My son loved the dvd: potty power, so that seemed to work great. I had already potty trained another little boy (as their nanny) so I knew most of the basics that this book discusses.The book itself is a nice size though"
1,Not a great method for my 35 month old,"I am giving this method only one star.My child basically cried all day during this and it was stressful for both of us. Having her run around in her wet pants to ""practice"" (the first time she had an accident)...only made her more comfortable, just like in diapers, of having wet, soiled pants. She peed in the potty twice from sitting on the potty 20 minutes each time. She has made no effort to pee in the potty since on her own...she pees on herself and then tells us after. :( Just had wet pants number 6.Patience Patience Patience and a different method is what I recommend."
5,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A GREAT HELP,"LOGICAL STEPS, WELL WRITTEN, WELL RESEARCHED, I AGREE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL BELOW, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ""KNOWING WHEN.."" BUT NOT A LOT OF PRACTICAL ADVICE, SO A BOOK LIKE THIS IS INCREDIBLY APPRECIATED. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED."
2,Didn't work for 3 year old boy,"I heard from several women that this worked for their girls so I tried it. It was a disaster for my son. He was too stressed by the focused attention, too focused on the treats and actually enjoyed the practice sessions that he was not suppose to enjoy. The four hours (the amount of time it was suppose to take him to learn) went like this: two hours of not peeing at all, one hour having two accidents and one hour of peeing (3 drops) every 30 seconds on the potty. After his nap, he never went again in the potty. He also would not poop for two days when he normally goes at least three times a day. The next day I put him back in diapers and he finally pooped in the evening and it obviously hurt him. The book makes it all too simple and doesn't address possible problems like stool witholding which happens to kids often. I read the book twice and know I did it right but it was not for us. We're on to the slower approach now. Good luck."
3,definately not as fool proof as it sounds,"I was very confident that this would work on our 29 month old daughter. I did everything the way the book said to except I only did about 5 practices after accidents because I would have had to carry my daughter to get her to do anymore than that (especially after the 3rd, 4th and 5th accidents). It has been 2 days and she still isn't to the point of self initiated toileting. We have not gone back to diapers at all so I think it did help as far as getting a good start. We are still just reminding her to sit on the toilet every couple of hours and right before and after sleeping and have had only a couple of accidents. Just don't assume it will work instantly and be ready for a very long day. It is also a little confusing to read so make sure you read over it a few times before you try it. It's definately an old method and it would be wonderful if someone would do an updated version of it. good luck!"
5,It totally works!!!!,It took my 3 year old son 1/2 day and he was completely trained; no accidents! I have recommended this book to all my friends. It really works.
2,"Practical approach, but didn't work for my 2.5 yr old boy","Following the book methods, I potty trained my son over the w-end. It took a little longer than the book advertised. He was having about 90% success for several days. After about a week, he unexplainable refused to go potty anymore... so he's been back in diapers for several months now."
5,Coming back for the grandchildren!,I love this book. I used it when my son was born in 1975 and did it again with my daughter a couple of years later. I loaned out the book so many times that it finally got lost.Now I have a little grandson who will need it within a few months. Glad I can find it again.
2,Didn't Work For My Child,"The techniques in this book didn't work for my child. It may be do to my error. We did successfully potty train by trail and error. When he figured out that he didn't like the wet feeling of ""going"" in big boy underwear, he started making it to the potty in time."
3,DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP,"YES, IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF EVERYONE COULD DO THIS. THE PREMISE IS WONDERFUL, HOW MANY OF US THAT ARE DREADING TOILET TRAINING WOULD LOVE TO DO IT IN LESS THAN ONE DAY? BUT REALISTICALLY, NOT EVERY CHILD CAN DO THIS. MY DAUGHTER TRAINED FAST, THE BOOK WAS HEPFUL, BUT DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP. HOW MANY PARENTS OF A TWO YEAR OLD CAN SIT IN ONE ROO, ALL DAY WITH NO DISTRACTIONS, NO TV, NO BARNEY, NO PLAYHOUSE DISNEY, ALL DAY? MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE HAD A FIT!"
2,"a confidence-builder, nothing more","meaning confidence in your own judgement. i purchased this book thinking it held some unknown secret to how to potty train a child in a short amount of time. the pearls of wisdom i gleaned from this book were 1) make them drink a lot, so there are more 'learning opportunities', 2) make the teaching area a place with a fairly waterproof floor such as a kitchen and 3) express your displeasure at accidents.this book is a fairly quick read and in the end it realized it says nothing new - it's a bestseller because it takes advantage of every harried parent's fear of the unknowns of potty training."
2,Horrible experience with this book.,Great idea but really rigid and didn't work. I felt horrible and my daughter was miserable after trying this technique. We quit for a few months after this experience and then I used a sticker reward system which made us both feel good about the experience and she was trained in 3 days. I like learning to be fun and did not feel this was right for us.
5,"Yes, it does work!!!","I used the techniques advised in this book with all 4 of my children, including my 4th with developmental disabilities. My oldest son, at 23 months, was 90% trained in 3 hours, night time dry within a week. My second and third, both girls, were trained within 6-8 hrs, although 1 needed night diapers for several months. With my 4th child, with developmental delays, I waited until be was 30 months old and all went beautifully - took a few days until about 90% dry, totally trained within a week.I would stress that it works best if you start fresh - haven't already tried other methods and failed. Also - would really stress that you must follow the book as closely as possible. Plan NOTHING else for that day - do not even pick up the cell phone. It is exhausting, but you will find it well worth the concentrated effort. And they did not expect the treat rewards after the first couple days - just forgot about them. DO IT!!"
5,This book teaches more than potty training! Wonderful.,"I have trained two children so far with great success using this book. My son, who is now 11, trained in less than a day as predicted and had fewer than a handful of accidents afterwards. My daughter trained last year with similar results. I have two smaller children and plan to use it as well. What makes the method work so well is that it helps the parent understand the child's perspective, how to communicate better. I found that my children were more than potty trained afterwards. They matured considerably and became more responsible little toddlers.I advise those considering using the book to read it through first and follow it consistently. The day of training is pretty intense and it does take some effort to plan for it. It also takes commitment to stick with the practicing afterwards which will give you and the child a work-out, but it is worth it...and so much easier and more rewarding in the long run."
2,"HM, well OK","Hm, I was definitely disappointed. This book is not well written. You have to make maticulous notes if you are going to catch the important stuff at all. Also it doesn't take into account the difference in babies personalities. It just lumps the difficult ones as ""stubborn"" and tells you to work on the stubborness first if that is the case with yours. Which is a very narrow view. My Hannah isn't stubborn, but her personality makes it so that she is tooooo interested in the rest of the world to worry about pooping in a potty even if we spend all day working on it. She enjoyed sitting on the potty from time to time, but had to get up every two seconds.... anyway they would probably just say she isn't ready yet, and maybe that is true. But hey they said that someone who wants to can potty train a 21 month old or was it less than that, can if they only follow these principles. Well good luck!!!"
1,Worst day of my child's life,"Think long and hard about why you want this book. For teaching the mechanics to a younger (20 month or so) child, it might work. For my 3 1/2 yr old, it was a dismal failure. The mechanics were not the problem - he just didn't want to go. Still doesn't. This probably made it worse. We hadn't pressured him before but we tried to do the 10 ""positive practices"" after each accident. It was NOT positive. It was horrible and took 2 HRS to do the 10 practices because he was dragging his feet. I wish I'd never heard of this book. I don't think he had negative associations with the potty before but he sure does now."
2,Not in a day or less,"This book has a lot of good ideas, however, it did not help with training my 3 year old. It requires you to load up your child on liquid so he/she has the urge to go, which is a good idea. However, checking to see if he/she has dry pants every 5 minutes isn't feasible. Your conversation with your child the whole time is supposed to be about going on the potty - however many hours it takes to get them trained. My son got bored with the conversation and didn't pay attention. And once the child gets the whole going on the potty thing, they aren't supposed to tell you when they have to go, they are just supposed to go. The book states that you should put the potty where ever they may be - outside, inside, in their room - so it is easily accessible to them. I would rather have my son come and get me when he has to go.Needless to say, my son is still not potty trained and it's been 3 weeks since we've received this book."
2,Not for everyone,"I was very excited to try this method as my sister-in-law had used it successfully with her three girls. At almost two and a half, my son was showing every sign of being ready to train. I bought the book and poured lots of time and effort arranging the training day. The training went great. According to the book, he was successfully trained by 1 p.m. after starting at 8 a.m. He had used the potty seven times... six without having to be reminded. We added toys, went to different rooms, resumed normal life. All was great until he went down for his nap at 2 p.m. and woke up and had four accidents. It is the next day, and he still hasn't used the potty. Please don't put a whole lot of time and effort into this method. It was very disappointing and stressful for me and my toddler."
2,Not for a sensitive child,"Having heard that this technique is good, I tried it with my daughter at the recommended age. Although I was LESS stern than the book recommends, the process upset her enough to have created phobias that she didn't have before. When she has an accident now--or even if she spills a drink on her clothes or gets her shoes wet at the playground--she freaks out. She also took to withholding her poop for days at a time, I think (based on other clues, too) because she was worried about having an accident. She just wanted to avoid pooping altogether. The withholding started to create medical problems for her. We're back on track now pooping in diapers, but I would recommend to anyone with a sensitive child to use a very gentle potty training method. The method in this book, while excellent for many children, is not for everyone. For our child, many months after we used this technique (and then dropped it for a gentler approach), we are still reaping the negative consequences of it."
4,"Good to start with, but be open to change...","When I started training my 34 month daughter it started out well for the first 45 minutes. She went on the potty. Then she became terrified of the potty and would scream when I put her on it. So I relaxed a little because she was getting upset that she couldn't play with her toys and had to stay in the kitchen all the time. I let her play with her toys but kept her drinking and every 15 minutes asked if she needed to potty. Then she started going on the potty when I relaxed this method some. It's day 3 now and she is doing pretty well, occasional accident but I am pleased. You can get a doll that pees at Target...and at Walmart. I would recommend starting out with this method but being open to changing it a little to fit your child, if you see something else working better. This book gave me a lot of ideas to work with though that I wouldn't have thought of."
4,Very useful,I thought this book was very useful in toilet training my 2-yr-old son. It is very easy to read and follow. I found the program to be slightly impractical (there was NO WAY I could keep him from playing while we spent time working on toileting) and so I modified it a bit by working intensely for an hour or so and then relaxing things a bit more than they suggest and earlier than they suggest. My son had four accidents the first day but only a handful in the following week and a half. I LOVE that part of this program is self-sufficiency. I don't have to pull pants up or down or empty the toilet pot. He does all of this by himself. I have a Master's degree in psychology and this book uses standard practices from learning theories. I was hopeful that it would work and have not been disappointed.
5,Toilet Training in Less Than a Day,"Price was unbeatable, even including shipping, and the product was delivered quickly. I was very happy with this company. I have successfully used this method with all five of my children, (all trained in less than one day,) and so have two of my sisters-in-law after my recommedation, so I wanted a copy to share with a fried who was struggling with this issue. Awesome book! Great company to purchase from!"
3,Didn't get much use.,"I made the mistake of buying this book while my son was already in the process of training so it didn't get much use. I thumbed through it and can see the concept though. I am assuming that my little girl when the time comes will benefit from it's use. Especially since girls are so nurturing. It makes sense to have her teach a dollie how to go potty which will help her, too.I would have liked to know that I needed to buy a potty training doll before I bought the book since that is the whole idea of the book."
3,Good book,"I loved the book, even though there were a LOT of out-dated things in it (aprons, etc. ha ha). Our son didn't like the traditional potty so we ordered a urinal and he DID train in one day. We couldn't use this method because we couldn't order the doll that goes with it because it was out of stock. So, we took the basic principles and trained our son that way. I was really looking forward to using this method, but the doll was unavailable."
5,Accomplishes just what the title says,"A friend recommended this book. Wish I'd known about it when my daughter was closer to 24 months--I'm confident she could have been trained well before 30 months, which was when I got the book. Heartily endorse."
3,misinformed,"The book was in good shape except that it had highlighting in it. The seller had advertised that there was no highlighting or marking in the book, so I was dissapointed to see that there was quite a bit of highlighting."
1,The worst book ever,This book has taken being a mean parent to a new level. It says to force a child to pee and poop! Yeah as it is possible to drag a child to the toliet. I think this books should be banned and never allowed to be read again. The quack who wrote this book says to make your child eat and drink so they pee and poop no realistic at all. If you follow this book like I tried you will be potty training for 2 years since I got off to such a bad start.
1,NEVER RECEIVED BOOK BUT THEY TOOK MY MONEY!!!,"I purchased this book, it's been over a month and a half and no book. I sent an e-mail complaining that I had not received the book and got no response. Very, very disappointed and upset. No book and no refund...what a deal!"
2,"Very dated material, but solid ideas","Very dated material. This was written in the 1960s and it shows. The info is still relevant and reliable, but you definitely have to look past the feminist iconography. This book was recommended to me by many mothers, so I know it works and the ideas are worthwhile. Just don't be expecting anything easy-to-read, amusing or politically correct. It's material reads like a psychology text book; very matter-of-fact and not very user-friendly. If you can get past all that, it's good."
3,Potty Training my 35 month old,"Hi,I decided to buy this book b/c we have another child on the way and it is in our best interest to have our soon to be 3- year- old potty trained. The book was helpful. It is a little lengthy but I am all about books when it comes to my child. The book is a little intense and I didn't follow everything it said to do. I am a stay at home mom and have plenty of time to train him without being as intense as the book. We certainly were not potty trained in a day because of this and that didn't bother me. This is a good book to have and it is a great freedom to be out of diapers."
1,Horrible,"I was shocked, when I received this book, that anyone had recommended it. It is horrifying. I couldn't imagine telling my child that her Grandparents will be upset with her for peeing her pants or that ""only babies pee their pants"". How demeaning. I realize this book is quite old, but I don't remember being spoken to that way as a child. I can't believe that parents actually read this and still tried it on their poor children. I have decided to just throw it away, and look for a book that will make toilet training a more positive experience for my daughter. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK, NO CHILD DESERVES TO BE TREATED THIS WAY!"
1,very poor book : (,"I have a 3 year old son who is learning to potty train. I started reading the book toilet training in less then a day and am very disappointed. The author comres training a toddler to go on the potty to teaching ""profoundly retarted adult"". I feel this book is very outdated not only on potty training but also techniques in training."
1,What a bunch of baloney!,This book is horrible. People should not teach their children to be ashamed of their bodies and its natural functions. Telling your child they are dirty and bad or clean and therefore good...talk about developing a Freudian complex! These methods are completely out-dated. I am shocked that it is still in print.
2,The book was easy to read but the method didn't work for us,"I found this book easy to read, and even had fun preparing for our ""potty party."" My son met the criteria and I followed the rules to the letter, but we had absolutely zero success. Months later, my otherwise advanced son is still in diapers.Although the book is easy to read, it is terribly outdated. Giving toddlers candy and soda as treats is no longer acceptable (we don't even do juice unless it's diluted!) and the social structures described barely exist anymore. (Homemaker mothers with nothing better to do, detached fathers, close-knit neighbors and the like.) Further, the idea that children are not to be spanked or yelled at is presented as novel, and the main reward for proper toileting is lots of physcial attention. At least in my household, this is already the norm (as it was in my parents' home). Finally, it addresses pooping as an afterthought, and that didn't work well for us. A lovely method in theory, though."
4,Worth the effort,This book was a great start to potty training. My 32 month old son was urinating on the potty all by himself within 3 hours. It took much longer for him to learn to have is BM's on the potty. But overall the book contributed greatly to his success!
5,Great book!,This book is great! I was skeptical about it and didn't think it would happen so quickly. I had a goal of one week instead of one day but my son was literally potty trained in less than two days!
1,Didn't work for us,Toilet Training in Less Than A DayWe had high hopes for the book. My daughter and I both read it in one Friday afternoon in the hopes of potty training my three year old grandson the next day. She worked with him all day on Saturday and I tried on Sunday. I don't know if our little diaper-wearer is just that stubborn or if the book is just all wet.
2,Snookered by Rhetoric and High Hopes,"This book yielded nothing but tears for three days with my sweet 2yo son. The book was so convincing that I was sure it would work given enough time. Basically, you pump them up with fluids, reward with candy for dry pants, and shame with ""fun"" practice excercises for accidents.After three days of sugar-coated torture (for both us us) he went on to wear diapers for another year. Since then, two other children have learned to use the toilet with much less involvement from me (another son at 2.5yrs. and a daughter at 2yrs.)The only good idea I got from this book was to focus on dryness, not accidents. And, it was pretty cheap, so I didn't loose much money (just my son's self respect), hence the second star."
5,Worked 30 years ago-,I used this method for my son and now bought a copy for him to try on his son.After the first day he was 90% trained! He really got the concept and just had toget used to it. He was almost 3 and ready which made it easier.
5,It Works!,"This book first came out in 1974. I used the method for three children, 2 girls and a boy. It worked! Then 15 years later I had another girl and could not find or remember the name of the book, but still remembered the method. It still works! Try it! I plan on purchasing more copies for my grandchildren!"
5,This Really Works even if your child is nearing the age of 3,"To start, this is a wonderful book for parents ready, willing, and able to have their child potty trained and for the child who thinks he or she is not ready, willing, and able. I also waited for my son to give me a ""sign"" that he was ready to be potty trained. But finally I said enough is enough and started reading this book. I asked my son if he wanted to wear underpants the day after I finished reading this book and he said ""YES"". I started implementing the rules and sure enough he had the idea in less than a idea. In a week's time he had not had an accident (no urine, bowel movements was another story). Be the second week he would run to the potty when he needed to have a bowel movement and by week three no accidents at all. I believe that he was to old for the doll thing, however, I will keep the doll handy when number 2 comes along for potty training."
2,Limited success,"My toddler really disliked this method and went mulish. On the second day he was purposely wetting his pants and holding in when sitting on the potty. This method probably works for some children, but not all. If your child likes to follow directions and is delighted by praise, this method will probably work better for you. On the plus side, he has learned to put on and take off his underpants, and to put wet pants in the hamper."
4,A Huge Help,"I found this book to be a huge help to me while potty training my children. It gives step-by-step instructions and does NOT use punishment or humiliation in any way. If you consider having your child clean up after themselves humiliation, then this book is not for you!!! Both my sons did well with this program and I will be using it with my daughter very soon (she's not quite two yet).As another reviewer stated - this is an EXHAUSTING day for the parent and child. It's sort of like a bandaid - pull it off quick and it hurts a lot for a second or do it slow and it's painful for a while. I prefer the quick method rather than drawing out potty training for weeks or months! Be ready for a day of boredom and frustration but it is so worth it. Both my kids had a huge sense of accomplishment and no negative feelings at all.This method is not for everyone but it certainly worked for me. I did not give the book 5/5 because it is a bit outdated (written in the 70s). Good luck to all of you!"
5,Success in less than 4 hours,"The reason for my review is because I am recommending this book to a friend today.I heard about this book on the Phil Donaghue show back in the 70's and used this method for toilet training my 2 1/2 yr old son. Using their method and following the steps, by noon my son was accident free.I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you follow the steps as outlined, and your child is 'ready', you cannot fail."
3,"Sounds logical, but it didn't work for us","This book is a quick read and sounds really logical. It didn't work for our family, however. My daughter was already able to control her bowels/bladder, but she must not have been ready to put her waste in the toilet. She did love getting lots of yummy drinks and tasty treats. Seven months after we tried this method, she decided that she wanted candy, so she just started using the potty. Her only 'accidents' were difficulties getting her pants/undies down quickly enough (2x) and sometimes she gets the bed wet at night, though more often she uses her little potty in her room at night and then puts on a pull-up instead of underwear (her choice). She decided to be a 'big girl' when she was 37.5 months old.I think she just wanted to be in control of her own body. BTW, she became a big sister when she was 36 months old."
2,Didn't Work in a Day,"While it had some ideas, I think kids will do it if they are ready, and won't if they aren't. I tried all the steps with 2 different children and neither really took to them."
2,Had me and my daugher both in tears,"I tried this method with my daughter when she was 25 months old. One hour into it, both of us were in tears. Frustrated and disappointed, I bought three other toilet training books and read each front to back. It certainly helped me to get other perspectives on the issue versus the ""hard core"" approach taken in this book. In our second attempt, I took bits and pieces from each book and, pretty much ""winging it"", had my daughter trained in less than one day. Being a busy girl, it was EXTREMELY difficult for her to focus on just the activity of toilet training for the time period called for in this book. I certainly used some of the ideas presented but, in hindsight, it was too harsh a method to have worked for my child. You CAN train your child in a day or less without using this method. My second daughter is now ready for toilet training and we will not be using this method."
1,May be too much pressure,"I tried this book's method with my son and he seemed to regress from the point he was before I read the book. I was very upbeat and positive about the whole thing, however it seemed to be too much pressure for him. I did not use this method with my daughter and she learned to use the potty within a week compared to a year for my son. Maybe it works for some children. Just be sure to take cues from your child. If he or she seems to be tired of the process at any time please stop and try later! Every child will eventually use the potty. BE PATIENT!"
5,Daughter Works for Chocolate,"This method worked for us perfectly - Done potty training in 2 hours! (she was about 2 and 10 mo.) My daughter would do anything to get her chocolate treats. Really what works is finding a reward that your child really likes. If they get candy or sweets a lot, then rewarding them with chocolate won't seem like a great incentive. Also, if they are one of those kids who won't care if they pee all over themselves in big kid underwear, they will be a harder subject to train."
3,Skeptical,"Of course, I was skeptical, but had heard good things about the book. I got all the stuff I needed to get. The first day was tough, but we had some success. Day 2 and the morning of day 3 there were accidents and successes. By the morning of day 3, though, I felt like a failure and thought I should start the therapy bank account for my 30 mo. old daughter. I decided that when Nathin Azrin wrote this book, pullups weren't invented. We disparingly went to pullups. However, to my surprise, occasionally, my daughter still initiated pottying on her own. However, after one week, we are no where near wearing panties 100% of the time. I can't decide why it didn't work for us. But we did get the idea going, which is why I rated it three stars. Good luck to anyone starting! Have a mimosa for breakfast!"
4,It works!,"This book is great(my wife did all the work)My 2 1/2 year old boy love teaching the doll how to go potty. The sticker book we bought along with has helped too! We tried everything and he just did'nt get it now he's going to the potty by himself!I'm not saying we don't have any wet pants ,but they are few and far between!!!! The only reason I gave the book 4 stars was I though it could stand to be bigger and it would be great if the pages would fold over. Any how it does work!"
5,Highly Recommended for Motivated Parents,This method worked GREAT for my 23 month old daughter. She was totally tt in 3 days (bm too/and nighttime/naps). I really liked this method because she is able to do everything by herself! There is a lot of preparation needed with this method - supplies/rereading/list making AND preparing your child by making sure they will follow directions you give them. The book gives all these details. I highly recommend this method - even with all the preparation and the intensity during the training - it is worth all of it to have a totally trained kid in such a short time. The book also stresses making the whole process fun (which is amazingly possible minus a little bit of the time during training). Good luck
5,"Amazingly, it DOES work!","This book was recomended to me by my two sisters, who trained 3 children each with success - in one day! I tried it on my two sons (one was 2-1/2 the other 3 yrs. old at the time) and it worked in less than a half a day - including night wetting. In addition to toilet training, I have learnt some great methods for teaching them other things. The ""manual guidance"" works great also for teaching shoe-tying and dressing alone. I've recommended this book to all my friends. Most are scared to try it! Do try - belive me, it's worth it! - no smelly puddles, no wet pants, no being angry at your child, no changing wet sheets in the middle of the night - pure luxury, at the ""cost"" of one day's intensive work!"
1,Unrealistic,"First time moms...this is a poor book to use for your child's potty training. I did not see the method as either practical nor was it realistic. I guess I should have known when I saw that it was written by PHD's instead of parents that have trained their own children in the real world. The expectation here is that you can get a 20 month old (on up)to maintain an attention span on potty training for several consecutive hours!!! Terribly unrealistic! Not to mention, I felt the mess was just not worth it. My daughter and I gave up on it in search of a method less militaristic and more flexible. This approach was much too stressful on both parties."
1,"If you get any resistance, I say quit right away","I tried this method several years ago -- now I am back here reviewing its contents simply because I am taking a class on ""shame"" and am going to write up an analysis of this technique and how it employs shaming tactics to work. If the child is basically ready, that is not a big deal, but if the child is not ready, I think it can be quite traumatic and really cause problems down the road -- especially if that is the method that parents use to obtain compliance from their kids on other matters. In my case, my daughter really didn't get it the first day, and on the second day I had a strong feeling that to continue would really undermine the trust and love completely. So I stopped and dropped entire matter completely. After about six months I started in again gradually. She was completely potty trained by age 3, without the trauma, so I think that was the right call."
3,"Works for some, not for all","You know that old saying about kids not coming with instruction manuals? Well, this is no different. It's a great system for some kids, but it doesn't work on all of them. Don't think you've found the Holy Grail of toilet training just by buying this book. It worked on my daughter. Not so much on my son. If you're having a hard time, it's certainly worth looking into though."
3,"This is a well written book, easy to read and follow","This book is well written and easy to understand. It gives a new approach to an old problem just make sure you read where the method came from, if you think you are going to actually potty train a TODDLER in a day wake up and smell the coffee, this method was originally intended for un-toilet trained mentally retarded adults. Please don't think I am saying this doesn't work, it does just dont expect it in a day. ( Unless you are trying to train an adult"
1,don't buy this book,This book doesn't even deserve one star -- don't buy it. I threw it in the trash because the training theory is outdated and rigid.
1,These are children. Not animals!,"If I could give this book zero stars, I would! I did not listen to my intuition, and we tried this method. I just hope we have not permanently scarred our son! The process that it tells you to do when they have an accident is unbelievable and cruel. We are on day 3 of potty training, and we have had some success, but only after we threw away this book and started treating him like a 3 year old boy instead of an animal. If it means that we have to wait a while to say he is potty trained, that's fine. I would recommend ""Potty Training for Dummies"" instead. I was a dummy for trying this methed, but never again!"
3,So So,"I followed the instructions to a T, but alas was unsuccessful. My child did go pee and poo in the potty with in the first 4 hours, but was very tramatized by the accidents she had in her underware. After nap she refused to get out of bed b/c she didn't want to put big kid underware back on. She cried like I have never seen before when I tried to put them back on her. She wasn't throwing a tantrum, she was honestly scared.I did still rate this book with 3 stars b/c I feel like it was a good method if my child would have been ready. Even though she passed all the test to see if she was ready, I still don't think she was. Just don't be to hard on the kids if this method doesn't work. They may not be physically ready."
2,Good for some.....but not for ours!,"The training went quite well for the first two hours. Our 2 year-old son was able to learn to pull down his pants, sit on the potty, pull them back up and empty the potty in the big toilet. He did have a couple of accidents during this time, but handled the ""accident training sessions"" quite well. He even managed to successfully expel a couple drops of urine during a few occasions, but never fully emptied his bladder when he sat on the potty. Instead, he chose to ""fully"" pee when he was elsewhere resulting in very wet pants. Things became very traumatic for him later in the day when for some unknown reason he began to be very hesitant to sit on the potty to the point of crying hysterically when asked to sit. We're not sure why this happened. All of the specific directions outlined in the book were followed meticulously, but to no avail. We'll be trying another method in a few weeks when our son has recuperated from this ""training"" method."
1,A sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline,Absolutely dreadful compared to Lenny's 1960's Copland recordings on Columbia (now Sony). His 1960's Copland recordings are monumental. Avoid all his later Deutsches Gramophone dreck. These are only a sad testimony to Lenny's post 1970's decline. Used copies for sale for 27 cents should tell you something.
1,Good product - bad vendor,"I ordered two of these boxes. One was defective. The vendor promised to replace it, but I have never received the replacement. I'm just out the money."
1,never got them!!!,"i oredered these and the box came with a reciet but no product, i contacted the seller and they ssaid they were sending me some but its been 3 weeks and i dont think they are coming. This is the first time amazon has ripped me off everything until now has been good but now i dont know if i would order from them again"
2,Surreptitious Calvinism,"Resembles the Thompson, but has somewhat different themes. Whereas the Thompson is an objective bible, [ie, the Thompson allows scripture to interpret scripture] this Thematic Bible intrudes the editors' Calvinistic opinions and interpretations in bottom-of-page commentaries."
4,cool early getz,"Cool aloof and early Stan Getz with his glorious sound!There is another three CD set of Getz from this period the ""Complete Roost Recordings"", for $45 or so which more or less duplicates this. This one gets slight nod for the selection and sound (and it's 2 brothers), but if you have ""Roost"" and ""Quartet"" you don't need this version, also.you can only pick between albums by song selection - some are ballads some are upbeat - all are Cool!recording quality is all over the placeBy the way, the ""Complete"" Roost does not have all of these recordings, despite the title. Roost sound quality is a little better. Song selection is better in this collection, I think."
2,There are better books out there.,The book is more of a sales catalog then a handloading digest. A lot of the information is from the product sheets you would receive if you purchased the products. Little is provided on actual reloading technique. It would be better to borrow a copy or find one at a library. After you peruse it once you will not need it again.
3,Good but not great,"For the cost I am glad I bought this book, however the subtitle is misleading. This book is more of a ""survey"" of reloading equipment and techniques, which is very helpful; but I wouldn't buy this to teach yourself about actually reloading. A good add on to a reloader's library, but a beginner should get other more detailed manuals on the subject for actually learning the basics."
4,NOT FINISHED RADING,"WELL WRITTEN and for the money just great. Quite a lot of info, will probably take me months to finish as I only read it before falling a sleep at night ( half hour to an hour a day) by my KINDLE. Glad I bought it, good info. Will update this after finished reading."
2,"OK book, for ideas at least.","I've read through this book and found it a decent book for ideas about various tricks to teach your dog. However, it gives you very little info about how to train your dog! Nor does it prepare the unitiated with the typical responses that you might expect from your dog during the initial training phases, or how to react to various situations.Finally, the book is dated. Written in the late 70s it doesn't cover newer trainer methods. Some of there methods could really use updating (i.e. there is very little in the way of motivational training, mostly corrective training is used. If you and your dog want to have fun shouldn't it be a little less work for them?).I highly suggest skipping over this book, unless you need help in new trick ideas and are confident that you and your pooch can work well together.There are a few other books out there that are newer and stress the fun aspect of dog tricks much better than this one did."
4,"Great book, nice ideas, lack some detail","This is an almost complete training book. It give some nice ideas to train your dog. The amount of ""tricks"" given is very nice. Some of them are easy to teach, some are extremely hard. The info is prersented in a humorous way making the book not only good for teaching these behaviors but also fun to read. I can not say this is a complete book because it doesn't explain ways to deal with some basics problems that all trainers, myself included, encounter. For this reason I don't recomend this book to a beginer trainer. Experienced trainers will appreciate all the ideas presented. It give some entertaining ways to spend time with your dog."
1,Waste of time...,"Great, a no talent AKC judge whose claim to fame is getting pets ( not his ) into the movies thinks he can train dogs. Well, he can't, and that's pretty obvious from his crappy writing.Save yourself some money and skip this one!"
5,This book is a blast!,If you have a smart dog (like my Bo Diddley-LOL!) you will love teaching the tricks described in this book to the delight of your friends and family!! What a fun book!!
4,I contiune to enjoy robotham's work (again),"i've really mucked up the order of this series in my reading, however that doesn't really damage the enjoyment of each individual book. perhaps if i go back and read or listen in the proper order, i notice more, however taken out of order, they are still great novels.compared to boomproof, suspect lacking a bit, but again, i listened to the audio book, rather than reading the text, and i did quite enjoy the pace, language and composition of the text in boomproof.i'd say this for me is a 4, but the overall series is quite enjoyable and i would give it a 5 for potential."
4,Great Book......Though Complicated,"I too listened to this book. I found it great from disk 1 to disk 10. I do not agree with the other reveiwer that Robotham was being critical of George Bush. The book did mention ""W"" but was far from a soap box speech! If you like British culture and a good mystery, you will not be disapointed."
2,A C- Thriller,"I listened to the Books on Tape edition of ""Suspect,"" which I checked out from my library. That's a good thing because if I had spent my hard-earned dollars to actually buy it I would have been furious.As another reviewer has noted, the book contains gratuitous savagings of George W. Bush and his administration. Is it unreasonable of me to have been put off by Robothan's political commentaries? After all the man is Australian and his experience as a ghost writer and fledgling thriller writer would seem to leave him ill-equipped to comment on United States politics. Worse, the book is a muddle and not terribly exciting.If you can get the book from your public library, especially on CD so you can listen to it while driving or preparing a meal, I marginally recommend it, but if you would have to spend money for it, look elsewhere. I gave ""Suspect"" two stars only because, despite his weaknesses as a storyteller, Robothan is a skilfull writer."
4,great first book,"I liked the book - for a first it was really good.There are some errors in the editing for sure, but that didn't keep me from enjoying it.I will read the rest of his books."
3,Not Bad,"This book is entertaining but I did not enjoy it as much as ""The Wreckage"", ""Say You are Sorry"" or Bleed Me"", this is just a personal opinion. I found it a bit slow to get going but the story did pick up as the book progressed. I would still read more of his work and recommend him as an author"
4,It will keep you guessing,A good yarn that is well written even when it gets a little slow at times. Also the product of some research
4,Great read,First time reading this author. Caught my attention from the start. I like the way this author writes. Enjoyable read.
4,Up there with the best,This is the first time I have read this author and I was spellbound by his presentation. Every chapter had me hurrying to the next. Looking forward to his other publications...Top marks.
3,A solid exercise ball,"This ball is very solid/hard. I didn't want it for exercise, I wanted it to bounce my baby who had colic! This ball was a little firmer than what I like. Even letting some air out, it was still very firm. If you're looking for bounce or flexibility, I wouldn't get this one. If you just want a stable surface while doing sit-ups, etc... this will be fine."
2,Too small,"I was surprised at how small the ball was. If you want to buy this ball, please measure your height. If you are taller than 5'3"" or have long legs, you may want a larger ball. Now I have to go to the trouble and expense of returning it and wait even longer for a new ball by another manufacturer."
3,dvd deflates product,the content of the dvd is practically useless for the exercise ball itself. i actually gave the dvd away!
5,Swamp Thing rules......,"Swamp Thing rules... even though this is a campy movie The Return of Swamp Thing is fun. If you like superhero, monster movies and camp rolled into one then this is the movie for you. The best part of this movie is the opening credits with that rock and roll song. This is one of the better Superhero movies... 10times better than THE Captain America, Fantastic Four and The Punisher movies that were never release. Right up there with Batman Returns and Superman 4."
1,Nothing like the original,"This movie is terrible in every way possible known to man. The story is weak, the effects are like something seen in a holloween parade. There is little effort in tring to convince you in believing it is real. Don't even let your dog see this movie."
3,looks more like so so TV,did not finish the first movies plot and the more adult theme of the first and the better acting of the first film...worth a watch but only ok movie.
2,Don't Buy!,"This is not a good item. It does not punch 75 sheets, maybe half of that and I have to put my full body weight on it to get the punches to go through. I've had it over a year now. GETTING REPLACEMENT HEADS AND DISCS ARE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!! I even tried the manufacturer. They gave me the part # but couldn't sell it directly to me. They referred me to Staples. I spent half an hour on the phone with a rep trying to track it down and EACH PUNCH PIN COSTS $32!!!!!!!!!. Ridiculous. Save yourself some hassle and buy an electric punch. Costs more but well worth the money."
5,Middle Eastern/World Fusion music fans will love this!,"Creative and original fusion of Turkish, Persian, Eastern European music. Sonja Drakulich's voice touches the heart and, rather than being a focal point of the music, seems to blend in like a beautiful melodic instrument. The music of Stellamara can be grouped with bands such as DCD and VAS, yet they definitely have their own distinct and unique flavor. You will not be disappointed."
4,It was good!,I really liked it and all but I think the 2 latest ones are better....I am a year over the age limit and so can read 2 spooksville books a day if I have the time to sit and read I really liked the book...
4,Creature in the Teacher,It is number thirteen in the Spooksville series. It can best be described as V for children in that the monster this time is a reptile from outer space.As this book comes so late in a series the characters are established and no time is wasted on reintroducing them or their world. So coming to this book without having read any of the previous was like hearing the punchline without the joke.I haven't read any of the other books in the Spooksville series but I can see that I would have probably enjoyed the lot of them when I was in elementary school.
4,'You are there' unique descriptions,"Along with 'you are there' unique descriptions of the recording experience comes details on the music industry's motivations, mbaqanga artists' struggles for professional and political voice, and a discussion of how studios have changed in post-apartheid South Africa."
4,Great little camping generator!,"I just received my order today for the Triron 2HP generator. I attached the handle, poured some mixed gas in the tank and it started after the 3rd pull. I tried running a hand grinder but that was a little too much amps. I tried a 1.15A Dremel tool which it handled no problem. Then I tried a 6Amp Black & Decker drill and that was no problem either, although I could hear the generator load down a little. The manual recommends not exceeding 300Watts for the first 3-4 hours, so I am just going to burn through a tank of gas before really trying anything more. Overall I think this will be a great camping generator which is what I bought it for. I would recommend this for camping or low amperage devices. BTW, it really not that loud compared to my Brigss & Straton 6300 Watt generator or even as loud as my 2cycle gas powered weed wacker! I think it is easy on the ears considering its a 2cycle engine. Overall the generator feels well built, but time will tell on that."
3,great for a year.,"This helped my laptop live another year, but not much longer. It now has to be plugged in all the time. Battery is spent."
3,good value for the price,"I have had life jackets before for other dogs. I paid a lot more for them and they were a little nicer (padding on the straps, more form-fitting), but also more expensive. I think this is a good value for the price. With a little adjusting, I molded the vest to fit my dog's body better. The straps don't seem to irritate her skin, but she doesn't swim a lot with it on. I have a lab, so it's not like she really needs it for swimming - it's mainly a precaution when we take her on a boat and also helps us get her back on the surfboard when we take her surfing and she falls off (the handle on the back is handy). Anyway, good value for the price but definitely a ""no frills"" option."
3,Starman did it better....,"Director Nico Mastorakis blames director John Carpenter for stealing ideas from The Time Traveler for his film Starman. No doubt there are some similarities, but overall Carpenter did it MUCH better. This film portrays a person from the future (not an alien) traveling back in time and is taken under the wing of a family. He needs their help to get back to his own time or he will die. If you can find this cheap, then go for it because it isn't too bad of a film. Otherwise spend the extra and purchase Starman instead."
3,Time enough for love,"An American widow (Adrienne Barbeau) moves to a Greek island with her son and their dog. She makes a simple life away from technology. One day while traversing a deserted stretch of beach they come upon a naked man (Keir Dullea.) He apparently washed ashore. On his back is an imprinted magnetic number. They befriend the stranger give him cloths, drugs, money and sex. In return they find out where he is from and that he just missed seeing his brother by two days or two millennia.Can he ever go back?If so will he ever return?What would you do?The story is more a study of human nature than it is sci-fi or time travel.You may recognize Keir Dullea from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Of course we all recognize Adrienne Barbeau as Dr. Kurtz in ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" (1988). ""We eat our men"""
2,okay not what I thought it was,This movie was not the movie I thought it was but it was okay for the money I would rather have something else.
2,"Kind of a low, low budget starman ripoff.",I bought this DVD because I'm a big fan of Adrenne Barbeau.Boy is she hot. One sexy lady. The movie isn't too bad. This one would be good for younger kids.Pretty good DVD transfer.
1,Why bother?,"This is a fairly bizarre publication based on a French version first published 6 or 7 years ago. Unfortunately, this is no better. It seems organised only to provide an outlet for notes on some arcane aspects of French anthropology. Certainly, the sections dealing with American and English anthropologists have been covered elsewhere, and better. I can't see the justification for buying this book and certainly not for the high price, when the level seems aimed at undergraduates, who will get a banal and very standard view of the history of the discipline that can be found in any introductory textbook. A waste of money and time reading."
4,Unusual Perspective,"It's difficult to imagine that a modern reader would find an inquisitor a sympathetic character. But he was sincere, believed in the rules of evidence, despised corruption, the abuse of power and the use of torture. I did think that this very admirable character had too much faith in the system, but it was interesting to read a book about an inquisitor with such good intentions."
3,"does this book make MDC a ""somebody?""","He said the reason he shot John Lennon was so that he'd be a ""somebody"" instead of a ""nobody."" He said he'd always wanted to have a book written about him. Is this book just feeding his narcisism? I sort of think the book can't decide whether it wants to be a legitimate psychological portrait or sensationalistic. The highlights of the book, for me, were the chapters ""All the Lonely People"" and ""Fan Mail."" These chapters examined the culture we live in that leads people to obsess over famous people. I was disappointed in the book because I thought it would examine that more than it did, and also because it glamourized Mark David Chapman. I mean, it includes a short story he wrote. I don't care about that, I don't care about HIM. I care about the sociological and psychological factors that made him do what he did. I don't want to know his life story, and I REALLY don't want to empathize with him."
4,Where is Mark David Chapman today?,"Why has this book not been reprinted? Parole December, 2000? Jones' book recorded death threats towards Mark Chapman. Where is he today? Why is there no press coverage of his impending release. Would you like to live next door to this man? Well in less than a year that will be a possibility. My searches on the web have so far come up fruitless. Anyway, the book appeared to be objective and was an interesting read for anyone who was a fan."
2,Would it hurt just to have the book IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER??,"I mean really. Going from Chapmen's past, the present, the past, its giving me a headache when i try to read this thing. Go read Who killeD John Lennon if your desprate for Chapmen's life, but please dont read this book."
1,Junk,This book was nothing more than an attempt to capitalize on John Lennon's death. The man who killed John Lennon wanted this book to try and further his spotlight.I started to read this book and realized this after I realized it was telling me nothing. I suggest turning you back on this kind of gross attempt at fame and fortune.
4,Indispensible C&O companion to towpath exploration.,"Thomas Hahn is clearly one of the biggest Canal enthusiasts I've ever had the pleasure of reading a book by. This volume is set in uneven type that keeps changing in weight and size, and some of the information appears a few years out of date, but with those caveats this fine book is every penny worth, and definitely belongs in the collection of anyone with an interest in the C&O Canal, its stories and towpath structures. Ideal as a back-pocket handy guide to things to see, each and every culvert, lock, house and spill along the Canal are described and annotated in meticulous detail with photos, information about their construction, materials used, history and current state. Book may if not here be found at C&O park offices."
5,Hee-sterical,"This DVD is absolutely hysterical. Yes, she slams celebrities which at first is what you'll find funny because her take on these encounters is a trip. The more you see her, hear her, you learn that it is the way she articulates her insights, her delivery & her expressions. Much like Dennis Miller who, while he has great material, is terribly funny because of his delivery. Kathy is right up there with Dennis Miller in my book. Too many female comedians rest the laurels on man-hating rants or jokes about their hormones. Kathy doesn't take any easy roads. ALL of her stuff is so original and funny and fresh and an absolute hoot. You can't go wrong with this DVD. My boyfriend loved it & he didn't know who half the celebrities were she was making fun of. Great DVD."
2,So this is comedy?,"My friend recommended this video because of all the hoopla on Bravo about Kathy. I suppose if you believe the stories she tells are true, it could be funny. If watching a comedian ripping apart another person makes you feel better about yourself, its a must. After reading all the reviews here, all I have to say is Kathy, you should bless the day you met Clay Aiken, because whether he likes it or not, he gave your career a temporary boost. It is rather funny to read the ""claymates"" here who think they're sitting at the ""cool table"" because they go to your shows. Kathy's celebrity stories are mundane andboring. I doubt if any celebrity loses any sleep over what she says but I guess its fun for her fans to think they do."
2,ho-hum,"The Bravo show was funnier and a lot less disgusting. I was hoping she would be more vicious when it came to Gwyneth. And the ""battle"" with Barbara didn't seem like a very big deal. But she found a promising niche. If she keeps at it, she might one day produce her own ""Bigger and Blacker"" that hits all the right notes."
1,Shocked!,"One reviewer here who gave this 5 stars also gave Nick Lachey's album 5 stars, enough said!I am truely stunned that so many people find this thing entertaining. Firstly, she looks like a guy in drag so much so infact I believe she's actually a guy! Secondly, how can someone become so famous for sucking so badly? That's just crazy! She's truely painful to watch, and her standup routine isn't even really standup but more like her telling dumb stories with no punchline.There is no way these reviews can be real, there's just no possibly way. They have to be paid hamsters tapping away daily writing bogus reviews or just total morons or both. There is just no possible way that this many people can think this lady is funny.If you enjoy going to the denist, fingernails down a chalk board, the squeeking of an unoiled door and anything else annoying as imaginably possible then this is for you!"
1,"Mean-spirited, foul mouthed ""humor""",Don't waste your money. I don't blame thecelebrities for not wanting to be aroundher. She's very mean and nasty and isproud of it.
5,Hilarious!!,Love being able to watch Kathy unedited and no commercials. Hate it when they bleep out all the curse words on regular tv. Love her!!!
4,enjoyable! Allegedley!,I really think KG is one of the funniest comedic personalities of this genre - The DVD was great! I would have never know about it except I watched her Bravo show religiously & I now can't get enough of her! The only downside to the DVD was that it just wasn't long enough - Give us more Kathy 'Griffiths'(Griffin)!!!!!!
4,The D LIST,"While I am Still SO hoping they will release the DVD version of the routine she did on BRAVO called the D LIST, I have to say I LOVED Kathy in this stnad up. I LOVED her shots about Paltrow (F HER!!!) She cracks me up. I love her no holds barred attitude. She calls it as she sees it and she doesn't cow tow to anyone! Kathy is one funny woman!!!!"
1,Dissapointed,I always thought she was funny when i seen her on talk shows etc. But there is just to much language in this for me. I've seen others that curse alot but it seems to fit and give a laugh but she just seems like it's her favorite word. Guess i'll stick with Wanda Sykes...T J
1,Kathy Griffin is Amazingly Boring & Bitter,"OK Kathy, would you please come up with some new material already? And, while you are at it, lets try something that is genuinely funny rather than bitterness towards others couched as humor. Lose the bitterness, and Kathy might have some potential but I doubt that will happen as it's gotten progressively worse."
5,way beyond funny!,"I absolutely love this dvd! Whether or not you are a die-hard Kathy Griffin fan, you should seriously consider getting this dvd- it will convert you to a ""Kathy Griffin fan"" if you aren't already! Uncensored, hilarious, and honestly one of the funniest shows I have ever seen!"
4,wicked since of humor,"Some people thank Kathy Griffin is mean, but she is just giving an exaggerated point of view about celebrities, except for those she really hates. KG is willing to skewer even those celebs she loves like Oprah and Sharon Stone. I love her Sharon story and the fact that she cops to the fact that some of the audience bought into the hokey performance. She also acknowledges that many people find her over the top. If you want to hear how seriously some celebs take themselves, and others who can let it roll off of them, then try this dvd."
4,WANNA LAUGH OUT LOUD?,"If you want to laugh hard and loud, check out Kathy Griffin's uncensored live concert ALLEGEDLY (Anchor Bay).The D-List Diva offers her hilarious, irreverent and profane take on her stint as red carpet host at the VH1 Awards, her USO tour to Afghanistan, Brooke Shields' wedding and an unsettling encounter with Barbara Walters on live TV.In concert, Griffin empties herself of ego and pretense. She is self deprecating and fearless in her revelations and she has a wicked gift for sharing her perversely twisted delight in the bizarre, pompous and even dangerous behaviour of her fellow humans."
3,Okay,"Her best jokes, which are included in a story about her on the red carpet, are fired off at the beginning. After that the DVD goes downhill as the jokes get progressively less funny. I love her show, which is why I bought this, and it did not live up."
4,"Kathy Griffin ""Allegedly""",Kathy Griffin at her best!Very funny standup by one of the funniest women inentertainment.
5,LOVE IT!,"Kathy is SO funny, it hurts! I cannot wait for her next DVD. If you need a good laugh, get this. It's awesome!"
3,Special Features,"Having seen this movie in theaters, I'm wondering what special features besides the commentary might be on the DVD. Thanks, Donna"
1,Ash Wednesday,"As an Elijah Wood fan, I stupidly spent the money to buy the DVD ""Ash Wednesday"" thinking that if Elijah was in it, it would be worth spending the bucks to see more hours of 'that face' on my television screen. Boy, was I wrong! What an awful movie! And frankly Elijah didn't do well in it because he didn't fit in! Surrounded by dirty, bitter, foul-mouthed losers, he could not quite find his niche. Further more, the storyline is ridiculous. At times it seemed that dialogue was being invented...which actually would be an easy undertaking by depositing a particular four-lettered verb between each and every syllable. If you like Elijah as I do, skip this movie. Buy the much more superior ""All I Want""."
3,"Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return","-Genesis 3:19 In a fictional early 1980s NYC's Hell's Kitchen, rumors start circulating that Francis Sullivan's (Burns) younger brother (Wood) has returned to the neighborhood. Problem is he's been presumed dead after gunning down a few local gangsters several years before, now the Irish Mob wants him really dead. This film, only released in two theaters and grossing less than $3,000 - really isn't too bad at all for the most part. It holds your attention and has a terrific 80s rock/metal soundtrack. Burns, Platt, Dawson and a few of the other actors are great. Wood is horrendously miscast, so is Malachy McCourt as Whitey the crime boss. But funny dialogue and good setting outweigh the at-times somewhat wobbly script and some poor casting choices. If you liked this then check out the real thing, readThe Westies: Inside New York's Irish Mob. Slan."
4,great potrayal of Hell's Kitchen,tis film about Irish-American life in hell's kitchen. the only flaw is that i thought elijah wood was a miscast. he sounded like one a' those fruity college boys arounf the Irish toughs. now i'm from Canaryville in Chicago which is similar 2 Hell's Kitchen. It is the biggest Irish neighbourhood prolly in Chicago(its on the South Side) and its a pretty toigh neighbourhood. so i like how it reminded me of that. if your big on the Irish or just wanna see a good crime drama get this film it kicks ass
2,Edward Burns and Elijah Wood fans would like this.,"I'm an Elijah fan, so I went out and rented this movie as soon as I found out about it. The plot is pretty interesting, but is drowned out by the movie's overabundant shots of Edward Burns walking dramatically down the street to the movie's redundant soundtrack. I must admit that Burns does a pretty convincing job in his character, although I'm not really sure if that is attributed to his acting or because he may actually be like that, since the last Burns movie I saw was ages ago. Rosario Dawson gives a pretty good performance in this movie, as does Elijah Wood. The only complaint I have about Elijah's performance is that he lacks the tough New York accent that Burns (who plays his brother) has throughout the movie. I'm not sure that if they grew up together, why Burns' character has an accent and Wood's does not. Oh well."
2,"Unengaging,","When I read the synopsis on hbo one night and saw that it would be on shortly, I was more than looking forward to seeing it. I'm a huge fan of good cinema and of everything Irish. Almost immediately into the film it was clear it was a let down. Two medicore performances from the main characters heavily contributed to this. Just not belivable. At some points I felt like I was watching a novice scene being played out in an acting school. Wood really stunk and was actually annoying, and Burn's nonchalant approach might have been to nonchalant. Lackluster performances aside I kinda liked the story Idea. I think the movie could have had some potential, given it was handed over to some writers/directors with a little more potential than Burns. The high point of the movie may be it's cinematogrophy. This one's worth skipping."
4,big edward burns fan,since i am such a big edward burns fan i didnt hesitate to watch this movie and it has to be on my top 20 lists of fav movies. very great twists and turns
4,DNAngel... second print,"Just a note for future buyers, this contains the very same 26 episodes as the DNAngel box set. It's not a Vol. 2, just a new design, so more like a VERSION 2.The only reason I didn't give it five stars, is because of it's confusing label as a different volume. This is a wonderful anime and I very much recommend it."
3,Overpriced!,"I was going to price this online, after looking at it in Best Buy tonight, only to find that Amazon is asking $80 for it. It was $30 at Best Buy, which is a good price for a compact series set, as I would expect to spend between $30-$50. The $80 price tag on this is laughable."
4,Strike Anywhere,"Not the greatest vocal quality but obviously if you know the songs you can follow along and understand. The other instruments sound good and the video quality is good. I haven't watched As Friends Rust and don't really intend to. I wanted this all for Strike Anywhere and wasn't disapointed with the DVD. It was cool to see SA just starting out (only Change is a Sound and Chorus of One had been released at the time). My favorites are You're Fired, Sunset, and My Design. And it's always interesting to hear what Thomas has to say. I'd say buy it used, especially if you're a SA fan.As Friends Rust SetlistLike Strings (Spell it with a K)MorningleaverHalf Friend TownPerfect StrangersThe First SOng On The Tape You Make Her14 Or SoRuffianLaughing Out LoudEncanteCoffee BlackHome Is Where The Heart AchesStrike Anywhere SetlistYou're FiredCassandratic EquationTimebomb GenerationS.S.T.EarthboundRiot of WordsRefusalChorus of OneSunset on 32ndMy Design"

5,Incredibly Motivating Fitness Calendar Encore!,"I have the 2005 and 2006 Streaming Colors Fitness Calendars. I LOVE the 2005 version and wanted to keep up the inspiration. (I already know that I will get the 2007, 2008 and on and on... as well!) The colors keep me going! My family and friends are loving theirs too. They are a great present for yourself and your loved ones. The calendar is full of tips to keep you going, I love the goal setting and rewards sections! You could use it for any aspect of fitness; exercise, eating well, increasing your water or fruits & veggies, tracking your blood sugars if you're diabetic, your blood pressure, etc... You should definitely check this out!"
4,elton john two rooms,i have this vhs tape wich i find very interesting but i would like to get the dvd format i hope to get it soon...
4,Two Rooms Portuguese edition!,"When I received this DVD in the mail, I found strange packaging. Turns out that this is a Portuguese version. So the packaging and the DVD menus are in Portuguese. HOWEVER, the content of the DVD is in English and matches the original video release from a few years ago. Yes, this will play on American DVD machines.The 4 stars is because of the Portuguese (I had to think a bit to translate ""legendas sim"" to ""subtitles yes"").The quality is not DVD-caliber quality either, but that's because this is niche material. However, it is comparable to a good video.Elton, as ever, rocks. :)"
3,Too ambitious,"This book is more of a how to pick color and design than it is practical. Yes you get to see close up details of how to sew and design covers and window trappings. Yet it is not really a step by step and it is up to you to connect the dots from the how to to the what to.A few color photos, a lot of monochrome photos and black and white diagrams. There are 120 pages with an index but no glossary.There is no a new insight or unique processes. This book is too simple for the knowing and too vague for the neophyte."
3,Integrated spam is a problem,I just cancelled my Kindle subscription to Forbes. I have been a subscriber to the print version in the past and have had the Kindle version for about 6 months. I agree with the other comments concerning the poor graphics but that was tolerable. What was not tolerable was the recent issue. Included in virtually every story was an inserted offer to subscribe to the print version of the magazine. This offer was not at the beginning or the end or between articles but was randomly placed within the text of virtually every article. I found this disrupted the flow of the article and extremely annoying.
1,A Pricing issue,"I just received an offer for a year's print subscription to Forbes for $21.99. Or, I can subscribe via Kindle for a year for $30.00...over 1/3 MORE. With the Kindle edition, the publisher doesn't have to print or mail yet the costs are higher. Duh. The content is the same (excellent) but the Kindle edition is inferior in pricing, and, from other reviewers, in formatting. USPS here I come."
3,Good Magazine for Business Generalists,Forbes is generally a good magazine for business generalists. It's not the latest or the greatest in terms of detailing but it is pretty comprehensive and insightful in it's agenda.
2,forbes,Way overpriced for this publication. Just a few articles of questionable worth. Needs to reinvent itself and get away from the same old stuff for elevated prices.
2,not so good,I am very disappointed with graphics. I wish i could read it with my Kindle for Apple Application. I tried Kindle version and decided to stick with a paper one.
4,Excellent Source of Business Information,"I highly recommend Forbes for insightful business articles about companies, people, and markets. This combined with the Wall Street Journal gives you a great wealth of information and all without ads, walking to the mailbox or getting ink on your hands. Saves all that paper and trees too. Be green - read on a Kindle !"
1,Not a Dick Cheney fan,"I will admit that some of the stories are good. But, I am just going to stick with Businessweek. What is bad about this magazine is the commentary that Steve Forbes sticks in there. Obviously the intended reader is a ""Faux News"" fan. Let him continue with his pro-Cheney agenda without me."
2,Not all as advertised!,"An interesting report, but my gripe is about the very misleading description and the price. It is only 8 minutes long, which makes it about $2.00 per minute. There are no additional stories at all as the description claims. This was the case with another 20/20 DVD that I bought from Amazon."
2,More of an attaboy for the author than good info for the new artist,"I was looking for a book that demonstrated BASICS on painting techniques such as palette selection, brush loading and stroke techniques. All he showed or described were single photos and one short paragraph on the topics I wanted. This was certainly not sufficient to launch me confidently into the area of landscape art. Painting and drawing skills are acquired by practice, and no book will make you an instant success, but the book was boldly listed as BASICS and one would think that it should thoroughly demonstrate or describe very basic methods and techniques. This book was a big disappointment. The topics and techniques discussed are repeated in other Yerry Yarnell books. That makes it seem that his series is just a cut and paste reprint of a basic framework where he substitutes landscapes in one book with sea and water in another. I won't buy another Yarnell book. There are others that cover what I need much better."
1,Very poor,"we received our Enviracaire HEPA filter #24000 in extremely bad condition - out of 4, 2 where completely damaged inside the metallic part meaning that WE CAN NOT USE IT it goes directly to the bin!!!!!! I am really upset because the transportation packaging and the original packaging are not damaged at all which means that they sent them ALREADY in bad condition! these are for my allergic kids....THANK YOU!"
1,It stinks.,"While it installed with no problem, when I turned the air purifier on, the air it put out smelled like smoke. I called the company to return it and was supposed to be sent a return label. It's been 2 weeks and I still haven't received the return label. I'll have to call them again."
3,Rare and Unique Spaceships Inside,"Starlog Photo Guidebook to Spaceships. 35 pages. 1977 printing. Magazine style format. This covers spaceships of all kinds, starting from woodcut images to early paintings, to movies and TV. The kind of ships we have come to know began with 1936's Flash Gordon serials.This magazine mentions a lot of ships and movies I had never heard of. Unfortunately, most of the images in this mag appear to be degraded 'screenshots' from film and TV, though some are in color. Quite a bit grainy. This may have been a limitation of color printing in the 1970s, I am not sure.Still, it covers the history of spaceships on film pretty well, right on up to the late 1970's. If you are curious, or nostalgic for 50's, 60's, and 70's spaceships, this would be a good choice and a quick read."
1,Oh Please,"Whenever I get this impression of a book 1/3 of the way through it I check others reviews and find quite a few with similar feelings. I thought I was reading Danielle Steele, who I have given up on because of her repetitious driving of her point across. So they are living with a lot of angst, get on with it. Should she try to save Beth, cause she couldn't save Glenda? Will Nick turn out to be another guy to do her wrong even if she feels such a strong attraction to him? Can he ever forgive himself for not making Alyssa wear her helmet. Stay tuned for the next chapter in this soap saga. No one wants to tell anyone anything but they are all sure trying to find out everyone's secrets. That's a small town for you, you can never outrun your past."
3,Average Story,"This novel was just okay. I like the premise. Women on the run from dangerous man. Goes to new town to start over. Meets new guy who is still having trouble getting over his first wife. While they adjust to each other, she still has to be wary of the ""dangerous man"" she ran from. This novel did not flow well for me. If I love a novel I can usually read it in one sitting. I kept getting bored with the dialogue and sitting it down and then picking it up again. I guess I was expecting a little more action in the novel. Still, the characters were likeable, the story line was predictable but flowed. I guess I would recommend."
4,Cats loved it,We have two cats. We had an older one which one cat was using so we decided to buy another one. The cats both wanted to sleep in the new one so we have bought a third one. Cats love to curl up and since they sleep on our bed this has helped contain them in a smalled area. Great purchase for us.
3,Not very plush,"This bed isn't bad, but it's not as cushy as I'd like for my cats. And there's no removable cover, so you can't wash it."
4,Intimate concert with my favorite band,It was like I was standing in the crowd in Italy. Great made DVD and the band is better than ever.
4,GREAT DVD,"Great documentary about the 2006 visit to Italy, great perfomances of new songs, plus incredible images and photography.GET IT NOW!"
4,Just what I wanted,"I got this for my Husband, we are big Pearl Jam fans. This DvD is amazing. Great footage and an excelent set list."
1,Not the Pearl Jam I remember,They look tired and this dvd is boring....the crowd also looks very board..... Not a strong energy filled performance by no means. Pearl Jam sucks.
5,For new christians and christians who are struggling with their deliverence,This book is a must read if you are a new christian or one who is struggling with their walk with God or if you just simply need to be renewed. I encourage you to read this book. Dr. Summerfield has a gift for teaching the word and making you understand it.
5,All you need is a good brainwashing,This is an awsome book for everyone who needs to get there life back together. I have seen so many peoples lives changed after reading one of Frank Summerfields books. He has organized the book so it's easy to read. This book should be required reading for every Christian!
5,Compelling and Comprehensive - Highly Recommend,"Filled with practical advice, this personal account of caregiving for elderly parents is a must read! The author skillfully relates to readers by honestly conveying the gut-wrenching decisions one faces when caring for parents during their final years, months and days. I recommend this book to anyone currently caring for much-loved elderly parents or to anyone who may find themselves in this position someday. One can easily sympathize and empathize with the author, Barbara Winters, as she invites you to experience the joys, trials, heart aches and blessings of caring for her beloved parents. I highly recommend My Time to Care."
1,cutters that don't,"I purchased both the Bessey medium duty offset cutter and this Heavy Duty version. The heavy duty version seems essentially worthless. The medium duty is perfectly nice and works well. The difference in design seems to be that the medium duty is all metal construction, while the so-called heavy duty version has steel blades, but everything else is plastic, and may deform enough when you meet any significant resistance so as to screw up the blade alignment, which is of course critical on a by-pass cutter. (Yes, I'm guessing here) Even the mechanism that allows you to lock the blades in the closed position for storage broke within a week."
5,sausage at its best,great sausage expensive but well worth it and they always throw in extras with each order
1,Weakest so far,"This is by far the weakest volume in the series; George seems to have completely lost her way with the main characters in the series, and there is virtually nothing of any interest here. The musican protagonist (Gideon) is hopeless, and as for his family, forget it."
2,A Puzzle To Memory,I have read and enjoyed the previous works in this series. The characters are complex and story lines held my interest and attention. I found this newest entry a challenge. I was nearly finished when I discovered that the plot moved back and forth in time. It was very hard to get a handle on the story. I also did not find any of the characters sympathetic. Finishing it was a let-down. It felt like a lot of work for a little pay-off.
1,A real disappointment,"Normally I am an enthusiastic fan of Ms. George, but this book is confusing and full of whining, one note characters. Of course a mystery novel must contain some unpleasant characters, since the reader has to believe them capable of murder, but they don't have to go on grating on the nerves for hundreds of pages.Long before I finished this book I was hoping for a mass murderer to come along and wipe out the entire mopey cast.I can only hope that Ms. George will return to her usual fine form in her next novel."
2,Great author; Bad mystery,"I love Elizabeth George and look forward to every new installment in this series. Unfortunately, this book disappointed me. I don't mind that the usual suspects, Havers, Lynley, Simon and Deborah, are sidelined. I understand that the author might be becoming bored with their stories, and I feel that we readers could use a break from them. Lynley, in particular, is becoming too sanctimonious and hard to take in large doses. For me, the primary problem is the mystery. It was very unlikely in the first place and you can drive a Mack truck through the holes in the plot. You could be forgiven for finishing the book and still not really understanding whodunit and why."
2,Where was the editor?,"I've enjoyed all of the previous Lynley/Havers books, but was greatly disappointed with this one. First of all, it is about twice as long as it needs to be. The plot meanders all over the place, with too many loose threads and contradictions. The basic characters, with the exception of Winston, don't show us anything new and are hardly part of the story. The writing on the other hand is pure George, a pleasure to read, except for the growing disappointment and frustration as the plot frays apart.A good job of editing could have turned this into a worthy book. As it is now, I am sorry I wasted so much time on such a frustrating venture."
2,Disappointing compared to earlier books,"IF this were the 1st book for Elizabeth George, then one could cut her some slack and assume she would improve. As the 11th in the Lynley/Havers series it is disappointing. The plot meanders too far away from the main series characters, treating them quite superficially. The other, quite annoying tendency, is the repetition of Catholic imagery, guilt, blah blah. If Elizabeth George wants to write religious books (which she does in her off-season from Lynley/Havers), then keep the heavy handed Catholic stuff to the other literary works. Overall........after waiting a year for a new novel from George, this was very disappointing and an indication the series is sliding downhill rapidly."
1,"So booring, and so sad she's dropped this far","I'm a George fan. I've read all her prior books in the series and loved them. But this one has bogged down in flipping back and forth between viewpoints that may be taking us somewhere eventually, but not soon. She's tried a technique of story telling that got out of hand; a good editor would have made her cut 200 pages. It's been laying on my shelf 3/4ths done for two weeks, and may well stay there since other reviewers say that the ending doesn't resolve what happened.Sigh. She needs a break. Then she needs to think about the series, and a coherent story, and how to tell that story, and if she is capable of telling it well."
1,Who wrote this book?,"700 pages of a book in a series defined by Barbara Havers and Lynley and we get a story about Gideon and the murder of his sister 20 or so years earlier. Gosh, was the editor on vacation? A red pen was clearly needed in this book. While I can understand EG trying a new twist on writing, she should have started with a whole new set of characters instead of polluting her great series of Havers and company. I missed Barbara's mussings. They were needed. Also, the mystery was disappointing."
3,a traitor to memory,"An obese woman is mowed down by auto, a crime that will be repeated several strategic times in this mystery. The victims are not chosen at random. Inspector Lynley and Barbara Havers are called in to investigate. Their research leads them to a child prodigy, now a has-been, Gideon and his family and their extended friends. The case of his nanny for drowning his baby sister is reopened and revisited, as it might have ties to themurders. Most of Gideon's family and friends are hiding a secret that may lead to unlocking the mystery, especially Gideon himself, whose repressed memories might just be the final key needed. to solve it."
3,Whatever happened?,"Not only was I was disappointed in Traitor to Memory, mainly because of the drawn-out dialogue between Gideon and Dr Rose, but I had been hoping that Havers' relationship with Azhar and his daughter Hadiyyah (In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner) would develop into something other than ""neighbourly"". In fact Havers and her boss, Lynley, took a back seat to a procession of awful characters. Saying all that, the book was still brilliantly written and I look forward to George's next one."
2,Very disappointed in Elizabeth George's latest book,"When I began reading ""A Traitor to Memory"" I was so disgusted with the sexual descriptions I could not believe this was Elizabeth George. I put the book down, but later thought I would stick with it to see if it improved any. I did finish reading the long book, ploughing through Gideon's boring one-sided sessions with Dr.Rose, only to be rewarded with the stupid ending.There was too much from Gideon, his sex-crazed friend Libby, and his father Richard and not enough from Inspector Lynley and Barbara Havers.I hope that George will go back to her roots with Lynley and Havers, and skip all that sex. We didn't need it before, and we don't need it now."
3,Slogging through Memory,"Although I finally finished it, I must say that it became somewhat tedious. The story never came to a very satisfying end, and I disliked most of the characters (except for Lindley et al). The time frames became confusing and who did what to whom never really was answered well. Unlike previous books by George, this one seemed too labored and psychologically muddled."
3,disappointed in the last stretch,"I love Elizabeth George's writing---so much more in depth than the usual mystery novel---a thorough exploration of the characters and an authentic, albeit American voice behind the curtain. I didn't mind that Barbara Havers had a tertiary role in this one. ..I didn't mind that Viscount Linley showed his feet of clay even more than in recent books. I did mind that, after staying with the book for over six HUNDRED pages that George falsely resolved the book in the last fifty pages---and as a life-long string player, I found the ending almost comical (but I won't give it away here even though I hope that no one starts with this book)"
2,"Talk, talk, talk","I started reading this series because I was interested in the five main characters. Instead, I am finding that in the past few books, the author isn't featuring them as strongly as she had in her earlier novels. She is now writing very uninteresting, talky storylines which portray too many boring people. What happened to Lynley, Helen, Simon, Deborah and Havers? They seem to be thrown into the chapters as an afterthought. I think their interwoven relationships were more enjoyable to read about than the other characters in this long-winded novel."
2,Get a Life,"I've read and enjoyed other Elizabeth George mysteries and I like the smart but pathetic and hopelessly unfashionable detective Barbara Havers. However, after struggling through the interminable interior monologue of a 3-year old violin player that opens this book, I thought: why in the world am I reading an over-stuffed mystery novel that is 700 pages long? Don't I have something better to do with my time? Well, I do -- I'll read a biography of Jesse James who was at least a real person and a criminal of some note.Take this review as a protest against 700 page mystery novels. A mystery should be brief and tight -- capable of being read and enjoyed in a day or two.Smallchief"
3,Not as good as the others,"I am a great fan of E. George's and have read almost all her previous books. As a thriller it was quite good, and I read it at a fast pace to finish it and find out who was the murderer. The book had a number of positive aspects to it: very good character portrayal of Gideon, and his mother and the psychological analysis as to why he developed his phobia is quite convincing. But there were a lot of repetitions and details which slowed the naration at some points, and made it somewhat boring. The motivation to the murders was not quite convincing, and at a few points I got the definite impression that George confused the times of the narative(no wonder since she kept taking us to various points in the past and then bringing us back to the present). The ending also left me with a bit of disquiet and dissatisfied. Overall, A Traitor to Memory is quite thrilling, and interesting compared to other writers of the same genre, but not as good as George's previous novels."
3,Disappointing,"I've been reading George's Inspector Lynley novels, in order, and this is the only one that's disappointed me somewhat. It was overly long and it definitely dragged, which is surprising given that these are usually major page-turners. I think she tried a new technique with this one, using flashbacks and playing with time and memory. It's an interesting approach but it made the novel feel slightly disjointed. Furthermore, I found the characters hard to warm up to, especially Gideon and Libby, two of the major characters in the plot. I think she gives Gideon's self-analyzing psychological journey too much time at the expense of Lynley and Havers, and the way he speaks and thinks is hard to imagine coming from a real person or social dynamic. I got so annoyed by Gideon's pompous discussions with his doctor that I really couldn't enjoy the plot itself that much. And finally, I think the plot is a real stretch, and is never fully explained."
3,Frustrating,"This is the first Elizabeth George book that I found frustrating, irritating and distracting. There were a few too many flashbacks, especially Gideon, and by the end of the book I could not tell whether I was reading in the present or in the past. Maybe this effect was intended by the author, but it spoiled the book for me. I didn't care about the endless sessions between Gideon and his psychiatrist or about his journal entries. I buy Elizabeth George to read about Lynley and Havers, Deborah and St. James, and the suspense of how the latest murder will be unraveled. I've actually written in the past about how well I thought George managed to bring all the different threads of her story together at the end to create closure, but I don't think she succeeded this time"
2,Bad editing.,"I join the ranks of reviewers who are ardent George fans, but were disappointed by this book. While the story line may not be up to the high level we normally expect from Elizabeth George, the main problem is the editing. One example - the timeshifted tracks of Gideon's diary and the rest of the story is definitely confusing, but our confusion is exacerbated when the dates don't add up. We are told that Katja was released 12 weeks before Eugenie died on Nov 19. Yet she was apparently at the fateful concert on 13th July.Did the people at Bantam read the book at all?"
3,TOOO LONG !!!,"I went on vacation this summer to my mother's house in Florida. She had gotten two new books for me to read--""A Traitor to Memory"" and P.D. James latest. I started reading Elizabeth George because she is one of my favorite writers and I usually thoroughly enjoy her books. However, this book was way too long!! The same plot, characters and all the ramifications could have been told in 500 pages and been a much better book. I guess what I don't understand is why the publishers, her editor, etc. don't/can't tell an author that they have ""diarrhea"" of the pen and the book will suffer for it. Because this one did--it's way too long. By the time I was finished I really didn't care who had done what--I was thoroughly bored with the whole thing and just wanted it to end. Please somebody, tell Ms. George to tell the story faster next time. I'm sorry to say that I really did not enjoy this book and hope that her next book is better."
4,Many interesting pages,"Over 650 pages by Elizabeth George! What more can one ask for? She's done it again, and I want more! I must know what happened to Webberley and of course to Gideon and Katja!MORE! MORE, NOW!!!"
1,Traitor to memory,"A confused mess. The only author that can write for 700 pages and keep things moving well is Charles Dickens. This work needed a good editor, after a while I took out a red pen and exercised alot of the mess."
2,Nothing duller than psycho babble--what a disappointment!,"The reason you pay a shrink upwards of $65/hour to listen to your endless droning about emotional garbage is because who would do it for free?? To pay for the priviledge of reading the same kind of claptrap disguised as an Elizabeth George novel--she obviously ""experimented"" with this tome---is a hardship. I particularly resent the fact I saved this book for a long airplane trip. The ending was stupid, to boot. Skip this!!"
2,intrigue,I read most of the book and really enjoyed most of it. There wasnt many explosions but there was plenty of fizz.
1,It breaks my heart...awful!,"What a relief it was for me to read the three reviews before me! I have always loved George's books...but she must have written this one too fast...I've been struggling with it for two weeks..usually I read her books in two days...and usually I love every page. In this case, I keep getting bored...and now that I've read those reviews I can stop reading...if the ending is that bad, I'm going back to my new Ian Rankin!"
3,"Oh, the slogging!","A sage piece of writing advice from Elmore Leonard, a man who has earned the right to give such advice, is: ""Try to leave out the parts that readers will skip.""Oh please, please, next time (and I WILL read the next Elizabeth George book) don't make us slog through so very MUCH detail to find the story. I love character development as much as the next person, but not to the exclusion of plot! Poor Gideon's troubles could have been distilled down by at least two hundred pages. The diary device grew so tedious.E. George thanks her editor, Kate Miciak, at the end of the book. I think Ms. Miciak did the author a disservice by not insisting that she tighten up the novel. But that is the risk you run when you become a successful author, I suppose: you (and apparently your editors) don't believe you need editing."
3,"Eeew, it's a shrink session....","This departure from my favorite mystery writer's style was not worth the read. The ending was extremely disappointing and after I read it, I thought, ""Oh, no, she's never going to write a good book again, and I loved her so!"" but fortunately this wasn't true. Whew. Sigh of relief. I would not have minded the length, if I didn't hate reading the interview- and inner process-type chapters. Plus it was spotty and disconnected feeling and there were few people to like. I would rather discover the creepy character's motivations by just doing my own story deciphering. Anyway, skip this one if you want a typically great E. George mystery novel."
2,An Usatisfactory Ending,"The ending of the book was most unsatisfying for me. Libby didn't behave as her character did throughout the book. Gideon doesn't get his question answered, unless holding Libby down by the shoulders as he'd done his sister long ago is his answer? What happens to Webberly and his wife? What happens to Richard? What happens to Wolf? For such a complicated book I was very surprised at its ending. Elizabeth George is such an excellent writer I wonder why she allowed this to be? I would not recommed this book to a new reader of George, but one reviewer was a first time reader and liked it a lot; go figure?"
1,A Traitor To My Money,"This is just as bad as Zandie Smith's ""White Teeth"".(Why do I have this rotten luck of picking works byfemale writers who are full of ""blah"" and no substance?)I can't believed I wasted my money and time on this.At the risk of giving the plot away (and I'm not surethere is one.... after ploughing through pages and pages,I don't care anymore), the one star awarded is for theend of the book where Gideon's girlfriend destroyedsomething of his -- it seemed so hilarious to me thatI laughed out loud.This is my first Elizabeth George novel. And I intentto make it my only one. I have better things to dowith my time."
3,Hmmmmm......,"When I finished Traitor, I wondered if Ms. George was referring to the author. I finished the book last night and couldn't wait to see the reviews. I haven't read them all, but so far, they pretty much echo my sentiments. I'm fairly bright and I was in grey-matter shock over what I was beginning to believe were MY inadequacies. I love detail and more detail, so that was fine. I love Great Big Books. Fine. I love dabblings in the human mind. Fine. But I also like good research and while Ms. George made few errors, they WERE there. I'll be buying her next book -- except for I, Richard, which is merely a duplicate of the same book with a different title -- but this latest novel needed HELP -- and to think I have the hardcover......"
3,Next please....,"I am a major fan of the Linley/Havers series, but ""Traitor to Memory"" was a big disappointment. Tommy & Barbara were peripheral characters, and a 'major' plot twist was very obvious to me early on in the novel. Said plot twist was concelaed with cliche devices such as character psychosis and dream analysis. The novel was tedious and at times confusing due to the dual narration.Also, this EG novel was badly in need of some more editing, it could have been reduced by at least 100 pages.Although it has to be said, even a bad EG Linley/Havers experience is still one worth reading. I am addicted to these novels. So, next one please...."
1,Not Elizabeth's Greatest Book,"I'm a big fan of Elizabeth George's, and waited a long time for this book to come out.I was very disappointed in this book. It was too long, and the storyline dragged on very slowly and wasn't up to her usual standards.I waded through the entire book, only to be extremely disappointed by a bad, bad ending.I hope Elizabeth's next one is better."
1,Give this one a pass!!!,"As an avid fan of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley series (see my June 10, 2000 review of ""In Pursuit of Proper Sinner""), I pre-ordered the 11th entry of the series and waited anxiously for it to arrive. It is a terrible disappointment--it is very long with a tedious plot--with much first person dialogue of the main character in a journal for his psychiatrist. There is very little new with my favorites--Barbara Havers and Inspector Lynley--and it is the development of these characters that have made the series so successful. There were no other interesting or likable characters in the story to keep your interest. The ending is so unsatisfying I forgot I finished it and thought there was more.If you liked George's earlier novels, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. I hope her future novels return to her winning formula of character development and tight plots."
2,Too much gratuitous sex,"I have enjoyed Elizabeth George's mysteries in the past even though they don't compare to the likes of Ruth Rundell or P.D. James - but this one was not good. It was choppy and substituted grapic and gratuitious sexual scenes and language for a seamless plot and quality of characterization. After I read the last sentence, I thought - ""who cares"" and felt like I had wasted my time reading a potboiler."
2,not her best,"I was very disappointed in ""A Traitor to Memory."" I loved EG's previous books, but I thought this one featured very long and long-winded soliloquies from a repellant and boring man who was responding to an old fashioned Freudian psychiatrist. The book is based on the extremely dubious premise that in general people tend to forget very traumatic events, something recently shown to be highly quesitonable, and surely against commonsense also. I should say that I put the book down one-third of the way through; perhaps it got better, but by then I had guessed too much."
2,"Gab, Gab, Gab!","First of all, like most books this one started off slow, but not just slow, ungodly slow. I think the overall point in this book was to make it just as long as possible! For 1000+ pages, there is about 5% content, the rest is 2 detectives not coming up with anything. You could seriously read the first 50 pages and last 10 and wash out the rest of the 900. It's to say the least FRUSTRATING. You keep thinking it's going to get juicy, but it just sits there and people keep TALKING. The worst of all, the ending is just horrid. Smart girl that wrote the book, likes to show off her fancy vocabulary, but Please do yourself a favor and save your money."
2,It's A Plod. Surely Elizabeth George's Next Will Be Better.,"I cannot elaborate any better or further than the previous reviewers of A Traitor To Memory. Having read and enjoyed previous novels in the Lynley-Havers series, I entertained lofty expectations of this latest book by Elizabeth George. However, it required a supremely concerted effort to grind through the ponderous text, plough on through the cumbersome plot, and endure the maximum insult delivered in the conclusion of this tepid tome.Back to P.D. James and beloved Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine for the holidays. I would advise fans to do likewise. Spend your precious reading time enjoying the masters of the genre or cozy up with a few of Sue Grafton's mysteries and your Christmas will be merry and bright."
2,so disappointed,"NOW I know why reviews are written on Amazon by customers. It's really helpful. I am still mulling in the book, wondering if I'll ever get to the end...where is she going with this..why do we need to beat this up one more time? I really think the tripsy back and forth is making me dizzy and certainly has detracted from my reading enjoyment."
3,Paying by the word...,"I confess to being a fan of Elizabeth George. I have read the majority of the books in this series so clearly, something draws me back. However, I also confess to being disappointed overall with this effort. First, and foremost, it is TOO LONG at over 1000 pages. Second, the mystery is quite minimal here and I'd figured it out by page 200 or so. It was pretty much a task to slog through the rest of the book just to confirm what I already knew. As usual, her writing is lucid... maybe too lucid if it was not much of a mystery. I was also disappointed also in the character development in this novel. Usually, such great attention to detail is spent on describing even the slightest of characters in her books. But incredibly, given the length of the novel, few of the characters were fully realized. Last, the returning characters... Lynley, Havers, Nkata, et al were all pretty much ignored with regard to development. Hoping the next one is better!!! KSK"
2,A Traitor to Menory,I did not think this was her best book. The last one fourth of the book was hard to follow and at times the pages seemed to be out of order. Onearea of the book the police are the first to tell Gideon his mother is dead. Then later in the book it appears the father is the first. I would be hard pressed to recommend this book to anyone.
4,Violin Violence,"Weighing in at 1006 pages, this tale describes a young violinist prodigy's struggle to find out with a psychiatrist, why he is blocked from playing. Sgt. Haver and Insp. Lynley play relatively minor roles. Some of straight-arrow Lynley's miscues are inexplicable. A Californian's speech is perfectly mimicked. The narration alternates among the violinist, his family and the cops in inspiral fashion, giving the reader the feeling he's learning of each event for the third time and muddying the chronology. While the plot as a whole is credible, the ending is not."
2,A Traitor to Faithful Readers!,"We all wait faithfully for the next installment of the Lyndley/Havers series...and get a book that barely mentions them! The plot was hopelessly transparent, and if George had not used the flashback/flashforward technique it would have been even worse. I am glad I read the book but only because I would hate to be lost on the small bits of information of the usual main characters' lives. Hopefully we will get to see more of them in the next book. And we can all hope that George will decide to go with a slightly shorter book next time so she can tie up all her loose ends before her deadline. And it will give us a book before waiting a year again!"
1,Most boring book,This book is much too long to keep the reader's interest up. The characters are hardly believable and Linley and Havers are on the perimeter never helping the story.
2,Whew! done at last,"I love E.G. but this one is way too long, confusing with the diary entries, too many loose ends left hanging and just plain boring in parts."
2,Expect the Unexpected,"If you're a huge EG fan, as I am, this book will not be what you've come to expect from her series. It took me a few weeks to blast through her entire series -- I was hooked at Book One. So, this new one was eagerly awaited, but sadly it disappointed. It's hugely confusing, and really didn't present any sympathetic characters. The lack of detail about Havers and Lynley left this book feeling flat. I think Peach (the St. James' dog) had more exposure than St. James."
5,Elizabeth George at her best,"I must say I am a loyal Elizabeth George fan but how this book slipped my notice I do not know. So glad I was able to read this one too. It was probably one of her best works. Always kept you guessing from the beginning........which I love. Inspector Lynley and constable Barbara Havers are at their best. All Ms George's ""Inspector Lynley"" series are worth reading."
3,Much to do about nothing,Just did not quite pan out after such a long read. The ending was a convoluted as the beginning. I was disappointed - too bad!!
2,Tedious,"I have read all of the Thomas Lynley books and enjoy them. I admire Ms. George's writing. Having said that, this book is, quite simply, tedious. There is far, far too much time devoted to Gideon's stream-of-consciousness rambling directed at his analyst. I found myself skipping over many pages of these segments of the book. Not your best effort, Ms. George!"
3,"A Rush Job, but Slow Read","Elizabeth George's A TRAITOR TO MEMORY needs an editor with a strong finger on the delete key. The book is much too long and plodding for the material. For a fan of the series it is a must-read, but allow yourself plenty of time because the pace of this title is plodding at best.Everyone gets a view of the life of Lynley and his wife Helen, while Havers is down played in this volume.Nash Black, author of QUALIFYING LAPS"
3,Like a bran muffin - -a bit too dense for me,"I do love a good Elizabeth George mystery, but this one was just too darned long for me. If it had been more compelling, the length wouldn't have bothered me. But the fact that I figured out ""whodunnit"" in the first couple of chapters made the slog through the next 700 pages a little tedious.I also found myself getting lost in the timeline -- the storyline would move forward, then Gideon's writing would go back to the distant past as well as to a few days behind the rest of the story.Overall, it's well-written and well-plotted. Just a bit too fiberful for this reader."
3,"Great Story, Disappointing Resolution","I read this book on a trip to the Far East, and at times couldn't wait to get back to the hotel to see what was going to happen next! E. George introduces character after character, plot twist after plot twist, and it was all fascinating.When I was getting near the end of the book I started to worry--how is she possibly going to resolve all the issues she's created? And, that ended up being the major problem with the book: unclear, slapdash resolutions of highly complex characters and situations. I felt the same thing happened in ""For the Sake of Elena."" But this time it was far worse. One of the most interesting, put-upon and tragic characters (Katja)is left hanging. I'm beginning another George book, but am almost afraid to start really caring about the characters."
4,A True Psychological Thriller!,"This was my first Elizabeth George book, and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was given to me as a gift, and I thank the person for getting me started in this series. Now, I will need to begin at the beginning. Ms. George can write a very good psychological thriller - along the lines of Minette Walters, but less creepy. She is an excellent author, and really knows how to develop her characters. I find I really want to get to know her two protaganists - Lynley and Havers. As I was reading it was difficult at first to keep the two storylines apart, but once I mastered that, it went much better. I felt so bad for Gideon. What a terrible thing to suppress things in a child. It causes all kinds of problems for the adult. The book is long, but it goes quickly. The writing is excellent - a true thinking-person's mystery."
3,after the wait...,"since reading IN PURSUIT... in 1999, i anticipated greater focus on havers in this book! while webberley and nkata are wonderful characters, nobody holds a candle to barbara havers with her fabulous fashion sense and ability to smack lynley with reality. i hope the next book develops her character even further.ms george's writing is as richly textured and reliably enjoyable as ever. however, gideon davies was deathly dull as a narrator and character. i kept hoping he would sprain a finger thereby triggering a rush of memory with the pain and taking us readers more quickly to the resolution."
5,Another outstanding entry in a fine series,"This is a non-stop page turner from one of the best mystery writers around. I especially enjoyed the way Elizabeth George uses a major character's diary to show the process of psychoanalytically oriented therapy and the psychological changes he went through as his repressions began to unravel. If you like great writing and psychological insights, I highly recommend this book. This is a series with very interesting continuing characters, so if you enjoy this one, give yourself a real treat and read the series in order."
2,What a disappointment!,"It's hard to believe the same woman who wrote previous Lynley/Havers stories wrote this book. Lynley and Havers hardly appear, and when they do their personalities are sadly absent. Ditto Helen, Deborah and St. James. The dialogue seems not quite right in places (if you are violently ill with morning sickness you're not likely to be chatty), and around page 600 the chronology of events becomes rather garbled. I found the time-jumping confusing, distracting and not effective. Still haven't quite figured it out.Don't buy this book! Wait till it comes to the library, and then read it if you feel you must."
1,Disappointing effort,"A very disappointing effort from a usually dependable writer. At least half the book is occupied by the ramblings of the violinist Gideon Davies, which does little to create tension and makes Lynley and Havers almost cameo figures in a series in which they usually star."
3,"Very Good, but...","I am a huge Elizabeth George fan, after having started with ""A Great Deliverance"" about 6 or more years ago. I have read all her books in order (I recommend doing this, as they build on one another.)I liked this book (and read it in a long weekend), but agree with many other reviewers that:a) it was too long. There was alot of superflous dialog and details that should have been edited out.b) the psychological journaling of Gideon's was very tedious. I had real trouble getting into this book (because it started with the journal), which has never happened to me before on an Eliz. George book. It took me almost 100 pages to really become interested. I found the tone of Gideon's journal to be petulant, goading, and all around annoying.c) the ending BUGGED THE HECK outta me! I felt that the act in question was out of character and completely superflous.But, hey, I liked it, warts & all. Elizabeth George is one of the best!"
2,A Traitor to Memory,"I have read all of elizabeth george's mysteries and looked forward with anticipation to this one. Her writing as always is riveting and her book is hard to put down. This book is over 700 pages. The time line takes a while to understand and get used to; eventually it is understandable. BUT; after 700 pages all of the loose ends in the plot should answered. Two of the hit and run attacks are never clearly explained, and the timing of the first seems to have occured too soon to make sense. The reason for Eugenia Davis being sent to the address of her hit and run is also never explained. 700 pages is too long for this good a writer to have this many inconsistencies. And, my God, what does the ending mean?"
2,Traitor to Memory,"This book was too long and the cutting back and forth between Gideon's view and the rest was tedious beyond words. The timeline was hard to follow, as was the plot. I've read most of George's mysteries and think her early books were the best. And where were the publisher's editors? One of them needed to cast a critical eye on George's writing and rein her in."
2,Betrayed By A Favorite Author,"Elizabeth George is among my favorite authors and I ordered the book immediately upon being informed that it would be available. What a disappointment to have a book filled with uninteresting, in fact repugnant characters, overly graphic references to the cybersex culture and a frenetic leaping back and forth in time, place and perspective. I didn't like any of these people enough to try to keep track of them and skipped long sections hoping something would grab my attention. It didn't.The real mystery is who wrote this book? It is so unlike Ms George in every way that I have to wonder if SHE were the one murdered and someone is writing in her place."
2,An off-year for George,"Every writer has his or her dogs and we may forgive them if their past entries have given as much pleasure as the majority of Elizabeth George mysteries have done. This one falls under that heading of excusable (but don't let it happen again). There are enough meanderings and red herrings to exhaust even devoted fans, and a plot so mundane and well-tread that on page 50 you dismiss the ultimate solution as too obvious, not worthy of George. Of the recurring characters, Nkata gets the major spotlight while Lynley and Havers drift in and out to less effect than is the rule. At 722 pages, this book is in drastic need of an editor with a pencil; George is good but even she needs an editor."
2,A doorstopper,"I really should give this 2.5 stars-- George's skill at unraveling the mystery is balanced out by the book's bloatedness.I've enjoyed this series in the past, but my problem with this book is that I simply didn't like any of these people. The violinist, the father, the pregnant girlfriend, the voyeur old bookshop owner. Too many characters are 2-d , given only a crass character trait for development. Also, George refuses to be kind to Havers, her own heroine, whose fashion faux pas are played for low comedy. That said, the key revelations are planted with great subtlety and skill. For hard core fans only..."
3,Convoluted and slow,"I found this book to be a very slow read and extremely heavy going.Obviously it still managed to hold my attention as I plodded on to the end but....all that psychological twisting and turning grew very wearisome and by about the 3/4 mark, I was hoping for it to be finished.A brilliant violinist,a former child prodigy,has a nervous breakdown and with the help of a therapist,tries to remember the happenings that lead up to the death of his Downs Syndrome baby sister in childhood.His whole family has neurotic tendencies (for this read ""Bunch of Nuts"") and the entire book is woven around these rather eccentric and totally unlovable people.I suppose the fact that I didn't like any of the main players in the book,contributed greatly to my boredom with it."
3,"Too long, too slow","I love Elizabeth George and would read her grocery list and be entertained, so saying bad things about this book makes me feel disloyal. It was too long, and hard to get intested in, it moved slowly and I got to know some characters too well, while missing the characters I love getting to know more about, i.e. Barbara Havers, Deborah and Simon, Helen, and all their intricate connections from the past. Please, Elizabeth, keep their stories going and let us have their characters keep growing and changing...let them ""star"" and the story and new characters be their setting and scenery and cast. I love the England you portray. I lived there for a year in 1985 and thoroughly enjoy the vocabulary and the well drawn English-isms, and the fleshed out, yet stereotyped people I actually knew and called friends. Your books are my favorites! I am always anticipating the next one!"
2,"""Better"" is the worst enemy of ""best""","Elisabeth George is one of my favourite authors and I've read all her books so far. Nothing needs to be said about her excellent characters, wonderfull language and imaginative plots. This time Elisabeth George tried to do better and ended up with a book that compares very badly to her previous ones. It is too twisted, with an uneccessarily complicated narrative which makes it tiring to read. Our beloved characters play a minor role, the plot suggests that the writer possesses a rather disturbed mind and the end leaves a bitter, sad and hollow aftertaste. Evidently Elisabeth George is a victim of her own success as she tried a new recipe without having the guts (as Grisham did with ""The Painted House"") to entirely abandon the old one. Everyone is allowed a mistake once is a while. I do hope that Elisabeth George gets back on track both for her own and her readers' sake."
1,Expensive product,"I regret that I dident look more before I bought thios book from this company, I find later thath the book is for sale for onely 12 dollars and I paid to this company 125 dollars."
5,Excellent!,"A great read. This book is a great resource for fishing certain bugs. You can read a short chapter in a short amount of time. Ralph Cutter writes so one can understand his techniques, yet doesn't compromise the technical aspects. Like the ""Go To Fly"", this is my new ""Go To Book"" for learning how to fish certain bugs."
2,Broke after two weeks,"The SolarShield's temples taper to a very narrow width, which breaks very easily. The plastic there feels like very cheap plastic, like a disposable fork tine. I have had other glasses from this company and they worked well until I scratched them up too much.This pair fit well over my priscription glasses and did a good job on the sun's glare. But again not very durable."
1,drops wireless connections,"This router worked fine until it began to drop wireless internet connections sporadically, sometimes a few times a day. It's not so obvious when this happens, and Windows does not detect any error. I found I had to reboot the router to regain connectivity. The router still apparently works well for wired connections. I bought a buffalo wireless router several months ago. It has never required a manual reboot and has made me a happier person."
1,Moronic customer support,"I returned this router one week after purchase. After experiencing some set-up difficulties, I spent (literally) hours on the phone to absolutely clueless customer service reps, who tried to blame the fault on everything but the router. Most of them were clearly reading from a manual and had no idea about basic software issues.I returned and exchanged for the equivalent Linksys model, which also gave me a set-up problem (related to the previous mess Netgear had made of the system). I phoned customer service, and found them very knowledgeable and competent - a very stark contrast to the buffoons at Netgear. Bingo, they fixed the problem right away!Bottom line, the Netgear router has an easy set-up and good range, but if you ever need to phone customer service, you are in for a nasty surprise."
4,Security software effects a lot on the performance,I installed this router for a week already. It's a version 4. The installation and set up really is 100% foolproof because I am not a tech savvy person. Good thing I read the reviews before the purchase so I followed the firmware upgrade instructions rather than ignoring it. The 2nd day it started loosing connection very frquently on one computer but on my Toshiba satellite it works beautifully. My toshiba uses Mcafee and the other uses Kaspersky (I am not too thrilled about this software because it blocks almost everything to earn it's reputation as the most secured internet security software). However starting from day 3 even the computer that disconnects slowy gets better. I guess the router has a break in period and its performance will be greatly effected by the internet security program in your computer.
1,Useless Software,"This router comes prepackaged with some of the most useless software I've ever come across. I bought the WGT 624 (v3) to replace my broken D-Link DI-514. Thought it was a bargain at the time of purchase - an illusion quickly shattered.The router's forced auto setup first incorrectly detected my cable modem settings, telling me I had a Static IP, when my IP was being dynamically assigned by Comcast. Internet connection only came after two or three reboots. And here's the rub, the vaunted work-through-walls signal people associate with this brand couldn't even register at full strength when I was sitting 2 feet away from it on my laptop. I took my laptop downstairs and the signal dropped to 24Mb/s (down from 48 when I was 2 feet away).I returned this router the next day and got myself another D-Link, DI-524. Within 10 minutes, I had a full strength wireless signal throughout my entire apartment - upstairs and downstairs.Stay away."
1,You could just burn your money instead.,"or Why Linksys Isn't WorriedIt seems like a great deal, but the Netgear WGT624 is a dud. After installing it, it worked briefly, but the first thing the web-based control page suggested is a firmware update. Big mistake. After the update, the router kicked off any connected PC after 2 minutes. I've spent hours on the phone with the polite but incompetent support people, reset everything, restored a previous version of the firmware, all for nought. Netgear's final solution was to suggest that I return the router to the store - but it's past the store's exchange period. I wrote them of this, CC'd the CEO (Patrick Lo) and have received no response at all. Sure, it's cheaper than a Linksys, but the Netgear is way too expensive (and too lightweight!) for a paperweight.Basically, Netgear has no interest in upholding their guarantee, or supporting their customers. Linksys has nothing to worry about."
1,Cheap and useless,I ordered this item thinking it would be as easy to setup as my Netgear B router. Not only would it not sync with my cable modem but the router itself looks like a cheap knockoff. I have a custom antenna for my B and was looking forward to the added speed but it seems Netgear has cut corners and added a non replaceable antenna. Avoid this item.
3,Works okay.,"I brought this refurb wgt624 v2 from compusa a few days ago for a very cheap price. I checked out the reviews and it wasn't so great but I ended up buying it anyways because of the price. I updated the firmware and enabled wep 64 bit encryption and it worked okay so far and didn't experience dropped connections so far. Despite its small antenna, the signal strength is better than my older linksys befw11s4. The only complaint is that it does have a slower speed between when 2 computers are connected together using my cat 5 cable than my older linksys befw11s4 802.11b router. I'll keep my fingers crossed whether my router craps out in the next few days. I am giving it 3 stars because I have low expectations for this router anyways."
2,Very disappointing....,"BOTH Netgear WGT624 and its service were poorly. I had owned a Netgear b, it didn't have good signal. So I decided to upgrade it to a Super G to get more range. However, I didn't get good range as well. The only room I could receive signal was in the same room where the router was located; nowhere else! More surprisely, the router needed frequent reboot. Worsely, I had a strange problem where my laptop could receive signal but my wired desktop had no Internet connection.But the worst thing was that Netgear only offer 90 days telephone support. You have to write them an email for products older than 90 days, and they only reply you by email. After tried several email back and forth by weeks, my problem was still not solved. The technical support stuff transferred me into another department, where they didn't contact me for more than 10 days!!! Finally, I decided to give up on Netgear. I will never touck this brand again!!!"
3,Works okay but...,"After returning first unit (would not broadcast signal) was able to setup without problems. Have WGT511T 108Mbps PC Card in notebook but have to use WG121 54G USB adapter with other desktop PC since Netgear has no 108Mbps adapter yet. Sometimes desktop has trouble logging in and I have to power cycle the router and then okay. Having trouble getting Linksys WGA54G game adapter (with PS2) to connect and can't find any solutions from Netgear, Linksys or Sony. May have to wait on router firmware upgrade (already using latest 3.0.2)."
1,Horrible Rounter,"This product has (like with many other reviews) stopped working around month six, I would also like to confirm that it does drop the connection and require a reboot about every six hours... do yourself a favor and buy a compeditors product"
1,Keeps dropping the connection,"I've had this for several months now. It worked wonderfully for a few months with a continuous connection, but now it drops the wireless capability every day. I have to switch it off and turn it back on to get it working again. Some days it will drop off line every five minutes. I am very frustrated with it and am considering taking a sledgehammer to it."
4,"Good, but not perfect","I got the Netgear WGT624 after lots of problems with a wired Linksys cable modem/router combo unit. It installed easily, it is compact, and has a nice setup web page. The feature set is quite complete for a router of this price point, and the wireless system works reasonably well. The wireless is fast, but the range is quite limited. I have a very small 2 bedroom condo, and the wireless doesn't work on the opposite side of the unit. Also, it seems that the router requires to be rebooted every few days.Overall, it's a good product, and I recommend it."
4,Not that great,"Set up on the WGT624 is very easy. The online instructions are great. However for no reason the network keeps dropping and i have to reset my cable modem, the router and restart to get it back on. This happens 2-3 times a week. Not a big deal but it is irritating."
1,No 108MBps - No support,"It looks like there have been others with the same issues I have had. 108MBps does not work and Netgear's support is beyond unhelpful. I replaced another Netgear router for this one and two wireless G adapters so I could get faster speeds. Hundreds of dollars later, I have what I started out with as far as performance goes. Netgear has already replaced this once after a firmware update screwed up the first router. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,"Reboots, Hangs, and Poor Cust Support","I purchased the router back in November. When I emailed support, I got a lot of useless advice. They told me to reload the driver on my adapter even after I told them the ROUTER was rebooting even when I used only wired connections. They told me to get the latest firmware even after I told them I WAS on the latest. Finally, I got them to agree to ship me a new one. Now, 2 months later, the unit is rebooting again every couple of minutes. It even reboots when there's no activity on it. I've since found it that this is a known problem. See for yourself:http://forum1.netgear.com/support/viewtopic.php?t=1238.It's a shame that Netgear appears to be on the decline."
1,"Would rate it ""Black Hole"" if I could.","I bought this router, hoping to upgrade my current LAN to include wifi but could not get it to work. Some users here claim they got up and running with ""5 clicks"" in the setup wizard: After many, many clicks it still tells me that it can't detect my network.I have a Netgear rt314 router already: I tried copying settings across and it stopped working altogether. Reset to default, try again, wouldn't detect any of my clients. Finally gave up and returned it.Netgear has had so-so quality for the past couple of years: I had to return another of their routers the last time I tried to upgrade. Really disappointing; my current RT314 router worked right out of the box, no setup issues, nothing. But it doesn't have wifi and it's getting pretty old so I'm looking for a replacement before it cuts out on me. I'm just going to have to keep looking."
1,Netgear WGT624 Review - strongly recommend against purchasing this product,"The product does not work with cable internet. You have to constantly reboot all the connected equipment (at least twice a day). With DSL and Static IP, could not open port 80.The worst is customer support. Netgear makes it difficult to access customer support. Then there is a wait period of 15 minutes. Then the person you talk to has very rudimentary knowledge of computers and internet connectivity. Finally, they have no idea how to patch you to the 2nd tier of technical experts (connection beaks every time) and you have to do it all over again."
1,"firmware nightmares, surreal tech support","Firstly I have had my home networked sicne I had ISDN ten years ago. I am quite familiar with all the technical aspects as I have aldso had routers and hardware firewalls for some time.The firmware on this unit is problematic, the firmware ""upgrade"" is even worse. Do not bother calling tech support unless you are willing to have someone wo doesn't know a much at all reading off a scripted card insult your intelligence.To top that off range is quite poor. I would wait til the next generation of this product or for them to work out the many bugs.It seems like a good price but if you have to spend hours on the phone with bad tech support it wouldn't be worth it if it were free."
1,WireLESS,"The wired part of the Router works fine, but the Wireless signal was not usable in my home within about a thirty-five feet distance between the router and adapter. Even with a high gain directional antena replacing the Netgear G adapter antena, no usable signal got through! Their Technical support line had very long hold times (around 45 minutes). When I got through to the 'outsourced 'Techies they told me anything to get rid of me. Worse-one immediately hung up the phone when he/she answered (up/down/click)! Worst Tech support I have ever encountered."
4,"So far, So good","Setup was easy and the first thing I did was go and download the newest firmware. I seem to have v3 of the hardware. I took a little while configuring things. Both my wired and wireless computers seem to be working fine. No connection drops, good range. Only dissappointment is that it doesn't seem to have a telnet accessible command line to do configuration like my previous netgear router. So, I've encountered none of the problems mentioned by people here so far. Crossing my fingers."
5,Wonderful Product,"I am using this router hardwired to a Windows Desktop, and wireless with a Mac PowerBook G4 with an AirPort Extreme card. Installation could not have been any easier, and no set-up was even required. The Mac picked up the signal and adapted immediately without even a restart.The only downfall is that the Mac's AirPort card is only a 54Mbps card, so I am not able to experience the power of the 108Mbps router. Signal strength is great through several walls and even makes it out onto my balcony. Highly recommended!"
2,shabby range....,"I had pretty high expectations purchasing this product. After researching many different routers on the internet I thought I would give this one a try because it boasted excellent speed and range. While i can agree it is very fast and works very well within the confines of one room it definately lacks long range performance. I was barely able to get 60 ft away from the router, albeit this distance does require the signal going through two rooms. Tech support wasn't much help and said they don't guarantee it will operate well in other rooms besides the one the router was located in. Not to mention b/w the three calls placed, I couldn't understand one of the techs. They all seemed foreign and really struggled with the english language. All in all my experience with NetGeart was not very favorable. -"
1,It Will Eventually Fail on You,"I have to say that at first this product was amazing, and it worked very well. However, because of the firmware upgrades and possible overheating, the product has now been rendered usesless to me. I may still be able to return it (shipping paid by me) for a new product, but I almost don't even want to deal with the problem anymore, since I know the next one will eventually have a problem. I replaced this with Belkin's Mimo G+ router, and I am happy to say it works beautifully, has a much better range, and has a lifetime warranty. Think before you buy this one."
1,Very unreliable and discontinued product,"I purchased this router expecting great performance, range and security.I ended up being a very frustrated customer, getting used to power cycle this every 2 hours after losing connectivity. It's very obvious that it's all related to software bugs. Nevertheless, Netgear did not release any new firmware to this product for over a year.This is my 2nd Netgear router and been frustrated with the old one yet was too optimistic to try this one. Quality sucks!I'm enforced to buy a new router but this time I'll go with one that supports Linux 3rd-party firmware. Thinking of Linksys WRT54GL.At least I won't have to wait forever for the manufacturer to deliver new firmware (even though it's clear from the support site that there are updates all the time - that's what I call a reliable platform)."
1,A bad product all around,"I bought this because I got a good deal on it at a local store. However, after setting it up and not being able to get the router to work without frequent drop outs requiring a reboot, I went online to check reviews. I was amazed to find that nearly everyone here has had the exact same experience as me. This product must be faulty in its basic design.In terms of the wireless card for my laptop that goes with it, I couldn't even get it to work. After a very frusterating few days, I returned the product and bought a lynksys and it set up like a dream. Flawless so far (only 2 days but still eons better than the netgear product).I would absolutely avoid this product like the plague!!"
1,Only a rental,"I've bought two of these so far, but never again. Both broke after the 90-day warranty but before a year was out. So remember, they look cheap, work great at first, but you are really only renting this box for a couple of months."
4,Good,It's very easy to set up and so far it has been working good. I have internet phone and I don't have the problem being cut-off in the middle of my phone calls. Also the price is good comparing with other stores.
4,Works well for now,"I was reading a review about how this does not work with the xbox 360, and i just wanted to tell anybody who cares that it does. I just hooked it up and played a game of halo. My room is about 50 feet away from the router and i only get 3 bars, which is ok. I also have a ps3 and wii, but have not tried to hook those up yet. the only reason why i gave it 4 stars was because i only get 3 bars, but it's probably something that i did and not the router itself. A good website to check out is cnet.com, they gave it a 7.9 out of 10, which is a good rating."
1,Pure junk,It set up well and work well for a brief period of time. Quickly though it began to fail until it gave up completely. This is pure junk!
4,Easy set up and works just fine,"I am your basic non-computer geek and I got this router set up along with a Netgear card on 2 laptops in about an hour total. It works fine on both I was worried about the interaction with the connection I have to use to get into the network were I work but I didn't have any problems.I set up the SSID and password and all is well. It works in every room of my house, upstairs and downOh yeah, referencing another review: I have a 2.4 ghz phone and I found it had no effect on using this router and card"
2,Defective,"Received it today, unhooked my Netgear RP114 and replaced it with the new WGT624. Setup was easy, but it would never talk to the DSL modem. No lights blinking. Tried different Cat5 cables, nada. Called Netgear tech support and had a hard time understanding the broken english. Could never get anyone to assist me. It's obviously defective so I'll be returning this product tomorrow!"
1,Poor Support Services,"I bought it 23months ago from Amazon. Just recently it started failing to connect with the modem. I called support, after a long delay, the rep came online and wouldn't speak to me before I registered. The call center was clearly overseas and the registration process was quite difficult due to language barriers. After a painful registration process I was then told that he couldn't help me because it was out of warranty...nice. I was given two options: Pay Netgear $32 for a total of 13 minutes of tech support or somehow get online w/out my router and email tech support. Needless to say, the UI on the website was unbearable. Netgear buyer beware YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN."
1,Avoid,"This product doesn't work. Period. It doesn't support the advertised speed. Connections are often lost even with the router next to my computer. Setup is badly designed, it is impossible to figure out whether you are successfully connected or not. Saving settings doesn't seem to do anything. Enough said. Don't buy."
3,Upgrades a Nightmare,"Aside from constantly needing to reboot in order to obtain wireless access, this router performs OK. But here's the nightmare: The instructions for upgrading the firmware include the following:""Before you upgrade write down all current settings as you need to enter them MANUALLY after upgrading""Nice, huh?"
1,Incompatibilty with DSL Modem,"I experienced a problem which can't be fixed by the Netgear or D-link support desk.If you are using an Alcatel DSL modem (speed touch home), Netgear router Wgt624 and D-Link DI 624 are incompatible with this equipment.I bought both and was not able to connect them through PPPoE to my ISP. Both router were returned to the store.My only solution was to return to Linksys standard B router BEFSW11s4.I didn't find any information about DSL modem compability.Hope this review help."
2,wireless woes -- returned for a refund,"this router is far less reliable than the linksys 802.11b router. sometimes the wireless abilities just lock up for no apparent reason, and the router has to be power-cycled. it also resets the lan several times a day, which kicks me out of my vpn connection to remote office. upgrading firmware didn't solve the problems, and netgear's customer support is *weak* at best. i'm ridding myself of this buggy junk, and reinstalling my old tried-and-true 802.11b router. maybe this thing will be stable in a few months, but i'm finished being one of netgear's low-rent beta tester."
1,Doesn't Work With other Netgear Products,"Don't waste good money on a thoroughly mediocre product no better than a super-cheap Fry's special.It definitely does not work well as a network bridge with other Netgear devices. This was the only reason I bought it and spent too much time fiddling with it as Netgear specifies.Routing doesn't work despite the provided options. I don't know what routing as presented is supposed to do, but setting up a route to another subnet on the same switch does absolutely nothing.WPA works, but some of the other wireless options break the connection attempts on a Mac or Linux."
5,Netgear WGT624 Super-G Wireless Router,"The Netgear WGT624 Super-G Wireless Router is an very router to install and setup. It took about 15 minutes to go through the entire setup. once the setup is done, then you have to go into the actual router maint. screen to change the passwords but even that is easy too.i highly recommend buying this wireless router for your home."
1,Piece of junk - resets CONSTANTLY - Poor range,"This product should be recalled.I had a Netgear 802.11b that had good range, and worked flawlessly for a year and a half. It dies. I bought this as a replacement.This router has less than HALF the range of my previous netgear router when used with 802.11b devices. This translates to a range of less than 50' in open space, and 15' in my home.To top it off, I can't maintain a connection for more than 30 minutes with the device and the router on the same desk. The router keeps randomly resetting.To top it off, its getting worse by the day. I'm going to try to return it, either to Amazon or Netgear."
1,Oops...,"Just rec'd the wgt624. Heard that there was a firmware fix from other posts here. Went to check it out. asked for my serial number and I got the following response:Your router has been identified to have a compatibility issue with the current available firmware upgrades. It is an issue that is related to the internal flash memory of the router and additional firmware upgrades may cause it to lose its basic functionality. Therefore, Netgear recommends that you take no additional actions with the router for the time being.Although this affects only a small batch of units, there is currently no firmware or software fix for this issue. As part of the Netgear commitment to our customers, Netgear is offering to swap your router with a replacement that does not have this issue.To proceed with a replacement request, click hereLove that quality control... we'll see if I keep the product, and how amazon handles return policy on this one... I may change my rating later depending..."
2,Can't connect to some 10 Mb/s modems,"When I first tried this router, it wouldn't connect with my DSL modem (as another reviewer stated). After escallating this with a level 3 technician, I learned that the router has problems connecting to 10 Mb/s modems such as my Alcatel Speed Touch Home (at least as of version 1.1.1 firmware). The workaround was to uplink the DSL modem output to 100 Mb/s through a 10/100 switch or hub.Hopefully Netgear will correct the 10 Mb/s issue. Other than that, the router works great!"
1,Failed after 1 week,"Netgear usually has a great track record for dependibility. Unfortunately, this was not true with the wireless router that I purchased. It worked good for 1 week. The 8th day I could not get on the internet. It could not find and IP address. I spent over 3 hours on the phone with Netgear tech support. We tried everything to get it up and running. Finally the tech support person said to return the router and they would send me out a new one. Which is what I did. I hope the new router solves the problem."
1,"Provides fast speed, but hangs frequently","I've been using WGT624 for many months and I am not satisfied with it. It hangs frequently. When it hangs you can't even access the router with a wire (LAN ports). It works only if you turn it off and on. I've always had the latest firmware updates, but none of those helped."
3,Super-G causes serious interference issues,"This router is nice as long as you don't have neighbors.The Atheros chip that Super-G is based on has a nasty design ""feature"" where it uses all 11 channels of 802.11 spectrum, causing problems for neighbors. My neighbor has it and we're trying to solve the interference. Me being on channel 1 or 11 and him on 6 didn't work well. I'm researching it now and I'm hoping that if we turn off some of the speed features we can co-exist. Why make a product that only works as boasted when you have no neighbors?!It has all the standard features and performance seems good, but if you cause problems for all your neighbors, or have to hobble it to be a good neighbor..."
1,Will not allow big files copied from a wireless computer,This is a goofy switch! It works fine for web browsing and I can copy large files from computer to computer when both are wired connections but when my laptop is wireless it dies when I start the copy. Buy a different product....Save yourself!!!
1,WGT624 Sucks Out Loud ... I don't suggest it...,"Netgear is a major name and I expected better. Router has the latest firmware yet it still randomly stops the wireless transmitter dropping all clients. Worse, when you turn on UPNP (universal plug and play) all network traffic becomes unbearably slow ... I have broadband my router should never slow down cnn to the point where I can watch the frames draw in slow detail .... not good. If you turn UPNP off then Xbox Live becomes a roll of the dice in terms of what features will or won't work due to NAT settings that can't be changed manually on the Router. Long story short, I don't recommend it. Save your money for another companies product."
3,"Great router, except when I use my Uniden 2.4Ghz ph","The router is great, I love all the features, range is excellent, and speed is very good...Except when I use my wireless 2.4GHz phone. When I activate the phone the ENTIRE network gets trashed. No connections from any device whatsoever (even if physically connected).This is a horrible flaw for an otherwise excellent router."
1,Junk - buy at your own risk!,"Like others have said here, this router just drops connections. I have had it for about 4 months now and at first it worked fine. I only had an occcasional drop. However, as time went by it happened more often. Now it has come to the point where its unacceptable. (several times a day) I have the latest firmware. And just to humor Netgear, I ran the antivirus software on every computer just like it says on their site, which did not do squat to remedy this problem as every computer was clean. In all it is difficult for me to recommend this unreliable piece of junk. Nothing but a waste of time and money. Also, its been 4 months and no rebate. Just sleazy marketing practice. Avoid Netgear like the plague."
4,MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LATEST FIRMWARE,"Ok first off, I would have trashed this router too as some of the other reviewers have had I written this review a couple of months ago. This router consistenly ""dropped"" connections and was a bear to deal with until I updated to the latest version of the firmware (version 1.XX.14 or something like that as of this writing). Once installed the router has been perfect with no more ""dropped line"" problems.I do think that Netgear should have troubleshooted that problem prior to shipping this router out, but that aside (and I concede it was a major issue), this router works terrific with the latest firmware and has given me outstanding speed and range in my household."
1,Intermittent wifi drops,"Good form factor and easy to set up, but the wireless signal drops off intermittently. It does seem to come back by itself, sometimes in minutes, other times much later (although it's hard to really quantify). Most of the time I have to reset the power. The Netgear user forum boards seem to indicate that this occurs often and is not an isolated event."
1,Works OK but buggy,Works OK but really buggy - connections ALWAYS drops. I have to reset it at least 3 times a week. Updated firmware to no avail...no go! Returned the unit and bought the Linksys WRT54GS router - faster and 100 times more reliable with alot more features.Netgear: Highly NOT recommended!
2,Keeps dropping wireless connection,Bought the WGT624 router with WGT511T wireless card. Updated to latest firmware for both. Wireless connection often keeps getting lost after a few hours of an initially successful connection. Another Microsoft router that was borrowed seems to have no such trouble. Support site on Netgear website not terribly helpful.
5,Ease of Install and use,"Ease of setup and no issues is what mattered to meI have not checked out the features , so cannot rate on thatWhat I wanted was a no issues experience - though I have had to restart this twice over 40 days - happens with most routers and modems, I am happy with the product"
1,horrible,"this has turned me away from netgear forever. It started working ok then every few days something would go wrong. I think it stop connecting to the modem and I had to go in to the router and press save every single time, including when you turn off the model or the router you need to go log into the router and press save to reset the system.DO NOT BUY"
3,Drops local connection!,"This router is easy to set up and works great. But every now and then it drops the connection between the computer and the router if you are inactive. When you put your computer on standby it's not always able to reconnect via network cable and wireless. Unplug the router from power and it reconnects after it powers up. This is unfortunate since it is a great product in all other aspects. It's easy to set up, use, and place out of sight. Most of us use a router to keep our internet connection up all day and just connect to the router as we need with our computers, printers, game consoles, etc... This product is too unreliable when it comes to keeping the local network connection."
1,"wasste of money, time and patience","I had a WGT614 and i was almost happy with it, however i was looking for more range.This router will give you some 5% more coverage at the expense of stop working every two hours ore so. Even with low traffic. The only solution is to reboot it. Which means i have to stop whatever i'm doing, go downstairs (three floors), open two locked dors, reboot the thing, and then go back to work.The net is full of complaints about this router. And no solutions.I should have known better. And Netgear should withdraw this product from the market for the bad rep is giving them."
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased this router with the Netgear WG511T wireless card. I must admit the setup was very straight forward. I did need to configure the router and card 2x to get the 108 Mbps. Maybe it was something I did or didn't do correctly the first time (channel 6)?Anyway, the range is fantastic and so far I have not experienced any loss in connection. The only reason for the 4 stars rather than 5 is that it does not work with my Motorla Analog Telephone Adapter (Vonage VoIP). I must first connect the ethernet cable from my modem to the ATA then to the router.The unit is very slim and is unobtrusive. It comes with a stand so that it can be set vertically rather than horizontally.Hope this helps."
3,not out of the box hookup,"I did eventually get this thing working, but it took all day and lots of fussing, checking, and double checking to get even simple security settings to work. As well the manual could use some more technical details and cross referencing. In the end cannot be sure where the problem was, as the settings on my Dell TrueMobile 1150 wireless card are slightly different than those on the router. Initially I did have lots of signal drops but then that 'magically' stopped as well. Go figure.But still, renewing the IP in the router software settings causes a connection loss that is only solved by flashing both the router and cable modem - could be either device in that case. I am happy with it overall - but I would probably buy a 802.11b/g only if I were to buy one (this one was a gift). It is my understanding that you need the corresponding proprietary netgear card to get the 108Mbps speeds."
4,"Overall, fine product as advertized.","Overall, this product has a better wireless range than my old wireless router. The only problem that I have is that it hang up quite often like once every other day. I downloaded the latest firmware 3.0.2 but it does not help. I have to push the little button at the back of the box to reset the box, then connect to the box using wired (wireless does not work all the time) connection, then the wireless connection works. I also have problem with the tech support's English. If someone knows a version of the firmware provides more stable connection, please post a message.Thank you."
1,Too slow to deal with,"The so-called easy setup wasn't particularly easy. I had many issues trying to get an internet connection, setup continued to fail for about 10 times. After going through the steps on the 11th time we managed to get setup to complete successfully (using DHCP). After setup I needed to reboot the computer to get my connection back.The very big issue was the speed degradation over my wired connection. It's like the bad ole days of dialup. It's going back to the store."
1,TERRIBLE...DO NOT BUY IT... 3 ROUTER & NO SOLUTION,"I have gone through 3 same routers. All the same reason...router being rebooted very very frequently. FYI, I also have the matching 108Mbps card to go with it. I have given it enough chances that it had to be refunded finally. Tech support of ok but after making me try different things, all three times they told me the unit is defective and should get a replacement.I would definitely NOT recommend this product at all...!!!You will lose lots of time and left with frustration and anger..."
1,UPDATE: It gets worse,"After countless hours of trying to make this useless product work, Netgear offered to replace it - if I gave them my credit card number, which they claimed would not be charged unless I failed to send back the defective router. Given the gross incompetence of their customer service, I'd rather eat the loss than risk them having my CC number on file. Their attitude was extremely condescending - like they were doing me a great favor by waving the shipping charges for the replacement. Speaking to a supervisor didn't help either - she had an even snootier attitude than the rep. Do yourself a favor - if after all this you still buy a Netgear product, and it doesn't work, bring it back for a refund immediately - trying to get these Netgear idiots to understand customer service or support is like trying to get good sushi at Mcdonalds - impossible. I paid dearly for trying to make the router work, instead of just getting a refund while I could. Don't make the same mistake."
1,Lies Lies Lies,"Forget 108 !! After 3 calls to India, I'm still dealing with speeds closer to 24-36 mbps. I was told that ""108"" ""is not really generally attainable."" That's a fact!!!AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
1,Faulty wireless connectivity,"Bottom-line this is the worst wireless router I have ever used.The DHCP is extremely unreliable. If you try to set up a secure wireless network, the DHCP does not even work. In order for it to function, even partially, the wireless network has to be completely open and unsecure. Even then it will only work for anywhere between 30 minutes and one hour. Afterwards you have to unplug the router and plug it back in to get it going again.I'm not sure if I simply purchased a bad router, but I'm not the only one that has complained about this. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on something that may or may not work."
2,This unit is for SUCK!,"So far I have had nothing but trouble with this router. It will randomly drop the PPPoE connection. You can go to many different web pages & then all of sudden, it will time out. Connection gets dropped & you have to try & reconnect. Most of the time this does not work & you will have to unplug the unit for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Once powered back up, sometimes it will reconnect on it's own but most of the time you have to make it connect manually by logging in through web interface. Netgear Tech Support is useless & the forums just have a bunch of worthless posts from kids that cant download their pron through a BitTorrent client because they can't figure out port forwarding.I always had good luck with Netgear in the past, but I am done after this unit. I am going back to a reputable company, Zyxel."
1,Waste of money,I am tired of endless rebooting.I have only one wish: to get rid of this junk asfast as possible.
1,GARBAGE - Drops Connections,"This router is nothing but trouble. I'm trying to use it for VPN connections. DROPS THEM. Also drops connections to any other computer every 5 minutes or so. Did site survey, nothing else here to cause this. Also, no other phones, or other appliances to cause interference. This router just flat out [stinks]. [...]"
5,"Up and running, no problems!","Contrary to some reviewers I had absolutely no trouble connecting WGT624 Router to my Motorola Cable Modem and Mac G5. It was as simple as following the 5 easy steps laid out in the instruction manual. Had it up and running in less than 20 minutes. Have not have a problem in the 2 months I have been using it. Use it nightly, both on the T1 ports and the wireless capability. Often use both at the same time and find no bondwidth issues."
1,A once outstanding company now with horrible quality,"In the past I have been a strong proponent of Netgear's products.They were always one of the most innovative wireless router companies. Howver, they seem to be yet another company who's quality has been destroyed by outsourcing.I bought this modem for its new security features, but it lasted only 5 or 6 months before it failed. I believe it failed after I updated the bios with the built-in upgrade wizard. It now is not able to establish an IP connection with my cable modem.I tried installing an old version of the router bios, but this has not helped. I know the configuration settings are correct - I tried every combination that should work.Netgear customer support will not honor their warranty because they claim upgrading to their new bios is a ""configuration"" problem, not a hardware problem."
2,Avoid this router....,"..unless you have 5 minutes to spare waiting for your gmail page to open up.The setup time for this router was annoyingly long in comparison to other wireless networks I have set up for friends and family, but I endured the process in the hopes that the 108Mbps would ""push"" signal a bit harder in my concrete condo (although I knew going in that my network card was only 54Mbps).What I've found is that my network speed is dwarfed by all of the other networks I have set up when I link to them. I can even be in the same room as my netgear router and the speed does not improve. My machine isn't the problem, my spatial relationship to the router isn't the problem...that only leaves one item left as the culprit.My office and several of my friends run off Linksys routers (a Microsoft friend said that all the techy's at MS recommend Linksys routers) and they work great.I'm ordering my Linksys right now."
1,"Don't buy it , I tried 2 models and none worked !!!","This router is really fast when it works. Unfortunately, it constantly reboots, even after upgrading to the newest firmware. First, I thought it was defective so I returned it for a replacement. The second one had exactly the same problem. Neatgear has to work this out and release a new firmware upgrade."
2,Good for basic use only,"This device worked well as long as I kept all the default settings, which is the way most home users will use it. However once I customized the router settings to interoperate with my in-home LAN, it became extremely unreliable. It would drop connections and refuse to re-establish them until the router was restarted, it would refuse remote management, and it would sometimes mysteriously alter its own settings. I used to rely on Netgear as a safe brand to purchase and rely on, but sadly the last two products I've bought from them have turned out to be throw-aways."
4,Netgear WGT624 Super G 108 Mbps Wireless Router,"It is a 54Mbps router and not a 108Mbps Router, But it works fine I am happy with it"
1,Worst Wireless Router Ever!,"This is the worst router I have ever seen. I recieved it as a christmas gift so I could wireless broadban over the internet. I replaced our D-Link router with this one, and immediately my roomates and I noticed a significant drop in performance. Websites would take minutes(!) to load, instead of fractions of seconds, and this was through a wire. The wireless internet was even slower. Please do not buy this garbage and instead purchase a D-Link or Linksys router instead. You save time and money."
1,"Horrid, Heinous, Happy to return","This product is such a piece of junk I feel compelled to write a review. It took hours to set up (and I've been a professional computer programmer for 6 years). Tech support has you try the same things - over and over and over again. After a while I said ""screw it"" and got it working myself. Then it stops working one day. No reason, no changes. Do you really want to put yourself through this?Is there anything lower than 1 star?"
5,"Works just as it should, most of the time.","The router I received works great, however there is a problem that I am not sure is related to the router itself. Although rare, I sometimes find myself disconnected from the internet. I do not think it is the router's fault for my parents have the exact same one and it works fine. I think it is do to my campus internet interacting with it. Beyond all of that, the products works great and is exactly how you described it."
1,Repeatedly Drops Signal,"Setup went smoothly but this router's performance was subpar. It regularly dropped the signal, requiring me to routinely reboot my computer. My rating reflects that fact that the replacement purchased is far superior...no dropped signal, even after starting up from the sleep mode.I read several negative reviews posted, but since there were a few positive ones, I made this risky purchase. In the end, it didn't pay off; I do NOT recommend this router, not even for less than $20. It doesn't work consistently!"
4,Great router with some hiccups,This is a nice router and runs well. I gave it 4 stars as it drops the connection once in a while and reconnects in a couple seconds. You won't really notice this unless you are downloading something.The setup was very easy. Didn't really needed the manual. Just connect the LAN cable and you get connected immediately. Go to http://192.168.1.1 to setup wireless connection and other settings. The web interface is nice and easy to use. Would recommend it!!!
1,Frustrating,"My experience: frustrating consumer support...difficult access and slowness of the support website and once you get through lack of responsiveness, unexpected connection breaks.. I am very sorry I bought it.Suggestion: Maybe the company should outsource their support site to the USA."
2,I won't provide the details---,"I won't provide the details since there are numerous entries already describing the same problems I have encountered. I will just put my rating and add one more to the list that says this product isn't worth the cost. It has given me more hassle and is slower than all the Linksys, and Dlink wireless/routers/switches I have used before."
1,self rebooting without a reason,"GoodI just ordered it from Amazon this week and I received it in 3 days with free shipping. Thanks Amazon.BadIt has self rebooting problem from day one (model WGT624 v2 with newest firmware). Technical support suggested me to reset the router and when that did not work out, they suggested me to return it and try some other models. Is this their best shot to support its customers? Netgear should not ship this product out. They should have a recall and a fix for all its customers."
1,Unbelievably bad product.,"If there was a 0 star(s) option, I would have chosen it.This router accepts both hard-wired and wireless connections, however after connecting it, my hard-wired connection speed dropped by 40%. I stuck it out for a few days hoping it would get better, or that it was some glitch, but finally I unplugged it and reverted to my previous router (also Netgear), and the speed returned.I would expect a slowdown with wireless vs wired, but I would not expect such a degradation of throughput with my wired connections.[...]"
1,Scottish and Irish Folk the German way,"Fiddler's Green call their music ""speed folk"", and on this 2-CD-live-album you get more than two hours of it (there even is an edition with a third bonus CD). Although I never saw the band live, I really do believe that they - and probably most of the audience - are having a good time. If you listen to the CD alone without the concert experience, it's about the same as if a cajun band or Scottish folk band tried to perform German folk music - it just isn't the real thing. If you're looking for authentic speed folk you probably do better with the Pogues."
2,Not Efficient!,"I'm not sure but when I snapped this in my typewriter, I was thinking it was going to work. Boy did was I in for a rude awakening. It doesn't erase all the mistake. I tried it like three times to erase my error but no such happening."
5,Ribbons,This correction tape is jusxt exactly what I needed. Will purchase from you again in the future.
4,The Most Underated Expansion Pack,"Although Livin' Large is not my favorite expansion pack, I think it is the most underated. What would we do without the telescope, chemistry set and guitar? I loved all the wacky items that Maxis added and the medieval theme. If you have the sims deluxe edition don't worry about buying it... Livin' Large is included."
3,Not as much as I expected,"The added neighborhoods were cool, but they don't interact.I've run out of ""oomph"" on this game and lost interest."
4,They did it again,I wrote a review for the original sims game. I only give this sims game a 4 because there isn't really anything different in it except a few different homes and items. I think that this is a good game to add to your collection and its much more entertaining. But it just doesn't have that same effect that the original game did. *Note you cannot download this game without the original sims game* This game is still really fun but I suggest that you stick with the original game instead. Its much more entertaining
4,"MORE STUFF,OH YEAH!!","A great livin'large expension pack for your original Sims,now this livin'large have alots of stuff for us to build different houses,decorected the sims home with more wallpaper and floor cover that I can choose from.Also the furniture,more furniture I would say.What I like about this expansion pack,that I can build 5 new houses on a same land then I can watched them and play them,This is a great!"
5,Livin' Large and Livin' Super,I love The Sims Livin' Large. It is not like any other computer game.I love how you can make up the furninture in each room.The people are so cool to make and dress.I hope the Sims House Party is even better. Good Bye Sim Fans Love YA!!!!
5,Great,I have the sims game also & love these games. I cant wait for house party the add on to this game that is comes out at the end of this month. I spend hours playing & downloading things for my sims off the many websites.There is a nice size book in the sims that will really help you out. But remember this is an add on you do need the sim first to play living large. I would say buy both game
5,Rocks,this game rocks I hesitated to buy it at first because it didn't sound as realistic but it is great. i would advise everyone to buy it
5,Ehhh... it's ok,"Actually this is a great installment, but my favorite is House Party. What's great about Livin' Large is mostly the items. New items include a robot, love bed, and a lot more. Like all the other expansion packs this one more neighborhoods. I would suggest you just wait for Sims 2 to come out instead of buying more expansion packs."
1,Read this before you buy!,There is a problem with the CD not working on alot of CD drives. You should check on the Sims website to make sure you don't have one of those drives.
4,Yahoo more room more fun!,"My son got this for Christmas and thank God he's on break from school, because I know he would be falling asleep in class. He stays up every night playing it and now has gotten me into it. We have so much fun trying to help each other get to work on time and get better at the game and give each other hints a long the way. He even designed his house to look like ours and then started showing me things to put in the backyard. Thanks sims now I have to take out a second mortgage. :)"
2,Nothing new.,"This expansion was a disappointment. All it really did was add a few items, nothing more nothing less. Its fun for about 10 days then its pretty boring after that, incredibly repetitious and doesn't add much. Now maybe if there was a value pack that had both Living Large and House party then that would be different, or if House Party and Living Large were combined into one game. That would add a lot more."
4,"""Living Large"" is pretty good","I would have to say first of all this game is probably worth your money. It adds so much to the game it will add hours of game play. Most of the new objects tend to hurt your sims more than they help, well, atleast the fun ones. If you haven't bought ""The Sims"" yet and are considering buying it and the expansion pack wait until they combine them in a ""The Sims Gold"" or something. It isn't worth seventy dollars to buy them induvidually. All in all if you like playing the sims, but are getting a little bored, then by all means buy this game."
1,It didn't work at all...not even on a brand-new computer,"When I first played The Sims, I thought it a wonderful game. I was in love with it. So when I received the expansion pack, I was ecstatic!However, once I installed it, (which was a long process in itself and it also gave an error message) the game would not work. I would start the game, on my brand-new computer, and the game would blank out my screen, then return me to my desktop. I tried over and over, but it was useless.I then had another problem...the riduculous people at Maxis made it so that in order to uninstall The Sims Livin' Large, you need to uninstall The Sims. This caused me to have to make backups of all my files, then have to reinstall The Sims and put my backups in the game.All in all, though the game is fun, (I've played it at friend's houses) it is not worth the trouble. Stick to the original."
4,Cool,"I love the Sims I have played the Sims for hours at a time. You can create people, name them, Feed them, make them sleep,make them take a shower,learn and many other things. I would recomend buying both The Sims and then getting the extention pack and then you can go on the internet and download stuff. With the Sims extension pack you can make the sims do any thing from playing pool to falling in love. I would have rated this game a five star but after about 6 months it gets a little. But all in all I would buy this game."
5,A Must-Have if You&#65533;re a Fan of The Sims,"If you're a fan of The Sims - the finest and most enjoyable example of a time-waster I've ever run across - you'll want the Livin' Large expansion pack. It adds a lot of humor and variety to the game. The chemistry set and the work bench are especially useful, and the crystal ball can be used to improve your Sims personality, if you follow the hints it gives. Some of the additions are tasteful and some tacky, and some just for fun. Watch out for the Vibromatic bed, my Sims wound up with a baby and I have no idea how that happened. Er...that baby definitely wasn't planned, not by me anyway, I mean. Like every other fan I can think of a zillion things I'd like to see added to the game, and as well I agree there are some irritating aspects I'd like to see removed, so I hope Maxis comes out with more expansion packs in the future, and I'm hoping it'll be before my interest in the game wanes. We'll all just buy bigger and faster computers, right?"
5,Even better than the original,"I didn't think that the Sims could ever be improved. But when I got this I realized how wrong I was. There's new jobs, outfits, and things to buy. You can even plead with the Grim Reaper to let one of your dieing sims live. This game is fantastic and I would recommend this game to everyone."
2,"Okay, but Kinda Weird...","There are some things that I liked about this expansion pack, and then there are many things that I did not care for. I DID like being able to have the new jobs, more lots, and some of the objects. The things I did NOT like are the weird objects, wallpaper, floors, and the list goes on. I actualy ended up selling this expansion pack to one of my friends, and he kinda likes it. If you want an awsome expansion pack, then you should get House Party. House Party has some things from Livin' Large that I liked, such as the the jobs and lots. I think that Livin' Large is an expansion pack for the Sim player that likes to make weird families, but if you want normal families like I do get House Party."
2,ouch,I have all the sims games so far(including hot date) and this one hit an alltime low. many people thought that this game was better than house party but what they did not consider is the truth. This game was deffinitly better than house party if it had WORKED!!! This game made lots of problems for many people. My version did not even work until house party was instaled. this is the only expantion pack that caused so many problems for people. So if you really want to buy this game make sure that you keep the box and every thing because you have a 50-50 chance of this game not working
4,"Love it, but ...",... after a while I get bored with it and start hunting the net for more Sim stuff.
5,Addiction 101,"As if The Sims by itself wasn't addictive enough. Maxis and Electronic Arts have developed what every Sim player has been waiting for... an expansion pack called wLivin' Large. And with 125 new items, 50 new jobs and five times the houses, why shouldn't it be called that? The expansion pack adds a certain livelyhood and chance game that wasn't included in the original game - potions that can turn you into a monster or make you invisible, killer guinea pigs, an out of practice genie, a crystal ball, and a vibromatic love bed (what would a sim's bedroom be without one?). More choices and more obstacles provide you... the gameplayer... with even more possibilities than ever before as well as hour after hour of addictive purple genie fun. Just be careful... that genie just might set your love bed ablaze."
4,Good game,"This game was a very fun game.For begginers all you have to do is make your people in a good mood.But what I really like about it,is that it's like you are controlling your own life.It is a great game.It is funny how they get married and how they have a baby.In the bed they just appear as a big lump,and in the hot tub they just go down.When the kid pops up this little colered blocks come up.But all I have to say is this game is very fun.You should buy it right away.It took me fore ever to get this game and all the rest.And let me tell you it was worth the wait!"
4,good but not great,"Livin' Large was good if you were looking for themes and decorating ideas.Advancing game play, not so much. However, if you don't mind cheats, there are sites well worth your while."
2,only for Windows 95/98,"I am extremeley disappointed with this game because it will NOT run on Windows 2000 or higher. If you have Windows 95/98, this looks like it could be a really great game. I was really looking forward to playing it. But I spent 2 weeks dealing with techsupport at Electronic Arts and Microsoft, and can't get it to run. I wish EA would stop making their games only compatible with Win 95/98. They said it MIGHT run on XP, but I'm not about to go buy it just to play a game. Don't get any of the other expansion packs either if you have windows 2000, apparently NONE of them are compatible."
3,Ok game.,"When I first bought this game I was expecting much more than what it was. It is pretty much the same as the regulare sims game. The only thing different in it is that there are 5 new neighborhoods ( which all look the same), there are new objects but not many ( only about 25 or so), and there are new skins ( but not many). Over all I do like it (but dont love it). I would not spend [money] on it, I would find a used copy of it."
3,ok,"This is the first sequel that Maxis made to The Sims, and it is an ok addon, but it's nothing to rave about. First, you don't get many new things. An item here or there, and four new jobs, but other than that nothing. So it's really only a mediocre addon."
3,Good..but not great.,"Like a lot of people, I excitedly bought the extension pack soon after it was available in stores. Already addicted to the game, I was eager to provide my sims with more challenges and expand the game. Although the extention pack did add more new elements to the game(over 125 new items to purchase, new characters such as a genie, new career paths, 4 additional neighborhoods, and new skins, I felt like they should have offered more considering the extention pack cost almost as much as the game itself. Is it worth it? Yes, but I still feel more could have been included to make the product better."
1,Livin'Large,Can not download due to no serial number was on the cd-rom case.Unable to find contact to see how to get one.............
5,SIMS:The Superb Computer Game,"The Sims brought me many hours of joy on my computer.At first i wasn't sure if I would like it but as soon as I started to play when someone tryed to talk to me all i would say is ""Yeah whatever"".The Sims rocked and whoever dosn't like it should be put in an asylum! When the new one comes you'll be sure i'm first on line!-The Sims Master Alexander"
4,Sim Heaven,"Everyone knows the sims, the adorable characters roam the virtual house as they go about their pointless lives. The original was an extraordinary game which broke all expectations. What could be added to this masterpiece ? More....The highlight of the extension pack has to be the vibrater bed, which allows your sims to 'play in bed.' This and other cool updates like : electric guitars, magic lamps, new costumes and five new careers, make the original game a thousand times better. If you've got bored of the sims or just want a change, then this is the perfect add-on."
2,Not all that,"The only great thing in the expansion pack is that you have more neighborhoods to work with, which means you can make more houses. (But beware-- you can't call Sims in different neighborhoods). Apart from that, there are some new objects, but most of them are ugly or lame. I say don't waste your money. Oh and the expansion pack puts disgusting roaches in your house TOO OFTEN. I hate having to spray the roach infestation every 5 minutes."
5,If you have an awesome cheat code for the Sims....beware!,"Love the add-on but was taken aback when I could no longer use my awesome cheat codes to obtain more financial support for my Sims, etc. I truly enjoy the new characters, Sim skins, etc. I also noticed that some of the employment opportunties earned less money than in the original Sims game. I am disappointed that the Sims never seem to get a day off and also have cockroaches showing up, even in the cleanest houses. Definitely purchase this, if you don't mind not being able to use the cheat codes for the original game. Sooner or later, they'll come out with new ones."
1,see no. 3,"I wish I could review it but I could not even get started. First, I want to get a copy of this video but don't have the slightest idea what songs and how many songs there are. Is there a way to have the track listing available?Thanks."
1,Thanks!,I just wanted to thank E. Bradfield for ruining the plot of this book by revealing what happens at the end.
1,Too Weird for Words,"Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people. I am not one of them. Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction. I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche. If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed."
5,Belter,"Any book involving atomic theories, bicycles, council conspiricies and very small boxes has got to be worth a look. Confusing, hilarious and, despite appearances to the contrary, a plot. Published posthumously, I think - O'Brien was clearly fond of it as large portions appear in The Dalkey Archive. But if you've read that, don't let it put you off, The Third Policeman is better. Damn fine read, heartily recommended (reviewers are required to say this by law I believe)."
2,Too Weird for My Taste,"Too bizare for my taste and way out of my literary league. However, if you want a taste of what hell could be like, go for it."
2,On par with Alice,"A nonsensical tale, somewhat resembling Alice In Wonderland in ridiculousness by verging on insanity. For the 1940's it was well ahead of its time, and unpublished for 27 years because of this. Not recommended for those expecting an easy read."
5,Don't Read the Intro until AFTER the Novel,I read the intro after i finished the book and i'm so thankful i did because there's a major plot spoiler in it! excellent book by the way...
5,truly surreal and mind-warping,"a must-read for anyone who believes that surrealism is an important mode of communication. this is a cornerstone surrealist work. read it, and also read ""at swim-two-birds"" -- another, slightly more humorous and easier-to-identify-with book."
5,The joy of our Flann,"Undoubtedly one of the finest books I have ever read, a sentiment echoed by the several people I distributed the book to after reading it myself. After a relatively straightforward opening chapter the plot just takes off, leaving you asking yourself what the hell is going on. The atomic theory, DeSelby, bicycles - it's hard to believe this book is a product of pre-war Ireland. And it ends well too. A book that you will want to tell your friends about in the pub. By the way, the Poor Mouth is great too, although it's aimed much more directly at an Irish audience."
3,Denis Donoghue should be tarred and feathered!,WARNING! A man with half a brain wrote the intro to this book.What kind of critic GIVES AWAY THE ENTIRE PLOT in the forward!This idiot is not qualified to write the intro to a BBQ cookbook!
2,(shrugs indifferently),"I'd never read anything from this author before and doubt that I will again. For what it's worth, the author has a real knack for painting a picture, but absurdist fiction is just not my cup of tea."
5,A MUST READ FOR NON BELIEVERS OF HUMOR IN HADES,I WASN'T SURE ABOUT WHAT I WAS READING UNTIL I GOT A WAYS INTO THE PAPERBACK VERSION. A BOOK YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT DOWN. I LOVE TO READ AND THIS IS A [FIRST] FOR ME TO HAVE EVER READ ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I LOVED IT!!!!
3,"Once you pick it up, you might as well stick with it until the bitter end.","This is an interesting literary experiment. The book itself is rather horrible to read, until you get to the end. Once you read the end, the story is a lot more interesting. However, reading the other 90% of the book could be desribed as a mindnumbing and somewhat painful experience. The end redeems some of the effort you have put into it, but I still walked away from this book feeling apathy towards it. Perhaps the reward wasn't sweet enough to justify the bitter pill of slogging through the endless passages on bicycles and omnium. And despite the wonderfully clever idea, the ending doesn't come as that much of a surprise. While reading this, I was really reminded of how the mind feels when you are delerious with fever. Which was, I am sure, the intended effect. But still, it's unpleasant to have a fever. You feel awful and you can't wait until it's gone. Which is kind of how I feel about this book."
5,Where horror and great comedy meet,"There are answers in this book for most questions that were ever asked, and ever will be. The horror of history repeating itself for ever and ever and ever is only topped by the horror of not knowing what terrible mishap, regulation, law of physics, or self-fulfilling prophecy is presented to the amazed reader after the turn of the next page.I started reading Flann O'Brian with this one, and then worked my way through At Swim-Two-Birds, and it is obvious that At Swim-Two-Birds is the better book, but The Third Policeman is the funnier one."
5,This is the one,"Yo,Can I say sumthin about Tech N9ne (...) A Sway & Tech Rapper with a flavor for the mic and more talent then most of these better known rappers(Jay-Z). He wrote this song Psycho B*tch the best song i've ever heard on the subject of girls and the messages as well as the beat which is amazing. His freestyles not on this album are good comparisons to his massive talent.Yup,O.T.R."
2,This Album is Garbage,"I purchased this record to support my Kansas City rappers but this record is garbage. Tech's got skills, but he is not displaying his talents. Homeboy needs something else to rap about, besides that devil stuff is weak."
2,whut tha hell is this? goth rap?,"hmmmm....whut to say about this new Tech 9 album, lemme first off by saying this. Tech is an extremely good mc...i've heard him on various hip hop shows freestyling and displayig whut he's made of....and i was impressed with whut i heard...but none tha less this cd is garbage....avoid it at all costs...unless your into gothic type idealisms.....if you want to hear some shocking stuff....i reccomend Dr. Octagon or tha old gravediggaz album"
1,tech-9 is hella wack,"Im not going to say much but tech is wack. His lyrics don't make any sence and sound like a bunch of jibber jabber. His ideas are wack. His lyrics make about as much sence as the name of this album. In my opinion he is not proffesional quality. He's been rapping along time, 10yrs and needs to give up and get a day job somewhere. That's the truth! but to make a long story short, hes got a lot of people messed up listen to his wierd nonsence rapping, for instance trying to rap a whole song backwards(like people are going to sit back and try to flip all his words around and figure out what he saying). I dont' know how to characterize his rap because I don't think it has a place in the game. If U want to Here real MIDWEST rappers from K.C look up RICH DA FACTOR and BIG HAM. CAN I JUST GIVE HIM 0 STARS?"
4,Great album.,"This is my first Tech N9ne album so far. Some ofthe songs are ok, but the one called ""Breathe"" is my favorite one of all! And I will get another Tech N9ne album later."
5,You want TRUE rap? Here it is,"T9 is the FIRST rapper I have heard lately that doesnt have the ""oh im gonna go kill some cops and then beat on every girl i see."" You want rappin to a beat...he's got it. you want bullet-rap... he's got it. Tech has everything and more. If you anit listenin to T9, you anit ALIVE.KCMO BABY"
2,What a shame...,"What a shame. This sounds like it could have been a pretty good album. The production quality is horrible. It sounds like they are singing from inside a coffee can, inside a phone booth. The songs sound like they would be okay if the quality of the recording was better. I have other stuff that is much older than this album that has stellar production quality and A-1 sound quality, so I don't know what the problem was. Before this was released, they should have listened to it and then fired their technician and then redone the whole thing from scratch. I was very disappointed with this. I could not even stand to listen to it, it actually hurt my ears. I felt sorry for the band, that this was what their creation was turned into."
5,Works perfectly,"As with most Command hooks I've used these were very easy to ""install"" and very dependable.I've had these on the back of the bathroom door to hold towels and they are fantastic. The hook is deep enough to hold bath towels. They are extremely sturdy too.I love that they can be easily removed without damaging the surface."
4,Entirely functional,"I struggled a little bit to get this to release the way that it is suppose to without having to peel off the adhesive, but once I figured it out, I was able to successfully relocate the hook.Awesome use for apartment dwellers when things can't be hammered into the wall!"
5,Easy to mount,"Easy to mount and surprisingly strong. I stuck these to my kitchen door to hold a dog's leash, harness, and towel. They work well and I like that the sticky stuff doesn't ruin the surface it's mounted to when removed. I'll be ordering a few more of these."
5,Really works!,"I was doubtful, and I was wrong. These do hold strongly, haven't ripped paint off the walls, and are actually fairly attractive. Definitely a useful product!"
5,best hook-up ever,"These little hooks hold a lot of weight with no hammering or harsh screws to hurt your fingers. I put one up in my closet and the plastic hook is much easier on my robe and nightgown than the metal hook that was originally there. I love that I can put it anywhere without having to search for a stud. It really holds a lot of weight with ease. I highly recommend them. They are well worth the money and because they come off so easily without harm to your wall or door, you can put them anywhere. Plenty of strength to hang a pot, but delicate enough to use as a decorative hook to hang a wreath."
5,Excellent for hanging poster,"Used for hanging framed poster:I received these hooks and decided to use them to hang a framed poster up. The poster is about 38 inches long and 27 inches wide. I used both hooks just to be safe, followed the directions on the package and hung the picture. The picture looks great it's exactly where I wanted it and how I wanted it. These hooks were perfect for this quick and easy job. The poster also had a wire cord going across the back for hanging. That made my job for hooking a whole lot easy. I can say that if you are hanging a poster then these are perfect, for anything else I am not the review to read."
5,Great handy easy to use wall hooks,"Great simple to attach, and no messy ripped holes in the walls or doors when you decide you need to remove them. Two hooks come in a pack, very reasonably priced. Easy stick on, just clean the area with alcohol, let it dry, then press the adhesive strip onto the back of the hook, then remove the paper cover over the adhesive, then press the hook onto the area chosen, and then pull up the hook against the surface, and then back down again, and it's done, you can use it in one hour's time. Removal is simple, just pull up the hook against the surface, and slowly pull the adhesive down until it all comes off, no sticky residue or ugly marks on the wall. Nice.Highly recommended."
4,Surprisingly strong hooks,"Probably the most important thing to note about these hooks is how to remove them the correct way, if you need to take them down. Don't just grab and pull towards you! The 3M adhesives are always good and strong, and in this case you can peel your drywall surface off if you don't follow the directions carefully. Instead, to remove the hook you need to stretch the material straight down parallel to the wall for many inches. This seems counter-intuitive, but the 3M engineers know what they're talking about. The instructions in the packaging show the right way to do this, and I'd suggest safely archiving this information away when you first put the hooks up. They work well, holding something like 3 pounds of weight. We didn't try installing without first washing the wall with alcohol, mostly because the 3M people do know what they're talking about and we trust their instructions. Basically, they work very well when you follow all the directions."
5,Great Product- but don't overload it,"This is my fourth set of these hooks and they are great. I use them in places that I don't want to drill holes. I put two hooks in my kitchen on the wood cabinets to hold my kids backpacks. They lasted about 2 yrs until my child's backpack got to heavy. The interesting thing is that the actual curved part of the hook is the part that broke. It did not rip the back off or damage the wood in any way. They seem to work well on painted surfaces as well and the wall does not have to be perfectly flat, it can be textured. This product is well worth the price but pay attention to what size you get so that it can hold your items without breaking."
4,Very useful,"These things are great for hanging light things around your rented apartment where you want your security deposit back. Only problem I had was when I put one of these on the door in my bedroom where I used a humidifier. It kept falling off the door. But it worked fine on the wall, humidity and all."
4,Simple and effective,"For a impermanant solution thes work fine, not fancy or all that decorative but good for hanging just about anything within the weight allowance.I use them on my inside closet door for purses and lightweight jackets. And with an extra set of tape you can move it again before needing to buy more of their special tape."
3,Time Will Tell But So Far Ok,"I have used other sticking strips brands b4 and frankly they have not lived up to their promises of holding strongly. I use these strips mostly in the kitchen for hanging utensils and/or cartridges that contain them. After first using them the cartridge and hangers fell to the ground. I put them back up and then they fell again. Only after using some MASTER SUPER GLUE in addition to the strip did they manage to stay up, but if thats the case then I could have just gotten some single strips from the local hardware store. Im sure the glue when removed will remove some paint, but in our case it doesnt matter since we are in need of paint job soon . I'd say try it if you find nothing else, but just be forewarned it may not work."
5,GREAT CHOICE,"These hooks are simple yet effective. These hooks come off easily, rarely leaving any sticky residue. They are discrete and strong enough to hold, at the least, a winter jacket. This is the perfect tool for a college student looking to hang up their clothes and not damage their walls.I will absolutely buy again and again."
3,Hanging In There...,"My mom uses them and loves them although she ripped some paint off the wall when she didn't follow the instructions for removal. I'm not a fan of the cheap looking plastic used with these. I'd like to see them use a high quality plastic with a little more shine to them so they match the rest of the white plastic items such as my wall outlets and light switch covers. Installation seems to have too many steps then it really should. In the end, I do recommend this product especially for people that don't want to put more holes in the wall.UPDATE: Over a year later and this is still hanging strong on the bathroom door. Nice!"
4,Pretty strong for temporary hooks!,"I hung these hooks on the side of one of our press board shelves for added storage. They stick easily and come with 2 sets of stickies so that you can put them somewhere else if you change your mind. They hold about 4-6 pounds easily and stick well. They come off mostly clean-not as cleanly as advertised-they did leave a slight stickiness on the shelf, but it was easily wiped off with a damp rag. Overall, if you're renting a house and don't want to leave marks on the wall, these are a GREAT product for you!! I've also seen them advertised for holiday decorations and can definitely say I'll be adding these to my list of Christmas Decor ""must haves""!"
4,Works great for towel and robe hooks on doors,"I tried these on some old wooden doors in my bedroom. We have always screwed in metal hooks, but they pull out eventually, leaving ugly screw holes in the door. These adhered well when I applied them and are holding towels and robes nicely on our door. If they ever do fall off, they won't leave ugly holes in the door.Be sure to follow the installation instructions, including the one hour wait before hanging anything on them. Also, follow the weight guidelines. I decided not to use it as a purse hook, since my purse is over 3 lbs.Great product and I plan to buy more for other bedroom doors!"
1,Boy are these ugly,"Designer ? No way. Don't plan on using them anyplace where you have to look at them! They appear cheap and flimsy (although they aren't actually cheap) and they are not as useful as the word ""medium"" implies - think a hat or a washcloth, rather than a purse, and definitely not a wet bathtowel. Note that the product does not list a weight limit - probably because the company is afraid to admit how little these hooks can bear."
4,Ease to apply,"Need a hook in the middle of a wall but don't want to put a nail there? Then use 3M's Designer Hooks. They are easy to apply to clean surfaces - simply peal the red side of the double sided tape and apply to the back of the hook. Then peel the black side and press the hook onto the surface.Simple! Oh, you are wondering about removal. That's easy too. Remove the hook by sliding it up. The fastener is still there. You just stretch the tab about a foot down and it's off!"
3,"Useful for closet, garage storage","These small, adhesive hooks are sturdier than they look -- but they don't look very attractive, so what usefulness you get out of them will likely be in out of the way places like closets, pantries, and garages.They're made to adhere to walls, and boy do they ever stick. No surprise there, considering they're made by 3M, which is synonymous with 'make stuff stick to other stuff.' You just have to give them time to fully adhere to your chosen surface. Once they're on, they're ON.The hooks themselves, though, are rather small, limiting their usefulness. You won't be hanging bags with very broad/thick straps on them, for instance. Fine for trinkets, clothing, and smaller items -- they'd be great for an outdoor shower or in the shed -- but they're not quite the all-purpose storage solution you might hope.Overall a very solid product provided you have a specific use in mind for them."
5,Versitile,"I have so many of these because they are so useful! Mainly, I use them as hooks for coats and jackets. Each of them could hold at least two heavy winter coats without a problem.The only thing I am cautious about is when I want to remove it from the wall after years of having it on the wall, as the adhesive could lose some elasticity. Therefore, when you pull the strip downward, it needs to be very slow and gentle, and it needs to be straight/downward. I've broken the strip a few times in the past, and it was a pain to remove the rest, or it could actually lift the wall paint during the removal process."
4,Perform as advertised,"With this product from 3M Corp, it performs as advertised. It is easy to remove and is able to hold strongly."
4,"Easy installation, limited strength","I put one of these hooks up in the guestbath intending for it to hold a bathrobe. It wasn't quite strong enough to hold a traditional adult size terrycloth robe - within a couple of minutes the entire hook just sort of slipped off the door and to the floor. GRRRRR...... So I put the second one up in the kitchen where it's currently holding 3 lightweight pot holders. The directions say to clean the area for the hook with rubbing alcohol and I imagine there is a specific reason for this, but if you don't have any alcohol handy, Purell will work as well. The package also states that each hook will hold up to 3lbs and I feel certain that probably wishful thinking. I will say this though - the second one in the kitchen has stayed up for several days now with no failure."
4,3M Hanger,"There is no question that when it comes to down to hangers and accessories for the home, 3M knows how to help you with your everyday needs from tape, to hooks. That works well with these Command designer hooks. They definitely work very well and remain strong with anything that you hang on the wall from a picture or portrait, to a carbon monoxide alarm. It really holds very strong not only for its price, but sincerely for the everyday projects and trinkets that help you call your house home. I really recommend these 3M Command Designer Hooks as a great buy for those little things you need to hang anything up in your home that needs a lift up.Price: BControl & Convience: B+Overall: B 1/2+"
3,"Okay,but needs work","I got these because as a renter I am always looking for ways to customize my apartment without making my landlord unhappy. So the opportunity to have a few more hanging hooks without damaging the walls was appealing to me. Unfortunately, while the adhesive does indeed remove without leaving a mark, one of the two hooks couldn't hold more than a single shirt without falling off, and that was actually the one I did a better job of installing. So it needs some improvement, but the basic concept is good."
4,Performs as described.,These hooks performed as described. I used one on a painted kitchen cabinet and one on a painted wall. I removed the one on the cabinet to test removal and it was quite easy.Pros: Easy to apply. Easy to remove. No residue left behind. I have plaster walls so these proved exceptionally useful for my situation.Caveats: Be sure and read the weight limitations. The ones I tested hold up to 3 lbs. Cannot use near heat source (such as near cook stove) as can lose adhesion above 105 degrees. The hook is rather thick so objects with small holes for hanging will not work with these hooks.I was pleased with this product and will probably purchase more to use elsewhere in my home where a hook can be handy.06-03-11 Update: I did purchase some more hooks in the same 3M line after using these. They are really very handy in those places where you don't want to drill or screw a hook.
4,Great Hooks!,"These hooks are a great alternative to putting holes in your walls. The Command Hooks work great once you follow the directions to the letter. You have to make sure the mounting surfaces are clean AND dust-free before installation. After installing the hooks, give the adhesive at least an hour to cure before use. This should ensure a firm and tight adhesion. Once the hour has passed, the hooks are in place until you are ready to remove them. Plain, simple, and just works! Highly recommended!"
4,Exactly what I was looking for,These 3M Hooks were exactly what I was looking for.. I want to hang 2 items and both were in strange locations that a nail would not work..1st was on my Front Door with is almost all glass.. I wanted to hang a Spring Wreath but couldn't find a hanger that would work .. then these arrived and wow did exactly what I wanted I can put up the wreath and when no longer want one easy as pie to remove the hook..2nd location was in the bathroom just wanted a sm hook to hold a hand towel but again in a strange place .. that is all ceramic tile so no nail would work without damage.. well again 3M hook saved the day. and in minutes it was up and doing its thing.Very very pleased with this product and will look for more sizes to use for other jobs I have for it around my house..Like it a LOT !
2,Didn't last long,"Had the hook up less than a week holding a bag up, the hook fell off the first time I lifted the bag off of it. It wasnt that big eitherVery big disappointment -- No pun intended"
4,Seems to be holding!,"I was doubtful about trying these 'sticky' hooks but I decided to give them a try. After nearly two weeks, the items are still safely on our living room wall and I did try removing and replacing with another sticky. And you know what? It works as advertised. Don't know if I would hang anything heavier than recommended (as many people tend to do sometimes with hooks) but for the stated and advertised purpose of hanging light weight items without leaving a gummy residue, they are great!"
4,Holds smaller items well,"I used these to mount some family pictures on the wall and the small frames of less than five pounds work well. I wouldn't recommend these for large, heavy items."
4,Save some space,The last time I bought some of these hooks I put one up before using alcohol on the wall and the other used alcohol. Helps to read directions now and then. The one used after alcohol is still on the wall. The other one fell off. So I've learned my lesson and will use these to hang more items in my furnace/laundry room that is pretty small. They're very handy.
5,"Very durable, good quality and value","I really recommend this product, before I bought it, I had spent lots of money on other 3.5mm stereo extension cables which all of them died less than 3 months. but this one stayed functional for more than 5 months now, and it has better quality and not more expensive than the previously bought cables."
3,good game,its a great game. dont like the fact that your generals cant get killed only wounded.but once you have played take command 2nd Manassas this will no longer be as good or as fun to you.its just not as deep and the graphics are not up to par. a great game for its time but its time is long past. your better off getting 2nd manassas or Gettysburg scourge of war.
3,civil war,its ok. not the best game in the world. but i did have fun with it. just got old and the graphics is not the best but again its cheap and worth its money.
1,cannot play aganist the computer.,"this game,is made for 2-8 people play.i just want to play aganist the computer.i hate to go online,to find other people,to challenge."
1,Too out of date...,I was looking for a cheap game that would hopefully give me a few hours of entertainment. This was not the right choice...way too out of date.
5,Reply to Trenton NJ,"My husband loves these games...but couldn't get them to work when we upgraded our computer. Go to www.firaxis.com, then choose DOWNLOADS at top of the page. There is a download for the civil war games to make them compatible to Windows XP. The Gettysburg game we still get an error message, but if you choose to run it from the Programs menu, it's fine. Good luck!"
2,Buy Sid Meier's Gettysburg instead,"For some reason, this collection of three games (Gettysburg, Antietam, South Mountain) has more technical glitches and bugs than the standalone release of Gettysburg. I experienced so many audio and video problems in Antietam and South Mountain that I have to pronounce them unplayable. Your results may vary, but Sid Meier's Gettysburg was a better buy for me."
5,FUN AND EXCITING!,"This is as good as strategy gaming gets. Three games recreate pivotal events in American history. From the Union push on the Confederate defenses at South Mountain, to the bloody fields and roads of Antietam, and on to the massacre that is Gettysburg, relive the bloodiest days of America's past! Grade: A+"
5,"Great game, hope to see future advanced release","* The game's control lets you focus on the strategy, not keyboad typing or mouse moving. So you can enjoy more in virtual commanding.* Out of my experience in playing all kinds of civil war games, dos or win, this is the best (the whole collection).* Of course it has room to improve to increase the enjoyments:- General quick attention (1~9 are not enough)- Variants of brigade format: surrounding format, for example- F1 map overview scrollable- Mini map for quick locating or pointing to move troops, and points of fighting or attention- Brigade charge function- Commanding by bugle- Bridges grouping- More division or corp level commands- Location bookmarks for quick checking- Commander replacing or switching or promotion or demotion- General review info- etcIt is a fun game and makes you feel like a general"
2,Duplicate - Do not purchase,"My daughter was very excited to see a volume 2 of this series and I purchased it for her for Christmas. When we got it, we discovered the packaging had been changed but the episodes were the same as in Volume 1.The series itself is good, but not so good that I wanted 2 copies of everything."
4,Great basket,"This is a great basket. It fits well on the bike rack, holds a lot, and is easy to get on and off. My one quibble is that the handle fell off within the first 5 rides (and while I was biking). They might want to figure out a better handle system because it is a useful feature. Or perhaps mine got a bit too shaken up in shipping. But other than that it's been a fantastic basket and I'm very happy with it."
4,Great roomy basket!,"A great basket but trying to figure out how to get it to stay on our electric bike. With bungy cords attached, it still falls off when traveling."
1,broke right away,"after a few weeks of use one of the rubber things that attaches it to the bike rack, fell off somewhere, rendering the whole thing uselessbig waste of money, which is shame since it cost more than many other similar items"
4,A good product,"I bought this for grocery runs in my neighborhood. It can hold about 2 full grocery bags. The spring-loaded attachment is a nice feature for quick release of the basket when I get home, but we'll see how long it holds up. The handle is a pain to deal with -- always coming out of its socket and whatnot. I fashioned my own bungee-type covering so items don't fly out going over bumps. (I recommend finding some sort of cover to go with this basket if you live in a bumpy area) But all in all it fit perfectly with a bike mount I purchased at Sports Authority, and that's all that mattered at the moment was an easily mountable basket that could do the job."
4,Bicycle basket,"The basket is easy to mount, quite steady and firmly attached to the rack, and does the job. What else could you want in a bike basket?"
5,Excellent Basket,"I've had this basket for three years now, and it has been a very wise and excellent buy. I just got back from a trip to our community garden and again, this basket saves the day. I also use it to put in my library books and have used it for when I was taking college classes and rode to school. Along with a bike rack, it is very sturdy and it is very convenient to simply take it off and go in wherever one needs to go which includes the grocery store..."
2,not the best....,the basket itself is sturdy but the quick release spring loaded handles that attach the basket to your rack are terrible. i ended up having to secure the basket with bungee cords.
3,Could Use ONE Improvement,"Another reviewer posted a photo of attaching the basket longways with the rear rack. The product is intended to mount perpendicular to the rack. Wouldn't cost too much more if the consumer had a choice of which way to mount the basket, and still be able to use the quick mounting grips instead of a laced bungee chord. It could also use some rubber in the mounting grips so the basket didn't rely so heavily on a raised rat-trap. Folks without rat-trap racks will want to figure out a way to prevent the basket sliding rearward.Still, it's a good, sturdy basket...buy the cargo net, too. I make nets, so I didn't need one, but you'll find the basket's versatility greatly improved by a cargo net."
4,"Easy portability, but a bit wobbly","I read the reviews before purchasing this basket a couple of months ago, so was aware of some of the issues other reviewers had. I've been happy with this product since getting it. It is a bit wobbly when on the bike, but I bought the bungie net to go over it and connect it to the bike rack more securely. The net also keeps my items in the basket. The basket is easy to remove and put back on. I carry it into stores with me. It makes a great grocery basket for small items. If you do purchase this basket I would suggest the small cargo net."
2,Great looking and super convenient but broke after one summer,"I only used this a couple of times a week, never carrying more than 10 lbs and the bottom part that attaches itself to the rack broke. The basket itself remains in great condition. I can re-attach it as a semi-permanent fixture but would love to figure out how to fix it bringing it back to its original super quick attachment/detachment form. Great idea, nice looking but unfortunately has issues with quality and/or design of the attachment unit."
4,Easy to put on and take off,"I've had this basket for about 6 weeks now so can't testify about its long term durability, but it seems strong and sturdy. I like that I can easy remove it when I get home and carry it inside using the convenient handle. When I need to use it again I can just click it back on. It's useful for holding my handbag or gym bag. I also sometimes ride my bike to the grocery store and find that it doesn't hold much more than a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread, but with one of those cargo nets to keep things in place, I'm sure you could cram more into it. The disadvantage with having a rear basket for me is that I am sometimes afraid that passers-by could easily steal something that's in there if I'm stopped at a traffic light (more of an issue if I'm riding on the sidewalk) ... I feel especially nervous with my handbag in there!"
2,"Great idea, but broke on first ride!",Attaches easily and quickly with no tools. The welding broke on the bottom bracket which holds the basket to the bike rack. I'm sending it back. Not sure what carrying solution to try next.
4,Great basket with some obvious limitations,"I've had this basket for almost a year now. It's really great for grocery shopping, since it doubles as a hand basket, but there are two important things to understand about the clip mechanism:1) The clips will probably not hold the loaded basket on your rack without bungie cords or a bungie net (I use the latter since it also keeps my groceries from bouncing out). The clips are very useful for keeping the basket stable while you are loading/unloading, but don't try to ride without bungie support.2) The clips are glued to the bottom of the basket, rather than welded. This means that they will likely come unglued fairly quickly with frequent use. My solution was to re-glue them and strap them to the basket with nylon cable ties.I'm giving this basket four stars because these are easy fixes, and it is much more practical for shopping than a bolted-on basket or pannier bags."
1,The problem is in the shipping,"This product looks great. I ordered it, and it arrived crushed. I returned it with this explanation, but the replacement item was similarly crushed. I have tried working with customer service and emailing the shipping people to explain that the problem is the box they are using for shipping is too shallow for the item. I'm most frustrated that they haven't communicated very well. One person told me the item would be removed from the website while the problem was being addressed and then it would reappear and that's how I would know that the issue had been resolved. That doesn't sound like adequeate customer service to me. I still want this item but I am going to shop elsewhere, and perhaps look for something different."
2,"After 3 Months Of Regular Use, It Broke","The Kettler Rear Bicycle Basket has some problems. Primarily, the spot welds wear out over time. After 3 months of daily use (mostly groceries, about 5-10 Lbs), the welds which connect the bottom brackets to the basket itself simply wore out--the brackets are the lower handles shown in the picture provided by Amazon. Now, there is no way to attach the basket to my bicycle rack. I believe the bumps and vibrations of my daily ride slowly weakened these welds to the point that they detached. The basket had other problems as well (over uneven pavement, it would occasionally fly off and tumble into the street), but the poor welding is what ultimately rendered the basket totally unworkable.I would not recommend this basket."
3,"It's a great idea, however....","Parts of it come off quite easily.I REALLY like this basket and was really excited when it came in the mail. I used it once and then when I removed it from the bike rack, one of the rubber stopper/holder things on the bottom popped off as did the spring. Luckily, I was able to find both pieces and put them back on. It was about the third time I used the basket when two of the rubber holder things and springs fell off and now I can't find one of the rubber holders. It's frustrating because I think this is a great basket, but now I need to figure out a new way to attach it to the rack."
2,"It's ok, but it broke",I bought this a year ago and the part that connects the attachments to the basket came apart. I really didn't use it for very heavy items and rarely used it. I am going to try to find someone to fix it.
3,Rear Basket,"I purchased the bicycle basket for my 3wheeler,so my small dog could ride with me. It is a little small but my bike is a fold up so it is OK."
1,Doesn't fit my rack,"I use the stock Bontrager rack that came with my Trek Soho DLX, and it's too skinny for this basket. A note in the product description on minimum rack thickness would have saved me a lot of hassle."
2,"Don't do it, really.","I bought this watch for my son. We both love the way it looks, and figured that since it was a Timex, quality shouldn't be a problem. However, within 2 weeks of getting it, the second hand fell off and rattled around inside. We returned it, and Amazon was prompt in sending us another one. Unfortunately, it only took one week for the second hand to fall off of the replacement watch. Don't buy this watch. One could have been a fluke- two is bad workmanship."
4,good value,"recieved this watch two days ago, would have to agree with the gentlemanthat the silver dials are too small to read, however for under 30 bucks you can;t beat it. yes its a little heavy but I like that, the band can be inlarged for a big man like myself and to big dials are easy to read, came in perfect condition in 4 days, another winner, amazon"
4,Saving Beauty from the Beast,"I encourage every parent of a daughter to read this book before their daughter starts dating. It details behaviors and actions to be aware of in the boys their children date -- behaviors that are initially perceived as loving and protective, but are actually controlling and manipulative, and become emotional and eventually physical abuse."
1,could be written by a first grader,"Don't waste your time on this worthless book. Ask a taxi driver for more complete up to date information. Or better yet, go online. It is quite an insult. Obviously written for publicity reasons. Since it is not much more than in infomercial, you shouldn't pay for it. The information is inaccurate and misleading. This book could be harmful."
2,missing something,"This album, unlike the others, is missing a certain something...As always, with all the McCain albus there are some songs that are absolutly wonderful...this album only has two, in my opinion. Sad thing is that this album really makes McCain sound like someone fresh out of the clubs....LIke I said, this one is missing a certain something."
1,"Terrible, Horrible, Awful","I've been a McCain fan for quite some time...and, this album is terrible. I'm sorry, but it is. It's horrible. Honor Among Thieves and Misguided Roses showcased Edwin's songwriting and singing talents...Messenger seemed like a rushed album meant to cash in on the the pop success of ""I'll Be."" Fine, whatever...at least it's not this album, which is just terrible. I don't know what happened to Edwin's songwriting capabilities, and to his penchant for creating catchy and memorable melodies...but this album has no memorable songs, except for maybe ""Hearts Fall,"" which like ""I'll Be"" could be the theme for just about any romantic comedy produced in the last 5 years. All I can say Edwin, is what happened to the passion and self-introspection that inspired such amazing songs as ""Tip of my Tongue"" and ""Alive""???"
4,4 Star movie here,"The movie is good, but it is not fantastic or incredible.It has a real good story line. Good acting from everyone in the movie.The ending was done fairly well, and you will be feeling good whenthe movie is over! The movie is uplifting."
5,Excellent message - terrific story!,"Excellent message - how one person can change how a whole town lives by simply saying ""What would Jesus do?"" This movie is loosly based on the 1898 novel, ""In His Steps: What would Jesus Do?"" by Charles Sheldon. The names are the same, but the story takes a modern tone, but the valuable lesson is the same. A drifter, played by John Schneider is shunned by the community even the pastor of a dying church, played by Jim Gleason, tells him ""I'm sorry that I can't help you."" But the message the drifter brings to a church is ""would Jesus act that way?"" As church members start changing the way they do things from running their businesses to helping the less fortunate, the wave of love and goodness takes over the town even when a greedy, ruthless politician wants to take over.This message is vital to the world in this day and age. Imagine what would happen if every Christian would think before acting and ask themselves ""what would Jesus do in my place?[...]"
2,Maybe for kids....,"I rented this movie and was glad I did before I purchased it. Although the story line was a good premise...the ruined it with bad acting. The only actor who seemed at all genuine was John Schneider.About half way through the movie my friends and I just looked at each other and laughed. With most Christian movies, you expect low budget. You expect little to no special effects, but a good message.This message was...ok. But the acting was horrible. I mean just aweful. And I like Christian movies alot. It was flat and unbelievable. However, the theme song is catchy.I would rent this and see if you like it before you buy it. Or buy a cheaper copy.Some kids may like it, as kids don't quite understand good acting yet."
4,Inspirational Approach to Modern Day problem solving.,WWJD is a thoughtful movie with a hopeful message about improving one's self and one's community. A Christ like figure visits a small rural town with economic problems and gives everyone hope through his own example of living.
2,"Low budget, but OK.","I had just finished the book, In His Steps, which was written by Charles M. Sheldon and was later called What Would Jesus Do? for the movie. I can't quite say what was missing, but the story line was still there. I kept this DVD, but I am not sure why. The book was so good and the movie was so average. I think it was the fact that they put it in modern days instead of using the correct era it was written in."
1,Awful,"The premise of the movie is great, but this movie did not deliver. The script was terrible, the characters weren't real and the acting was awful. It was extremely slow paced."
2,"Concept - great, but final outcome - poor","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but was disappointed. John Schneider was the only good acting that I could see. It was a shame that the message was so good, but didn't come off well. The ""bad guy"" character was a charade and ""too"" phoney ""bad"". There wasn't any realness to most of the characters. The fact that they chose a woman to be the ""good"" mayor bothered me. Good and godly male leaders is what we need in this world (of course, that's just my personal feeling that I would have liked to have seen in the movie).On a side note, I watched a movie called ""Radio"" that caught the realness and godliness of living for others. It is a shame that It wasn't advertised with a Christian name such as this one, because that it is definitely what was happening in that movie. I highly recommend that movie if you want to see Christ-like living."
5,Awesome Dvd!,This dvd shipped fast. The price was good. The dvd taught valuable lessons and is a great teaching tool. I highly recommend this dvd to others.
3,Great Message and Enjoyable......3.5 Star Rating,"The acting at times is very slow and not stellar, but the message (if you stop to listen) is awesome and although it is not a show I would watch over and over, it is a once-a-year DVD. John Schneider does a great job, the other actors are not as experienced, but it does clearly make many a good point and makes you stop and realize what is important in life."
2,"Good Message, Slow Movie","The message of the movie was good, but the movie itself was low budget,slow moving and boring. I'd recommend reading the book the movie was based on instead, ""In His Steps What Would Jesus Do?"" It was a really good book with the same true story and the same good message."
1,"Read the book, skip the movie.","I read the book, ""In His Steps,' by Charles Sheldon. Excellent. I read the book, 'What Would Jesus Do,' written by Charles Sheldon's son - which was a 'modern-day retelling' of the book by his father. It was also excellent. I was so excited for this movie, but it didn't even follow 1/2 of the storyline of the book. Sometimes movies are good - just different - despite the fact that they strayed from the book, but this one destroyed itself. It should have just stuck with the storyline and it maybe could have survived. The changes that they made totally destroyed the story, making it almost unbearable to watch. If the storyline was good I could have put up with the horrible acting, but there was nothing good about this movie. I am giving my copy to goodwill, and would not recommend this to anyone!! Read the book. :-) (P.S. I generally like most movies, and this is the first movie I have bought and given away because it was just plain rotten!)"
5,LIFE CHAINGING,This just changed my life the messege is amzing.I will recomend this to everyone. And I will ask my self evey Day:WHAT WOULD JESUS DO?.
5,Buy this version...great for all ages and any audience!,"I got a copy of the original book..and it's better than any ""revised"" edition, they've come up with, so far. I bought an older version of this movie..and I don't know what, exactly's wrong with that one...but, seems that old one didn't say what the original book said. This one does...it nails it. And it's not some pansy-fied movie, either...This is a really good and well-made movie, that the entire family can enjoy together. Buy it~You'll Luv it!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"If it was possible to give this movie zero stars I would. The writing is pathetic as is the photography. How they ever sold ""over 40 million"" according to the cover is beyond me. Heck, I wanted my money back after the first 20 minutes.Most of the main characters are adult white males and there is no depth. Real life situations would be more impressive than the pseudo down-and-out characters they try to portray. Everyone is one-dimensional and a high schooler could write better. Everything feels staged, even the delivery of the message the film makers were trying to get across.While the movie tried to show characters using the teachings of Jesus in real-life situations it fell terribly short and used way too many stereotypes. Please save your money and get something else instead."
1,"NO, Closed Caption",My husband and I would love to see this movie but it has no closed caption on this DVD. It is very sad that they didn't put it on it. Jesus would love us to see the movie but can't understand what it been said.
3,Exact functional replacement,"The replacement carafe came in manufacturer's packaging material packed in Amazon's packaging material so arrived intact in package much larger than the carafe itself. Black plastic lid and handle to match my coffeemaker would have been nicer, but since I keep and use the coffeemaker in my office it doesn't matter; and if it ever does matter and I'm looking for something to do I kept the black handle and lid from the broken carafe and can replace the white pieces with black pieces. I probably wouldn't have bought this from Amazon, but when my carafe broke the store nearest my office that should have had the replacement carafe didn't have it, then someone gave me an Amazon gift certificate so I used my gift certificate to replace my carafe."
3,Fits but spills,"This replacement decanter fits in my coffee maker, but if you don't pour it very slowely it spills all over."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this as a replacement for my coffee maker just 4 months ago and it has come apart already. I brewed some coffee as I normally would and on this day, as I picked up the pot the handle just completely came detached from the pot and coffee spilled all over the counter top. I would not recommend this as a replacement for your coffee maker."
2,Well,"Well, not much you can say about a 4 cup decanter - other than this company, in their endless desire to suck revenue out of consumers, does not use the same style of decanter in all of their 4 cup brewers. They aren't all that common anyway, so you would think they would be standard, but they're not. This replacement is slightly taller than the thin walled one that came with the brewer, resulting in it being difficult to place under the filter housing. It's annoying.Which is why they have now bought the license rights to sell a Keurig with their name on it. I personally detest the whole Keurig system, and think the coffee that system brews is not any better than the old freeze dried instant stuff we used to get. . .but I'm obviously in the minority on that one."
3,"Lightweight glass, so buy one right now before yours breaks","I actually love the now $17 Mr. Coffee coffee maker that this belongs to, it's just that the glass is rather light in the decanter. You may as well buy a replacement right now because eventually you'll nix it. And, you need this exact size for the valve on the bottom of the coffee funnel apparatus to work correctly. A+ for the coffee maker. Recipe for it:Yuban Organic Medium Roast Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)6 T coffee, 3-6 oz. cups of water (to the 3 mark on the Mr. Coffee) + 4 oz. whole (Smart & Final Organic) milk = 2 PERFECT cups of coffee for 50 cents/cup. This is 90% less than Starbucks, and it's organic. Enjoy!"
5,perfect size,"I bought this for a tight space on my counter, and I'm pleased that it fits perfectly! Very happy."
2,Only worth it in a crisis,"I have a Mr. Coffee 4 cup machine, and when my glass decanter broke I originally bought this replacement, but I'm really disappointed with it. To my mind, it is functionally not compatible with the 4 cup machine like it should be - this is really a 5 cup decanter (you can see this because when you click on the picture you can see the 4 cup mark and the fact that the glass extends well above this line). While it technically does fit if you shove it under the machine and jerk it out again, you really shouldn't do that with a) glass and b) hot liquids. I regularly have to replace my decanter because the glass just doesn't last as long as the original machine, but I'll never buy this one again, I'll buy one that is actually 4 cups."
4,An American Humorist,"This is a good documentary on the life of Wil Rogers, a plain-spoken American with profound thoughts, and a truth teller to power."
4,"FIFA 2001, better in defending and motion","The defending by the computer is definitely better than ever. At last there is a decent defense. Als the motions are improved. Good. But I think the FIFA concept has been worked out. unless they come with some brilliant renewal, this was the last version I bought (after four years)."
3,Only the visuals are better,"3 stars if you already have a prior FIFA sequel. 4+ stars if you don't.Expect sharp visuals, both animation & graphics (with a 3D accelerator). Nice touches with the linesmen & cameramen. However, the AI & refereeing is still biased towards the computer - this is most noticeable on quick counter-attacks. Pitches are larger. Commentary is more consistent & not so delayed as in other FIFA titles. The game still freezes occasionally mid-game for no apparent reason (Tip: save after each game). I realize this is no consolation if you are winning. Transfer market is still unrealistic (EA needs to take a leaf out of Actua Soccer 3).All in all, a game that is perhaps more stunning to watch or else better to play against a friend."
3,"some good, some bad","The graphics of this version has really improved from the previous ones. It's a little more realistic because it finally has a shoot power controlling feature. AI is also a success. However, the game is still being really unfair. The refree gives foul to almost every tackle I've made, and it's extremely RARE for me to recieve free kicks. The other features are almost the same as the older ones. Players always run away from the ball, players making impossible moves, AI goalies making ""awesome"" saves, my own goalie as dumb as usual, etc. Let me give this comment to EA: Making the game unfair isn't going to develop a good game, although AI needs improvemets."
4,Better then previous version,"This game is quite a lot better then its predecessors, - a lot more realism, better control and realistic scenes. However I did expect more. Fifa 2000 was a lot better then Fifa 1999. The overall increase makes me re think whether I should have skipped the 2001 release and waited for the 2002 release."
5,best football game out there,"I was watching a football match on TV... on wait, it's just the new fifa game... they made the pitch bigger, they added the linesman... on each side :), the players look like their respective real life counterparts (and move like them as well), the stadiums (not many though) look stunning, they brought back the great commentators back... good lord people, even if you're not a gamer, get yourself this game, so when they're showing golf on ESPN, just load this game up and watch some football!"
1,Better stick with FIFA 2000,"The only thing that is a bit better in FIFA 2001 compared to previous versions are the graphics. Otherwise it has gotten worse: The game is slow, if you pass the ball it goes in slow motion and stops after just a few yards. The teams are not complete: Portugal is simply not there despite the fact that they played extremely well this year. European championships are a simple playoff. No groups to qualify for the next round, ...In my opinion, a typical game that was created by people who might know a lot about graphics, but have never touched a soccer ball in their lives.It's a pitty, because you could make this game a lot of fun with some minimal work. Instead the main focus seems to be on the stadium advertisments."
5,a beautiful and sensitive spiritual and sensual movie,This was an amazingly well written movie that was capable of being erotic and intelligent...one of my favorite movies of all times.
2,This COULD'VE BEEN really good! Instead it's just mediocre.,"I had very mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, the ideas and subject matter were quite interesting and rarely found in the bowels of Hollywood. On the other, the acting and dialogue were horrendously amateurish...I found myself laughing out loud every 5 minutes or so, at just how cheesy and clumsy it often got. Kind of like a video version of the ""Celestine Prophecy,"" only about sex. Like the latter, it can be quite helpful to many people, I'm sure."
4,Great Beer and Popcorn Movie,"I first saw this movie on cable and later was able to pick upaused copy at Blockbuster. Definitely worth it...as the film exploresan area that standard hollywood fare doesn't ---- tantric sex practices. A great beer and popcorn movie that's you'll talk about and, hopefully, act out after the film is over. This is the stuff STING claims keeps him going for 12 hours. As long as the film doesn't take itself too seriously its enjoyable - the sex is pretty good, the acting good enough, and the dialogue almost laughable considering the subject. I do think the sexual abuse side plot revealed at the end was unneccessary but doesn't hurt the overall theme. I guess the author/director couldn't come up with a problem strong enought to cause the female lead to seek out a sexologist so he went with the old reliable theme of sexual abuse. This film is best watched as a pop primer on advanced sexual practices."
4,Too real to be entertaining for most people!,"A lovely movie with much to say about men and women; sexuality, self awareness, and hope. The story's vehicle, that being sexual dysfunction due to molestation, is tragic; however, this movie speaks in an intelligent and genuine voice about trust, respect and intimacy. On the lighter side -- maybe those looking for a thrill will be educated."
3,An OK sexual-pychological movie,"Pretty well done movie about a couple struggling with sexual baggage brought to the marriage. They throw in some short sex scenes which are regularly spaced through the movie and give it more of a European feel, but it appears to be American with setting and language. Why not a higher rating? Well, its just sort of adolecent in its approach to sex. Its like the writer is addressing a personal experience from his youth."
5,Thrilled,"I was so delighted to get another copy of this therapeutic movie. Someone stole the one I had! There is just so much insight especially for someone who was hurt and abused in the past. Men can also learn alot from watching this. Yes, there are some erotic scenes etc, but I would strongly recommend couples watching this together and each on their own.This movie helps one to understand and respect the deeper meaning, why's and how's of lovemaking. Definately adult watching."
2,BLISS,"Boring skin flick - mediocre acting......Only ENDING was worth viewing --when film began to ""Get Real""......Sex Guru??.....I became disinterested quickly ....... until the last fifteen minutes."
3,Seems to be helping,I have been dieting and exercising as well. So there are other factors as well to my personal success with Lipo Sculpting gel
5,It works in time !!!!,This product actually works im a non believer when it comes to things like this but it actually works if u use asdirected u may get better results if u work out but i dont have time for all that but i have lost about 4 inches in3weeks i took before and after pics totally amazing......non-believer Fayetteville N.C.
1,NO EFFECTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT,I don't know why i brought this item ??? i didn't even like the product ... i used it two times a day .. no effect then i used it before GYM .. NO effect.. i dont know.. i am not seeing any effect ...
2,Didn't work for me......,I did not find this product to work at all. I have a good amount of cellulite and using this product faithfully every day did absolutely nothing. My cellulite looked the same. I don't think rubbing a cream on your skin will permanently help cellulite. I believe the correct physical exercises and a clean diet would have more of an effect on the problem. I have started the ULBHT Makeover by Joey Atlas and I think this might do the trick. I met a woman who has been doing it for six weeks now and she saw a huge improvement on the cellulite on her lower body.
1,did not work for me..,"I have used this product for 27 days, till the last drop in the bottle. I used it exactly as directed. I did not notice any ""slimming"" in the areas applied nor did the cellulite disappear. The only good thing is that the gel does not have a sticky texture after it is applied, it soaks into your skin directly. I am very disappointed, however, as I seriously expected this to work with the high rates, and the over-pricing. I don't recommend it to anyone."
2,Nothing so far,"Fast shipping allright.I'm a fitness instructor, healthy, drink water and work-out......I haven't seen any difference soo far though I followed the instruction and used it before my intense work-outs... Ok my skin is slightly better but for 10 buck you can get the Goodbye cellulite from Nivea and have the same results (even better) and this product is [...] buck!! Either I got a too old one (didn't feel any slight tingling sensation as it is said on the box, sign of it's working) Either this is total Bologna as I suspect and I lost about 40 bucks......Keep your money...no no don't thank me :)"
1,Be aware you may be alergic to it,"I'm allergic to it because my blood pressure soared and heart rate became irregular. I stopped using it after using it for 3 days. It took over 3 days for my blood pressure and heart rate to get normal. Since it is very costly to get some refund , I just give it away to someone else who doesn't seem to be alergic to it."
4,Seems to be working,"The consistency is great and goes on easily. It's like putting on a body cream. I've noticed a definate improvement on my thighs and buttocks. I will keep on using it because I feel it's working...seems like after you pass 30 yrs old, the cellulite and fat get harder to get rid of...ugh!"
3,Cream,"I've been using the product for a few Weeks now and it's working, I wear it before going to the gym. I put it on my most needed areas."
4,Still too soon,I haven't used it enough to see the changes yet. I am still hopeful that it will help me in losing the unwanted body fat that I have left over from my recent pregnancy. I can say that I did feel the warm sensation that the instructions indicated. So still hopeful.
5,.....works for me,I have been using celluthin for 1 month and my stomach (with hard effort at the gym) is getting more toned. I am happy with this product.
3,Just placed my first order of Lipo Sculpt Gel,"I've heard so many good things about this cellulite gel, and I actually know some women that are using it and are thrilled with the results.I can't wait to start using it too."
4,Good Product,"The product did produce some results, not fascinating results, but I did notice improvement! When comparing it to Avon's brand of anti-cellulite treatment though, I find they both do the same job equally, with Avon being way, WAY, cheaper (so I'm headed back to the cheaper side : )"
2,Month 3 and still rubbing,"I read all the reviews and thought I would try Lipo Sculpt. I have deep cellulite so I was not expecting any miracles. So far, my waist is the same and my behind still dimples at me and my thighs show a slight, very slight improvement. I am not overweight and I'm on my third bottle with one more to go. Sure is an expensive experiment."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I ordered this product a few days ago and I get this beat up, obviously used, box. The jar was half full, the label was peeling, the pump was dirty and obviously used. I called Customer Service and talked to Jimmy and he told me to send it back at my expense and that someone must have ""tampered"" with - most likely teh UPS! Gimme a break! UPS? I explained the box didnt look tampered with and the original tape was on the box but it was like trying to negotiate with a used car salesman! He kept insisting it wasn't them and that some third party tampered with it.ALSO, THE REVIEW WRITTEN FOR THIS PRODUCT WHERE THE AUTHOR CLAIMED SHE LOST 45 POUNDS IS FALSE. IF YOU LOOK UP ALL THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL SEE THE EXACT SAME REVIEW.Save your money and the aggravation."
2,Over-rated,This product is way over-rated. I used both cutting gel and this product and Cutting Gel worked far better than this one. The only strong point for this product is it won't stain clothes. If you want obvious results buy cutting gel not this impostor.
3,"Decent Guide, Better Regions","I actually live in Lyon, and this Guide Vert is an important collection to my library of Guide Verts. The guide is not bad, though there are some places they overrate and others they underrate. They should give more credit to Cremieu, for example, and maybe less to some parts of the Beaujolais.The other problem with this book is that it ""spills"" over into other regions. You find le Puy en Valley and the Ardeche, for example, in more than one of the Guide Verts. In both cases, these places are not really in the Rhone Valley and they are a long drive along secondary roads.Provence is the best region in France, and thus has the best books."
2,Anecdotal and shallow analysis,Lacks penetrating insight to allow application of learning to present day problems. A series of historical anecdotes. Publicity overrated. Misses the significance of human rights. I agree with Thomas Powers review in the Atlantic Monthly and the jbothern review. .
2,very disappointing,"Boy, is this book overrated!The writing style is academic, to put it kindly.The author never gets around to convincingly proving her initially stated theses.At points, especially on the last page, amazingly out-of-place politically correct personal views leap off the page."
2,Blood Rites,"I was very disappointed by this book. As someone who is interested in History, Sociology and the place of the military in society, i thought i would find something in it that, even if i did not agree with, provoked me. I did not. Perhaps some specialists will find this interesting, but i found it very boring. Why does it remain on my bookshelf? The occassional quote for a history paper is all that is keeping it there at the moment."
3,mostly speculation,"An imaginative attempt to understand the origins of war, an essay that relies primarily upon the author's sensitive, and often sensible, imagination.The book's style favors an irritating, superfluous, and promiscuous use of quotation marks when not actually quoting. Thus, she places quotation marks around Long Gray Line and drive, for example. By frequently doing this, she distracts the reader from her argument."
1,A book totally without value.,"It is seldom that I start a book and not finish it, but this one truely deserves the trash can. She makes the most rediculous claims and then has nothing to back them up. Nothing but pure speculation."
1,This book has to be a joke.,"The author doesn't inform, or define or back up her opinions at all in this ""book"". She just makes wild claims, spins already twisted facts and rants."
1,It just doesn't do the job,"This product doesn't shred properly. Pieces of paper remain connected at the end, and the blades don't seem to be cutting properly. It also has trouble sensing thin pieces of paper like receipts. I can not do work with a product that works like this. In addition, the strips are very wide. I believe it's worth doing the research to end up with a shredder that works better than this."
1,Keep searching,"I realize that this shredder comes with a bottom of the barrel price, but even for $19, one would expect that it would at least perform the functions claimed on the box - it doesn't. It is a piece of junk. It doesn't sense paper when inserted, it keeps spinning indefinitely after shredding because the paper doesn't fall completely from the shredder, and it simply does a horrible job shredding and leaves nearly intact sheets at the bottom of the bin.This is certainly one of the cheapest shredders out there, I am not sure you could beat the cost, but spend a few more bucks and get one that actually works. Fellowes really should be ashamed of themselves for this model. I spent about $20 more on the Royal VF700 and love it."
1,Cheap Piece of Junk,"You get what you pay for. I thought I could use the cheapest shredder since I wouldn't be using it heavily, just to shred a few pages a day, and not everyday. Well, after a couple months, it got jammed and then all of sudden it died. I wish I spent a few more bucks for a better shredder which would have been cheaper in the long run."
1,Piece of junk!,"Does it shred? Yes. Is it worth $26? NO. Perhaps $9.99, but definitely not $26. If you put more than a couple of pieces of paper in it, it won't shred it properly and you'll have to put it through again. I read the reviews prior to ordering and wish I would have followed other peoples' advice :-("
1,Read other fellowes reviews,"Buy carefully, This model only has one other review, but other Fellowes shredders have terrible reviews. I bought a Royal and have been very happy."
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this shredder. It is very noise and doesn't shred in 1/4"" strips as the description states. Most of the time, it doesn't even shred part of the paper so you have this piece of paper with little ""teeth"" that weren't separated when it went through the shredder."
3,Light Duty Tasking,"Fellowes P-5 Powershred is a light duty shredder good for assisting with dailytasks.It is important to follow directions,do not overload beyond capacity."
1,Not worth it,This product broke within the first 24 hours of being used. The hard plastic cracked. I replaced it with a hard rubber form which has worked great. A little more money but worth it.
1,Don't buy these!,"Bought several of these. If you can get your mic into it and leave it in, you're okay. If you have to take your mic in and out, expect it to break in a couple of turns.Two of them broke just trying to put my Pyle mics into them the first time. Find a different clip."
3,broke the first week BUT would be fine if handled right,"Ok so it broke right away, BUT these are drunk karaoke singers who are crazy. It would be fine under normal professional care."
3,Best now in Print,"Mike Svob has done a very good on this book, and has included a few new rivers, but the definative work still has to be the 1972 ""Canoe Trails of Northeastern Wisconsin"", by Wisconsin Trails Magazine, now long out of print. The maps are better, and the entire river is mapped, not just the turisty sections. If you are just going for a day or two, this is a good book, but if you want to travel a longer distance, find the original maps."
5,Great resource,This book is a great resource when looking for paddling trips in Northern Wisconsin. I have found it to be helpful planning trips to rivers we have never been kayaking on before. If you are a paddler in N WI this is a must have!
5,Favourite Alert!!,"This is the second best (natural) string I (and the rest of my team) have ever used. It's cool for matches and practice. (Like the VS Touch) The only thing that might affect using it so regularly is that its tension falls. It gets annoying after a while, specially if you know how a good synthetic gut holds. However, if you have the monetary support and the crave for feel and spin, this is as good as it gets."
4,Insulation explained,"I ordered this manual with the idea of planning to add additional insulation in my attic as well as trying to seal the ""leaks"" of cold air in winter. This book was a wonderful choice as it is easy to understand, offers suggestions about types of insulation and relates the pros and cons of each type. Taking that a step further, there are tables that show the amount of insulation needed by types of insulation and location. This is a wonderful buy! Thanks."
4,Packed with good advice,"This is a fantastic book on the subject. Not only does it cover insulating, it covers furnaces, hot water and a host of other topics to save you a few bucks. I would have given a 5 if it the sections on basement insulating were more robust. Really, it is a 4.5 stars. I would highly recommend this book."
3,Attic Chaos,"We recently removed and replaced the insulation in our attic. The book was helpful, but not as helpful as the man at Home Depot."
4,Learned Some Things,"I live in a condo so not every part of this book was applicable. But I learned some very interesting things that were useful and essential when I was replacing my windows and wanted to re-insulate the window bays. For what I needed and learned, it was worth every penny."
5,A useful guide,"Good photos and how-to information. A thorough treatment of insulation in the attic, crawl space and walls."
5,Insulate and Weatherize: Expert Advice from Start to Finish,This is the best book and only book you will need on insulating and weatherizing your house. We have gained much insight and valuable information to make our house more energy effcient. The author will also (for a fee) come to your house and evaluate and recommend what you need to do. We cannot say enough about this book.
3,Good But Written 10 Years Ago,"This book will help you understand how your home is effected by moisture, air flows and temperatures and how to take action to make your home more comfortable. Many of the tips are cost effective and will help you prioritize the steps you should take first. In some cases the book is so dated that the information is not good advice anymore. For example, the book promote using compact floresent lights when currently leds would be the best recommendation. All in all, I got my moneys worth out of this book, but I'd like to see it updated."
5,Valuable information,Especially valuable because of its treatment of XPS and the concept of the air barrier. Definitely worth reading.
4,Be Careful Not to Over fill - Love it!,"I received this hummingbird feeder for Mother's Day and was extremely disappointed when I filled it up and it leaked like a sieve around the silver rim. We returned it to Amazon and they sent a replacement which was obviously a slightly different model since it was colored and no longer had the 'silver' rim....it worked fantastic until I refilled it to the brim.....and then I noticed it leaking again...My mom was reading the instructions and even though it specifies that it holds 6 ounces, it does not warn you to only put that amount into it.....the key is to only put 6 ounces into the feeder. It will hold more but if you place more into it, it leaks...I have had no problem when I measure out 6 ounces. It is easy to hang and I have swarms of hummingbirds in the morning and at sunset to enjoy. We enjoy it so much, that I am going to get another for my father-in-law for Father's Day."
1,My hummingbirds HATE the new design,"My hummingbirds have been enjoying Droll Yankees window feeders for many years. These stick right on the window, so I have gotten some unbelievable pictures of the little guys. Unfortunately, Droll Yankees has radically changed the design. The new feeder only has three parts (not counting the suction mechanism) compared to ten parts on the old feeder. Therefore, it is much cheaper for them to manufacture while keeping the price the same. I have four of the old feeders and one of the new ones on one window. The birds won't touch the new feeder unless the others are all empty and they are desperate. They have a difficult time perching on the new rim, where they have no trouble perching on the old one. I think the new design must have been tested on the smaller east coast hummingbirds - the larger Anna's can't perch on it well at all. Very, very disappointing."
3,Can the Hummers get to the nectar?,Had a little trouble hooking the feeder on the bracket. The flowers don't reach into the solution unless it is almost completely full. It's hard to carry without spilling it when it is this full. Don't know if it is suppose to be like this. I haven't seen any humming birds feeding yet so I don't know if it works. I've been trying it for a couple of weeks now. Will give it a break and then try again later. I do like the way it looks. It adheres to the window very well.
1,Leaks Leaks Leaks,"I was so excited to find this feeder...filled it, attached to my window, and within an hour all the liquid had leaked out. I checked it, made sure everything was tightly fitted...but it continued to leak. So not only do I have an empty feeder, but also a window dripping with red hummingbird goo."
3,Good...but way too fragile,"I think I'm on my fourth one of these! If you ever drop it, it tends to snap, shatter, or leak. It's just too fragile for something that's supposed to be kept outside. I wish it was made of the same plastic as plastic cups but it's thinner and more brittle.Also, despite the ant guards, the feeder fills up with ants."
5,Great Little Book,"The book was bought for a friend who wanted to borrow ours. We didn't want to take a chance on loosing our copy. If you are planning a tea, program on tea time, or just as a pleasant read on the subject, this is the book."
3,Miniature Tea Book,"This is a precious, tiny little novelty book on Afternoon Tea. Pretty pictures. Makes a nice gift."
1,It is 2 inches by 2 inches big???!!!!,"When I received this book I thought what the ??!! is this. It is a teeny tiny book, hard to read, hard to turn the pages. I feel like I got taken."
4,A sequel almost as good as the original,"This movie starts in England with Mr. Thackery retiring. They bring back some of the kids, now adults for cameo appearances including Lulu and the song ""To Sir With Love"". They also show a few scenes from the original movie which is a nice touch. Then he returns to Chicago to teach in an inner city school. He was hired for an honors class but decides to take a class of troublemakers. The movie does a good job of updating the movie to the United States and current problems. If you liked the original you would probably like this movie."
5,Sidney Poitier,"As usual this great American icon came through with a fabulous performance. Mr Thackeray was in rare form and never waivered in his quest to bring excellence to the classroom. A wonderful movie, well worth watching."
2,Not for serious herb growers,"I found this to be totally phony.A fast-talking man reads from a teleprompter, giving ""secret formulas"" for growing herbs. He ""teaches"" us about using ""Murphy's Oil Soap"" and other brand-name chemicals in our gardens. Oh how clever! And you can use instant tea for this and ammonia for that. Why? It's magic!I learned nothing. It's all gimmicry. He shows no respect for herbs - indeed I rather doubt that he has ever planted an herb garden in his life. He shows no respect for the soil - indeed his soil is dead. Shame on PBS for being in any way affiliated with this vapid production."
5,THE BEST!,"I recently purchased this used book from Amazon. It is the best boxing/punching book out there, bar none."
4,Pentax Option M30,"I used to have a Canon, lost it, and got this Optio. Part of the reason I chose a Pentax is because I have a Pentax 35mm from 1982 and it's indestructible! I use my camera for shooting my art to make jpegs, shooting reference, as well as the usual snapshots. I also use it to shoot stuff for Ebay. So far this camera is excellent. Very easy to use which is what I wanted, I didnt need all the bells and whistles. The big viewscreen is great and all the options like flash selection and especially the selections for what type of shot you;re doing are clear and easy. It's also very light. I havent used it in crowd shots yet so I can't attest to the face/focus features they promote. I've had a little bit of shake when shooting some stills for Ebay, but not nearly as much as I did with the Canon. I've had the Optio for a few weeks, and I would defintitely recommend it for the novice as well as the experienced user."
4,Great in its class - super compact cutie type,"Pro:1. easy of use, no need for the manual. all functions logically laid out in the menu system. easy to navigate. very user friendly!2. shake reduction function. very helpful.3. good looking and small size, at a very attractive price.Neutral:nothing really stand out in its performance.Con:1. horrible IQ after ISO 400+ due to excessive, similar to Panasoic slim cams. Be careful doing low light shooting.2. AF is relatively reliable. So is AE. Better than my experience with Kodak, but not as good as Canon.3. I'd say overall the lens is not as sharp as those I found on Canon/Kodak of similar class.Bottom line: a very attractive and affordable ultra slim point-n-shoot good for outdoor normal light shooting. Use caution for indoor shots. Again, I have yet to find a slim cam that can do indoor shots well."
5,Pentax does it again!,"My 55-year-old husband, who for 40 years has taken only slides rather than print photos, purchased this camera in March 2007. He loves it so much that we purcahsed the identical camera for our son's 30th birthday this September. Our son has been using the camera for more than a month now, and he is as enthusiastic as my husband. The camera takes terrific low light shots and it organizes photographs with an easy-to-use calendar. We'd recommend it to anyone considering a digital camera.Pentax Optio M30 7.1MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom"
4,"This is my ""BABY!""","Ever since I ordered this camera last year I've had more joy than I could imagine. Anything and everything can be done with this from video, audio, and of course, pictures. I always have it handy in my pocket and I've captured so many aspects with it. I truly love it.With just a ONE GB SD memory card, you can take up to 5,000 pictures, 30 minutes of video, and 24 hours of audio. WOW! There are different simple settings--most with a brief description of what effects it gives. This camera is so simple. SO VERY SIMPLE.I have ONE dislike about this great camera:It uploads the videos in QuickTime and I have a Windows based computer and I cannot upload it to my Windows Movie Maker.Otherwise, I'm getting a bigger memory card so I can have MORE fun with it!"
4,PENTAX OPTIO M30,"I'VE HAD THIS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND LOVE IT. I GOT MY WIFE A CANON SD1000 AND FOUND THE MENU ON THE PENTAX EASIER TO NAVIGATE. TAKES GREAT PICTURES. ALOT OF PICTURE OPTIONS. BE SURE TO GET THE CORRECT SD CARD FOR RAPID SHOOTING. LOW LIGHT IS ALWAYS A PROMLEM WITH ANY DIGITAL CAMERA OR AT LEAST IN THIS PRICE RANGE MAYBE. NICE LOOKING CAMERA. RECOMMEND FOR EASE OF USE, PICTURE QUALITY, FEATURES AND PRICE."
2,Slow on the trigger,"This camera recently broke due to a fall down some stairs and I felt relieved that I could justify buying something else. It took good pictures, but the lag time between pressing the button and the shutter firing was horrible. Getting any kind of action shot was impossible."
3,anyone else's battery go bad on them?,"I got this camera about 5 months ago and just recently the battery won't hold the charge, anyone else have this problem? Prior to that it's been a great camera, besides not having a cradle to charge the whole camera (you have to take the battery out and place in battery charger)."
2,It will loose all of your pictures!!!,I really loved this camera when I bought it earlier this year until it totally lost all my pictures by doing something to the SD card. Be carefull with this one because it did ths to me repeatedly with different SD card sizes and brands. Its too bad but I lost some spectactular shts on a once in a lifetime trip because of this.
3,"cd new, the box however ...","Received the cd box as planned, two cd's look brandnew the box however appears to be used."
4,Great way to read the Globe!,"I purchased my Kindle and subscribed to the Boston Globe a month ago. Since then, I've found this way of reading newspapers very easy. The options of going by section or article to article is very intuitive and easy to use. It took me all of one minute to get to know how to browse a newspaper. I love it and will use it for many years!"
1,Price Hike?,"A 50% price increase on 12/9 is ridiculous. Sure it's still cheaper than a paper subscription, but this is too much. I have a 6 month grace period and don't plan on continuing my subscription. I will instead read the articles online."
1,Pretty much worthless,"No decent index, no comics. Might as well go to the Globe's free web site, instead."
1,BAD,this is not a good paper.My kids who love comics were made because it has NO comics.Iwould by it only if the paper was my best friend.
3,One at a time?,"I would love to see an option to buy just today's issue. I don't read the paper every day, and some days I choose to read it in print, others on-line. Why can't I just buy today's paper for a small mark-up on what it would cost on the street? Wouldn't that be easy to offer, save paper, and be more convenient for your customers?"
2,"Great for vacation, otherwise disapointing","Great for travel,,wonderful for the beach. Unfortunately way too much is missing. Obituaries, stocks, tv listing movie ratings, Globe west section, pictures, ads , etc. just way too little content. I will try again in the summer, since it is the way to go for outdoor reading. Please improve it and give us the ENTIRE Globe. Would also like it for the Ipad. It is the future, it just isn`t there yet."
1,EXPENSIVE,"The price is expensive for the content included. Although I am continuing my subscription, I don't feel like I am receiving the value for the price paid. At the most, $5.00/month is more in-line with the value received."
2,New Cost Increase Unjustified,"I have subscribed to the Boston Globe Kindle edition since 2007. While it lacked box scores and weather reports to name just a few lacking features I stuck with it figuring that sooner or later they would improve the offering. It seems that has finally happened, but at a 50% increase in cost from ($9.99 per month to $14.99 per month this is simply not worth it."
1,"No box scores?! For the price it should have box scores, I get those for free on Boston.com","No box scores?! For the price it should have box scores, I get those for free on Boston.comNo wonder the Globe is financially unstable, they're not very savvy, and this is one more example.Why pay 9.99 monthly if I can get more content on their free website?Wicked disappointed. I'd happily pay if they provided more content, until then I'm forced to be a freeloader."
2,where are they going,The Globe is getting more like theHearld with it's emphasis on sensationalism.It seems to be engaging in muckraking. It seems to find corruption where it does not exist.It is not like 1935-1960 where corruption existed and they coulnot findit
2,Not the Same,This is not the same as the paper version. I would like to see local sections in this online version.
3,Boston Globe Kindle App needs work,"I like it well enough. It is quick to load and easy to find articles.However.Jumping to the next article brings the headline to the top of the page (good)Continuing to the next article leaves the headline wherever the current article leaves off (bad)The text is full of hyphens that do not belong.There are arbitrary hyphens between or at the beginnings of complete words and (more or less) where they may have been hyphenated in the print edition, but are not needed in the App display.like -this and a -gain - -like this. If you -know what I - mean.Annoying and dif -ficult to --read."
1,Same old Boston Globe,"Don't waste your money. No pictures, comics, sports schedules - in other words the only stuff worthwhile reading in this ultra left-wing pile of crap is not included. The only good thing is that no trees were sacrificed and thus the Globe reduced it's carbon footprint."
2,Doesn't compare with NYT,I found this paper not much good for folks out of the Globe's area. The headlines were local news most of the time.Articles today were articles in yesterday's New York Times. Not very current.No pictures.Mostly local sports. College basketball not even covered most of the time.I found most of the other newspapers offered for the Kindle better.The formatting is OK.
2,Not What I Expected,"The Boston GlobeIf you're looking for the real Boston Globe, unfortunately you won't get it here. The Boston Globe is my local newspaper, so I want the local news and reporting, not just the major articles. I'm used to seeing local high school sport information, box scores, etc in the sports section. Unfortunately you only get a few parts and pieces of the newspaper. Thanks, but that's not offering me any real value. If you ever change to offering the real newspaper, then I may be interested in subscribing."
1,50% price hike? Bye bye!,"The Globe on Kindle, minus sports scores, comics, television etc. was priced perfectly at about $10/month. I was a loyal subscriber but this price hike is ludicrous and poor judgement on their part. The Financial Times & New York Times, while overpriced, at least had additional redeeming qualities to justify being a bit pricier than the Globe. Now that the Globe has gone to $15.00/month they can kiss my subscription goodbye. Too bad."
1,Missing Articles,I ordered the Globe to be able to read the New England section -- it doesn't exist. I live in Maine and this section is the only reason I would get it.
1,Not Yet,"I was hoping to be able to discontinue my paper delivery, but:No G section, and most of all, NO COMICS!When it's complete, I'll reconsider. Meanwhile, if I want to go paperless, I can always use the Globe Reader."
2,poor use of kindle,"the globe puts up healines but no details so you must open the link to decide whether to read. the nytimes, by contrast , puts an intro paragraph. also, where are the comics and the pictures?"
2,No support for iPad,I'm not a fan of the Kindle and opted for the iPad instead. I'm very disappointed to learn that you can only get newspaper and magazine subscriptions if you own a Kindle. Providing this service is one key area Amazon can outshine Apple and keep or grow market share since Amazon already has a deep list of titles.
3,Very cool to get via kindle,"Really is great to get my Globe without having to go outside or playing head games with the delivery clown who delivers it. Yes it does need some improvements in missing items and navigation hiderences, but overall its very coolto get the paper this way."
3,Not too bad.,"I am glad I can save money and paper on the kindle version, but The Boston Globe editors could make this more user friendly. For example, when they do movie reviews on Fridays, it doesn't necessarily point at as a review but sometimes seems like just a regular article. If you blink, you miss it."
5,My former Professor was right- Boston Globe is the best!,"I can always find information quickly with the summary page of the ""Globe"" on my 'Kindle'. Then, I can search more detail, if wanted, with the rich reporting!"
4,"good, quality newspaper - Boston Globe","I purchased this issue of the Boston Globe because other newspapers were more expensive. I found that the writing and coverage were of high quality and at a good price. I will buy future issues of this newspaper, for sure."
3,None,"the kindle version needs work. too many silly mistakes. poor proofing and mixed up headlines are two that really bother me. otherwise, still the best show for boston."
2,"""Change"" is right","""Change"" is very fitting for this project from A&V. This husband and wife again offer another cd of inspirational soul and funk, however not as they used to. The vocal quality is not as on the mark as previous projects, this especially noticeable in Veronica. Since belting out ""Better Way"", our Mrs. Petrucci has had a little boy, but sounds as though she didn't keep up with her daily vocal exercises, all the while Angelo keeps tagging along behind. I feel that it's a bit of a let down and does not have the flooring energy that is found in previous projects. However on the brighter side, the duo team up with producer J Moss (Men of Standard, Karen Clark-Sheard, Hezekiah Walker), who at least makes some blazing tracks to give some oomph to the entire project."
4,Change is good!,It may sound like a broken record but this group is great. Their music continues to break new ground and they gain new fans. They cross ethnic and language barriers to make simply good music.
5,A great product,"I purchased this item at the same time I purchased the Flaming RiverFR1001, which is similar. I gave this product to a friend who also has a 6 volt vehicle. The product is handy and easy to use, and the D batteries provide adequate power to get the job done. This is a very useful product, especially if you do not have easy access to the vehicle's battery to power a DC unit."
3,Just ok,"Nice concept but it is not really a kaleidoscope at all. It has flashing lights and music and words but does not come close to being a kaleidoscope. My daughter seems to moderately enjoy it (she's 6 months old), maybe she'll be more into it later."
2,Blue Light,"the one that I recieved has no blue light and since the light is the most interesting part of this toy to my son ... he only gets two of the three colors (he is too young to know how to press 2 at a time to get the other colors; purple, green and orange) If he presses the blue and gets no light... he leaves the toy behind and moves on. So we usually have to leave it on the musical setting and not the color setting."
3,Not my favorite,"The toy is not a kaleidoscope. Its actually a little boring for my 9 month old...partly because she doesn't get the part where you have to push the buttons and they don't stand out from the handle so its not intuitive for her to press anywhere...So, long story short...she grabs the handle and it does.....nothing. We have to push the buttons for her. Also, the little mirror thing on the bottom is a waste. I wish the colors flashed on the bottom part too. If I had to do it all over again, I'd choose to spend my toy dollars elsewhere."
1,Not what we expected,"This product is by no means a kaleidoscope which is very disappointing, given the product name. We bought this for our 6 month old for Christmas. He is now seven months old and not any more interested in it today than he was at Christmas. The music is Baby Einstein's old standbys... if you have more than one Baby Einstein product, you will likely not need this one. It's just more of the same... it lights up & plays the same songs as the other Einstein products. Our son much prefers the hand held ""radio"" by Baby Einstein."
3,A Little Overwhelming,"I liked the concept of this toy (that it teaches babies colors, and how they combine), but its execution, not so much. My baby loves to stare at lights, so I thought he would enjoy this toy, but he actually finds this quite overwhelming (at five months). Perhaps he will enjoy it more later, but for now, he will not look at it for more than 30 seconds before he starts crying, and will not stop until we turn it off. I think it may be a little too intense for him right now since the colors flash very brightly and very quickly."
3,Not what I expected.,"Nice sturdy toy, but did not hold the baby's attention for long. I expected more from Baby Einstein toys. It was ok, but nothing to write home about."
3,Kaleidoscope,"We bought this for our daugher when she was a few months old since she loved to watch lights and colors. It also seemed like a toy she could work herself somewhat. The toy is listed as appropriate for 3+ months but she didn't use it (without Mommy or Daddy pressing the buttons) until about 6 months or better for a couple reasons. The kaleidoscope is heavy - too heavy for a 3-6 month old to lift with any control. Also, the handles are very wide so tiny hands can't grasp and push the button on the inside to activate the music/lights. The buttons on the inside are the same color as the handle so little babies can't tell what to do - there's no contrast. She's 11 months now and after pressing the buttons a few times she's bored and moves on. It's a cute toy but definately needs 6+ months to begin to enjoy it."
1,Not what I thought it was...,If you are looking for something for a young infant that is still exploring. I bought this for my ten month old and she likes the music but she is just too old for it. All it does it says the colors and lights up with different tunes. I thought it was a actual kaleidoscope but it wasn't. I think I wasted my money on this product. Baby Einstein is over rated. If you want a good product buy Fisher Price...never unsatisfied.
1,Total Rip off,Purchased $90.00 worth of Polaroid film to use in a photo guest book for my daughter's wedding and NONE of the film would develop. What a rip off!!
3,Ecstasy of Jibberish,"""Nightmare of Ecstasy"" is the only existing chronicle ofEd Wood, Jr.'s body of cinematic and written work. The problem with it is that the interviews used to tell the story make George W. Bush's oratory skills sound like Shakespeare. In other words, the comments are not very well articulated and thought-out. At times, ""Nightmare of Ecstasy"" reads like a comic book: full of sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts.The book's saving grace is that as a whole it paints a complete picture of Mr. Wood's career and personal life. The writer/director's career is extremely complex and has lots of sidebars, but everything seems to be covered. I just wish someone bothered to write a book about Ed Wood, and not assemble a bunch of jibberish."
5,Best Racing Game Ever!,"Buy this game, it's so realistic & so much fun I love Laguna Seca! The way the bike slides, rides moves & crashes are brilliant hope SBK2002 comes out soon;) I'm sick of Formula One games with the same tracks over & over this is a great substitute."
3,Fun...But really it's a CONSOLE game.,"I was really excited to buy this game because I kept hearing that it was the best motorcycle simulation out there. Ultimately though, games designed for consoles tend to have arcade style game play and options, and this game is no different. Things like bike setup are very limited in their scope and dont produce completely realistic results. All in all the game is fun and engaging with enough difficulty variations and driver aids to get you in and riding right from the start and still prove challenging as your skill increases. I wish there were more options for game play, a better selection of bikes (maybe some street-legal bikes?), with more distinct handling characteristics, and it would be nice to have roads as well as tracks to drive on. Well, it's only a [price] game I guess."
4,Great Game,I usually collect easports computer games to have an easports games collection. One of the games in my list is NHL2001. I picked this because i love ice hockey alot so this could be the best game for me! Other games i had weren't as good as this! The graphics is great and the player detail is highly graphical. The gameplay is also good and the game doesn't run slow a single bit. My advise to you hockey fans is to buy this new hockey pc game!
5,Like sitting at a game,"This game is definely the most realistic hockey game ever. If you don`t belive me consider this. I have had Ice-level season tickets to the Redwings for three years and I can`t tell a diference between being in the arena and being at home playing on my computer.(ok maybe a little bit!), but still this game is a must buy for all hockey fans hardcore or not."
2,Causes problems with operating system,This looks like a fun game. We have never really been able to play it. We run on Windows 98 and this game causes the system to crash on a consistent basis. EA has obviously had this problem reported frequently but they do not have a suitable fix.
5,a really tight game!,"I went to a friends house once played NHL 2000 and bought myself NHL 2001. I became engrossed, this game is nonstop action!"
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE...worst ive ever seen by EA,"i agree with the person (forget who) who gave this game only one star. its impossible to play more than 5 min. due to its constant crashing back to the desktop while playing. if u dont believe me, just go to the homepage for this game and see hwo many ppl r askin tech support to help them since the game keeps crashes. anyone who says they can play fine without problems r liars. dis game stinks becuz its impossible to do anything with it....a pure waste of money...."

4,Another enjoyable book by Jane Candia Coleman,"I have found that Jane Candia Coleman is one of my favorite authors. She has not disappointed me with ""I, Pearl Hart."" I have recently acquired more of her books, but as of yet, I have not had the time to read them. I am looking forward to them very much. I have just finished ""Pearl Hart"" and enjoyed it very much. However, my favorite book by Jane Candia Coleman is ""Doc Holliday's Woman"". She writes of times that I find very interesting and fascinating. I just wish I had more time to read.Hopefully, I will start ""Stories from Mesa Country"" next week or so."
2,very weak attempt,"This is probably the weakest of the surviving Murnau films; after watching this one, its very evident as to why he didn't try comedies again. Lots of characters, very difficult to keep track of who is who and who is supposed to be doing what. And what was supposed to be funny in most cases just wasn't. Fortunately its a very short film at less than 80 minutes; by that time you will be ready for the film to end. The only extra on the dvd is a commentary, obviously Kino didn't want to put a lot of money into this one. If you are looking for an introduction to Murnau's films, don't try this one first, but instead watch his classics such as Nosferatu, Faust, or The Last Laugh."
5,Looks appropriate with almost anything,"This watch has a good, solid look to it, is very comfortable, and works with everything except very dressy evening wear."
3,"An acceptable introduction to mySAP.com, but light on detail","Sorry, but this is more an SAP advertisement for why you should consider mySAP.com, than a reference on what it is. In fairness, the various industry solutions are reasonably well explained, and so is how mySAP.com addresses those industries. But it's really about the level of depth and detail, which is not much in this case. For example, at the end of each chapter, a case study is provided. These, however, are generally a bit vague and ""marketing-sounding"", while the name of the company or client is often omitted, affecting credibility.Granted, the whole subject is extensive, however, I was expecting more. It doesn't help that this is a translation from German, which tends to make the reading a bit ""stiff"" and academic compared to what we are accustomed to in North America."
3,Good Variation,"This set is nice but nothing extrodinary. It is not on par with the best of Cafe Del Mar or some of the other Ibiza stuff, but it is not bad. I am not into dance/trance techno-beat and this one is not overly inundated with it."
1,"Lost, confusing piece of film","I purchased this based on the amazing reviews...I should have asked around a bit more. I think this suffers from that 'art house' group who think that anything that is 'out there' or simply different means it is better.My family (wife, 12 and 7 year olds) absolutely hated me for making them suffer through this, and in fact it has become a running joke whenever I pick a film ""not another Mirrormask is it dad?""The film was interesting looking, and if that was the only aim, it was a successes. Other than that it is confusing, bizarre, at times even painful film of work."
2,The packaging was broken,"The disk hub had been torn off and the dvd was full of marks. I didnt se any signs of the marks when I wached the movie, but i was kind of pist when I got the package. I dont like paying for damaged stuff."
1,Unwatchable,"I only lasted through the first half hour of this movie before I gave up on it entirely. I loved Neil Gaiman'sAnansi Boys, but it doesn't look like he was too involved with Mirrormask.All of the characters, including the lead, are annoying. This combined with terrible special effects gave me no reason to watch any more. This film is obviously geared toward kids, which is fine by me, but it's a shame that it looks like such little effort was put into it. Neil Gaiman's writing deserves so much more."
3,Very creative but...,"I liked this movie for the obvious special effects and the wierdness about it. It really didn't have a story that made much sense or you could follow very close. At times, you didn't know if the girl was in a dream or was she in reality. Yes, she was stressed about her mother undergoing a major surgery and she didn't like working in the circus, but at least have a ""line of thought"" about a story when the film was being written. The one thing that this movie did follow very closely was the ""Alice in Wonderland effect"". She did step into an alternate reality which did have struggles of it's own."
4,Where art & dreams merge,What a wonderful visual treat! The opening credits set the feel of the rest of the movie as do the costumes and intersting masks worn by the cast. The movie slows 3/4 of the way thru but there are visual surprises around every corner to delight and keep you focused.
3,"Visually entrancing, but flat, derivative plot","I love the comic book work that Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean have done together. I think that Mr Punch is one of the best things I've read. So naturally I was interested in Mirrormask.Well... It looks gorgeous, much of the time, but it's really a Labyrinth rehash. Almost every single plot point was in Labyrinth too. In addition, many of the jokes fall flat. And what sinks the film for me is that there's no sense of urgency; McKean's direction seems to have been focused on what looks good so much that it's detached from its characters. The actors do an adequate job, but the film doesn't seem interested in them.The DVD's nicely produced, though, and the extras are definitely interesting. Still, I can't really recommend this, except to big fans of the two."
3,Interesting movie,"This movie is, like others have said, visually stunning. The plot is very simple, and yeah, it would have been nice if it was more developed, but it was beautiful to watch. The story is a bit like Alice in Wonderland or Spirited Away (Which by the way is a fantastic film itself) in that the heroine experiences a journey into a kind of dream or spirit world, which provides them a kind of self discovery. The real story is underneath all the creatures and mysterious scenery, and is about the young whiny girl who become a stronger and more confident in herself. An adult.The one thing I will say, is that if I had seen this movie as a kid, it probably would have scared the pants off me. The imagery can be a little 'scary' and I would not recommend it for children under 10, even though it is a pg13 movie. Othwerise, you may like it. Think of it as watching a comic book come to life. If you like Neil Gaimen's art, you will appreciate the effects."
2,too off the wall,The concept sounded great and maybe they achieved what they set out to in creating this story. Because it felt like a very strange dream. It was too abstract and off the wall. It is no comparison to Labrynth.
3,Beautiful Imagery - Dull Story,"Watching Mirror Mask I was continually stunned by the imaginative imagery. Floating giants, monkey birds, a wicked queen and evil undulating tendrils are only a few of the marvels to be seen. The film is just jam packed with other-worldly images and creatures. It has a look unlike anything you've seen before. For that alone Mirror Mask deserves high praise.However, the story and (to a lesser extent) characters are shallow and not fleshed out. At the core of Mirror Mask is the relationship between a mother and a daughter, a relationship that I never fully understood or believed. The emotions and situations of the characters were glossed over in order to give more screen time to the amazing visuals.It's sad really becuase many will never make it through the full film since it is so cold and therefore miss out on some of the most amazing imagery from a movie in decades. With just a little more attention paid to the story and characters this could have been a masterpiece."
4,Haunting and riveting... what just went on?,"This is not, in any way, shape, form, or mirror, a ""normal"" movie. It is an explosion of creative energy in acting, costumes, set design, and animation. This is the first movie I've seen where I would suggest that every person that watches this movie ends up with a unique perspective of what they just saw. This movie is about relationships, desires, wishes, concerns, friendships, art, perspectives, and villians.The most similar movie I can think of, in terms of how it makes you FEEL, is Fantasia, and it is not even that close to Mirrormask. How about Narnia meets Fantasia in the land of The Dark Crystal? My suggestion, for those of you who liked Mirrormask, is to now see Spirited Away, directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Like Fantasia, and Spirited Away, you will see and feel something different every time you see these movies.Did I like it? I think my skin is still tingling."
5,Absolutely beautiful,"I remember when I heard that Henson productions was coming out with something else I got a little worried. How could they follow up Labyrinth? The Dark Crystal? The Storyteller? Not to worry. While this film doesn't resemble those other films, it is unique and captivating. They manage to create another new world. It's based on the art of Dave McKean and I was worried about that as well as his print stuff is incredible but I didn't know how it would work in 3-D. It works great. I felt like I was watching something *new*. I highly recommed it."
5,What a cool film...,"I love Neil Gaiman so I rented this movie. It was brilliant. The artistry was amazing & I loved the story. I could really relate to it. Stephanie Leonidas, who played Helena, was fabulous; she's a lovely girl & I hope we see more of her. I 'm no good at reviewing so I don't really know what to say. I just loved the characters & was completely entranced w/ the set."
4,Great Movie,Great movie to watch with the whole family. Fantastically creative and excitingly imaginative! I loved it just as much as my kids.
4,eerily interesting,"This movie is really interesting and strange but what else would you expect from neil gaiman? The creatures are really fun and scary at times, expect to see floating giants and kitties with man faces! It has a really sweet plot and keeps you staring to not miss a scene so you can follow. I'm a huge fan of the creators so if you are too then you should check it out! thanks to Amazon for having this because I couldn't find it anywhere in stores!"
5,Unique Look and Feel,"I loved Mirrormask, which is a coming of age story for the young heroine, wrapped in extraordinary fantasy art. Masks abound, both in the ""real"" circus world and the dream world that Helena journeys in. The artwork is really surreal and unique. I've not seen anything quite like it before and it creates an air of mystery that is very compelling. Helena struggles with her emerging adult feelings, in particular the conflict between the need to start finding her own way and her love for and need to obey her parents - a universal theme. The British accents are a little difficult for my American ears to understand sometimes, but the movie is carried as much by the visuals as the dialogue and I never felt lost. If you want to see more just Google Mirrormask images to get an idea of the atmosphere the movie creates. Highly recommended."
2,Disapointed,"I don't know if I should have read the book first, or if this movie just was not my cup of tea. I fell asleep trying to watch this movie. Needless to say, it didn't keep my attention."
1,Henson co. produces trash now,"unbearable. This film has a Weak plot and tries to compensate with aesthetics and eclecticism. Jim's daughters produce trash. Under their watch, and with more releases like this, the Henson co. will never be relevant again. it's a shame really."
3,visual magic that doesn't quite work as a story,"The images in this are stunning: surreal, fluid, and ominously vivid. However, at least for me, it did not quite hang together as a story: I was not taken in and able to forget that I was watching something that someone made up. Moreover, the acting is uneven: while Helena is quite good if somewhat raw as a talent, the mother appeared stiff to me and unable to conjure up either environment or mood. This is a very personal, of course, so I do not mean to imply that the film would be as flat and incomprehensible to others.I got this for my kids, and they refused to watch it out of disinterest."
3,Not Bad,"I like all things Neil Gaiman, but didn't read this one before seeing the movie. Usually movies never live up to the book. This was not a bad movie, I just think it could have been better with a different Director or Actors, or maybe a bigger budget? the story is great."
4,"Excellent, surreal, and original fairy tale","Mirrormask plunges the viewer into a uniquely surreal world where the unexpected flies from the screen moment after moment. The strange images and photography tricks may wear on some viewers, but overall, this is a fascinating and new fantasy world the film-makers have created. My daughter and her friends (teenagers in 14-15 age range) especially seem to enjoy it, so this film may make for a good gift for that age range."
3,It Starts With the Script,"I bought the DVD based on the trailor and my extreme fondness for Gaiman and McKean's work on Sandman. Having revolutionized the comic book medium, I was certain this collaboration would result in a movie that would kill. While the film is very visually creative, I was disappointed with the writing and this was a shock. Gaiman's Sandman stands as some of the best fantasy writing in the last century, it deserves mention in the same breath with Tolkien. Instead, you get a script that is more in The Dark Crystal league, another movie that I thought was visually more compelling than its story. I'm still looking forward to Stardust, the movie currently being filmed from Gaiman's novel of the same name. I can recommend Mirrormask to fantasy fans based on the wonderful art direction (McKean is an extraordinarily talented artist) and special effects, but don't expect anything remotely as profound as the Sandman or American Gods."
5,Mirrormask is out there.,I enjoyed this movie and it was a good source of entertainment on my latest trip. It is kind of creepy and out there but that is so my style. Mirrormask is about a girl who is unhappy with her world and then has to fight for it when she is replaced in it.
3,Fantasy that's not for everyone,"I have to admit I was intrigued at times. I personally thought much of the graphics was ugly. It made me think of Tim Burton's work The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride. Beetlejuice came to mind too. I think partly because the main character (played by Stephanie Leonidas) reminded me of Winona Ryder. The plot made me think of Alice In Wonderland. Plus tales aimed primarily at girls like Sleeping Beauty.I felt the story was about growing up. For example the line ""You can't handle real life"". But perhaps I'm reading too much into this fantasy.Most people will not be feeling like myself, ambivalent. I think viewers will either love it or hate it."
2,Rent it before you buy it.,"This movie was so terrible that I really don't know where to begin. I'm giving it a 2 because the artwork and music were really interesting, but the plot was hard to follow and very bland."
2,"2 pounds of story in a 20-pound box, or a special-effects demo reel?","DO NOT expect the epic quests of ""Dark Crystal"" or ""Labyrinth."" If you weren't told that this came from the same people, you would never guess it.Visually stunning, 45 minutes after pressing Play I was still waiting for the story to start getting interesting. By an hour in, I had given up and was wondering who to give it to. Someone who will appreciate the incredible imagery but not notice the minor little detail that this movie is BOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRING!!!!!There are some excellent sequences, but it seems that the film was done in the ""Now What Oddball Idea Can We Put Here?"" school of cinema. It is disjointed and maundering, and proof that it is possible for a film to be TOO much like real dreams."
3,Problems with the postal service,"Ok, I can't blame the seller too much for this one however, it took almost two weeks before I was scheduled to receive the item. The real problem came when I had not received the movie before I had to move and so since I have a change of address to a new state, I have still yet to receive the item and it is approaching a month. Now like I said I can not blame the seller for myself having to move or for any issues the postal service had, but I am used to receiving my orders within about a week. So take from this what you will..."
3,Where's the insert:??,"I received the item very promptly, but I am confused about something. When the item description says it is brand new and sealed, why is the booklet or insert that comes in new DVDs now inside? I ordered two DVDs from amazon and niether of them came with the insert, but they were stated to be brand new. Other than that I am very pleased with my purchases."
1,Very Visual,I GIVE FIVE STARS!!! NOT ONE! MY MISTAKE!!!I can't help but say that I loved this movie! It was extremely visual and unique. I've seen nothing like this ever before! All I can say is you either hate it or like it. What irritates me is people saying that it was too boring or they couldn't follow it. My 9 year-old cousin understood it and the next day bought the DVD. I just think people aren't open-minded anymore.
2,"Good Visuals, but Overall Dull Story. 19 out of 100.","The visuals kept my interest only long enough to find out that the story was dull. I left halfway through to tap a nap. This movie has all the eggs in one basket.Total Score (out of 100) = 199 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.3 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?4 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?2 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?1 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?"
2,I didn't finish it,"Being a fan of Neil Gaiman's writing, and a lover of fantasy movies, I had high expectations for this film. I thought the asthetic was beautiful, but the plot was flimsy and the dialogue uninteresting. It was beginning to feel like a chore to watch it and I gave up before it was over."
5,Gaimen+McKean= Crazy delicious,"The best advice I can give is not to imbibe in any mind altering chemicals before viewing this film, it is a mind altering chemical in and of itself.Brilliant surreal imagery, a stand up cast and a spin on classic storylines, everything you can expect from Neil Gaimen.If you grew up on films like The Dark Crystal, The Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, Krull, Legend, or any of those amazing 80's dark fantasy movies, this film is for you.If you read Sandman, Neverwhere, American Gods, Stardust or anything by Gaimen, this film is also for you.If you want to try something radically different, then again, this movie is for you.Otherwise, turn away, fold your hands peasant, this is not for you.PS- really, love the cast, can't wait to see more from Jason Berry and Stephanie Leonidas"
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Charmless and ineffective experiment by illustrator Dave McKean and vastly overrated Douglas Adams clone Neil Gaiman. Who is this film for? What is it about? One is never sure. It just goes on and on, toying listlessly with commonly misconcieved 'fairy-tale' elements in ways that have been done better elsewhere, running in circles until it runs out of tropes and abruptly ends. The characters are flat, the writing self conscious and empty and the visuals eye-tiringingly cheesy and monotonous."
4,The incredible visuals carry the somewhat slow plot,"To keep it short and sweet, this is very worth watching if you love eye candy. The fantasy sequences here are truly astonishing at times, and are so colorful and imaginative that they're a treat to watch. Alas, if only the story and acting had done as much for me. I found it pretty slow going, all told, but am duly impressed with the vision presented herein.Allegorical, weird, wild, and yet also somehow a little too ambitious, Mirrormask is certainly worth checking out if you like Henson's firm's imagination enough to put aside story concerns for a couple of hours.Phantasmagorical, plus and minus."
3,good but bad,"visually stunning film, the story is pretty much the Wizard of Oz. There's a sort of empty quality to it, though, which leaves me feeling like I missed something. I bought it, I watch it sometimes, I would say I like it. I would even say, ""watch it"" to pretty much anyone. But don't expect to walk away from this feeling like you've really experienced much of anything. Don't expect to be impressed. It's not going to become your favorite movie or anything."
3,Interesting Visuals,"The cinematography, 3D animation, and special effects were very interesting... great artistic eye candy.story is a bit flat and predictable... it's boringly obvious what all the parallels are in the plot with the main and supporting characters.There were some funny moments, and some interesting dialogue...It's worth adding to the collection of movies that are similar (yet better) to this film (ie. Labrynth, Legend, Dark Crystal, etc.)"
3,"A slightly warped, slightly cracked Wizard of Oz...","So, basically, this is a special effects piece through and through. And a rather bizarre one at that (my first impression was ""Wizard of Oz on LSD""). The imagery is strange, ethereal, slightly jarring at times and occasionally a bit dark (though never frighteningly so).The movie is, in large part (aside from the beginning and end), a dream-world. And, much as dreams often don't make sense, neither does this world when it comes right down to it. As such the plot seems a bit contrived at times with semi-random events happening and semi-random resolutions to situations.While the visuals are sometimes cool and the movie is relatively inventive, somehow the movie still didn't do much for me. I can't really put my finger on it. I guess it was the somewhat jarring and unsettled feeling / mood of the movie that was offputting.The special features are fairly interesting, with some ""making-of"" material, etc."
5,modern classic,"great acting all around; wonderful story. maybe a little to bizarre/creepy for the very young, but i could be wrong. this sits up there on my shelf with 'the princess bride' and 'the adventures of baron munchausen': movies i could watch over and over again and still enjoy."
5,Fantastic Movie,This is honestly one of my favorite movies. The effects are very well done and the story is very original. Buy it! You won't regret it.
5,"Everything you felt, but would never say","I found this book to be one of the greatest tools in mending a broken heart. Every raw emotion felt and every crazy thought that has crossed your mind through love and heart break is described within the pages of this book. I cannot describe how brilliant I believe this book to be, I only applaud Georgie Nickell for having the courage to expose her own heart and pain for us to read and relate to and to say the things more of us with we could express. Reading this book and all of the experiences she takes you through makes you want to light up with her over a vodka tonic with extra lime! Without a doubt any female old or young who has ever loved and lost would fall in love with book at page one."
1,belly of the dragon,"I was disappointed in the story myself. I found the storyline to kind of jumped all over the place and it was a tad on the dry side. I can see non-fiction as possibly being dry, but this is supposedly fiction."
4,It is what it is,The multi tool is pretty solid..it does what its supposed to do.the thing that makes it a bike tool is that it has the chain tool and spoke wrenches.to make it a solid bike tool i do wish it had a wrench big enough to take off my wheels.Besides not being able to take off my wheels with this tool it does seem to work with everything else on the bike
5,"Beautiful, Strong and Compact","This tool has everything that you really need and is really compact. Its also really well made; no plastic parts.I just keep this, a spare tube (Q-Tubes) and a couple of CO2 inflator, in my bike pack.By the way, you don't really need tire levers if you have quick release skewers because you can take out the skewer and use the lever as the tire lever."
4,perfect package,Has all of the essential tools in single slim package so there is no chance of misplacing one of the tools.
2,"If you like puzzles, this is the tool for you","Hey, unless you don't mind a tool that falls to pieces due to vibration on a long ride, and you enjoy hunting down little washers and stray parts in the bottom of your tool bag and spending more time putting your TOOL back together than you do actually working on your bike, you might want to consider looking for a more ""low-maintenance"" tool. What a joke!"
2,folds unexpectedly,"Crank Bros 17 multi-tool, and probably most like it, folds unexpectedly. The tools do not lock at all in any position. When you apply downward pressure, the offset of the tool from the handle causes the tool to collapse back to the handle."
3,cool but too fragile,After displaying it in my entertainment center for a month it finally broke when I took it down to change its position. I guess I needed to be a little more careful handling the plastic legs since one of them snapped when I tried to straighten it out. But it is harder to be careful with frail plastic parts when your only one handed! Despite what happened I'm saving to buy another one! I guess I just loved how its chome parts sparkled in sun light and made it look so majestic.
1,sad at christmas,We purchased this for our six year old son for christmas. We were very impressed with the die cast body but the plastic legs are made horribly. My husband put voltron together for our son. While holding it the leg while loose fell off and snapped the joint. Our son did not play rough with it. He did not even get to enjoy his gift. I feel that the lable as a die cast action figure is misleading since only the center of the body is metal the rest is cheap plastic. This is the first time we have had an issue with a product through amazon and I sincerely hope they will contact us to rectify this.Angela Mc Guinness
2,mediocre,"Basically this is the same game as last year's Madden with newer rosters, but still not completely up to date. Slightly better graphics, but there seem to be some bugs like: on punt returns the AI for your blockers getting in front of you is TERRIBLE...occational problems when saving/loading a game...kicking a FG/PAT takes WAY too long for the kicker to get set up...the franchise mode isin't as nice as last years game (not as easy to navigate, still haven't found out how to sign free agents mid-season). In the end, if you're a die hard fan like me you'll enjoy the game (once EA fixes the bugs), otherwise look elsewhere."
2,Gimme A BREAK!!!,the gameplay of this game is horrible.if the computer is losing by the beginning of the last quarter then they just start to magically catch anything that comes their way even if you tip the pass.the blockers are constantly missing thier blocks.the recievers hardly ever catch a pass unless they are wide open and sometimes even then they drop the ball.running the ballc an be hard at times to because the defense can dive so far away.the graphics of this game are fairly adequate but i think they could be better.
5,Madden is the greatest,"Madden football has always been the best of all football games, for any gaming console, and this installment just extends that lead. They've finally downplayed the ability of the juke, which kind of saddens me, because it was so much fun burning the computer with the juke move."
4,Perfect Game,This a good allround football game. You can get tired of it after a while but if you go play another one of you games and then come back to it in a week or two it will seem like a new game.
3,A little weak on content.,"Maybe I was jaded by the content of NHL 2001. The depth of the play by play.Madden lacks in this department, I was hearing John say the same things by the second half of the first game. In contrast, NHL 2001, I'm in my seventh season, and still hearing things I haddn't before.The gameplay of Madden makes up for this, however. Sticking with what has worked for the past 10 years, its become the standard. Motion is fluid, Graphics are good, play choices are excellent. I can do without the coach commentary for offside calls, but AI is ok.If you are looking for football for the PC platform, it really is the standard. If only they had a little competition to push them to greatness."
4,"great game, just a couple of things","This is in fact a better game than the 2000, much better graphics, sounds and interface. The gameplay is much like last years. I see that some of the other reviews are posted by people who haven't even played the game. Something bothers me, it's very hard to beat the AI, they (AI) abuse the pass. Even the TB Bucks use pass playes some 80% of the time. I've enjoyed playing against a friend much more than playing single player. I like the game overall, but the passing thing needs a fix."
2,Repetitive Crashes Make Game a Bust,"No amount of neat graphics can overcome the frustration of the game throwing you out with 2 minutes left in the half. The tech support did me no good also. You might have a machine that has no problems with it, but then again you might not. I surrendered to the crashes and mailed the game back to EA Sports asking for my money back."
5,Wonderful,The entire CD was great. I love listening to it to relax or as background when we have others over
3,The court scene was priceless!,"the court scene was priceless, two humps and a swirl, come on, you know that was funny!"
4,FUNNY AS *&^$,"This Movie was extremely funny. If you grew up around or are familiar with hood life you will find a great majority of the movie entertaining and funny as you can relate probably. Even if you didn't, you should watch, you may find it even more entertaining. Thats been my experience with sharing it with a variety of people I know. I REALLY recommend this movie. I don't think it got all the attention it deserved!!!!"
1,"Row, row, row your boat...","SOUNDS OF NATURE: AT THE LAKE is supposed to be an environmental recording of ambient lake sounds designed for relaxation. Unfortunately, the recording is spoiled by the unnecessary manmade sounds of someone rowing a boat---recorded from inside the boat with its hollow echoing sound---so that the calm and natural lake sounds are interrupted by the bumping and sliding of aluminum oars and the sound of disturbed water, and lastly, the sound of the oarsman coming to dock and clumping away from the microphone. Since the sound loop is only about 5 minutes long and the disc is an hour we get treated to this disruption repeatedly. While it's not an outboard motor, there's just no reason it had to be included in a ""Sounds of Nature"" CD.There are undoubtedly better environmental CDs available."
2,"2 Years, Over & Out","We purchased our second Fellowes paper shredder, a model P600C-2 after our previous paper shredder motor gave out.The P600C-2 was ideal in size for a home office. We usually do not shred more than receipts and mail with our personal information and an occasional credit card.This unit came with a 2 year warranty so of course, we got a little over two years worth of use before the mechanics inside destroyed themselves.I just purchased my third (and last) Fellowes product, a SB-99Ci. I hope the new unit does not disappoint the way this one has.Three strikes against this company and I will call them out and just use my BBQ grill."
2,"okay, but gears broke after 2-3 yrs normal use","I've generally been happy with this shredder. Unfortunately, this shredder, like my last Fellowes shredder, broke under normal use (7 or less sheets per grind). The problem appears to be the plastic gears that drive the shredder bars.Unless Fellowes changes the composition of their plastic gears to a more durable metal, or metal-strength plastic, I would look for another shredder."
1,FELLOWES P600C-2 SHREDDERS,"I HAVE DONE A LOT OF ODERING FROW ON LINE, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE THAT I HAVE BEEN THIS DISPLEASED ABOUT THE PRODUCT THAT I NEVER RECIEVED, OR NOT BEING ABLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THE 'I,M NEW SELLER.BUT BELIEVE YOU ME,I WILL NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM ( BRYCEBOBBY ) EVER AGAIN AND DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE ELSE TO DO SO EITHER.SINCERELY YOURS A VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER."
5,Dads--this is a great Bible for your parenting time,"This is a great Bible for any Dad to share with the children. It includes a lot of extras, and highlighted passages to teach your children the Gospel....the true meaning of ""discipline""."
5,Great Kirk Hammett Book,"Everything in this book is right. The tab to all his solos is here and spot on with no errors to be seen. It has all his solos from the early albums (Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightining) to the newer albums (Load). Some of the better solos include Seek and Destroy, Fade To Black, One, Blackened, Battery, and Enter Sandman. It also includes an interview with Kirk, his gear setup, photos, and scale diagrams. Along with the solos it also includes some of Kirks licks. This book is not for everyone however, as anyone who has listened to Kirk play knows that his solos are fast and flashy for the most part, and no beginning guitar player will have the skill to play like this yet.Overall this is a great book for the advanced guitar player. If your interested in learning how to solo this book is for you too. It has helped me learn how to craft my own solos, as well as help me gain playing speed."
5,The Art of Kirk Hammett,This book was incredible. The tablature on the solos were 100% accurate. Kirk Hammett is awesome and so is this book.
5,well....,"This is a fine book for diving into the art of Kirk Hammet. Soloing, signature licks, and an interview; they are all there to give you some of meaning of the man, Kirk Hammet.When it comes time for the Metallica fan in all of us to reach out to the music, we get a guitar and lay down our best attempt at doing that. That is where this book will come in handy. Great and renowned solo's monopolize the book. Including a small comment on the solo strait from Kirk and the author.Not really a beginner book, but it was for me, well I would still buy it even if you are a beginner. You will find very much to keep you busy, promise."
4,not what i expected - but not too bad,"Well, I ordered this book thinking there'd be some kind of profound analysis of Hammet's technique, but it just has samples of his solos and a few other history goodies. But considering how little I paid for this book, it was all worth it in the end. I like the commentary more than the music, since I already have the Metallica transcriptions. Its a good buy if you're a huge metallica fan like me."
3,It's ok,"See other reviews, but rest assured, this is not going to make you a sophisticated guitar player... if that's what you're trying to be. (I got the impression that it was the author's intent) You might as well get the songbooks that have the complete songs instead of this solos-only format."
2,Not that great.,"If you love Metallica maybe you'll like this. The only cool part is where they show the fingerings that Hammett uses for scales. Everything else is just mundane tab with a snippet of Hammett saying something like ""When I came up with this lick I felt cool."" Ummmm ok so teach me something bozo I just bought your book."
1,They will overcharge you in your bills,To anyone looking for a wireless service please investigate other customers review for AT&T. Trust me when I say that it is not worth it. The signal is horrible as well as their phones. I find my self having to turn my phone off and back on in order to get people to hear me because when I make or receive a call for some reason they can hear me but I cant hear them and it happens often. Another thing is I barely use my phone since I dont really like talking too much on the phone but still I get this bills for about $100.00 more than what I should be paying and its always a problem that needs to be resolved with client service which is a pain dealing with every month. Save your self the trouble and do a lot of research before making a contract with AT&T cause once your in they wont let you go unless you pay a large amount of money to leave. I might just pay it since they seem like they will charge more on the monthly bill. Good luck to you.
2,The way the future One World Army will look,"Fisas calls for complete disarmament of all countries, except for local police forces; for a standing one world army; for independent sources of financing so the UN isn't dependent on the good will of its members; UN ownership of all military bases in each country; etc. Ought to scare the hell out of anyone who loves their country. If you hate your country, you'll love this book."
4,Good Christmas and family entertainment,"I saw this when it first aired on PBS and enjoyed it very much. There are eight former performers acting as hosts, including the late Myron Floren, and it consists of clips taken from Christmas shows from the series' nearly thirty year run. It includes many clips of the children of former band members performing on the show, and although the picture quality is not of the best (probably due to age), it is just as good as the later program A Lawrence Welk Family Christmas, and unlike most PBS specials, Welk or otherwise, this one is two hours long, rather than the standard 85 or 90 minutes. The only gripe I have, other than the picture quality, is that it is not on DVD. I recommend this tape to Welk fans and all who enjoy clean family holiday entertainment."
5,Perfect Wilson game balls.,My son is a kicker and needed a few balls to practice with. The footballs were delivered promptly and were in great shape.
3,Alright Football,"When I first bought this football it was a little sketchy. The ends are hard as a rock and are extremely pointy. The width is great for all hand sizes, but the laces tend to be slippery. All in all it is an alright football but it has its flaws. I personally would not suggest buying it."
3,Cute but...,"In the 3 weeks since we first put this clock up, it's already lost about 5 minutes. So we'll be happy with it as part of the room decorations (it is very cute) but won't count on it for getting my daughter to school on time."
3,I disappointed,All songs with La Novia not original recording He is the old man long ago I need to purchase original album
5,My Review For Get a Clue,"I loved this movie. It is totally exciting and fun. Turtle and her friends ( and enemies) have to solve a mystery before it is too late. They are paired up and each pair has a set of clues. They must solve the mystery before they run out of time.It is a thrilling and laughable movie which will make you wonder: Who could it be? If you want more fun, try the book: The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin."
2,"Get a Clue, not The Westing Game","This movie is not at all as good as The Westing Game. I bought it for my Reading Class to compare the novel to the movie. All my eighth graders hated it, and I wasn't too keen on it. Simple little things were changed for no good reason and without very good explanation: Why would Angela marry Plum? And therefore, why would he have anything to do with the Westing case? Connections were made that were never explained, and thus the kids ended up more confused than anything. As a movie alone, perhaps it would be okay, but I'm not too keen on this being compared at all to a great novel like The Westing Game."
1,NOT LINDSAY LOHAN,Just for clarification purposes: THIS IS NOT THE 2002 DISNEY CHANNEL ORGINIAL MOVIE WITH LINDSAY LOHAN!!
3,Get a Clue - movie review,I would not recommend this movie because it was slow starting out. I also did not like it because it was very different from the book The Westing Game. I had to watch this movie for a project for school. This is really not my type of movie.
2,Sloppy as all holy heck,"A friend was in this movie...he loaned it to friends...I was one of two to watch it all the way through...good for a laugh, but low quality horror films need more skin---this has none"
3,shears,"Fast shipping , I have used them for several months and have not had to sharpen however the blades do get rust spots quite easily , if not thoroughly dried with a cloth air drying doesn't prevent the rust ."
5,Recital Hispanoamericano de Raphael,Este es un material latinoamericano muy bien hecho por Raphael. Me gustan todas sus canciones. Soy Colombiano y Raphael ha sido uno de los cantantes favoritos para los Colombianos.
5,Stylish and powerful,"Leave the hooey of the previous review aside. He's obviously got a point to make that has nothing to do with music and is wrong extra-musically as well. If it really matters what Karajan's politics were, read Osborne's excellent biography and learn that Karajan had ongoing difficulties with the Nazis culminating in his being frozen out of most work when he married a woman who was half Jewish.All of that aside, these are magnificent readings. Karajan - as the composer himself recognized - has the idiom of this music down perfectly and finds perfect balance between mysticism and cool objectivity in The Swan of Tuonela, for example. If you want this selection of pieces, you won't find a better played or more sympathetically interpreted recording than this one."
2,Tired and Mired,"This recording introduced me to Sibelius and left me underwhelmed. The performance is so sluggish that I wasn't inspired to seek out more music by the composer. The Swan of Tuonela is lush and lovely, but Tapiola drags on at a leaden pace. Valse Triste sounds more like Armchair Depression. It was enlightening when I gotEugene Ormandy Conducts 20th Century Classicsto hear the work conducted as an actual waltz. The sad smile is more touching than Karajan's drudging gloom. Unlike the flock on the cover, this Finlandia never takes flight."
4,Good quality DVD,"I use this most mornings. I really like that there is a section that teaches you, but most importantly, there is a section where you just follow along with the teacher. The great thing is he tells you when to breath in and out; as you get more accustomed to the moves, you don't have to look at the TV as much, because his breathing instructions are a cue re: when to shift position. BTW, he tells you to breath in Chinese, which I find to be less disruptive and more meditative."
3,nice sign,i was disappointed because i thought i had bought something else from a different band but was pleasantly surprised after listening. I really liked the first song and the intro is funny. as a whole though its too disco-ish dj for me. not bad though
2,didn't like,"The songs were a little annoying. My kids liked it, but I couldn't watch it more than a couple of times."
2,I was disappointed. It's mostly just video of babies playing...,"Your child won't learn to identify letters and numbers watching this video. It's mostly just background music and video of babies and toddlers playing on an indoor plain background. Babies and toddlers will probably like looking at the children on the video, but don't expect them to learn anything."
2,"Hey, you could do worse...","I saw it on the shelf at Blockbuster, and being a fan of Ken Shamrock, I figured it's worth my $3 for grins.The director has a charming knack for filling the lulls in action with images of nudity. In fact, of the entire female cast, I can think of only one woman who did not bare her breats at some point in the movie. (Brito's headset-wearing assistant)Plus you get to see Shamrock one-handing an M-16 and using a hand grenade to open a padlock. What could be finer?Two stars because the movie didn't totally suck."
4,"Shamrock's first film ""Champions""","Ken Shamrock of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and now with the WWF is in this. Louis Mandylor who is on the CBS show ""Martial Law"" is also in it. There's a lot of great fight scenes. It's cool that the actors are real fighters doing their own fighting instead of just stunt men. For this kind of movie it's surprisingly good and well written."
3,Kool Keith CAMEO!!,"Champions has a brief cameo by Kool Keith approx. 30 minutes into the movie. His cameo is amusing and lasts about 90 seconds. No rapping but he does quote his own lyrics from ""Poppa Large"". If you're not a huge Kool Keith fan then you can probably give this movie a pass."
4,Shamrock in a movie.,"Ken Shamrock of the WWF and UFC is in this. Louis Mandylor from ""Martial Law"" is in it, too. Decent fight scenes through out. It's cool that both Shamrock and Mandylor do their own fighting instead of being doubled. It's surprisingly good and well written."
3,Great Idea,"A useful summary of the changes over the past 2,000 years, but apparently the telephone was not important enough a development to mention!"
1,Where's the UNEDITED version???,I already own the EDITED version and went to the internet to search for the UNEDITED version. Amazon has the rating for this title as X and they don't show anywhere on the page that it's the Edited version. Very disappointed with this complete waste of money.
4,Good information but production quality low,"Even though has a recent release date, people talking in video look like it was filmed 20 years ago. Aside from that the content was very interesting and informative for my Little Flowers Girls Club"
4,A must for DisneyWorld Fans!,"Have you ever wanted to live in a themepark? As Spider says in the intro, the idea came to him while visiting a famous California theme park. The premise is simple, life is bad enough in the future that one young boy wants to live in a DisneyWorld-type theme park (Dreamworld) where all is good, magic lives and he'll be safe forever. Until something mysterious starts to happen after the park closes.There's a healthy amount of ""gee whiz"" to overcome but Spider does it easily. Be warned, I read this book in about a 3 hour sitting, its pretty short. Consider that when shelling our hardcover dollars. Characters were pretty well fleshed out. This book would be great for young adults also."
3,Hilarious And Thoughtful Little Novel from Spider Robinson,"""The Free Lunch"" isn't the best piece of writing I've seen from Spider Robinson, but it is surely among his funniest, most thoughtful examinations of humanity being affected by technology. I agree with a previous recent reviewer that the writing sounds a bit like Robert Heinlein's typical prose, but to Robinson's credit it is more thoughtful than almost anything Heinlein wrote (The notable exception is ""Stranger in a Strange Land"".). Here Robinson writes of two people trapped in a technological amusement park, trying to cope with a sadistic business tycoon determined to destroy the park. It receives a good recommendation from me as a satisfying, light bit of reading."
4,Living in a dream,"Enjoyed the story very much, but needed a villian to match the protagonist. I felt that the protagonist could outmatch two or three of the villians presented."
2,Heinlein Heir?,"I agree with critics who have compared this book to some of Heinlein's work--it has the same sketchy, ridiculous plotting and totally unbelievable characters as Heinlein's later work. What it doesn't have is any of Heinlein's fascinating, provocative ideas or his genuine wit. In spite of their many flaws, Heinlein's books somehow work; this one doesn't. It reads like a first draft of a so-so idea that wasn't plotted or outlined beforehand: classic sloppy writing. And incidentally, I'm tired of authors writing brilliant ""child"" characters that are really just little adults. A child can be convincingly brilliant--Orson Scott Card anyone? But the outlook of Robinson's child character here is that of a little adult, and not a very smart one at that."
4,Spider Robinson's latest adventure,"Spider Robinson spins another whimsical tale. Like many of Robert Heinlein's juvenile books, Robinson's young hero, Mike, manages feats that adults would find difficult. However Mike and his mentor, Annie are both geniuses (another Heinlein title character trait)so they can manage three impossible things before breakfast. Robinson's Dreamworld is definitely a place I want to visit. Filled with exhibits reflecting Heinlein, Beatles and other cultural icons of the twentith century, the park is a walk down memory lane for baby boomer scifi fans. Read and enjoy, then pass it on to a favorite twelve year old kid and hook him or her on science fiction."
5,All about trees,"Solid intro to basic concepts regarding trees. I occasionally wished Gibbons would have chosen the more scientifically correct term than a common, but less specific word. Includes an identification guide for various trees and shows young naturalists how to make their own tree identification book (pressing leaves, leaf and bark rubbings, and drawings). Karen Woodworth Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
5,Growing up with Cugy's music...,What a joy to reminisce about the music from my past. His music is so alive and just makes you smile. The rhythm makes you want to dance...or at least just move to the beat.
4,Xavier Cugat - Estrellita,A pleasant CUGAT experience featuring the very rare arrangement of the Estrellita Rhumba. Nice.
1,Much worse than season 3.,"Season four of The Lexx is a great disappointment. The planets Fire and Water, which were very interesting in season 3 have been destroyed, and now the Lexx and crew experience ""the little blue planet"" a ""type 13 planet in its end stages"" meaning Earth.There are a few laughs, but the shows in season 4, even with the talents of Bunny and Prince are not very well written and in many cases just plain dumb."
1,Jammed,It is jammed. I do not use it that often and I do not put much in it. However I cannot figure out how to unjam it. It is dead right now. It is less than one nmonth old.
5,An Old Favorite,"My Godmother got me this book for christmas of 1985, and I still love to curl up on the couch on christmas and read it. It tell's a beautiful story with beautiful pictures to help tell the story. This is a great gift for the younger children."
1,The Donkey's Dream,"This book is apparently very Catholic. Apparently the donkey's dreams are symbolic, or to quote the author in the back of the book, 'The Virgin Mary shares certain symbols with the universal ""great mother."" They have been given to her with special care, by tradition. In this book, the donkey dreams of some of them.' My thoughts when reading this book was that the author must have had a bad acid trip in the 60s. So if you're not Catholic, don't buy this book, unless you too had a bad acid trip in the 60s. Too bad I had to buy this book to find this out."
5,A Gift Beyond All Measure,"A donkey sets out on a meditative nighttime journey with an unusual passenger. Catholics and Protestants will love this beautiful, nativity story with its contemplative journey. It makes a wonderful Christmas gift for the Christian family with a preschooler! I purchased this book for my little preschool niece for Christmas. Her mother wrote back that she kept crying at the beauty of the illustrations while reading it to her daughter. The child saw the effect of the book on her mother and kept saying ""Mommy, read it again!"" For Ages 2 - 8.Be sure to buy a hard copy version or library binding so that it will last."
1,Really frustrating - waste of money,A have bought two of these flashlights and both have failed. Both lights started going out intermittently and some of the LEDs went out.
3,LED Flashlight,"These LED flashlights are great when I first get them but the switch doesn't last very long. I've tried several different models and haven't had any luck yet. As far as light output, they're great compared to a regular flashlight."
4,Alot of Light in the Palm of Your Hand,"Knowing not all LED's are created the same and a little suspicious of the great price on this little model, I didn't know what to expect when I ordered three of these flashlights. I wasn't disappointed at all.The unit, even with the three included AAA batteries, is surpisingly light due to its aluminum body. It has a sturdy O-ring in the cap to prevent water damage (though I haven't tested that yet). This little light is far brighter than the old Mag-Lite I'd been using. It has a clear, strong beam of bright white light. It's so compact that I got one for each of our cars and another to hang in the hall closet. A handy carrying case is included and the flashlight has a lanyard. At the price, I don't think you can beat it."
4,Good for the price,"These are nice looking flashlights. I bought 3 of the led flashlights..2 were the 9 light and one was the 21 LED flashlight. For $2.99 AND $5.99 They are good for the price. They work well and are very bright. These are not for distance lighting though. They light up a fair area close up. One flashlight keeps losing its retaining ring...just pops off..but it pops back on easily enough. One other lost its rubber switch cover. You have to keep the ends screwed on tightly to keep the light working. Battery life is excellent.I use one nightly and its lasted for over 8 weeks without changing the batteries. (3 AAA) It fits nicely in a shirt pocket. Have dropped my 21 light led flashlight many times and it still works...all 21 lights, so its pretty rugged.I highly recommend these flashlights...but remember.. there not high quality light.. just good lights."
1,Inadequate Performance,"Disappointing performance. The on/off switch malfunctioned immediately and the light would go out intermittently without warning. It would sometimes re-light if i banged it against a rock. Also, the inner retaining ring that holds the removable battery door together also broke immediately. Poor product even if it was FREE. It let me down on a rough contry camping expedition in South Dakota. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
3,Good Product,"This product constantly surprises me - it's light weight, size and most of all the brilliance of the light. It is not recommended to point this in someones face; it can hurt the eyes! Very useful for mechanics to see in small cramped spaces in the engine bay, useful also for older folks with not so perfect vision. The only problem is that this ""brilliance"" is only for a short distance; if this product could project this powerful beam further, this product would be perfect!"
4,"I love this product, but.....","The item throw a rather bright and disperse light. Perfect for enclosed space, like working inside a computer for example (which is why I bought it). There is one nagging problem (not big, but nagging). There is no way to focus or scatter the light. My Maglite can do this by using a lens in front of the bulb. The lens can be moved foward or back (by a screw effect) to adjust the area of coverage for the light using a screw. I believe that this product can benefit greatly from such a simple innovation. Second recommendation, instead of 3 batteries, make it a 4 AAA design so I can use an entire pack at a time (instead of having to leave 1 cell in the pack)."
1,Very good service for about a dozen operations!,"I was very pleased with the looks, and the operation of this product for about 12 times. After that it started sporadic operation. No rhyme or reason. Sometimes worked, more often did not. Checked and tested batteries, replaced batteries. Still the same hit or miss. Finally it just stopped working."
2,Ok for a stocking stuffer,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer but won't be giving it away because not all 21 lights work, the outer ring lights and center light works but 6 lights on inner 2nd ring don't work, so this is really a 15 light flashlight. For what I paid it isn't worth the hassle of boxing up, driving to UPS and shipping it back. It's just another piece of chinese made junk, wouldn't recommend it if you really need a GOOD flashlight."
1,Terrible quality! Doesn't work!,"I bought two of these flashlights for Christmas. One didn't work straight from the package. The other only worked intermittently before becoming defunct. Not quality construction. The pieces were not bonded together well. I knew from the price that it wouldn't be high quality, but I did expect the flashlights to at least work for a while."
4,Good film,"Good French film, good actors. The story is a funny drama with too many action, like James Bond films."
3,Everybody speaks French in Japan!,A French detective or so came to Japan for a family business but proved being more effective in anti-Mafia (Yakuza) deeds than local professionals.A comedy of murdering demonstrating funny moments of Japanese culture-of youngsters particularly.
4,Funny. Good to watch once - perhaps twice.,"We bought it, watched it and laughed, and sent it to a friend serving overseas. The actress did a great job and the main actor did a very good job. It is worth watching if you want to rest your brain."
3,FAST AND FUNNY ACTION,"WASABI is a light-weight Hong Kong action film from writer/producer Luc Besson starring the always charismatic Jean Reno.High-energy hi-jinks unfold when no-nonsense Paris detective Fiorentini (Reno) is summoned to Tokyo to settle the estate of the only woman he loved. He discovers that her death was not an accident and that he's the father of a strong-willed, red-haired, Japanese teenage daughter (who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars (not yen). Oh yes, and some very, very, very bad guys want the big bucks.Terrific action set pieces deliver the pleasurable jolt of the spicy title.I liked this move a lot as a passing diversion. No profound meaning, but it sure looks great and the action rarely lets up for more than a few minutes. And there's plenty of sly wit to season the mayhem.Much better than you might first guess since you're probably wondering why you haven't heard of this title. With Reno and Besson doing their thing, it's slick and colorful and sly."
2,Sub-titles That Cannot Be Turned Off,"I have seen this movie several times and really like it. However, this may not be the version of the DVD you want. This DVD is in English AND English subtitles. There is no way to stop the subtitles I could find with my equipment. Very distracting."
2,Where is the real Besson?,"Great movie, great cinematics, great ""no-plot"" and great fun... only if you literally swallow ""Wasabi"" down your throat just exactly as Jean Reno does by almost the end of the movie. Forget the good-ol' Reno-The-Cleaner (Nikita), do not expect any twisting, noir and all-french action-plot: just pretend your are reading a colorful comic-book with plenty of no-brainer action.Besson should get back to deeper, more elaborated plots, with possibly less color extravaganza and much more atmosphere and acting."
1,One Star is Too Much,This is an awful movie. The writing is like that of an Italian fifth grader. The acting other than Jean Reno is terrible. The dialog is just pitiful. The action scenes are of the quality of a low budget Japanese action movie of the sixties.Whomever produced this movie must have a mistress in the movie is all I can think of that would justify financing this fiasco. The plot(s) are vague and disjointed and really is just one poorly done action scene interspaced with flat spots. One star is too good for this movie.
1,Ridiculously stupid movie.,"This was about his daughter he did not know about in Japan, from an old girlfriend when he was a spy there (I think). It was hard to follow, and the teenage Japanese girl was just too hard to take. The rest of it made no sense and I gave up watching halfway through (this was on my Iphone while flying, so it had to be pretty bad not to finish). Jean Reno is a great actor but this was not one of the good ones."
3,Jean Reno always good,well worth the watch. received package in good contition and on time.I will consider another purchas in the future.
2,"japan looks cool, movie not.","Recommended for somebody who never been in Japan or Tokyo. Movie kinda straight forward, a lot of useless action, suited for ages between 10 and 14. The producer never took advantage of being in Tokyo and, in short, I had seen this types of movies at least 1000 times. Please, teacher! You see some fancy shopping, fancy hotel and fancy criminals but you dont see real Japan. Yes, a lot of criminals are killed, I guess Japan has no shortage of them."
1,Yuk!,"Believe the other reviewers when they say ""Not Worth Your Time"" and ""Just A Bad Movie"". In general I'm a fan of Jean Reno, so I wanted to love this movie. But, it really IS awful. It's sort of a cross between ""Nash Bridges"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Yuk!"
1,Not worth your time,"This was silly at the beginning, silly in the middle, and I don't what at the end given that I was so bored I stopped watching it halfway through. It intends to be funny but falls way short, the characters are annoying -the ""spunky"" daughter he suddenly inherits is a willful smart-ass teenager, and the inspector is not convincing as a dad trying to protect his newfound daughter nor as a tough-cracking investigating officer. I regret the sleep I missed for this."
4,Good Book,"It does a good job, of informing.however, I was disapointed that it failed, to delve, into the crusaides. An importaint, topic, for understanding, middle eastern hatred and distrust; of the west. also chapter 6 ""Biblicalities""Is filled with misstatements,on biblical history."
4,an excelent book for beginners,"a very good book for beginners that have achieved a good grasp of the games basics,reviews several basic strategy and contains detailed game reviews that helped me a lotin my own games,i would recommend this for any beginner!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
2,Did not care for this tape....,"Although I do love Richard Simmon's workouts (with the exception of the Sweatin to the Oldies and the Dance Blastoff series), this one did not appeal to me. Although, I realize some of this is due to my taste in a workout, the workout does not seem structured enough for me. At times, they wander around and seem to ""wing it"". I'm not a ""wing it"" type person; I have to know what I am doing at all times of the exercise or I get discouraged. While this may be right up your alley, I did not care for it. If you are like me, and like a more structured workout, I did like Richard Simmon's Blast Off, Broadway Blast Off, Tone & Sweat (uses toning cords), Tone Up On Broadway (uses Chest/Arm stretching cords),Tonin Uptown (uses Richard Simmon's Tonin cords), Tonin Downtown (uses Tonin cords), Blast & Tone (uses weights, light pair and heavier pair), and Love To Stretch (uses Simmons Stretchin' Strap)."
1,VERY SLOW SHUTTER SPEED,"This is the worst camera I ever owned. The shutter speed is so slow that if you take a photo of a person walking in the room, you get an empty room. By the time the camera clicks you missed the moving image even if you change the speed or type of image, same result...awful..I purchased from here through Beach Camera and couldn't return it because I had sent in the rebate...UGH...Don't buy."
1,horrible,this camera is horrible. i havent even had it for year and first the lens got stuck and we had to get that fixed. Now the battery wont even recharge. I would never get this again.
1,broken clips,"i really was satisfied with the look and feel and price,,. the clips broke when putting it on the phone ...boo"
1,doesn't fit well,"this case did not fit my palm treo very well at all. The two halves would barely snap together, I couldn't get the stylus out, and my SD card was blocked as well. When I tried to get it off my phone, I nearly had to break it because it was stuck. Shipping also took forever. Bottom line--move on, don't bother."
1,The worst cover I ever buyed,Poor adjustment between the two faceplates. Nice finished but unusable...
4,Great deal!!,If you like casino games you will love this. The remote works great. Hours of fun for a great price.
1,"love it when it works, but doesn't work very long 1 month","We bought this for our dad at Christmas, as he doesn'thave a computer. He absolutely loved it, but after approximately 1 month it no longer worked. I am in theprocess of trying to get a replacement as it has a 90 day warranty from the manufacturer. The screens bleed through one another until you can't see what you are playing. This was an excalibur 15 in 1 plug and play."
1,Not worth the money,"Do not spend any money on this. There are far better products out there for only a few more $. The grapcis are awful, the sound is worse, and the games themselves are marginal. Sent this back and bought a different one that I really enjoy."
3,Not What I Expected,"I read the summary on the back of the book and was greatly interested so I bought it. When I actually sat down and read it I found that it could not hold my attention. The plot was a really good one but the characters lacked depth and I just couldn't picture in my mind that these people were real (which is what I do with any good book). The only reason I finished the book was because I wanted to know what happened. Unfortunately, I discoverd that this was just the first book with more to follow. My advice would be to go to the library instead of buying it."
2,Latico Vyntage Buckle Tote,"This bag looked good online but when I received it, I was not impressed by the quality of the Leather. It had absolutely no shine and looked as if it rubbed against anything it would have been ruined."
5,LOVE IT!!,I saw this costume a few years ago in the halloween stores... for $90. It broke my heart but I had to walk away. I bought it for halloween this year and just got it- LOVE IT!!!! It's comfortable and SO SEXY!!!
4,For strong-hearted horror readers only,This book has a horror that is really hard to digest. I recommend that readers who want to read this book have to brave the spurting deep dark features of devastation in this book. But it's also an entertaining novel. Horror fans will love it.
2,Splatterpunk and Pop Psychology,"This was the first book I ever threw in the bin. In fact, possibly the only one! I don't like throwing books away! Especially ones given to me.But this book left me feeling sullied and disturbed. No doubt that is partly the author's intention - it is, after all, a horror story. But this was one of the first ""splatterpunk"" novels, filled with gratuitous violence and far too much sex and deviancy. All this is mixed in with a kind of musical snobbery - the author's other trade - which clearly seeks to lift the novel out of the gutter into something more literary, but in fact it just grates horribly.There is also pop psychology. In fact the whole premise of the story revolves around some rather dubious pop psychology - and again that grates.This is not a book I am proud to have read. One to studiously avoid.(And yes, I know I will get some thumbs down for saying that - but if you do, I would appreciate a comment to explain why I am wrong!)"
2,Not as pictured,"The watch you actually receive is not a Reebok, but a Cardiosport. It looks the same, but clearly is not a Reebok - actually false advertising!It is also not 'slimline' at all - in fact it is thicker than both Polar and Freestyle models that I have owned. It is however the cheapest I have purchased, but please CHANGE THE PHOTO!"
3,Steering Wheel Replacement,"Steering wheel fit correctly on application. I expected an aftermarket replacement, but did not expect the inferior quality. The wheel is hard plastic and has a smaller girth; making operation of the mower more uncomfortable."
4,More powerful than tv,"This book has a gravity to it that is greater than the black hole of time and attention that is tv. My kids loved it and would sit and imagine themselves in the pictures (okay, so did I) as we traversed the lines blurred by Rob Gonsalves between real and surreal. The prose was nice but it is the paintings that make this such a delight. The only downside is the length; 33 pages, 16 paintings."
5,Imagine a Day,Great book for adults with curious imaginations and great to share with children who can still dream. The artist is a cool guy also.
4,"Forget the text, look at the pictures","This book consists of a wonderful collection of beautiful and creative drawings by Robert Gonslaves interspersed with poetic musings by Sarah Thompson. While most books listing an author and illustrator are mainly text, in this case the writing is superfluous at best, and annoying at worst. The sense of wonder inspired by the pictures needs no commentary, especially of the vacuous and meaningless stock thoughts written here. Don't get me wrong, the book is well worth the purchase price and can be looked at and enjoyed time and time again. Just next time, Gonslaves should strike out on his own with the art and perhaps some technical explanations of how he did what he did."
4,Oldie but was always a goodie,"I really can't even remember when i purchased this game, but i do know it was awesome."
1,Limited use,"For those considering the purchase of this unit, keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your Tv. Menus and playlists will not.The very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable isn't worth it. Get some 10.00 cables for your ipod and save money"
5,great online fun,"this game is good by itself but it has one of the largest online world i have ever seen in a game. at any point there are about 3,000 people in the public area. the only downside is that all the players are insanely good and begginers wont make it very far."
1,"BAD,BAD,BAD =(","I was looking forward to getting this game once i did and I installed it in to my computer(Dell- Pentium 3 Processor,Windows '98,95MB Ram,19KB space)and clicked on Missions it Stalled time and again it just stinks don't bother buyin' it unless you have a brand new comptuer cause it won't work on any thing older!!!!It does look very cool but i just didn't have enough ""SYSTEM MEMORY"" I GUESS TO PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,it good,well i do not think that it is for 13 it is not that bad but if you do not want your kid playing it well that is you i thenk that it is good
3,Novalogic should've stopped with Delta Force 2,"Delat 2 had everything I could ask for, lots of action, weapons terrain, everything. It was an improvement over Delta 1 by having slightly simpler keyboarding as well as the ability to blow more things up and a couple of hidden battles if you knew how to unlock them.Too bad Novalogic had to throw it all away, changing just about everything. I haven't played it yet, CD-ROM drive troubles, but the layout, graphics and just about everything else have been changed.My copy is I guess what would be called a reissue with the smaller box, it came with the Cd in a paper envelope, not a jewel case, and no instruction booklet (a shame as you don't use the keyboard exactly as you do in the first Delta's but more like the fourth one).I'm done with Novalogic."
5,It fun to play online!,"I play DF1 and DF2 a couple of times, but never really got into them. I played DF3(DFLW) and I have to tell you that it is fun to play. Also, The game has a great community of online players that are fun to play against and with. I recommend this game to anyone who likes online game play."
2,Good game - Company with out support,"DF Land Warrior did fix the DF graphics problems, looks good. My concern is the terrible or non-existing support from Novalogic. They will not answer any question and if they finally do, their answer is not going to help you. They like to sell and forget about customer.I have tried over years to get support from them but this is an eternal problem with out fix. They simply DON'T CARE, not even if you have bought them DF1, DF2, F22, Comanche, Comanche II and ComancheGold.My recommendation: It's O.K. to buy for a person who doesn't care about support. BUT, if you want to buy a Novalogic product with support, then, !!FORGET ABOUT IT - RUN AWAY AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!Joe"
2,Hugely disappointing,"The ONLY difference is the improvement in some of the graphics. Everything else has remained the same or has even worsened. The AI is SO SO bad I couldn't even beleive it. Forget about hiding in the grass (a great feature about DF1 and DF2) becouse you won't be seeing anymore grass. In sum, no reason to buy this. DF2 was better."
4,This is how we like it,"DF1 was good, DF2 was crap, DF3 Land Warrior is killer! This game has all the weapons you ever wanted to use and you can even drop them and pick up the weapons from your enemies. The 3D-graphics have improved, but what happened to the characters in 3rd person? They look silly. A serious flaw is the enemy AI. When I set the level to ""hard"" they kept staring at me like I had no pants on. Even when I stood 2 feet away from them. This allowed me to finish all 22 campaign levels in a day. Bummer. Coolest game on the market along with SWAT 3, but is it really worth the bucks?"
2,Weak!,"You can shred one page at a time - any more and it'll jam. Even with one sheet, it gets clogged from time to time. I've spent so much time picking bits of paper out of the teeth (and then vacuuming),that it's not worth my time. After one year of use, I'm going to get a more powerful one."
1,his,"I used to have another Fellowes shredder that worked well, so I thought this model would be just as good. This jammed ALOT... in addition, this is suppoed to shut off automatically if no paper is being fed in. Instead this would drone on and on despite no paper feed. This would still happen even if the bin was empty.Lesson: spend the money on a decent printer. Or if the average 100$ is too much, spend less on an assumed-to-be-crappy brand. This was a major disappointment."
1,Not a good shredder,This shredder has always been slow and I have to oil it constantly. I have had it a little over a year and it is constantly jamming to the point where 2 people have to sit down with something sharp and try to dislodge the pieces. This is after feeding in 1 sheet at a time and only using it a few times a month. I don't recommend this shredder to anyone.
1,jams a lot,"tried to take apart after warranty expired and was too difficult. decided it wasn't worth my time and trashed it. buying a new one, different model / manufacturer."
1,not impressed,"looks good but it doesn't fly anywhere near as well as it looks. a shame as expectations were high, avoid"
5,Folding Wings!,"I bought this plane with my Christmas money. Aim the plane straight up, let go and the plane shoots up into the sky! The wings pop open and then it glides down to the ground! If it catches a breeze on the way down it can glide a loooong way! When I;m done the wings fold back up and the plane fits in our bike pack!My name is Charlie and I'm 7 years old."
4,A little effort goes a LONG way!,"Contrary to the experience of others, I have had a great time with this glider! The one I built flies and glides well and does a full circle to the right from where I launch after zooming 40-60 feet up! I've found that the direction of the wind and the distance you stretch the rubber band launcher are things to experiment with. Not every flight is perfect, but it's all fun!"
2,Name is Different,"The airplane is NOT the Spirit of St. Louis; the real name is Phantom 54, by Guillows.It will go high when launched, but then the wings stay closed and the models falls backwards and looses altitude...a lot.When finally opens the wings, the airplane is very close to ground and glides just a bit; it comes with two elastic bands for the wings and I used both accordingly to instructions, but the thing was a failure...I got 12 of the Phantom 54 and after two being broken due to many try, I better gave them to kids in the park where I use to fly... I do not want more frustrations with these bad designed models.Gonzalo."
5,Queen of Salsa,"Celia Cruz is brought to life for young children in this colorful book. Like the tropics from which she came, the book is full of vibrant illustrations. The story is put into simple terms for young readers or a teacher or parent to read. Since the illustrations are so vibrant and bold children will be enthralled by the unique features of the art work. Each biographical page is bilingual for reading in Spanish or English or both. The book describes her early family life in Cuba, her departure after the revolution, her musical group Sonora Mantacera, meeting her musician husband,her associations with other salsa greats like Tito Puente and Willie Colon, her relocation to Miami and the various honors and recognitions she achieved. This is a great little book for primary and middle school libraries as well as community libraries. Students whoose first language is Spanish can benefit from the bilingual book through middle school years. This is a fun book."
2,Not interesting to children,"This seems like a book that would only be appreciated by adults. I can see it being used as a teaching tool for children in the classroom or as a resource for children when writing a book report, but not as leisure reading. The book also seems to have a bit of an identity crisis: Is it a poetry book? Is it non-fiction? Is it biography? At times the language is lovely and poetic and at other times it is not lyrical. I also found a few grammatical problems with the Spanish. I wanted to like this book especially since it was recently recognized, and as an adult reader there are things I did like, but I don't see how it would appeal to children."
2,"Uh, no.","I like my rock bios as much as the next guy, but this one was torture. Halfway through it I realized that I could have cared less about the subjects at hand, John Phillips, the Mamas & Papas, who slept with Michelle, which arm he shot which drug into, etc., and vowed to be more selective in the future when seeking out my books. Not even one for the beach."
1,"Sadly, Not About His Music","John Phillips biography ""Papa John"" barely mentions his songs and focuses entirely on his personal hedonistic escapades.Although some of his adventures were amusing and eventually vomitous, Phillips did himself a huge disservice when writing his biography by skimming his contributions to popular music.If he had a decent editor who cared about his music, this version of ""Papa John"" never would have seen the light of day.If you want to find out more about his music, try Go Where You Wanna Go: The Oral History of The Mamas and The Papas by Matthew Greenwald. It's a much better tribute to the man and his music."
1,Stay away from this one,"I wasn't even born when this group was popular but knew the music from my parents. Got this book a few weeks ago and it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. The group was only together a few years and this tells the story of his whole life. Other then the years where the group was together the rest of the book lacks a lot, unless you like to hear about drug use. Seems like 75% of the book centers around drug use and in great detail. Maybe it was my mistake to think that the book would be more about the group. Seems like he talked more about his 3rd wife more then Michelle who was in the group with him. Just not enough about the group. When Mama Cass dies he mentions the whole thing on 1 page and that's it then right back to his drug use stories. He gets into more detail about every drug he used more then every song he sang. Was painful to read after the he gets past the early 70's."
4,Shocking look into the rock-n-roll/sex/drugs 60's to 80's,John Philips look (distorted?) back on his life is a real eye-opener of the trials and tribulations and traps of the 1960's rock-n-roll/sex/drug scene. A must read for those amateur contemporary historians with a voyeur mentality!
3,papa john,"I agree with others who read ""Papa John....."" . There certainlywas a lot of info that could have been omitted, I believe. Themost interesting parts, to me (and Mamas & Papas fans), was hisreferences to how the group formed, the creative period of theirformation in the 60's, and his relationship with Michelle. Thedescriptions of his downward spiral into the madness of heavydrug abuse was hard to read and very graphic. His self-destructivenesscould have easily killed him, as it did so many other music artistsof that era and since. It's a long book, and at times, I felt likeI was drenched in drugs after reading the 30 chapters. Since the book was copywritten in 1986, I would like to know how his life was in the 15 years AFTER the book was published, and until his death in 2001."
4,"Great instructional book, but not necessarily for beginners","Teach Yourself Bluegrass Mandolin is a great instructional guide for mandolin. It is clearly written and provides both melody and solo parts for a number of traditional bluegrass tunes. The CD that accompanies it is an added bonus for those that like to hear exactly how each tune is supposed to sound. However, if you are picking up a mandolin for the first time with no previous experience playing a stringed instrument this book may leave you frustrated. I had a few years of experince playing guitar so the switch wasn't too difficult. However, I know that I was starting for the first time I would be hard pressed to play many of the songs in this book. The tunes on the CD are played quite fast, especially for beginners. If you are looking for a beginners guide I would pick something a little easier. But once you've built up your dexerity and you're ready to move up I would recommend this book."
4,Great book for the beginner mandolin player,"This is a great book for anyone trying to learn how to play the mandolin. It contains several good songs, tons of good advice on technique, and a cd to refer to when written descriptions just won't get the job done (just try to describe ""chunking"" to someone who has never heard it before).The best part of this book is how it describes a technique and then immediately teaches you a song or two that use that technique. I find this helps to keep the learning process fun and exciting. It also give you a lot of material to show off to your friends."
3,"Good solos, but light on technique/exercises","As previously mentioned, this is probably not a great book to start with if you're new to the mandolin. There are good arrangements, each with a melody and solo, but other than the few obligatory ""how to read notation and tablature"" and ""how to hold the mandolin"" pages, there's not much in the way of helpful exercises or theory. It's hard to ""Teach Yourself"" from this book alone.One thing worth noting for crossover musicians, though, is that this book has a lot of tunes in common with Tony Trischka's ""Teach Yourself Bluegrass Banjo"", also from Oak publishing."
4,"Great songs to learn, not the best teaching","THe songs in this book are a great collection of things that are great to learn. Each song has two ways to play it: the melody and a solo-type version. I have found that you can go through it and learn the melody parts then probably go back and be ready for the harder solo version. The reference CD has great playing on it, but it is a bit fast, and could be discouraging for the true beginner. Buy this book to learn with. Hold off on using the CD until you are really getting the stuff under your fingers."
2,be careful - there are different generations of this product -,I bought this for a second generation shuffle - the one that charges with the same jack that you plug your headphones in to. It doesn't work for this. Either I didn't read the listing or they switched - I'm not sure - threw 'm out.
2,which shuffle do you have?,Be aware this is not compatable with the newest version of shuffle currently on the market - you need an old shuffle for this to be of any use.
3,Do you really need one?,"The iPod Shuffle dock serves the same purpose as that of the Mini and the iPod 4G dock; easy charging and syncing. But since the Shuffle is already so small, there is no need to plug it up in a dock. It doesn't really need a stand, since it isn't made to look elegant. It's made to look compact and small. I have two USB port's in the front of my CPU casing, so there isn't any need for me to pay $30 to buy a dock.The dock may be a useful buy for those who have their USB ports tucked up behind their PC case, and find it to be pain to locate and plug in their iPod. Yes, the dock does look nice, but then again, does it really have a purpose?"
4,Works nicely as universal USB connector for thumb drives,"Now that the era of 1st gen iPod shuffles is actually long time over and this connector can be bought for cheap (I paid $8 for mine, including shipping and handling), it can do the job quite nicely as a stand for USB thumb drives. No more bending when inserting thumb drives into under-the-desk slots or struggling to find the USB connectors on the back of the keyboard. Note: the idea is not mine, I saw it on flickr."
3,Nice but overpriced,Could not get my Shuffle to work with the front USB ports on my Dell computer. But it works just fine in a rear port.This dock connector would be a great convenient solution. However I feel it is overpriced at $30.
3,Bad quality,"You get what you pay for when buying stuff like this. For me, it broke after a few uses, it is cheaply made. Don't expect too much.I would not buy this again."
2,Boring...,"This a horribly boring game. I played Snood, and read that this game was similar so I purchased it for my Game Boy Advanced. It's hard to see and all the colors blur together. Not a very high quality game."
3,Not What the Picture says,"Unfortuanately, I have had the previlage to play Bust-a-move on Playstation. However, this version of Bust-a-move on Game boy is good but does not measure up to a playstation version. The graphics are poor and the characters are not much better. I know that graphics can be much more vibrant and crisp and clear than on this game. One would think a game made for the new Millennium would surpase any of the game I have purchased in the past."
5,Inspiring,"I have found Dr. Wilson's method compelling, his arguments and theology of preaching sound. I have committed myself to try his plan for awhile and check the results. However, I would recommend this book to any preacher, even if you are perfectly satisfied with your own preaching and don't see a need to change. For how often do you get to hear great sermons? More than anything, I found The Four Pages of the Sermon an extended sermon written just for me, inspiring me with a solid message of Gospel truth. Both in the instructive sections and the sermon excerpts, I felt myself bathed in the Light of God's Grace and often moved to tears. So, yes, it's a great preaching text, but I'd recommend it as well as a meditation for preachers who need reminding of what they are to be about."
5,Wilson Has It Together,"Having been in the pulpit weekly now for about seventeen years, I have read just about every book on preaching published. Some are clearly better than others. Some are classics. Some are pretty bad. Wilson knows of what he speaks, and I have found his reflections in this book and his ideas to be worthy of practice/ consideration/ emulation and use. He divides the week up into do-able sections with a different daily purpose and places the sermon out in four pages--each page with its own emphasis or direction. Like a master guide pointing out the obvious as one walks through the same stretch of woods for the thousandth time, I noticed, under Wilson's direction, things that I either had taken for granted, or had not paid attention to before-- I did what he said and my preaching improved. I found his remarks cogent, useful, right on the mark, and encouraging. This is one of the better books on preaching recently published and worth your attention."
2,a decent start...,"My biggest problem with this book is that it imposes a hermeneutic on the Bible that isn't always good--it forces you to look for trouble or grace in a text which may not legitimately include it. Also, I have found it to create a very predictable pattern that can become tiresome. Furthermore, I sincerely value authenticity from the pulpit and I found this to be difficult when using this method."
3,Book a Solid C,"This book has good information, but the author's passion for repeating himself yields a text that is literally twice as long as it needs to be to communicate the same information. It is very difficult to plow through due to the monotony. If you have trouble writing sermons or have never tried it before then the book offers a practical formula for doing so. This is a book that the average person will not finish unless they truly need the information it contains."
1,didn't even spark a match,"it's easy to say my life is over when i've seen too much stupidly god awful horror movies. i'd pull the trigger before watching this movie if I were you folks. starts off at a strip joint which is a nice beginning by the way, dumb, idiotic piece about hybrid werewolves pummels into a mess with its own self. Jaime Bergman who was the chick cop killed in the hospital played on Son Of The Beach and is also David Boreanaz's, Tv's Angel, wife. Nudity is a bundle in this and the mindnumbing laughable special effects with the person computerized transforming doesnt help it. It's a junk pile to begin with. Stephen Williams from Route 666 is also in this and he dies at the beginning and Kane Hodder who played Jason in like 8 of the Jason movies plays the biker werewolf hybrid. a ***king waste"
5,-,"I began watching this movie thinking to myself ""man this is pure garbage"" but somewhere along the line I became a fan.I began typing an Amazon review in ""real time"", criticizing every scene on how dumb it was. I guess 45 minutes into it I could no longer type anything bad about it and was drawn in to this cheesy ""B"" flick. It was clear that the budget was minimal (oh boy was it clear), but they made this movie work with lots of bewbies and great acting.The werewolves in this movie are a sad, pitiful site in they're mechanical, outfitted and CGI states but there's more to this movie than the mindless violence and the appearances of werewolves."
2,Bad Moon Rising (Very Bad),"Werewolves...I love 'em. I watch just about every werewolf film I can find looking for a quality lycanthrope movie. This film isn't one of them. I was encouraged by the positive reviews on this page to rent this movie and was highly disappointed.The film is full of long, dry spells of poor dialog delivered by mediocre actors. The werewolf itself is a man in an unconvincing, rubbery suit augmented by some video game quality CGI work. If you still must see it, rent it before you shell out the money on buying it. (It's much easier to waste $3 instead of $24.)For some great werewolf action check out An American Werewolf in London, Ginger Snaps, or Dog Soldiers. Any of these films are far superior.Oh yeah, the only reason I gave this movie two stars is for the large amount of gratuitous nudity."
2,I was hoping for somthing more.,"For entertainment value I would give this movie a ""D minus"". I watched the producers, writer and actors comentaries and I would beg to differ with almost everything they said. I bought this movie because it was inexpensive, recommended and purported to have world class nudity. I would agree that the girls featured were probably the most attractive thing about this project. But, the first time writer would be well advised to not put this effort on his resume.. for any of a number of reasons.. The acting was at least O.K. but, nothing exemplary to brag about.... and, again, bad plot lines and dialogue are difficult to overcome.I did not "" hate"" this film, but, I would not recommend it either."
5,I love Darkwolf!,"I watched this movie on Saturday night with a bunch of friends. Horror films are always great on A Saturday night and this one was one of the best. Darkwolf did not disappoint for a second. It was a fast-paced gory, sexy ride with attractive teens and a cool monster that manages to eat mostly all of them, but not before they get naked. People who analyze this film need to get a life...and just sit back and enjoy.I gotta admit that I just bought a copy to keep for myself. Maybe I'll watch it again next Saturday night."
1,Worst werewolf movie ever!,"Bad acting , low-budget (and I mean low!)special effects,and a plot that seems to be just an excuse to film nude scenes. The characters are uninteresting and one dimensional. If you feel that you have to subject yourself to this kind of torture I recommend you rent it first and save a few bucks. Better yet, buy Bad Moon with Michael Pare' (of Eddie and the Cruisers fame)and Mariel Hemingway if you want to see a GOOD werewolf movie, because Darkwolf is a dog!"
2,would be best to keep this film in the dark,"not a huge fan of werewolf movies but i do like The Howling, Wolfen, and Silver Bullet to name a few. but this movie is not that good at all!! obviously it will appeal to some of the younger generation but the movie concentrated on showing to much nudity and not enough well written action scenes. did have a terrible story and was completely predictable. while the werewolf was pretty well made, the movie was just not that good. i know a lot of kane hodder fans will check the film out but don't expect anything great. decent rent at best unfortunately"
1,The worst werewolf movie ever made,"I would've given this film 0 Stars if it would have let me. I've seen every werewolf movie from Naschy's Mexican lycanthropic romps to every installation of the Howling and I have NEVER seen a worse werewolf movie. Anyone who liked the special effects in this one would be impressed with the graphics from old Atari videogames -- seriously, it's that bad. And acting? Give oscars to the cast from Plan 9 from Outer Space and attack of the Killer Tomatoes compared with the performances in this piece of celluloid trash. No..it's not even good enough to be in the same category as trash. Let's see what else, oh yeah a plot? Nope, none to speak of here. The sex and nudity is the only reason I even finished it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this flick like rabies, or you'll find yourself wishing you had the last hour and a half of your life back."
4,"A+ ""B"" Movie","A cool looking werewolf ripping people to shreds and beautiful, naked women rubbing on each other? who could ask for more in a movie? This is one of the better B movies I've seen, I recommend it highly. I wish all the B horror films I buy were as good as this one. The scene on the rooftop is worth the price of the movie all by itself. Check it out."
4,Great work.,"I think the book is wonderful, it covers a looot of information on fasting, the theory of disease, food, and health. I think it is verbose. This is just a personal opinion, however, because I like to get the essence of things and teachings and run with it. I do not always like getting long, detailed, factual, repetitive information. BUT don't get me wrong, the book is fantastic, for learning and for future reference."
3,"Too small, too many logos","We bought the Large size - it's far too small for our 70 lb Bernese Mountain Dog. Even with the strap extended to it's largest size, it's quite snug (it's a stretchy material). The hat itself also appears more like a paper party hat, due to its small size, than a santa hat.Also, there are logos front and back on this hat - a paw print on one side, and a brand logo on the other. They're embroidered, and large enough to detract from the appearance of the hat."
3,"Cute hat, but unfortunately not for my dog","This hat is really cute- it's basically everything its advertised to be, but my maltese hated it. It seems like the strap under the chin was going to choke him. The one picture I have of him wearing it, he looks miserable. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
4,No room for error,"If you get this make sure you get a size bigger that your dogs head. I got this for a 3 week old Golden Retriever. I had a litter to sell for Xmas and wanted to use this as a prop for the online store to sell. The problem is that the strap has no lee-way so to make it fit I had to cut it and use velcro. I put it on my mom's Shi Tsu and same thing, so beware, it not expandable but is of good guality and looks and feels good."
4,It's cute,"It is a nice hat for x-mas pictures. I think it could be improved by shaping the base more for the shape of a dog's features (along the back where the skull and neck meet) but overall we are happy with it and it served it purpose. It didn't bother the dog and she had no problem posing for the pictures but she is pretty laid back, other dogs may not like something on their head but the strap should hold it long enough for a picture."
2,"Xmas Sand Hat, small","Very ill fitting and way too small for the mutt! Other articles that I have bought for him have been size small, (collars, clothes, etc) and they fit. Maybe I read the dimensions wrong. Win a few and lose a few....lose a few...lose a few."
4,Small is SMALL,"We got a size small for our cat, who has a smaller head to begin with and it was WAY too small. The elastic is very tight and she was no happy with us at all. I like the idea of the hat but they really need to give some measurements for each size and indicate the level of stretch in the elastic. oral of the story: I would suggest getting a hat one size bigger than you think (the elastic can be adjusted for length)"
4,So cute,"I bought this for my russian blue cat for Christmas. She looked absolutely adorable in it. It was good enough to take nice pictures and that's what I wanted. The only complaint I have is that it seemed slightly tight around my cat's neck. It fitted the head perfectly, just the band around the neck should've been a little more flexible, thats why I took away a star from the rating. Otherwise its really cute."
3,C'mon Pete Rock!!!,Pete did it again with this one but there's a couple of joints that I like. It's cool that he put out an album to keep his statis alive but he got to break out the big guns...
4,soulbrother no. 1 back in action,"New work from Soulbrother No. 1, emperor of underground djs, master of ceremony: the mood is softer than ever, but stamina flows as usual. Best track and charming raps with Little Brother, who need to prove the world they can do without 9th Wonder, king of underground djs. Fine come back of the Lords of the Underground, no longer chief rocka, but good to hear again. Nice reggamuffin in ""Ready Fe War"". Velvet carpets under the R&B of Rell and Tarrey Torae. Not memorable, but the atmosphere of a Pete Rock album is always worth the buy."
3,decent,"this album has some good Hip-hop and better than average beats but Pete's flow is very dated and boring for tha most part. Masta Killa has a pretty hot verse on PJ's and Little Brother comes off nice, but i found this album a little bit boring. For fans of his work, they should be pleased however. He makes entirely too many references to his beats and skills behind tha boards to make up for lack of lyricism. I think with some better hooks this album could have been hotter."
2,"Hard to understand, difficult to read","I have been trading futures for about 3 years, and wanting to learn more about spread trading. This book is very dry reading, and difficult for a beginner to go through. No color graphs. Just boring tables with numbers, and many words. Not an easy book for a visual learner. Seasonality is hinted upon, but no good charts provided, and he does not really tell you when to do what, or what triggers or conditions to look for to enter a position. His section on spread options trading is perhaps easier to grasp, and I did learn a bit from that. A more advanced trader might perhaps glean more from this book than I did, but I do not recommend it for the beginner."
1,A BIT SUSPICIOUS!!!...,"I have yet to read this book, however, so far the ***** average rating is quite suspicious... Each one of the three *****-reviewers, does not have a single other review in their profile. I am at the stage where I am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading, so I would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real-life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book, to do everyone of the rest of us a favor, and post an honest review - please, we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w/ the author or his publisher..."
3,Not like the old ones,I recieved the product in great shape.I was disappointed that it wasn't like the one I had.It makes this piercing tone. I move it around and it quits some.I don't think I would purchase another. Sorry
1,Beware scams from this magazine! Do not reply to any offers from or about the magazine!,"I received an ""opinion poll"" claiming I would be sent a free calendar if I filled it out (no mention of trial subscription or anything like that--I never accept such ""offers."") I never received a free calendar, but instead started receiving invoices for my ""subscription."" Despite my contacting the company both by mail and by e-mail, I am continuing to receive the bogus invoices claiming I subscribed to this magazine. Watch out for any offers from or about this magazine."
2,Disappointed!,"I got a large timbuk2 classic messenger, thought it would be great the get the pad as well. When i used it, it hurt my shoulder! rather carry my bag without the strap pad."
1,griptex should change name to sliptex,"This is supposed to keep messenger bag from slipping off your shoulder. For me, it did the exact opposite. Its big and bulky, uncomfortable. Wearing a winter coat, it just slides right off. So I tried just wearing it without a coat,same thing, slides more than original pad. Save your money, this does not work if slipping is the issue you're having."
1,It doesn't grip,"Purchased this in desperation because I can't find the Air Cell shoulder pad Amazon used to carry. If you're looking for padding to make a strap more comfortable, this might work for you. But if you're looking for something that will grip your shoulder and prevent (or at least discourage) the strap from sliding off, this fails totally. Otherwise, I've always liked Timbuk2's messenger bags. Was I foolish to expect that a product called ""Griptex"" would stick to my shoulder? For my needs it was a waste of money."
1,Nor very grippy and too stiff,"This pad is slightly more grippy than the stock Timbuk2 shoulder pad. It is at its best with a heavy load as the extra weight will cause it to mold to your shoulder. Without a heavy load it's too stiff and sits on top of your shoulder, causing light loads to dig in. A good design compromise would be to cut the foam into small sections so it will warp around the shoulder with both light and heavy loads. So I remove it when my bag is fairly light.1/18/20013 Update: Most of the grippy texture wore smooth after a few months of moderate use, making it as slippery as the stock pad. You might want to consider a Manhattan Portage or Crumpler shoulder pad. Both have more durable grip surfaces and are designed better. I deducted a couple stars since this pad is not very durable or grippy. The Timbuk2 bags are great but the shoulder pads need to go back to the drawing board."
2,Doesn't make the bag any better,"Bought one, but doesn't make the bag any more comfortable. It still hurts on your shoulder. It does add a little to stability for the timbuk2 classic messenger but not by much."
3,Gripster,"The gripster does what it says, and moves much less than the stock Timbuk2 shoulder pad. The level of comfort does not significantly increase, however I may not be a fair judge. I have a medium Commander bag and carry about 20-30 pounds of books and other class items, so I may be at a point where shoulder comfort is improbable due to the weight I'm carrying."
4,Great upgrade,"This is a great to the standard strap pad that comes with a Timbuk2. It's very comfortable and, as advertised, I've not had it slip on my should one bit, regardless of if I'm wearing a coat or not."
3,too large and heavy for my needs,"I cannot find a small strap for a woman's purse. This looked promising, but it was too long and heavy.May I suggest a smaller pad?"
2,Why is this an extra?,"I picked up a bag for my 17inch Macbook Pro and got to the counter only to be asked ""do you want to buy the strap pad?"". What? Why isn't this a standard item like on Crumpler bags? It's okay I guess. It is slightly padded, but I really don't see why I should have to pay extra for something that should be included with the bage"
4,"excellent product, textbook quality","I am taking a sign language class and my instructor uses this book as her text. It is a great book and I have even heard of people using it on their own to learn! Some of the signs are outdated but I think there is a new edition coming out this year. In addition to signs, sentences, fingerspelling and structure, this book teaches some deaf culture which is very useful when learning sign language. Excellent product!"
3,Very Bizarre little B-Movie,"Well, I would have never seen this little flick if not for two of my friends. They were at a mall, shopping for DVDs and they saw the title... Instantly they thought of me, which really worries me...But, not one to waste a free DVD, I watched this immediately. It's entertaining, to be sure, but it is really BAD. The acting, the writing, those good ol' ""Special"" effects. Awful, all of them, which, I think, is the reason it's so entertaining.The zombies are great. They look as if they're covered in scrambled eggs.But the best thing, of course, is the score. Why did they give it a ""James Bond""-ish score? I don't know but it works!My only problem is a story point: It's not a musical. If it had been, it would've been a five, easily. Alas, it's not, so it's only a three..."
3,OK,"As someone new to the field, I found this book hard to digest in terms of modeling. I'm trained as a modeler, so I'm hoping to pick up what has been done in the area. However, I found the modeling parts of the books rather slopping. Equations given not telling how they've been derived, worst, approximations are used all the times. You could sometimes guess how the formulae are derived but not the approximations used. After going thru several sections in Chapter 3, I'm skipping the formula ... The mathematics are easy but they are written in such a way that's hard to follow."
2,Difficult to read,I am a beginner of PK/PD modeling. I have found that this book is not for me. I have to make a lot of guess work to figure out how the formulas are derived in this book.
3,Living in questions...an ok place to be,"Dr. Timothy Johnson of ABC fame presents a great text about his personal spiritual journey intermixed with science, medicine, service, and theology.The book quickly becomes an apologetic book in the Josh McDowell style. It is clearly written for the non-believer.The most exciting part of the book is the first 20 pages and the final 20 pages where he is living in the questions of his own spirituality. The scientific and historical parts of the text are interesting to read but nothing particularly new or different as you would find in other apologetic text.Allowing Dr. Johnson to live in the questions of his faith is where he finds his greatest strength and would be the greatest encouragement to his readers."
1,A complete waste of your money,"I found the book very poorly written. The language is full of industry jargon and provides limited insight into the automotive sector in India. In addition, there are several data errors."
1,Delivers nothing over the docs,"I got this book on the cheap, and for that I'm thankful.This book is little more than a re-hash of the existing MSDN documentation. And as far as being a pocket reference, well it's not that small, and a good deal of the size/weight is wasted on guff in my opinion. If there were an O'Reilly equivalent, it would be a third the size and at least thrice as useful. (Any one who has read or owns one of the O'Reilly pocket reference series will scoff at this book.)I find this book marginally useful not having to look up the MSDN documentation - so if you're working on configuring new servers and surfing the net is not an option you may find this handy. But the content lacks, the writing style is poor, and the examples are not particularly helpful.Not a succinct pocket reference."
2,Not-So-Hot Elevator Music,"This really is an elevator music album, literally. It's not a symphonic take on Brian Wilson/BB music, though it does utilize a small section of the LA Symphony. It's music made for grocery shopping. Not one of Gary Usher's finer moments, though he did have many worthy projects as a writer and producer throughout his career. This one is worth skipping; you won't listen to it more than once, I guarantee it."
1,God Awful rendition of Brians Music,"Whilst I appreciate Garys contribution the the Beach Boys and Brians music this collection is elevator music of the most pernicious kind. Void of any soul, it does a great disservice to the music and renders it ordinary, boring and lifeless.I STRONGLY recommend anyone intent on buying this should listen to a couple of tracks first"
