2,worthless except for the 3500 vocab list,...The logic sesion does not reflect the true test. The logic section tutorial does not help at all...
1,Agatha Christie Mystery Collection [Hardcover],"Descsription is misleading. I ordered the book expecting to receive many titles collected in 1 volume, but received only ""Murder on the Orient Express""!!! I will never order books from Wonderbooks55 again. Why should 1 book cost $73 while another story by the same author costs only $10."
2,Not suitable for Go players,"There is a small community of programmers attempting to create Go playing computer programs and this effort has met with some small success. To say the least, this work is in it's infancy - at least if this book is any indication.If you're actually interested in Go, this book is not going to be much help. There are numerous alternative publications suitable for learning about the game. By the authors' own admission, virtually none of the ""endgame positions"" featured in this book would ever appear in a real game of Go played between humans with reasonable skill.I imagine the material is somewhat interesting, at least in the abstract sense, but I would not recommend it to anyone looking for more than that."
2,"Interesting reading, but not worth of owning","The title of the book should be understod literally. The book is not about 'last point' in sence of final argument to the topic, but really about which player, white or black gets the last point in Go game. This also means, that if you utilize all knowledge from this book either in your playing of Go or incorporate it into Go playing program, you at best score 2 points more territory in comparison to you opponent than without this knowledge. Reading this book is revealing in some sence, since it proves some 'common sence' assumptations wrong and gives some insights of mathematical handling of the Go, but the scope of the book is very limitted."
5,Undoubtedly,"the best DVD investment I have made. This is the first and most inexpensive player that I have bought, and it has outlasted a slew of high priced trash. The major plus is that it plays most dvds without sending copy protection to your recorder enabling you to make back-ups of those hard to replace out-of-print dvds."
3,does the job (depending...),"cheap from wal-mart. problem... doesn't play DVD+R which sux. will only play my DVD-R. i think manufacturers should make this very clear somewhere in the description or packaging.another problem is this thing hums real loud like a shaky internal motor or something. i fix the problem by inserting disc and then turning it on its side vertically upright. make sure you turn it back normal when ejecting (a dvd once fell into the player).if you want a regular player for standard movies, this will play them. however, if you burn your own, make sure you get the right format blank DVD (DVD-R). 3 stars for good price..."
2,"Not bad..,just not right for me","I've had my Apex 1201 for a few years and it's worked well, but we use it as our ""spare"" dvd player in the guest room. This DVD player will NOT play DVD+R discs, so I really have no use for it since most of my movies are on DVD+R. It plays DVD-R's and CDR's with no trouble.This player is also very loud, so I wouldn't recommend it as your primary DVD player."
4,Excellent DVD player,"Are you in the need for an inexpensive DVD player? Apex is the one for you. I purchased mine for a low price, not expecting much. However, this player amazed me. For the price, it is a high-quality item, capable of playing DVDs, CDs, mp3s, and photo cds. While its looks may not be stylish, it offers a great performance for the price."
1,4 months and dead,"I bought this on Sept 11, 2004. It died on Jan 29, 2005.My compliments to Apex for getting it to work past the 90 day warranty so they don't have to repair it. Even if it were within the 90 days, good luck on contacting them through their website since almost everything clickable on their homepage causes some kind of error with every one of the three browsers I tried.I don't mind they don't have an 800 number but it turns out their service number from the US is to Canada.No more Apex for me!"
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR CHRISTMAS IN 2002, BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS. I EXPERIENCED DVD MOVIES FREEXZNG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MOVIE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. THE WHOLE THING FROZE. THEN IT WOULD NOT READ ANYTHING AND TELL ME THERE WAS NO DISC. IT WOULDN'T LOAD AND IT WAS LOUD. TO GET IT TO WORK I HAD TO MOVE IT AROUND. WHEN I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THE COMPANY GAVE ME A HARD TIME ABOUT IT. THEN I COULD NEVER CONTACT THEM AGAIN. THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAP AND NOT WORTH $5."
5,Beautiful Faucet,This faucet is simply gorgeous. I have 2 in my kitchen: one on the main sink and one on the prep sink with the sprayer tucked underneath the counter for bucket filling. They function perfectly. Installation was quick and easy.
1,BIG MISTAKE,"This is not an ibook. The image shown is one of the newer towers which retails for $2100. An ibook is a laptop, which makes me suspect that someone is trying to pull a fast one."
1,ruined convertible top,I bought this item last year for Christmas. It is not only NOT waterproof but trapped water in between ruining my 1991 Trans Am convertible top by molding = $1500 to replace. The material got so saturated it ripped when trying to take it off the car.
1,Polaroid LCD TV,We have had 2 of these TV's. Both stop working. The first one was within 15 days of purchase and the second one 1 yr and 2 weeks. Powering the TV on and off you will hear a popping noise and soon you no longer have a picture only audio.
1,AWFUL SERVICE! AWFUL TV!,My FLM-3232 was purchased from Circuit City in April 06. It broke down in November 06. I called Polaroid's farmed out warranty company. They located a service center which I dropped it off at. The tech could not fix it so Polaroid stated they would send out a refurbished unit. That was three weeks ago. I just called Polaroid. They told me the replacement unit has been sitting at their facility and they forgot to send it out to the service center. They stated it would be another two weeks before it would arrive at the service center. Awful!!! Stay away from Polaroid.
1,Defective- Please file complaint at FTC and BBB for recall!,"Like many others my tv died after 8 mths. I have been waiting for 4.5 weeks now and still have no idea how long it will be before they fix it. The Warranty Center lies to you (IE different ETA's on the same day of calling in, they tell you your warranty is extended, then no it's not, then it ""freezes"" from the day you phone in but won't give you anything in writing.)I finally decided to file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and will be calling Better Business Bureau to do the same. From the number of negative reviews I've seen on the Amazon and Circuit City websites I hope everyone else will do the same. This is obviously a defective product line and should be recalled by Polaroid. We should not have to suffer and waste our time chasing after them to get this resolved. The phone call to FTC only took 10 minutes. Please take action!!"
1,Just don't Do it,this tv is horrible. I convinced myself that an inconstant buzzing from the tv normal for the last 1.5 years from the tv has died. I purchased it in oct 06 found out after searching the internet this problem is more common than it should be.
1,Works well when it works ...,I bought my FLM-3232 (refurbished) in sep 2006 from tiger direct store. The tv worked wonderfully till about 3 weeks ago then it just wouldn't power up.My research on the internet showed other people having the same problem. I had bought extended warranty with it and I am still waiting for the check to arrive.Warranty is in the form of a gift card with tiger direct and cost about 150$. So I am stuck with buying my next tv from tiger direct as well. Not a good experience at all.
4,Good TV for the price,"I have had this TV now for 5 years. I have not had one single issue with this TV. Picture quality is good, sound is good. It has been used as my main TV since new. I am now moving it to the bedroom as I just bought a new 50"" Samsung 3D plasma for the living room. My only complaint is it has just one HDMI connection."
1,Do not buy a polaroid TV,I have a 32inch Flatscreen HD. After 8 months the remote sensor on the TV gave up. I could turn the TV on but nothing else. Additionally the DVD motor kept running. Confirmed it was the sensor by using the remote on another Polaroid and it worked fine.Called the warranty number and after 35 mins of being transferred to half a dozen people they said send it in. I had to pay the shipping. Well I live in Georgia and the repair facility is in California. So the costs of packaging and shipping are prohibitive. Asked the warranty place if they would pay for shipping (they are contracted to Polaroid and evidently do not care) and they said no. I have taken the TV into the local repairman who said the Polaroid flatscreens are the worst but he'd do his best.Moral of the story? DO NOT BUY A POLAROID TV otherwise you'll be sorry. Oh I also e mailed Polaroid customer service (who are a complete joke)and they never replied.
1,Mine Broke Too!,"Owned the tv for 14 months and it automatically shut down one day. Now it wont turn back on. I replaced the fuse, still doesn't work. Only 12 month warranty, so I'm out of luck. Polaroid says I will have to pay to have repaired, or they offered to exchange for the same tv for $450. NO THANK YOU!!!"
1,Fix for polaroid tv,"Just so everyone knows there is now a fix you can do yourself that will cost under $5. Go to this webpage and a gentleman has his description of what he did to fix the tv. I just bought the parts today, but have not attempted to do the fix yet. There is a bout 50 people who have commented and the fiw worked for them. Hopefully anyone that has a problem will go there and attempt to do the fix themeselves."
2,"Great band, Limp result","Wretched, tin-foil thin production maligns the first dispensible BT album. Sure, there some great songs swimming around, but trying to fish them out of the scrawny sound pool whipped up by the Robb Brothers is more frustrating than rewarding. See LET ME COME OVER or SLEEPY EYED for BT at their best, and leave BIG RED LETTER DAY for the viewers of crappy teen dramas."
5,A MUST BUY!!,"From top to bottom, one of the best album's money can buy. I rank it right up there with Afghan Whigs-""Gentlemen"" and Sunny Day Real Estate's-""Diary"". Let's hope Buffalo Tom stays as anonymous as the Whigs and SDRE."
5,cult yet sexy ... and very Greek,"A pair of tongue-in-cheek comic shorts from Giannaris: ""Caught Looking"" satirizes the evolution of gay fantasy icons from Victorian times to the present, and ""North of Vortex"" explores an emotional menage a trois between strangers. Well as you can guess it is a film that you must see...."
5,Thanks your help through the GREAT reviews!,I was looking for a replacement stylus...that would fit my Palm m515. I read the reviews for this stylus and it sounded too good to be true. I took a chance and ordered one. I received it yesterday. I can not tell you how WONDERFUL it feels and what a nice change it is from the 'usual' stylus! It's GREAT!! I'd like to thank the other reviewers because without their input I would have 'passed over' this BEST stylus. I'm sure I'll order another in the future.
5,You'll fall in love with this single!,"Is there a greater love song than Scissor Sisters' ""Mary?"" I'd say ""no!"""
1,"Misspellings, Typos -- MISTAKES","In the first three pages I found two typoes, and as I flipped through the book homophones like their/they're and its/it's and you're/your kept popping up. As a writer myself, these jumped out and slapped me in the face. The factual errors were just out of laziness, not even to advance the plot. I was really looking forward to this book, but instead I just ended up returning it to Amazon -- a first for me. It's too bad this young writer was let down by his editors, and didn't take the time to read closely himself. PLEASE NOTE ALSO: The other two reviewers at the time of this writing didn't give their names, leading me to wonder if they're not friends of the ""author."""
4,one flaw,"this glue seems to work fine, the one down fall is that it has a plastic tip instead of a medal one. the medal ones being a bit better for modeling with both precition and ease of application"
3,Good glue!,"The glue works well and holds plastic modeling parts together almost immediately. I would advise buyers that they might need to cut off more of the tip than the package instructs in order for the glue to start flowing, and that by doing so the tip may not be as precise as the user might like."
1,Terrible Packaging for Glue,"I guess this was a defective bottle I could not get any glue to come out until I trimmed all of the applicator nozzle away. I cut it back a little at a time until I was all the way to the base and yes I did use the supplied wire to attempt to poke holes as I went, in the end I decided to dispose of this poor product packaging glue and all rather than try to ship a big mess back. I recommend anyone seeking to buy this stuff to do so locally if you can, that way if this happens to you, you can return it."
5,Excellent product,I love this stuff. The 4 different grits work well for whatever need for your cue. I use it when I get a ding on my cue and it takes it out every time. Since these are plastic you can wash and reuse them several times. I will definitely buy again.
1,REALLY BAD,Someone told me to use this product becuase it helps your hair grow at a faster rate. Well after using it for 6 months YES I did notice my hair grew a little but because of this product I had REALLY BAD acne on my face. Really bad acne!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!As soon as I stopped using this product the acne dissappeared like it was never there. I learned my lesson- NEVER AGAIN!!
1,SINDY,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER A MONTH AND HAVE NOT SEEN A DIFFERNCE IN MY HAIR. MAYBE, BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY YOU NEED TO WASH YOU HAIR EVERYDAY ?!?!? WOULDN'T WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY DRY AND FRIZZ YOUR HAIR. ANYHOW, I WILL NOT SPEND MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
4,This product really works,I have been using this product for a year now and my hair has almost doubled in length. The shampoo does not cut through the oils in my hair so I just use a cheaper shampoo and then use this one. The conditioner is absolutely fabulous. It makes my hair very soft and silky. I love this product.
4,"""I'm no different from you""","I'm no different from you is a reccuring line you'll here throughout the film as Fini Straubinger (who I guess would come closest to being the protagonist) tries to connect with other deaf & blind handicaps. Yet that same line is something that struck me strongly as I noticed how certain myths and preconceptions about the deaf & blind were brought to light by the film. They were truly no different from you or I despite the handicap they had. In fact the only thing that really held these people back from living normally was society and even family. Overall the film was very informative to say at the least, it's best to watch this viewing experience brought by Werner Herzog yourself and see a different side to the Land of Darkness and Silence."
4,Magnificent,"Herzog said in an interview that he made this for 3,000 dollars. He then said that everyone should make at least one film. I can't make this particular film, but I wish I had. This is something that anyone and everyone can learn something from. Communication is something we would all be lost without. And that alone is something worth considering."
5,A profound documentary,"This documentary was screened in my film class and when it ended, there was a heavy silence in the room. Several people wiped their eyes. It's a powerful film that shows how isolated life is for those who are blind and deaf, which many people may not be able to imagine. Herzog captures this with honesty and compassion. My admiration for Herzog became awe after watching this film and I bought it to share with my family and friends. At the very least, it inspires gratitude for the gifts of sight and sound and an awareness of what life might be like without them."
5,Album Title truly Apropo - Exotic Music Sizzles,"This CD sounds better each time I play it. The mix of percussions and violin add a wonderful flavor to their music. Only these two masters could blend Latin and Middle-eastern styles so harmoniously. Sounds unusual? Get this CD, you won't regret it."
2,Easy food,"Easy food. Warm, soft, fat, sweet, sour, hearty. Easy to swallow, no tastebuds or chewing required. I will not say hamburgers cannot be good. But if you tasted the real food from other albums, to my taste this CD is utterly unsatisfying.Another reviewer wrote: ""Strunz and Farah's fusion of middle eastern sounds with flamenco, jazz, rock and latin elements reached its zenith on ""Frontera."" It went downhill from here, though very gradually."" While there are real gems to be found on almost each CD (I own them all), in general I fully agree with him. The big 'M' vs SlowFood..."
4,Nice Warm Chill,I've had this disc for a while now and it continues to stay towards the top of my listening list. This is a great album for the background of a dinner party... or the foreground of a chill session. Either way it works and collects together a nice variety of influences and warm smooth moods. SF DJ Tom Thump really does a nice job.
1,SPOILED PINK FLOOR MATS,"I AM VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THE FLOOR MATS. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME COLOR AS THE KEY RING, STERRING WHEEL COVER OR THE TAG FRAME.THE FLOOR MATS ARE A DULL PALE PINK AND THE OTHER STUFF IS A PRETTY BRIGHT PINK. IT WAS GOING TO BE A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTERS FIRST CAR SO I WAS DISAPOINTED.I WILL RETURN THIS ITEM AND NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.MY COWORKER WANTED THIS FOR HER DAUGHTER BUT I WILL TELL HER NOT TO GET IT."
4,Grands Loved It,"Since these were the President daughters' toys, I just had to buy them for my Grands. They were an absolute hit!"
4,"Advanced, but terse",There is some great cutting edge stuff in here. If you know what you are doing already and want to get a jump start into Ajax then this is a good book for you. My problem with it is that the text relies too heavily on the code to convey the message. Which means that the book is better for advanced readers. I also would have appreciated some more emphasis on what works cross browser and how to handle older browsers.
1,Old video,The guy is writing in an unreadable transparency. Unbelievable that they try to sell this old video by 99 dolars. The charts are writen by hand in a transparency!!!!
4,great setup,"this is a cheap yet great sound setup for any room, i have this on a small room 4x4 the sound of the subwoofer can be heard and feel anywhere in the room, is perfect to hear music or movies and the regular Tv signal never sound better"
5,Essential reading,"I read while in a very dark place. And indeed it did give me hope. It shows that the way for survival in this world, where corporate greed seems to dominate, is to take what is given to us and make it a better place for others. Many of these stories are so inspirational that it takes away any excuse not to start one's own campaign to save the world."
4,A great book!,"I haven't completed the book yet, but so far it's been really good! I think the way she wrote it (from a child's view) was a really good idea, and it made it even more interesting! I loved the idea of traveling all over Europe and into North Africa...."
3,An interesting read!,"I read this engaging story, set in Marrakech, before I visited the city earlier in the year and it helped to give me a feel for the place. Although set in the 70s, this novel described the architecture, the atmosphere and the hustle and bustle that is very evident today. Maybe some of the novel's characters are still there, swapping stories in the square or selling fruit and vegetables in the marketplace! This is a light and entertaining read which, in the end, perhaps says more about mother/child relationships that it does about Marrakech."
5,I Loved this book too much!,"My mum and I read this book before the movie came out and it was so good! I was very sad when it ended, Bilal is such a good character, I don't blame the girl for wishing he was her father. Esther Freud is a marvelous writer and everyone should read this book!"
3,not blown away,"I'm reading this book at the moment. I think it is written well, but there isn't much of a plot so far, and seeing as i'm nearly at the end, i don't think it will pick up soon. The story is told through the experiences of a young girl, traveling with her Mother around morocco. While at times you really do get a sense of the places and the people, its not as good as I expected. Actually I do find it a bit over-hyped and think there are better books out there. So in summary, not bad, but not riveting.If you like more action and plot, don't go for it. And if you like well written books that appeal to the senses, CHOCOLAT is miles better."
4,The Powerlessness of Children,"I have never read a novel which so accurately yet simply portrays the mind of a child facing a world in chaos. Ms. Freud never loses the voice of her 5 year old narrator who sees her mother's selfishness but is unable to become judgemental because her mother is the only flimsy piece of security she owns. An excellent book, both whimsical and heartbreaking. Read it before you become a parent!"
2,"Too Expensive, !","Not much use for this card, [the price] is too much for this card.get something less expensive, besides the upcoming Rodeon 9700 will be much better than this card it will run 340Mhz core 700Mhz DDR with 256Bit DDR unlike Nivida 128Bit.Don't waste your money on Geforce4"
5,Two Masterpieces,"These two masterpieces at a single dvd (""La jetee"" is, of course, a short film) will make a great purchase - additional material is all but non-existant but the films speak for themselves.The essay on time, perception, media, memory and human destiny (""Sans soleil"") and the poetic modernist SF (""La jetee""-that was, as you probably know, liberally remade by Terry Gilliam in ""12 monkeys"") are among the masterpieces of modernist cinema, not to be missed by any serious film buff.""La jetee"" is famous for its montage of stills, non-moving photographs, but viewers beware; not every shot is a still and this small deviation you should discover is just one example of Marker's subtlety."
4,La Jet,La JeteeBeautiful movie. Everything seems so timeless... you would never pinpoint it to be filmed (using all Man Ray photos) in 1923.A good thing to say about La Jetee is that it inspired Solyaris (1972).
3,Not as much fun as others,"My 20 month old daughter loves Eloise, she has since she was 1.My 4 year old son likes her too. We have 2 other DVDs. This one is ok, but it does get a little boring, or maybe it just goes over her head. I like Eloise as a night time DVD becaus the colors are more muted."
3,It's Okay...,"This Eloise movie is okay, not nearly as good as Me, Eloise. The kids still enjoy it, though."
5,thanks>,"I really don't like having to write a review, every time I buy something! this is rediculous to review every time I buy something!"
5,Outstanding,"I'm two generations removed from this duo, almost 70. But this entire album absolutely rocks. When I go out for my walk every morning I have Episode II playing on my little sansa and I have to stop and rock out from time to time. And the orchestral version of Adagio is surreal."
4,good,"this album is really good to start with but then slow's down abit, the track ""played-a-live""(the bongo song) is the best track along with SAMB-ADAGIO and ADAGIO.if you where to buy this album or there second album ""3.0"" then i would say buy this one."
5,The Most Amazing Dawn Book !,"This new Dawn book is a must have for the Dawn collector! Even if you are just starting out, you should see this book. You will find this book to have large and clear photos. Very helpful to see details! The author shares her amazing collection and has some unique hard to find and variations. Other books did not do justice to Dawn dolls. I find myself scanning this book over and over. The price guide is pretty accurate in helping you seek out these lovely ladies. Thank you for sharing your collection with us Benita Schwartz!"
5,Valuation Mathematics,"This book is good for people who is new to the real property investment. This is for beginner level only,however, it does offer the basic formula of various type of valuation mathematic."
3,English Pound notation is great if your working in England,I ordered the book as a guide for refreshing some equations and methods in the income approach that I use for reports. The book is very comprehensive and useful ....except that it is noted in the Pound system which is distracting when read.
1,Skip Skip Skip the Skip Dr.,"This unit fails in it's main function. To repairAfter following close attention to the directions I now ownthe movie "" Cast Away "" that I must ""Toss Away "" It onlyhad a few skips. Now it's completely useless. I will try tocontact the manufacturer for reimbursement of my movieconsidering Sears already is reselling the unit........"
1,"Skip Doctor, you owe me a game...","Not only does this product not work as advertised, but it also scratched my copy of Madden 2006 beyond repair. The design is atrociously bad, and as the last reviewer noted, the wheel design is so flimsy that it doesn't spin without bending, and the CD needs to be helped by hand in order to spin. I am returning this piece of crap tomorrow. Stay FAR AWAY from Skip Dr. products!"
4,Great Little Gadget,"We rent DVDs from www.Blockbuster.comand every once in a while, you're in the middle of a movie and all of a sudden it starts breaking up.OOOOOHHHH NOOOOOOOwe HATED thatbut now, we just pop the DVD in the AODR gadget and VOILA !!!good as newDVD plays great.I LOVE this thing !!!!Linda"
5,El Oso,"The movie was everything I hoped it would be; drama, pathos and comedy!I especially liked that it had English subtitles for the little bit of human conversation, but that it largely was a non-speaking film.I WOULD NOT recommend this for young children since it had some particularly bloody scenes with 'injured' animals. This is definitely a GREAT story!"
4,Good one,This is a lil bit costly book but has very good information about the subject. Authors did a good job.
5,I would recommend this book to any diver.,"""Cuba Scuba is the first comprehensive guide to the Cuban diving scene. It is obvious Cuba Scuba offers not only a comprehensive listing of hotels, dive resorts and dive sites throughout the country, but also valuable information and insights for US Citizens who wish to experience Cuba legally and hassle free. I would recommend this book to any diver who is planning a visit to Cuba."""
2,La Strada fan,"Beware. If you're looking for another La Strada or Nights of Cabiria (both 5 big stars), City of Women is not it; nor is it 8 1/2 or La Dolce Vita or Juliet of the Spirits (at least 4 stars each). It is a collection of boisterous images that struggle to cohere and that mostly lack the charm of the forementioned screen gems.Even if you're desperate for more Fellini, you may want to avoid this one."
5,Eliquid,"This oil is great for creating your own eliquid. With this and just a touch of menthol, you get a flavor that is a perfect match to that of a clove cigarette. Flavor is great, so I guess it would be good for food to even though I didn't use it for that."
5,Love it,"I love the spicy, oriental scent of Lucky No. 6. The bottle is unique and it seems you get quite a lot in the bottle. Great for clubbing or a date!"
2,Was this always a Liz item?,"Find the scent very watered down from what I had been purchasing in the stores, don't think I will order again."
3,Not the same quality,"I use to purchase this product from the department store. They do not sell it anymore. The bottle I received from amazon was not the exact same fragrant as the department store parfume. This smells more of alcohol. It seems more watery or weak. The department store parfume felt more of an oil base and it last longer. I will keep it but will not buy parfume from here again. Customer service is excellent and I've ordered other things from here that were outstanding and Iam sure I will order other Items again, just not parfume."
5,Love it!,I love this perfume! It smells fresh. The perfume stays and it's pleasant. Not too strong. I highly recommend this.
1,Never delivered! Not refunded!,This package was paid for and never delivered and never refunded for! I have no access to the ups claim because they already filed and did not follow through! I will never purchase from them again and recoommend everyone else stay clear.
5,sex appeal,"this was a gift for a female friend. not only does she appreciate the fragrance, but i really appreciate it when she wears it also. great value for the money. i was the ""lucky"" one."
5,Beautiful Soft Fragrance,"THIS IS VERY NICE PERFUME. I first received it from my son's girlfriend because she received if from a friend but she doesn't wear perfume, so she asked me if I wanted to smell it and if I liked it, I could have it, but when I'm done she wants the beautiful bottle back. I loved the smell and I decided to buy another one for myself because the bottle she gave me is almost gone already. I wear it everyday. Thank you and Happy Holidays to you. Lorraine Linscott"
2,Scentless,"I was so looking forward to trying this perfume, and was truly disappointed. While it is known for being a ""light"" scent, the scent is practically non-existent. There's nothing there at all. It's such an attractive bottle too. It's not that I like heavy or overpowering fragrances, but I need to have something that I know is there. Maybe people around me will notice it, but so far, I have not. This may be the perfect scent for the office, enclosed quarters, because there is no way this scent will knock anyone out with a punch."
2,Decent at Best,"First of all, let me start by saying that the line of GF4MXs are built around the GF2 engine. That meaning that you won't get any of the new features the GF4Ti's bring. The card is decent for some games, but will have lots of trouble with newer games. I suggest you shell out another $$$ and get the GF4Ti4200, deffinately way better than this."
2,Worked Fine for 3 Months,"I have a nearly three year old Compaq which does not have any AGP ports, so I needed a PCI card to play the new Warcraft & Age of Mythology games I purchased in the fall. I wasn't looking for the greatest card, just one that would allow me to play the new games until the day (if there ever is one) that I can afford to get a new PC with better everything.Well, the card seemed to work fine.... for just over three months until it blipped out on me and started showing a multicolored screen. I took it into work and tried it on some other PC's... it was gone.I won't buy it again, but thank goodness I purchased it at Wal-Mart."
5,It makes us sound great!,"Behringer makes great stuff, affordably priced. The MDX2600 is an excellent example. After installing one in our church sound system, I purchased a second one for a band I play in. It is part of the audio processing chain in the gear we take on the road. We don't have a sound engineer riding levels out in the audience. The MDX2600 does that for us, and it makes us sound great! The best compliment I can give it is that you can't hear it. You don't realize it is there. The audience simply hears music that is consistently mixed with the correct balance of instruments and vocals. That is difficult to maintain given all the variables of live performances at different venues. The MDX2600 gets it done, effortlessly."
4,Aquarium glass scraper,"I've been looking everywhere for something to reach the bottom of my aquarium and have finally found it. This is a strong and sturdy scraper, with a flexible blade, which surprisingly isn't too sharp. However, it works extrememly well, even on stubborn coraline."
4,Great,"Shipped the next day! algae pad + rotating head works well on hard to reach places in our tall, skinny custom-built acrylic tank."
3,still had streaks...after use,"Followed the directions, still had streaks. Figured still dirty. So wet window/ washed with cleaning pad/ rinsed/ rinsed and it looked good. Until the next morning with the sun shining threw. Not so streak free... Is there any thing that can be done?"
2,Weak,"The handle is very weak. So if you need to do any scrubbing, I would suggest getting something with a stronger pole."
3,Disappointed in the color,"I ordered this based on the reviews of the black serving set, saying it was nice and shiny. I am very disappointed the cherry color does not ""pop"" and shout fun like it is pictured. Color is closer to a brick red. I decided to spend extra on this serving set just based on the fun color aspect."
3,If you have a MAC OSX,"This is a good game, but one word of caution......If you have MAC OSX and not OS9, you need to download a font called New York 18, or else the program won't run. You cannot find this download free anywhere, but it's possible to ask friends who have OS 9 capabilities on their computer to let you download the font onto a CD and then transfer it to your own computer. That's what we had to do to get the Oregon Trail part to run. The Liberty Kids part of the whole game is good, too."
4,Excellent product,"These days, it's simply not enough to lose weight...we want to lose FAT.This device relies upon you to accurately measure and input your height and weight, just like any other such device.The interface is extremely easy, it stores measuring data for up to five people, and the clock/alarm function allows you to set a reminder so you measure every day without any ""oops.""My only complaint is that it does not store your measurements over time so that you can see your progress, but that's what Excel spreadsheets are for ;)"
5,STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THE RESULTS!!!!,I have had dandruff all my life. I have tried every product including prescription ones and have never gotten the results as with this. I am dandruff free!!!! Love it...
5,"Finally, a product for conditions other than dandruff!","I ordered this product NOT because I have dandruff (I don't) but rather because it also treats other scalp conditions such as itching, rash and zits. I have been plagued with an extremely itchy scalp and severe breakouts for years. This product contains 2% salicylic acid which I am hoping will resolve the itching and scalp pimples. My product arrived yesterday, I used it last night....and blissfully drifted off to sleep with nary an itch. So far I am impressed....it smells good and seems to do the trick."
3,Mediocre and Half-Hearted,"Based on the glowing praise from other reviewers, I was expecting something wonderful when I ordered this book. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver.To be fair, there are two or three essays that give interesting historical or biographical insights into Wells' work. But these little gems hardly make up for all the self-indulgent, aimless, fuzzy writing that fills most of the book. Where was the editor?Advice: Check this out of a library, or browse through it at a bookstore. It's not worth paying for..."
4,Goog bargain,Good buy that met my expectation. The product is basic and your money is good. This working fine. Thanks acquisition.
4,The Book of Teddy Bear Making by Gillian Morgan,"The most informative teddy bear making book I have every read. There is one flaw however, George Thomas (bear) is missing his tummy in the pattern section on page 184."
1,Incomplete Book !,"I found the instructions for some of the non-standard patterns are hard to follow and leave out very important information. Also, a number of the patterns are incomplete. The pattern layouts made it very very difficult to photocopy. The book requires us to enlarge the patterns, and they are too large to begin with, making it hard to do, unless you pay for special printing services. They should include the complete and full size patterns !!"
4,More than a collection of love poetry...,"Sometimes honed, sometimes raw, Mr. Finnie's poetry is always perceptive, and offers colorful glimpses of life as seen through the eyes of an artist as a young man. His verse captures subjects (usually female) and images in settings ranging from a 19th century French café to 20th century metropolitan New York, and the reader senses Mr. Finnie's passion for everything from high Andean mountain climbing to the pure beauty of raindrops as they fall onto the page and take the form of a simple haiku. This book is more than it's subtitle implies (Selected Love Poems) and I highly recommend it."
5,"Just as envisioned, works great.","I received the box with the toner cartridge from UPS this afternoon. It was a Lexmark branded box and cartridge, just as the picture showed. I opened it up, follow the (simple) directions and installed it in my Lexmark C534 Printer without a hitch. I closed the doors on the printer, immediately the printer recognized the new toner cartridge. The printer went through a 60 second calibration process (I hadn't printed yet today, no black toner!). I selected one of the internal printer reports to print, second later out came a crisp sheet of paper with the black perfectly printer.What more can you say? Works great, we'll see how long it last but for now, it's just as I expected."
4,ink came fast,bought product for someone and they did not complain so I guess it works fine.. Product came very fast good service.
2,Prevue Pet Products Cosmic Glow in the Dark Crunch Bird Hut,"I had heard wonderful things about cocanut huts so I bought my lovie and parrotlete one each. The parrotlete will not even go near the crunch hut, and my lovie will only stand on top of it."
1,Dangerous,"My VS 526 was working great until one day I noticed the chord started getting extremely hot. Two weeks later, it began getting even hotter. And just about ten minutes ago, it popped in my hand. There was huge spark and loud pop, and I am shocked I wasn't burned. I am so thankful for that that it even made come here and write this review. Please be very careful."
1,Very dangerous hair dryer,"My wife had this hair dryer for years and it worked perfectly well until just recently (9/12). A few weeks ago she used it to dry her hair, turned it off and placed it on the sink counter as she has always done. About one hour later we heard it, completely on its own, start running at a very high speed for about 10 seconds and then stop. By the time I entered the bathroom to see what was going on I could detect the very strong odor of a burnt electrical device. I discoverd the very hot hair dryer on the sink counter and the counter top scorched black. This thing could have started a fire! If you have one I suggest you dispose of it immediately before it burns down your house."
5,VIDAL SASSON VS 526 COMPACT TRAVEL DRYER,This hairdryer dries my hair faster than any I have ever used. The fact that it is lightweight and inexpensive as well is a bonus. The dual voltage feature is really great if you travel to other countries. I love the fact that it is so lightweight and folds for storage. AI would definitely recommend this hairdryer.
2,Disappointed,"I just broke my VS hair dryer that I had for a couple of years so I was happy to find this model on Amazon. However, it just doesn't work as well as my old one. The low setting is not hot enough so my hair ends up frizzing. If I use the high setting it blows the breaker. It's going back."
5,Good stuff,"I think that the Learn Through Music Plus is a great toy, in fact, probably one of the only toys my daughter will play with for more than 1 minute. I'd say it's one of her favorites, the Ariel Rom is very cute and she likes it a lot, but she doesn't like it as much as Dora. I'd recommend it though."
1,Broken,It was broken. I shipped back and tomy knowledge I have not been notified that I have been reimbursed for it .
1,Defective Produce,I received the product damaged - it didn't work. I went through the procedures for returning the product and sent it UPS. I asked for a replacement. Still haven't received one as of July 12th 2010.
1,Now here this and everything else,"As I open the box this thing looks great and I cant wait to try it out. After I add power I can here all kinds of stuff - like my hand on the handle, my finger on the trigger, the birds somewhere, my heart beating through the grip,my breathing,a car behind me somewhere,the wind or someone talking oh yea that's what I wanted to here--no those are the wrong people they sound like a cat fight oh that is a cat fight, wait I think I hear someone walking up behind me---oops I fluffed, yea this thing smells, too.Not a Good Buy just a waste. Just a listen to your self device.NEXT!"
1,not to my satisfaction,I recieved my order yesterday and used it but it wasnt to my satisfaction.I was hoping to listen to a great deal of things but i tried everything and couldnt get much out of the product.
1,Not worth it...,The item itself is okay. I can't tell if the scope is worth anything because it arrived damaged. The real problem is the seller TechJam USA. There is no direct number to call and they don't return any of my emails.
1,"Unfortunately, it arrived damaged","I ordered this item a few weeks ago. It finally arrived today. Open the box and the parabolic dish was broken. So no opportunity to test this device. I wanted another one from Amazon. However,the only option was to refund my money. I may order another one and give it one more try."
2,"Fun for kids in the house ONLY, they had to point it exactly when outside and even then barely heard person....",Did not work very well. My son enjoyed using it in the house but when we measured out the distance unless it was directed exactly at his sister it could barely hear what she was saying but he had fun in the house overhearing his sister as long as it was very quiet.
3,convenient but dim,"Pro: has an extra socket on the side. Convenient switch on top. Flash mode can greatly extend battery life.Con: takes up a lot of space, and the light is dimmer than the common in-house night light. If the battery stays normally charged, then the battery life suffers so it won't stay on quite as long as one might expect. I find the connection to the car's socket to be poor: my car keeps pushing it out."
3,"Good, But not as good as the ""cheese"" version","The dogs went crazy and love the cheese versions of these, which are less available. We bought these in an effort to give them alternative, which would also provide them with better breath. They are willing to eat them sparingly. It is nothing like their fondness for the cheese version of this product, which is also tarter reducing."
1,Universal Brake Hose Bracket - requires workaround,"I purchased a pair of these for my Geo Metro; after installation, I noticed that there was no way to affix the brake hose retainer clip because the bracket on these struts is centered on the cylinder of the strut; stock struts have the bracket offset, so there is a unique part number for the left & right struts.I contacted Monroe, but they have no record of this 801918 part number.I was advised that a piece of oil-resistant hose could be wrapped around the brake hose, fit into the bracket, and secured with a tywrap, but I opted to remove these struts and purchase KYB's, which have the properly located bracket (clue is unique part number for left & right struts).I was able to resell these Monroe's to someone who didn't mind the workaround, but I think that Amazon should note this oddity for these struts."
3,Good Study,I have not started the study as of this time. We are completing the study of Daniel and then will begin Judges. I will come back on at a later date.
5,A Great Collection,Bright upbeat tunes in this collection of disposable music. Be glad someone thought to save it for us. I've made a personal compilation from Popshopping 1 & 2 and find it to be ideal highway driving music- a perfect balance of pop beats and smooth melodies. Guaranteed to brighten your day. And advertising executives could learn a few things about sticking their product in the consumer's mind from this disc.
1,Though used it wasn't clear it was a first edition from 1978. 8th edition is latest.,Though used it wasn't clear it was a first edition from 1978. 8th edition is latest. The thumbnail display for instance is of the recent text not the 35 year old copy I was sold.
4,Wonderful story,Di Morrissey is a born story teller.I find her books hard to put down Can never predict hoe the story will end. The story of the station was very real and left one feeling that they were there
5,Barra Creek,"I found this book catching from the Start. Di Morrissey has the talent of describing the life on a Station in the Creek Country. When I read the Book I could picture the places, the people and harshness and beauty of the country."
2,Long and boring,"While I did enjoy the descriptions of life on the cattle station at the time, I got so bored by the middle of the book I just skimmed the second half. The author gives away all the important plot points in advance, so you know roughly what's coming, and then there's just way too much detailed descriptiveness to get there."
1,Breaks after one year!,"Bought one of these a year ago. Worked well for a while, changed the filter twice. The second time it started leaking everywhere! (yes I double-checked the installation).The filter is now unusable, so I had to trash both the system and one perfectly good filter as I'm NEVER buying PUR again. I went with Britta... let's hope they're not as bad as this."
1,Misleading,The description fails to mention that this does not include the actual book and is marked up with highlighters. I am very disappointed and will have to throw it in the trash. Too bad I can't afford to order the book now that I'm out for the cliff notes I didn't want.
1,THE WRONG BOOK,"I ordered THE HANDMAID'S TALE, but was sent a book of reviews, questions, etc. about the book, but not the text. The book was from Britain. I wrote Amazon about the mistake, but got no reply. This mistake was unusual, but since I needed the text for a book club review, it was useless. I'm paying for a book I did not order. Mary Wilder"
5,Are you ready?,"So you're thinking about reading more than a label? I ask you one question.>>Why havent you already read it?This book is a must read for everyones list. After reading the first chapter, your eyes will have been opened. You will see the impact that labels have had on so many individuals, and on our society collectively.My suggestion to everyone; pick up a copy of this book, read it, and learn something from it. We all have a long way to go, but this book is the key to a step in the right direction. Spread the word!"
3,Great Series. Poor DVD production.,"A wonderful series, but as previously mentioned, the film quality is so-so, and no captions makes it an inferior product. It's like paying for wood and getting formica. Why even bother if you can't do it right?"
3,Agatha Christie's Poirot The Classic Collection,"The stories are good, the filmimg is good, the acting is good; the problem is David Suchet often speaks his lines in almost a whisper and there is no captioning. Captioning would solve the problem. The actor is British, an accent I have trouble with to begin, and then he is imitating a French Belgian accent speaking softly. I have to turn up the volume so loud that if we had neighbors I'm sure they would complain."
1,If only all the DVD's worked!,I love Hercule Poirot and so I splurged on this collection....sadly I did not know that you had to check every DVD in the set (there is 12) within 30 days or you're out of luck. Unfortunately 3 of the 12 DVD's will not work and I am 10 days (more or less) too late finding this out. I will have to seriously think twice before buying from Amazon again. This is less than satisfactory to say the least!
4,"Great to have a good friend at home, but he does not look as good as he should!","I am very pleased with this set EXCEPT that the video quality is barely at VHS level.I cannot imagine what this collection would look like on an HDTV set.If you must have all of your favorite David Suchet Poirot episodes in one easy to handle set, this is it... but be warned....you had better turn up the contrast and lower the picture brightness on your TV."
5,Great mind excercising entertainment.,"Love the stimulation, and concentration needed, to follow the ""story or plot."" We especially enjoy the period authenticity of the sets and dress. The eccentricities of H. Poirot, e.g., ""two soft boiled eggs each of the same size"" and immaculate, fastidiousness of dress are particularly endearing.We enjoy the series and can easily rewatch an episode since there are so many.Thanks Mr. Poirot for many enjoyable hours of entertainment.Marlene & Karl Kabza"
5,A must read!,"This isn't a how to clean your house book. It helps change the way you think, so that you WANT to clean your house!"
5,Flylady Baby~,"This book was absolutely a joy to read ~ and as depressed as I am about my house right now, I do see hope..LOL! Easy to read and you just don't want to put it down. A+++++"
5,Sink Reflections,"This is worth the purchase. I have a ton of organizational books. She makes you feel like a friend. If you slip up on your routines that's OK, just start again."
4,Flylady's easy house & home organizing,"This book is great for starting anad maintaining a personalized housekeeping routine because you can start with ""baby steps""; it also allows for flexibility to fit anyone's circumstances and lifestyle.Sink Reflections"
5,Give yourself a break and get it together!,"A positive, practical way to love yourself and bring order to your daily world. It's a simple approach, that does not cling to hard and fast rules. It will give you practical ideas and practical ways to implement them, if you choose to do so. Always encouraging you along the way, the ideas for organizing your home and cleaning routines spill over into everyday life. It's about attitude, baby steps, and caring for yourself enough to make positive changes. Sprinkled with humor, first hand accounts of ""then and now"", and reader responses with results. It's a short read that you'll refer to time and again."
5,LOVE CLEANING AND HAVE MORE TIME FOR YOU!,"Although, I successfully teach how to get kids to complete their chores smiling... I never believed that cleaning a sink could be SO enjoyable... that is until now! Marla, brings fun back into the cleaning equation and offers simple step-by-step strategies WHILE providing fantastic support. Marla also, accomplished the impossible - she made a book on cleaning a book that you just won't be able to put down!"
3,"So-so book, website is better","After becoming familiar with the...user group, I looked forward to reading Marla Cilley's book. However, I was disappointed to find that much of the book content was on the website or contained in the user group reminders. On a positive note, Cilley's cleaning ""style"" is refreshing, unpretentious, and worthwhile. I use some of her suggestions daily."
3,"Clean with Jesus, Loving Subjugated Wife","I use Cilley's methods and it's made a tremendous difference -- that woman really knows how to keep a house. You just have to be willing to overlook all the gushing about ""God breezes"" and ""purple puddles"" and how nothin' says lovin' like a clean toilet. I get the impression Cilley lives in a world that's so deeply Christian-Mom that she really doesn't know other kinds of people clean their houses. I know people call her on the subject, and I don't know whether this ""clean your house with Jesus power"" thing persists because she really doesn't know how to break out of it, or because she doesn't want to recognize a world where men clean houses, women have reasonably egalitarian marriages and interests that rival home and family, and non-Christians walk the earth."
5,Flylady is excellent!,"Flylady is wonderful. In simple, easy steps, she guides us to getting our houses (or apatments, in my case) clean and organized and de-cluttered. A little at a time, start small and slowly add to your routine. It's great. None of this 'all at once' stuff we all feel we need to do. As I've followed her, I've found that my apartment stays neat and clean, and I hardly feel like I'm doing anything at all. I'm a lifetime messy, so my apartment being clean for more than a few days is a record. Thank you, Flylady!"
5,Flylady changed my life and saved my marriage!,"I am a Flylady missionary! flylady is hard to explain, but it's about FINALLY LOVING YOURSELF And using small routines to keep your home clean and decluttered- and by extension, your life calm and peaceful. Flylady's calm and encouraging way is just whatyou need- if this program world to keep the DUGGAR house clean it will work for you too!"
3,Didn't do much for me,"To be fair, this is probably a good book for anyone who has not read the Sidetracked Home Executives. I guess my mistake was that I read the Sidetracked Home Executives book first and so scrubbing my kitchen sink every day didn't really make me feel any better. My kitchen sink was always clean since doing the dishes and cleaning the sink were already done once I had finished my cards every day.Although not near as funny and entertaining as the S.H.E books, this is still a great book for people who just want a starting point to cleaning up the clutter in their homes."
4,"Helpful, but I can do without the pointless Christianity...","The author borrows liberally from people who pioneered organizational systems -- at least, unlike many others, FlyLady openly admits where she got her ideas and inspirations. It is always refreshing to read a self-help author with a conscience. I am subtracting one star, because as helpful as this book is to people like myself, who run flat out into the wall of their own perfectionism, all the references to 'God' are annoying, distracting and, as far as I can tell, yet another bit of Christian propaganda in a society that is already swarming with Christians and New Agers. This unsavory bit of smarm has actually caused me to *dislike* an otherwise good book. 'God breezes', thanking God. WHOSE God, might I ask? Enough, already."
1,Not impressed...,"I was not impressed with Sink Reflections. I found it dull, not well written, and not at all useful. I felt much of the information presented in the book was taken from Pam Young and Peggy Jones SHE system. Let the backlash begin!!!"
1,Can't Recommend,"This book does not have good information concerning clutter control or organization. This book is geared toward very depressed individuals who need someone to hold their hand and cheerlead them into getting it together. If you need information on cleaning (products, how-to, etc.), I recommend No Time To Clean, by Don Aslett."
1,Greatest book every written???,"Usually that type of rhetoric is saved for religious texts. the previous reviewer might want to reconsider her hyperbole. This is just a book of housecleaning and home organizing tips, although the author has seen fit to sprinkle in more than a liberal dose of adulation allegedly written by her adoring fans. And therein lies part of the problem: too much space dedicated to self-aggrandizing. If you want this type of thing, why buy the book? You can get it for free on her website, which by the way, also advertises a whole host of home organizing products, turning house-cleaning into a religious industry. In another culture, she'd have everyone screaming ""Jihad on Clutter!"" How does becoming so mindlessly sloganized help you get your life organized? With so many other books on this topic, it's a safe bet you could take a chance with any one of them and get a better book."
4,Glorified Housework,"I follow the FLYLADY e-mails and her web site. I've ordered several products from her, so I thought...why don't I have her book? It's still housework, but she turns the attitude around into ""home blessings."" She is very enthusiastic, up-beat with a terrific positive attitude. Her book has inspired me even more to keep my head up and my shoes on. I'd give the book 5 stars, but, it's still housework."
4,"Great starting point, if you are a complete hot mess","If you are like me a complete mess, this book and her website are amazing starting points. I am not religious, but spiritual so I just instead of being offended by saying like god breezes think spirit breezes instead. Not keen on the shoe thing b/c my ankles swell a lot especially if I have been working all day.But for some reason the shiny sink thing really does work.It does help create a starting point to de-cluttering. I have a super short attention span so the 15 thing is excellent.I probably wouldn't buy the book, I borrowed from the library and the information is available on her website."
5,Fly Lady Rocks!!,I discovered Marla Cilly from an email sent to me by my mother after a desparate phone call. I was drowning. Working 10 hours per day 5 days per week with three kids made housework more than I could handle. Adopting the routines in this book have made my house presentable not perfect. Many thanks for giving me my life back!!
4,this is a good book,I haven't completed the book yet but I'm more than halfway through it and so far I like it. I'm not doing everything that it says but at least it has given me ideas. One of my really good friends swears by it.
4,The book is good the website is better.,"To those who have negatively reviewed this book...you just don't understand. This is not your standard organize-it or how-to-clean book. It is unique and down to earth. If you are looking for a reference book look elsewhere. If you're looking for something down to earth...you'll find it here. Marla helps you understand your chaos and what to do about it. If your house is perfect, you really don't need this book. This ""system"" is excellent for those with ADD, Depression, etc, I know.The website offers all this and more with options for daily e-mails. Some of us weren't taught to check the medicine cabinet for expiration dates, clean out the refridgerator, or pay the bills on time. Here is someone to teach us how. To those who slam the lace-up shoes and shiny sink...have you tried it, or just tossed the baby out with the bath water?"
4,Great Book,"This is a great book and a great system. I recommend Flylady.net to anyone I can. Her system works. But just like any system it only works if you use. If you're going to sit there and whine nothing will change. When your truly ready for a change in your home and your life, order this book. Otherwise it will only add to your clutter."
5,"Helpful, useful, entertaining book","Great book, very inspiring. Just pick up and read any passage. easy reader, Don't have to read from front to back to get started organizing your life! love the what to pack for your trip list. and other useful tips."
5,FlyLady is my hero!,"My house is 200 times better off and it all started with this book! Read it and shine your sink...you will be able to pat yourself on the back for something good you did in your house. It all starts with having the guts to admit you're not a bad person because your house is messy. Then DO SOMETHING! Throw out 1 piece of junk mail. Then sit down and watch TV. You did something. Try it, FlyLady is well worth your time."
5,FlyLady Rocks!!,"Absolutely love this book. I live in chaos, the book hasn't solved that - but when I implement the tips/tricks Flylady provides in this book, life is easier and less chaotic! She is just a positive influence on life, follow her on facebook, she makes me smile/laugh at least once a day!"
3,Its all on the Website,"I love the ""Flylady"" and her system. I was introduced to her this summer (6mo ago) and have been visiting her website and getting her daily emails. I found the book contained almost the same info as I had been getting for FREE online. I recommend going to the website and save your money. Her whole plan is babysteps. I like how the babysteps are presented online better. I don't have the time to read the book and then try to implement the ideas."
3,"Good theory, but the book needs work","I've spent time on the Flylady web site, and for a period of time received her email reminders. I thought perhaps the book would help me create my own reminders, based on my schedule, and give me a hard copy of the information on her web site.It does that, however it is full of typos, poor grammar, and is extremely poorly edited. I am consistently disappointed to see her books, as well as Leanne Ely's, published in such an amateur way.I also must add my agreement with another poster regarding the website and many of the ""reminders"" you receive with her system. It seems to be one fawning advertisement for her products after another. You can accomplish the same results with other dusters, other timers, other sink plugs, other calendars. That adds to my overall disappointment with the books and the system."
5,A great method to overcome the clutter!,"This book is great! A quick read, with tons of hope and help. The FlyLady has a 'Down to Earth' writing style which makes this book so much fun to read--you can't wait to get started! It is very motivating and uplifting! You won't be sorry if you get this book--it is a great tool for getting yourself together!"
5,Sink Reflections,"For the past few years I have read many books on getting organized, decluttering, and the like. This is the ONLY book that has given me the information I needed to get my house in order. After reading this book, my house is literally 100% more organized than ever before, and I have taken all my other decluttering books and thrown them out! They were only making clutter, and clutter was what I was trying to get rid of.A must read for anyone who wants once and for all to get the CHAOS (can't have anyone over syndrome) out of their lives and really start to live!"
4,Boy do I need this book!!,"I am starting to FLY, babysteps, but it is a beginning. It is way too fun! Can't wait to get on the live blog."
4,Hardworking Feminist Mom LOVES this book and author,"We've been 'flying' at work and home for a year now and I would encourage anyone who is buried with too much to do and NO HELP to get on the flylady bandwagon. This is not a book about how to clean your house, although she DOES get you moving in that direction. Marla really is writing about changing our attitudes from resentment (poor me, Pity party) to joy. AND she succeeds! I had really been struggling with running my own business and my household and organizing 3 kids and a husband - and I was getting quite annoyed about a number of things. Marla reminded me of what I have to celebrate - and feminist that I am, I still can roll up my sleeves and clean a toilet with a smile. THIS IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT!"
2,"BEWARE of Shrill, Mean, Preachy Tone: Yes, Exactly!","I deliberately ""borrowed"" the title of my review for this book, because I completely agreed with another reader who noted that the ""tone"" of the book comes across both as preachy (with some suspect religious overtones) and shrill. Worse, there are times when the author seems to berate the reader, and this is where the ""mean"" designation comes in.What about the rest of the content? Well, if you really need a book to tell you to empty your trash and clean your sink, then I guess this might be the book for you. But for this reader, that info. was just a little TOO basic.I would have preferred some organizing tips that addressed concerns for working women, women with un-cooperative husbands, etc. (It seems all the women who are ""flybabies"" have DH's, aka: Darling Husbands.)As another reader noted, the book seemed to be aimed at those who are very depressed, and need daily motivation to just get dressed and get moving.[...]Good luck!"
5,CHAOS BE GONE!!,"First of all love this book! It lets me know that I am not the only Sidetracked House Executive (also known as SHE). Great tips!! Still working on it, but it has got me flying in the right direction!!"
3,Phoenix wing earings,I was not as pleased with these earrings as I was with the matching pendant because they were so very small. Still they are very pretty earrings and my wife was pleased with them.....
4,phoenix earings,"Small earings but a nice size, not big or gaudy at all. Great quality, as pictured... got these along with the pendant which is also nicely made."
2,I am annoyed by characters like this,It is not amusing and I don't admire people who think they know more than authorities and withhold materials and information that are germane to an investigation because they think they are smarter than the police or other authorities.Perhaps it makes for a longer story but it simply annoys me. I bought two stories by this author. Read the first one all the way through thinking that it would get better but was disappointed in the end.The second one (this title) I managed to get through half way and gave up because yet again the protagonist held back information that would have averted much of the damage to other people.I won't buy another.
4,Fun little player.,"I have had the IKTV player for about 3 years now and it sill works well. It can be a bit fussy sometimes taking multiple loads to read a disc though.2 things stand out for this system;1) It is from a company that is VCD based in it's format, not CD+G. So if you have a bunch of the U-Best discs, you might not be able to take them with you to Karaoke at the local pub or friends house if you are in the United States (Region 1 dvd code). American markets is Cd+g based and I would say it is a toss up as to whether a CD+G system will read these discs. Depends on the model and most VJ's will probably not know.which is a shame because2) Theses discs are not just words on a screen, they are short films depicting the songs. Similar to the old Laserdisc systems. Pretty high quality stuff. Much more entertaining than the basic words on a blue screen."
4,Its the best available,I played this for my 16 year old daughter who is taking guitar lessons and her jaw dropped to the ground. I had forgotten what a great guitarist Alvin Lee is and what a together band Ten Years After was.If they are still around they should get back together and do a tour.This DVD really shows the talent of Lee and the entire band. I gave it only 4 stars because of its short length. There is a lot of hits not on it but the ones that are are just awsome.If you are a lover of guitar rock this is a must dvd to have in your collection.
5,excellent,very happy with the way it was sent and the quickness in which it arrived .........thanks again
3,Pasos del Milenio,"Se extraña la salsa en la voz del principe... pero a los que nos gusta una buena letra y un buen interprete, este trabajo debe estar lleno de sentimiento y toques de locura... ojala lo podamos escuchar y tener pronto"
3,Could be much better,"I love the show and I am a big fan of Eden's Crush, so there was no question that I was going to buy the CD when it came out. I read some reviews before hand, but tried to keep an open mind. I have to say that I think the group got the short end of the stick with only making 7 new songs, especially when EC got like 13. The songs are good, but the CD is very short. The interludes are ok to listen to, they have good background music, but they are also very short. The extra songs are ok, but nothing special since they are a few years old mostly. I know I probably won't listen to the extra songs. I think the group has potential and if they get to use their own creative juices then I think they could be look. It'll be interesting to see what happens when the single comes out. Bottom line, if you like pop music and are a fan of the show then you'll probably enjoy the cd, but don't be disapointed when it's only a half an hour long."
5,The Best,I really liked the cd I thought it had great traks on it and I loved the fact that you could pop it into your computer and see all different kinds of things. I really like Scene 23 and would buy this item for all of my friends. It is the only thing in my cd player.
2,What a Joke!!!,"Ok first off when you look at the track listings you normaly count the number of songs, right?? Yea, well this one says that they sing 8 of the 14 songs on the CD and the other 6 are by other original artists. Ok well the truth is that they, Scene 23, only sings 7 songs track # 1 is a bunch of different people saying ""Popstar"" as for the other 6 songs by original artists 3 of those tracks (#9, #11, #14) are just clips from the show, it's just a bunch of space filler. Don't by this cd, my advice get a copy of the CD from someone who was dumb enough to go out and spend money on it."
4,Pop Stars 2 Introducing Scene 23 Results,"This CD is really good. I liked the T.V. show, and I thought I would buy the CD, and it turned out it was well worth my money. Mostly all of the songs are good. The only one I'm not to crazy about is All This Love. The Popstar Experience songs are good too. I really like I Believe I Can Fly and I Wanna Know. I'm not to fond of I Still Believe though. I think that the Inturludes give the CD a nice touch, and I enjoy listening to them. My favorite songs on the album are I Really Don't Think So and He Said She Said. Overall I think you should buy this CD!"
4,"OK, Not the best","I did like the songs, but not all of them were from Scene 23. Only 7 of 14 were their songs. The rest were interludes or songs from their audition (which were not sung by them). My favorite song is ""HE SAID SHE SAID"". Again, it's ok, but it might not be worth your money."
3,Wanted: More Scene 23,"I have watched a little of the show, but I saw the episode where they made their video and I really like the song, I Really Don't Think So, so I bought the CD.We could do without I Wanna Be a Popstar, Nervewracking, and Boot Camp. Judged is fun. The three songs not by the Popstars aren't all that good. The best one is by Mariah Carey. As for the Popstars, all their songs are really good except for maybe All This Love. My favorite is I Really Don't Think So. What She Got, The Greatest, and He Said She Said are good as well. I don't know why they only got seven songs when last year's popstars, Eden's Crush (a great album, check it out) got 13! Laurie has an amazing voice. Monika and Dorothy do too. I would like to hear more of Dorothy though. Maybe if they get a full album to themselves they can share the vocals more evenly. I'm glad I bought the CD because it has some good songs on it, but it could have been A LOT better. More Scene 23 and less Popstars 2 experience."
1,Could it BE any Worse?,"Ok, Pop Stars reality show? LAME. The only good music reality show was Making the Band... and even that got lame in its third season. If you buy this CD, I am sorry for you."
1,This CD is not That Good,"This CD is not that good. The ""Only"" good song is ""I Wanna Know"" By Joe. This CD is stupid and dumb. It's like they had to make the scene 23 CD. You cannot buy it. ""SO DON'T BUY IT LIKE"" I I SAID!"
4,A Good Beginning,"I recently purchased the Popstars 2 CD ""Introducing Scene 23"" because I saw a marathon of their show on the WB Superbowl Sunday. I did not see the show during the regular season but was upset that I didn't based on the marathon. It was great! I especially like Laurie and Donavan. They seem like real people. The CD was pretty good. I like ""I Really Don't Think So"", ""The Greatest"", ""He Said She Said"", ""What She Got"", & ""All This Love"". I really didn't like the track for ""Respect Me"" although the lyrics were pretty good. I only wished the CD had more of them and less of the interludes and music by other artists. Hopefully, Scene 23 will get a full length CD soon. I encourage people to buy it."
2,popstars yeah o.k !,when i first started watching the show they seemed like a pretty good group so when the c.d came i knew i had to have it.the over all it was a pretty good c.d but it disappointed me to find out that they only had like 7 orignal songs on there and the others were all by different artist.if you don't mind only a few songs by them then i say go out and buy it but if you don't than save your money on a artist that won't let you down on their first c.d
3,Disappointed,"When I heard about the CD comin out I was really excited to buy it then when I did buy it and I listened to it I was very unhappy. I thought that this album would be GREAT but instead it wasnt great it wasnt good at all. In ALL the songs you can only hear Donavon and Monika you cant hear anyone else's voice. Well now the cd is behind in my cd rack and I dont think I'm going to take it out for a very very long time. I feel that the cd isnt one of the greatest cd's I've heard so I dont think I'll be listening to it. Sorry if they are a group, then they should all sing like a group."
3,Rollercoaster- some good some bad,"I thought scene 23 cd had a few songs that i could nod my head to but, using 3 track from someone else on the 1st album wasn't a good move in my opinion. Also if scene 23 is a group, then why was josh and dorothy never heard? also i think that the clips on the cd instead of music was kinda stupid. If i wanted to hear clips from the show, i would've watched the show. I wanna hear music. but overall i would give them a 3/5."
2,[Imitations]!,"None of these songs are actually theirs- ""I really don't think so"" is a song fromn K-0tic, another UK pop stars group, ""the greatest"" is an S Club 7 group- why they haven't even given this band their own songs- they seem talented enough, but they're just basically like every other pop group. The end. If you're looking for some good ""pop"" music where a band sings their own songs, try eden's crush or s club 7 or something. I know this is a pretty [weak] review, but I just wanted to say that."
1,you have got to be kidding me,"This has to be a joke right? William Hung had more star quality than any of these so called ""popstars"". they just dont have what it takes to be in the music buisness and it shows because where are they now? nobody cares."
2,Disappointed,I took a class on stained glass many years ago and didn't find much new or exciting within the covers of this book.Based upon the cover photo and title I was expecting a book full of interesting new techniques or projects. I was disappointed to find that only the one on the cover met that expection for me.
4,One more book for the beginner,I am teaching myself stained glass--foil method and this was yet one more book to help me master this craft.
4,I would give it 5 stars but....,"I would give it 5 stars but the ending really surprised me...we liked it its a cute family movie. As a parent, it touched my heart."
4,Fun and easy,Great family movie. Funny and lighthearted. Had several interesting and humorous twist. Nice to have something different instead of a remake of an looks movie.
3,Family Fun.,Kids liked it. Safe for kids and nice message about family values. It will never be a classic but reasonable entertainment.
2,Was just okay,"About the only way I can describe the movie is ""sappy"". As I watched, I couldn't care what happened to anyone because they all came across as phoney."
5,Heartwarming story.,"Sure it's a bit far-fetched, but brought tears to my eyes. A great message about adoptive parenting and love. I've recommended it to several."
3,cute movie,Jennifer Garner made the movie worth watching but it was a little immature and predictable. Nevertheless it was enjoyable. Thanks
4,Sweet family movie,"My family, including 2 boys -12 & 9, enjoyed this film very much. It was sweet and very family friendly."
3,Cute,"This story captured a story of hope, love, and just conveyed and idea that good people should overcome bad people."
3,Good Movie,It sound interesting and I like jennifer Garner. Sometimes its nice to see a sweet movie like this one. I really like the whole movie nothing to dislike.
4,Excellent Family Movie,Precious story the entire family can enjoy. Unique storyline and characters. Timothy is a delight to watch and his sincerity is touching.
4,Nice movie,"Is a really good movie to spend a Friday night, not the best story but still good enough to keep your attention"
2,slow movie,I didn't like this movie at all. I kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. I do not recommend it.
5,Heartwarming Story,Parents could relate to this story that have had issues surrounding wanting to have children. The story was a surprise at the end.
4,It was pretty good,"The movie was cute and odd, a bit slow at times. Overall I thought the movie was pretty good. If I could rate it a 3.5 I would."
3,Entertaining,Not that there was anything wrong with this movie... it was entertaining. But I'm sure glad I didnt pay to see it in the theater!
4,total chick flick,"Husband thought it was too much for him. Hence I term it a chick flick. Kids loved it and it is suitable for children. I thought it was okay. It had moments that made you feel love, happiness, sadness. Quirky little number."
4,Excellent learning experience,This is a wonderful movie about parenting with love and allowing our children to become the best people they can possibly be.
4,Trying,I can relate to couples trying to have a baby. This movie hit home and left us happy with the outcome.
5,Excellent,What a wonderfully light hearted movie. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. Would recommend for all.. . . .
2,Too feel good and not enough substance,The whole purpose of Timothy was to help this couple realize that they would make good foster parents but the different aspects of the story appears to be disjointed. It didn't flow for me.
1,I laughed it was so bad,"Title says everythingInteresting idea, awful execution. Trailer makes it seem appealing, but after about 30 minutes you'll regret ordering like I did."
1,Saddest movie ever!,Don't let you're children see this movie. it is very depressing movie. My kids cried hard and thought it was the worst movie ever.
1,Weak,"Weak story line, questionable message, marginal acting. Doesn't get much worse. A dissapointment given so many favorable reviews. Possibly the worst Disney movie ever produced."
2,Okay film,The acting is good and the cinematography is well done but over all this is just a very okay movie. It is Mary Poppins in reverse and the story is a bit stale. Even my seven year old predicted just about every turn of events. We paid $3.99 to rent it so I am not too disappointed. Glad I did not go to the theater and spend more.
3,Cheese fest!,"Good movie, but really quite cheesy. But if you are looking for a nice light hearted movie with a few laughs here and there, this is it."
1,Was not able to view,"This movie might be very good, but I would not know as I was unable to get it to play."
1,Wrong Format,I did not want this movie on my kindle fire I wanted it to view on my TV but it was placed on my kindle fire..
2,Silly Knock-off of A. I.,"I watched this fantasy film with a house guest who raved about it and said I ""Just had to see it!"" But I squirmed uncomfortably throughout, trying to suspend my disbelief as this infertile couple who become the instant parents of this ""garden child"" struggle to explain their unlikely story to a couple of stern unsympathetic adoption agency bureaucrats. I waited in vain for something profound to take away from it as it wound down to its predictable conclusion."
1,NO CAPTION!,"Did not enjoy the movie with my daughter. Could not find setting for closed caption. Went through whole movie without understanding one word. I was very disappointed. I was looking forward to a pleasant evening watching a movie with my daughter at home. The movie looks so good that I was disappointed to not understand what was said between the characters. Thank you Amazon. Need to simplify this setting, if available. I will never pick another movie from here."
5,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"A clean, family movie with an imaginative plot and moving message. No violence, sex, or distasteful behavior. I recommend it."
4,Odd Life Of Timothy Green,Cute movie that the whole family can enjoy. My daughter and I really liked it. This is one I will probably buy for my movie collection
4,Insightful elements of human beings in their positive and negative behaviors. The story touches the heart and emotions.,"Insightful, touching, and numerous aspects of human behavior shown with positive and negative effects on others. Entertaining without being overdramatic and violent."
2,Parents were annoying,And it was too predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen. It was like a made for TV movie.
5,Great movie,This was an enjoyable movie for our kids (ages 9 and 7) and parents alike. Touching and cute and not too long either!
3,Feel good movie,While it was predictable it was a decent feel good movie. It would be a good movie to enjoy with your wife or girlfriend.
4,gift,"My sister loved the movie, I have not seen the movie myself. It arrived in good shape and arrived quickly"
5,Best one I've seen so far,"great movie, you will be on the edge of your seat all through it, Jennier Garner is so good in this movie, & they all actually make the movie with the good performances. Re-watchable no doubt."
5,Family Movie Night,My wife enjoyed this wholesome Movie. It was warm and quite comical at times. I would recommend it for Family Movie Night.
5,Adoption is a beautiful thing,"How wonderful to see Hollywood portray adoption as a good thing. We watched with our two kids who are both our ""real"" kids even though one came from her mom's stomach and one didn't. (You'll get this when you see the movie.) The pacing may have been slow for our teenager, but our younger enjoyed it and my wife and I were crying. Good, clean movie with a positive message on family. Absolutely a 5 star!"
3,Interesting,Hmm this one is kind of hard to go into details. It drama and a twist of magic. Wouldnt want to go to too much detail. May ruin the movie for ya.
3,Green Mile meets Hallmark channel,Loved the premise and the first part of the movie. The way it played out was tad disappointing; plot choices seemed either tired and predictable or entirely baseless and random. A missed opportunity but worth one viewing. Great visuals/cinemetography.
3,Timothy Green,"I thought the film would have been more interesting than it was. It's not bad if you have a problem having your own children and live in a fantasy world of ""let's bury our hopes and dreams in a box in the yard and I know we will have our own child."" Like Pinocchio becoming a real boy. It doesn't work that way in the real world and wasn't believable enough for me. Wanda"
4,Very sweet movie,"The movie was very very good but at times a little too cheesy. Still, its a great family movie and worth the rental."
3,Timothy,Uplifting story with predictable transitions till the final scene which is a reach. Fun to watch with the hanky at your side
4,Blurry Background,I enjoyed the movie but the video background was very fuzzy on many occasions. I think it was the playback and not in the movie itself.
3,"Movie Great, Amazon charged twice for the same title",Movie was great but the difficulties with the Amazon movie delivery system resulted in both my account and my wife's Amazon accounts being charged for the same rental. Mine would not start so we tried with her account and the movie worked. Now I am stuck with a rental movie. Amazon has to make rental easier.
4,Silly idea but it works,"The thought of ""growing"" a child was a strange one but it works! The movie was fun and entertaining. I loved Jennifer Garner in this film. The little boy who plays Timmy was great. Lots of talent in this film."
2,Trite and predictable,No the worst movie ever but no very good either. You know in the first few minutes what you are going to get. It tries to be more meaningful than it actually is.
1,Can't wait to give it away,"This movie was an eye rolling, annoying experience. As an adoptive parent, I was especially insulted by the idea that for this couple to arrive at the idea of creating a family through adoption, they had to have this bizarre, supernatural experience of literally having a ""home grown"" kid first. It had such an unbelievable plot and pathetic dialogue, and weak characters. It was so bad that I had to watch until the end to see if it could somehow redeem itself. This was the biggest waste of Disney dollars I've ever encountered, and I'm not sure how such a weak story made it to the point of wasting millions of dollars to make a weak movie. The only redeeming quality I could find was it was visually beautiful, but even that does not make it worth your time."
2,Thank god some plants only live a summer,Boring. Predictable. Boring. Perhaps if TG leaves had hallucinogenic properties more interesting plot lines good have been developed. Maybe I am too critical of mediocrity.
3,corny,"Corny. The kids enjoyed it. As for me, not so much. I guess I could say its a movie you watch before you watch the ""real movie"". You know, an appetizer. Haha."
2,Not what I expected,"This was not what I expected literally. The two scenes in the trailer that made me want to see this film were not in the film at all. Other than that ridiculousness, the movie was just okay. The actor playing Timothy was very good.....but, how did they manage to make Jennifer Garner annoying? She had more maturity playing a 13 year old in 13 going on Thirty. Save your money and wait for a free version."
1,The Stupid Life of Timothy Green,"The parents are selfish idiots mainly because they never from their mistakes and rarely ask their kid questions. The rest of the cast are mean-spirited this side of South Park. The screenplay is clumsy and unrealistic. In-fact,the way they make a kid is sick,twisted and of course,unrealistic. Frankenstein,Creepy Crawlers,Weird Science and even Milton the Monster had more realistic and sane ways of making people. The only good things about this film are the acting is pretty good and it knows what it wants to say(unlike Drop Dead Fred) but doesn't know how to say it correctly. Like Pagemaster,it's a noble cause but a failed delivery. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
1,Boring,"Boring, however this would be a good family film to watch together. No violence which is refreshing since even G rated films seem to have some sort of fighting going on."
3,""" Friendly Family Feel Good Movie But.....""","I love this type of movie and like a child I was so excited about viewing it. Well, I am not sure what I was expecting but in all honesty it just didn't pack the punch I thought it would. The Timothy character was definitely adorable.....mom and dad characters were okay. I felt something was definitely missing/lacking/even a wee bit lame with this movie. Sorry :("
2,Okay,"The acting was good, but the story was simplistic and predictable. The only events that happened were ones that demonstrated how the boy was exactly what the couple had wished for, thereby making the movie contrived and shallow."
2,Unmagical Weak Story,"This film was really boring. A kid sprouts from a couple's garden and has leaves on his legs. There is no magic or symbolism to these leaves or moral to the story. The movie pretty much goes on and on with the kid in soccer games, drawing portraits or playing musical instruments at a recital. There is really no climax or thrilling aspects to this film and thus it becomes a bore really fast. I think I might have been expecting too much from this film since Jennifer Garner is in it and it was under the Disney name. I should have passed on it nonetheless."
2,Wierd and boring,"This movie was strange and it just seemed to drag on. Not realistic at all, I wasn't even sad through it."
3,Just ok,Just ok. I expected more I guess. Honestly I was a little disappointed. The trailer covered all the highlights of the movie.
5,Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was funny and full of love and humanity. I also liked the ""honesty"" in the subject of wanting, but not being able to bear children."
4,great,"heart touching movie, love the ending. This movie fits for every mother in need and want. All the actors did a great job!"
3,the odd lfe of Timothy Green,"The odd life of Timothy GreenIt was a bit slow paced, Good family moviekind of predicable, acting could of been betterthanks for listening"
3,It's Okay,"I am glad I watched it, but it isn't an award winning show. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but some."
3,Good solid family movie,Feel good movie. Definitely good for the family as a rainy-day rental. I would definitely recommend this movie for kids.
3,Odd Life,I enjoyed the movie & so did my family. I was glad I didn't see it in the movie theater. I don't think it was good enough to spend all the money at a theater.
3,Sweet movie,Thought this movie was entertaining but kind of slow moving. Watched with my daughter and son-in-law and they agreed. Wish I had rented it vs buying it.
4,Cute movie!,"This is a good and clean ""feel good"" movie. The actors are quirky and the story fits into the small, factory town setting."
5,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"I absolutely love this movie, it's adorable and heart felt. Even as an adult I can't help but to cry everytime I watch it."
1,boring,boring boring borin. sorry but it was so yucky...if you are going to do fantasy then make it COOL...not everyday life.
4,Happy ending tear jerker,"It is a tear-jerker. Especially for those that might have or are close to someone with fertility issues. However, the ending is happy."
5,Great Movie,"This is a very heart warming movie. Very good for a family night as everyone will enjoy it, Don't forget to have the Popcorn ready!"
4,Review of movie. Liked it very much.,Very good movie. We liked it. We will recommend it to others.Will recommend to others. Thank you.Linda Bellamy
5,Loved it!,"This was a wonderful movie, loved every minute. Very inspirational, and well thought out. It was a comedy, tragety and love story all in one great story."
3,Just ok,"This movie was just ok. Kind of hooky. I liked it enough to rent but, I don't think I would buy it."
4,good tear jerker,"This movie was wholesome entertainment. Timonthy is adorable and the parents are good at being a lot like the rest of us. My son had a lot of quiestions after this movie, but even he loved it."
4,Very Sweet,I thought this movie was very touching. My daughter and I loved it. Would rhighly recommend this to families of all ages.
3,Disappointing movie and so-so streaming quality,"My wife was really looking forward to this movie. I wasn't, but I was expecting her to like it.In the end, both of us thought it was pretty bad.I wrote this tweet near the end:""If an airline offered me a free trip to Hawaii, and the in-flight movie was ""Timothy Green"", I would pass."""
3,Average movie,"Average acting, simple story line.The entire movie figured out in the first 10 minutes. How these movies with this brain dead story line get made is beyond me."
5,Nice movie,"Heartwarming and interesting... My husband and I loved it. It's nice to find a good feeling movie, and my kids watched it after and liked it too."
3,not as entertaining as I expected,"I was looking forward to this movie since it's been in the movie theaters. However, I was glad I didn't spend the money to watch it in the movie theater. It had a few likeable parts but it was just okay."
5,Loved Odd Life of Timothy Green,my family and I really loved this movie because it was a very caring and touching movie that kept you tuned in to the movie the whole time. Nothing was ever boring during this movie and it enlightened your heart.
3,just okay,"a strange story that dragged especially in the beginning , could have been done in 30 minutes , Timothy was adorable."
2,Waste of time,"It had a good overall theme - being kind, yadda yadda, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I've seen much much better movies...I didn't ""hate"" it, so I gave it two stars, but I wouldn't even watch it on cable again."
5,Magical,This story is so sweet your blood sugar will go up just by watching it. A new Christmas favorite! Great movie for kids and adults alike.
5,Odd Life is amazing!,"This movie was amazing. Yes Jennifer Garner was wonderful as usual. But the lead role and most of the kudos go to CJ Adams who played Timothy (Green). He really made the movie come alive. He was so smart, and angelic, and really made you fall in love with the character and believe in him. I think he's got a big future in 'the biz'.The story was very intriguing. It makes for entertainment from start to finish. I have to say, this is not very ""Hallmarky"" at all. Some might expect that. But it's not. Also if you don't see it coming, the ending will require a small supply of tissues.Also the music was very fun, and pretty.10 out of 10 for acting, directing, and story.I recommend this one whole-heartedly!"
5,the odd life of timothy green,"it was funny, sad and intriguing. i am going to have to buy this film for many more times of viewing"
5,Awesome movie!,"Very fair price, speedy delivery and in perfect condition. This is a WONDERFUL movie to watch with your family. You may need a box of tissues!"
3,'The Odd Life of Timothy Green' - it sure was.,"Watched it with a lady of my acquaintance and her mother on New Years' Eve. It was not my choice. That said, the movie was tolerable if - since it's a Disney product- one can suspend the unbelief sufficiently to permit the possibility of a child being produced by planting a box in a garden. That alone might give sex education teachers nightmares.Prejudices aside, the story was entertaining, if for no other reason than it provided opportunity for me to work out my ""Mystery Science 3000"" gene. I admit loving to ruin movies like this with side comments, which, I might add, is not always the best way to ingratiate oneself with those who might be watching it with you.Recommend it? Yeah, sort of, if you like contrived, overworked emotional plots. If you enjoy 'chick flicks', if kids who grow leaves on their legs are your sort of thing, then this movie's for you. Otherwise, watch it with some friends who have an irreverent sense of humor."
3,Too unbelievable,Not much of a story. Needed more depth. Not enough questions were answered in the dialogue. A Cute kid though.
4,Great movie!,"I would only caution for parents with young children, that there are parts which may upset them. With proper guidance it's a very enjoyable experience."
5,MOVIE,great movie very heartwarming. I recommend this movie to everyone. something different and unusual and for the whole family you will love it.
4,Very nice to see it with...,Very nice to see it with the family. My wife and kids liked it. Very nice for a Sunday afternoon
4,Good,"Really good movie. I did not like the ending to much, but all in all a good film and i would reccomend it to friends!"
4,Quirky but sad,"The movie is very well done and the plot interesting, but as a parent, I found the ending quite sad."
4,Magical!,"Loved this movie, it was beautiful and kind. I don't see many movies these days because there is so much violence, nudity, and language. I rented it and watched it two times and now I will be adding it to my collection."
3,Kinda wierd,"Interesting and intriguing story, but wierd. The main characters seemed way over the top, but I have met people like that; just don't seem believable."
5,Simply Beautiful!,"I remember seeing the previews for this film earlier this year and thought ""ehhh, maybe I'll watch it one day when I'm bored.."" So last night I viewed it and it made me cry it was so amazing. It is predictable and heart-warming..but it made me, a 26 old guy cry! The story to me reaches deeper than what is seen on the outside. It is filmed extremely well and the acting is perfect in my opinion. So to all who love action and killing, cut it out for a moment and watch this film and open your heart to being a warm hearted human!"
4,A very good wholesome movie,I like Jennifer Garner and she was a big draw for me to check out this movie. The trailers when it first came out also seemed interesting to me. It was well worth watching with a message of hope and redemption. It has a bitter sweet ending and is a bit of a tear jerker. I am pleased that I took the time to watch this movie.
2,disappointing,"I was so hoping this would be whimsical and sweet, like my favorite movie, Big Fish. Instead it is choppy, and leads to many "" whaaat?"" moments. You could drive a semi through the plot, and I usually am ok with the willing suspension of disbelief. The weird girlfriend who tries to kiss ( ewww this kid is like, 8 ) Timothy is just creepy. No info is offered about her, as a matter of fact few characters are at all likeable. Jen Garner tries very hard, and she is the only glimmer of ok here. so sad, this movie could have rocked. Save yourself some cash, don't bother."
2,just okay,Yes the movie has a solid message and really gets you at the end but it just seemed to be missing something to make you care about the characters more. I don't know if it was the format of them telling the story or just the arbitrary feeling to the people he helped or the common stereotypes used. But it lacked something to truly pull you into the story and characters.
2,didn't like,we didn't like this movie. thought it was going to be something different about the boy and it turned out to be about a couple who we desperate for a child of their own.
2,movie was good,The movie was good but the streaming was horrible. I have a cable connection and the movie repeatatly kept stopping.
3,"Sappy movie, definitely a chick flick","This is not a guy movie, a total chick flick, but worth renting and watching.Its a nice kid movie too."
4,Ordered for gift,Ordered before release; received in time for Christmas gift; when shipped price reduced from original ordering price which was a pleasant surprise.
1,No Sound ...... Bad Feed from your company,There was NO Sound.....something wrong with your feed. I watched other movies that night but could not get sound with yours. Please refund my money and hopefully I will get sound the next time I want to see a movie. I want to see this movie......should I try again?
1,"Movie was great, video streaming was terrible","The movie was great when we were not re-loading. It froze 7 times which was very annoying, forcing us to reload/restart. We use a Logitech Revue with Linksys E4200 router, both of which we rebooted but the problem persisted leading me to believe it was on Amazon's end. We have before & since streamed video from other sources with NO problems."
1,Horrid.,"Worst. Movie. Ever. Only has a star because I had to. I can't believe any other review was given. Cliche, boring and utterly ridiculous."
5,I loved this story. What a sweet little boy!,I loved the way this little boy was so positive and sweet from the heart. It was an awesome story.
3,Cute movie,"A cute little movie for young viewers, not toddlers, maybe 8 and up. Cute story that could be a children story book too."
5,Great family movie,"This was a very good family movie with no cussing, nudity or crudeness. It is very rare to find a movie like this these days that the whole family of all ages can enjoy. We loved it!"
4,excellant,It was so good I added it to my bluray dvd collection. i thought it would be cheesy but wasn't. Well written.
3,"Not bad, just don't let the details get to you.",My wife and I enjoyed this movie just because it was such a break from the norm. It was a sentimental look at a childless married couple hungry for kids. The movie has a sweet end.
2,Real Different,To me this was a strange movie that was hard to figure out. It was just too hard to imagine.
4,Cute family movie,This is a fun family movie that shows how little time we have to be family. It is nice to see Jennifer back making movies again.
2,"Good concept, poor execution","The story line is interesting enough, but it was just flat. Most characters were one-dimensional, either ""good"" or ""evil."" I was bored."
4,Cute movie,"This movie was cute, predictable, but cute and made a good Xmas present for my girlfriend. We made a garden baby too :)"
2,O.K. Movie for lighter fare.,"O.K. movie if you want something mellow to watch with spouse or girlfriend. Not much of a ""guy's movie"". Decent to watch when you want to watch a ""heartwarming"" type drama."
3,Okay,Movie wasn't bad. I was hoping for more but it was kind of slow and drawn out. Not bad but not great.
4,Mixed,My 17 year old daughter liked it but my 66 year old mother would have given it only 2 stars. She thought it was boring
4,So much silly fun,"Made you think. Helped me pass some time smiling and thinking. It is a kind movie that is remarkably simple, but relays a complex story. Enjoyed it, maybe no Oscar buzz, but nice to watch alone or with Family. There are not too many of those around."
3,Fun movie,"Fun, family movie -- good watch for middle of a Saturday afternoon with your wife or kids, or maybe your dog."
3,Predictable but fun,"Fun movie, just do not have huge expectations and you will enjoy it. I liked the story, and it was well-written. A tear jerker too."
3,Nice Story,We enjoyed this family movie. Everyone thought it was very emotional. The acting was not very good except for Timothy.
5,Wonderful family movie,This movie is heartwarming & extremely touching! Even my children thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone.
4,"Good for whole family, but is pretty much what you expect it to be if you have seen similar",Family really liked this. Any movie that can hold the attention of our boys (6 and 8) automatically gets a three. Wife liked this one as well. Interesting twist on a well worn story line.
3,just ok,"Ok to watch but no great movie.Acting weak.Story line trying to be fine good but falls short.There are much better ""family"" movies at there."
3,review,cute family movie. not one of Disney's best movies. more like a made for tv show glad I dud not see this at the theater.
3,It's okay,A good story line and may make one think on how they carry out life. Acting could have been better.
3,Timothy Green,A little on the odd side but enjoyable. Takes some imagination to accept the story but it was a good movie. I like Jennifer Garner.
3,Well,I was exited to see this moive. But... I felt it left some parts a litlle open. The script could have been better in spots.
2,Kinda borring,Short story not really much substance to the whole movie. It's a chick flick. I would wait till it comes out on redbox for a dollar.
4,Great movie,"I bought this movie without seeing it, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was really good and sweet, a tear jerker though. I'm really glad I bought it. You'll fall in love with Timothy too."
4,The Odd life of timothy Green,"So good, but so sad! Beautiful scenery. I would not reccomend this movie to my friends and family, we are too tender hearted."
3,heart warming,"a little cheesy but I expected it to be, cutesy story but we enjoyed watching it. would recommend if you're looking for a family movie."
4,Kute movie,Kutest movie ever. This is a good family film and there were some good laughs. I would watch it again.
4,The odd life wasn't that odd...,"It was a sweet movie. But the fact that all the people that met Timothy didn't even question or blink that he just ""appeared"" one day was a little surprising I guess. In a perfect world..."
4,good family movie,"While I think quite a bit more could have been done with this movie given it's sci-fi/fantasy story line, it was still good all around family fare. The cast did a believable job and kept the script entertaining. As empty nesters, we still appreciate quality family films and usually watch those that throw other genres in the mix such as the addition of fantasy in this one. We will most definitely watch this again when the grandkids visit."
5,movie on kindle hd,this is a wonderfully heartwarming movie appropriate for adults and children. so sweet and moving in and perfect for holiday viewing when the feeling of love abounds
2,I didn't get it,"I did not get this movie at all. I failed to find a message, if it was supposed to have one. Just a time pass..."
5,Sweet story,"I rented this movie to watch with my mom. It was a perfect ""chick"" flick! Very sweet story and good acting."
4,Very sweet,Very good family movie. We are always looking for a good family to watch. My kids are 9 and 10 it is hard to find a movie the whole will enjoy. The whole family enjoyed this movie.
2,incredibly weak script,incredibly weak script. overacting. incredible amount of missed opportunities to connect with a bigger message. often felt like actors are trying trying to do the job of the scriptwriter and the director.
5,Excellent Family Move,"I normally love action flicks, but this one is a great movie it's something the whole family can watch and enjoy."
4,weird,Ok so the movie is very nice but does the authorities question when Timothy came from or where he dissapeared too?
3,Odd but Good,"I loved the concept of the garden boy and the parents just learning as they go, but i would have liked it more if there had been a point to the house they were building in the woods. It was pretty sad, but overall pretty good!"
4,Better Than I Expected,This is a strange and touching tale about two childless people who find happiness through a gift of love from a most unexpected source. The story line is totally unpredictable and thoroughly entertaining. If you are prepared to accept some really unusual story elements in this fantasy you'll be handsomely rewarded.
4,cute movie about a couple who find their perfect child covered in leaves and dirt.,"A coming of age story for adults that aren’t quite ready for parenthood through adoption, but realize they are ready after they find a boy that appears to be from their garden."
3,"ummmm, ok.",(from wife) - She wondered if they were on a low budget - didn't hold her attention well! But not a total waste of time.
3,It's ok - not great,I enjoyed the movie but was glad I rented it rather than pay to watch it at the cinema. It wasn't worth that $50 for sure.
3,Okay but not great,The hype was better than the movie... I really expected better and was very disappointed. I DID NOT LIKE IT!!!
3,Decent Movie for the Family,"Watched this movie with the kids, sort of predictable in both plot and ending but still enjoyable. I would recommend this movie for family movie night."
4,Movie,Good movie for the whole family to watch. I am glad to have made this purchase. I would recommend this movie.
3,Slow but interesting,"Definitely a ""feel good"" movie but interesting. My wife and I liked the movie but it was slow at times."
4,NICE FEEL GOOD MOVIE W/ THE WIFE,"I watched this movie with my pregnant wife last Sunday over dinner. Even though this is a kids movie the content and story line is good enough to keep any adult entertained.The movie is very good, but not great in my opinion. I feel that there were a few scenes that were overly cheesy. The film emphasizes acceptance, perseverance, and maintaining a positive attitude though the experiences of Timothy Green and his parents.You feel good and appreciate your life more after seeing this film.Overall this is a solid movie that I would not mid watching again or recommending to someone else."
4,Great show,I enjoyed the show a lot. It seemed like the whole family would enjoy it. I could not get it to work though with the Ipad app.
3,Chewing gum for the mind.,"I bought this thinking it would be funny. Although there were some funny spots, it was just something to watch."
3,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"I thought ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"" was a good movie and sweet but not great. I enjoyed it but thought it was sad."
4,Entertaining movie,"This is a movie I'd been wanting to see but it was gone in theaters before I could get there. Luckily, Amazon had it. The movie was a feel-good imaginary tale with a message. I enjoyed it."
4,Great family movie,Great movie for the whole family! My 10yr. old son watched this movie with me and we really liked it.
4,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,Unique and imaginative. Puts one in touch with their feelings and gives hope perhaps to couples struggling with trying to have a family.
4,Cute family film,"Lite, cute family film. Fantasy with an adorable premise. Those struggling with getting pregnant will certainly enjoy the story line."
4,I loved it!!!,It was nice and funny but weird.i watched it two times.i thought the weird part was that he had leafs.
3,Meh,"It was an average movie. Nice concept, but only average execution. The story had some holes in it, and the characters were fairly predictable."
4,good movie,"but of course, didn't it win awards? It should have. wonderful story line, good acting, I will probably watch it again sometime."
4,Nice family movie!,I must say it was a very charming movie for the family. We had no idea on what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.
4,Timothy Green movie,"This movie felt like a feel good movie, until the last 10 minutes. Then they picked it up and saved the day. The ending happened too quickly. Good actors and overall a okay movie."
2,Just a flop,"The idea of the story is nice, but from the way the boy was introduced, all the way through the movie, I was not really engaged. I thought it was dumb."
3,It's ok,Was kind of a strange movie but was cute too. Not my favorite. I wondered about the movie so now I know.
2,Not impressed,"My wife and I rented this movie thinking it would be an emotional movie. There was so little characterization of Timothy that the viewer doesn't really get attached to him. He seems to be something of a robot. As a result when big emotional moments come it's hard to really feel strongly. In short, no tears are jerked in this particular tear jerker."
2,Boring movie,I did not like this movie. I though it would be good because of the actors in it but I was disappointed. I wish I had my four dollars back.
4,movie,very heart warming sweet movie ...gives a person hope...very up lifting chick flick would watch again again sweet and heart warming movie
3,"""Different strokes for different folks""",I am not a big movie buff but decided to rent this movie to see if it interested me but sadly it did not.Hopefully the next one I rent will!Thank you for the rental.
4,cute,I thought this was a very cute family movie. Its a story about unconditional love and hope. A must see!
3,Cute Movie!,"Cute Movie! This movie was cute but just too unbelievable! There are no parents that are so ""ignorant"" to believe their child grew in a garden. Must have been a low budget film! Happy I didn't I didn't watch before buying DVD."
3,Very Hallmark.,"It looks like they wanted forest gump, but scale of movie did not fit the vision, budget, or acting. So ok but not great."
2,Went downhill in a Hurry,"When I viewed advertisements of this movie I expected to be entertained. However, the plot bounced all over the place and for me was not entertaining. In short, I think that the writers wasted a good chance. A disfunctional set of parents is not what enhances a ""feel good"" movie."
3,Cute feel good movie,"I was interested in seeing this movie after watching all the previews. It did not meet my expectations. I didn't hate it, it was okay."
5,Great movie,This was a Christmas present for my niece. Personally I have never watched the movie but she has and she loves it.
4,The Odd Life of Timoty Green,This is a nice family movie! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie although it was mostly predictable but very good acting.
1,boring,"never finished it, it was so boring to begin with I turned it off. It was a total waste of money for me."
3,Cute,"Say this with my granddaughter,(11) She liked it. I thought it was ok not really my kind of movie. It was entertaining. Just not very believable, for me."
2,Green,"This is a kid's story and would probably be good for them. I found it a little tiring as an adult. This story is OK and the acting is pretty OK. There is also a good outcome. For me though I could take it or leave it, mostly leave it."
2,Blahhh,It would be better if they could only explain how a guy who works in an old rundown pencil factory and whose wife is a maid can afford a 1) fertility doctor 2) a big beautiful house w/ manicured lawn 3) a new Subaru. I'm more inclined to believe that a child could be born of a tree then living their lifestyle on such income.
3,Don't bother unless your kids really want to watch it.,We only watched this movie because my kids wanted to see it and I was sick of watching animated movies. Was glad when it was over.
5,Great Movie for the Whole Family,"Amazing movie. My husband and I stayed attentive through the whole thing, as did my girls, 3 and 5. It's not very often that there is a movie that keeps all 4 of us interested!"
4,Odd Life of Timothy Green review,"I liked the movie. It clearly is not believable, but it was fun for me to see Timothy's affect on others as well as their affect on him."
4,"Not what I expected, but well worth it!","All I can say either watching by yourself or with family, be prepared to cry, laugh, and cry again. Thank you Disney for a Great Movie."
2,Too sad!,"Good movie but ended way too sad!!! I was sobbing like a baby! I guess if u don't have kids of ur own it might not be as bad, but I was not comfortable watching it with my kids."
3,It was just ok,A little slow and very predictable I would not recommend it to my friends. But not sorry I watched it
4,Good Movie,"A good movie for an evening with the entire family. Well worth watching. No big plot to it, just good entertainment with a good message to it."
3,QUIRKY!,A very cute and QUIRKY movie........good for family watching. the premis is so far out there but full of good intentions.
4,Timothy Green Review,While watching the Odd Life Of Timothy Green the picture would get blurry through out the movie. I tried to notice if there was a pattern or cause for the blurriness but I found none. It was still a delightfull story.
3,Prespective,The era globalizatation after finished east and west block grows the models of terrorisme. We can assumcced the prespective and the new model of terrorrisme in the world.
5,Classic Dale Warland,"As has been the case with most DWS recordings, this is truly a classic. Beautifully sung, with new and interesting arrangements of traditional favorites, this disc is a must for all holiday music and DWS fans. Of note are Stephen Paulus' rhythmic ""The Holly and the Ivy"" and Praetorius' beautiful ""Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming"" arranged by Jan Sandström. I highly recommend this recording."
5,The band teacher wasn't wrong!,My son's band teacher recommended this product and he was right...this stuff is the best! It isn't greasy and runny like most lubricants..easy to apply without a huge mess.
3,Students Love It,"I've assigned my students a book review of Seeing & Writing as part of an ""argument essay"" at Western New England College. Early drafts seem to indicate that almost all of the students ""enjoyed"" the book (a strange verb for a textbook.) They were not unaware of its flaws, however, especially the absence of hardly any authors born before 1950, and the triviality of many of the essays. Some found the illustrations ""too numerous"" and of ""doubtful relevance"" to the essays and stories.The final essays aren't in yet. Stay tuned."
2,Be Warned--A Terrible Composition Textbook,"No one has commented on this book but I feel obligated to warn college instructors and professors who might consider the use of this textbook. Quite simply, don't. This is the fourth introduction to composition text I've used and by far the worst. Although sleek looking and extremely usable, the readings are terrible; shallow, short, and redundant. The book aims to incorporate multiple literacies into the composition classroom, an idea I like and still think potentially fruitful. But ""Seeing and Writing"" never goes beyond putting a photo next to and essay and saying ""compare."" If the essays had any rhetorical or intellectual richness this might not be such a bad idea. But my students rarely find much to say about these essays, usually astute enough to note the obviousness of most of the writing.Some of my colleagues have claimed the book panders to contemporary students, which I find unfair. However, it most certainly underestimates them."
5,Fate is one of 5 CD's purchased Suhalia Salimpour -,excellent music for classic tribal bellydancing+listening enjoyment. The vendor was above par as well! I couldn't be happier with my purchases.The vendor even sent a replacement immediately upon notification that one of the CD's purchased arrived in two pieces - didn't miss a beat (pun intended)! Thanks - highly recommend!
1,Merrell Barrado Leather shoe,"Compared to other Merrell products that I have used, these shoes just don't compare. Although, they are stylish looking, they offer zero support and are too uncomfortable to wear all day. I have a retail store and spend my day on my feet. My test of a comfort shoe is to wear them for a day in my busy store. These shoes just don't pass the test. I had to resort back to my worn Merrell clogs or my Keene Mary Janes."
1,Metro Shoe Warehouse,"This is the first time I have written a product review. I ordered a pair of Merrell Barrado shoes from Metro Shoe Warehouse. The shoes arrived with a broken zipper. Metro advised that the other pair in stock was the same as the pair I returned. Metro would not credit my account for the shipping costs - either way - for a defective pair of shoes. I offered to split the shipping costs and Metro would not agree to this compromise. Most companies do not even charge shipping costs, and certainly not for a defective product. Clearly Metro does not believe in either making the customer happy or that the customer is always right. I will NEVER order another product from Metro."
1,"Buggy, unusable -- stay away","I bought this product and returned it the next day. I agree with the other reviewers -- it's completely unusable, and it really shouldn't even be on the market. The clip art objects, when brought into a new file, were too gigantic to manipulate -- so huge I couldn't even find end points to resize the image. The zoom did not appear to work at all. The text box followed around my mouse's movements even though I clicked repeatedly to place the text in one place... How did this product get on the market?"
1,"Slow, unresponsive and unusable",Not a good program. Took me a couple of hours to design a logo that I can do in Printshop in about five minutes. Do not buy!!!!!
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","Really beyond Awful, and with NO customer support. I have been emailing them all day, to no avail.I just agree totally with the 3 reviews above and don't see the need to add.Makes me want to go back to PUBLISHER on my PC."
1,complete waste of money,i was not impressed at all. The video showed a different style than i received. The style actually shipped is uncomfortable. Although it looks like it would provide support for your back and neck to target the abs it actually puts you in a more uncomfortable position and hurts your neck and back without targeting the abs at all. I would use the pilates ball over the bean any day.
5,Innovative,The presentation of arithmetic theory and applications is innovative. Some of the topics are inedited; they present new approaches for both algorithmic and implementation aspects. It is a very interesting reference book for what refer to computer arithmetic in general and special purpose arithmetic circuit in particular.
5,great product,"very sturdy, works as described. water tight. seems just as good or better than some more expensive models i looked at. i use it to put Seachem's Denitrate in. and use the included ball valve to bring down the flow to less than 50gph so that it works to remove nitrates."
1,Poor design,"This reactor is poorly designed and requires far too much work to clean. If the bottom sponge become clogged, you must remove all of the media to get to the bottom sponge. Why wasn't this designed with the ability to remove both the top lid AND bottom lid? If the top sponge becomes clogged it pushes the media up through the exit flow and into the tube. This brand seems to have a loyal group of followers who can find no fault with any of these products and I bought it based on the reviews. Total waste of money and I have found an alternative design that works much better for me."
4,Entertaining and watchable,"Forget about the lack of ethics of Dreyfuss' character, the immaturity of all of the cops involved, and the predictability of the story ... the film is just a real pleasure to watch.Richard Dreyfuss is really funny. The scene where he starts doin' his stupid little dance to The Rhythm is gonna Getcha just had me crackin' up.Aidan Quinn is surprisingly effective as an escaped convict and do I need any words to describe how good Madeline Stowe looks... I didn't think so.You'll laugh a whole lot."
5,Better than most cop thriller,"Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout (along with partner Emilio Estevez) of pretty Madeleine Stowe (they have to watch her house through the night), and he falls in love with her. Before the movie is over there's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer (Aidan Quinn). It's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie, but the script is above average - especially the dialogue - and Dreyfuss's performance is right on target. A very entertaining movie; definitely worth a watch."
2,It was okay,Too much bad language in this movie. It was funny to watch but kept getting distracted by all the useless bad words consistently used throughout the movie.
4,"Fun, well acted action comedy","Enjoyable buddy cop movie with good performances by Richard Dreyfus,Emilio Esteves and a nice change of pace by Aidan Quinn as a heavy.While a familiar subject, the film is handled with panache, and the mixof character comedy and action comes off well most of the way, althoughit loses some balance by the end, with the acton taking a little toomuch of the center stage, and the humor getting a bit lost.Not amazing, or life-changing, but more fun and better madethan most 1980s mainstream Hollywood films."
4,Stakeout this movie,"When I first saw this movie, I wasn't sure how it would play out. However, I ended up really liking it - the humor, the romance and even the drama. Richard Dreyfuss does a great job creating a character who is funny while still being sympathetic. Emilio Estevez is a good counter-balance, helping keep the movie from being a total farce."
5,the result of a year-long project in critical thinking,"Cronan has done it again! This volume of essays critically examines the concept of wilderness, nature, and humanity's role in the modern world. Though the individual essays are somewhat uneven, the main theme of the book is clearly communicated, especially in Cronan's introductory piece. That is, that the concept of wilderness needs careful rethinking, particularly with our world nearing 10 billion persons."
3,Compilation,I returned this when I realized Prof. Cronon was the editor not the author. It's a collection of essays. I read a few. Not as good as Prof. Cronon can write.
3,Decent,"The only complaint I have about this hole punch is that the depth guide/guard tends to slip. It's easy enough to set the guard for the depth of the badges you wish to punch, however when you insert a badge into the punch, it pushes the guide back so you lose your pre-set depth. You have to basically hold the guard in place while you make the punch. Quite frustrating when you are attempting to punch numerous badges."
1,This card is not worth the money!,"To much money for old Technology, yes it is true same as Geforce2!Rodeon 9000 cost less money and smokes this card.More info can be found guru3d.comHere are benchmarks from 3d Mark 2001 on Athlon XP 1800+3D Mark 2001SE 800x600 1024x768 1280x1024 1600x1200GeForce2 MX 400 3758 2648 1620 1063GeForce4 MX 420 4758 3693 2443 1670Gigabyte Radeon7500 4950 4084 2876 2077Prophet 7500 AIW 4787 4267 3368 2542Trancend Radeon 7500 5355 4805 3800 29263D Blaster 4 MX 440 5414 4962 3973 3027eVGA GeForce4 MX 440 5499 5081 3969 3024GeForce3 Ti 200 6726 6123 5065 3992Prophet 8500DV 7530 6550 5343 4124Ati Radeon 9000 Pro 7615 6705 5515 44223D Blaster Ti 500 7504 6947 6132 5100Hercules Radeon 8500 128 8532 7718 6549 5319"
2,Similar to the geforce 2 MX,"this card is the brother of the geforce 2 mx with traditional sd ram which does not perform as good as ddr(double data rate). if you were considering to buy this card because its cheap, i would recommend the geforce 4TI4200 or Rodeon 8500LE 128MB (same price as G4MX). Its has ddr, directx 8.1 that the geforce 4 mx doesn't have. Currently the Roden 8500 is cheaper than this card since it is on sale."
1,There are better options for the price,"This is WAY too much for a GF4 MX440. For the price, go buy a 128MB GF4 TI4200. Yes, it is possible to find it. Or if you REALLY want an GF4 MX (why you would is beyond me), wait for the NForce2 motherboards to come out soon."
1,Statistic lies,I read a lot of websites and magazine reviews for this Geforce4 mx card. this Mx version is actually a souped up version of the Geforce 2 and increased it's memory and core clock speed to give you MX. the card is not faster then the Geforce 3 ti 500 but it is faster then the previouse Geforce 2's.Get Rodeon 7500 much better deal than this!Amazon has it all in here!
4,Well worth the purchase...,"I bought this card for my Athlon 800 last night. I had it installed and tearing up Grand Theft Auto 3 in ten minutes. I found it for $[money] and consider each penny, money well spent."
5,Super Refreshing!,This a super refreshing cologne to use after your bath. I can assure you it revigorates your body... and mind!
2,Clunky,"This game did not live up to my expectations. Moving the main character around was very difficult. I played for a while and had to quit. My 80 days was going fast because I couldn't manuever. It would have been a great game. Don't waste your money. By the way, I will try to finish the game but I have to build up my tolerance and patience."
3,A decent prototype for the new adventure game...,"...Now if they could only get the fun factor factored in, this type of exploration based gameplay might appeal to a more broad crowd..While offereing a huge variety of places to explore in pretty beautiful 3d rendered locations, 80 days gameplay quickly devolves into uninspired fetch quests, which is a shame because this game had a lot of potential with it's fresh format."
3,Harry Potter the real experience,"This game was fun but it took a lot of work to cast the spells. Unlike previous games where a person could just press the square, triangle, or circle buttons to cast a spell, they now have to move the left analog stick in the different directions, or a series of directions to cast different spells. This is hard at first and it was hard to remember what ways you need to turn your analog stick, but I have found as I played the game more, it became more enjoyable. Althought I like this game it seems like it was made for the Wii system, because of the way you have to cast your spells."
3,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"This game is OK it has a few flaws and it can be a little slow, Also when you are to do something it doesn't always do it. But it is OK."
2,"C# ok, but where is the .NET part?","The book is a fair introduction to the C# language but it helps little with the .NET platform and even less with using C# + .NET to get things done. There is just a hint of interesting questions in the last two chapters, but Web Services are presented in a rather vague nutshell and space is wasted digressing about VS toolbox widgets instead of code examples.It was somehow infuriating to read the comment that debugging ASP.NET with the new Visual Studio is ""easy"" compared with the old Visual Interdev. In fact it is just as IMPOSSIBLE and even Microsoft's own documentation doesn't help at all. I guess the Redmond dudes still cannot fix the bugs in their debugging process. Oh well... <sigh>"
2,MSDN is better so save your money,I find the information in the book not very useful. The book was probably rushed and does not contain enough detailed information to solve my programming issues. I have to go to MSDN to learn how to it. Save your money.
2,Not a good reference,"I saw the spate of good reviews this book got and purchased the same. Unfortunately, I seldom get whatever information I'm looking for in this book. This book covers very little ground and is probably suitable for a developer who has little development experience.I was hoping for a ""reference"" sort of book and a book which covers a lot of ground and I found: ""Professional C#"" to be most helpful."
2,Plenty of faults,"Yes, this I couldnt say same good things as others. I never seen code, typing or graph error on other book. Also this book isnt a reference or tutorial or case study. Something try to be all off them...And if you you know something about java you will feel like reading for dummy book.Maybe faults cames from publisher because wrox's book doesnt include many error like this one."
5,The best .NET book so far,"I bought this book the same month when it's published. At that time it was my 2nd .NET book. Since .NET is fresh stuff I thought I should buy other books for more information. Now , when I have at least 7-8 .NET books, I can say this one is really good book and I can't remember that I got any new information from all other books."
4,Great book for learning basics of C# and .NET,"This book is a great book to get you started with .NET and C#. There are some areas that don't go into a lot of detail but it is impossible to cover everything in one book.I think it does a great job explaining how the .NET platform works, this is essential no matter what .NET language you are using and I thought Andrew's explanation of Assemblies, app Domains etc.. was great.I also think his coverage of the C# language is good. He has examples of all the major project types, ie windows forms, ASP.NET, web services etc.. There are some errors in the code but that is to be expected since the book was written with Beta 2. There is a posting of errata on the Apress website.All in all a great book when learning .NET if you are using C#."
2,A bit deprecated. Needs to be rev'ed up.,"I tend to agree with other reviewers. This book is great. Or should I say ""was"" great. I bought it with a sticker that hides the beta 2 compatibility and says instead: ""Updates for final release available NOW online!"" Thanks, better than nothing, but not enough. I use this book as a desktop companion while programming with .NET and when I am looking for something, I need to:1) look at the book and the deprecated examples.2) go online and correct the example with the new API.This is not once in a while. All the Windows form examples need an update. System.timer won't work at all, etc... Pretty irritating. When the 2nd edition comes out, I'll be more than happy to get it and review it accordingly. In the mean time, you should be aware of this if you plan on buying this book."
4,4.5 Star Introduction for the Professional to C# and .Net,This book does not insult your intelligence and is at the same time an easy read. (Though the level of B. Stroustrup's book on C++ is not reached.) Roughly 200 hundred pages are C# specific. The majority of the rest is a description of the .Net class libraries. It is absolutely sufficient for a thorough and enjoyable understanding of C#. .Net itself is so rich that it would require at least a factor of four more pages. This book gives you a nice start on the new world of the .Net concepts though. This book has only one problem it is too heavy in physical weight. Please on the next edition make two volumes of it. In short this book serves well for any developer interested in the subject.
4,Good book to get you started,"This is a good book to begin with. However, there is too much information about GUI programming and GDI+ and very concise coverage of the topics like multithreading, networking, building custom controls, etc. I think these topics are more important than drawing lines and circles for any programmer. Anyway, it's good to start."
5,A conceptual content for beginners and experienced guys,"Good choice! You will find all the conceptual topics needed to really understand C#. May be you will miss some guides to manage and drive the GUI, but do you really need a book for it?It is not a book to learn how to ""Open a C# project"" or ""Save an application"", ""How to write a data through ADO"", etc.. It is a book to learn and UNDERSTAND C#. It's simple!"
5,The best that you have got,"The only complete book on the subject. This book stands far and tall above all other books that are published. It explains every detail of the frame work lucidly. Anybody who has read Andrew's COM and ATL needs no introduction of this guys capability in explaining the toughest things. GREAT BOOK to buy. Thank you Andrew for presenting us, the developers, with great books like this."
2,...,"I'll give Microsoft there dues, they try. The entire book is on CD Rom for easy searching and comes with a DVD of Visual Studio Evaluation Edition. It provides a good overview of the C# & VB .net languages but doesn't go deep enough and has too many mistakes. I don't know how anyone could expect to pass a certification exam using this book alone. If you want to learn C# get Andrew Trolesen's C# and the .NET Platform."
4,Very good reference for C# and .NET,"This was the only good book I found that explains C# in the Visual Studio .NET paradigm. The author jumps right into the core features of the language and does not waste time comparing C++ and C#. There is also a good deal of explanation about ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Web Services. Concentrating on the advanced features of ASP.NET would have made it complete, but I guess that needs a separate book on its own!"
4,"Excellent, but...","- No chapter on the .NET XML types. Too bad...- Weak chapter on ASP.NET...Other than this, go for it!"
4,Almost enough,"It should be noted that this book is written with the assumption that you are an experienced programmer unfamiliar with .NET. That having been noted - There's plenty of information in this book to get you ""up and running"". However, don't expect this book to be your definitive source for any specific topic. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is the inequity with the intro to ASP.NET. It seems that the information in that chapter could have done without an intro to Web servers and HTML formatting and more focus on some features completely left out such as security(Forms authentication), Web User Controls, etc. There is enough information in this book on any given topic to get started figuring out most things on your own but it rarely delves into any advanced features. I would recommend this book as a collection of ""tutorials"" on C# and .NET - for those roles, I feel the book does a wonderful job."
2,Nothing New!,This book has nothing to add to the original. It is a waste of money. The first I Hate To Cook Book was just delightful. I feel her daughter's is a cheap copy to make money.
3,I still hate to cook!,"I thumbed through it, thought it had a few good ideas, then it went on a shelf -- because I still hate to cook!"
4,Finally in Hardback!,"I wore out my paperback copy of this book and so looked forward to an updated version. Lovely forward by author's daughter. Just wish they had converted some of the recipes from 'small can of..' to 5 oz, can of."
3,I Hate To Cook,"Easy to read and good old common sense recipes. Since I'm a collector of cook books, I was a expecting a little more. Don't know how I missed this book years ago. Someone gave me 'their' recipe for chili and it was found in this book!!! It's my favorite."
3,A bit disappointing,"I loaned somebody my copy of the Compleat I Hate to Cook Book a few years ago (and have yet to get it back), so I bought this book to replace it. It's not a replacement, though. It's missing one of my favorite chapters, ""Cooking if Alone"", and I miss Hilary Knight's cover art from the older edition.Still, it's a Peg Bracken classic and I'm glad it's been reissued. Just maybe next time, include all the chapters from the old one?"
5,Wonderful cookbook for cooks and non-cooks alike,"This cook book was written before the days of the microwave oven, fast food, and many other modern grocery store convenience foods we find today when we go to the market. Cooks back then had to learn kitchen shortcuts that used a minimum of prepared foods.The recipes have stood the test of time, and in fact, I used many of these recipes when I was of full-time working woman. Time was short in those days and I had to feed my family, sometimes quickly, as I often had to attend night meetings. So between heading home from work, and heading back to work, my time to cook was short. This cookbook has many recipes that could be quickly prepared and served while using mostly basic kitchen staples.This cookbook is good for cooks and non-cooks alike as the recipes are easy to prepare, and easy to understand, if you don't know how to cook.Finally, this cookbook is also fun to read as Peg Bracken's witty writing will keep you laughing.Highly recommend."
5,For all cooks who aren't really cooking that much!,"This is the original procrastinator's dream cooking book. By today's standards this is not quite the extreme view of cooking that it once was, but is still easy, quick, and for the most part delicious. I like her simple seasoning list, and though I like to cook more than some, it's still a great book with simple recipes. Buy it and try Sunday's chicken."
2,"Read it, but you don't want to eat this food","This book is interesting as a window on what American housewives were dealing with, 50 years ago, and it made me realize how much American food and health-awareness has changed for the better! (And women's roles.) I enjoyed reading it as a cultural artifact. But the thought of making a steady diet of this food is pretty appalling. Nearly all the recipes are very heavy on the fat, salt, red meat, and cans of condensed soup figure heavily. The vegetables are canned. They should have at least removed added salt when they updated the recipes."
4,cute and funny,"This book is soo cute and funny with some interesting recipes with, of course, the sad dose of reality...that you do sometimes have to cook, to say nothing of cleaning it all up as everyone else runs for the hills as soon as its eaten! So true.That said, the recipes dont seem that much faster/ less work but I am going to give some a try as I really do HATE to cook."
4,A classic!,"I had the original years ago and misplaced it over the years. Has some very fast, easy recipes in it. We always enjoyed the A-1 Sundae Sauce on our ice cream and I have made the Saturday Chicken (I add a little white wine to the recipe) for as many as 60 plus people for special occasions. It is so easy... just serve with rice and a vegetable such as string beans. Very good recipes."
3,Too thin,"These planks are okay and do the job, but don't hold up to more than a couple of grillings, even with indirect heat. They are thin and bow during cooking"
3,Planks OK,I do so enjoy plank cooking. Camarons planks were OK but a little thin for some of my favorite planked foods. Thicker planks would have been much better for me.
4,This cd is close to being what I would call a masterpiece,"David is perhaps one of the most underrated pianist in American today. He really ownes one of the best talents I have every heard. I follow one hundred pianist and David is what I would consider elite. He is definately on my top five list.For this cd project David used a mixed bag of songs. He played a lot of patriotic songs, but also included a few choice movie tunes. I think this combiantion worked well.If you are in love with a beautiful piano this cd will be for you. You will see for yourself what David has accomplished with each song. It's hard to put to words the magnificence of these works."
2,A pianist capable of many things,"Osborne is great as far as easy listening piano goes, but there is no adventure or chancetaking going on here. I don't much like this cd, it has a certian sameness. Once you've heard the 1st and 2nd song, everything else sounds the same. VERY monotonous."
1,"I love America, but this cd isn't very romantic huh Phillip","This is a horrible cd, I l;ove America, but the msuic just plain sucks, it isn't ROMANTIC, and the songs don't flow together."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"The picture for this product is terribly deceptive. Included in the picture is what appears to be a full size sponge. It's next to the deckle which makes the deckle appear much larger than it is. The sponge is miniature, as is the deckle. Now I see in the description further down on the page that it is only a 4x4 package. The picture truly gives an optical illusion that everything is larger so I never thought to look for the size. I'd return it but after paying for shipping in both directions the few bucks I'd get back aren't worth the trip to the post office."
3,Reference to most skeletal materials of mammals,"The book is poorly bound and falls apart readily It has no index, so to find info about any animal one must flip through the book to find it. Drawings are very precise. Good section on the preparation of skeletons. I have used this book a lot and recommend it"
3,Osteology of North Western North American Mammals,"With a slightly misleading title, this book is a great reference for those looking to identify a peccary, bearded seal, or caribou. If you have cow, sheep, or pig remains, look elsewhere."
4,Lots of nice photos,"I was looking for a book with lots of photos of mammal bones, to help me ID bones that I have found. This book meets my criteria. It contains nice photos of all major bones of a wide variety of mammals. Well worth the purchase price. I also like Animal Skulls by Mark Elbroch, limited to skulls, but a masterpiece of detail."
3,It's a textbook...,"The book covered many concepts of the world of communications. I found the text to be rather slow, but I was able to continue to the end, not only for the course I bought it for, but because I am interested in the field. It is a college textbook, so the organization is a bit more formal and less reader friendly, but it has a great deal of interesting information."
1,Did not like it at all!,I use D&G Light Blue and love it! But this stuff was not very appealing at all. Thankfully I only bought a sample!
4,Baby like!!!,Have a five month old. He enjoys playing with the oball. He sometimes get frustrated because it rolls away. He is motivated to get to the ball. He moves in reverse. Once he grips it he doesn't let it go. Simple little ball has been with it for a month and still the first toy he goes for.
3,Fun toy,"I bought this for my granddaughter. I was surprised at how flimsy it seemed and got a dog toy of similar size but much heavier, which has been used more than this. Two options."
5,Perfect ball for little hands!,"My mom bought this ball for my 18 month old son who is a ball enthusiast, and he LOVES it! Unlike other balls that were either a little too big for his little hands or ended up flat or discolored after a few days, this ball has lasted and lasted and has been so good for my son's coordination because his fingers fit perfectly through the porous surface. We bought a second one for my 3 year old several weeks later and both are well-loved!"
2,too firm to squeeze or chew,"The product seems well made, but unfortunately my 6 month old doesn't enjoy it at all. The ball is too firm for him to squeeze (even though he's HUGE for his age, and very strong). And because he can't squeeze it, he can't chew it, which is what he wants to do with all his toys at this age. Maybe when he's older, he'll become more interested in it."
5,perfect,we use this in our kindergarden......its perfect for the small childreneverybody has a great time using it.....thank you for this
4,Baby loves it!,My baby just started to grab things and he can easily grab this. The reason I rated this with 4 stars is because it is cheaper to buy in stores.
3,great toy until it broke,This ball was a favorite in our house. It's shape makes it ideal for very young babies just beginning to hold objects to grab it and hang on. But after several months of ordinary play it showed up split on several seams. The company claims the ball is virtually indistructable but my kids have managed to break it.edited to add: the customer service people at this company did replace my ball and seemed very concerned and surprised that I had the problem I had with mine. They even wanted to examine my oball to see the problem it had firsthand.
1,Lasts less than 1 hour with a 12 pound Rat Terrier,"Second toy purchased by this manufacturer.Similar to the first - Sebastian the Shark, the squeaker matt did not last an hour before showing damage by my small dogs.Recommend you look elsewhere for toys given 0 for 2 on quality and durability."
4,great details on kata,"but.. i would rather suggest dvd rather than trying to read and learn from any book. best way to learn kata is, of course, from sensei at dojo."
5,An excellent and important part of the series.,"I'm a little surprised with the less than excellent reviews of this part of the series. Some complain that rather than the usual single story line (with some departures) you have distinct episodes. True, but I liked that about this book. The books in the series are all quite different from each other, but they are all true to the character and reflect the author's ability to tell a roaring good sea tale and develop characters you learn to love, despite their failings.I read this one out of sequence, so I was missing an important piece of Horatio's relationship with Lady Barbara. The last chapter, Hurricane, filled in the hole and makes me appreciate the Lady Barbara all the more.I have loved all the books in the series (I've still got one to go), but I liked this one most of all."
1,it's a dud,unit was totally blocked up upon install had to run out to home depot for quick replacement will try another brand next time
2,Not the USA Dimension Zero!,This is not the USA Electronica Dimension Zero but a swedish Death Metal band called Dimension Zero. The music downloads on here are from the USA Dimension Zero so don't be confused like I was!
2,Not USA Dimension Zero but Swedish Metal Dimension Zero!,This is not the USA Electronica Dimension Zero but a swedish Death Metal band called Dimension Zero. The music downloads on here are from the USA Dimension Zero so don't be confused like I was!
3,Nice book but...,"A great book on African game hunting with many rare photos and insightful facts. But when the writer talks about the rifles and the gunmakers, several mistakes could be easily sptted, especially on high end English rifles which are -normally- objects he just heard about or handled once rather than actually owned and used.Still, worth buying."
5,A vey fine old recording,Such a pity that a unique recording from one of the finest exponents of the classical guitar is no longer generally available
2,Doesn't Wash Well,"I received this blanket as a gift and thought it was beautiful. However, I washed it according to the directions on the tag and it had 4 holes in it when I pulled it out of the dryer."
3,GORGEOUS blanket...a liitle delicate,"I bought this blanket for my now 18 month old daughter when I was pregnant with her. It came on time, it was BEAUTIFUL, and it matched the Gossamer wings (Lambs & Ivy) nursery perfectly! My only complaint is that one corner began to unravel almost immediately from just being slung over a rocking chair! Too bad because it really was beautifully made (soft too)"
3,Old book given new life,Mr. Plamondon has taken a 1909 classic and edited it to reflect modern advances while maintaining the common sense basis of the original. His comments are bolded at the bottom of the page where needed. The original text is maintained allowing the reader to see how pastured poultry farming was done almost a hundred years ago. Recommended reading for anyone either raising free-range poultry or considering it.
5,Great Chicken/Farm Book,"This book will help anyone who thinks about using poultry for a business. The author covers the economical and practical side of the business. Even though this book was written in the early 1900s, the principles of the poultry business are still the same. The author also offers tips on how to help the hobby poultry farmer make the best use of his/her land.I would love to see someone write a modern day version of this kind of book."
4,the past - again,"This book is a wonderful history lesson through the world of raising chickens. Although many of the challenges our grandfathers faced, such as travel to market and fresh storage have changed through the years, many of the basics of fresh egg production have remained the same.We are finding that the old ways of growing chickens in the open air are better and healthier than the mega-farms so common today, and this is the book that outlines those old ways in a clear manner.Through reading this book I have been given a lot to think about as I plan my future with chickens. The author shows the profits and losses clearly and removes much of the 'romantic' idea of rearing fowl."
1,Legacy?,"As a big fan of Burle Marx, I was very hopeful for this book but ended up incredibly disappointed with it.If the legacy is that there are people still building gardens in Brazil post Burle Marx, then sure. If it is about his influence as lasting inspiration and visible in the gardens shown, then absolutely no."
2,Slow Card,I did not wanted to play all the games at higher resolution.So I exchanged for Rodeon 7500 better deal better card.Rodeon uses 7500 DDR memory this one uses SDR (slow)Geforce 4 MX uses directX7 which new card use Direct 8.1The technology on MX series is same as Geforce2 MX.Get Rodeon 7500 if you don't want to get disapointed.
3,Wished for more,"This film has a powerful message, but some of it definitely was lost in non-translation. Conversations between native speakers need subtitles so the whole story can be understood by English-speaking audiences. Otherwise, it was a richly textured story in a strikingly beautiful country wracked by turmoil and violence. Still, it was not as emotionally engaging as I expected."
3,Liam's other side,"Last year my wife and I enjoyed the best rock concert of our lives as Hothouse Flowers came to New Zealand. We are big HF fans. Liam O'Maonlai's voice with HF is powerful. It is less so with Rian, and of course, the music is vastly different being traditional Irish folk. Am I disappointed with Rian? Maybe - but I admit that I had unrealistic expectations. As it goes it is lovely Irish folk music... and the quality is great. I guess I was looking for more of Liam's passion."
3,A unique monster,"KG is one of the only authors to unleash a SUCCUBUS, a female demons that preys on mortals through their dreams. This hasn't been seen since 1975's KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER on TV. A lot of readers will be able to identify with the characters in this book as we all had a hard time in high school, but there are a few errors and strange plot twists which slightly damage the narrative. Still, Keith is a promising writer who offers fresh new themes."
4,I thought it was good. The best book would be written by her,It showed the side of her life that was good and bad. She was a wonderful person! I don't believe that she ever new how much she was loved by others. She will live on forever in our hearts. May you now rest in peace! May you always guide your wonderful son's. I hope that I meet you in my enternal life.!
3,Good book that is hard to beleive,"Donita tells a strange tale of her affair and eventual marriage to David Allen, who has a secret life of his own. This story was very hard to beleive, and even harder to beleive that it was a true story. Well written, but Donita's naivety is hard to take sometimes.The pictures are good in the middle of the book, but it would be nice to have some pictures of the victim of the murder and the victim's family."
2,URGH!,"I expected so much more from this book. With a title like ""Deadly Masquerade"" you would think there would be suspense, or at least a little thrill, involved somewhere in the book. There isn't. No wait...there was something about seeing a car parked outside, across the street. I hate to spoil it for you folks, but that's the height of the titilation in this book.This is suppose to be true life, i.e. somewhat exciting. The author really needs to take a few writing classes before trying to pen another book. The events in the author's life could have made a wonderful story. However, as I was reading this book all I wanted to do was scream! And not from the suspense! :( I'd like to say what I really think, but since I don't know the author personally, I'll keep (the rest of)my comments to myself."
4,BELIEVE IT OR NOT,"I found some of the accounts of the author assisting the police a little hard to believe but all in all I enjoyed the book. Fact is stranger than fiction. If you like true crime stories, you will like this book."
3,why not just walk away?,"Like another reviewer stated, why not just divorce her husband and walk away? The main thing that struck me was as concerned as she supposedly was about her kids safety, she put their pictures in the book!"
5,Excelente producto,"El producto llego en buenas condiciones, es un excelente calzado, a mi hijo le quedo perfecto, en verdad quede muy satisfecho"
5,The paranormal interests.,This book was a book that I came upon long time ago and at the time sparked some ideas I had in the realm of chance and probabilty since at the time I was going into the profession of gambling in Reno and Las vegas Nevada.Whatever it was that drew me to this mans ideas at the time caused me to look further into quantum mechanics and the like.THe whole thing with me is that I am a firm believer in a higher power and it could be that this higherpower is someways connected with the almighty. Sounds strange but those are my thoughts.William
3,The 3rd book in the series...,"This is the third book in the Heartskeep series. Alexis Ryder has just found, from her dying father, that she was adopted illegally. She sets off with a bloody suitcase full of money to find her real family. She meets and falls for Wyatt, a cop in the town where her family is. He mistakes her for one of her sisters and she lets him believe the lie so that she can find out more about her family and the reason why there are people after her.I enjoyed this book, especially the romance between the characters. The final book in the series usually ties it all up nicely, but I thought that in this case it was a little too pat. It wasn't that hard to figure out who did it, and all was forgiven a little too easily. A good summer read."
5,Great Read,A must read Intrigue. Dani SInclair is a very talented writer with strong plots and memorable characters!
4,After slow start wows you,"The first 2 chapters were slow, but then picked up and was Great through the rest of the book. You would enjoy this, the third book."
1,Broke with first use,"I pulled this out of the package...attached it to my aquarium and went to put a piece of veggie in...it broke into several pieces the first time even shooting a piece (or a spring) across the room, I still can't find it...it's not worth shipping back anyway. I surely wouldn't buy this again."
1,Terrible-Run don't walk from this book,"What the author should have crafted was a good book, not a retirement plan for himself.This is garbled enough to make beginner's bawk and simplisticly sanguine enough to make the more experienced choke.Either way you're better off finding the tried and true standards by authors who know their stuff and have earned the right to be read. This author has had little actual experience in this area. Read his bio which I should have done before buying this book. Caveate emptor."
4,good jewelry box,My daughter liked this box. It is very loud but it is for a 4 year old so she likes it.
4,Very pretty & stylish,Makes for a great gift for a liitle girl. This is the perfect little jewelry box for a great price.
2,Returning this,I bought this jewelry box for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas and I will be returning it. It's very cheaply made and the music would not play for more than a few seconds.
4,Very cute jewelry box,It is the perfect jewelry box for a little girl who loves fairies. It arrived fast and in great condition. I can't wait to give it to my daughter this christmas.
3,Schylling Iridescent Fairy Jewelry Box,"I was somewhat disappointed with the jewelry box. The music box itself was terrible. You couldnt tell what song it was playing, just noise. I had to replace the music box itself with an old music box that was in my jewlery box when I was a little girl. The Fairy Jewelry Box was a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday and I didnt have time to send it back."
2,disappointed,"Upon receiving the music box and opening it, I discovered that the mirror inside was mounted extremely crooked, so much so that I had to take it apart (which entailed cutting the material inside), realign it and glue it back together. After doing that, it was fine, but I knew what work I had done on it even though the recipient had no clue. It was very disappointing, to say the least. I'm only thankful that I didn't have it mailed directly to her because that would have been an utter disaster."
4,Adorable but be warned of size.,"I gave this to my daughter for her 4th bday. She loves the music and fairy and wants to sit in front of it for hours on end. It is very pretty but definitely silver in color, not blue or purple as it comes across in pictures. My only real gripe is the size, it is MUCH smaller than I realized."
3,Beautiful music box,My grand daughter loved this at first sight. It seems to be very durable. She is only 16 months old and has no trouble opening and playing it for hours.
2,jewelry box,Looks exactly like picture. Only one problem with it. The piece that starts the music box was stripped out.So I wasnt able to use the music box. I called company and they said the would exchange or refund my money. If I wanted to exchange it I had to send back and they would reimburse for the postage. To me it wasnt worth the hassle to rebox the item and take to post office to have it shipped back. I guess I would of preferred they just sent me a new one. And I could of just thrown the other away.Which In the end i did.
5,4 year old grangdaughter,Absolutely loves this jewelry box. Her sister wants one too. So I need to find something similar but unique for her
5,My niece loves it!,I have an old music box from when I was a child and my 5-year-old niece recently took notice of it. I thought it would be better to get her one of her own since she's still small and continue the tradition. She loves watching the little fairy twirl around while she pulls out her fake jewelry to put on. It's very nice quality for a child's jewelry box.
5,Just what I was looking for,Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter who takes ballet lessons. She carried it around all day on Christmas. Just what I was looking for-
1,Upset,I received this and it is broken! The doll doesn't spin right when you wind it up. I'm so disappointed.
3,It's cute,This is a cute jewelry box for a little girl. The quality isn't top notch (I think the inside of the one I bought is coming out a little and I've only opened the box once)but it's good enough my little flower girl. I really didn't want a shiny jewelry box but the fairy ballerina was the decision maker for me.
2,"Very pretty, Fairy doesn't spin","Ordered this as a Christmas gift for our granddaughter, and the fairy hitches and stops while spinning. Unacceptable for a little girls Christmas present. It is really a lovely box, too bad I got one that doesn't play right. I have to return this."
2,Lasted a few days,"This is a really cute little jewelry box, but the dancer and latch broke in no time at all. The box is still intact so that's good. My 5-year-old daughter is very careful with her things, but after a few minutes the wings popped off the ballerina and then a little while later the whole girl came out. I was really hoping this would last longer than it did."
4,I love this book.,"Another amazing book by Mr. Arnold. Bruce knows damn well that most guitarists are self-taught, and therefore don't have the same music theory training that other instrumentalists do. This book is his response. In an easy to understand manner, Bruce has the reader learning music theory, how to build chords, and all in a workbook/quiz-like manner that is both challenging and enriching. I have used this book, and found that my guitar playing has improved because of it. I recommend this book to anyone aspiring to be a great player of ANY genre."
4,lots of useful exercises,"This is a huge book with a ton of exercises. My only complaint is that the exercises are introduced without much explanation. There are about fifteen pages of explanation at the beginning, and then 100 pages of exercises. If you aren't prepared to dive right in to this book, then I'd suggest starting out with the Guitar Fretboard Workbook by Barrett Tagliarino, which contains less exercises but more thorough explanations. That way when you open this book, you'll already know what to expect and can move right along."
1,Dry and unimaginative as the dullest textbook you remember,"I have been a guitarist for 25 years, albeit an unharolded one, and I bought this book with the intent of polishing my skills. I have just finished the introductory theory section pracitcally needing toothpicks to keep my eyes open. Do you remember the highschool or college class where you thought the subject sounded thrilling but the textbook was stultifyingly dull? This is it! This is certainly a ""work"" book that will take the ""playing"" out of your guitar sessions"
2,Disappointed,"I've read the good reviews here and thought I'll give this book a try.First of all, the quality of the book is pretty bad. It's almost impossible to read some of the diagrams. I wouldn't mind if it was a $5 book, but for over $30 I expected something different and much better quality.In addition, the buyer should be aware that this book very dull. It explains music theory in a very boring, straightforward way and will not let you practice any tunes while using it. It's just a workbook with many writing exercises, nothing more.It's probably good to the most serious students out there, but for me it will never be a pleasure to use this book as other books which actually teach you how to play between one theory to the other.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are a really serious musician that is willing to spend much time on writing exercises."
2,"Mysic Theory Workbook for Guitar, Volume 1","If you are looking for a good read and lots of information stay away from these books. I purchased both I & II on the expectation of reading about theory. There is not really a whole lot of text in the ""texts"". They consist mostly of work problems to be tab'ed and/or noted after the initial twenty, or so, pages of written text. I was very disapointed."
5,Sounds of the 70's,Great condition! Enjoyed listening to the songs of days gone by. Great music and recommend this to everyone. wonderful Music not to be lost.
4,Excellent Mikimoto Character Designs,"This is a far above average anime with character designs by the legendary Haruhiko Mikimoto (Macross, Orguss, Gunbuster, and many others). It has an intriguing story and beautiful effects."
5,Blue Remains,This is a wonderful movie. I highly recommend it to everyone. It is full of wonder and beautiful animation that will awe you. The story line will keep you watching till the end. Enjoy!
1,damn your band name,WHY DO ALL THE GOOD BAND NAMES HAVE TO BE TAKEN? YOU SUCK WHOEVER YOU AR!@!!!DAMN YOU!!!
4,Mimic Blu-Ray,"I liked this blu-ray directors cut for the super clear widescreen anamorphic picture, but they cut other key scenes out to put in a silly preganancy sub plot, overall the original version was much scarier and better done, they should have included the original version on the disc,they didnt so i bought the canadian blu-ray now i have both versions on blu-ray the original is the better version!"
4,formulaic but still quite engrossing,"Yeah, it was predictable. Yeah, it was formulaic. Yeah, it was a bit slow in parts. But dammit if it wasn't CREEPY as all hell! The brooding atmosphere was enough to keep me scared. Not to mention --- Jeremy Northam is a BABE."
2,Waste of talent,"Here is a classic example of excelent talent mixed with a terrible plot. This movie is awful, don't waste your time"
3,Times Change and What Was Scary in the 90's is not now.,"Times Change and What Was Scary in the 90's is not now. The special effects are really good but I could not get past Mira Sorvino's really bland performance. Twice she was supposed to be crying but she was just not convincing. As the movie went on, I was kind of hoping ""they"" would get her. Overall not a bad movie with an interesting storyline but the acting was pretty bad. Miro was the worst but you had to buy a lot elsewhere too. I mean Jeremy Northam threatening Charles Dutton? Really. I think in life Charles would have smacked Jeremy upside his head. On the other hand, they had a great actor in Murray F. Abram and wasted him in little more than a cameo. So if you don't mind really bad, over the top acting and a dated movie, go for it."
3,Good up until that final scene...,"Mimic could have been so much more... Everything seems good untill the last fourth of the movie. The story of how the bugs came to be is semi-plausible, as is the rest of the story. The finale is somewhat bland, with the whole lower subway (Read no further if you don't want the ending spoiled) going up in an explosion and all the bugs are killed. But, even though Mira Sorvino's husband set off the blast, he somehow emerges from the rubble slightly charred. This scene completely ruined the movie for me and made me lose all credibility in the story. Besides, movies like this shouldn't have a happy ending. Oh well... Mimic however is still a worthy watch."
4,Fun movie,"You could see that this movie was trying to be different, and it succeeded. It dealt with genetic engineering and the fact that sometimes what seems like a beneficial discovery might turn out to not be so good at the end, showing us that we have to be careful with science."
3,mimic,This is movie is different. It is kind of scary especially the sound the creature makes. I think it was okay.
5,great movie!!,I really enjoyed this movie it's a cool mix between sci-fi and horror over all I am very pleased with my purchase and the movie.
3,Needs a director's cut.,"I liked a lot about this movie when I saw it, but I wasn't surprised when I heard Del Toro say the studio had basically ruined his movie. If there is the material to complete the film correctly, then a director's cut is in order. I can't say if this would make it one of his best films, but it has great potential."
1,ANOTHER clichéd genetic mutant movie!,"Boy, I'm tired of these kinds of movies. Completely unoriginal. A hokey premiss about an impossible mutation. Actors whose only emotion is annoyance. All the characters's actions are wrong and stupid actions. Lots of impossible, unworkable coincidences. The romantic leads survive, everyone else dies, just like in every other disaster movie ever made. This is probably the most slime-filled movie I've ever seen (Ghostbusters 2 may have had more slime, but it was FUN slime!). But genetic mutant monster movies were all the rage back then, so everyone seemed to love it. I sure didn't."
1,Mimic uses every gimmick,"Mimic is a giant bug ovie that is neither entertaining nor scary, featuring characters we couldn't care in the least about. The only reason to see Mimic is because of good monster design and effects."
3,Mimics other bug movies,"Guillermo del Toro's effectively creepy bug movie is a fast-paced, exciting (and gooey) thriller starring Mira Sorvino. However the film has a mainly ""been there, done that"" story about a deadly virus called Strickler's disease, that is killing many children, and Sorvino's character finds a cure by genetically- modifying cockroaches. The nasty critters get set free in the world, and several years later people start getting picked off by giant bugs that have evolved to ""mimic"" their predator: Man.The action, which mostly resides in the trademark underground railway tunnel, is inventive, and there are some genuine shocks and twists along the way. The messing with nature theme has been done before (Jurassic Park), and the film is very similar to The Relic. But there is a strong environmental message that, while good, thankfully isn't heavy-handed and doesn't get in the way of some cool bug-splosions and hapless kids getting munched. Disgusting fun."
3,Good movie that has some great moments.,"This movie was sorta wierd. First, the acting was good. Mira Survino and the others did a fine job. The story's mood is right for its plot. It usually dark and gloomy. There is alot of blood in some parts but if you know what this movie is about, you'd expect it. Its aa good horror/action movie. It kinda grossed me out though :-) Alot of bugs and slimy things everywhere. Over all...good movie. END"
2,not good to me,"This is where Hollywood movies started to go wrong. Mimic stinks.Dramatic music for every action scene intended to make the film seem more important than it really is, a bad storyline that tries to succeed by covering it up with special effects, and poor acting all around.The only part I liked was the predictable segment where the one woman was examining a baby roach (that was actually huge) and it jumped up and pinched her hand. Other scenes throughout the film just felt really exaggerated.It's not a scary movie, it's not gripping, and it's not particularly good either. It features a slow build-up type of suspense that misses the mark more than anything else. Perhaps a less exaggerated storyline could have saved it, but I have a feeling it *still* would have been boring because of the slow pacing in the beginning and the overly dramatic soundtrack. A perfect case of Hollywood special effect abuse."
4,A superb creature feature,"I have reviewed ""Mimic"" before but here's the bluray review. ""Mimic looks amazing on bluray. Filmic, light grain , and terrific color saturation. The SD version of the movie had the quality of a TV movie; artificiallly brightened and color timed...this is the definitive version, The ""Director's Cut"" mainly includes additional character bits and some bits of plot. These add texture to an already great film. The 1080p image is superb, but the sound is amazing...pulsing, ambient, and loud...this version is miles above the SD version. Highly recommended."
2,Disgustingly boring,"I rented this movie one day, watched it, and absolutely hated it.This has to be the most predictable, poorly written ""suspense"" movie I've ever seen. I wasn't thrilled or horrified at any given point throughout the entire thing, and almost fell asleep in front of my TV in the middle of it.Definately don't buy this, in fact, don't even bother RENTING this."
3,It has some suspenseful moments. It's worth watching once.,"It has some suspenseful moments. It's worth watching once. However, there are a lot of familiar scenes I've already seen in other movies. It's worth watching once."
3,Mimic,"Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has made his American film debut an exciting, old-fashioned monster movie that unapologetically harkens back to the ""giant bug"" epics of the 1950s. Genetic engineer Sorvino is part of a team of scientists who concoct a designer predator to combat a virulent disease carried by New York City cockroaches; unfortunately, after three years the cure proves much worse than the affliction. The film's first half lags slightly, but leads to a slam-bang suspense finale in the bowels of the city subway system. Impressive special effects and an exceptionally sneaky performance from Charles Dutton. Director: Guillermo del Toro. Cast: Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin, Charles Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini, F. Murray Abraham. Rated R for violence, gore, and profanity. 105 minutes."
2,eeh,"I'm sure it is a good item, my problem is that it is not user friendly and the setup it to much effort. I'm not lazy, i'm not using this system again, i'm selling this unit and hope someone will have great success with it"
3,"Tricky at first, but finally got it","I installed the incorrect driver at first install, so I contacted the company and they responded with which one to use. They have an office in the U.S., and that is the one I contacted. They have both an e-mail and a phone number that you can use to contact them. I chose to e-mail, and received a response within 12 hours. YOU NEED TO INSTALL THE 901SP DRIVER. I uninstalled the old driver, ran the software again and chose the different driver. So far, so good!"
5,A WONDERFULLY OBSERVED NOVEL,"Spiotta paints a compelling portrait of characters caught up in the cultural fevers, protests and disaffections of the 1970s and 90s. I look forward to more novels from her."
3,"Slow going, but worth reading 'til the end.","Someone at Starbucks gave me this book and I'm not one to turn down a free book. Although this isn't the typical genre I read I decided to give it a chance. I complained during the whole thing and I have to admit that about 175 pages through is when I actually started to get interested. I do like how it pieces together.I'll recommend to those who have a great knowledge of vocabulary and enjoy books that keep you wondering, ""huh?"", ""why?"", ""who?"" and in the end explain it all. :)"
2,Unreadable,"I bought this book because the NY Times recommended it. As and ex-radical, SDS'er I'm very interested in the topic but the writing is dull and drags and is putting me to sleep. I don't know if I can even finish it."
2,Oversold,"Reviewers' raves -- particularly the NY Times' -- prompted my purchase and expectation...and disappointment. While the writing is stylish, the plot is so obvious as to remove the incentive to turn the page."
5,Fkn A!!!!,"Adequate and well made / durable. Crank pulley bolts are mostly what i have been using it for and haven't had any problems with it. I used just the driven section (the piece w/ 1/2"" square drive) and a hammer to loosen and tighten an axle nut on a Jeep on one of my side jobs. If you are a Mechanic (yes, capital M, *not* small m mechanic) you might want one of these hangin around your box no matter what. And to the other reviewer who will not buy one but reviewed this tool anyway --- say WHAT??"
1,"This review is for the seller/listing, not the item itself","The description header for this item says ""Grabber Outdoors Peel N Stick 12 Hour Body Warmers - 1 Box of 40"" (this is an actual cut and paste). It also says ""list price $67.95 reduced to $5.02, saving $62.93"". I knew it was too good to be true, but I went ahead and purchased on the off chance that it was a bargain. I ended up being right and I got one packet, for which I seriously overpaid. When you can buy an actual box of 40 of these same warmers from another vendor here on Amazon and pay $37.50, it means I paid 5x the cost. I knew it was a gamble, and only a $5 one at that, so I was aware of what I was doing. However, I suggest the seller and/or Amazon change this listing so it not misleading. The product itself is great, just know that you will only be getting one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Murder, politics and revenge.This series is set in the Tsurani world of Kelewan, so is somewhat different to the Midkemia adventures. Their society is somewhat like feudal Japan's. The focus is on a young woman whose family is murdered because of political machinations that are desirous of obtaining her family interests.To regain her power she has to employ some lateral thinking and employ the very few resources she has left to claw her way back."
4,Feminine influence,"As a Riftwar fan, I was excited to read Daughter of the Empire when I first saw it, but I did not anticipate the influence Janny Wurts would have on the storytelling. Not that she did a poor job, quite the contrary. She added a feminine touch that helped me identify with Mara, ruling Lady of the Acoma, as I rarely do with fiction novels. Much more like an epic saga than a fantasy novel, I sometimes wonder if Feist hasn't actually found a rift and seen this world of Kelewan. The two master storytellers paint a world with vivid descriptions and a tale woven of fine yet powerful threads."
4,Intrigue and suprise,"I really enjoyed this offshoot story, it was full of twists and turns that kept my eyes glued to the page. I strongly recommend this and any other book written by Raymond E Feist."
1,horrible,If you like Feist book's then you will not like this one. Under no cercomstances will you like this book. It was poorly written and extremly boring. Only get this book if have nothing to do and are bored.
3,Do these two really like each other?,"Part two of a three-part series, the Bride Hunt brings together two very unlikely characters. Common enough plot device - but in this case you really just wonder if they'll end up hating each other in a year or so. This book was definitely written with more care and consideration of the plot than The Bachelor List (part one of the series), so kudos for that. I think that with about 50 more pages I might have been made to believe that these two belong together - but ultimately, there just wasn't enough. I do have to admit that I'll be out in April to buy the third installment - the male character (briefly revealed in this book) looks a bit different, and interesting. Let's hope third time is a charm."
1,Jane Feather is no Jane Austen,"There were three story lines in this book, and none of them were very interesting. The story of the three sisters' relationship to each other and their matchmaking service had the potential to be amusing (as a similar story was done so well in Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice), but instead was lifeless and plodding. The second story about the civil suit and trial was trite and unrealistic. And the third story, the romance between Gideon and Prudence, suffered from a lack of development. They didn't spend much time together as a couple because Prudence was always with her sisters or working on the newspaper or trial.Altogether, this book put me off Jane Feather. I doubt that I'll try another one of Feather's books anytime soon, if at all."
5,all,Im a new stamp collector so i would like to review all titles. Please help. Thanks in advance.With our best regardsJacky
1,disappointing,"I picked up this book, thinking it would be a fun to send my daughter who is in Europe on a student exchange, for Halloween.I was disappointed to see, not only that the vast majority of the book was about NYC, but that, in the one story about our city, the name was consistently spelled incorrectly (Binghamton does NOT have a P in it). This lent zero credibility to the rest of the book.Being a life long resident of the area, I still could not figure out where the stretch of highway the author was referring to was. After researching the local 'lore, I was able to figure the story out, but not from this book."
5,I was there!,"I was there when the paranormal investigator was at Orchard Hall, which is featured on page 126 of this book. I myself frequent this establishment (Bowling every Thursday!), and have experienced very similar instances such as are mentioned in this story. Much more could be added. I am looking forward to visiting more of the establishmentst that Ms. Smitten wrote about. WONDERFUL book! Well worth the price."
1,Another Disappointment,I was at first heartened to see a newcomer to the Cisco Certification publishing arena so I immediately purchased this book. However I concerned when I realized all the authors it had and I was unimpressed when I started reading it. The 'voice' of the book is inconsistent from chapter to chapter so I never knew what to expect. That is *not* a feeling I want when preparing for a such an important like the CCIE test. I could deal with these issues however the technical inaccuracies remind me of the Giles CCIE Book from McGraw-Hill. If you can't get Proxy ARP correct..... I doubt everything else.
3,"Great book for trivia, but not the single source answer...","I'd put this on my CCIE reading list as a good collection of trivia, but you'll need other books in the wings to back you up. Even with the breadth of topics covered, there were details I haven't found in my other readings. There are some errors, and some of the subjects aren't covered well (like BGP), but it was still a good read. It's worth the price..."
3,Good for overview.... not preparation....,"This book will *NOT* get you through the exam... unless you use some other study material too. What most people do is that they do NOT look at the SUGGESTED study material at the Cisco website for the Routing/Switching paper. If you do, your odds of getting through in the written paper are very high. This book is good as an over-view.... but ... that's it ;-)."
3,Not a sole reference - missing important info,"This book alone will not take you through the 350-001 exam despite its name and claim. Aside from the multiple errors (errors in a tech book are good for you if you CATCH them), the book is just plain missing enough information to fail you: details on ipxwan, details on RIF behavior when using DLSw, details on advanced BGP options. Definitely a good intro, but do NOT stop there. Try the web study zones for a REALLY good source."
1,"Brian X Barretto (CCNA,CCDA,CCNP,MCSE,MCSE+Internet)",A total disappointment Cisco should ban these books for the following reasons 1)It just gives an overview just enough to pass a CCNA exam 2)The CD ROM does not contain challenging questions the CCNP exam had more challenging questions than the CD ROM 3)It gives you a false sense of achievement making you feel that reading this book is all that there is to Pass believe me I have done a number of cisco certifications and it is not that easy.
1,Not worth the time or money!,"The book is a sketchy, high level overview. The CD test is the real reason I bought this book, and that proved to be very disappointing. Multiple obvious errors on simple topics, which means none of the test info can be relied upon.None of the authors names are displayed with their certifications - guess after turning out such a lousy product they are keeping a low profile."
2,Not enough,"Book covers all topics, but not in enough depth. Practice test on the CD is MUCH easier than the real thing."
4,Excellent Review Book If You Have Completed A CCNP,"This is an excellent review book for CCIE Written Test, if you have just passed all the 4 CCNP tests. If you want to bypass the CCNP and take the CCIE written directly, this is not the book for you. I believe the book assumes you have the knowledge equivalent to CCNP. It follows the CCIE Written Test objectives closely and does not get into indepth explanation, but it mentions all the facts you need to remember in a very concise fashion. You could then go back to you CCNP books and brush up on areas that you think you need more detail. You will certainly need more detail from other sources on Erlang B, Bridging, and RIF. I found a few errors, but you will know this if you are a CCNP. Buy it if you need 2 weeks to quickly brush up for the CCIE written."
1,one of the worst books to use for the ccie,"You will not pass your written if you use this book to study. I have caught major errors and this book writer had the technical apptitude of a CCNA. The book crosses TCP and UDP ports on a regular basis and the Author has obviously never used or implemented a large scale network. Use the All-in-One by Giles (2nd edition is current Rev)If you use this book, use it to test your knowledge and take its content lightly."
4,Very decent book,"I used this book to assist me in my studies for the 350-001 exam. And I did pass. As others have stated this test is not like other Cisco tests. This test is a test on the your understanding of networking principles and theories.Anyway this book is good at what it is intended for. Inside the 1st chapter it says that this book is not intended to be used as your sole source for the exam study. This is true. It is GREAT at reviewing the concepts necessary to pass this exam.I did email the authors and publishing company asking where the errata was located. No response. There are a few errors in this book, which you will notice right away if you understand the technologies..."
5,"Capote's ""first"" non-fiction masterwork","Long before ""In Cold Blood,"" Capote mastered the form of the non-fiction novel with this stunning little work. This story follows Truman to Russia on the first cultural exchange between our two countires - a touring company of ""Porgy and Bess."" This book is much lighter in tone and premise than ""In Cold Blood."" Capote is in perfect pitch here. If ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is one of your favorites, as it is most assuredly one of mine, you will adore this book. Don't miss it."
4,Well made,This is a new tool for us. In fact as I write this we haven't put it to use yet.I was concerned when ordering about how well the wooden handle was attached. I'm happy to report that I'm satisfied that the attachment is long lasting.
1,"Get the 7 Inch, not this one.","I'll admit it, I wasn't paying attention to the size and reviews when I ordered. I thought it would be bigger and it's my fault for the 1 star rating. I hold myself accountable, not the product.Ignore all the reviews where everyone says, ""I'm glad I didn't get the bigger one."" I can only assume they're speaking out of buyer's remorse too. Well, I'm not shy to admit I have remorse and wanted the bigger one.Look, if you you boil your pasta in 9.5""+ pot like most everyone in the modern world then the 7 Inch spider fits better. The whole purpose of this device is to get as much as possible with one scoop to supplicant the use of a strainer or Colander.The 5"" spider is still a well made piece for the price. If you truly want a 5"" spider then buy with confidence and in your mind my review can be that of 5 stars."
4,Good value,"Used it a couple times so far for deep frying. The head's wide enough to scoop out most anything you throw in there, and the handle's long enough to reach down into our dutch oven."
4,"Spider Strainer, 5""","I searched for this item specifically because I thought it would be an excellent tool for french fries and donuts, including the donut holes. I am so impressed! It fits in the top rack of my dishwasher so I know it is completely clean for the next time."
5,"Nice size, good quality","good quality, and was exactly what I was expecting. Cant ask for anything more! My guess is it will last a good year with repeated use"
5,Helen Chen's Asian Kitchen 5-inch Spider Strainer,I purchase it because it came with the Fry Daddy's that i purchase. It does everything I wanted to do and more.
5,So many uses,"You can't imagine all the uses you will find for this. Lifting out hard boiled eggs, tempura, etc. Nice to have!"
5,husband's fav,He had been looking for one of these for a long time. I was happy to have found it here.
5,it is excellent for what I needed for,I make a lot of foods that need to come out of the juice. It is so much easier than tongs and a regular slotted spoon
5,Seems Great!,It came very fast and is EXACTLY as specified. I can tell it will last a long time as it's sturdy and constructed very well. I also love that it's dishwasher safe. Very happy customer!
5,Super scooper.,Very practical for my wok cooking. I like the size because its just ideal and easy for me to use. Deep frying and stir frys are my forte.
4,Works great.,This skimmer works great. The 'bowl' area is nice and large and the handle is at a great angle for retrieving things from hot oil.
1,"Totally forgettable, Unfortunately","I really liked Platypus' Ice Cycles (at least the first half). This one is, however, forgettable. It has a few good licks but nothing catchy tyhat I remember like ""Better Left Unsaid"" from Ice Cycles. I think I listened to this CD two times max."
5,the real deal,"sadly, what we have here is a great rock album that will slip into musical oblivion. The masses dont want anything genuine. If the music rocks, then its time to push it to the backburner because garbage like blink 182, nickleback and the wallflowers need the floor space. Shame cause this album is better than anything those cover boys ever put out. Ty tabor lets out some real growl on songs such as 'No remedy'. The band shows its tight with 'the jelly jam' and brings it all home with ""under the tree""."
2,Contour Butterfly 3-in-1 Massage pillow,"For using just to keep your heels off the bed, it's great. However, the battery container has to be pulled out of its glued in posistion in order to insert batteries (bad design) and the battery connections fall out and/or disconnect every time you move the pillow to a different position. (bad design)"
1,A Piece of Junk,"This item is a piece of junk. I had a hard time opening the battery box. Once I did get it open and had put the batteries in, it was very hard to close. I gave it an extra push, and the batteries popped out, along with the springs, and the battery box itself got a crack in it. Thus, the massage is unusuable. The item is not worth the price. I have returned it for a refund."
1,Not Happy At All With This Contour Pillow - A Waste of Money,I ordered 2 of these pillows for my husband and me. They were very hard and they almost felt like bricks. The motor would not work on the massager so my husband had to pull out his tool kit and it finally worked. It is so bulky that we couldn't use it at all. The only reason we didn't send it back was that we thought it would be unsanitary if they were to resell it later. So we threw them away.
3,Somewhat what wanted,"I bought this mainly for foot pain and to use between my knees for sleeping. So far it has served its purpose. The only complaint I have is that the batteries were difficult to put in, actually to open the battery compartment. The cover of the pillow doesn't go on as well as it was on prior to you having to remove part of it to get to the battery compartment and the Velcro on both sides doesn't line up anymore. Other than that is is a 3 star product, not great, but not bad."
1,very disappointed,"Very poor quality - definately not worth the cost. The massage function is as good as useless - pillow itself a good shape to use, but way overpriced for what it is"
5,Peek a block:sensory black and white blocks,These blocks are wonderful...The contrasting colors keeps baby fascinated for a long time. They are a perfect size for little ones to be able to hold. Our grandson loves these blocks.
3,Where are the women?,"I haven't read the others in this series, but I bought the book because I expected it to have a view of Rome from the women's perspective--sort of like Marion Zimmer Bradley giving the women's view of the Camelot legend. In this I was disappointed.If you don't have some knowledge of Roman life and government, you're going to find yourself struggling in a few places.The book isn't BAD, but neither was it as engaging as I thought it would be."
1,Boring!,"I never thought I would say ""boring"" about a historical novel so well researched and based solidly on fact. The characters never come alive for me - there is no one I can ""root"" for. The detail is simply overwhelming - you can't see the forest for the trees. The graphic sex I could do without.I studied Latin many years ago and found the characters and setting quite familiar, and indeed, looked forward to reading more of Miss McCullough's books in this series.In my humble opinion, Miss McCullough should write either history, biography, or novels that are true literature. This one fails on all fronts.I read for escape, entertainment, education, enlightenment or elucidation. Time is short and there are so many readable good books yet to read. This book is not one of them."
4,A Soap,"A soap opera for the classic age. That's the best way I can think of to explain ""Caesar's Women"" by Colleen McCullough. Lots of political intrigue, and lots of sleeping around with just enough murder and war thrown in to keep thing interesting. I found it hard to keep track of all the lesser characters whose name where all so similar. I do love the way Ms McCullough writes, this being the first of her books I've ever tried. This subject matter could have a long difficult read, but it was enjoyable and even light reading"
5,"as historical novels go, little short of miraculous","I have never read a better series of historical novels than Colleen McCullough's ""Masters of Rome."" As both an enthusiastic fiction reader and a doctoral student in history, I stand in awe. To recreate a historical period in the kind of living detail McCullough provides is a daunting task; to do it and to make it riveting is little short of miraculous. I discovered these books recently and out of order, and immediately had to buy all five; when ""Caesar"" ended after the battle of Pharsalus, I promptly got online to find out when the next book was coming out, and was very relieved to discover that I have only two months to wait. It seems a very long time. All intelligent readers of historical fiction owe Ms. McCullough a debt of gratitude for producing art of this caliber."
3,Et Tu Colleen?,"Wonderful book detailing the continued rise and rise of Gaius Julius Caesar, who comes across as a type of Machiavelli at times, and at other times a 'teflon don'of ancient Rome. Great insight into how roman women lived, a forgotten part of history.A good follow up to the previous books in the series."
2,"Not too bad, but the series continues to decline","I really enjoyed the First Man in Rome, and while I still follow the series and moderately enjoy reading the stuff, it's certainly not a patch on Robert Graves for quality of writing or Suetoneus, Plutarch, Asimov, or any of the many good histories of Rome as history. If you have a real enthusiasm for the period, the setting alone may well overcome the absurdly modern dialogue and the considerable obviousness of the plot development - and the book is by no means bad. However, in my opinion the imagination and the thoroghly researched historical setting, which were the hallmarks of the first book, have declined considerably in subsequent volumes."
2,Learn to edit your material,"Colleen McCullough is certainly able to research a topic and write about it at length-but editing and continuity of story line are regrettably lacking. I struggled for awhile and gave up, exhausted from trying to digest all the historical events, characters and anecdotes crammed into each paragraph."
5,A must read,"I have been reading McCullough's ""Master's of Rome"" series this past year. Although you could read ""Caesar's Women"" as a stand alone book, I believe you would be missing the fullness of its history by doing so. It is built upon the foundation of the previous books in the series and is a testament to the author's ability to bring history to life. Her attention to detail and impeccable research make ""Caesar's Women"" a must read.This book is centered around the main women in Caesar's life including his mother, his wives, and his mistresses. It is filled with passion and politics, a stark reminder that some things never change."
4,Excellent story,"Colleen McCullough has written another excellent book, this one about the women in Julius Caeser's life. She did a masterful job of spinning the story of how these women vied for power and influence over him, and described effectively the world and the societal situation that women lived in at that time."
3,Interesting characters and boring history lessons,"This would have been a terrific book if only McCullough had stuck to writing about Caesar's Women. I enjoyed reading about them. But the long, never ending descriptions of politics made me want to beat my head against a wall. This book is an unhappy marriage of boring history and interesting characters. McCullough is a solid writer capable of telling a good story but she takes herself way too seriously here. I was only going to give this one two stars but she has obviously worked so hard I gave her three."
4,best of the series...so far,"This is the best of McCullough's Masters of Rome series so far. It helps if you've studied Roman History, taken Latin, and aren't prudish - sex is very much a part of life in this Rome. Definitely not a book for casual entertainment purposes."
3,Evidence of real historical digging!,"Ms. McCullough's novel was a real insight, especially into the lives of Roman women. I especially enjoyed the depiction of Julius Caesar's daughter, Julia. (Actually, she was the most sensitive, heart-warming character in the book!) The historical ""digging"" that McCullough has done is really astounding! I appreciated the glossery in the back, that pretty much has you speaking Latin by the time you finish the book! What I didn't care for was her overall ""cold"" characterizations. I refuse to believe that Julia was the only truly KIND person in Rome in the 1st century BC! And I have no clue where McCullough got her depiction of Marcus Antonius (Marc Antony). Though it's true that he was involved in some riotously hard living (probably due to a very troubled childhood!), I don't think any of his busts indicate that he was ugly! Most likely, he was one of the handsomest men in Rome. The rest of the book was engaging, though. A fun summer read."
4,A treat each week,"The Weekly Telegraph is a treat each week. Whether you are a UK ex-pat, otherwise interested in UK affairs, or want a different perspective on world events the Weekly Telegraph is for you. While it may seem a bit pricey for an annual subscription, the money is well spent - especially if you want a real paper in your hands rather than trying to read your news of a screen."
5,Nice Fit,"I bought this for my Ford Ranger XLT. I was concerned with the fit for the XLT because that model was not listed but the fit is excellent, more overlap and protection than some other models I have looked at. Can not comment on the quality or how well it will hold up, because I have no experience with any wear and tear as of yet."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this for a Canon 30D because I shoot low light situations. I have had success with Sigma lenses before so I thought this would be a good lense to have. It is extremely slow to react and to auto focus and my low light photos actually did not come out any better than with previous lenses. I think it is better suited for portraits than action shots. If I had used this previously, I would not have purchased it."
4,Works Pain Free,"I have used both these programs on VHS and they work great! This workout gave me visible results without making me sore or stiff - a rarety for me as I have back problems. Tony does babble his way through the tape so once you get used to the routine you may want your own music playing in the background. Overall I thought this was a great workout and is VERY do-able for people like me who are in no shape to get into shape. Although I highly recommend this DVD set, it will likely be too low key for those who are already very physically fit. These DVD's are great for slimming your tummy and just getting moving, but they are not going to thrill those who hit the gym 4 nights a week."
4,Men should get revenge on all girls,When Kogame and Kikyo were traped inside the cave with that monster that feeds on priestesses I wish they both would of gotten eating up espically after Kogame was saying we don't need Inuyasha's help just because she got mad at him when he didn't like Kogames cooking. He can't help it it's good to be honiest. Why would Inuyashs be concern after Kogame said the stupid sit command three times. Songo got the nerves to laugh after Inuyasha went on a walk.
3,adc advantage Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,This Monitor has worked fine for me It keeps a historyof all taken. Be sure that you are quiet when taking Blood Pressure. It is more accurate if you stay very still for 1 or 2 minutes. It is giving me a good record to go with to my doctor. Would buy again. The price was very right
3,Nice machine.. but did not get the one in the picture (still model 6015 though),"I got this from Amazon for 29.99 shipped, so I cannot complain. It does not look like the picture however. My model number IS the ADC 6015. Not sure if it is an old version of it or what... The biggest difference is it only has a memory of 30 blood pressure readings. Otherwise it seems to work fine. For $29.99 I was expecting a basic machine..and that is what I got, so I cannot complain. I think this listing should be updated to reflect the actual one being recieved. though."
3,Lie down!!,"The device is easy to use, but you need to lie down and relax, follow the directions exactly; otherwise, you're going to scare yourself into a stroke, because the reading will be crazy."
4,follow instructions...works fine,"as is usually the case, the unit works fine if instructions followed for positioning of device on the forearm and positioning of the patient.used appropriately, it can assist in monitoring blood pressure meds or in stress management relaxation techniques."
1,Dirt.,"It's not that complicated, I brewed this tea and it had a very strong, moldy dirt smell that was a big turn-off. I tasted it nonetheless, and guess what? It tasted like dirt too. This isn't the very worst of it. The worst of it all is that the seller doesn't accept refunds. So I'm stuck with this dirt-tea which is pretty much useless to me. I was satisfied with Prince of Peace's Oolong tea though."
5,Pu-erh Tea,I love this tea. I use it instead of coffee right now. It is smooth and taste great. I would recommed it to others.
4,Just what I ordered,Good product. Just as I ordered. Taste is ok. I bought because Dr. Oz said to use for weight loss. No luck yet.
5,GREAT LIGHT TASTING BLACK TEA,"My sister recommended this tea to me after watching a Dr. Oz program and I decided to try it. I love teas of all kinds, especially flavored tea. This black tea is light in flavor and very refreshing as an ice tea. I have not tried it hot as yet but I am sure I will enjoy it just as well. It does help in keeping my blood sugar levels down and at the same time quenches my thirst and hunger. I drink it during a meal and then again about an hour after the meal as is recommended for fat burning purposes. I have not seen any significant results in the fat burning properties but then again all things do take a bit of time. I do like the purity of the tea and I was pleased to learn that Prince of Peace is a Christian company and I like the fact I am helping support a Christian business. If you like tea and enjoy black tea then I recommend this tea over any other."
1,Think my Pu erh was bad,"This is (was) my first time to try Pu erh so I have nothing to compare it to but from everything I read, it is supposed to aid in digestion which is just the opposite effect I got every time I drank it. Every time I have drank the tea, I get a pain in my diaphragm like I have to burp but can't. I thought it was something I ate so I tested the theory. I quit drinking the tea and felt okay, I have drank the tea every few days without changing anything else in my diet, and every time I have drank the tea the same thing occurs.Not sure if this has happened to anyone else while drinking this brand. I probably should buy some other Pu erh and try it but I'm a little hesitant now."
4,Good Tea,"I ordered this tea because I saw something on Dr. Oz about drinking Pu Erh tea as part of a weight loss tea drinking regimen. I liked the flavor of the tea. I did not however see the supposed weight loss effects of the whole tea drinking thing. I will not blame the tea for that, though. there are too many variables as to why I did not see the results. As for the tea, it seemed to be a little stronger than a regular black tea such as Lipton's or something comparable and I enjoyed that. I would definitely consider ordering this tea again when I finish the box I have."
2,Reorder???,"I absolutely hate the taste of this tea, but if it would work, I would get it again. Couldn't find it anywhere else, but I think it is too expensive."
4,Unique flavor,"This is a tea with supposed health benefits. However, it has a unique, somewhat smokey flavor this is OK. It is not a tea that I would automatically reach for time and time again."
5,a cupa tea for two,This is a hardy tea with an earthy after taste. Try with lemon to lighten this brew. I like this tea for an afternoon pick me up or evening while watching tv. Best served hot. Packaging was good and arrived on time.
4,good solid shoe,"good solid shoe, looks great, the tongue moves quite a bit, but good comfortable shoe, hanging tuff with my GBX shoes of similar looks..."
4,Enjoyable Adventure,I can usually count on John Vornholt for a good Star Trek adventure. And he comes through again in this two book offering. Book 1 leaves you hanging and anxious for the conclusion so be sure to have both on hand when you start these satisfying novels.
4,Excellent Story,"I really enjoyed this book. One of the better Trek novels I have read in some time. I particularly enjoyed the use of many familiar, but non-regular trek characters from TNG series and Trek movies. Waiting for part two will be hard as I just have to see how this turns out!"
4,Awesome,I enjoyed this book and just like a season ending episode of TNG it leaves one hanging. :-) Im on to book 2 now.
2,Good story but gets basic facts wrong.,"The Genesis Wave Book 1 has a good story line but it has flaws.Firstly why the 6 month wait for book 2 to come out?Secondly I agree this could have been made into 1 book. the only reason for it to be a 2 parter is greed.Thirdly it makes mistakes with its description of the defiant class ships, for example it says the bridge is on deck 2 while it is on deck 1. The crew of a Defiant class ship is said to be 10 when it is approximatly 45-50 and these are just a couple of errors."
2,Too Unlikely,"John Vornholt forgets one of the most important aspects of Star Trek - you have to make the science believable. The problem with the Genesis Wave is that waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Vornholt nowhere explains how the wave travels at warp speed. Also, when it goes through a star system it seems to slow down (also unexplained). Lastly, it threatens earth but originates from a far corner of the Federation. It would take months (if not years) to travel that distance at the highest warp speeds. Vornholt does not offer an explanation for this either. This was one of the most disappointing series of Star Trek books that I have ever read."
4,The Colour of Midnight by Robyn Donald (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:""I'm Stella's sister ..."" And Minerva Robertson wanted to know why, with everything to live for, Stella had chosen to end her life. The only person who might be able to give her an answer was wickedly attractive Nick Peveril, Stella's husband. But he wasn't the conventional grieving widower ... What was Minerva to make of him? And should she fight the passion she felt for him?"
4,SOLID!,"Outside of the usual suspects (""And the Beat Goes On,"" ""Fantastic Voyage,"" etc.), this CD is worth picking up for the lesser known gems.""Come Back Lover, Come Back"" is a most EXCELLENT tune from the Sylvers. Leon had become an in house producer for Solar at this point in time and his siblings followed him over there in 1981. This gem was the first single off of the ""Concept"" LP and should have performed much better than it did. It's good to see it listed on this CD."
4,Solid Comp From An Underappreciated Label,"For the money (some vendors sell for under $10), the Solar Disco Box is an excellent bargain. Lots of key tracks and rarities. There are some major hits missing, especially from Shalamar, the label's biggest act, but this is a really fun listen that will take you back to those Jheri Curl days. Grab it before it goes out of print."
5,awesome!,"Seven Mary Three is the best band ever. Their combination of slow songs and songs like Cumbersome really shows their diversity as a band. That is what most people look for today in music, a variety. It goes with their moods, happy, sad, and angry. The song Devil's Holy Joke has turned into my theme, along with Lucky. I hope that they continue to create great music like this for years to come."
5,An album you can Feel,"Wow what to say about this album. This is my favorite album by far. It came to me in a time of my life when things were really messed up and I took to it. I could really relate to it. It has so much to say. Total emotion! If your like me and love melodic music, music that makes you really think, take you on a trip in your own mind. This is it. I am telling you, give this album a listen, you wont regret it! Maybe it can reach to you like it has to me. I could just really go on for hours about this album, but I can't so give it a listen and see what I am raving about! A great band, with so much to say and offer. These guys are going to be around a long time!"
3,Just ok,"This is Seven Mary Three worst album in my eyes. Dont get me wrong all three albums rock! Yet this ablum I thought could have used some improvments. This best song is ""Lucky"". Only buy this ablum if you are a die-hard SMT fan."
2,This cd is a struggle to listen to,Musically I guess some parts of the cd are alright but it just does not go together properly. The singers voice in Seven Mary Three is way to scratchy for my liking. This cd is a struggle to listen to.
2,sophomore slump,"The first album was good, but about the only thing this CD has going for it is the song ""Needle Can't Burn."" The band would do much better on its next two CDs."
3,deep theories to wade through,"Another welcomed translation of the French scholar, Jean-Pierre Vernant. Building on his previous book ""Origens of Greek Thought"", Vernant expands to look at Greek society more fully. Overall there is a lack of primary evidence and refernces however that weaken his intriguing suggestions. Not for the non-specialist."
2,Poorly made,"I SO wanted to love this blender. I make smoothies and salsa daily and replaced the Tribest with another personal blender. Initially, I was very impressed with the sharpness of the blades and the ease of how well everything blended. This blender, however did not last long, I assumed I had done something wrong and purchased another. The new one worked for only three weeks when things started to fall apart. Over the next 4 months I had multiple parts replaced (I will say the customer service was good and quick to send replacement parts). I followed the directions meticulously (not blending more than 60sec ect), however in less than one year the thing fell apart again. I will NOT purchase this one again, am going back to the Magic Bullet. If you buy this KEEP THE WARRANTY."
2,Disappointed after reading all those great reviews,"I started out with a $20 smoothie maker from GNC that worked reasonably well (it always left one ice cube uncrushed for some reason) until the motor burned out 2 months after I got it. So I ordered the Tribest which had awesome reviews. The problem is, mine just don't want to blend. I put in frozen strawberries & bananas with yogurt and I'd say this only blends about half of the ingredients, even when I stop it and stir up the ingredients myself. If I try adding ice to the equation...forget it. The ice just bangs around ineffectually. The blend seems to have good speed though so I'm really not sure what the problem is. Everyone else seems quite happy with it."
5,Excellent Blender,Excellent product. My wife uses it several times a day and it has not broken or malfunctioned. Easy to use and easy to clean. The whole family has begun using it and we have purchased another unit to keep at work. Highly recomended.
2,Didn't hold up,"I got this blender with high hopes of really having something with staying power. I got it about a year ago and it is already headed to the junkyard. It smells of smoke when it runs, the sealing ring around the top has already come off (into my smoothie - had to throw it out and start over) and the whole thing just doesn't work very well. I wouldn't buy another Tribest."
4,Wow! I love this blender!,"This thing works like a champ! I break out my blender at least twice a day and I have always had a really difficult time finding a blender that doesn't leave huge chunks of ice in my protein shakes but now my search is over :) I don't know if it's the shape of the cup or the blades or what, but it blends everything to a perfectly smooth homogenous consistency. I only wish it came with larger cups. You may want to consider purchasing the XL cup seperately. All in all, I highly recommend this product to anyone."
2,Disappointed in Personal Blender,"I am very disappointed in this product because it is not capable of performing the task of creating smoothies as described in the advertisements. I tried using it with fruits and greens but it left tiny pieces of the fruits and greens in the drink, and it was not enjoyable to drink. Maybe it works well if you want to use it with juices rather than the full fruits and greens. I do not recommend this product because it seems to lack the power it is advertised to have."
3,It's good-- small and not too powerful,"This is a fine product if you're not putting too many things into the blender. It's not great but for simple things, it's good enough. I use it primarily for smoothies and i have to stop and move around the fruit in there to make sure it gets blended evenly so it's a bit annoying but its fine."
5,Powerful and petite,"Two reasons I selected the Tribest Personal Blender; 1)It fits in my suitcase and doesn't take too much room, 2)consumer feedback rated this one as a great performer with powerful S-blade assembly. Great at crushing ice. I've used it over dozen times and am very pleased. Rate it a 10."
4,blends well,"so far this product is working well. Thorough mixing of ingredients; easy to clean; overall very pleased with the product. However, I've only had it for a few weeks and I am hoping / trusting the product will work this well for many years. So far - so good - definately worth the price."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very, very disappointed with the performance of the Tribest blender. I bought it to blend breakfast smoothies....nothing fancy....just some protein powder and soy milk. I even bought the larger cup. The unit is very, very under powered. Did NOT mix the ingredients. Had to transfer everything to my larger, more ""industrial"" blender. Would not recommend this unit for any serious blending. Save your money or put it towards a better unit. This product is a rip off. Does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder."
2,Description Misleading,"Be aware that the description of contents on Amazon's site describes the PB-200 which has 2 8oz chopping cups. If you look CAREFULLY at the ID number it mentions PB-100 which does not include these items. The only way you would know this is wrong is if you went to the MFG site and researched the product ID. So you will NOT receive the 2 smaller cups. Also, the 16 oz size is not as much of an issue as the poor narrow design which makes it difficult to make anything if you are adding ice. The ice will take up space before chopping and not allow as many liquids as 16 ozs should handle. If you want to make anything substantial you better plan on order the XL container."
5,Charming story about what a baby monster is afraid of,The Boy Under The Bed is a charming story. My Four year old loves baby monster Giles. He especially loves the illustrations of the great tree house in the sky where all the boys live.I like the way the story teaches children to conquer their fears. The Boy Under The Bed is imaginative and fun. A great bed time story.
2,Reimagining Christianity,"Bought this book for an after church discussion group. Was not interested to start with and it went downhill after that. No new ideas, merely a set of quotations from other writers. Nothing from this author ever again!!!"
2,Nice and Good Value at First Then it Doesn't Work,"I bought this printer new and was satisfied with the purchase (even though it made loud clanky noises when it printed) until just about within 14 months after purchase, it will not feed the paper through. It picks it up the sheet and just jams. I tried different weight paper, filling up the tray to the top, half-way, still will not pick up. I haven't even used up and any of the original 4 toner cartridges!!! By an HP if you can. My old 1996 HP LaserJet 6L is still working after going through three toner cartridges."
1,Pass this one up!,"While the low price for a color laser printer may draw you in, steer clear of this one!I have spent countless reams of paper thanks to this printer getting an error close to the end of the print and all data that should have been spooled was lost...so it's back to square one.I have no problems with the print quality nor the cost of consumables. My problem is with the printer itself and the fact that once it has an error...consider your entire print job lost.You get what you pay for. With this printer, you'll quickly find that out once you lose a few important documents.This will be my last Konica/Minolta printer. I don't have the time or resources to see a document lost after going through all of the motions it takes to get this printer to operate.Caveat Emptor...Enough said by me."
1,Poor engineered and designed,"Printer is extremely noisy. Like other oldies, it needs to warm up for a while before printing. During the warm up process, the printer clicks, clicks, ticks, ticks, and makes lound noise that could wake up your whole family during the night. Paper jam is constant due to poor engineering of the paper pick up mechanism. After dealing with paper jam problems for a while, you will get sick and tired of this printer. Frequent pulling of the jammed papers out of the roller, will damage the sensor and thus making the paper jam error becomes permanent. One last thing, the cartridge is insanely expensive. The cost of these toners is more than buying a new color laser printer of other brands. At this writing, this printer has been long discontinued. However, do not buy this printer if you find it somewhere else or you will regret it. (I guessed those engineers/ designers of this printer have also been fired)"
2,20 lb paper and nothing else,"Decent color. Noisy, slow, and will NOT accept anything heavier than 20 lb paper. If that's all you use then it is an ok printer. Great for letterhead printing (then send the letterhead through your B/W laser), but won't do your envelopes. Oh yeah, the cancel button does nothing at all as far as I can tell."
1,Can only use on thin 20lb paper,"Very poor design. As a number of reviewers have mentioned, printing on any kind of quality paper confuses the Konica, which will go into ""jam"" mode and not feed the paper properly. And who wants to print professional color copies on flimsy, cheap paper? This is sporadic and I have not found a way to ""jimmy"" the way the paper feeds to correct it.The print color quality is very good.. but so what, since you can get it to feed decent paper (i.e. 24 lb or 28 lb stock)It is also the noisiest printer in existance.Fianlly, the paper tray is very flimsy and juts out..easy to snap or break. Forget this manufacturer. No quality control or interest in same."
1,Worst printer I've ever used!,"This is a wonderful printer- if you want to print on 8 1/2 x 11 paper and do nothing else. I have called support twice and been told: you can't use it with non windows xp software (you can- I figured it out myself), you can't print on post office postcards, you can't print on laser checks, you can't print on most anything! I find it jams constantly (except that letter paper!) and it's brain scrambles every time envelopes are printed (which it mangles fairly well- and yes, I move the little buttons back to do it!)requiring that it and the computer be shut down before it will work again. Save your money. I've got to junk this 9 month old printer and go out and buy a new one. HP always did all of the above- I guess I've learned my lesson!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I set the printer up in my home office two years ago and have used this printer extensively. I HATE IT. Yes, it prints out pages rapidly and has been a ""workhorse,"" I suppose, but not a well-behaved one - and certainly not an inexpensive one. While the initial price tag was attractive, I have spent an average of $600-700 PER YEAR for print cartridges etc - the cost of supplies alone has exceeded the original value of the printer many, many times over. I have found that the lifetime of the cartidges is far less than advertised - even for the high capacity cartridges. The printer is loud, fussy, messy, and the print quality is just okay. I'm taking my useless piece of technology to the trash heap momentarily ... and believe me, I will be celebrating."
1,This is being returned,"I did my homework and read many reviews. Not one mentioned that you can not share this printer. I didn't need network ready, but I do need to share with my home network. This is an important consideration and should be noted in the specifications.Also, no one mentioned that to print an envelope I would have to remove all the paper, open the cover, adjust 2 levers, close the cover, load the envelope, print and do it all again to replace the paper. What a hassle!One last complaint, and I read about that one. This is one very noisy printer. Don't expect to print while you are on the phone. Neither of you will be able to hear.On the plus side, the print quality was good.Overall, the negatives are not worth the cheap price!"
2,Magicolor 2400W - Disaster,"Having owned and operated a Konica-Minolta Magicolor 2400W for the last year and a half I am not surprised this item has been discontinued by the manufacturer. I purchased a brand new unit which promptly broke down in days of installation. Minolta did replace it with a REFURBISHED unit. Strange, I bought new and they replaced it with a used unit.The printer is incredibly noisy and dirty - it spills a lot of toner inside the printer so you get to clean it frequently if you want clean printing. The toner is outrageously expensive. Replacing all four toner cartridges is more expensive than buying a new printer.Break downs and error messages are a fact of life with this printer. Konica Minolta's web page help site is of no help what so ever. Unless you somehow forgot to remove the packing tape when you first installed the unit, all help does in recommend you call customer service.After 18 months of repeated frustration I pulled the plug and went with HP color laser printer."
5,Best Chronicle Yet!,"I loved this Chronicle! I had no idea what to expect but this was awsome! It gives you a better sense of who Ellimist is and he doesn't seem all that different form all the other central characters of the other Chronicles. It will explain why he sometimes refers to himself as ""i"" and other times as ""we"". I loved this book so much that after I read it once, the next day I read it again. NOT a disappointment AT ALL! KAA should be very proud of herself for coming up with such a cool approach to such a mysterious character!"
5,Very good,"This one explained many of the things about what the Ellimist did and why he did them. After I read this book, it gave me a completely different view of the Ellimist. Before, he seemed like just a petty character, but later I knew he was more careless than unimportant. You definitly should read this if you are a fan of the Animorphs."
2,A little tooooo out there,"Toomin, aka Ellimist in the games, flees for his life with a handful of survivors from his home planet of Ketran when it is destroyed by aliens. He becomes a hunter, a prisoner, and a skilled game player, and finally the hunted. Vast space and time lose the reader, but this book explains other references in the animorph series. Seems to be for animorph diehard fans only..."
5,Very interesting,"It perplexes me to find out these books are aimed at children. Some of KA's work is so deep and dark, I wonder how alot of these kids can take/understand it."
5,Devil of a good time...,"A vast majority of Coop's art featured in Devil's Advocate are, in actuality, posters the artist was commissioned to create for various rock shows and punk concerts, with the challenging task of grabbing the attention of casual passers-by and hopefully get them to attend whatever concert or event they're promoting.In this task you'll discover that Coop's posters more than succeed in catching your eye, in fact, they demand you stop and look!Such posters include aliens wrestling with curvy female astronauts, a sleek Creature from the Black Lagoon, babes with hot rods, tiki temptresses and Betty page-esque hotties flirting at you from the poster in luscious color.From another artist, all of this could of come across as vulgar and cheap, but instead, it oozes raw sexuality and is just a heck of a lot of fun. Don't miss out."
1,never get magnetic for electronics,you should never use magnetic tools on electronics - the magnetic field can erase code stored in chips that is needed to run your suff then you will have more problemsthe set looks good but would be better if not magnetici work with electronics all the time and know the damage missing code in different chips can do and magnetic fields erase data stored in them
1,Heads stripped within 10 minutes,"My 2-year old son stuck something into my Wii's disc drive, and it got stuck. I had to purchase a tri-wing screwdriver to open up my Wii to remove the item. I bought this because it was the cheapest item, and assumed that a screwdriver wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong.This item is the biggest piece of crap I've ever bought on Amazon. The screwdriver heads are made up of cheap metal that bend and strip right out of the box. I got a few screws out of my Wii and the head had stripped so much that the screwdriver was useless, and I couldn't put the Wii back together.I had to buy a different set of tri-wing screwdrivers, and wait additional time for them to arrive before I could finally fix my Wii.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP SCREWDRIVER!"
1,poor quality,this screwdriver set is worth about .99 cents not $10 or whatever I paid for it...DO NOT BUY!!! I wouldn't purchase this again for sure
1,"Awful, just awful","Stay away! This is some of the cheapest hardware I have ever experienced. This is NOT magnetic tip as I thought by the title. I threw this set away after five minutes of using it, cheap plastic and ever cheaper bits."
1,awful!,The blue screwdriver had blue residue coming off of it and onto my hands. The bits were made so poorly that they were shredding when used. The reason I bought it was to use the 3-sided bit for the Nintendo ds. THE BIT WAS TOO BIG!!! It had the advertisement of the nintendo ds on it's discription and it would not work! The bit was so fragile that tiny bits of metal (If that is what it was made of)were everywhere. I definately would NOT recommend this to anyone. Next time I will spend more money for something better.
2,Cool but wrong,"It was nice to order this set with all the possible drivers that could be used on various items, but for the Nintendo DS the tri-wing bit was the wrong size, and there weren't any other sizes to use. the bits were too big. I had to take the game system to a real repair man as a result of not having the right size."
3,As expected,"This product is exactly as described. A little flimsy and probably can't take too much abuse, but I am only working with my Nintendo and Samsung digital camera. I am sure if I was repairing them for a living, I would buy a professional set. This does what I needed it to do for dirt cheap ans rec'd it in 2 days."
2,Bits do not fit,This product is not worth the price of returning it due to the very low price.The bits fall to the floor every time one lowers it.The bits do not lock into place in the handle.They loosely slide into place and fall out if one doe'snt hold the handle upright at all times.This is really out of the question.Truly a piece of junk.You truly get what you pay for.
1,Worthless,"I was looking for an affordable magnetic screwdriver set for general computer repair, etc. I should have trusted the prior reviews.The driver is made of cheap plastic and surely will easily break or wear-out. The bits are 1/4"" (not a common size), so it will be difficult finding another driver for that bit size.I'll be spending a few dollars extra and getting another set."
1,Not as advertized and a cheap product,"This item is described as using 1/4"" bits, but does not. The bits are 3mm which is about 1/8"" and do not fit properly. Also this is not magnetic. I would consider this junk status.If there was only a way to rate it at less then one or any stars"
1,Looks like Dollar Store Quality,"Not a quality tool.Quality is equal to tools of the Dollar Store.Some of my bits were missing.Have not used tool, but may work in a pinch."
3,its okay...,"this screwdriver set has a great assortment of bits, but the handle itself lost its magnet after only one or two uses, and now the bits wont stay in place to use...bummer. but, I was able to use it on what i bought it for before it became useless, so its not a major loss."
1,Garbage,"The title says it's good for the Wii, I don't think this screwdriver is good for anything, let alone the Wii. Which by the way, the set does not come with the tri-wing adapter. do not waste your money on this set."
2,Should have read the reviews first!,"As most of the other reviews say...there is NOT a tri-wing screwdriver in this set that will work to repair a Wii. I normally read reviews on items before purchasing but I guess I figured it was cheap and all I need was the tri wing....Anyway, what I want to say is that I left a seller review, which is apparently different than the product reviews. The seller, Zitrade, contacted me after they saw that I was disappointed with the product. They offered to refund my money, if I would remove my review. I have decided not to remove the review, nothing against the seller, but this item is complete junk. I did tell the seller that I thought they should discontinue selling this product, as it has created many negative reviews. My point is, the seller seems like a decent person, concerned about customer satisfaction. This is a cheap item, and sometimes ""you get what you pay for."""
2,Misrepresented,This product in fact does not work for opening a DS Lite. The TRIWING tip is to big to remotly fit into the screw holes. I would not recommend buying this if you intend on using it for a DS Lite. It may work for other products though as I have not tested it for them.
2,garbage,"what do you expect from a dirt cheap item. its really useless, my kids have toys that looks better and real than this. don't waste your money."
1,poor review,did not have the tri wing screw tip had to order a single one cost me time and money....poor review
4,Great for the money!,"The bits are NOT magnetic. There is a magnet to hold in the bits but they DON'T hold on to the screws. The variety of bits are excellent - according to my husband. I just wish it had a nicer case.*When the package first arrived, the case was completely open and ALL the bits were scattered around the box. Thank goodness I didn't lose any. Also, the screwdriver looked used and scratched (unlike the picture) but it may be supposed to look like that, regardless, it didn't effect the screwdrivers performance."
4,The bits work,"The truth is that if you have a good grade screwdriver with a good grip, these bits do work. The bits in the set are a mite thinner and shorter than comparative bits for this purpose, which poses a little bit of a challenge, but it can be done and upgrading or replacing a component is rather simple with it. However, I will reiterate to use a good grade screwdriver, and not the one that comes in the case (think of it as the cheap jack that comes with a car, where taking and using a good one is always the better choice) to avoid anything camming out. The bits can work for notebook/netbook upgrades or general repair, but for game console work, stick to another set. With that, these bits work really well, come in handy, and for the price, I think that I would recommend them to others."
2,Not terrible,"This set provides a large variety, but does not hold up well at all. Both the tri-wing and t6 bits have been stripped and are useless now after only a few jobs. If you want something that lasts, dont get this. If you need variety for only a handful of jobs, this may be good for you.Dont expect it to be able to handle older tight screws. That is how my bits were stripped."
3,not the best option for working on a Wii,"I bought this specifically because it called out that it had the tri wing screwdriver to be used on a Wii. While it has the bit you cannot use it on 2 of the screws when opening the Wii. There are 2 screws that require a long narrow shaft / bit and while I was able to get it to work with my crazy mcgyver mojo, the average person should just buy the correct single 3+ inch tri wing screwdriver. Go to youtube and watch a video on opening the wii and you will see what I am talking about. If you need it for something other than the Wii it should work for you."
3,A quick fix,"A good enough set of tools in my opinion. Exactly what I needed to replace the screen on my Nintendo DS. Crazy low price, quick delivery, a good purchase."
4,"Cheap screwdriver, odd tips.","You can't go wrong with this. It is cheapo, it looks cheap, it feels cheap, it's cheap. But you have a lot of tips that you won't find anyday, so even if it is cheap, it still has some value on it.But you will still need a jeweller's screwdriver set or even a knife for some things, because this kit is not complete. It is missing small, very small Philips tips, just like the ones in the Nintendo Wii. It is missing small slotted tips. At least those are easier to get; this is the first time I have a Tri-Wing tip.Get it. It's cheap. At least it's cheap."
4,Surprisingly useful,"I actually can't remember why I initially purchased this set. I know it was because of a specific bit that came with the handle, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was. Since purchasing it, I can't believe how much I've used it. The one really big negative is that the case it comes in is somewhat flimsy. It's easy to accidentally send all of the bits flying if you open it too quickly. But with a little bit of care, this has really turned into one of the tools in my home that I use the most. I'm always looking for it. And thankfully, it's always right where I left it."
1,Disappointed with Tri wing!,"Should have read other reviews. Bought this seeing ""Nintendo Wii"". Did not work for me. And the tool tip is flimsy!"
2,works in a bind,this is what it says it is and nothing more. it will work in a bind but not an item you want to trust. the bits are about half the size length and width of standard bits. the whole package thing is made out of cheap materials. if it is something you are going to use everyday look else where. if you need it for a quick repair on a single item them it should easily do you well. also be ready to repack it. the container that it ships is similar in quality to those used for the lower end laser pointers. the bits do not stay in their spots and the lid just sets into place. no locks or hinges of any sort. anything more than a few bucks and you are going to feel ripped of.
1,magnetic screwdriver set,"My screwedriver set does not look exactly like the picture here, and they werent magnetic. I received 2 of these items and on opening up one, the case was broken. When I tried to put the tips into the handle, they didn't fit. The second case opened up unbroken, but the tips didnt fit into the handle either.Both were a waste of money! I threw them both away!"
5,Great Book,"I have loved the Hornblower books since I was a kid many many years ago. Having just discovered them again for my Kindle, I am excited to start reading them again. Hornblower is a very complicated individual and the Royal Navy of the late 1700's early 1800's as seen through his eyes brings that period to life. Anyone who is interested in the sea, the days of the wooden warships, the reign of the British Empire, and just good adventure will love these books."
4,Great!,"""Hornblower and the Hotspur"" I found to be the best of the Hornblower prequels. I have yet to read the books from ""Beat to Quarters"" on. ""Hotspur"" relates Hornblowers carreer aboard H.M. Sloop-of-War Hotspur, his own prize. Lt. H's daring blockade of Brest takes up most of the story.If you have enjoyed any of the young Hornblower stories, continue with ""Hotspur"". If you haven't read any of them, I'd start with ""Mr. Midshipman""."
2,The heart cut out of a great story.,"I love every volume in the Hornblower series, and purchasedthis audio edition in a bookstore with the anticipation of enjoyingthem again driving around in the car. The audio cassette was well produced and very well read. It was with growing shock, however, that I realized that the parts I loved most had been cut out of this edition: the bare bones of the action remained, but the heart and soul of Hornblower had been snipped away. ...I encourage everyone to read Hornblower: these books have enriched my life and brought me hours of joy. But I would avoid these audio editions."
4,Nicely done,In the Hornblower series this one came across well for me. It's not as impossible or contrived as some were and I found it a pleasantly OK story.
4,Fictional navel history,"C.S. Foster brings Hornblower to life. You can live the life of a sailor in thelate 1700,s and early 1800's through reading his novels. When you have completed the 11 Hornblower's series try Alexander Kent's Bolitho series."
1,Throwing Up In My Mouth,"Why can't I give this 0 stars?I will start out by saying that I have not listened to a single second fo this album. But I do not feel that this disqualifies me from reviewing this moist turd. Ashlee Simpson is the prime example of what is wrong with the music industry and it is an absolute travesty if anyone buys this mess. She is so untalented that it hurts when I pee. It would be understandable if the was remotely attractive, or had big cans, but even that isn't the case.Buying this album is akin to supporting terrorism."
5,Ashlee Simpson ROCKS!!,"Ashlee Simpson is a great singer. I just love her.""I am Me"" is waaay better than her first record, ""Autobiography"", and it is a must-buy. Every song has a great beat and the lyrics to most of the songs are amazing!!"
2,"Pathetic attempt, but at least some addicting songs",She can't sign worth a bag of beans. But at least she sucks.
2,Disappointing,"I love Ashlee Simpson. But I can't say I exactly enjoyed her 2nd album. All the songs sounded pretty much the same to me. There were some good ones, like In Another Life and Boyfriend. But then there were some that were down right annoying, such as Burning Up and L.O.V.E. They were by far the worst songs on the album. I don't think this album really sounds like her. Overall this CD was nothing outstanding and was just crap you could listne to anywhere else on the radio. This was frankly disapointing and I expected a little more from her."
1,In response to Omar Ernesto Ramirez Luna's question...,"Earlier today, I read a prior review from a reviewer wondering why we hate Ashlee Simpson.Well, the answers is simple:1. She can't sing at all and people know it. If she can sing she wouldn't need modern technology and computer fixings on the microphone to cover up her terrible singing notes. Ask the 70,000+ people who attended the 2005 Orange Bowl halftime show where Ashlee performed at.2. The Saturday Night Live incident. Need we say more?3. Piss-poor lyrics. For example: ""You can throw me like a boomerang, I'll come back and beat you up"" (from Autobiography).Does that answer your question?"
3,vailtrail.com/ weekly shuffle/ CD Review by Samantha Donen,"1. Ashlee Simpon, I Am MeAshlee appears to be a bit indecisive in her second album. The first track, Boyfriend, is a hit and will be rocking dance floors across the nation for sure. But the younger Simpson explores too many musical styles in I Am Me, from dance hall and hip hop to pop rock and Nora Jones'-styled ballads. Perhaps the perfect album for her fan base, young girls, who can listen to the album's varied musical tastes. Web link: ashleesimpson.com."
3,Wow..harsh criticism for no reason.,"Granted, Ashlee is no Jessica; but I dont really think they are in a competition. Now let's get to the music. It's pop...pure pop. At a mere 21 years-old, the girl is experimenting with who she might be. The taste in haircolor vaires as much as her music on the cd. There's rompingly catchy songs: ""Boyfriend"", ""L.O.V.E."", ""Burnin Up""; an 80's throwback ""Dancin Alone"" which sounds like Depeche Mode is playing back-up synths. And even though she strains her vocals on ballads ""Beautifully Broken"" and ""Catch Me When I Fall"", she just sounds raspy not terrible. Remember this is not JESSICA Simpson. The album isnt all that bad; my biggest complaint is the 39 minutes it spans. Um last time I checked, an album usually clocks in around an hour...let's get our money's worth here."
4,"Admit it, it's a good album","OK, so Ashlee may not have an amazingly good voice. Maybe she IS famous only because of her sister. But even so, this is a very good album. It isn't just mindless pop music. It has feeling to it. Just listen to tracks like ""Beautifully Broken"" and say she has no talent. ""Talent"" doesn't necessarily mean an absolutely amazing voice.Give this CD a chance. It's definitely one of my favorites.Best tracks: Beautifully Broken, Boyfriend, I Am MeWorst tracks: L.O.V.E., Burnin' Up"
4,"The ""I Am Me"" albums invisible song","I recently heard Ashlee Simpson's new song ""Invisible"" when I saw the video for it. It claims that the song is off of her new album ""I Am Me."" But I have had this album since it first came out,have heard the whole thing from start to finish many times, & I have never heard this song before last week. I even double checked the ""I Am Me"" CD, and let the Cd run at the end, to see if maybe it was a hidden track. The Song Does NOT exsist on this album! At least not the one I have.There isn't even a single out for it. Maybe it's another one of Ashlee's Celebrity Ooops. If anyone can solve this mystery, please let me know where the location of this invisible song is on this album."
1,MUSIC TODAY SUCKS!!! ... AND SO DOES ASHLEE!,"What in hell is this world coming to? Why is this girl still recording?! SHE SUCKS BIG TIME!!! This album is bad, bad, bad!Where have all the real talented people have gone? Why do we have to put up with this horses%$#@?!!! Enough already. Flush this one!"
4,Well....It could have been better,"When I bought this album, i expected the same, well, rock/pop as the first album. But, unfortunetly only about 4 of those tracks are rock/pop. The others sound WAY outr of line for Ashlee Simpson. I rate this 4 stars because these tracks are GREAT!1. Boyfriend2. L.O.V.E3. Burning up4. Dancing AloneBut, if by any odd reason Ashlee Simpson is reading this(I mean why would she want to go on amazon to bye her album? she probably has a million copies)she should go back to her punk. I like it more, and it suits her best. She is a good artist...just not at very slow songs."
2,kids stuff....,"If you wanna blow your money on someone that doesn't have all that much talent and if you like your rock a little light,then go ahead and buy this predictable cd....Why is she popular,I have no idea..This is for kids only...nothing new,nothing groundbreaking,nothing exciting about any of this..."
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF HARD EARNED MONEY!,This CD isn't worth the plastic disc it's written on! Typical on ANY of her albums. She is and always will be a no-talent screaming BIMBO!
2,This Sounds Familiar...,"This time, Ashlee has a new hair color, she wears more mascara to go with her goth-inspired outfit, and she is, er, ""real"". She really, really wants you and me to know this. After that unspeakable fiasco where her world fell from the sky and she cried more than she had ever cried before, she has managed to bounce back and present us with I Am Me. She's turned her negative into a positive, risen like a phoenix from the ashes, and kudos to the girl for milking it for all it's worth.The most contrived album of the year, perhaps...Scratch through the wafer-thin pseudo punk/rock chick veneer and you will find Autobiography, Part 2. Putting aside my sudden loss of respect for Ms Simpson, there is no denying there are some catchy tunes on I Am Me that are very radio friendly and bound to do well. But at the end of the day it's simply more of the same with Ashlee trying be to deep and failing miserably. Pretending to be something she's not. Better luck next time."
1,Music for the people in america that killed jesus!,good grief is this bad. pull your heads out of your asses and listen to somebody you like. Not some big shot piece of garbage telling you whats in and whats not.
1,what a joke.,"do you all remember that episode of her show on mtv?(mtv SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)you know?that one when she was complaining about her manager wanting her to sound more pop.she said;i dont wannabe like hilary duff!i wannabe rock!that's what i am!thats the music i love!yeah, right,what rock do you like ashy?jesse mccartney?mudonna?ppppphhhhfffff!!!!c'mon ashy washy!YOU DONT EVEN WRITE YOUR OWN SONGS YOU RETARD!!!!!!!!!!!one kid was talking about how great she is,and his review was titled ashlee rocks!an he was talking about anyone who was saying she was bad was wrong.yeah right!yer wrong you retard!shes also a horrible singer!whatever ya do stay away from:ashlee simpson,jessica simpson,(who?)lindsay lohan,justin timberlake an most of all,MTV(I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU!)"
1,She need to stop with this.,"People think Ashlee is so cool because she has a rock-edge. FYI. NO SHE DOESN'T. This isn't rock, it's staight out pop, and you know what it totally blows."
1,Give us a break already!!!!!!!,"As expected, Ashlee did not take the advice of those who signed her ""stop Ashlee petition"" which is very unfortunate. As also expected, her new ""album"" has a 3 star rating already, but I'm not shocked, considering that her other pathetic excuse for a CD also got high ratings. Maybe another petition can save the world from a third album from this big-nosed, disqustingly straw-like haired skank.Boyfriend is the only track I've heard from this, and that was enough to keep me away. The song is exceedingly lacking lyrically and it is BORING!!! How many times do we need to hear this loser squawk out ""Didn't steal your boryfriend...oh-oh, oh-oh....""? Not to mention the obvious sh***y, and rangeless vocals that Ms. Simpson has forced upon the listeners. But wait, Papa Simpson will be quick to point out that ""she has acid reflux!"" Yeah, yeah........we believe you.....NOT! Bottom line, she just can't sing..."
2,She tries hard...,I have to give her 2 stars for 2 things.1. Having the guts to release a new album2. Changing her hair color back to blonde.Other than that...she really needs to work her vocals she sounds like she is screaming a lot instead of singing. I give her props for actually trying?
1,Don't go Away angry...Just Go Away,"What exactly does it take for someone to take a hint?As much as Ashlee does try and try she just is not that talented.Whatever that ""it"" quality is, she just does not have it.As much her father tries to spin an web of depth to her image it just is not there. There is no shame in walking away and trying something that she is more suited for.May I suggest a career in the wonderful world of welding?"
1,"Ashlee Simpson, go back to your hoe-down dance!","I thought by listening to this album, I might have some sort of sense that maybe she finally put out a nice album. However, with first listens to ""Boyfriend"", I wanted to literally throw up. I bought a used CD at Target, as it was only $4.99. All I can say is that after 2 full listens (as I tried my best to really like it), I have to say I am appalled on the angsty and tweenie songs that came out. Needless to say, I took the CD and thoroughly placed it near the end of my car, and ""accidentally"" ran it over. I honestly think Ashlee should consider just being an actress, because no matter how many excuses she makes for her ""flaws"", she still cannot sing."
1,"I am me, you are you...","MAN, Ashlee Simpson can't sing. She sounds like a sick horse. If you appreciate any sort of music whatsoever, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Simpson's voice is shockingly raspy and hoarse in contrast to clueless sister Jessica's operatic (in comparision) shriek.And don't worry, she doesn't seem to have developed much as a songwriter, with lyrics such as: 'Well I'm sorry/That he called/ me/And that I answered the telephone'. But the worst song on the album has to be Hollaback Girl rip-off 'L.O.V.E.'. Simpson's vocals are more horrendous than ever, combined with a nightmare-ishly cheesy melody and goofy lyrics.I feel bad for Ashlee. No one will ever take her seriously as a performer and she is stuck with that grating voice for her whole life. She should stick to doing hoedowns."
1,Finally,"FINALLY!!!!!!!!!! Another Ashlee Simpson CD. OMG OMG OMG, I'm so excited. I can't wait to melt my golfball sized brain listening to this garbage. Thank gawd for Ashlee Simpson. OMG, I love this cd, OMG, Ashlee rules, OMG this is good music, OMG...............................wait a minute, what am I talking about? ASHLEE SIMPSON SUCKS! What kind of idiot would buy this junk? Let alone give it a good review."
1,Karaoke anybody??,"This girl isn't even Karaoke Bar talented. Worse than that: AMERICAN IDOL AUDITIONS sucky!! If there was a worse thing I could think of, she'd be that too!! This CD is TERRIBLE her label is trying to cover up Ashlees lack-of-vocal-abilities with loud music. Pop is good, Ashlee is not. She has the morals of an alley cat, the honesty of Bill Clinton. Even if you are a fan of either of them(I'm not here to judge) you have to admit that they BOTH ARE LIARS and should be held accoutable for their actions.My not so humble opinion, is that they both are just these losers with a big mouths and who will eventually just go away."
1,"Hmmm, let's see now...","...Vomit-inducing, uninspired, soulless, corporate, pungent, petulant, fake, evil, painful, mindless, selfish, sordid, mind-numbing, repulsive, disgusting, piss-poor, inane, wretched...I could go on all day."
1,She made a 2ND album?,"LMAO. All else that needs to be said is that someone has said this is the ""best album they've ever heard"". It made me s**t myself with laughter. Buy any album that's actually WORTH your time, like ""Images And Words"" by Dream Theater."
5,Ashlee rocks!,"To all you Ashlee bashers: shut the f*** up! What more do you want? She has proven that she CAN sing and you people still bash her. So she lip synched big flippin deal! My wife is a singer too and has had acid reflux like Ashlee. It can ruin your voice so unless you people think you can do better than her, go ahead! She'll sing you off the stage though! Ashlee has a great talent and does co write her own music unlike her bimbo sister. This album has catchy lyrics and great beats! My wife and I both enjoy this and so does our eleven month old son!Fifty stars for Ashlee!"
1,She deserves to be kicked in the....,"(fill in any word here________.)This is the most disturbing grotesque excuse for music that has graced gods green earth. Its amazing that this girl gets all this recognition for having no talent.Hey GO BUY THE NEW EDGUY, PRIMAL FEAR, OLD MANDS CHILD, OR DESTRUCTION. They can all be purchased on AMAZON."
5,Simply A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!,"This album is simply amazing and Ashlee prevails with her Sophmore album I AM ME! All the tracks on here are simply incredible including my Favs L.O.V.E. , Eyes Wide Open, and I Am Me. This is a must have for any pop fan and of course Ash fan.People who come here to rip her album obviously are internet geeks who sit around trying to piss her real fans off. It doesn't matter, all those people who wrote the bad reviews I am sure are stuck on the SNL mishap over a year ago and haven't actually heard the album. I smell a #1 album, eat it haters!"
1,Wow,Well Ashlee Simpson is a couple of months of years older then I am and very good looking at that. At least she has that
1,One talented Cat!!,"Sounds like she had that acid reflux thingy again (yeah, we believe you Ashlee) and gave the mic to her cat!!! Awful!!"
1,As long as theres kids.....,......over produced slop will continue to be made.even the title is ridiculous.maybe she should be someone else who can sing.god have pity on those who hear her ''live''!!!!!!!
4,No sophomore slump here!,"We all know that you have many haters but I really think this CD is something good. Something special. I find songs like Coming Back For More and L.O.V.E. to be very catchy and songs like Catch Me When I Fall to be very honest and relate able. Many people diss Ashlee because of her voice I believe. I agree that she does NOT have the greatest voice BY FAR but she writes and makes catchy music. And no one seems to commend her on actually writing her own music which a lot of pop stars these days don't even try to do.My favorite song here is Dancing Alone but I also like Catch Me When I Fall, L.O.V.E., Coming Back For More and Say Goodbye.At first I didn't think this could top her first CD but now (even though I like them both) find that this one does take the cake.On a side note I wrote this review on January 14, 2007 so I don't know how it got under this date...I didn't write this almost a year ago...Strange, really.Update: I guess it corresponds to when I purchased the album."
4,Wow!!!!,"I think that Ashlee Simpson is a really good singer. It is just that some of her songs can get a little wierd/boring, or even ongoing of the same verse. But overall, I think that she is great, even better than some singers. I do have to say that I love her song called, ""L.O.V.E"" I hope she makes another cd!!!!:)"
1,Duh... $$ can buy you into the Charts,"it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this girl can't sing. If you take into account her ""resume"", you'd see she is really quite pathetic. Anyone who cannot sing live should not be considered an artist. her stuff sells because it is teenybopper... plain and simple; marketwise, it all gets shoved into the american family that raises little girl princesses. Instead of naming off her good songs, i will list for you the live performances she has managed to screw up. 1.) SNL snafu, her performance is the only one to interrupt the show. 2.) Orange bowl performance where the whole stadium booed her because of her raspy voice 3.) Goodmorning America where all the girl teen princesses cheered for their definition of talent"
1,Not Impressed....,"How this chick ever got a first record contract is beyond me. Ashlee is so bad, that you actually want to cut off your ears to stop them from bleeding. Ashlee may drink, but she will make you want to drink after not even one song on this disk. This will kill your you musical ear if you listen to tis trash!!! You're better off listening to nails on a chock-board. The nails ona chock-board has a better beat, and easier on your ears."
1,Pure Awful Trash,"I love music. I love listening to such alternative bands such as the postal service, cursive, bright eyes, black rebel motorcycle club, and many more. I also listen to dj's from around the globe. What I hate more than anything is a teenage girl who gets to be a singer because of the family reputation. The MTV show, the Ashlee Simpson show was by far one of the worst shows I have seen. After the big mistake of being caught lipsinging, ashlee went low for a while. But then, she decided to ruin music once again with coming out with her sophmore cd. People please, listen to good music and support bands that really are unique. Ashlee Simpson is destroying music as we know it and you need to know that music is not just about where you come from, it's about the way you can express yourself in a unique way. Ashlee, please stop making records, for the love of god. Thanks."
1,placebo syndrome n effect,first we get 98 degrees then her big sis jessica who is wack now we get 2 cd's of ashlee who lip syncs believe me this is crappy pass on this 1.
1,"No thanks,I'd rather listen to Pink floyd instead","I am me is lousy,horrible,vapid,vomit inducing,terrible,repulsive,disgusting,well I could go on.She has one of the worst voices ever and only got big because of her family.Songs like boyfriend and eyes wide open will make you ill.Take my advice and avoid this.Get Meddle from Pink floyd instead."
4,Reviewed by Roise!,I really liked this c.d. But it wasnt as good as her 1st c.d. but it was amazing on its own. I really would recommend buying it.
3,Good and Bad,"How can people review this cd saying it sucked. I thought it was surprisingly candid and good. Oh, and review P!sser the Misser while your at it. He thinks he can talk smack about Ashlee when once you look at who he really is, you'll find out he's a prostitute that is located in Boston! That's just sick. And he was trying to call some other girl a homo? Clearly he is the one that is the homo here. Plus, he probably wanted her for his services anyhow. She may have turned him on. I really have no clue. This album is worth 3 stars ok. I will say it again, 3 stars. That means it is in between a good album and a bad album. I'm not reviewing the SImpson girl, just the album. There."
1,My God This Is Bad,"How on earth can this girl get anyone to put out a vocally bad albumlike this? Maybe the same idiot that would pay her worthless sister also?My goodness,she just can't sing..What is wrong that someone who can't sing better than the local neighborgirl can put out an album??This is really amateurish ..but then anything those two do is amateurish."
2,Ashlee Simpson - I Am Me (2.5 stars),"Time ago a wrote a review for this album, but when i read it again i thought "" how could i wrote this!"" i had said that this CD was amazing! but after listening to it a couple of times i realize that this album was only a collection of eleven mediocre songs. Ashlee's first album ""Autobiography"" was much better than this, it had some beautiful lyrics but ""I Am Me"" only had poor written lyrics only talking about stupid things there are only a couple of great songs on this album, in my opinion they are: ""Say Goodbye"" and ""Catch me when i fall"" the rest of the songs disappointed me. I hope that she does a better job the next time."
1,ugh,"everytime I turn on the tv that boyfriend song is always on and that annoying whiny melody gets stuck in my head. That's why it's called popular music, it's shoved down everyone's throats for the purpose of making everyone miserable hilary ashlee lindsay all look and sound the same: HORRIBLE!!! How can anyone tell them they are artists and musicians when in reality they are exploiting the industry with their non talented fluff"
4,I am ME,"I was very much looking forward to this CD, I did like her last album, She sounds much better on this album. I new side of Simpson comes out ..My Favorite songs are -Boyfriend, LOVE, Catch Me When I Fall, I AM ME and Say Goodbye.Least favorite song on the Album is Burning Up"
1,Triumph of Connections Over Talent,"It is ironic that this album is called ""I am Me"". What is clear from the album is that Ashlee does not know who she is. This is an album where some celebrity's sister did what her producer's told her to do to make money for the corporate machine. So, the ""artist"" changed the color of her hair, threw in a few disco / rap / soulful somgs - something to try and please everyone - and the whole lot is thrown together and called an album. There may be some talented production here, but no trace of a performer, certainly not an artist. The cheap image on the cover is further proof of the marketing idea that drives this drivel pretending to be an album. - If Ashlee wasn't Jessica's sister, believe me, you would not be considering this purchase. Just because crap begets crap, doesn't mean you have to let yourself be suckered in to buying it. It's not the only album on Amazon."
1,REVIEW OF THE COVER,"For a pink bubblegum-infused pop star, who would've thought her cover would be so dark, only half her face is shown. But the worst part of the cover is the bottom few inches, with emphasizes her breasts. SHE'S NOT PAMELA ANDERSON, PEOPLE! Did any female pop artists from 50, 40, 30, even 20 years ago have to emphasize her mammary glands on thier album cover? Only the filthiest ones. Her own lyrics stress that she feels ""hot, hot, hot."" And Ashlee Simpson is in high school, portraying herself in such a sexualized light like a Hooters girl. Yecch. I feel like I need a shower now."
2,Not here to bash Ashlee.,"I'm not on this page to bash Ashlee. I've actually heard the CD - unlike some other people who just want to slate her - and I have to say, it is dissapointing. The first four songs were very cool, but the other seven were a let-down!Better luck next time, Ash!"
3,Ok but not that good,This album is way worse than her previous one (and I like her previous one)This one has like 4 or 5 good songs the rest really suck! I mean Ashlee sure has turned sour since her autobiography days. I think that some of the unreleased songs are better than the songs on the album! Unless you are a huge Ashlee fan (which I doubt) then stay away from this disc.
1,faker than fake,"ashlee's recent face lift and apparent nose job is proof that's she's all plastic and no talent. she must of asked the Dr to make her look like her sister. very sad cause she's unrecognizable now. better looking, maybe, still can't sing or dance."
1,we don't deserve this kind of punishment,Ashlee Simpson is the worst 'artist' in the history of music.
1,i really hate joe simpson,"i really hate joe simpson, for always trying to shove his ""talented"" daughters down our throats. ashlee simpson lips sync, and she made up several different lies explaining why, now she has come back to make another crappy album? joe simpson has got to stop being so obsessed with fame.do not buy this album. i have heard it and there is not one song that is memorable enough to be remembered. as soon as you finish listening, you just regret wasting your past hour listening to this crap."
1,Proof of 'The Dumbing Down Of America!',"Ashlee Simpson makes Milli Vanilli look like venerated Grammy deserving world class artists! She is living proof that empty, formulaic overly commercial tripe that passes for music is being released by record companies that market this junk to malleable, brainwashed kids who don't know the difference between good music and the garbage that is Ashlee Simpson, Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, etc. The sad thing is that Ashlee will ride this mediocrity train until her popularity wanes due to some other corporate whored teen schlock star comes out! How sad indeed."
2,mmm k,"i've only listened to samples of the songs so i can't really give it a valid review. other than ""boyfriend"" which i've listened to completely, seems like most of the songs are okay, ""l.o.v.e."" honestly from just a sample sounds ANNOYING. but then who knows, maybe i'll like the album once i listen to the whole thing. i really liked autobiography, it became a guilty pleasure cd, and you gotta admit all the songs on there were just ""nicely done"" (in the best meaning possible). funny thing though, seems like everyone who's bashing this album is saying ""it's worse than the first, why make a 2nd?""... SO THEN, if they didn't like the first, why bother giving this one a listen? so to all the haters, just put a lid on it n let the girl do her thing. surely she has some talent since she's the one with the singing career n not you -=p"
1,No need for a review...,...just to give it 1 star to lower the 3 star average. I don't need to explain why this piece of $hit sucks. This is not music.
2,"Good talent, horrible album","These songs are extremely boring and the melodies don't seem to catch on.The best songs are Boyfriend and the last slow song, Say Goodbye, which is great. It sounds like something from the 80's, the music is great and the lyrics are nice and simple."
4,Why do people hate Ashlee Simpson???,"OK, I Am Me is not as good as Autobiography, but it has the dark side of the diva. I know that some songs of the album suck like ""Dancin alone"" and ""Burnin up"" and I think thje bonus tracks are better than these songs like ""Get Nasty"" and ""Kicking and Screamin"" but leave her alone. It just that I can't understand why people hate her??? It's new in the music industry you can't expect that she can be a super star as Madonna, but think that I Am Me is just her new album, and if U love her U like it so much!!!"
4,.Put This Under Your Skin.,"I have to say I did not know what to expect when I heard Ash was releasing her second follow-up album to Autobiography. However, when I got 'I Am Me,' I have to say I was impressed. It was interesting to see a bit of a new direction in Ashlee's music. All of the songs are really greatly put together and whether or you like her, I feel she has done well. I just adored the album.-Another fact of the matter, I think it is immoral of such hatred of people to direct aspects of saying Ashlee is ""ugly"", ""stupid,"" ""fake,"" and a ""b!+ch."" It just demostrates how low all of you individuals can go and how superior you must really think you are. We are all different, Ashlee is too. Get over yourselves!And yes, please go ahead and vote that this review was not helpful...because I hope it wasn't. Ashlee's sophomore rocks, and if you disagree, you can just shove the album up your jealous a$$-A 16 yr old A. Simpson Fan-"
2,Honest,"I will be honest. I have not heard this record. I sure as sh*t did not buy it! But, it gets two stars because I have heard a few songs, and her voice is more close to her smokers hack of a voice than the last album. I guess that means papa Joe is letting those on the soundboard let her sound a little less manufactured. But here is my problem. Her fake boobs look great on the cover! But poor Ashlee suffers from butter-face = everthing about her body is good but her face. Butterface."
2,It's ok,"It's not good, but it's not terribly awful. Not worth buying, but maybe used. Really the main reason I wrote this at all was about pisser the misser or whatever. I mean yeah Ashlee lip-synched, but Madonna? Watch your mouth, fool."
1,i can't believe someone called this real PUNK! it's not real MUSIC,"i pray none of you are over 15. if you are, you need to get your head checked for worms. the worst group of the 00's. abysmal. oh. btw.. you better look that work up kiddies"
1,How incredibly sad.,"H. L. Mencken once remarked that ""nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public."" Trash like this sad excuse for ""music"" makes me worry for the future of this country. Ashlee Simpson is a talentless plastic doll being eaten up by teenyboppers everywhere like the ones in these reviews who claim to ""know good music"" because they've never been exposed to anything real. She poses a bigger threat to America than any politician.Folks, Ashlee Simpson is not ""rock"". She is not ""punk"". She is not anything but the fluff pop equivalent of empty calories, and she cannot sing. I can't put it any more plainly. Please, please, don't purchase this album for your kids. We must stop supporting this stupid little girl or she will never go away."
3,"Personally, much better than 'Autobiography'","Ashlee Simpson has never made an impression on me. During the 'Autobiography' era, I had much dislike for her music. I also believed that her voice was absolutely horrendous. When 'I Am Me' was released, I gave it a chance and it was semi-worth it. Her voice fits her style of music, but still is not impressive. However, 'I Am Me' shines a different light on Simpson.1) Boyfriend - Edgy, but boring. 6/10.2) In Another Life- Decent. 6/10.3) Beautifully Broken- Mellow and sweet. 8/10.4) L.O.V.E.- Fun, yet boring. 7/10.5) Coming Back For More- Good. 7/10.6) Dancing Alone- Just okay. 6/10.7) Burning Up- Lifeless and not her style. 4/10.8) Catch Me When I Fall. Cool and flowing. 7/10.9) I Am Me- Grungy and cool. 7/10.10) Eyes Wide Open- Grungy and edgy. 8/10.11) Say Goodbye. Just okay again. 7/10.73/110- 66%: ** 1/2 - ***"
1,"Dear Lord, what's the world coming to?","I can't believe talentless people like Ashlee Simpson are allowed to put CD's out! She can't sing at all; she LIP-SYNCHS! And she sounds like a dying cat or like she has a cold. Enough said, she's fake!I actually feel sorry for the kids and teens out there who like stuff like this and other talentless hacks such as Hilary Duff, Lindsay Lohan, and Britney Spears. They need to realize what real music is.Do our society a favor and do not even think about buying this album!Artists and bands I do recommend: No Doubt, 3 Doors Down, Fall Out Boy, Daze Off (http://www.dazeoffrocks.com), Hawthorne Heights, Blink 182, Staind, Bowling for Soup, Jimmy Eat WorldThe artists I mentioned sound A LOT BETTER than Ashlee Simpson."
1,are you insane!!!,She is monotone! She doesn't even sing she just talks in rythmic monotone. Get a grip girl this cd isn't half as good as your others which is half as good as a crappy cd. get over it you can't sing! so tired of this crap.
1,I am me?,"I've has the album for about a year now, and I've waited a long time until I wrote this review. I'm usually not the one to complain, but this album makes no sense at all. First, it's her voice. On the CD, it sounds really raw and smokey, but when seeing her singing life, her voice is way more girly and different. (She was caught lip-synching in 2005.) Then, it's the lyrics. Ashlee, if you aren't okay with how you look and want to have plastic surgery, that's okay with me. But then don't keep telling your fans ""stay as you are"" and stuff like that. Your CD is titled ""I am me"", and you do sing things like ""I won't change for anyone"". I am very disappointed with your CD."
2,Ashlee Simpson - I Am Me,"Huh? Why does people nowadays get so easy to become a singer? His father and sister is in the music industry, that doesn't mean she has to follow them. I Am Me? You won't change for anyone? Then why did you change your hairstyle totally and doing pop music when you said you only wanted to make rock music in the first place? This album is not bad, but when you realised that there are lots of touch ups being made in this album..or hear her sing live, you'll doubt her ability to sing immediately. However, you may like songs like Boyfriend, L.O.V.E and I Am Me. They are the only songs that worth listening. Forget about the touch ups, just enjoy the 'Music'. Haha! For that 3 catchy songs..i gave it 2 stars instead of 1."
1,Down With Ashley,"This person is not a singer. I have been forced to listen pathetic excuse for music and can honelstly say PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT HER. It just sounds like a ton of screaming and yelling and annoyances. Ugh, please do not support this noise."
2,Not the Best,"Boyfriend was okay, with catchy guitar riffs but the rest of the album went downfall. LOVE is just a rendition of Hollaback Girl, Dancing Alone sounds the same after Love Makes the World go Round and Say Goodbye seems to sound like Lindsay Lohan's Over.When singing I Am Me, the verses are: I am me, and I won't change for anyone!It should be I am not Me! and I will change for someone for the sake of money.Ms. Simpson. tick tick tick.... your 15 minutes are up"
2,Omg,"Luckily I have Itunes so, I can pick the songs that I want to buy. I feel sorry for those who've bought the whole CD. I mean there songs (2) that are good ( Catch Me When I fall, Boyfriend...) But other then that Just another CD that is going to be in the USED CD bin sooner or later. Her First CD had more songs that I liked than this one ( by like 2 more) Both CDS are filled with Fillers. I guess nothing goes on in her little life. No wonder Jessice is the star in the family with Ashlee voice she should be the shadow. Hahaha I was listening to the radio and there like the TOP 10 butterheads ( everything looks good but her head) and she was #3 whoa! Jessice has talent,looks, and probaly brains. Ashlee what are you left with? Humiliation, Big Nose, and a horrible voice. I'm being nice giving her 2 stars because thats how many songs I bought from this album."
1,Total crap,I am me surely is the worst album of this year.This lousy babe just cant sing.I really wonder whether the person who gave her a record deal was drunk at the that time.Each and every song is a huge disaster.A MUST AVOID IN MY OPINION.Get something nice like PARANOID from BLACK SABBATH instead.
1,The Honkers,"I heard the last Jessica, wait, I mean Ashlee Simpson singing on Saturday Night Live. Well, actually she was not singing, but that is another story. Anyway, this is a completely different girl with no talent. The girl on SNL had a big old nose. This particular Ashlee Simpson looks like every other 18 year old girl I see: bleached blonde hair and fake tan. This Cd is an improvement over the other Ashlee Simpson cd in that I have never actually had to hear one of the songs yet. Kudos!"
1,Pathetic,"Do you know how pathetic it is that this CD debuted at #1? She was exposed as a fake on SNL, got booed at the Orange Bowl, and obviously got a record deal from her sister being a music star. (An equally crappy one.) People say, ""Just listen to the MUSIC!"" Okay I'll give it a try. All I heard were songs about not putting words ""up in"" my mouth and about my girls standing in a circle. Her voice sounds like nails on a chalk board especially when she tries to do ballads. Please, AVOID this CD at all costs. Unless you like lip synching, untalented, fake, headache inducing music, then go ahead and buy!! I'm sure you could find twenty copies at a used record store for about a dollar."
1,Thank You 2005,"This isn't really all about Ashlee, but pop in general. I'm writing this to 2005. A thank you note. Why? Because, it seems our dreams have come true. Britney Spears is over, J. Lo is married slut, Jessica Simpson will not make anymore albums, Backstreet Boys's CD was a one hit wonder, Ricky Martin failed, and my personal favorite, Ashlee Simpson's 2nd attempt failed. Also, you've brought back Madonna, Alanis Morisette, Natasha Bedingfield, Toni Braxton, along with many other real singers and divas. But to top it all off A BEYONCE COMEBACK!!!!! but she's solo again :( AN RAP ISN'T THAT BIG ANYMORE. So, 2005, thank you.- HilaryDuffSucks"
1,TERRIBLE!,"ashlee simpson is not a good singer. her vocals are horrible and off! her songs have an okay beat, and the band is good, but she is just terrible. someone take her away!"
1,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,"What in the world has music come to these days, the record companies just never learn. As if a lip-syncing debacle on SNL wasn't enough, Ashlee then went on to actually attempt live singing at the Orange bowl half time show earlier this year in a performance so horrid, 70,000 football fans proceded to boo her out of the stadium. As for the record itself, does it even matter? its little more than standard pop fare, often below standards with Ashlees obviously deteriorating vocal chords, but hey it doesn't matter. I'm sure this album will go on to triple platinum and beyond just like her last release, just thought i'd throw my two cents in. Bottom line: Save your money and go buy a Pearl Jam record, your ears and brain will thank you"
2,This is almost all crap...,"Ashlee Simpson...ahh...so much to say. Sure, half the world+ hates her because of SNL, and sure she isn't the most talented. But her debut, Autobiography, was pretty good. This is just crap. The only two songs holding it together are ""Boyfriend"" and ""In Another Life"", the first two songs. The lows are ""L.O.V.E."" in which she talks and screeches her way through and ""Burning Up"" in which she moans the chorus ""ah ah ah ah burning ah ah ah ah for you"" over and over. You would have thought she'd realize this could be her last chance."
3,Not as good as the first,"This album definitly doesn't have the same power as Ashlee's freshman album ""Autobiography"", there were fewer songs that I like on this album, where as, with Autobiography I liked every song but one. But otherwise, its ok. I hate that people are still caught up in the whole SNL thing and don't realize that even the most famous singers around, Micheal Jackson, Bono, etc, have all lip-synced at least once. Not that Ashlee can compare, but did everyone really think that she was singing live all those other times? Based on her MTV show and many performances where she was obviously singing live, I respect her and haven't based my opinion of her on that one stupid mishap.So, to get to the point, her sophmore album is pretty good, but not excellent. My favorite song on the album is track 6 ""Dancing Alone"". I also love ""L.O.V.E"" for its empowering, fun, feel good lyrics."
4,You really need to give this girl a chance....,"You all need to move on away from the whole SNL thing, she has and so have her fans. She is a young, growing artist and she is getting better as time goes on. I was a fan of her first album, but I like this one much more. I think people need to stop yelling at Ashlee Simpson fans all the time. I get so much grief for liking her music. It drives me crazy! I like what I like and I don't care what other people think. I am not ashamed to admit I'm an Ashlee Simpson fan!"
5,get over it,"ok im sick of everyone dissing ashlee simpson because she made one little mistake last year on Snl...so what??? Everyone makes mistakes...we're not all perfect!! grow up and get over it!! and besides, that has nothing to do with the way this album sounds....which is great in my opinion..her voice has improved a lot and u can tell she worked hard on this...so give her credit."
1,Why oh why doesn't Amazon allow a zero rating???,"Ok, here's my plan; Get my pet mongrel, bleach her tresses and set her howling and growling to my karaoke machine. I'll make millions. At least, my b**** can sing, and has bigger jugs than Ashlee!!"
2,Even I'm not dumb enough to buy this!,"Yeah, I like grrl rock. But this is all manufactured out of thin air. There's not much grrrl, and there's no rock at all!"
3,People Need To Chill Out,"The first thing I would like to say is that if you don't like Ashlee Simpson, or her style of music, then DON""T LISTEN TO IT! Everyone has the option of what they do and don't listen to. I think it's crap that a lot of people trash this album based on her SNL performance. Most artists do lip sync on occasion. I'm not saying that Ashlee Simpson is the best artist in the world. I'm just saying that you can like a song and not like the artist who sings it as a person."
1,"Very, very bad","This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard. And I've heard some crap. The cover pretty much sums up Ashlee's two best assets. The singing is painful to listen to. I had to clean the blood out of my ears.On a happy note, check out Divide & Kreate's mash of L.O.V.E. and Van Halen. It rocks. If only they would have put it on this flame thrower of pain they call an album."
5,hey !,"i am so ashamed to admitt this. I actually like ashlees i am me album. its not popish as her first cd. it's kinda dark and edgy kinda like her album cover. my favorite songs are boyfriend, dancing alone, coming back for more, and catch me when i fall."
2,I L.O.V.E. this album.. NOT,"Sorry Ashlee. I will credit you for one thing, and one thing only, the ability to make a good music video, it has helped you get this far. However, you ride off your sister's success, and your music is below par, it just isn't enough to carry you through, you need to face the facts that your talent isn't in singing and just because a relative is famous(even if they shouldn't be) that doesn't mean you have to be. I guess i'm just rambling but this CD is a waste of disc space."
4,I don't think it is so bad,"After reading everyone elses reviews I have to say I didn't think the album was that bad. Sure, maybe she lacks a little in the vocal department,I mean she is no Avril ( who happens to be my fave) but its different. I like it beacuse it can't be defined. It's not pop, it's not punk or rock, it's a combination and personally I like it. I am also a person who focuses more on lyrics than vocal and I think the kyrics to all of ashlee's songs, whether 1st or 2nd album are great. I would much rather have people like Ashlee making music than her sister Jessica."
1,she is the roseanne barr of pop,"i have to admire her teeny bopper fanbase with all of their ''best record ....EVAH!!!!!!!'' and ''she,likes,totally ROCKS!!!!!'' nonsense.thats what kids do.kids also are known for swallowing foreign objects,getting sent to detention,plastering posters of everyone they see on tv in their bedrooms,abbreviating ''the'',standing outside of the TRL building yelling their heads off,you know...really dumb stuff.now i think the kids have made ashley their mission.her and the kids deserve eachother,only kids can relate to such horrible sounding nonsense.''i am me''..........members of MENSA must be scratching their heads over such a brilliant title."
1,If You Buy This CD I Would Reccomend Getting A Therapist With Impeccable Credentials,"While on the couch you need to really think about your life. How often you go out, what your expectations are for yourself and how things got so poor that you actually bought this piece of garbage from this talentless piece of mediocrity. I just saw her perform L.O.V.E. on David Letterman. Her ""singing"" over backing tracks and trying to look sassy shaking her growing hips courtesy McDonalds was pathetic. Speaking of McDonalds I wish I was at the one in Toronto where she tried to get a customer to kiss her feet for a picture so that I could have spat on her in a gesture of unity between the United States and Canada. An act of atonement apologizing for our nation creating this garbage and then inflicting it on our neighbor to the north. I'm sure they'd rather have bird flu infected chickens in every major city than have Ashlee continue to tour up there."
1,Ashlee?,"Ashlee? I was so proud of your last album... Where are you truly in this one? I bought it because, yes, I am a fan. Yet, honestly, it is not going to be a second success that Britney had for sure.. You are not going to be able to ""Oops.."" us! Well anyways, I love Ashlee, but I am disappointed with this album."
1,AMAZING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY,"She is seriously Milli Vanilli of 2004-05. Hahaha! You guys actually listen to this dreck?!?!?! You actually pay good money to listen to a girl using computer technology to ""sing""? BULLSH**! This Cd is basically a girl letting a computer do all the singing for her and claiming to have ""sung"" the whole album. And if you somehow want an explainaiton for my review name, it's explained in the review. I rest my case.(...)"
1,suck on suck,"This is a terrible cd. None of the lyrics make any sense, yet are somehow catchy as hell. Her slurred words and incessant scooping of notes is just plain disgusting. The instruments are the only remotely interesting thing going on in any of the songs. I would be happy if she stopped yelling random things in the background of her songs (e.g. L.O.V.E.) and just went away for a little while**a little while = the rest of eternity"
1,sorry fans but it's horrible,"this CD is a horrible attempt at trying desperately to sing and songwrite cause ashlee so doesn't have talent. She may be doing interviews saying that music and writing means a lot to her but really how much of it does she do? Other people write her stuff and she just changes a word or two around and has to struggle to sing a melody, but that doesn't matter as long as she's getting paid and making income for the family right? No thanks to yuppies"
4,Wonderful Presentation of Jungian Thought,This book is a primer for much of Jung's belief's. The forward for each section is clear and the author has chosen the best of Jung's writing on each subject. I have nearly 200 notes in it!
5,Lyrics are simple and yet meaningful. I loved it.,"I loved it. Songs are real and down to earth. I see myself in most of them(specially""Te conozco""). The lyrics are real and sound about a person that has really lived them."
3,Le falto mucho,"La frescura de su primer disco se perdio en este pero gano en calidad y producion. Con letras mas maduras y definiendo su estilo Arjona hace ver que no esta para la talla que le pusieron en el primer disco, algunas canciones son un plagio descarado y cualquiera con cultura musical se da cuenta que de original tiene muy poco y le falta mucho en sensibilidad poetica. Dice dos o tres verdades con un piano de fondo tratando de aparecer atormentado y muchos se derriten por él, pero no dejan de ser frease hechas (a otro nivel eso si, pero igual de prefabricadas). Arjona se tomo muy enserio su primer disco y trato de volverlo a hacer con mas produción y le laslio el trabajo de un novato que ya no es novato pero con mas reflectores."
5,A classic... highly recommended!,"Dr. Yahnke's book is very accessible, love her writing style. Illustrations and sidebar material make this book a fun and engaging read. This is a great place to start if you suspect your kid might be gifted - or if you are looking for some advice on how to live with and advocate for an already identified gifted child. A classic... highly recommended!"
2,Not as comprehensive as I'd hoped....,"While naming so many famous social outcasts and school failures who were phenomenally advanced, this book goes on to tell about the social affability and drive 'GT's have. My experience with such children has been about 50/50, half socially fine and willing and able to get on with studying, the other half way over in the other end of this spectrum. This book makes far too little mention of the second half, which I found most disappointing, as it is the second group which perhaps needs more understanding and encouragement."
3,Book's title is misleading,This book deals quite extensively with how to help your child if the school he/she goes to offers no gifted program or a pull-out program.I didn't really find that any of the issues I deal with in my school district (which has gifted classes) or with my son (who seems to have some attention issues specifically related to his giftedness) were answered.It does list other resources... Maybe those will be helpful.
1,Another deception from Guild,"Don't buy this. It is not the performance it purports to be.This performance was once available on Walhall. Guild hasmade cuts to fit it on two CDs -- the Il mio tesoro lacksthe middle section with the famous phrase. Someone shouldtake legal action against this label -- caveat emptor --even with a readily available source as in this case, theystill bowdlerize the material."
3,Humanities CLEP study guide,"While this is a decent supplement, there is no way I could have passed the test using only this book. The Humanities test required numerous different resources."
1,Not one question was on the test,"I expected to see at least one reviewed question on the test, but did not see any. I passed with a 52, but it was not because of this book. Other study guides helped somewhat. I'm just glad that it's over!!"
4,Good foundation,"I passed the exam with a good grade thanks, in large part, to using this book. In addition to this book, I did some further study on opera and literature. For the CLEP I took, this book did cover about 90% of the questions listed."
4,"Great review book however, support it with other material","I just took my first CLEP test this morning. I had NO prior exposure to the subjects covered in the Humanities CLEP. I used this study guide and supplimented it with ""Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia of The Arts"". I also used the 4th Edition ""Cracking the CLEP"". There was very little material on the test that I didn't recognize. I did MUCH better than I thought I would have since, before now, I didn't know Dante from Adam. This was a huge confidence builder for me."
4,Very Helpful,"Not much to add that any of the other reviewers haven't already said, just another recommendation.I found this book extremely helpful, especially the general outline section that does a quick summary of the history of literature, art, music, and architecture. Because of the broad nature of the humanities test, you will have to find some additional material. If you plan on taking more than one of the general exams, I highly recommend REA's General CLEP exam study guide(which includes a CD-ROM), and CLEP Success 2004. Art history books with pictures are helpful, but may not be necessary since many of the questions are based off of well known works, but DK publishing had some good general books that fit the bill nicely."
3,Good starting point...,"This book is good for those who have little background knowledge of humanities and need a starting point. I gave this book only three stars because I feel it doesn't actually teach information one needs to know for the CLEP, but focuses more on test taking skills. Even though some material covered in the book did appear on the CLEP test, I recommed using multiple references i.e. textbooks & other study guides. I passed the CLEP with a 67, but most information I found in the book did not help me too much when taking the test."
4,Not what you'd expect,It's midday and there's something on cable called She Creature. Sounds terrible but I flip it on. Despite the lame title the movie is actually quite good! I can never sit still long enough to watch anything on tv but I didn't get up once during this movie. It still borders on cheesy but still worth watching. I'd actually like to see it again!
3,THIS GIRL'S GOT GILLS,"Another entry in the Stan Winston CREATURE FEATURES, remakes of older horror films. This is not a faithful remake of the sixties' version, but an updated one, in which a lovely mermaid is captured by an old gent who finds himself falling under her malevolent spell. She is kidnapped by a carnival showman played with great relish by Rufus Sewell; he whisks her off to America and while on board their vessel, she wreaks havoc.Carla Gugino co-stars as Sewell's lover, and she finds herself mesmerized by the lovely but lethal mermaid.It tends to get a little confusing at times but there is a commendable eeriness to it, but the ending is a little veiled."
4,Good Movie,I had been looking for this movie for some time and found it on amazon at a really low price. It now is in my collection and I am sure to be watching it many times over.
4,GOOD ENJOYMENT,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT A RECENT MOVIE BUT IT WAS STILL ENJOYABLE, I LIKED THE STORY LINE."
2,CREATURE FEATURES bites again!!,"Yet another CREATURE FEATURE presentation, SHE-CREATURE is a remake of a 1957 sci-fi flick.The plot centers around a conman (Rufus Sewell) running a bogus circus sideshow featuring his wife (Carla Gugino) playing a mermaid. But one day Sewell stumbles across a REAL mermaid (Rya Kihlstedt) who has enormous sex appeal, as well as a lust for human blood. Predictably, Sewell seizes this once in a lifetime opportunity and steals the mermaid and places it in a tank aboard a ship bound for America, but soon it becomes apparent that the creature is messing with Gugino's head, and the ships crew learn about the mermaid's diet preferences the hard way.SHE CREATURE has good performances by Sewell and Gugino, but the movie is a bit too talky for its own good and there's no real suspense to speak of, but there are a couple of gory scenes and a VERY low key sex scene in which sexy Gugino is briefly possessed by the She-Creature's savage libido."
3,A KILLER MERMAID!!,"This is not exactly my cup of tea since I am a fan of mermaid movies!! I am most particularly fond of SPLASH, NIGHT TIDE and Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid. This mermaid movie is graphic and it's mermaid is evil...although very mysterious and beautiful!It's not an awful movie, but definetely not my favorite mermaid movie!!"
2,She Creature goes down with the ship,"I hate to say it people that liked this movie that I really didnt. I saw this on digital cable and by my surprise it was boring. It just didnt seem right to me. IT just seemed like another one of those cheesy horror flicks (though it aint) it had some elements to it but all in all I was completely bored. Mermaids are cool, especially this one because she was hot and it was the only reason I watched it, but I watched the Peter Pan movie that came out in December of 2003 and it was a better acting version that Robin William's one. The mermaids in that movie were evil (because it is in the original book). This mermaid is evil too, but more sexy. It's not the worst and it certainly isnt the best. Carla Gugino(tv's Spin City, Snake Eyes), Rufus Sewell(Dark City, A Knight's Tale) Jim Piddock(Best In Show, Tv's Angel) and Gil Bellows(Tv's Ally McBeal, Judas Kiss) star."
3,Ending didn't make sense,The end was weird. The mermaid turned into some huge grewsome beast. It didn't make sense.
4,brilliant and sexy movie!!!,"The best part of this movie for me was the subtle sapphic sexuality between the mermaid and Carla Cugio's character. There was a lot of curiousity and teasing from the mermaid. It's really a treat. I recommend this movie especially to the ""womyn"" out there. Check it out."
4,"sexy, sizzling horror flick","A topless, evil sexy mermaid, and a hot leading actress... what more can you ask for? Oh yeah, the plot was good too."
4,I agree-pretty good movie...,"First of all Carla Gugino(not pictured) is about the prettiest gal in movies or t.v. She was in ""The one,"" with the incredible Jet Li, and ""Spy kids,"" with Antonio Banderas. Too bad her t.v. show-'Karen Sisco' was cancelled. I was skeptical about She Creature and bought it anyway. I'm glad I did, it turned out being very good. It reminded me a bit of the Saturday movie matinees I used to see as a kid....the creature from the black lagoon, and Godzilla etc. It's a newer and much better film by comparison, and I hope this kind of lower budget film making gets it's due recognition."
4,I came I saw I liked,"I will say this , it`s nice to see a horror ficlk that freatures a mermaid . Let`s face it ,in mythology (anywhere you go )mermaids are evil . She Creature gives you that to the upmost . Like a lot of people I thought this was going to be a chessey mess . I am happy to say that I was wrong . I was without a doubt impressed by the acting , story , and special effects this ovie had . This moving will keep your interest till the end of it . The mermaid is both enchanting and dangeroursly errie just by looking at her . Chills start down your arms as you gaze into those eyes . In others knowing something you don`t . Forget about it being low budget , just see it with an open mind ."
5,AWSOME BOOK,"I read this book 4 times and every time was the same, I thought the book was great. I have 2 dogs myself."
4,Don't you hate books where the dog dies?,"Imagine a world where all dogs must be killed because of a BSE-like prion disease. Imagine a boy who is an outsider, and his adopted wild dog, both on the run, both endangered. The premise is great, the action is believable but the ending was rather dribbly, without resounding triumph."
5,through my eyes,"This book was so good if i hadn't already read this book I wouldread it again. I would suggest this book to everybody. Yeah the book is a little slow but i think its completely worth it. Logan is a young boy who is couhgt in adolesents and frustration justpreesureing on his nerves. His stepfather is not a good thing tword the problem with Logan. Jack is a wild dog who is very easly adapted to logan and it was like God sent them both for each other. Logan and Jack are lead in a whirl wind journey to find that thier friendship between a dog and a boy is greater than anything in the world. I rate this book a 5 but if I could i would rate it a 1000,000,0000,000,000,000,000 you get the point."
4,Liked it a lot,"I am writing this review on my Mom's ID.I liked how this 14 year-old boy is trying to save his dog. The boy's name is Logan Moore and the dog's name is Jack and they are trying to find a safe place but there isn't anywhere to hide. Logan's father is a laboratory worker and is trying to find what's going on with all the dogs in the town. Then they find a mysterious disease killing all the dogs in the city and call it Psychotic Outburst Syndrome or POS. They are sending agents out to shoot the ill dogs. What I don't like about the book is the killing, gore, and the boot camp story. It's a very emotional and exicting book.I recommend it for kids 12 and older. It is a good book and I hope you will read it too."
1,Logitech Cordless Optical Mouse,"Unfortunately, the Logitech mouse that I received was defective and had to be returned."
4,"A good, quick read","I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the characters, and their relationships. This was a bit deeper than I expected in the end.Glad I picked it up! Now I can't wait to see the movie. (I'd like to compare the 2)"
4,Good read,this is the first I have read by Mark Spragg and I totally enjoyed this book and will look forward to reading more by Mark Spragg
2,Cliche city,"This is what passes for great literature today. So-called beautiful writing with a cliched story and empty characters. The men in the story seem flesh and bone, but their lives and relationships are less than believable. The young widow in the story is totally unsympathetic and I couldn't understand how she ended up in the life she has. Her daughter, age 9 supposedly, seemed more like 11 or 12. The whole plot was trumped up. The writing is conventional at best. Read Plainsong by this author's mentor, Kent Haruf, instead."
3,I liked it,"Wish I hadn't seen the (weak) movie first-the only one not mis-cast was Morgan Freeman.I liked this book. It was a book I wanted to get back to. However, I think Jean's character didn't seem true to me somehow. I don't think he writes women as well as men. I loved the male characters and their friendship.Would recommend this and his other novels. If you like these, you like Kent Haruf and most of all Cormac McCarthy."
4,"Lovely language, conventional story","I read this tear-jerker last night. It's a sentimental-but-not-sloppily-so down-on-her-luck-single-mom story with requisite cute kid returning to the in-law who hates her because ... well, read the book. Beautifully set in Wyoming on a ranch that has seen better days. I quite liked it although it is a conventional story with high PC overtones. The writing and language lift the story to a higher state of grace."
4,I didn't want my relationship with the characters to end,"I loved this story, Mark developed the characters so well I wish the novel could have been longer. He is so genius at describing the scene, it's almost as if the reader is sitting in Nina's cafe or sitting in Mitch's cabin. Of course, I pictured the characters as they have been cast in the film. Couldn't have chosen better actors than Redford and Freeman. This was a story that I wish could have gone on, I was disappointed when it ended. Grif was so tough, she won my heart, but Mitch was my favorite."
2,This story is sooooo played out.,"I'm reading this for our local book club and wondering who the heck thought that this would be a good read. Although the author writes well enough that you can visualize the scene with ease, there are some places where the plot appears to fall down. For example, when we are introduced to Einor one gets a feeling of cold winter approaching. Some chapters later, we find Jean mixing margaritas for a ""cry in your drink session"" with Nina in the backyard with feet cooling in a wading pool. Other characters such as Starla are downright strange. There is no real charactor development. Noone I could fall in love with. Unfortunately this story line was been played out over and over and this book does not offer any fresh prespective on the ""woman done wrong"" theme. But then again if you have a hankering for this type of story, it is an easy read."
3,Competent but uninspiring,"I bought ""An Unfinished Life"" because I saw it compared to Kent Haruf's ""Plainsong,"" which I greatly enjoyed for its lean prose, authentic dialogue, indelible characters, and quietly moving narrative. Unfortunately, though, I was very disappointed with Spragg's voice and narrative command. To be honest, I don't really see any parallels between the two novels except for the fact that both take place in the rural west. Spragg's style is much wordier, for example. His characters are rather predictable, as is the basic plot of the novel. There's nothing exactly wrong with the novel, I guess, but it's competent in a dull, uninspiring way. After a while I found myself skimming whole scenes because I already knew what would happen and how the characters would respond. Spragg needs to take more risks if he wants his novels to mean anything to readers."
2,Book is complete,"Well generally speaking book is complete, but theres marking on all three sides. Ipersonally didnt care for the book."
1,A Waste of Time,"I felt that this book was a waste of time, and the author, distracted by something, threw together huge elements (parents killed, World War II, Ovid Lamartine Killed, uncle chasing girlfriend) but never bothered to make a coherent story, nor to make it interesting."
2,Is everyone in this book crazy?,The Museum Guard had an unpredictable ending only because nothing any of its characters did was motivated even remotely by a logical reason. I agree with those who describe it as quirky but unsatisfying.
3,"Quirky and only a bit satisfying, unfortunately","Howard Norman is a superb stylist, writing in a way to pull the reader into the characters, however peculiar they are. The characters in this book are nothing if not peculiar. The plot was peculiar too. I have not read anything else by Norman. Perhaps I will give one of his other volumes a try ... with a less depressing/weird plot, I might enjoy his work more."
4,"Intriguing Idea, the Ending was Strained","I had never heard of Norman, but picked up the book at the airport in Houston between connecting flights. I was drawn to the title. The plot was intriguing and unusual. I've been to many museums but pay little mind to the guards there and it came as a surprise to me that they actually might be influenced by the works of art they guard all day. My attention was held throughout but ultimately the end was strained. It was inconceivable to me that the musuem curator and the art professor could not see that assisting Imogene in working out her delusional behavior in soon to by invaded Amsterdam would lead to her death because of her obsession with her Jewish roots. But Norman was interesting enough that I look forward to reading his other books."
5,must-read for understanding WWII period,"When I started this book I thought it might be just a character study of a group of definitely strange people in a small town. When I finished, I had gained further insight into how various people reacted to the European side of the war and the Holocaust, and was reminded of people who risked their lives escaping from Auschwitz to bring the western world evidence of what the Nazis were really up to, only not to be believed. Nobody wanted to hear it. The plot starts out almost dull, then suddenly builds to an action-packed climax with an amazing ending. This is another one I'll be recommeding to my book group. There is plenty here for discussion and a fabulous read."
4,melba rounds,My wife's favorite cracker! Very crunchy. Best with Merks cheese spread. Plain is the best but garlic will do.
3,Good player. Works for region 4. Not perfect picture.,"Good DVD player. Bought this so I could watch my favorite DVD's - McLeod Daughter's. Works fine. The picture for the region 4 DVD's is not as clear as they could be. US DVD's play fine and are clearer. Overall, picture is not as clear as it could be but good enough to enjoy hours of good DVD watching."
3,have you checked prices lately?,"For all the interesting information you find in End of Oil, those reviewers who mention Robert's lack of economics knowledge are correct. The price of oil has recently climbed to $40/barrel just as experts were predicting it to fall to under $10 just 5 years ago. We don't know where the price of oil will be in 20 years, but it is surely not going to ""run out."" As the price goes up, consumers (even the Chinese) will have to readjust including using less and using other technologies which become feasible if the price of oil rises higher. Roberts just doesn't get this. There is good information here, but ignore the theme described by the title. No, there is no ""End of Oil"""
2,The U.S. just expanded reserves 50%,"The book deserves 2 stars because there are worse books on oil out there. But the author fails to grasp many critical issues in both oil economics and developing technology that the book ultimately serves as a another in a long string of ""we are probably doomed books"" to come out now faster than ever. Roberts is a good writer who is just too far out of his depth to write on this topic.Yergin gets stuff wrong as well, but one gets a much better picture with his 1993 oil book even if now over a decade old."
2,Surprise - Price of gas has Decreased!,"No one, unless i missed it, has pointed out that onan ""inflation adjusted"" basis, the price of gasolinehas DECREASED over the past twenty three years. The inflation adjusted price for a gallon of ""regular unleaded"" gas today compared to 1981 would be $ 3.80 (05/08). At an assumed average of regular unleaded gas today (07/08) of $ 4.30 (+-) a gallon that is the result of worldwide economic growth, speculation and environmental restrictions on production, the difference is relatively small. What is also not mentioned is the worldwide successful search for additional reserves -but, again there are roadblocks to development. Of course, oil will eventually run out but it will likely be a long time before ""massive"" new energy sources are found/invented/allowed/developed (nuclear, hydrogen, wind, solar) - all have their own set of problems. The mind of Man will overcome the long-term energy problem but perhaps some are overly hyping it for their own purposes."
3,Decent writer but there are better books,"This book spends a great deal of energy looking at the overall circumstances of world oil. The text is stretched with repetitive writing. To my mind Richard Heinberg's ""The Party's Over"" is far more clear and to the point. Fossil fuel is rapidly depleting. Heinberg hits this hard and in detail, Roberts tends to journalistically dither...."
5,Amazon complaint,It is a shame that you can't purchase a product and then be left alone. I purchased this book because I wanted it. I did not purchase it so I could spend time responding to someone about my purchase. If I did not want the book I would not have purchased it. The book was fine but not the Amazone follow up. It would be appreciated if you would not bother me after any future purchases.
2,"If you're a liberal-progressive who knows nothing about this book, then buy it. Otherwise, save your time and money.","I knew I was in trouble when I was a few pages into the book and the author said you're an ignoramus if you don't think humans have induced global warming. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. If you want to read a 350 page book with a liberal bias towards this subject then yeah, it's 5 stars. Woo hoo! Seriously though, it's filled with a lot of fluff and half of the book doesn't even talk about oil, it talks about alternate energies and why America isn't being liberal-progressive about it like Europe. I only finished this book because I was riding the train to work everyday and had nothing better to do. I bought it for $5 and over paid."
5,His research here is impeccable,"Petroleum is an entrenched part of our economy, dictating our politics to our social experiences: so what will happen when oil supplies are depleted? Paul Roberts' The End Of Oil: On The Edge Of A Perilous New World considers the options: especially timely since a 30-year time frame has conservatively been estimated for the depletion of accessible oil resources. Chapters cover not only projected paths if we maintain current usage and dependence levels, but consider alternatives. Paul Roberts is a regular contributor to Harper's Magazine and his research here is impeccable."
2,V isn't necessarily for Victory (or Velvet),"Some of Feather's V books are good, others not so. This fits in the middle. I guess I'm rather tired of female spies. This is a reissue; most of her earlier books are very good."
4,Not her best!,"This book is not good as ""Vice"" and ""Violet"" but definetly better than ""The Diamond Slipper"". The nicest part of ""Velvet"" is Jake, the hero's six-year-old son. That boy looks like a promising character for a sequel book!"
1,Amateur and Unedited,"This is the most amateurishly written book I have ever seen. My spouse, a university press editor, opened it at random and began laughing. I will avoid anything from this press in future. I cannot believe that an editor, or even a proof reader, came within a mile of the manuscript. The author even spells ""Air Force"" as ""Airforce"" and, sequentially, ""Vladivostok"" and ""Valdivostok"" There are even double spaces between sentences; a sure sign of a typewriter orientation, rather than a word processor. There is a tiny germ of writing talent here, which could be nourished by writing classes and an editor. However, my friend Harry Turtledove's short story ""Drang Von Osten"" does this theme better-and shorter."
2,Crying out to be written again,"After having spent a fortune getting the book from the US i was disappointed.After having read Rising Sun Victorious,Disaster at D-Day,The Moscow Option and others my expectations must have been too high.I found the book doesnt work as a novel and poorly written compared to the above books,and doesnt grab your attention in detail.If it had been personalised with deeper characterisation and more depth then this book could have been a lot better.In its defence it has a very good premise which could have been the basis of an outstanding novel if it could have been re-written.It shows how bad my opinion of this book must be for me to consider selling it only two weeks after buying it."
5,Conquest and Defeat,CONQUEST AND DEFEAT is a fast moving war story that is a fascinating read. Amateur history buffs and alternative history aficionados are always looking for technical war novels and we can never find enough on the shelf. This story is an alternative history of World War II that takes place in 1985. The Nazi's are not a factor in this book and are defeated early on. This story is about the conquests of the Japanese Empire and their struggle with their prime antagonist the United States.Pearl Harbor never happens and there is no United Nations. The brilliant and stategic battle plans behind the lines kept me turning the pages until the very end.
4,Not a bad buy for the money,This set costs much less than the same for other brands. The bits may not be the sharpest but they get the job done and are good for someone who needs them every now and then. I use mainly oak and maple so the bits really get a beating.....but they are still going.
4,"Sharp, nice patterns.",These are just perfect for my small projects around the house. I am using them in conjuction with a Bosch Colt palm router. These fellows are sharp and come in a nice little wooden box.
1,Really horrible.,Recently purchased this item for a recipe. Not only does it taste horrible - but it's hard to even get past the smell. It does not smell or taste anything like champagne! Really disappointed in this item.
3,"Be prepared for the 'F-bomb', sex and drugs.","Although very beautiful, colorful and helpful in his description of life as a blind person (that part I liked), I was put off by the use of strong language and sexual and drug references. It is entirely possible to write an eloquent, thought-provoking book without the trash. Yet for whatever reason Stephen Kuusisto found it necessary to slap us in the face with those realities of his life. Yes it's his life. I understand these are the things that really happened but I felt ill prepared for the f-word, his drug taking and talk of his sexual experiences."
5,Coll,I love this artist and was so excited to see this Cd offered. I was able to hear my favorite song and play it over and over!
1,Readings All Over the Place,"I got this thermometer to use for testing fevers in my children, but in one ear it will say they have a 102, then I check the other ear, and it's 98. I can never get the same reading twice, and I never know which one to believe. I have taken my own temperature to test it, and it often says I have a 101+ when I feel fine. This thermometer truly does not work properly; it seems to just throw out a random number every time you push the button. It's a complete waste of money."
3,Digital Ear Thermometer,"The thermometer is easy to use and I like the feature that signals a fever,even before you remove it from the ear. I received it in a timely manner and am well pleased with it."
1,Easy to use but every reading different.,"Neither my husband nor I could get consistant temeratures. I would measure 98.4 in one ear and 101.3 in the other, then moments later it would jump to 103, we never know if we really have a fever."
4,does the job. could have been better.,"It is great for protecting my Nokia 6682. The hole on the upper corner on front side it unnecessary and awkward. With the clip, the phone becomes very thick. Fitting is not the best."
5,My Son Loves This Book,"My son's 2nd grade teacher is finishing reading this book to his class, and ever since she started he comes home talking about it. He loves that it's a mystery, which is so cool to kids this age. His entire class is captivated (I saw this first hand when I was in the classroom today while his teacher was reading it). My son has asked for me to find out what other books are available in this series.It is rare to find a book that can get boys and girls so excited about reading."
1,This product and online service has been discontinued!!!!,"I recently bought this product new, but on clearance at a discount/clearance store. Thankfully, I only paid a grand total of $0.77 for it. When I went to install it, there was hardly anything on the disc, only 1.17 MB, which was enough to send me to the company's website. This is all it said: ""searchhelp.com This Domain is Under Construction Please Check Back Later Powered by Misk.com."" So, after some searching, I finally found under ""Sentry Parental Controls"" in Wikipedia this sentence: ""Sentry Predator Locator was discontinued in December 2007."" One might say, ""How can I go wrong buying this at such a dirt-cheap price?"" Well, I say that if you buy this at any price, from any place, you're simply paying too much. There's virtually nothing on the disc, and there is no website or service to go with it. Maybe the people and companies reselling them now don't know about this; I don't know. I just wanted to let whoever would read this know."
2,Great show repackaged.,"While this recording is absolutely essential for any real Ramones fans, this package is not. The whole 27 track concert has already seen a legit release as ""Ramones NYC 1978"", KBFR 400192. While I'm always up for any live recordings from Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee and Tommy, I hate being sold something I already have."
1,Poor Battery Life,The battery completely drained on mine after sitting without being charged for a few months. It will now not take a charge and the warranty on the battery was only for a year. I will not be buying a Blackburn again.
2,OK Screensaver... not as realistic as you might think,"This is an ok screen saver. Not good, but not trash. The fish are merely adequate, not exciting. Truthfully, the Microsoft fish screensaver that came with my computer is more realistic.Loading the game is a little confusing... you have to load the basic screensaver (which has one tank and three fish) and then load the rest of the fish and the rest of the scenes.The box says 57 fish. Some of them are so hideous that I have turned them off. Some of the backgrounds are nice. The 3D backgrounds look silly, and computer generated.It was 20 bucks... you might want to wait until it goes down in price. I wish that I had. This might be a better deal if it were five bucks. Or free.Update 12-13-05: This is one buggy product. I now suggest that you don't use it even if someone gives it to you. Zero Stars"
1,What?????,Talking and driving is all this group gives the viewer. Young men are giving their opinions about bigfoot (while they drive). How did this ever get out on the market??
1,This is unethical,This is probably the worst bigfoot film i have ever seen. four dudes in a hotel room talking about bigfoot does not qualify as research. don't buy it. its borderline unethical. '
4,Fantastic MP3 player,"I LOVE this thing. It sounds great. It looks great. It performs fantastic. I bought the previous model and took it back after 3 weeks when I heard this one was coming out. The first one was great, this one I like even better.If you pinned me down, I guess I might complain that occassionally you will hear the same song within a couple of hours under the ""shuffle"" play mode.I travel a lot for work so having all of my music and being able to keep pictures of my family on there is really nice. The pics are small, but you can't have everything, especially for something so small. If the pics are a very large size, though, sometimes it akes awhile to pop up.I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,IT's too expensive,K&N filters are not as good as Mobil 1 oil filters. And they are more expensive than mobile 1 filters
5,the enneagram a journey of self discovery,excellent service and condition of bookwritten with a spiritual understanding of the enneagram
1,"Hitachi, never again !!!","I bought this tv , because not expensive for the size of the screen and excellent reviews on the net. Had problems from the start. The picture excellent for about 10 minutes then the screen squeeze and see double vision. Also sometimes need to pull the plug to stop, even the power button on TV won't work. I picked a lemon,unfortunately! At least, The Brick will allow an exchange. Will never buy Hitachi product again."
5,Jeero! The perfect bedtime buddy.,"I got this for my grumpy little sleeper.At bedtime, Jeero does a ""bedtime dance"" and is then promptly snatched up & hugged.Sweet dreams always seem to follow.Thank you, Jeero!"
5,Different kinda cuddle buddy.,"My five y/o loves the UglyDoll and I have noticed that she plays with this stuffed animal. He is also her rest buddy because he can keep the ""monsters"" away while she sleeps."
3,Interesting read,"I found this book to be a very interesting account of Paul's life, while he was a Beatle, and later as a Wing. Having never read a book previously about Paul, I found it quite fascinating, though hard core fans may find that it does trash Paul and Linda to some extent. All in all, though, I did enjoy it and would recommend it."
1,I'm Speechless,"Utter waste of time. The fact that this is out of print and it's being sold for 1 cent, is testimony enough. The cover photo is really nice though. I removed it before I used the book for what it was really meant for....to house train my dog. And Amazon, there should be an option to give a book no stars. This piece of **** doesn't even deserve one star. I feel bad about that."
2,fair,"Writers and journalists who have obvious scorn for their subject can't be objective. One again, another baised ""McCartney hater"" succumbs. Paul is tossed off as a lightweight and blamed for the Beatles breakup. Other than some interesting 60's passages, this is pretty much a waste of time."
1,Genuine????,"This product does not deserve a HINT of a star rating. The price sounded reasonable for a ""genuine"" leather steering wheel cover. However, the product doesn't seem to have a shred of leather in or on it. And it stinks, literally. The smell is unbearable and NOTHING like leather. Had I put it on my car's steering wheel, I would have been sick from the fumes emanating from the synthetic composite materials. Right now, the ""genuine leather grip steering wheel cover"" lives in our backyard. We are trying to find a use for it, since it is not worthy of going to a landfill. I do not recommend this product, unless you plan to wear a mask while driving."
4,very solid cot,"This is a solid and comfortable cot. It is very easy to assemble, and comfortable to sleep on. Its also big enough so you can actually roll over in bed. I give it 4 instead of 5 only because the zipper case is bewildering with all its pockets and zippers. It obviously does something very clever, but I am at a loss to figure out what that is."
1,Dissatisified,"I would agree with some other reviews. This highchair initally seemed nice, colors were not too obnoxious and had something for entertainment. However, my son can not even see the tray to be entertained. The seat leans way too far back. We thought it was our assembly or perhaphs just not clicking into an upright position, but I believe it is a flaw in the design of this product. I would not recommend this highchair to anyone. It is comfortable for reclining, but not for eating. Isn't that what a highchair is for???"
1,DO YOU STOCK ENOUGH DIAPERS FOR THIS ONE??,"If you dont mind putting twelve diapers on at the same time to get that extra boost in height so your baby can see over the ridiculously high tray, then this chair is for you!"
2,I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this,"I bought this highchair 4 days ago and returned it today. I wish I would've read the reviews beforehand it would have saved me some time. Everything I read in the other reviews is true. I have a 71/2 month old baby girl, who is average size. The tray on this highchair was at chin height. The seat didn't seem very sturdy. I would put her in it and it wold lean back. I wasn't able to remove the tray with one hand. And the toy even stunk. The only thing I did like about the highchair was the pattern and the cover, it wasn't plastic. Don't be fooled by all the bells and whistles. And if you do decide to try it, keep your reciept because you won't have it for long."
2,poor seating,"Although this chair looks great and has some fun features it was not very functional. My son was not able to sit up straight in it. He could not get his arms up on the tray even though he's 29 inches tall. It prevents him from being able to grab ""snacks"" off the tray. After spending 1/2-1 hour to assemble it I found out that many other chairs already come assembled. Because of it's poor function I was forced to disassemble it and return it."
5,Great High Chair,"I think this is a great High Chair. I don't think it reclines too much, My son is 6 months old, In the 95th percentile for height and sits up perfectly straight and can reach the tray without problem! We;ve been using it for 2 months now. I would definitely recommend it. I don't use the activity tray a whole lot yet, he's not quite into it yet. But I'm sure in a month or less he'll be ready to play."
1,What a pain in the behind!,"Love the look. Hate everything else. My poor little guy has to eat reclining and he is nearly 14 Months old. There is nothing convenient about the tray cover. You still have to wash the tray every time its used or else suffer your child eating this mornings scrambled egg and cheese residue. Great, it folds up to nearly 98% of its original size, that's helpful. I should have bought a classic little wooden high chair. I sit in a wooden seat when I eat and am very comfortable. Why can't my child? Oh, well. In the future I'll read the reviews and save myself the money."
1,Don't buy it!,This was a spur of the moment purchase. I wish we had researched it first. The main problems with the chair are as many have mentioned: you can not sit the chair upright and the seat is too low in relation to the tray. We purchased the chair when our baby was about 4 months olds. You could only see her little head peaking over the tray. She is now 13 months old and tray is still at chest level. Several visiting children have used the chair and all have been too small. We purchased the Swing Tray Portable Booster Seat and love it. The portable booster seat is the chair we use everyday while the Evenflo sits useless in the closet. Save yourself the $75!
1,TERRIBLE CHAIR,"I have read the reviews and wish I had done so prior to buying this chair. I bought this chair 2 months ago for my 10 month old son and despite that he is TALL for his age, he can barely reach the tray. He is too reclined. My husband thought I had put it together incorrectly but after a quick visit to Babies R US last night, I realized that the chair's ""upright"" position is too reclined and indeed the chair was properly installed. All the other chairs I saw actually have an upright 90 degree option which makes sense once the babies are feeding themselves. I could not recommend this chair to anyone who wants their baby to feed on his/her own. We are still using our all in one booster seat and it works great. I wish I had not spent the $100 on this item. It's too bad because it is one of the only decent looking high chairs. I am now taking this chair to a consignment shop and cutting my losses."
1,Don't waste your money,"This chair is horribly awkward. The chair is too low in relation to the tray, and the seat reclines too far back.Do yourself a favor and shop around. This chair isn't worth it.I have other Evenflo products, and I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Dont but this High Chair not baby friendly,"My mother in law bought his High Chair for us as a gift, I hate it. My daughter is 5 months old and still can not use the tray its over her head, she has to grow so much more to even use the thing, a big waste of money.. Now that shes 5 months I usually give her a toy to sit with while we eat dinner, and the toys are always on the floor because I cant put the tray on the silly thing, also the toy that comes with it has very poor sound quality.. Not to mention she cant reach it...Please dont buy this high chair.. Youll be as sorry as I am.. I also forgot to mention now that she eats solids I have to balance feeding her and all the bowls because I cant put the tray on...."
3,entertainment tray only good on floor,"I agree with all the other reviews that the removable tray is way too high, and when you add the entertainer (the main reason I bought this chair), it's unreachable! My one year old, who is huge, still can't reach it, so we play on the floor with it.And although the seat cover is machine washable, the first time I washed it, the leather looking piping, came off.The only perk is that the entire chair height is adjustable and I slide it up to the table (so that the attached little tray is under the table), and my daughter eats her food off of the table like a big girl, but still sitting in her high chair."
2,Don't waste your money,"I think this is a very poor design. The overall concept is good. My daughter is 8 months old and of average height and she isn't able to reach the tray very well, her face bumps into the tray each time she reaches. She has to sit on a towel in order to use it correctly. The ability to fold is great seeming I do fold it down after each use due to small space but the seems where it folds gets food stuck in there and it is not easy to get out. Overall, I like the concept.....the locking wheels, one hand tray release, folding, tray insert, ability to recline and move up and down however I don't think all of the ""bugs"" are worked out yet. I am actually going to buy another chair."
1,Brace yourself!,"This chair stinks. The chair doesn't allow the child to sit in an upright position.My daughter started preschool this year and her teacher asked why she braces herself when she eats. I had to explain that she had a terrible high chair that wouldn't sit upright.I, also, agree that the tray is WAY TOO HIGH.This is an all around terrible investment.I'm expecting my 2nd child soon and will be purchasing a new high chair. This one is going in a yard sale!"
2,"Seemed ok, but wouldn't buy it.","I went to BRU shopping for a high chair for my baby boy. I didn't read the reviews for the Discovery High Chair before I left, so I can safely say that I was completely unbiased. This high chair looks very nice, I love the colors and it seems well made, so I tried placing my son in it. The chair seemed ok, except that I couldn't believe how much it reclined in the most upright position. My poor kiddo kept grunting and pulling at the sides just trying to sit upright. The toy is a nice idea, I guess, but I can buy a different high chair and put my own toy on it! I bought a Baby Trend high chair instead. We'll see how it works out. I'll let you know!"
2,thanks for the reviews,I just finished putting together the ocean wonders high chair by fisher price. After my husband and I were done I was second guessing myself wishing I had bought this one. After reading the reviews though I am glad I got the other one. If any of you are looking for a highchair read about that one. It has almost a 5 star rating. My two year old who weighs 32 lbs is sitting in it right now. We are getting ready for #2 to arrive in august. it seems to be very sturdy and easy to roll around. I am really glad that they have the review option because it seems to have kept me from making a bad purchase.
3,"Ok at first, wouldn't buy it again","I bought this high chair when my son was 4 months old. I bought it because it seemed the sturdiest of them all. It was great at first! He couldn't really sit up well by himself and the chair allowed me to lean him back. He would sit in it for hours, and since it has wheels I could wheel him all over the house with me. He loved it. He actually fell asleep in it many times, it was that comfortable! I loved the fact the the seat was cloth, I was sure that it would be better than plastic. I was so wrong. The seat cover is so hard to clean, there are so many cracks and crevices that everything gets stuck. When he grows out of it, I can not save it for the next baby, it is too gross for that. At one point it was actually stinking from rotting food, my hubby took it outside and pressure washed it, got most of the stuff out.I did get my money's worth in the beginning.......BTW the chair I own is a different print."
1,Baby can't sit UP in this!,"This chair is AWFUL! At first it seems great- when your little one is just learning to sit on their own- but then you realize the chair will NOT sit in an upright position. As some of the other reviewers have said, I too thought maybe it was put together wrong, but it's a design flaw. The toy that comes with it is not anything special either. Don't waste your money on this chair!"
1,Nightmare to clean!!,"The cloth seat is great, so is the reclining features and locking wheels, but I'd trade it all in for a high chair that was easy to clean. This high chair is full of nooks and cranies and food gets caught everywhere. My daughter is 18 months and I am giving up and looking to buy a new chair!"
1,Unsafe,"I have never written a review good or bad, I also never return items, it never seems worth my time. HOWEVER, I purchased this highchair for my one year old who needed something sturdier than our portable highchair (that sits on a regular chair). It does not sit upright, so your child is trying to eat while reclined, also the seat is very deep and tray is too high, so you can't use the tray. The toy looks nice but it is difficult to understand what they are saying and when using it in the highchair the baby can't reach it anyway. I brought it back, luckily I kept the box. I bought the Healthy Chair from Fisher price and it is MUCH better."
5,Check the Model Name!,"In reading these reviews I was shocked at how many negative ones there were. Then it dawned on me that a lot of the bad reviews were referring to this chair as ""Simplicity"". This chair is actually the Discovery which is a different and newer model than the Simplicity and the Envision. I have this chair and absolutely love it. The tray is easy to get on and off with one hand, but it can't be kicked off. Reclining is easy and I don't notice any problem with the back not being upright enough. I love that I can raise and lower it so that I'm at eye level with my baby whether I'm at the kitchen table or on the couch. The cover is easy to clean and I love that there is a vinyl cover underneath for when the cloth one is in the wash. It's lightweight, easy to manuever and overall I'm extremely pleased with my choice!"
2,lays back too far,This chair looks grat and could be if it would sit up straight. When the child sits it in it reclines to far adn is unproductive for a child who is learning to eat. Look for something else.
5,Great High Chair!,"I love this chair.Pros:1) We could start to use before my daughter could sit up on her own.2) We used it without the tray until we introduced finger foods, so one less thing to clean up.3)The fabric wipes clean easily4) The fabric does not stick to her skin like the plastic seats did.5) We use it as a booster at the table without the tray or the crossbar when our 3 year old niece comes over.6)I also like how I can snap in our toys from the exersaucer.7)The removable snap-in tray cleans up easily in the dishwasher.Cons:The toy tray is ridiculous so I just leave it off.I am perfectly happy with this purchase, I have recommended it to several friends and they have all really liked it as well."
2,"I own this high chair, BUT...","I will be returning it to the store soon! I haven't used it yet because my daughter is only 2 months old, but I do read up on reviews of products I own and I've found that because this high chair has cloth cushions, it's difficult to clean. I will be exchanging this item for a high chair with vinyl cushions, and one that sits in a more upright position. Who cares about the toy tray? There are plenty of high chair toys with suction cup bottoms for easy attachment to ANY tray. What is my kid doing in a high chair anyway?? Oh yeah- eating! So I think she'll be OK with a few toys for entertainment, a full tray of them isn't necessary."
1,Doesn't sit up right,"I purchased a Simplicity high chair almost a year ago and I stopped using it about 9 months ago. The problem with this high chair is that the seat is slightly reclined even at it upmost position. Also, the tray is much too high. I have tried everything to make it usuable, including putting phone books under the cushion to raise my daughter up more. The chair worked OK for feeding smaller infants at the reclined position, however,it is certainly not suitable for self-feeding infants and toddlers. I am very disappointed with this product. My advise: DO NOT BUY THIS HIGH CHAIR!"
3,Not great but good,"I can't get over all the really bad reviews for this highchair. I agree with the tray being too high and that there are lots of places for food to get stuck. Overall though I have been really pleased with this chair. The chair I have sits my son up all the way. The toys from the Exersaucer easily snap into the chair, which is nice. The cushion is easy to remove, washes well and is easy to put back on. I roll the chair everywhere and love that the height can be lowered so baby can be level with me when I am on the sofa. Plus this chair matches me house better then the bright blues of some of the other chairs. My only really complaint with the chair is the food tray sits way to high, even my sister 16 month old had to prop his arms up to eat off it but overall this is a nice highchair."
1,My daughter sits on phone books,"I liked this high chair at first because as a newborn I could place my daughter in the chair while I was in the kitchen in the recline position. At the time I had no idea that the upright position would not be ""upright enough"" for my daughter to eat without slouching. I call it my low rider chair. She has been sitting on phone books since about 8 months when I finally got that brillent idea. She is now 17 months and still needs the phone books. I am so fed up with this high chair and that is why I am online right now-shopping for a new high chair. Thought I would right a review to hopefully save other unsuspecting parents from the hassle and frustration of this chair. I could go on with other reasons I hate this chair, but they seem to be covered in other customer comments."
2,Baby can't sit upright and the tray is way too high,"Like other reviewers, I also thought this high chair -- with the ability to recline, the dishwasher-safe tray, etc. -- would be perfect for my baby boy. It worked well when he was first starting to eat solid foods, but once he was able to sit up on his own and reach for finger foods, we realized three things: (1) the ""fully upright"" position anything BUT upright (it's ridiculous); (2) the large tray, when attached, is WAY too high for my now-10 month old son (who is extremely tall for his age); and (3) the ""dishwasher-safe"" tray is too tall to fit in normal-sized dishwashers.My advice? Don't buy this high chair. We are currently instead using his Fisher Price Easy-Care Booster Seat for all meals (which is a wonderful item, by the way). If we buy another high chair, it probably will be a basic wooden one."
2,"Please, buy something else! We are!","We've had this high chair for six months, and have had similar problems as the other reviewers. Our daughter is 90% percentile for height and weight, so that's not the issue. This chair simply does not sit up all the way. She hates eating in it, and we're going this weekend to buy a Fisher-Price chair. Yes, it does have a nice seat and locking wheels, but that's about the only good feature. I really, really encourage you to get a different chair."
1,Evenflo does not know high chairs!,"I received this high chair from Evenflo I after I complained about their much cheaper model the Envision. They sent the Simplicity to me as a sorry replacement, and the experience has not been better, in fact---Worse! The Tray is way to high and extremely difficult to put on. The snack tray is very far out from where the baby sits. It is also difficult to release and it does not detach from the chair, making it one more difficult piece to clean. I think this chair is just a prettier version of the $40 Envision."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!!,"I registered for this highchair more based on looks thinking that the features sounded acceptable. There are a lot of design issues with this highchair and for the money, there are higher quality options. The tray is very, very high... I imagine it will fit her fine by her second birthday. Also, the fabric seat covers gaps hugely at the sides allowing food to fall under the seat cushion... its a pain to clean. The screws on the underside of the tray are rusting after just a couple of months use... not great since it does need to be washed off 3 times a day. Also the release button and mechanism stick often, requiring tugging on the tray to get it off of the chair. There are much higher quality products out there for this money!"
4,This disc is for the die-hard Furs fan.,"I am a giant Furs fan and had the opprtunity to meet them at an earth day concert in Gainesville, FL, USA in April 1990. This album contains some intriguing variations of the standards. However, if you are a fan of the mainstream Butler bros./John Ashton releases this is not for you. The tunes ""We Love You"", ""Soap Commercial"" and ""Susan's Strange"" are classic early Furs in a garage setting. The other songs are, of course great, but not polished up by production. But that's what makes them that much more treasured by the true Furs fan."
5,Alternate versions,"Fall, Sister Europe, We Love You, Soap Commercial, Susan's Strange, Into You Like A Train, On And Again, All Of This And Nothing, She Is Mine, Dumb Waiters, and Pretty In Pink make this CD worth it. It is great to hear alternate versions. I would recommend this fully to anyone who has enjoyed the Furs!"
3,Offbeat Versions of Classic Hits,"This has what might be essential material for collectors, otherwise it is mediocre. The vocals are too prominent and the backing music blurred. This is a radio broadcast so its not really ""live"" either if that's what you're looking for, its just rougher. The early tracks are the more interesting. The second album also has momements of interest. The 1990 concert is obviously when they were past their prime. Definitely not a starting point."
4,Lets Get Quiet,Nice but short and not all Gospel but Tankard is good for mixing it up.good music still classic Tankard.I just finished listening to this
3,A review of Alfred's military defeats and victories.,"This book gives a standard treatment of Alfred the Great's history and the unpleasantness visited upon England by the Danes. It's focus is on the strategy and tactics employed by Alfred in his campaigns, his guerilla war directed from Athelney, organization of a navy, and fortification of the strategically sited burhs.It's a fast read and written by a veteran of the Burma campaign in World War II so it is chock full of soldierly insights regarding logistics, terrain, and morale. Although focused on Wessex, the Danes, Franks, Mercians, East Anglians, Northumbrians and the Welsh are not ignored as participants in the various Viking raids and eventual settlements occurring in Northwest Europe. There is a great deal of emphasis on the routes by which various forces moved across England and the trackways, Roman roads, and waterways used are given detailed descriptions.I enjoyed it as a sort of Pop military history of Alfred."
2,The worst of the bunch,"I love this type of puzzle, and I've tried many of the variations that are available on this site. This one is by far the worst. The paper is unacceptable for a pencil puzzle. It's much too thin and gray, and the pencil marks don't show up well. The book is also too small, so it's hard to hold the pages open. The puzzles are too easy, and the pictures don't really look like anything.If you like this type of puzzle, there are better options available. My favorites are the two Pixel Puzzle books. (I wish they'd make more!) The paper is strong and white, the book is wire bound, the pictures are large and sharp-looking, and you'll get many more hours of puzzling fun."
4,Good size for packing along.,"I just read the previous review and I find I like this book for all the opposite reasons. I like this size. It fits into my pocketbook ready to pull out any time I'm waiting. I don't use pencils for puzzles, but I did try a pencil and agree that the pencil does not show up well. I prefer a fine point ball point and this paper is good for it. I like a paperback like this because I tear out the puzzles when they're complete and toss them.As to the puzzles themselves: they a nice size -- most are 30x35. They're challenging without being impossible. Very few are easy."
1,very disappointing,"I love these kinds of puzzles, but was very unhappy with this book. The paper is awful. If you're using a pencil you have to push down so hard it often tears through the paper. Also, the solutions in the back are difficult to see since the grid isn't visible. It's very hard to find where you've gone wrong if you make a mistake. For the price I think they could have used a better quality of paper."
3,"Entertaining, but needs work","I'm just going to add my view to the consensus for those of you who are desperate for some puzzles (as I was when I finally broke down and bought this). The puzzles are accurate, and not too hard or easy, just right! However, the quality of the paper in the book does detract seriously from the overall pleasure. You have to be careful about erasures and if you take the book with you to travel (as I do), the paper absorbs moisture from the air, and you have to dry it out before you can really get your pencil marks to show up again.A few of the puzzles looked nothing like the suggested title, and few of them were a little ""busy"" with extraneous details.Consequently, I think the book is a little overpriced for the quality of puzzle you're getting.But overall, if you're desperate for some puzzles, these are nice because there's no mistakes in them, and they are good average level puzzles.NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS."
4,Good starter text,"Nicklaus has packed a lot of information into relatively little text. All the illustrations in the cartoon format work well for many of the topics, especially for the beginner who hasn't yet swung the clubs much or just enough to realize it aint easy. I read this first then went on to read ""Golf My Way"", a later Nicklaus book with more text and detail. Note there are a couple things Nicklaus suggests in Lesson Tee that he later changed in his own game."
1,Unacceptable quality,"When I first opened the package, I was satisfied with the quality. There was a few marks on the pages but acceptable. I put it on a table and 24 hrs later it warped in all directions. I can only imagine that it must have been in a flooded area of a house or building. I am real disappointed. I would have sent it back to the seller, but I didn't keep the address, thinking it was ok."
5,Pyrates toys,"Santa got this for our son last Christmas and he screamed when he opened it. This was a hard to find item, and we're glad we finally found it to complete all his Pyrates sets. He loves it, and loves putting all his ships together and playing with them. It's been endless hours of fun for him. This has been a nice addition to all his pyrates sets. How cool is that, having an island all your own? He loves playing with it, and his friends like playing with it too. Every once in a while we put it all back in the box and stash if for a few months, but when it comes back out of the box, he plays with it like he's never seen it before. Easy directions, he put it together all by himself with no problems."
2,Falls apart way too easily,"My 6-year old wanted this toy for Christmas and I spent about an hour putting it together. Within 2 minutes blocks were popping off and it was falling apart. If you buy this toy, I suggest putting it on a shelf and ""looking"" at it. I also bought him the 2 ships and I am not even going to bother opening them. I am returning them for a more ""durable"" children's toy."
4,great diaper bag!,"I love this bag. There are lots of useful pockets inside & out & it's really cute. The fabric is kind of satiny, so it's easy to clean, and the handles are coated with a laminate-type material so they won't get all grungy. The only reason I gave this bag a 4-star is because it kind of flops down if it isn't full. I wish the sides were a bit more sturdy to stand upright on their own. Other than that, it's perfect for what I need!"
4,Surf's Up Trend Lab Diaper Bag,"I love this diaper bag as it has a lot of room, can be easily wiped down and matches my bedding. There are a lot of compartments inside to store bottles, diapers, wipes, paci's, blankets, and changing pad. However I do not like the straps. They constantly fall off my shoulder, even when it's completely full. Everything else is great except for the straps! I will be purchasing another one because it's hard enough to carry diaper bag, bottle bag and baby in car seat out of daycare and then to have the diaper bag fall off your shoulder...so annoying!"
1,Not great.,Very disappointed in this bag. Weird material. No zipper. No way to hang it on my stroller. Not enough pockets. I returned this item.
4,Cool Chair,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and it is worth the price. Pretty sturdy, nothing fancy, but definitely worth the price."
1,Very disappointing,"This book is very disappointing. The writing is not particularly good, only some of the characters are credible and the plot is weak. The ending is terribly disappointing - it just seemed to stop when she ran out of ideas. Don't bother. There are much better books to read."
1,What happens when a pack of chimps create a word processor?,"You get WordPerfect 12. Far from perfect, this error-filled mistake of a word processor will drive you to get Microsoft Word...if your head doesn't explode from frustration first. Its unwieldy interface ensures you rarely find what you need, and its image support is non-existent. The simplest formatting commands are a chore in WordPerfect, and frequent errors promise a simple graphic import will take 5x as long as it should. Importing graphics is an excruciating process because it frequently locks up mid-import, and most of the time blacks out the top half of an image. Congratulations Corel, you have made the most user-unfriendly word processor imaginable. You have lost a customer for life."
4,Corel WorkPerfect Office 12 Standard,Installation states needed further software to utilize properly. My lack of experience probably is the problem. Delighted I got the software and will order more in the near future. Thank you for giving me the installation code numbers which were lacking in the original shipment.Dolores mc kenna
2,Loyal customer moves on,"Corel WordPerfect Office 12I started using WordPerfect in the olden days before Windows, and I have used it ever since--upgrading over time, but 12's crashing is pitiful. So now I will not upgrade to the latest because I no longer trust it and meanwhile--at last--Word has improved. It's not perfect, but WordPefect is no longer perfect."
1,Don't waste your money...,"WordPerfect Office 12 is simply not good. You're better off paying a little more money to get Microsoft Office. Even trying to format an outline I am finding to be impossible. QuatroPro isn't so bad, but WordPerfect is really poorly designed and a waste of money."
1,Such a lie in the name alone,I recieved this program with both the Dell computers my family have bought and I must say it is nowhere near perfect. To use any sort of logic is to run into serious problems with this application. My mother continues to have problems even figuring out how to change from print view to normal view.I had to use this program when I had to do projects for my Intro to Computers class and I ended up almost failing it due to the screwed up placement of options.There are free products which are much better then this series of applications. Try Openoffice
1,PATHETIC,This is the worst program ever.It gets beat in every category by word.This is overpriced garbage that has many bugs and kinks.Corel puts out a terrible product at a horrible price.IF YOU ARE BUYING A DELL PAY THE FEE TO UPGRADE TO WORD. It cost a little more now but it is better than alot more later!
1,word perfect SUCKS,this software is horribale for any oneit to over pricedit takes for ever to figure out and I work with computer software I suggest microsoft suit 2006 for about 100 dollars it's worth it u also get a encyclopedia and a travel programword perfect will delete items after 1 yeardon't ever get it if getting a dell just pay the extra money and get word u will be thank ful
5,WordPerfect Office 12,"I'm a die-hard WordPerfect user, so consider the source!That said, one important note not present in Amazon's info: WPO 12 also works in Windows 98 SE ... try that with MSO later versions!Several fixes have been observed (compared to WPO 11), including (and important to me) that using Wp's Publish to PDF again saves multiple colored text on the same line correctly again (it worked OK in Wp10).Great product, particularly for those wanting improved round-tripping with MS Word files, opening or saving as."
5,Great shoes,"Hi, as a lifeguard, I needed good flip flops, these are stylish and made from high quality materials, recommended 100%, especially for the price."
2,Some interesting stuff at the end,"The book is split into 3 parts: two sci-fi stories from Richard Shaver's Lumeria series and three chapters on hollow earth history. The stories are stupid and boring. The only reason you would want to read them is if you were into Sci-Fi history. I couldn't even finish the Return of Santhas. The last three chapters on hollow earth history were quite interesting though. They follow some quack and some reasonable theories about tunnels in South America and Asia. He does a good recap of the Incan/Spanish conflict that led to the theories on lost cities of Gold. So parts 1&2 (no stars), part 3 (4 stars)"
2,Not so great,"This book didn't turn out to be as interesting as I thought it would be. He reprints the entire 1948 book ""I Remember Lemuria"" by Richard Shaver. Which I found pretty boring. Childress' comments on the hollow earth were interesting though, but I wouldn't have bought the book for them."
1,If you're into the Occult Buy this book...,"I bought this book thinking it would be a good interesting read. It was for a couple chapters and I couldnt finish it for fear of being ill. He basically borrows theories and other tidbits from other books by Occult authors. It talks about ""The Great White Brotherhood"" but doesnt mention that this Brotherhood is the top echelon of the Illuminati Occultists who rule this world. The first story was good because it shows what mind control can do to a person and reminds me of what Philip K Dick once went through. This book has limited documentation if any and no definitive answers and just mystery and doesn't resolve much. If you want a good read with documentation pick up ""Bloodlines Of The Illuminati"" by Fritz Springmeier. Its probably the most amazing book you will ever read!"
1,German TV program with poor production values and bad sound.,"It was sad for me to see a band I revered so much as a youngster struggling through this cheesey looking, horrible sounding TV concert. I guess I'll just stick to my fading memories of their glory days..."
4,America-In Concert-Germany,"This is a very good show with America, it has several songs not played in concert in the States. Most all of their well known hits are on here and the camera work is good, lots of close ups of Dewey and Gerry. The show is only them singing, no announcer, and no breaks,.....each song is announced by a line across the bottom of the screen. A great gift for any America fan!"
1,Almost fit ! ! !,"These COBRA bars look good once they are installed. But you would think for $200 they would bolt right on without having to modify the mounting holes at all. Granted, putting the bolts in the upper mount through the gusset in the frame is a little tight, which is to be expected. I had to use a deburring tool and an air drill to elongate the mounting hole in the lower right bracket. What really should have been a no-brainer ended up taking three hours and ticking me off."
5,Essential Sonic and Scottys and Gary...Rendevous of the Titans.,It is more soulful and hard than Humble Pie at their peak yes lo-fi but don't let that scare you....get it you won't regret it...I will be listening to this for the rest of my life...RIP Sonic and Ron.
5,This is Rock n Roll,"Amazing is pretty much all I can say about this box set, American Rock n Roll at it's finest, Just enough of that Detroit dirt & sleaze that we all know and love, But also the technical musicianship of Fred ""Sonic"" Smith that gives it the seriousness & power that cannot be duplicated. It has been said that City Slang is the perfect rock n roll song, I'd have to agree."
4,Classic Detroit Rock from the crypt,"Before you buy this box set, be sure that you have all of the classic Stooges/Iggy Pop, MC5, Mitch Ryder, and any other favorite Detroit recordings. Now if you are still hungry for that hard gritty urban sound BUY THIS BOX. Four live shows and two discs of various studio pieces all add up to a lost treasure. Like most treasure some pieces are more polished than others but this is a find for fans of the Motor City sound.The earlier recordings sound fine in the car and the later live shows pass audiophile muster. I have to pay careful attention not to turn it up so loud that I fry my Vandersteens."
4,worth the money,"Sure it's expensive and it has a lot of stuff you'll only play once or twice but you need to get this if you have any interest in high energy rock & roll. I had been a huge MC5/Stooges fan for years but knew very little about this band. I'm very glad I picked this up. Fred's playing is incredible. The band is so good, it's a shame they never got to do more real recording. But this is all we got, so get it while you can!Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
4,All second/third time brides will appreciate..,"the info and advice this book offers. It covers a lot of topics and touches on may issues that the generic wedding planning books do not. I can recoomend this book to anyone getting hitched a second time, or for any women who are marrying previously married men."
5,"Small, Attractive, Functional - just what I was looking for!","What an attractive little address book this is. Eighteen entries per letter, with spaces for two phone numbers, fax and email. Does not have birthday entry, but has additional space below each entry to write in what you want.Compact and tastefully adorable. The artwork is wonderful. Wolf Erlbruch links together interesting and unlikely animal pairs in his subtle illustrations.Highly recommended if you seek a small, yet fun and functional address book."
3,It's an ok DVD,More of a documentary history of Christmas sacred music than a music DVD. If you like sacred music history you will love it.
1,Not up to expectations ...,"I give these people credit for trying, however, very amateurish. A HUGE disappointment in the overall product."
2,Mic Trouble,"I first bought (yes I said `first') this item when I got the set of Karaoke Revolution disk. Boy did we have fun, then, at first it was just a little noise coming from the speakers. Than intermittent shorting out of the sound. Then nothing. This after just a few days.Must admit Amazon was great in the way they handled the matter, they asked me to return the item, and sure enough shortly after a replacement came Boy did we have fun(of course we handled this new one with baby gloves), Did not help, within two weeks the same thing happened again, dead, kaput.I had to buy another one (this time one that I saw in a store). So I am now on the third one within weeks. Other wise works pretty good (that is, when and while it works)First two were very easy to go bad, hope I have better luck third time a round.Will keep you up dated on how long this one works."
4,Works with Guitar Hero World Tour,"I bought this, unsure if I would have a compatibility issue or not. I am pleased to say that it works fine with my daughter's PS2 Guitar Hero World Tour game. The sound is fine, I haven't noticed any problems with it."
1,urgh!!,"got this mic along w/ karaoke revolution 3 as a christmas gift. worked awesome. mic picked up my voice even when i was singing really low. we had the static not too long after and had assumed we were singing too close to the mic or that we had set it on sensitive. however on 12/27 (3 days of play), it died. i went to put my son down and when i came back, that was it. no forewarning. nothing. if anyone out there finds a good mic (i've yet to find out w/ usb ps2 compatibility) or headset, please let me know. thanks. other than that, it was fun while it lasted. but mic is a total letdown."
1,SOOOOO Disappointed,"We love Karaoke Revolution games and were so excited to get our new hand held microphone. Amazingly we all scored platinums with this mic but that was only the first two days of playing. Like one of the other reviews it started with intermittent crackling then sound going out totally to now NOTHING. It's totally gone. I want to buy another, but after reading the reviews on the second and third purchases I refuse. Hopefully Logitech comes out with something more sturdy!! Don't waste your money, stick with the headset until something better comes along."
3,The only thing going...until something better comes along.,"I have every Karaoke Revolution game and have used the headset and three of these microphones. The headseat is useless so this microphone is the only other option.The mic picks up your voice great but is not very durable. I have three of them and only one works now. They last about 6 months for me then either stop working or start with a lot of static. They get shorts in the cords very easily.I am a 42 year old who still has my original Nintendo and the controllers still work so it's not the way I am using it. I am experienced in using fragile video game equiptment.This microphone works well when it works. I wish there were another option, wireless would be awesome. Maybe make the cord rotate so it doesn't kink up or get a short. Since we like to sing duets on Karaoke 3 I will have to end up buying yet another one of these, as my second one just died.If they only improved the durablity then it would be perfect."
4,This is better than the headset!!,"This microphone is so much better when used with Karaoke Revolution games. You don't have to keep adjusting the headset with each different player, you just pass the mic!! Mine worked great until my dog chewed it, so I'll be buying two more to go with the Karaoke Revolution 3 game!! This is an excellent price too! It costs $20 on Logitech's website."
1,Fun while it lasted,Fun while it lasted. Got it for Christmas and after the 4th use it is DEAD. Nothing.The kids are so disapointed.
4,Logitech is Tried and True,"I've owned different types of logitech products, that have stood the test of time and abuse, with the exception of their PS2 wireless controller, but that's another review. I've bought this mic about over a year ago from writing, and I was amazed by some negative ones, and was grateful that mine hasn't acted as described. This mic has seen many use from playing the Karaoke Revolution series and the Rockband series of games, for me it has worked flawlessly. But then I have started to notice hearing static, and I noticed that when I switched it to a different USB port (USB1), the static goes away, which leads me to think that it might be the USB port of the PS2 which is the cause for many negative feedbacks."
1,Do Not Buy This!!,"I purchased this for my daughter's birthday to go with the PS2 Karoke Revolution game she received. The michrophone quit working after about 30 minutes!! I contacted Logitech for a replacement, and it was a HASSLE!! I received the replacement about 2 weeks later. That microphone worked for 1 month before also breaking. Obviously, there are some design problems with this product. It was not used in any way except for the way it was intended to be used. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
1,Will not work with Singstar,"I bought this microphone for my daughter for Christmas, and it will not work with Singstar on Playstation 2.It was a recommended product when I bought Singstar, but it is not compatible."
1,Konami really needs to dump Logitech...,"This microphone came bundled with Konami's excellent Karaoke Revolution Party. First, it's notable that it plugs into the USB ports on the PlayStation 2, not the traditional controller ports. I believe the USB ports are only detected when the peripheral is plugged-in before powering on the PS2. That quirk notwithstanding, this microphone is poorly constructed. From the first song, there was crackling and static. Since then, it has been very temperamental and works intermittently. I'm afraid to even sway for fear it may upset the cheap wiring. Bad."
3,Play Station microphone,"My new puppy chewed the old PS2 microphone, since I borrowed it I was desperate to replace it. The new PS2 microphone works great.... and the person I borrowed it from had no idea it had been replaced."
1,:( so sad,man i had fun.. for what?! a hour? then i come back so my bf and i could jam out.. and wham not even a hour the mic wasnt working... im not happy.. i love karoke and this was a total disapointment. after reading about the headphones and what not.. i dont know what to do.. i cant afford to keep buying microphones cuz the manufactors cant figure out how to make a microphone that is sturdy enough. :( dont buy the game unless u have another option for microphones.. cuz im sorry to say.. logitechs version of microphone is crappy.. best of wishes to all if u can find something that is worth it!!!!
1,Deception,"This is my first shop at Amazon I got completely frustated. The site showed me a microphone for PS2 Rockband,and what did I get? Microphone only for PS3. I felt like an idiot. False advertisement."
1,misunderstood the item I ordered,"This USB MICROPHONE was a christmas gift for my 20 year old grandson. He just told me that the one he wanted was with the ear pieces, in order to carry on a discussion with the person with whom he was playing the game. Grandma misunderstood. Is there anything that can be done to correct my error? Maybe you have earphones that do come with the microphone.Thank you for your interest and your time.Hope Knechtl"
1,"A waist of money, unfortunately",like other reviewers say. it was good while it lasted. once it gets static (it easily can just by you touching a sweater or your hair and then touching the mic) then its all gone. i played a few hours and it died. simply a waist of money.
1,very bad,"The adv said it works for playstation 2 which it did not at all. I plug it in and it did not even recognize it. So they should not play customers this way. I wrote a letter to the seller, and he did not answered. So people don't buy this."
1,Died after two times!,"I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing, it completely died! What a complete disappointment. Save your money!"
4,Playstation 2 Microphone,The product is very sturdy and very much more durable for smaller children than the headset microphone. Purchased my daughter the headset microphone for Christmas and it was broken in a few days. We purchased this one after and it has withstood quite well. Great product!!!!!
1,PLaystation 2 USB Microphone,This product worked for about a week then the mic stopped working. We love the mic but I took it to several places and they say there is a short in the mic. I ended up buying another mic locally. I was very disappointed with this purchase. I think the mic was not the mic that goes with the playstation. I think it was a clone.
4,PLAYSTATION MICROPHONE,GREAT MICROPHONE FOR THE PRICE. THE KIDS LOVE IT WITH HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL SING IT FOR PS2.
2,Stopped working after two days,"Bought a mic to use with Karaoke Revolution Party (which only comes with one mic), but after two days one of the two mics broke."
1,Great Idea - Poor Quality,"The Karaoke games for the PS2 are incredibly fun. We play them with the kids; we play them with adults. We just love them! We totally crack up when we play.Unfortunately the microphones short out very quickly (within days) and we are very careful with them.We are going on our 6th PS2 USB microphone. If the games were not so much fun, I would not keep buying these horrendously made mic's.We tried to use the Sing Star mic's with the Karaoke games but they are not compatible.Logitech needs to wake up and wire these things properly."
4,Great Mirophones...,We got two mics and love them. The cords are really long so we love that. I only wish they were marked like the Sing-Star mics. We were confused at first but figured it out. They came in the mail really fast so that was Great.
4,It does the job. No problems so far.,"We've only used the mic (and another that is identical) about 10 times now, but no complaints so far. My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time. We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2.It would be nice if there was a gain adjustment right on the mic, but that may be a limitation of the PS2 or the game, so I can't hold that against the mic without knowing more.The cord is pretty long, I'd say 12' or so. Whether or not it works on a PC or if a PC-USB mic works on a PS2, I don't know.Since I don't have any complaints, you might wonder why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. To me, 4 stars means ""It does the job and has no major flaws"". 5 stars means ""This thing is awesome!"""
4,Worked for me,I have been waiting for this for a while. I hated the headset. I have had it for a month or more and it works great. Easy to pass around. You really don't have to set the mike for everyone it ready to go. Makes the game move smooth instead of waiting for everyone each time to get the mic right for them. No problems with it.
4,Logitech Mic for PS2,"I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2. The quality of the sound is awesome, and my kids are having a blast with it. The price is reasonable. My kids take very good care of things, but I'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment. I will probably end up buying another one!"
4,Extreme Reactions,"I think most people will have an extreme reaction to this book. You will really like it; you will really dislike it; or you will be really confused as to whether or not you like it. With a story that can evoke such strongly varied reactions, it is worthy of praise no matter what the result."
5,All time classic,"Mr Benson opened up the world of James Bond to so many of us with this book. Covering Fleming, the novels, the films, and the entire Bond phenomenon, it was excellent research in the time before the Wikipedia and the IMDB. Well researched, well written, well done!"
2,ridiculous,"I can't believe that it is not stated that the battery pack is not included! What a disappointment. I did luck out on finding the battery at toys r us, however was shocked that it was another $30.00. I have 3 children and try and spend the same amount on all of them each christmas, guess I failed this year. Even power wheels comes with the battery. If they would just sell it for the $100 it really costs people wouldn't be so mad! I was going to buy one for each of my son's, good thing I didn't!"
4,"shell shocker a great toy,but pricy","once you've charged it for 4 hours, the toy really moves. it's quick gets around really well. we live in the desert and for a toy that can play in the dirt is great. a little too advanced for a 7 year old, but my husband thinks its great.it manuvers really well and try not to hit anyone with its tail, it hurts.overall, a great christmas gift if you spend the money to get it running.100 bucks to get it up and going."
1,Didn't even make it through Christmas day!,The gears stripped and broke off before the battery ran out of juice on the first day. This is way too expensive of a toy to last only 3 hours. DO NOT GET SHELL SHOCKER!
2,SHell SHocked,I bought this toy for my son and with in two hrs of play time I had the same problem the gears are shot and the fins will not open. I call Mattel (after a few hrs trying) and they are sending me a return label so I can get a refund. I have to send in two fins and the remote.
1,Extremely Misleading Advertising!!,"I now have to try to find this battery charger, that is $30.00, to make this toy work. The charger is unique only to the ""Shell-Shocker"". I have an immune disorder and can not run all over town to find this charger. Even if I find it online, I will have to pay for express deliver to receive it by Christmas. Today is December 20th. When going to wrap the Shell-Shocker this morning, I see (in a 2X3 inch square down in the corner of the box) that another purchase of a ""TYCO battery pack and charger"" must be made to operate this toy. To Fisher-Price, ToysRUS and TYCO- this is a very unethical way to do business. Why not charge the necessary price for the toy and include the charger/battery pack and keep the consumers from having to deal with all this anxiety?? I'm very,very disappointed. Robyn"
1,This toy requires a $30 DOLLAR BATTERY PACK!,"The toy itself is fine, pricy, but fine. However, it's one thing for your kid to open a gift on Christmas morning and realize you have to run to the gas station for a forgotten battery. It's totally another thing to spend $70 on something you can't even use without the $30 battery pack that has to be purchased separately at a REAL store. Tyco didn't want to price this thing at $100 so they TRICKED their customers with a simple ""batteries not included"" label. If you want this toy for your child, just realize...it ACTUALLY costs $100!!!"
1,Might be a Great Toy,"Guess I didn't read the fine print either. I saw the ""batteries not included"" on the box and purchased a 9v battery for the remote. Christmas morning, no battery pack. Wal Mart (where I bought it) doesn't have them. Drove 90 miles to another Wal Mart, they don't have them either. After another 38 miles to Toys R Us and still no battery pack, headed home. This was the ONE thing my daughter asked for....and she can't play with the darn thing. If anyone has ideas on where to get a battery pack in Colorado I'd be open to suggestions! The customer service rep at Wal Mart told me they don't stock them and she doesn't think they ever will. The second Wal Mart said ""go to walmart.com and order one."" Nothing available!!!"
2,Gears are no good,We purchased the Shell Shocker for our son and it was a great toy until the gears broke and it would no longer morph correctly. We exchanged it for a replacement and the same thing happened with the new toy. My nephew also received one for Christmas and is having the same problem. We are going to return the second one and get something else entirely. It just seems as if the toy was not made strong enough to endure it's movements and features.
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of the shell shockers for my sons. I knew about the batteries and didn't find anything deceptive about it (read the box folks!) I also knew enough to get one in the 27 and 49 mhz, again, doesn't take a genius. However, the first stopped morphing within 15 minutes of use and now the second one broke with the same problem. Prior to buying these I did my research and found the only complaint being the battery and now I'm seeing virtually all of them with broken gears. My only problem now is how to explain it to my boys on why these toys from Santa don't work."
1,Big Waste of Money!!!!!,"We got this toy for our son for christmas, it was his big request on his list. We played with this toy for less than 1 hour before the gears stripped, it will not morph anymore, and it is completely useless. What a rip off!! It was very disappointing for our son, there is no reason a toy that costs as much as this one does should have so many complaints about it, and I cannot believe that the people at TYCO don't know that this toy breaks so easily if they did testing on it."
1,Great marketing for a bad toy equals consumer beware.,I'm sorry if you got this toy and set it under the tree thinking it was a good idea. It cost too much and then took a charger not included that cost just as much as the toy. It didn't perform anything like the tv said it would. My son rejected it less than 5 mins into play and he and I returned it the next day. TYCO now Mattel this was not a good idea.
1,Where's the battery?????,"My son received Shell Shocker for Christmas, but the gift giver did not include the battery pack. After the initial disappointment, I assured my son that the day after Christmas we would run to Toys R Us and get a battery pack. Well it's been two weeks and numerous trips to Toys R Us, Meijer, Target, etc., and still no battery pack. We check online five times a day to order one and they are always sold out. What kind of company would sell X amount of toys and not make sure that the only battery that makes the toy work would be readily available.The sad thing is that an employee of Toys R Us informed us that the exact same thing happens every year with Tyco's most popular new toy. I see a pattern here, why doesn't Tyco? Get someone with a little common sense on the battery pack issue. I would love to include a real review if we ever get to play with this toy."
4,Lots of fun!,"I bought this toy for my son before reading the reviews and I'm so glad I did! It is TONS of fun, lots of laughs as the ""thing"" crashes into walls and bookshelves. No, Amazon doesn't mention the need for the battery pack but it IS right on the outside of the box and I purchased one right along with the toy (the total $100 price tag was, I admit, a bit tough to swallow). I even had the presence of mind to charge up the battery before giving the toy to my son, so it was ready to go the minute he opened the box. We DID have a problem after the first few times with the wings not morphing in sync. But, I called TYCO and they were very helpful -- it's just a matter of unscrewing the side that's open, lifting it up slightly and letting the wings flap down. When you screw it back on it's fine! My son LOVES this toy! Can't wait for springtime to take it out to open terrain. Just be sure to watch that tail, it really packs a punch if it hits you."
1,"Not good, don`t buy it","It wroke 2 minutes later after openning, my husbund try to fixed but surprice all the inside partes are ""plastic"" you can`t fixed. DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY."
4,Battery Problems?,What kind of idiot buys an electronic Christmas/birthday present without checking what kind of batteries it takes?Unless you're illiterate you have no legitimate gripe.
3,A TOY REVIEW PLEASE,"People, can you please quit complaining about the battery pack and tell us whether or not the toy is fun, functional, and worth the headache? If consumers are going to spend the $100 for the product, we would like to know whether or not it is worth it. That's what people are looking for here."
1,don't even look at it- such a rip-off,i'm back on this website 2 days after christmas-believe me - i have better things to do . this toy is the worst christmas present my son has ever recieved. the battery pack is $30. i'm buying it now and i am really annoyed about it. this toy is ugly and way too expensive. i should have bought a rc truck for him and not gotten involved with this. don't believe the hype!!
2,$30 Battery to buy Seperate from $70 toy,My kid opened this on christmas to find he can't use it till I get a special battery for it. The battery is ONLY sold at Toys-R-Us and cost $30. The toy itself was $70 and it doesn't run very long when fully charged up.
1,Worst toy of the season,It may sound kind of a repetition but all those who gave this toy as a present were totally disappointed after Christmas Day that their $100 investment was a total waste. I have the same symptoms: broken gears; fins don't work on one side; you have to start/restart to like 3 minutes of play before they eyes started to blink rapidly... I almost wanted to pick it up by it's stupid tail and smash it to a tree but got a better idea...I will call Tyco/Mattel tomorrow and demand a refund or better yet a recall for this product.
1,"Beware, do not buy this!","I should have insisted on my money back the first time! Within 10 minutes of opening our first shell shocker it jammed up and wouldn't work properly. Since I had already spent the $[...]for the battery that can only be used in this toy I decided to try another one (after a long interchange with the Tyco people and a 6 week wait). The second one finally arrived and once again, my son had it out of the box for not more than 15 minutes and it was obvious that it wasn't preforming as promised. So, if you do choose to buy - make sure you save your receipts for the toy and the battery!"
2,Battery Shocker,"Well I'm well aware that these toys now require seperate expensive battery packs but what disappoints me most is the Flex Pack battery pack I bought last year for the Terrain Twister apparently won't work on this model because now they have renamed it Flex Pro Pack (or something like that). I didn't mind spending the money on the battery as I ""assumed"" the battery would work in several of Tyco's RC toys. I am disappointed but it's too late now--already have ordered this hard to find toy.At least I found out before Christmas morning and I'm sure my son will enjoy his Shell Shocker!"
3,Still believing in Santa Clause,I have to say as much as they advertised this on the kids channeland thats all my boy wanted from Santa clause! Tyco could ofincluded the battery pak in the box with The shell ShockerThe Red Rider B B gun you may shoot your eye out but you don'tneed a $30.00 batter back.Make that $41.00 to get it in time for Christmasbecause it didnt come with the the Shell Shocker that I purchasedat a local store months ago.
1,"cheap junk, company won't even back it","It broke within a couple minutes from the cheap plastic. Mattel won't fix it or replace it because there was a little bit of snow in the grass. So if you do get this make sure there is no dew, no mud or moisture in your yard or they will not replace it. All terrain my foot.... They won't cover it if there is any form of water even if it isn't liquid."
5,Shell Shocker,"The tyco r/c shell shocker is a very big cool looking vehicle. It is very fast on carpet, it also goes in mud,mulch,grass,and it also climbes over things. It has little red eyes that light up when it is on. Shell shocker is about 50.00 and requires a 30.00 battery pack, which it tells you you need it on the box. Shell shocker is worth every penney that you spend on it. Another great r/c from tyco."
1,Disappointing,"Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later.Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there."
1,Broken the first day after Christmas,Had high hopes for this one. It's definitely a basement or outside toy. Noisy but we got a kick out of it. It goes FAST with the tail slamming around as it rolls. First time outside the day after Christmas it rolled up under the car and stopped and now the fins on one side will not close up. JUNK - will be returned.
1,SHAME ON TYCO,"I don't know if it's fun or not, eight days after christmas and I still haven't been able to find a batterie. I noticed half the people who gave this toy a good review also have not played with it, they're just stuck on the hype, and they want to make those of us who didn't understand the batterie requirement (a huge amount of people) feel silly. The number of people who say it broke the first day concerns me a lot!"
2,Battery not included?,"We just purchased this toy for $75 including taxes, I couldn't believe the battery does not even come with it. The disappointment of our son on Christmas morning was reason enough not to purchase another Tyco product. This toy is not cheap to begin with and then we have to pay another $30 to get the battery? Which is required to play. Very disappointing."
1,Stupid piece of crappy crap!,"Yeah, we got sucked into the hype. ""Hottest toy of the year"" all that stupid greedy marketing propaganda. Bought it and it broke within 20 minutes. Scared the bejesus out of cats. Son would rather play with terrain twister from last year which was much better product. So many stupid restrictions -- no snow, no rain, not too much sun, don't play in the street -- where can you play with it??? Returning it tomorrow."
3,Was anyone's High School actually like this?,"I felt that the movie itself had serious problems (not knowing what direction it wanted to go in, leading to pacing catastrophes) but was made watchable and occasionally really funny by its exellent cast. Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh (who looked about 12) were very good, but my favourite by far was Phoebe Cates as Leigh's good-natured, Promiscuous friend. She had an energy and charm beyond everyone else."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Not up to par with Cameron Crowe's later work, FTaRH features a pastiche of scenes and characters in search of a plot or guiding thread; 80s nostalgia aside, it's not a very special or interesting movie."
1,Horrid transfer from video,"This is not high-def. Just because it's 1080P doesn't mean a thing. This is very clearly a poor scan from a lousy print or from a video source. The resolution is horrible, the picture is grainy and washed out.Needless to say, it looks TERRIBLE. In fact, I've seen TV broadcast look better.Absolute garbage, good thing Target only charged $9.99 or I'd be really pissed.Movie, btw, classic. Love the film, hate the blu-ray.10/6/12:For those who think my review harsh, as I write this the film is airing on Cinemax and it looks 10X better than this blu-ray. There's no grain at all, the colors aren't washed out, it's much better. My wife and I are both watching and beyond a doubt much better than the blu-ray, that's not okay, it's f---d up."
3,I love this Movie... But something missing,You can watch this Movie on VH1. Jeff Spicoli Mick Jagger story is missing.Stacey seeing Ron's car in the parking lot and she telling Linda her plan to try to win Ron back. Even Hallie Todd scene was cut out. If network going to put it on Tv they should play the DVD version.So people won't go out and buy this movie and feel they were rip off.
5,Best first of its kind,"The grandaddy of all teenage comedies,and, thus, the best one. And, to know that it's based real stories just makes it that more cleaver."
4,Phoebe Cates is Hot,"Sean Penn is pretty hilarious as the strung out sufer dude, but the real reason to see this is if you're a guy and haven't had the opportunity to ever see the Phoebe Cates poolside fantasy sequence, wow."
5,*****A tennagers spirit movie!!! Very cool dude!!!*****,*****Hey Dude this is a very buzzed movie! I really love it! I think I will buy it!I see it at my school.My favorites caracters are Stacy Hamilton because is a very beautiful girl with a lot of finess!! And this movie reflect today's life but not completely because they not talk about the sexual protection and today the is condom all tenagers have sexual relations wear the condom!In Fast Times they don't talk about AIDS or other Venerials Diseases and this subject is really present in teen's life.Well is a SUCCESS MOVIE !! If you have not see Fast Times at Ridgemont High go to the video club and rent it you will don't regret!!!*****
3,Nostalgia at its best.,"It's rare that a movie tries to be socially responsible while still off the wall. Its a multi-plot movie about dating, responsibility, friendship, and drugs. The comedy of the movie has since been copied so often its fun to see where it originated; and how it was once done well.Notes:-It's heavily rooted in the 80's. -Political Correctness wasn't conceived at the time. -The music was fun (not depressing like today's).** Look for cameos by Eric Stoltz and Anthony Edwards as Spicoli's stoner friends, and Nicholas Cage (listed as Nicholas Coppola) as one of Brad's preppy friends."
4,More from the 70's than from the 80's!!,"There is NO DOUBTH that this movie is from the 80's ! but it was released in 1982 so the kids have the 70's in mind and the ""hair metal band"" were not THAT famous back then, (they became more famous in 1984).You hear the kids talking about Van Halen, Blue Oyster Cult, Cheap Trick, Led Zeppelin and Earth Wind & Fire. Not olny that, there is a grafitti in a bridge that say's ""disco sucks"" and one of the kids was driving a ""Firebird"" car which was wery popular back in the 70's.If you are looking for a crazy teen stoner movie of the 80's the this one is not perfect! Try looking for one that was made in the mid or late 80's or maybe if you know about a present teen stoner movie based on the mid 80's then that one would be great.But don't get me wrong, this movie is great for stoner movies! Try also Dazed and Confused which is the same as this one but based on 1976.Adios."
4,THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD,THIS MOVIE ARE THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I HAVE SEE THIS MOVIE AND I HAVE SEE SO MUCH MOVIE IN MY LIFE AND THIS MOVIE ARE MUCH ORIGINAL.BUT THIS MOVIE ARE VERY OBJECTOR BECAUSE HE HAVE TOO MUCH STORY AND IT'S VERY DIFICULT TO FOLLOW THIS MOVIE.I THINK OF JEFF SPICOLI ARE THE BEST ACTOR OF THIS MOVIE AND STACY HAMILTON ARE NOT A GOOD ACTRESS.BUT IT'S A GOOD MOVIE AND I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
3,A review from a teenager of 99,"Hi, my name is Stella and I'm in grade 9. I saw the movie at school with my class and I just love it. The storie describes teenagers' life in their memorial high and youth. Some of the scenes are too exagerated but not bad at all. Everythings are kind could happen in real life of teenagers. It's really interessing to see the different between the beginning of 80's and ending of 90's. So cool man d=p It must have more kind of movie like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""."
4,Fast times rules,"Fast times is best times! Fast times is one of the movie that I have seen, and I really like it. The character are good written and well act. My favorite character is Jeff Spicoli, he's a very cool dude.He and Brad are the two best character that I like.Back then and now are not quite similar because today, lots of teens are now in gang and more dangerouse. There also plenty of riots going on today. Anyway ""Fast Times"" is da bomb!"
3,Philippe Martine: Spicoli!!!!What a mervallous man !!!,"Wowe!!! What a movie!The idea of a drugged in the movie was mervallous, but the idea of the life of little mongols in a city don't make me happy. Spicoli, a sozi of me .(If we talk about drug)...His mervallous stock of pipe water, pipe, paper... What a beautiful man! He's everytime buzzed at the school and he said to his teacher ""Hey Dude"".His teacher was a little nurds who think that everybody was buzzed. I think that the movie is like today. Sex, drugs, a beautiful world. In conclusion, this movie requered a best scenario but SPICOLI up my rate of stars."
4,Classic 80's Film,"While not the best produced film it maintains a semi-cult following none the less. This film is a guilty pleasure taking you back in time when high school was ""high"" and hanging out at the mall was fun. Lost innocence seems to be a reoccurring theme and there are several scenes that illustrate this well. In a nutshell, this movie is about a bunch of sex starved teenagers doing what teenagers do in their natural habitat. Enjoy!"
5,"""Awesome, Totally Awesome!""","I think the character of Spicoli popularized the exclamatory catch-phrase: Awesome! High school grommets of today probably have no clue where this term originally gained it's traction. Spicoli was a great character, but for my money the real star of the movie is Brad Hamilton played by Judge Reinhold. The scene where Brad fantasizes about his sisters girlfriend is an all time classic hooter. This movie catches the mall-rat mentality of the early 80's perfectly. This is the flick that spawned a whole new genre and launched alot of great acting careers. Watch this movie and you will laugh loudly."
3,Boring but sometimes funny.,I saw this movie with my english teacher. I think that this movie is very boring but some characters of the movie make it funny. The rating that I give is medium because the story is so fast that sometimes it's hard to fallow the story. My favorite character is Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) because his stupidity makes his very funny. I think that the society in our times is more violent.The school in Fast Times seens less dangerous than today's school. Its a funny and divertising film. I recommend it for persons who loves comedy movies.
