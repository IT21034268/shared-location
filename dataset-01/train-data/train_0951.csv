1,Half of all discs came scratched!,"It is insulting what PARAMOUNT has done in regards to the cases the discs come in. They put the 5 dollar dvd's at gas stations in better quality cases then these (LITERALLY 100%) I feel so ripped off because half my Next Generation episodes cannot be watched due to poor quality casing. The discs came with scratches and fall out every time you try to flip through them. Some were all ready out of place when opened for the first time!; Im just amazed at how terrible Paramount is with quality...... Im pissed off dont by the complete series, they might not even play when you pop em in the DVD player and you will experience extreme frustration thinking about all the money you just waisted. Paramount - TREAT YOUR BUYERS WITH SOME RESPECT!"
1,Disc Problems,"I was so excited when I ordered this, couldn't wait to get it. I watched Season 1, then almost all of Season 2. My disc player couldn't read the last disc. I received the replacement and had a problem with jumping images on season 1 even thought the disc was clean. I checked the disc, cleaned my player and tried again. Same problem. Amazon refunded my money promptly. In reading the reviews I noticed someone else had problems with their original purchase and their replacement. Apparently, Paramount has either a problem with quality control, or no quality control at all. I also agree that the packaging is shoddy (holding the disc holders together with tape--what's up with that?) I would strongly advise against purchasing this item until Paramount fixes their disc issues. And I hope Amazon notifies everyone who was forced to get refunds due to Paramount's incompetance when this issue is resolved."
3,More on STTNG Case,"THE FIRST THING I WAS FORCED TO DO WAS REMOVE THE DVDs TO 8 CASES (1 EA SEASON THAT HOLD UP TO 8 DVDS ea)...REAL CASES, THE TYPE WHERE IF U SPILL PEPSI ON ONE, ONLY NEED IS REPLACE CASE not LOSS of DVDS..the only worse collction series case was 11 season MASH...not even hubs! jusst slits in a cardboard causing damage right from factory. just becase these co's have a monopoly on whocan sell the copyrighted content..doesnt mean THIS disgustion mess..BTW aside from almost no extras Quality of viseo on the DVDs IS excellent..should be considering there isnt a more expensive 7 season series anywhere."
2,Just What I Didn't Want,"Go ahead and order them if you must, but the transfer to DVD is terrible. To get all the episodes on as few disks as possible, they either compressed them too much or just didn't take care in doing a quality job. I can't watch them in full screen mode without horrendous artifacts. So I have to reduce screen size to make it look as good as it did on television. I shouldn't have to do that."
1,Cheap Packaging,"Reader, I GOT VERY lucky and found this on eBay brand new for $129. I can't believe this cheap piece of dung is normally sold at $450+. The packaging is so bad I'll have to spend more money just so I have a GOOD WAY to protect my disks.1) First this thing has a plastic base that has one of those flimsy clear covers to go over it.2) Clear flimsy cover (as said above).3) The disks are in a cheap like plastic holder like you would find in packaging to hold headphones in until you open it and throw it away. Even better description would be that kind of cheap plastic found in marshmallow candies that is holding the candy.4) The above DVD holders are then TAPED together (8 total) which acts as the hing.I'm going to have to buy and/or find at least 7 DVD cases that can hold 6 DVDs (6 disks per season) just to keep the disks from getting all busted in the cheap packaging."
4,Star Trek: The Next Generaton - Complete Series,"The price was great, compared to some of the others (for the complete series). Packaging was good also. Although not enhanced, the picture and sound quality were good (identical to when the series was actually being aired) - overall very pleased with the product and would recommend this provider in the future."
1,Do not buy the green set - half the discs do not play,"I spent a few hundred dollars on this set and it says on the packaging items it contains .. and it does not ... the disc have cheap plastic to supposedly protect them in shipping but half of them don't play. Then, if you get them to actually play on some systems they play one day and not the next. I tried 3 differnt systems before I now finally broke down and bought a second copy. Don't buy the green set.These are inferior copies and while they may show a logo I do not believe them to be real. If they are real, paramount owes me several hundred dollars and or a new set of discs in return.DO NOT BUY THIS .. you will be disappointed."
3,"ST:TNG Good, but not the best anthology","I love the show very much and consider myself a Trek fan. It's nice to have the series on DVD, but the extra features are nill if any. Very sporadic, no real commentary or commentary that is particularly interesting. If you want your favorite episodes on DVD, you get it. The video quality is not particularly good, it's pretty average. I think it was a straight transfer from VHS, but I could be wrong. It would be nice to get director commentaries, but I don't think there are any. Slightly disappointing considering how much money I blew on the discs, in my opinion."
1,WARNING - THIS PRODUCT IS A PIRATED BOOTLEG,"I encourage everyone to read the comments to the top rated review by Thomas Cannold where you will find plenty of evidence that this product is a copied bootleg. In addition to what you read there (shoddy packaging, size of DVDs are only 4.5 GB and not the standard 7 GB), I can confirm there are plenty of spelling errors on the disks with the episode titles. For example, Season 1 Disk 3 reads ""Hide And O"" (instead of ""Hide And Q"") and ""The Big Boodbyb"".Obvious pirated software. Do not buy."
1,Star Trek from goHastings,I purchased this from goHastings through amazon and it arrived with the case completely smashed up secondary to poor packaging. When I called to see what could be done they offered me a refund on the shipping which was $2. Not the most satisfying resolution. Would have just appreciated the thing be packaged in an appropriate sized box so it wasn't banged up in transit. The case was so smashed up I just tossed it because it was shattered in multiple pieces.
3,Star Trek TNG,Excellent series to own however this set does not store the disc's well because the plastic pieces break easily....recommend that if you purchase this version that you be prepared to find a better storage method for the disc's.....this set looks good but does not store the disc's well at all. The 7 box set(one box per season) is far superior for storage but cost wise it cost's much more to get the complete series that way and no matter which way you purchase you get the same thing. I give the series 5 stars its the poor quality of this set that gets 3 stars
3,Terrible Case and disc containers,"This is a great show and I will enjoy every disc but the case containing each disc is by far the WORSE containers I have ever seen. They are just junk. Held together by clear tape the disc started to fall apart as soon as I opened the package. Through the entire batch of disc cases in the trash and went and bought a zip up case that holds over 80 disc and at least now the disc do not fall apart. Oh and one more thing, no documention of the shows on the disc or booklet of any kind. If I had known the poor quality of this product I would not have bought. Also some the shows are of poor quality and some disc do not work on a Blue Ray Player."
3,"Great show, terrible packaging","As others have said, the discs come in cheap trays that prone to breaking (several of them were broken when I received the set) and the trays are held together by nothing more than packing tape which the trays have a tendency to separate from. For the price of a brand new set, one would think the spartan packaging could have been upgraded.But, the series is great and anyone looking to buy this set already knows that."
3,The Next Generation...,"If you just want to watch the series this is perfect for you. It has all 7 seasons in one fairly small container, plus bonus material. My only complaint is that the packaging is fragile and a lot of the casing came broken in the mail. It doesn't effect how the DVDs play though. It's just a bummer that there are all these little plastic pieces everywhere.The other thing is that the DVDs haven't been altered at all, so the film quality is the same as it once back in the late 80s / early 90s. It can take some getting use to.The series is of course excellent, and watching the whole through is a must for fans of every variety. Plus there is bonus material on the last disc of each season."
4,Star Trek TNG,Star Trek the Next Generation makes good sense for science fiction fans who want hours and hours of top quality sci-fi fun. This collection can be enjoyed again and again.
1,The Next Generation with a not-so Next generation quality,"We were really bouyed with our last purchase of the Star Trek, TOS, but the Next generation packaging has totally let us down. Displeasure clearly emanates from following reasons1) Disc seperators of very poor quality and starts breaking even if you try to open to retrieve the DVD, in fact some of them had gaping holes immediately after opening the package2) Picture quality higly mediocre and hazy, gives impression of a shoddy job of DVD conversion3) some discs have starting trouble and they stop at some places4) Sound quality averageOverall package is dissappointing and clearly not worth the premium that is charged,"
2,poor quality,The picture quality is very poor.Ive been watching it on my Sony Bravia 1080p 120hz lcd tv with my bluray player and it looks like im watching it on pre digital tv when STNG first came out in 1987. The dvd holders are made of very very cheap plastic and are held together with packaging tape. the only saving grace that rates the 2ND star is that i love this series and i can get the entire 7 seasons in 1 package.
2,Star Trek The Next Generation complete series,Set is poor quality and now with Amazon Prime I get the full series and all years of all the Star Trek productions. I am not plugging Amazon prime but for about $6.50 a month I can watch everything I liked about Star Trek NG without a huge outlay of cash. Well worth the subscription to A Prime.
3,discs in poor condition,Several discs in season 1 have had extended areas where the picture freezes. No large scratches are visible however. Have not made it past season 1 yet.
1,BOOTLEG,I just ordered this dvd set for my husband who has wanted it for a very long time. We noticed that is did not come with the poster it says it comes with. I also read the warning review that says if you don't get the poster you probably got a bootleg. I'm a little pissed that I spent this kind of money on a bootleg!!
3,Great series... horrible set,"I think the review by Thomas Cannold covered it very well.In general, it's a great series, and I enjoyed watching it all the way through again.However... the packaging was done in an insanely cheap manner, and the MSRP seems to suggest that they think this should sell more for similar sized sets, that are packaged and delivered in a much better way. It is almost like they are saying to their fans ""You are really worthless trash who's only purpose is to give us lots money for our scraps.""Honestly, at half the price I got it, or about 1/5th of the MSRP show on Amazon, it would probably be worth it."
1,bad deal only part play,I love star trek ng.theres something wrong with the dvds that i got.the price was good.the shipping fine.the product is defective.
5,THE NEXT GENERATION,"All in all, what you are getting when you buy these DVDs is all the seasons in this series. Every season contained at least one classic episode. The characters are terrific, and helped to redefine the very notion of what we come to expect from characters in the STAR TREK UNIVERSE."
5,Outstanding,"I can't stop watching them. I loved it the show when it was on on 20 years ago, and I love them more now!!"
1,DVDs not received but paid for,"The person I ordered these DVDs from notified me they were out of them. They told me to contact Amazon for a refund; Amazon told me to contact the seller; the seller said they had not been paid and checked with Amazon only to find they were holding the money. The seller has been in constant contact with me in trying to resolve this issue. Since Amazon took the money from my credit card account before the DVDs were shipped and I have not received a response from them, I contacted my credit card company who is working on this."
1,have not received,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS YET!!!!!! IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED BY 12/30/2010!!!!I HAVE SENT TWO E-MAILS AND STILL HAVE NOT GOTTEN A REPLY AND HERE IT IS 1/08/2011
1,wish i had recieved it,I ordered this on feb 24 they took my money on feb 25 its now march 27 and I still have not gotten my order. So here's my review order at your own risk.
4,How I solved the packaging problem,"While this is a 5 star show, I agree that the packaging of this set is cheap and leaves a lot to be desired for the price. Taking a tip from another reviewer, I found a great dvd case at walmart for this set. Its a 48 capacity disk box by Vault for about $20. It is a hard case, not just a soft wallet style. All 48 disks fit well with two extra pockets for the special features disk and the paper foldout that comes with this DVD set.Just thought the info might help someone."
2,Cheap Plastic Case,"The show is great and deserves 5 stars, but this set they've put together is only worth 2. This set comes with the discs set into double sided plastic trays that are cheap and fragile. They are taped together with packing tape in three packs. Mine came cracked, but I didn't return it because the discs are okay. I'll probably end up transferring the discs to a higher quality case. I bought this set because it was on sale. It would have been better had they used a higher quality plastic for the case."
3,"Great product, crappy package","I love this star trek series, but the package it came in was badly made and the bright green plastic case had a broken piece. I wish they could have made this package as well as they did for the DS9 series."
3,star trek,i love the series and love the video quality but i did not like the bad plastics it came in it all fell apart the first time i opened it and it is a pain to take the cds out of the box. the quality of the cd trays is also bad some of the cd restraints are broken so the cds keep falling out. overall not happy with the packaging
3,Star Trek: TNG Complete Series,"The discs and quality of the shows are fine. The condition I got the packaging in was another story. The UPS shippment was fine. The damage was done prior to it even being shipped. It was extremely dirty and all of the green disc holders were either cracked or broken, the outter slip that goes over the green holders and under the shrink wrap is so scratched it looks like it was kicked around on the warehouse floor.... I won't be purchasing another expensive collectors disc set through amazon...."
3,"Great product, but sucky packaging","I ordered this series so I could further complete my Star Trek collection. I love it. My only complaint, and it's a major one, is the packaging! Come on now! We Star Trek fans shell out big bucks for these things. The least CBS could do is use better packaging. That being said, I like the way discs are accessed. It's easy to hold it in one hand while standing in front of your DVD player to look for a specific episode. Also, it does save quite a bit of space when compared to the way other complete series are packaged. Perhaps we'll see an improvement in this area when entire Star Trek series are released in HD."
1,No thanks!,"Packaging is even cheaper than the Voyager plastic that breaks easy. $300?? No thanks, should be $149-179. I was hoping to replace my VHS episodes, but at $300 I can get up to switch tapes."
3,Great series - cheap product!,STNG is a great series but the quality of this set leaves MUCH to be desired. Cheap flimsy cases held together with tape stuck in a flimsy plastic box with a paper insert that comes off as soon as the plastic wrap is removed. Nothing at all like the quality packaging of all the other ST collections. I haven't had the chance to play the disk yet but I'm hoping I don't have the quality issues with the disks that many others are apparently having. I should have paid the extra for the individual season sets.
3,Star Trek TNG DVD series,"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete SeriesI ordered these through Amazon and was assured they were the legit Paramount product. They arrived today and were Express Mailed from CHINA. The package had ""China Post"" all over it and had US Customs documentation with it stating it was a ""Gift"" and no taxes paid. The green trays use packaging tape as a hinge to hold the trays together like a book and each DVD is in a little plastic bag. The packaging looks real, as do the disks, including logos for Paramount and CBS DVD, and copyrights. I am confused. How do you tell for sure if these are bootleg orcounterfeit?"
2,defective disks,I purchased the Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series and am disappointed. There are disks that do not play at all. Not quite the complete series I guess.
2,Love Star Trek - suprised by packaging,I am an avid Star Trek fan and love The Next Generation Series. I was suprised when the package come in the US mail from China. I was also suprised with the packaging was different than the 'usual' packaging of my other Star Trek Series DVDs. I have not yet watched all of the discs but the first one does have a flaw in the picture. the disc gets stuck on a segment and then skips to another chapter. The next disc worked fine. I would not recommend buying from this supplier again.
4,Star-trek-watcher,order filled right away a couple of problems in a couple of shows.Have not watched all 40 dvd's yet
1,Twenty minutes of reading to find out that the product is not worth buying,"I am happy to see that Amazon includes customer reviews, but I do believe that the company bears a certain responsibility for the products it offers for sale. Rather than waste my time reading reviews for a product that is not worth buying, I would prefer that Amazon exercise some judgment and not offer such a product for sale. This is akin to a grocery store offering spoiled food for sale; it just is not right.Perhaps an entry next to the product's name saying, ""This product has been removed because of numerous unfavorable reviews and our own observations."""
1,Review of Purchase from Amazon.com,"I must say that, based on my experience with this order, I will never again use Amazon.com. When the order did not arrive within the specified amount of time, I tried to contact the seller, Kingdvdseller, according to Amazon's protocol for complaints. I got no response. I then notified Amazon and submitted their on-line form for my complaint ... still no response.At this time, I am simply out over $200 and have nothing to show for it. Buyers, beware."
3,"For best looks, don't open","This thing looks great, until you open it. The green plastic that holds the disks comes apart in my hands, the disks themselves came shuffled around, and there is no guide beyond the episode listings on the disks for what is what. However, if you're looking for a cheap grouping of all that TNG you've been wanting forever, and this comes up for more than half-off like last Black Friday, there's nothing wrong with grabbing it."
2,Middle Finger to Fans,"I will be brief, because many others have described at length the flaws of this particular set. It appalls me that a product as poor as this can be successfully produced and sold in a capitalist society. The hacks at Paramount have obviously outsourced the production of these dvds to China or a similar place. Low quality discs, low quality packaging. You get what you pay for, I guess. I would strongly recommend that Star Trek fans invest in the individual seasons instead. This set is not worth anywhere near what it costs, and is an insult to the legacy of TNG."
3,"5-star series, 1-star packaging...averages out to a 3-star product?","If you're pondering ordering the complete series of Star Trek: The Next Generation, then you obviously know what the premise of the show is so let's go to the packaging. The DVDs are placed into unlabeled trays which hold either one DVD or two DVDs (front & back). These trays are unlabeled, divided into three groups rather than the seven seasons, and are held together by what appears to be a clear strip of packaging tape. These three groups of trays are placed in a silver tray which is adequately sturdy. The clear plastic cover that drops down over the trays, however, is far from sturdy. The lid is reminiscent of the clear plastic one would find in disposable packaging. Needless to say, the packaging left much to be desired."
1,Product Quality and Supplier Responsiveness,"DVD set had high rate of defective disc which prevented viewing. The Supplier's source for this DVD set was from China. The Supplier was responsive to first report of three defective discs. However, my second report of another seven defective discs was totally ignored. I do not recommned purchasing this particular disc set not do I recommend a purchase from this seller."
3,Star Trek TNG 20th Anniversary,"The discs are labeled poorly, the text being tiny, almost unreadable. Also, there are errors on a select few discs where the show titles are wrong. For instance, there are two ""Cause and Effects"" on separate discs. Obviously a factory screwup.The quality is somewhat grainy. Quite noticable on a larger screen.The plastic disc containers are cheap and mine were even broken.All in all, a very nice set. But you're paying for the discs only. The disc holders are pathetic and the poor labeling make the set an overall disappointing package.I paid $280 for my set and in my opinion, it wasn't worth that much to me."
2,Worth the price? Maybe not.,"I recently got Season 1 of TNG as a gift and wanted to just go ahead and complete the collection.So I came here and behold! The entire collection in 1 go! Fantastic. Then I checked out how much it would be if I just got the 6 seasons I am missing.It turns out that I would end up paying nearly $90 more for this BOX versus the Season box sets 1 by 1. Buying seasons 2-7 only amounted to about $220 at a price between $36-37.99. (Seasons 1-7 would run you $259.93 before any shipping costs, roughly saving you $60.)Seems to me that the price of this thing with it's sub-standard packaging would aim to be LESS of a cost, rather than more.Anyhow, I ended up going with the single season box sets and am perfectly happy with them, and the $90 or so I saved by doing so.I hope this helps someone out in a similar situation."
1,Some Discs are Unplayable due to Copy Protection,"These DVD's are copy protected and some discs simply will not play in a computer at all. Not with real DVD software like PowerDVD, not with VLC, and not with mplayer. You can't even rip the content to watch it after it is ripped (and I tried everything -- even a raw sector dump with ddrescue).This product is garbage and a rip off. I can't even watch what I legally purchased! That's $300 I could have spent on beer!"
1,Defective merchandise,"The STNG series we purchased took 3 weeks to arrive, and came from China, after ordering it from Bratley13 (Brad Gross). It was manufactured in the People's Republic of China with Mandarin shipping labels. The first disk was OK, but the next 5 CDs had defects severe enough that several episodes had glitches, and at least 1 episode on each disk was totally unreadable. We returned the merchandise, but the seller has yet to make good on his offer of replacement. We are still waiting as of 3 1/2 months."
5,Not a review,"Just wondering and maybe some of you can email these video companies as to who came up with this LARGE case for DVDs. The disk is the same as a CD yet they use all this extra plastic, why not in jewel cases. Now to cut costs they are making cases thinner and cutting out this recycle symbol. If they use jewel cases there is less plastic, not to mention they could use the same cover art as the soundtrack that is in a jewel case. Most look the same as the DVD. Another point is if you look at storage units, they hold 3 or 4 times as many CDs as they do DVDs. 2 DVDs are bigger than 1 VHS tape. Anyone else but me wonder about this???"
4,ST:TNG Series review,"This is a great series for the kids- generally not too intense (although the Borg freak out one of mine), appropriate language, entertaining and with some interesting themes for family discussion. My only gripe was the packaging on this set, which is awkward and difficult to navigate and manage."
3,Highly enjoyable but...,"Well, being a huge Star Trek fan, it goes without saying that I would enjoy the collection. The only thing missing is an episode guide. Something that had the Episode title with a brief discription would have been helpful."
2,Show is great but my package came broken!!!,"I like the show, no problems there. I was so upset though because when my boyfriend opened the box all of the cases holding the dvds were broken and/or chipped. Thank God it was a gift for my boyfriend because I would have been very embarassed giving a bunch of dvds in broken cases to someone else. not only did my order take a week longer than it was supposed to (because it was lost in the mail) it was not handled with care. You would think that something that costs hundreds of dollars would be taken care of properly."
1,Very poor quality,"As many others have observed, the packaging is VERY cheap. Parts of the plastic trays were broken in shipping. They will NOT hold up over time, being too fragile even for normal use.The package contained two duplicate disks for one season while missing another disk. The disks themselves seem to be of poor quality, with several being either unplayable, or problematic.Overall, poor quality in both media production and packaging."
3,some discs don't work properly,some of the discs seem not to work as they should.I found that the picture in some of the discs keeps on bouncing and showing squares.at a closer look at the disk it seems there are marks that show the manufacture procedures was not preformed properly.I would suggest Amazon looks into this before continuing selling this product.
5,"Beautiful, beautiful violins","I've discovered, so to speak, a lot of the music I ultimately love by hearing it played during movies. Sometimes it's a diverse sampling of many artists. Sometimes all the songs are written by one man and played by an orchestra. THE VILLAGE, of course, is the latter, a musical masterpiece that is absolutely amazing, with just a couple of offerings that make you wish you were watching the movie so you could really appreciate them. I've been playing this CD in my car for weeks, and I'm still not tired of it."
4,*No Words*,"The Village was a movie battered by film critics and the audience alike. It stands to me as a film I will always respect due to disquieting effect.The Village Score is no less any different. The music is like one walk through a forgotten land and time that I would like to take. I'd do that more than once. It draws attention due its complex melody.I fail to put in words the quite unearthly effect it holds. I was never a big fan of Scores and instrumental music until I heard this particular piece of music. James Newton Howard shines in this respect worthy glitter of astonishing proportions.(If you like what you hear, I recommend the score of the movie Road To Perdition which again is something exquisite for your ears)"
5,"The score to ""The Village"" is excellent!","The score to ""The Village"" is excellent! All of the songs on here are excellent! This is one of James Newton Howard's best scores. I have the scores to both ""Signs"" & ""Unbreakable"", this is a little bit better than those two. There are 13 songs on here. The titles of those 13 tracks are: Noah Visits, What Are You Asking Me?, The Bad Color, Those We Don't Speak Of, Will You Help Me?, I Cannot See His Color, Rituals, The Gravel Road, Race To Resting Rock, The Forbidden Line, The Vote, It Is Not Real, & The Shed Not To Be Used. An well made score and an well made emotional, thought-out, characterization of the movie itself."
4,Gorgeously Haunting,"Having finally seen this movie, I was immediately ""taken in"" by the superb score by James Newton Howard, of course, M.Night'schosen composer for all of his films. Simply view the ""SpecialFeatures"" section on the DVD, and watch and listen to the comments concerning the ""scoring"" of The Village. Both Howard andShyamalan explain their thought processes.In addition, I've always been a Hilary Hahn fan since she madeher debut in classical music. Her violin solo and ensemble on this disc are mesmorizing. As Mr. Howard states, ""she has abeautiful touch and lyrical quality to her tone that is uniquelyhers""....I personally believe she's one of the most gifted players currently out there.Mr. Howard also shapes a very tense and disturbing sound forthe ""frightening"" scenes in the film. Overall....the score's fitfor the movie are like hand-in-glove. An excellent listen."
5,Delicate Brilliance,"James Newton Howard has done it again. After his brilliant and horriffic score for Signs, he moved on to The Village.It is a mixture of his other thriller scores, with a lot of haunting solo violin. It brings back the movie in a vivid and amazing way.A must have for anyone who likes score music."
4,Beautiful violin playing by Hilary Hahn,"Hilary Hahn was an ideal choice for this exquisite and sensitive theme music by James Newton Howard for the unusual sci fi film: ""The Village"" by director M. Night Shyalaman. Her violin playing is beyond her years in its maturity. I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to it in my car, on my computer and on my hi fi system. I shall be looking out for similar peices by James Newton Howard and Hilary Hahn. Wonderful!"
3,"Well-played, haunting, but not completely convincing","This one will probably appeal most to die-hard fans of Hilary Hahn (of which I am one), whose performance here is the standout ingredient. The composition starts out haunting and original, but then it seems to lose its way among the requirements of the film. I enjoyed only the first 30 minutes or so. Hilary Hahn has the Midas touch and can turn just about anything into gold, but for most listeners, even Ms. Hahn's legendary perfection on the finger board may not be enough to overcome what is missing here. Were she featured more prominently, this would be a better recording."
3,"Nice...but a little overrated,","I'm a sucker for film scores. I can't get enough of em'. I've listened to a lot, and based on the reviews James N. Howard's score was getting for ""The Village"", I decided to buy it.I have mixed feelings--the music is definitely very pretty, very soothing (or agressive when needed), but I never really felt like I was listening to anything but just 'another' score here. There really isn't anything especially beautiful or stand-out, and I have heard orchestral scores from independent films (see 2002's ""Stranded"", a low-budget sci-fi film made for only about four million clams that boasts one of the most gorgeous scores you will ever hear)that are more memorable and evocative.This, I hate to say it, just kinda felt ""blah"" to me.Not bad.Just...kinda...""Blah""."
5,Haunting,"This is a beautiful and haunting album. It feels like it never ends. I sends chills down your spine. I thought this was just amazing. A little repetative, but amazing still. I give it five stars!"
4,Those We Don't Speak Of,"""The Village"" soundtrack is a really beautiful score CD by composer James Newton Howard. The best score on this cd is ""Those We Don't Speak Of"". It is very creepy and sets the tone for the film. The score is very different than his other work on M. Night's film ""Signs"", because ""The Village"" score is more haunting and slow. James Newton Howard captures the isolation, loneliness, and terror of the villagers in this movie perfectly. I highly recommend this cd."
5,FANTASTIC,Another fantastic score from JNH. The violin is haunting. The themes are haunting. A true work of art.
4,Good Buy,Very satisfied with purchase price and item description was accurate except that it stated product was made of metal but was actually aluminum. Delivery was as promised.

5,"A great read, unable to put down.","This was a surprise read for me, but I enjoyed it! It was written so well, I felt the need to wear a sweater while reading it."
2,Helps a little but their MIMO sucks.,I tried to use this in a difficult location for signal. It didn't help really. Their MIMO doesn't seem to make any difference. I had tried it a few years ago and got same results but I thought by now they would have improved it...NO still not any good.
5,No Problem Here,"D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter, has worked flawlessly with my Vista, and it is 64 bit. I had no problem setting it up and it has been flawless.BUT You need to read the directions and follow them to the letter, no short cuts. Luckly I did it by the numbers, I am someone that does take shortcuts and end up havcing to do thing over and over. But this time I decided to read the directions and follow them even.It has been since Christmas time and I have been very happy with it. I have set up my wifes laptop also, and we are both surfing away on our own computers at the same time and there has been no problems at all.I do not understadn why there are so many 1 ratings. If this is a one I would be very happy to try one of the higher rated ones, I can not even begin to think how well they must work....."
1,Couldn't get it to work!,The installation process didn't work as described in the manual (I use Win2000) and the connection to the access point was only very occasional (there were within inches of each other) so I gave up on this adapter after hours of frustration. Customer service spoke English well but was without a clue.
1,"Easy to setup and use, but overheats and slows","Really loved the look and connection speed of this attractive puppy-- a whopping 150 - 300 Mbps, after all of three minutes of setup and connection time. Sadly, after a few weeks running it, it bgean to overheat, and the connection would slow or drop altogether. For example, my 18-20Mbps connection to Comcast dropped to less than 6Mbps last night, and was so intermittent that easy-to-access webpages like [...] were timing out, while my other machine stayed pinned at 20.DLink said I must return it for a new one. I hope the same doesn't occur..."
2,"It works okay, but...","I recently purchased the DWA-130 and a D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router together. When the DWA-130 didn't work out of the box, I downloaded the newest drivers. Now it works, but not nearly as well as I had expected. The biggest disappointment is that although the DWA-130 reports that it's attached to the router at 130 MBPS, the effective transfer speed to the network-attached storage box that's plugged into an Ethernet port on the DIR-655 is somewhat slower than it was using the 56 MBPS wireless-G router and adapter that this replaces."
1,Do not purchase for Windows 7 and desktop,D-Link Product Support could not determine why the adapter works in my laptop with Windows XP (which I did not purchase it for my laptop) and will not install on my desktop with Windows 7.
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Excellent product, using it for my desk top which is far from the modem. It is running at 270. The installation was done in 5 minutes.I would recommend this to a friend!!"
2,Unsupported Garbage,This product works very poorly with Windows 7 and even Vista. Seems to be ok with XP but this is 2011 and time to get on the ball.You will lose your connection to the access point and yet the device thinks its still connected. You will wait 5 minutes after boot for it bother to try reconnecting after a hibernate or shutdown. These were the issues I was seeing on OSes Vista and newer. Why they haven't bothered to fix the drivers is beyond me. I guess that is why these are at a fire sale price.Save your money and more importantly - your time.
1,Short life span,"Seems great when you first install, but not very reliable. Purchased this about a year ago. Had problems with losing the internet connection, and the problem has gotten worse. An internet search turned up many other users with the problem; apparently what's happening is that the adapter heats up and then shuts down. In the last three or four months, this has happened almost every time I'm on the internet for more than 30 minutes or so. I know it's this adapter, because when I lose the internet on the machine using the D-Link 130, I check my internet connection on other devices, and it's always fine. I would not purchase this again."
4,works well for now. Will see,"Not sure if its an issue with d-link but it seems to take longer to aquire a wireless signal than linksys. However, stear clear of the liksys. Junk, junk, junk. I've been working with computers for 10 years and so far D-link has there stuff together."
1,Not a good wireless device,"This is a mediocre product and I suspect it has compatibility issues with other vendors' wireless products.A) It has trouble maintaining connections, while another vendor's products on the same laptop and PC do not.B) The speed of the connection may start as high as 144 Mbps before dropping to 11 Mbps or lower within one minute on those connections it does struggle to keep open.C) It's terrible on streaming media, even from a server on the same LAN. Media is choppy and often stops for buffering.D) Once the connection drops, it's frustrating to have to go through the whole process reconnecting and logging in.I bought a replacement product from another vendor, and I'm a lot happier."
1,Disconnects repeatedly after 6 months.,"I have the revised C version.Through some heavy usage over the past half year, it has now begun to disconnect constantly under heavy download rates. Streaming video content such as YouTube only works for a few minutes until disconnecting.I've tried reinstalling the driver with no avail.It seems like that adapter has reached its turning point.Really disappointing.My streaming and downloading gets cut short every time and I have to end up redownloading or reloading the page to get it back working again.However under regular web browsing, it works fine.Extremely frustrating.Look elsewhere.I DO NOT recommend this product."
1,Do NOT purchase if usinf Windows XP SP3,"I purchased this product and spent multiple hours trouble shooting why it wasn't working. After being cut-off after 15-minutes of worthless trouble-shooting with a technician on D-Links less-than helpful service lines, I dialed back in I was told by the next person that they do not support Windows XP SP3 and I was out of luck. No option but to set my PC back to SP2.I rate the product a zero, and couldn't be more disappointed in this purchase. I also purchased the DIR-655 router, and wish I would have stuck with Linksys for both products.Scott"
2,Beware: not for 64-bit Vista,the ad and product details include Vista - not 32-bit Vista only. Big surprise! bad surprise!
3,"Bad Customer Service, Good Product, (DOES NOT WORK ON x64 bit OPERATING SYSTEMS)","I bought this device hoping to get Wi-Fi Connectivity, to my upstairs room. I recieved the product 1 day late, but when I got it took it out of the box. I tried installing it but the disk would not run! untill I used Administrator account. Then I installed it and The Software Didn't even detect the Adapter! Then after an hour, I called Customer service and Tech Support, but They were Clueless! They just told me to buy a new one and return this one WHICH I bought on amazon. Just to let you know, they the drivers, are not Compatible with x64 bit Windows XP Pro Edition, and x64 Bit Vista! Other wise I used on a laptop and it works great! Better reception too!"
5,The DWA-130 Solved My Networking Issues!,"I couldn't be happier with this little USB adaptor. It was a breeze to set up and works better than I'd expected (especially compared to the Linksys WUSB54GSC it replaced).Initially I connected this to my a Linksys WRT54GX4 802.11g access point. Though positioned identically to the my original Linksys USB wireless adaptor, the D-Link DWA-130 often reported 100% singnal strength and data transfer rates were almost always right at 54Mbs. This where the Linksys adaptor had conectivity issues and often reported speeds of 1 to 5.5Mbs.I recently upgraded the access point to a D-Link DIR-655. Once again, a breeze and now (for about what I spent on the Linksys components) I've gone from sub-10Mbs connecton speeds to speeds typically between 117Mbs and 130Mbs! This was the best $182 I've spent in awhile!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought this adapter (Rev. B1) because I wanted to upgrade my Dell 1520 Notebook (Vista Ultimate 32 bit) from Wireless G to Wireless N. Installation was simple and only took a few minutes. I discarded the CD and loaded the most recent firmware from D-Links site. I then was prompted to insert the adapter into a USB port. After a couple of minutes, I was prompted to enter my SSID and Password. Bingo. Now I get a consistent 270 Mbps, with a good signal.D-Link would like you to think that you only get the fastest wireless speeds if you use this adapter with one of their Routers. But I found that this adapter works great with my Netgear WNR2000 Router.Make sure you get the Rev. B1 model or C1 model (not Rev. A1)"
3,Good but has one problem.....,"I have had no drop outs and the speed is very good. However, this thing burns like the sun. Who woulda thought a USB device could get this hot."
4,Works Great,I originally bought the cheapest wireless adapter I could find on amazon and found the software was difficult to upload and my connection was always SUPER slow. Now that I have the D-Link adapter my internet connection appears to be significantly faster. I'm very happy.
4,D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter,"Product works very well after I had all the Webroot anti-virus software uninstalled. Haven't figured out why this software causes problems on my desktop (and not my laptop), but it does. Anyway, I'm satisfied with the adapter.D-Link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter"
3,Works well unless I reboot,"The adapter works well once connected, has good speed and is relatively easy to use. My only complaint is that everytime I restart my computer I have to either ""repair my connection"" or reenter my network password to get the adapter to make its initial connection to the router. This isn't a big deal but it is certainly annoying as I find myself waiting for a good two to three minutes during reboot just for the adapter.My computer runs well and has no issues. I am running a new D-Link DIR-655 router which seemingly should connect well to a D-Link adapter, but as of now I have no clue why the adapter always has that initial startup problem.Nonetheless if your looking for a cheap adapter and don't care about some initial startup hassle, I would recommend this adapter."
1,It's like a virus!,"It worked very well the first time it was installed. Nice range, nice speed, etc... But that was short lived!From the second time I turned on the computer the computer, every time I tried to plug it in it sent my computer crashing to a blue screen and a reboot. I invested hours of research and time on the phone with D-Link customer support to no avail. It crashes my computer every time I plug it in. New drivers didn't help, re-installing old drivers didn't help. It's just an immediate trip to bluescreen death! The worst thing of it all is that I can't even remove some of the old software that infected my computer along with it.Please do yourself a favor and avoid D-link products."
2,Easy to Install but very poor range,"I purchased a D-Link DIR-625 Range Booster Wireless N Router several months ago to increase the range with my Dell Vostro 1500 laptop. I'm using it in a wood frame home where the router is in the basement (centrally located, against the ceiling) and my laptop is very often on the second floor near an outside wall. I purchased the DWA-130 to increase the signal strength over the Dell's internal G adapter.The good: The install was simple and easy. I got the new adapter up and running in under 10 minutes with no problems.The bad: The signal strength was worse than my internal G adapter.This is very frustrating because I'm within 25' of the router anywhere in my home and unless I'm on the 1st floor or basement, the signal is terrible. I'm looking into exchanging the DWA-130 for a DWA-140 Range Booster N adapter hoping that it will increase the signal strength matched with my DIR-625."
1,Not worth the effort,"First off, I will say if you have a D-Link router then *maybe* this adapter works, I don't know. I have a Linksys wireless-N Gigabit router and was trying to find a cheaper alternative to Linksys's adapters. The DWA-130 performed poorly not only on an XP machine, but also a Vista machine. It connected great at first, then began intermittently disconnecting after that and would refuse to reconnect without a reboot. When I called D-Link about it, the tech told me their adapters don't work very well with any Vista except Vista Basic. If that is true, this is a worse product than I first thought. Got a Linksys adapter and it works perfectly. So if you're going to buy this adapter, your only chances of success are 1) maybe if you have a D-Link router, or 2) maybe if you're running the cheapest version of Vista. Honestly, you're better off paying a little more and going with Linksys all around."
1,Problems connecting with my computer.,"Reasons why I think this product stinks:(1) I couldn't connect to the Internet although I tried troubleshooting with three different technical support reps.(2) I returned the item because the technical support rep. said that the item was defective so I got a new one and still couldn't connect even after taking another hour talking to a rep.(3) The technical support reps had different answers each time I spoke with one.(4) Very difficult communicating with the reps since English probably isn't their first language.I'm not sure if anyone else has the same experience as I did and it might just be unique to my case, but I just wanted to share with you my experience if it is of any help. I've bought a D-link router a few months and it worked just fine so I'm surprised that I had trouble connecting with this one."
2,not so hot,Performance for this USB adapter is fair at best. Price was right at $9.98 used with shipping. I wish that I would have spent more and got a faster adapter.
2,Flaky sometimes lost connection for no reason,"I'd been using this USB wifi device for a month without problems, then suddenly it stopped working and wouldn't see my wireless AP. I thought maybe my router had locked up or something but I noticed all my other wireless devices in the house were still working fine. I tried several things but couldn't get it to see my wireless network. I reset my router anyway just in case, and it still didn't work.finally the only thing that got it to work was to go into the properties of the device and select the wifi network to be 802.11b/g only and not include 'n'. this made it work again with my router. My router does support 'n' but I don't use it, I only have the 'g' network enabled. So it seems like this USB device got confused and kept trying to use 'n'....anyway just glad i got it working, but not happy with this device since it took me so long to get it working again, and it was just luck that got it working now."
3,One of Two still work.,I bought two of these for my house and one of them died after a year so I tossed it. The other is still working like a champ but has to be unplugged and plugged back in once in awhile because it loses it's connection with my home WiFi.
4,Just as described,This item does what the description says it will. I cannot tell you the range that it will pick up a wireless signal as mine is not too far away from my router. I have only had about 2 times where it has dropped signal (may not have been the devices fault and I think this is a normal thing). Even with my laptop it would occassionally drop the signal. Not a deal breaker for me. If this fits your price range it works very well and my connection speeds are as good as any other device I have used (I do not feel I have degraded signal with it). I think you'll be pleased with this item.
1,The Allergy to Vista Continues,"When I received this product and loaded the software, it was immediately apparent that it was user unfriendly on my Vista Home 32 bit system. Even after I went to D-Link's web site and was able to find drivers for the unit, it slowed the entire system and began displaying cannot find file windows every time I booted up my computer. Now I have to return the device to the Amazon Retailer at my expense. I bought a D-link draft n interface for my computer in hopes that it would be transformed into one that matches the currently good performance of my d-link draft n 655 router. Save your money until you can get a computer with a draft n card. At least then you probably wont notice that you are only getting .g speed."
1,Doesn't play well with Vista,"This is my first item review. I just returned this adapter, as it doesn't seem to work with Vista. Now, it could be that I got a bad adapter, but it would start to work and then just lose the connection. Also, the software that D Link provides is not compatible with Vista and the driver is not digitally signed. It took me quite a bit of research to figure out why the software kept failing to run... I did however get the DLink Xtreme router, and am so far very pleased with it, even though all my adapters are G..."
1,Not reliable on Windows 7,"As I write this review I am sitting here watching the painfully slow progress of installing the patch for WOW onto my grand spanking new PC with Windows 7 64 Bit Home Edition.This wireless adapter has been giving me NOTHING but trouble since the moment I installed the drivers and plugged it in. The signal strength says excellent, yet about every 10 minutes it looses the internet connection and I have to manually reconnect. This is *painful*. It makes me want to start tearing holes into my wall and run internet cords through them.I have found that the Medialink Wireless N USB Adapter seems to have MUCH better reliability for Win 7 overall. I will be giving it a shot before I start punching holes in the wall."
1,First generation wireless N adapter. Claims Vista compliant but read the fine print.,Found a lot of installation issues. You may have to read the d-link websites for new drivers and if you use Vista you will have to dig more. It's a wireless N but very basic. I would say it's a first class generation wireless N adapter.
3,Solid & Cohesive Effort....With Great Lyrics & Melodies....,"I just finished listening this CD tonight. I didn't own it in its original vinyl pressing, so this was my first time hearing the entire album, and there are some great, sweet songs here. Among the favorites I already knew (""Come In From The Rain"" and ""Circles"" among them) I was pleasantly treated to ""Let Mama Know,"" which is becoming a new favorite after only a few repeated listenings. To these add ""Ladybug"" and ""Happier Than The Morning Sun,"" a song about a very contented relationship -- such a central theme in much of Captain & Tennille's music. If you long for the sounds of a more innocent time, and appreciate genuine musical talent along with tender yet intelligent lyrics, you won't be disappointed."
5,Warm & Cozy,"The music on Captain and Tennille's third album fits well with the warm, cozy and quiet album cover photo. This is a great mellow album filled with wonderful music. ""Come In From The Rain"" is one of their all-time best songs. ""Ladybug"" is a song about respecting and appreciating nature and Toni and Daryl do an awesome job on the Stevie Wonder song ""Happier Than The Morning Sun."" ""Circles"", penned by Toni and one of the best pure pop songs I have ever heard (and I've heard lots), should have been a major hit. It's funny, the only song that does not fit well on this album was the hit ""Can't Stop Dancin"" -- it's fun, but should have been left off this album because it is just too frantic for the mellow mood cast by the rest of the songs. This album is great and it's about time it has been released on CD. Here's hoping C & T will record a new album sometime soon!!"
5,Wonderful Group,If you ever loved the Captain & Tennille or if you did not this has got to be one of their best cd's around to bad I never got my copy of this cd then that way I could have had all six cd's but I don't so come in from the rain and enjoy this great husband and wife team.Rondall Banks
3,"GREAT ALBUM, FLAWED CD","The songs on this album are just as great today as when it was originally released in 1977. However, there is at least one flaw in the MASTERING of this CD. During track #6--""Don't Be Scared""-- at time reading 1:29, the song skips a beat. Instead of singing ""...she's run from you..."" Tennille ends up singing ""...she's run foo..."" The second counter does not skip a beat, indicating that the flaw is in the original master and not the individual disk. There may have been more flaws, but I stopped listening after this one as it ruined the whole CD for me. So buyer beware. I waited twenty years for this album to be released on CD. I just hope I don't have to wait another twenty years for them to release the corrected version."
5,"Brighter than expected, very well made","I wanted something I could carry in my pocket, this fits the bill! I would recommend this light to my friends."
4,"Good action, but scratchy!","Having finally viewed Speedtrap i can honestly say that it's surely one of the most underrated car chase films of all time. Combined with decent performances by topline actors in Joe Don Baker and Robert Loggia, they really help bolster the movie along. The stunt driving is superb and rivals the action scenes in 'Gone in 60 Seconds' and 'Vanishing Point'. The downside is the picture and sound quality, which overall is very ordinary and deserves a big restoration for a DVD RELEASE. This is a real must for the car chase enthusiast, so please, some production house should clean it up and bring it out on dvd."
4,Road Rash style returns (just not from EA),"I bought the game because I was a big fan of Road Rash. This game brings back the same feel of high speed, knocking opponents off (no weapons though) and adds a few cool moves like a powerslide to go under obstacles. It also has tricks you can do but they aren't really going to help you in a race, they are put in to help you unlock new bikes and skins. Road Rash and racing game fans should get this game. You will like it. Anyone else, if you are unsure, try a rental first. The game does not support soundtracks, replay saves, or XBOX Live. Lets hope these features are added to Speed Kings 2."
4,Nice for sun protection,"This works very well for sun protection - but I only use it if I know we're going to be out in the sun for long periods of time. It does fold up into a fairly small package, but not small enough for me to find convenient to carry around for spontaneous use. The mesh rests on your child's feet (if your child's legs are long enough) at the bottom. It may bother some kids, since to them, it appears to obstruct their view (you can see through it, but obviously not as clearly as without it). My daughter is irritated when I put it on the stroller (she's 1 1/2 yrs old). The mesh is a plastic-type material, and is fairly closely woven, so it also works well to provide shelter in brief, light rainfall and winds."
2,Not great,"If this were UV-treated, it would be great. However, it's not and you kind of just end up having a false sense of safety. It's still really bright and it gets very hot under there. The big shade things that you can maneuver to shade the baby works better."
5,A 'Must Read' for any Job Hunter!,"A fantastic book brimming with relevant information for any job hunter. Less than 200 pages, this book is a quick read and highlights on every question and anxiety that job hunters have with concise, informative answers. Don't let this book pass you by!"
4,referred by many headhunters,"If I'm hired after my next interview, I'll give it 5 stars. Easy to read reference."
1,Missing pages!,This book was missing the first 26 pages of the text. How am I supposed to learn from a book that is missing pages? I am beyond mad. This was a waste of money. Books that are missing pages should not be sold on amazon.
4,Concise. Targets needs other than interviews.,Concise. Easy to read. Targets your needs. I am not 'interviewing' but it was recommended to consoldate your thoughts to share in reports or speeches.
5,Brilliant,My cousin recommended this book to me shortly after I graduated college and I still thank him. I thought I had the whole interviewing thing down until I read this book. You don't even need to read the entire book; just the first few chapters give you the foundation you need to own every interview you walk in to. This is a must for anyone seeking new/first-time employment. It's like a job-seeker's Bible.
4,Worth the Money!,"Robin Ryan offers job search skills that cuts through the chase. The author knows how the recruitor thinks; moreover, how to skillfully stand-out from all other job applicants (it's true, I made the mistakes). In a very organized and readable format, the author teaches the reader on how to be BE PREPARED in your job interview."
2,Barely Useful...,"I bought this book because it is popular at the American Graduate School of International Management. I don't know what the MIM candidates at Thunderbird are doing with it because the information in the book sounds almost childish for Graduate students. If you are an MBA (or MIM) student looking for some good advice on your career pursuits, I strongly encourage you not to buy this book and try Dr. Green's ""Get Hired!"" instead."
5,60 Seconds and your Hired,The book is very helpful and the service was great - faster than promised and very polite
5,"nice adaptor, real simple","I got this for my CNC machine's porter cable laminate trim router with 1/4"" chuck. after searching the net and finding only a few adaptors out there for way too much money, this was a nice price. it seems to work well too. If you need to adapt endmills and drills and such in your CNC's router, Get it! converts 1/4"" to 1/8"" bits..."
5,Just What I Needed,Using a trim router for mother of pearl inlay. Needed the adapter to use small bits. Works great.
4,Fascinating legal battle,"This movie is a fascinating account of Larry Flynt's battle to protect his right to free speech even when that speech was considered raunchy and obscene by many. He took the battle all the way to the Supreme Court. The story is very captivating and makes for a very good movie.At times, though, it is difficult to follow just what motivated Larry Flynt. Was he just trying to make a buck with his magazine? Was he a crusader for constitutional rights? or a crusader against the Moral Majority? Was he some sort of bizarre spiritual leader himself? Was he simply a man in an unorthodox but very committed love affair with his life?Larry Flynt was and is all of those things, and it makes for a compelling story, and yet it might have made for an even better movie if these different aspects of Larry Flynt's life could have been woven together better to present a more coherent picture of the complete man."
1,The People Rest Their Case...,"I was dissappointed by this film. I should have seen it coming, though. I suppose we, the viewers are supposed to be made to pity poor Larry Flynt while we watch him defend his rights to make lots of cash peddling porn. The story is punctuated by a series of sex scenes featuring drug abuse, alcohol, and so on. Poor Larry Flynt. For technical aspects, Woody Harrelson was great, and so was the rest of the cast.Some documentaries are best left to A&E."
1,Unbelievably boring,Who cares about Larry Flunt? He's some redneck who tried to make a splash with a dirty pictures magazine. Big deal. That was two boring hours of my life I'll never get back....
3,VHS film,My fault for not checking that it was a tape instead of a CD. Now I have to find a tape player to watch it.
4,Very good film,"This is a very good film. It's well acted and well directed. I agree with the review written by Dennis Littrel., but write to add just two thoughts:First, this is the type of film that should be made more often. It'd doesn't fall into the typical Hollywood formula of smaltzh, but instead actually has a message. Hate Larry Flynt if you will, but respect the fact that he did us all a great service by testing the limits of our tolerance for 1st Amendment values. It's a great civic lesson.Second, Coutney Love is OUTSTANDING in this role. She has a charisma that cuts through the screen, and reaches the viewer in ways that I never would have expected from her. Ok, maybe playing a junkie was not much of a stretch for her. But she does it with pure magnestism. Bravo to Ms. Love."
3,Not what i was expecting,"I have no idea how a story about the man who started the infamous Hustler mag. could be kinda boring. I sat down expecting a great movie and it was slow and kinda jumped around a little too much. Maybe i am being subjective because i am not a huge Courtney Love fan, and not that big of a fan of Woody's either. But never the less the script makes the movie and this one wasn't that great. Check it out at Blockbuster before you buy it."
2,Only in Hollywood. . .,". . .could this man be treated as a hero. Honestly: did anybody ever lose money underestimating the taste of the public? Flynt was raking in the dollars with a stupid magazine which holds primitive attitudes toward women, sex and minorities. OK, fine. He has the right to do so. . .maybe an imperative in this country which treats the almighty dollar as the purpose of existence. . .and he can appeal his right to do so all the way to the Supreme Court. But is he a hero? Great. We live in an age which could use a few heroes, and Milos Forman (who I once thought a semi-great director) spends his producers' money on a flick celebrating a stupid redneck and his crazy wife. (Although I must give kudos for his casting--he found the perfect actors for the two leads. In fact, I don't think either one was 'acting' at all. Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love were made for their roles.)"
2,"Satisfactory movie, moronic subject","Clearly, the world needs more cynics. Did, or does, Larry Flynt really care about the First Amendment? You bet, but only because it lets him make a livelihood selling pornographic magazines that also attack minorities and gays. I can't wait for the Hollywood movie that portrays Charles Manson as a kind-hearted performance artist who only wanted to use human blood and entrails as a medium."
5,"Great movie, definitely worth seeing","I can understand that a lot of people on this board don't like the topic of this movie, but that shouldn't keep them from enjoying a fantastic movie. I personally found this movie absolutely hilarious--Larry Flynt is definitely a colorful character, as is Althea. Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love, and Edward Norton give outstanding performances. It's really amazing to see how a dirt poor red neck kid can end up being a millionaire. You'll be left wondering what stunt is Larry Flynt going to pull next. So what if Hustler is disgusting to you? As Edward Norton said, you have the right to not buy it. A brilliant, brilliant film. I would definitely recommend picking this one up."
4,Larry Flynt-Yeah,"Other than this version of this film, this screener was delivered with real intensity, by the primary character actors, Woody H., Cobains ex wife, she totally owned it! Fabulous performance..."
3,A Painful Lullaby,"I don't like books that put me to sleep and this one did. I was hoping to read in detail about intranets (hardware, software,and construction) but this book was pretty basic. It would be no help to someone looking to create an Intranet from scratch but more for someone who wants a 400 page dictionary definition of Intranet. It was a bore and a waste of time and I suggest you read all the reviews before buying this book."
3,Good cover for the price,"Overall I would say the mattress topper works as described. Be sure to let it air out/fold for 24 hours before using it-like the instructions advise. It's not the most sturdy-when you are sleeping right next to the edge, the corner tends to ""pop out."""
5,Dorm Life,"We bought this for my son to take to college. Everyone told us he would need a mattress topper because of the poor quality of the dorm beds. He loves it! ""It is like sleeping on a cloud mom!"" All of his friend are complaining about how uncomfortable the beds are, but he is happy as a clam.My hubby and I are contemplating buying one for our own bed because of my bad back. Hopefully it works as good as my son says!"
5,Very Comfortable,Product was every bit as good as advertised and a good buy too! I highly recommend this product to potential buyers. Makes for a very comfortable sleep aid.
5,YES!,I never would have believed that this would make as big a difference as it has. Less tossing and turning resulting in a vast improvement in sleep quality. Worth every penny!
5,A real treat,I'm deployed to Afghanistan where I sleep in a tent on a hard brown cot. I would wake up sore all over even if I didn't do anything particularly straining the day before. The moment I laid on the mat it felt like my back was healing. Very comfortable as a mattress on it's own.
4,A Real Sleep Aid,"In the past I've used a 4 inch foam mattress (2 twin size on a king bed) so I wondered if a 3 inch would be adequate. It is. The foam mattress relieves pressure on joints for a much more comfortable night. The only drawback is the odor which remains until it is aired out. I had just moved and needed a good night's sleep so I used it right away. The odor remained a little longer because of this. I noticed that the cat slept on it, odor or no, so I guess the odor is only a little annoying but not dangerous. The product was mailed promptly and received in good condition."
4,Excellent buy,"I bought this for my mother, she had to stay in bed after surgery and I wanted her to be comfortable. she used this pad for a month and she loved it. Of course it is no substitute for the tempuropedic mattress but it is very decent."
2,Isn't as good as other memory foam mattresses I've seen,"It doesn't hold the shape for 15 seconds, as it is supposed to. It's more like 2-3 seconds.It is however fairly comfortable to sleep in.Perhaps, the decrease in quality, reported by other users, is in fact true."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I thought I had found a deal on Amazon. I was mistaken. The product is a little disappointing. In comparison to other memory foam toppers I have on other beds, this one neither offers the same support or bounces back the same. It was also cut irregularly. I had let it air out for a couple days before putting it to use, but the ends of the foam were crooked. Also, the size didn't fit fully over the mattress."
1,"Nasty, Toxic smell","I ordered to replace an older topper purchased ages ago from Target. This topper is basically just rough cut industrial foam: No tapering on the edges, no cover. The cut size is approximate---not refined. It arrived in a clear plastic trash bag. It smells so strong and sharp we could not sleep and had to move to the guest room. Save your time---pay $20 more for one designated for sleeping (non Toxic, with a cover)"
3,Could be better,"I've had this foam mattress for two years, the odor didn't last once it was aired out in another room for a few days. The mattress is too short by about an inch or two, a queen won't fit the regular queen mattress, so I purchased a king for my queen. No surprise! The king was too short for the queen! This foam topper will follow the contours of the existing mattress, any depression in the original mattress will show up under the topper. If you have an old mattress, bite the bullet and buy a good mattress."
3,Sad story,This shows what can happen when you make the wrong decisions in life at an early age and have to live with it.
5,Coming Home,"Hearing Ruth and Billy Graham: What Grace Provides is an experience like returning home after a long lapse. While I no longer expouse the faith of the Graham's, hearing the simple hymns of my youth was a delight. This CD provided me with an opportunity to reconnect with the roots of my faith. Richard Putnam captures the elegance of the hymns and the gracefulness of the Grahams. This CD captures the simplicity and eloquence of the Graham ministry."
2,badly organized,"This, the 5th edition, is badly organized compared to the 4th. You often cant try things as you read about them. This is especially true for the chapters on style sheets. I think the trouble is that the book tries to cover HTML and XHTML simultaneously. While there is obviously alot of overlap, there are enough ideosynracies to scramble the natural order of presentation. Compounding that is the small size and format of the book. Many of the examples are incomplete or not well connected to the text just because they wouldn't fit otherwise.I'm going back to the 4th edition. XHTML can wait."
4,Lots of information,"While not for the complete beginner, it's an excellent resource for HTML programmers.Many techniques and pitfalls are discussed, along with reasonably clear step-by-step instructions.While highly detailed for the most part, some places are surprisingly lean. For example, the very important ""class"" attribute has only 2 references in the index, and is given very short shrift in the text. This will have some beginners scratching their heads, no doubt.But overall, this book contains many valuable insights and is worth having in your collection."
3,Not great for beginners,"Some of the examples are less than clear or rather entirely incomplete and should have been much longer. This lead to having to go on the books website nearly every time I was working through examples once I got to chapter 14. I dont have any other suggestions for good books to learn with, since this is my first html book. You have been told."
2,Overrated book,This bought this book because of the rave reviews it received from so many others. However I thought this book fell short on providing practical examples for creating web pages.
1,Very hard to understand.,The book jumps all over the place with references to pages throughout the book from the 1st chapter on. I did not find it easy to understand. It actually make creating a web page/site a lot harder than it actually is.
2,Out-of-date,"Sure, maybe this book was helpful a few years ago, but now it's too out-dated and doesn't cover enough topics. I can't speak for the more updated version of this text, but I'd advise getting a book from sitepoint (like the CSS Anthology) instead."
3,Good but hard for students to follow,"I read the excellent reviews of this book, ordered it then adopted it for college level course as an intro to HTML after my other book went out of print. After 2 semester now I find the book is very difficult for students to follow to build their own web sites. Examples are not complete enought and I have to fill in a lot of things for my students. My students range from Junior and Seniors at a University to Grad students from a wide range of disciplines.I now realize this book is not clear enough to really help those new to HTML."
5,CSS rocks!,"This is a great book for getting your coding skills up to speed! If you don't know the difference between html, xhtml, xml, sgml,& css then this is the book for you. Gives current standards throughout, and is clear and easy to use. It is a required textbook for a class I am taking, and has become my new favorite web-coding/design reference. Contains many clear and well-explained examples, and will allow you to hand-code like a pro."
3,"Good Book, but Outdated",The new one came out about three months after I bought this one (!@#$%). Buy the newest edition.
2,Very frustrating,"I can't believe this book has been getting such great reviews....I am a smart person, but this book is so frustrating to get through! There is so much excess information -- the layout is terrible and the chapters poorly organized. I just want to know the basics about HTML and Ms. Castro doesn't seem to ever get there. In the beginning chapters of the book she refers to concepts we haven't even learned yet. It was terribly frustrating to read and I just simply gave up!"
5,Review for very useful HTML reference book,"This book is the #1 best-selling book on HTML and I can see why. I started with no knowledge of HTML whatsoever two months ago and was able to build my site 'website-traffic-resources' with the help of Elisabeth Castro's visual quickstart guide. I use the book all the time as a reference book to quickly look up HTML elements. ""HTML For The World Wide Web"" is clearly structured and the combination of the text guides with HTML code and website 'screenshots' make it particularly useful. The Table of Content and the Index make it easy to find the items you are looking for and the book is built so that you can read only the sections you need for now. Time saving and highly recommended!"
2,Didn't quite get there.,"This book was perscribed text for my university class ""Introduction to Web Design"" and I found it a frustrating experience. Whist Castro gives ""how to"" instructions they are not always clear, and examples are not given for everything. Unfortuantely a lot of my class mates shared my frustrations, and I am not looking forward to the next class on advanced web design simply because this is the perscribed text for that one too.There are much better books on the market, specifically ""The Complete Reference to HTML & XHTML"" published by Osbourne."
2,HTML For the World Wide Web,"All in all this book is great if you want to learn how to do something quick and dirty. But if you are serious get this book and a reference book. This book does a great job of showing you the wrong way to do something, then it says ""Oh by the way that was the wrong way to do it, now we will show you the right way"". (same for her javascript book, for instance the rollovers) I almost pulled my hair out when I was trying to read chapter #8 on creating Style Rules and the author didn't even bother telling me where to put the rules. When I went to the website the example of page #34 it wasn't even on the website. This is a kidde book for quick information, not to be taken serious for power users."
4,"Good reference, a little outdated","This book is an excellent companion to any educational course you might be taking in XHTML or CSS. It's nice for looking up little bits of information like tags or syntax structure. Castro does a nice job of giving alternative solutions, some based on Transitional XHTML, some based on the Strict form. I believe there is a newer edition available that is modernized with a few more rules and bits of advice that are more suitable for today's web designer. I would recommend that, but there's not a huge difference between the newest version and this one."
4,Good to the End!,"Lost in the Ivy was an excellent mystery, especially for a first book--believeable hero, interesting plot and twists, and it kept me going to the end. I particularly appreciated the added information about Wrigley Field and the Cubs. I'm old enough not to want to waste my time, so will be buying Richardson's subsequent books, knowing I'll get my time and money's worth."
5,A true mystery till the end,"This book has it all, a love story, murder mystery and even sports trivia. I loved the way the story began with the judge in the chamber, and then flowed through to the big scene at the courthouse. The characters introduced in the beginning were very well developed as the book went on. The best part was that I had no inkling until the last chapter, who was actually doing what to whom. A true mystery and expertly written. I would reccomend this book to all of my friends, whether they are sports fans or not. A truly great read!"
5,GREAT Read,"I've never been an avid reader...after the first 30 pages I usually become bored and never finish a book. However, this was not the case with ""Lost in the Ivy."" I started reading the book and couldn't put it down until I read the entire book. The story flowed from chapter to chapter introducing a new character or mystery and, therefore, at times I felt I was lost in the ivy. I can't wait to read more books by this talented writer. He has given me a reason to read again."
3,Good sun shade,"This is a good sun shade that is easy to put on....only complaint is that I wish it had something to attach it to the bottom of the stroller as well as the top. My child kept kicking it and pulling it in on her because it isn't attached at the bottom, it just drapes from the top."
1,poor quality - rips easily,"Bought a Maclaren sun protector because I thought it would be better quality, but it wasn't.After 3 months of use, it ripped without cause, at the attachment points; it is not designed well.I bought mine at a Maclaren store, but they said it is not covered by warranty.So, I recommend against Maclaren in general."
3,A Biography of a Man that is Much More that What is Presented,"This is the second Burt Lancaster biography I read.I liked the first so much that I wanted to know more about such a legendary Holywood actor.I think that Kate Buford emphasized too much certain negative aspects of the actor, aspects that moreover were not proven, and maybe there were not truth.The biography is detailed but, again, as it is about a great actor, an actor that was a milestone in the Hollywood history, I think that there are a lot of aspects in Lancaster personal or professional life that are worthy to be emphasized, instead oftalking about things that ""maybe happened"".Anyway, after the first biography I read, I am motivated to know more about that ""singular man"" and wonderful actor."
5,good read,This was brought for my mom and she really loved it. Good info and lots of pictures inside this book.
1,Could Lancaster really have been as boring as this?,"I bought the book as a moviegoer who has always found Lancaster an unusually powerful screen presence. He looks like he must have been an uncommon personality. You'd never guess it after reading this. Too much emphasis on the history of the film industry, not enough information or anecdotes about the man. And the editing is terrible ... lots of paragraphs that just don't hold together, irrelevant notes that an editor should have chopped (the geneology of the Lancaster name ... for a high-school level biography, maybe, but not for a pro). Maybe Lancaster turned out to be boring, and the author had to fill in the book with all this extra stuff to meet her obligations to the publisher?"
5,The real problem with retailers.,Terri not only gives real life examples of how today's employees are not engaged she also goes deep to show that it's more than just hiring smiling faces. She knows that the key to retailing success and branding lies with the people who meet the customers everyday and any retailer who wants to succeed in today's competitive marketplace should read this book.
5,WOW!,"I hate buying remanufactured anything, but this item has last me a long time. I like it more then the Ipods because it does more like built in radio, and recording (voice). 5gb was plenty and less confusion for looking through songs, and time saving. The customer service was very helpful, and showed me how to do more things. Works great!!"
3,OVER RATED,"Paid $10.00 for the book what a waste of money. very boring to me, slow paced. There was no fire between Ivy and whats his name I've already forgot his name. I gave 3 stars because I like Diana Palmer. Dont pay to much for the book."
3,sometimes funny often obvious,"I thought from the reviews this book would be more of a Gulliver's Travels through the world of money. Unfortunately, the author was at least somewhat serious as he tried to figure out what to do with his windfall. So at the end of each chapter there was a little lesson he learned. These by and large turned out to be obvious, Don't gamble, don't fritter it away, most people aren't cut out to be entrepreneurs. I expect the second half of the book will be full of equally obvious truths if I get around to finishing it.I was looking more for an enjoyable description of the ride rather than a concise summary of the destination.The simple truth about money is that it is vastly overrated. Should you be lucky enough to have a windfall drop in your lap, don't be stupid with it and don't expect it bring happiness. Your life will change less than you think."
1,Poor layout,"This book should retail for 8.99 or less! It's just a poor-quality reprint of an old, typed manuscript with the diacritics handwritten in, and of course it's all in the Old spelling which is not so bad but it can create confusion for the newbie. Come on people, it's 2005, let's take the time to scan reprint texts in and put them in a nice font! It doesn't take *that* long! (I know, I have done this for my job!!)"
5,Realista,"Aunque la trama de la novela no es muy convincente, la realidad de la vida en Cuba antes, durante y despues del triunfo de la revolucion Castrista a travez de la vida de Cuca Martinez y aquellas personas que se entrelazan con ella. Muy bueno leerlo para aquellos que conocen muy de cerca la verdad que envuelve Cuba, su gente y su regimen."
2,No puede ser peor,"La historia empiezA por un lado, sigue por otro, se olvida el hilo y termina en otro sitio sin que nos enteremos nunca del final de lo que comenzara a contar al inicio. Para colmo de males la prosa es pesima. Me dio la impresión de que era alguien semi-analfabeto que intentaba contar un cuento sin lograrlo. Aunque insiste todo el tiempo en hacer citas ""cultas"" (y en muchas hay errores de nombres y fechas) todo ese alarde de cultura se queda en nada."
2,Poor as propaganda and as literature,"Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the Cuban dissident writer who lives in London, appears to be always present in ""Te di la vida entera"". Ms Valdes refers to his physical presence in some moments and, above all, Infante is a big influence in her way of writing.Like Infante, Ms. Valdes hates Castro and the Revolution; like Infante, she makes use of a strong eroticism; like Infante, she likes to tell jokes and to play with the words, in a way which resembles erudiction. Unhappily to us, Ms. Valdes is not as talented as Cabrera Infante. So the literature gives way to an angry panphlet. Remember ""Strawberry and Chocolate"" to see we can recognize the dignity of the Cuban people even if we are critical of the Cuban regime."
4,Great for practice and basics,"I also used this product while I was learning German in high school. I've used other products and LiveMocha, but I really like this interactive application so I can hear and read the words. I've found it useful over the years and I think it's great if you want to learn some German for fun."
5,Family Guy gets Christmas right.,"Even though it begins with Stewie wanting to kill Santa, it gets Christmas right at the end. The first song is about Christmas greed. The conclusion is to save Christmas by curbing our appetites to gorge on stuff. It will probably start a ""Just One Gift"" movement."
2,Waste of time and money,"If you are looking for a stream of uncensored family guy episodes, keep looking. It seems like you need the dvd to get uncensored."
5,great to watch when trying to kill time,was glad i was able to watch this at work when i had some down time. looks great and really funny.
4,Ha I love Family Guy,There is not much to say or add to the reviews. I mean I love to watch the Family Guy show.
3,"""Educate yourself you fool"" - my fav line","This christmas episode starts out soo funny, kinda loses it for me in the end though - too much blood and gore."
4,Love FG,Any episode of Fqmily guy is awesome so might as well but this. Family guy is the best show ever!
2,Decent but overpriced!,"The contents are solid, but $32.00 is an outrageous sum for what amounts to an oversized brochure (big print, lots of white space and only 92 pages long). You will get much better value for your money by buying any of several EMT-B pocket references available. More content, lower price, and a much more convenient form factor. The AAOS should be ashamed of itself for gouging the profession like this."
4,Good Reference for EMS and others in Emergency medicine.,I have had the pleasure of meeting the author and find that this is a very comprhensive guide for such a short book in being able to quickly triage and determine a treatment pathway based on the acuity of the patient.
1,Mine didn't work either...,"I ordered this in mid-January and had the same problem as recent people. I ordered it cause I thought it would work and was quiet. I thought it was nice (very quiet) but after a week of running, I noticed it never got 1 drop of water out of the air. I had it set to run until it hit the right humidity. So if it was running constantly for a week, it should have put some water in the bucket (otherwise it should have shut off).I went back on Amazon and saw the recent reviews about it not working and the horrible customer service from the company so I requested a refund from Amazon and sent it back to them. Hopefully I'll get all my money back. Seems like the Soleus company dumped some bad ones off on Amazon (with some that worked) and hoped people would not deal with their return policy that forces the customer to pay for shipping it back to them in California."
4,"Great, reliable unit","I've been using the Soleus humidifier since late May for my basement. My basement has never been very damp, but you can notice it more on very hot or humid days.Pros:- Quiet. I wouldn't say necessary ""whisper"" quiet, but it's definitely no louder than a small desk fan and much quieter than other humidifier units I've heard.- Energy efficient. I've barely noticed a difference in my electric bill- Stylish design, easy controls- Definitely keeps my basement less humid- Adjustable thermostat. It has 4 settings, continuous, 70%, 60%, and 50% relative humidity- Easily portable. Includes a handle.Cons:- The water collection basket on the bottom is sometimes a little difficult to removeOverall I would highly recommend this unit. I've had trouble-free use out if for about 3 months and it's perfect for my basement. If you have a very large room, you may want the larger size."
5,Quite possibly the perfect dehumidifer,"After researching several brands on the market and finding overwhelming praise for the Soleus, I almost expected it to fall short of my expectations. However, I have been amazed with its performance. It is extremely quiet and energy efficient. At the same time, it's a workhorse. This thing sucks out more water per minute than a thirsty musk elk. This dehumidifier has exceeded my expectations and is one of the most rewarding purchases I've made in the past year. Very well packaged."
5,Cynic Reclaimed,"We all have experienced varying success with certain tools. This tool is genuinely works (it took buckets of water out of my basement)and works very well. It appears very well made once you begin to use it.The only possible negative is that I seemed to congest a little more at night. Simple solution: turn it off at night.I had a large and increasing wet spot on my basement floor - I was concerned that I might have had a plumbing leak; however, this unit essentially cleared the entire moist area. Etc."
1,Plugged in one week and not a drop of water collected,"It looks pretty and it's quiet, but either I've got the world's driest basement or my unit is totally ineffective."
2,"Ouch, my finger!","The water level floater was a misaligned and got caught on the sensor toggle. Trying to reinsert the tray, I ripped a good bit of flesh off the top of my finger. Now the sensor always says full. Needless to say, I've returned the product for a replacement. I'd also like to mention, the dust filter on the back was cracked on receipt, the plastic doesn't seem very durable (brittle). Other than the above, this baby sucked gobs of moisture out of the air, the tank needed emptying once a day. Kinda heavy to be moving from room to room, though."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I purchased 2 units outside of amazon since it was cheaper. They did not work in a humid basement at ~65F. It is supposed to work down to about 38F. I called soleus support and they suggested keeping it on the constant/low setting for a couple of days. Did not draw a drop of water. On one unit the coils in the back were not even cold. I was able to ship them back for replacements, however one unit they just sent right back to me since I checked the serial number!!!Same results, no water. So I sent these back for replacements. The replacements arrived, same results, no water. So I finally got in touch with the retailer and was able to send the units back to soleus for a refund. I'm still waiting on the refund but its supposed to be approved.I've noticed that there are some other brands that look very similar to soleus so I think these are just a generic made-in-china dehumidifier with different branding on the outside.DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,"Works Good, Could use a humidity display","Only had this item for 3 weeks, but it seems to work good. Extremely quiet, even on the high level. One improvement could be a digital display of the room humidity."
1,Corrosion problem,"We ordered one about 2 months ago and another about 1 month ago after the first seemed to be working very well. However, the water in the pan of the first unit started to turn blue a week later. This is getting worse and the efficiency of the unit has dropped. It is collecting very little water now, even in very humid weather.The blue color is also showing up in the second unit.I have not opened the units but am assuming that the blue is from copper salts coming off of corroding cooling elements."
2,Good while it lasted,"I was satisfied with this unit while it worked. It was only used about 3 months per year and not every day, to reduce humidity in one of the bedrooms in our home. Well, 2 years down the road, I estimate, under 300 hours of work, it turned into an expensive fan. I read other reviews here on amazon and they state that the company was not responsive when a local tech contacted them to supply parts for out of warranty repairs.How nice. I wonder, how much more would a similar unit cost to be manufactured for durability? Nothing crazy, but to last 7-8 years under light usage. I would gladly pay %30 over the price of existing units, but based on reviews they all fail. Is there a quality brand you can buy and forget?"
2,Does NOT last long!,Bought in September 2009. Worked well till fall 2010. Now in May 2011 the fan and condenser run but the coils do not cool and no water is extracted. Repairs are to expensive. Original cost $228!
1,"When good, good; when defective, DISASTROUS",Bought a new one for octogenarian parents. Worked 2 months (just past return time without penalty). Paid in excess of $50. for shipping another. It has NEVER worked. Rating: NO STARS!!!! (I had to give one just to do the review)
1,Less than 3 months,"I bought this dehumidifier because of the reviews of how quiet it was.From the beginning it didn't work very well, and the people at the Soleus assistance line was about as rude as you can get.The dehumidifier quit working after about 2 months, and hasn't worked since. As far as I am concerned, IT'S A PIECE OF JUNK!!!Amazon, if you are reading this, you need to think about dumping this line of products."
1,"Bad product, Bad service from Soleus, Excellent support from Amazon.com","I bought this product by reading the reviews. The unit ran continuously but never collected a drop of water. In the first page of the manual, there was a big STOP sign reminding me to call the toll free number if the unit does not work and not to return the product to the store. I called the number repeatedly for a week and left several messages. Finally, after a week a rep called me back and arranged to send a return label. He promissed me to send a replacement unit only after he receives the original unit. After one month, a received a replacement unit. This unit worked for a week. It then ran continuously without collecting a drop of water. I called Amazon.com. They agreed to refund my money. In the mean time, I was out of a dehumidifier for two and a half months. I would never buy a product from Soleus."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"The Soleum Air Dehumidifier is out of sight -- a great product. What I like most is that it is very, very quiet! The house sitter even commented on not realizing she had to empty the dehumidifier because it is sooooooo quiet. I love it! Have recommeded it to several friends -- and would buy it all over again in a heartbeat!"
1,Non-existent Customer Support,"Do not buy this company's products! I purchased the CFM-25E-25 Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat in Sep of 2005 and it stopped working. I called the listed phone number for ""Warranty, Technical Support and Customer Service"" four times and had to leave messages (no one would answer). I then mailed a letter of complaint and asked for a refund. No Soleus representative has responded to my requests for service in any form or fasion. I now see that other customers are having the same issues with Soleus not responding to requests for warranty service. This company sells faulty equipment that you cannot get repaired, replaced or receive a refund from!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS BRAND!! ONLY ONE YEAR WARRANTY,Terrible warranty. Most brands have 2 to 5 years warranty. Soleus has only a one year warrantyMine worked year one but didn't year 2.
2,"Ran like a Champ for a while, then completely died.","This unit was really great while it lasted; quiet operation; economic; pulled tons of moisture from the air every day. I used it from April to October 2008. Stored it according to instructions through the winter. Set it back out in May 2009 and it will not collect wanter any longer, and have discovered from the reviews this is typical performance. Missed being under warranty by one month, of course. I paid $200, unit lasted 5 months, making it $40 per month to operate one season. June 2009, I bought an LG replacement unit rather than take another chance on Soleus."
1,Short life,"This dehumidifier is the best as far as light weight, low temp operation, and quiet mode, but runs far short in the reliability department. It quit after a 2 1/2 years of operation which is way too short of a lifespan for any appliance.The compression still comes on but doesn't cool the coils. That indicates a faulty compressor or the refrigerant leaked out. It would cost more to get the unit repaired that to replace with a different dehumidifier.After reading all the horrible reviews on customer service I felt that it would be a waste of time to call them."
4,"Love it, Very Quiet",I really like it. at first it wasn't collecting any water and I called the company. They told me to put in on the lowest setting - quiet and continuous. I tried it and it works. I put it on too high of a setting before. I haven't tried the other settings because this one seems to work great.
2,so so,"Not too happy with this thing. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. As far as shutting off when full, that it does do. I miss my old one that lasted more than 15 years. Not sure what is wrong with this one but I hate to throw it out, even if it only works sometimes."
2,died after 18 months,worked great till the orfice tube got plugged up or lost freon.theres no freon filter like your car so..i called the co and they said sorry no filter in future plans.its a shame because it works awesome when new.debating on buying a new one every 12-18 months.EDIT - It was low on freon. I fixed it hurray. Repair is not for novices.
2,doesnot last long,Soleus Air CFM-25E 25-Pint Dehumidifier with HumidistatI purchased this item August 10 2007 from you and it lasted less then 13 months. I do not reccommend that you buy it.
5,Efficient and Quiet,"This dehumidifier works great. It is very quiet, sounds like a typical oscillating 13inch fan. I was very surprised on how little noise it makes. It is also pulls quite a lot of moisture from the air. I have a moist basement and I empty the storage tank once a day. I run the machine literally 24 hours a day and have had no problems at all. I cannot think of anything that would make this product better!"
5,"No more humid, musty order",I read the pro and con reviews and decided to buy the item. Glad I did.Why? Immediate fast free delivery - worked first time out of the box. Basement orde4r gone within five hours. Have not turned it off since delivery and pulls water out of the air like we cannot believe. Removing the water container and emptying it is no problem.
5,Soleus Air CFM-25 25-Pint Dehumidifier with Humidistat,"I've been using this dehumidifier for 2 months and it works great! I live near the ocean and so previously all my papers and books curled. Now, with the dehumidifier, all paper is dry and flat. The machine reliably pulls out a tankfull each day. It's quiet and easy to use."
1,Same story: Works great for a few months then dies.,"I purchased mine in October 2006. It died at the end of February 2007. I was hoping that I would not be one of the apparently unlucky few whose units crapped out on them. But here I am. I've got an email and phone call in to Soleus, but based on others' experiences, I am not very hopeful that this will be resolved."
1,Does NOT work,"Bought this item in September '07. Does not work, and the company has not helped at all. Still stuck with the dehumidifier that does not work. Basically lost out on $160.00. Do NOT recommend at all."
5,The Best,Read the reviews for products. People will tell you if something is good or not. This thing is quiet and performs great. It also looks good.
1,Soleus Air CFM-25E 25-Pint Dehumidifier,I wish I ncould leave feed back on this item. Item was shipped but did not work. When I returned it and requested a replacement I was issued a refund instead. Found a simular modle at HD for less money that works perfectly.
1,DOES ANYBODY MAKE A GOOD ONE?,This item failed immediately. Other brands lasted only a little longer. Avoid it.
1,Thanks but No Thanks!,"After reading some of the horror stories about this company I decided not to buy one of these. I don't understand how a company can survive and stay in business based on the consistant poor service it provides. Amazon does a good job helping us find the right products and companies to choose...heck, now I'm sounding like a commercial."
1,"Don't believe the ""ships in 24 hours"" hype","So, I ordered this on July 19, and and didn't hit the road till July 25. Once I get it, I trust it will do the job, but I'm highly unimpressed with the turn-around on orders."
4,Super Quiet!,"I love this product so far. The biggest selling point for me is that it very quiet even on it's highest setting. The only thing that I would improve upon if I were this company is the water collecting tank is a bit clunky to handle when it's full, so you have to be careful not to drop it. But other than that....I'm very pleased."
4,good but not great,should have gotten the larger one - 25 pints must be emptied daily. minor hassles inserting the float. runs quiet and well and may be fine for smaller space than a basement.
5,"Soleus CFM-25E is quiet, convenient and easy on the eyes","After using 2 dehumidifiers (from another maker) each that died within 1 year of operation, this model by Soleus was a welcome change. It is simple to operate and its Quiet power level mode allows it to be placed within a busy room without intruding on the ambient noise level. Unlike many other dehumidifiers, its slim yet rounded shape allows it to blend in with a room's decor without announcing its intended purpose. The built-in folding carry handle allows the CFM-25E to live up to its name as a ""portable"" - a factor also missing from its competitors."
5,Soleus 25-pint Dehumidifier,"This is a great humidifier! The tray for catching the water has a large, open top, which makes it easy to clean. I like to use the water I catch, and it's pretty easy to pour it into a pail or other container as long as I'm careful to tip it to the corner away from the filter. VERY QUIET!"
1,dies way too quickly...,Bought this in July 2009. Worked great. Just stopped working after two years. For $200 I think that's too fast. Nothing to be done but buy a new one. Apparently there are no reliable dehumidifiers but this one definitely isn't!
1,A $180 Paperweight,"I think the title says it all. I bought this item last year and for the summer it worked great in the basement. Cleaned and stored it for the winter and brought it back out a couple of weeks ago and it has not had one drop of water in it. Called Soleus and was told to change the settings and try it for 12-15 hours and all I got was a higher electric bill. Called back for a place I could take it to get it fixed and was told they have no idea. They do not offer a list of places near you were you could take it to get it fixed. The other sad part is the 1 year warranty that should be for at least 2 years since most people do not use the item all year long. I just went to Sam's and bought a new one with a 4 year ""take it back and get a new one"" warranty."
5,My dehumidifier,"I was shocked at how much water was pulled from the air. During very humid days, you will have to empty about every 18-24 hours if you are not set up for a constant drain. I'm glad I got this size because I would have a hard time lifting something larger from the floor."
5,The very best dehumidifier,Have endured several other brands that all seemed to either fail after the warranty expired or were loud enough to mimic a super sonic jet taking off.I purchased this Soleus dehumidifier two years ago and it has performed flawlessly. I was concerned about the constantly running fan at first but this is not noticeable on my power bill. I am so impressed I purchased a second unit when on sale recently on Amazon.Thank you Soleus.
1,Died 1 week after warranty ended,"Worked great for a year. A week after the warranty ran out it stopped collecting water. Compressor kicks on, fan runs but no water. Called the company 4 times and emailed 4 times before someone called me back. They said I could mail it in at my expense and then have their technician look at it for $45 an hour! I declined. I'm going to try and get Visa to cover it under their warranty extension program. Do not buy this product.3/27/08 - UpdateBrought it to Sears appliance repair (authorized Soleus repair facility). Repairman found the problem but could not get Soleus to respond to his phone calls or faxes so that he could order parts. Now, I'm back to making a claim with Visa."
5,Works great,"Never owned a dehumidifier before and ended up choosing Soleus Air based on a number of positive Amazon reviews vs competing brands. I have been using the Soleus Air CFM-25E for over a month now and must agree with all the good reviews. Runs quiet, easy to use, easy to empty...all around good job w/ no issues so far. FYI, the 25-pint is a good fit for my room which is about 20x20."
5,Versatile,"I wanted a dehumidifier that was efficient, quiet, and easy and light to move. The Soleus gave me all I wanted."
4,so far so good,"works as described, nice & quiet, should have engineered it so easier to remove water container and also so that it starts up again should it lose power"
4,How to get more from your Soeus Air dehumidifier,"Try buying yourself a DIGITAL HYGOMETOR. (Toss out your old coil one because it can't be relied on for accuracy.) Monitor what the humidity really is. I found the humidity to be much lower than I thought. When the humidity drops to where you have it set, the humidifier stops collecting. You won't see any more water in the water tray until the humidity rises above the setting you have the machine set at. At the ""Dry"" setting, my humidity runs about 54%. On ""Continuous,"" it drops to 30% plus or minus.I purchased an indoor-outdoor hygrometer to monitor out travel trailer from the house. 35% to 40% is a good setting for when the trailer is in storage. If using it indoors, I would want the humidity to be higher. I wish they made this product with a dial type control to be able to set the humidity just where it is needed!"
4,Almost perfect,"We have spent this summer attempting to find a tolerable dehumidifier. Of the 5 brands we brought into our home this was the only one reasonable to use in a space where people live. It is truly quite. It actually pulls the water out of the air. It does not leak. It does not produce astounding amounts of heat.It's draw backs are: 1. Even though it is weighs about half that of those dehumidifiers using the traditional compressor technology, it is still rather hard to move due to having casters instead of wheels. 2. The water catcher is more cumbersome to remove with grace than in other brands."
1,"Worked twice, then stopped","I am very dissapointed with this product. It filled the resevoir twice then stopped, although we still have moisture issues. I would not recommend this product."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this dehumidifier in Oct 2005 after reading all the nice reviews. However, when I got mine, it didn't work. Not a single drop of water. If the humidity level was truely below the setting, the unit is designed to turn off. But it kept running for two days until I switched it off. Did troubleshooting with the manufacturer without any success. Amazon sent me a replacement but it had the same problem.When I came back to Amazon I saw few other buyers had exact same problem in Nov & Dec 2005. Wondering if there was one defective batch. After this experience, I don't have the confidence to recommend this product to anyone."
4,Quiet is the key feature.,"I bought this because the reviews all said how quiet it was and it's true. I can use it in my bedroom at night and all I can really hear is the soft sound of the fan. I've used it almost everyday for about two years with no problems yet. The only cons about it is I wish it had a digital setting so I could keep it on longer. The lowest humidity setting I can get out it on ""Dry"" is about 60%, but it does have an always on button so if I leave the compressor on all the time it keeps my room at a nice 45% humidity. I turn it off if it gets below that. I highly recommend buying a digital humidity gage to know what the humidity is in your room if you buy this product. It would also be nice if it had an automatic restart if the power goes out. But overall I'm happy with this product."
4,"Quiet, simple, effective","Removes a satisfying volume of water with a minimum of fuss. Although mine works mostly in the basement, where it pulls out about 40 pints a day, but it is easy enough to lug to where it is needed - for example, to help some new plaster dry on a humid day - and it is presentable for work in a living space.Researching this purchase it was hard to find what size dehumidifier I needed - some kind webizen persuaded me that, if more was needed, two smaller units would be more flexible than one large unit anyway, and more effective in an area with poor air circulation. I'm glad i went that route."
4,great dehumidifier!,"this one is really really quiet! I have it in the basement and I cant hear it until I am about 7 feet away from it, and its on high.. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the bucket for the water is awkward, no easy way to dump it without making a mess, no ""spout"" to funnel the water out.. I didnt hook up to contstant drainage because I want to be able to move it from room to room.. but all in all, it works and its very quiet!"
5,niflty machine,Operated without a glitch right out of the box. Nifty machine. Great sale price of $139.00. Thanks Amazon.
1,Short term satisfaction,"For the first two months I agree it was a 5 star product, but for this price 2 months seems short lived - as for the warranty well.......One year laterAfter two months the machine quit automaticaly shutting off and flooding everywhere. Customer service is non existent, you have to leave your name and number on an answering machine - and no one ever calls you back called several times over months. Repeated Emails also go completely unanswered as does certified mail. I wanted to get mine repaired under warranty - but you can't if you can't reach the manufacturer.I should have heeded some of the previous warrnings, but saw so many positive reviews, probably like my initial thoughs - short term satisfaction.DO NOT BUY - IF THERE IS A PROBLEM - AND THERE WILL BE - YOU ARE OUT THE COST OF THE MACHINE."
2,worked but not the way that i expected,"the first one i ordered work -less than 24 hours! when i work up the side had come apart and i could see the inside! i sent it back and got a replacement which worked great, really sucked the water out of the air, however, it was not quite as it claimed. it only ran on one setting noisy. it was too loud for our small house. also it looked as if i received a reconditioned unit. the back filter was cracked and had mold on it as did the water basin. i tried to send it back and get another (it really did pull that water out of the air!) but amazon told me they had too many problems and wouldn't ship them out anymore."
5,Love it!,"After 12 years in a humid San Francisco apt, waking up to a waterfall on my bedroom windows every morning, I purchased the Soleus 25 pint dehumidifier. I pulled it out of the box, plugged in it and it began to do it's job immediately! I saw results almost instantly! I can now take a hot shower, run the washer AND the dryer on a day with pouring rain and fog and have not a DROP of condensation on the windows! It's awesome! I run it at night and the quiet hum is just enough to lull one to sleep without disturbing the peace. I highly recommend this product."
2,"Bought on 11/14/2005, stop working within 2 years","When it works, it is great, quiet and efficient.However, it has been only 2 years, and we only run it maybe twice a week during summer."
1,Started out nicely,It worked ok for the first year. Like others have said its quiet and the bucket is a bit kludgy to remove. We only use it in the spring/summer in a 600sf basement. Worked ok and even got through to customer service when we have a question one time.but... This year it does not work. Have tried to contact customer service and it appears they don't answer any more. We have cleaned (wasn't dirty) reset and primed the unit but no water is collected.Not a good investment. Time to look for another brand type. Being that it was only used about 12 months total = FAIL.
5,Another master by the Master,"Here, arranger Cesar Camargo Mariano rides brilliant once again. Elis Regina sings a beautiful tango and also sings two songs by Gilberto Gil. She also launches the career of Brazilian famous composer Joao Bosco. Very very great album."
5,EPIPHANY,"My wife waked into the office, and seeing the tears in my eyes asked me why I was crying. I told her that one of the most beautiful and creative voices in Brasil had died, and listening to this CD was breaking my heart with its beauty. Her vocals, the arrangements, complex, melodic and yet surprisingly simple in the way they embrace her tender vocals.How could the world not be aware of such artistry. One can only wonder at what might have been if she had lived. She could blow your socks off, and she could bring you to tears. Elis was an epiphany."
1,DO NOT USE THIS SELLER! Deserve ZERO stars,This seller took my money and ran with it! They never responded to any of my email attempts and they never sent me the book I need for my class. Not only that they have made it impossible for me to cancel the book (which I do not understand why amazon would allow that but...) I am stuck I can not cancel it and I know they did not even ship it but they did take the money off of my credit card! They are a scam!
2,It was good while it lasted,"I got this fan just under 3 years ago, and it has worked very well up until recently. I noticed that the fan slowed down a lot, but it still worked for a little while longer. Then one day it just stopped spinning. It just makes the humming sound like its trying to spin. I really liked this fan, but I'm very disappointed that it just died all of a sudden."
1,Buy a different fan.,"As far as fans go, this one blows air and oscillates, it's quiet and doesn't vibrate, and basically does everything you need a fan to do. But all fans do that. Par for the course. This fan gets a one-star rating from me for the fact that I could not get mine put together using the included parts. The rear-half of the cage would not fit flush with the motor-compartment, and either the big plastic nut that is supposed to keep it securely in place was too small or the hole in the rear-half of the cage was too big. I was only able to put this fan together by stealing parts from my old fan, which miraculously fit this fan perfectly. So now I'm stuck using some kind of hybrid Frankenfan. My apartment looks like a battle zone with fan parts thrown everywhere. Two fans met in combat, and only one survived.Don't buy this fan. Spend your money on a different fan and you'll be much happier."
5,Great Fan/Great Price,The Soleus Air Fan is just what I was looking for in a fan for my bedroom.Powerful yet quiet I especially like the timer so the fan isn't leftrunning all day.It was easy to assemble took about 15 min's.The remotecontrol is a really cool feature.
1,You get what you pay for,"The 2 big issues I had with this fan are that after the engine warms up it emits a machine like smell that will gradually fill the room if the windows are not fully open. I can't figure out why this happens but it does. The second issue is that on the slow speed setting the plastic blade piece vibrates making a high speed clacking sound so using it when you want to sleep is out, unless you like a fan on high speed when trying to sleep. Maybe it was just mine but I knew that something as cost efficient as this would have risks to it. I decided to return it and get a different one."
4,Very Good,Very Impressed. Installation takes minutes and is intuitive. Weighted base allows fan to be slim but yet very effective. I am ordering a second
2,Not worth the money,"Besides the manual being a bit of a joke, with photo illustrations for only half of the assembly process, the fan itself is not sturdy and poorly manufactured. Obviously, being a discount fan I didn't expect it to be great, but this fan is worthless. Even after the assembly process, the fan is loud and barely emits a what I'd consider a breeze. Likewise, it's unstable-- there is no way to securely bind the top half of the fan with the lower half or adjust the height.Don't waste your money. I'm returning mine."
1,Poor warranty service,"This fan only lasted a few months with intermittant use- the motor slowed down and now only hums. When I contacted Soleus, they said I had to cut off the power cord, send it to them, along with a check for $22.00 to cover return shipping of warranty unit! Since this is close what I paid for the fan, I am going with a brand that has better warranty support."
1,Buyer beware,"This fan came to me first it is very hard to assemble, the base has nuts and bolts that are to little, very little, and I do mean very little instructions. After all that the fans motors would start and then stop and then start again and speed up and then slow down. I did receive this used from Amazon, poorly packed, so I ending up returning it. This is the first, and I hope the last, item I get from amazon used when I paid full price..."
1,Very Poorly Constructed. Buy Something Else!!!,"As others have stated, the manual is a joke. It does not properly explain how to put this together. However, it is not difficult to figure it out.The screws and nuts they sent were the wrong sizes. 2 of the holes drilled for the screws were too small.The fan will only stay positioned so it blows towards the ceiling. When you push/pull on it to pull the fan so that it blows where you want it to, it makes the clicking noise it should but will not lock into place. As soon as you let go of the fan it pulls itself all the way back and points so it blows toward the ceiling.There are many, many fans out there for the same price. (29.99) Buy those. You'll save yourself the trouble of returning this one."
1,Noisy and badly designed,"I should've realized that you get what you pay for. This fan was comparatively inexpensive, and really not worth much. First of all, the fan blade was unbalanced, so on the 2 lower speeds, the wobbly fan action was really loud. At the highest speed, it was less wobbly, but at night that's too much air. Secondly, the height adjustment control was badly designed and just plain didn't work: while assembling the fan, the first time you try to use the height knob, the threads on the screw will get stripped. The manufacturer actually knows this, so has included a second one -- THAT one is sturdier, but it turns out it STILL doesn't function due to poor design. Therefore the fan can't be raised to the normal height of a floor fan -- it's too short.I'll be sending this turkey back."
4,Absolutely love this fan!!!,"Everything about the 'working' of this fan is fantastic!! I particularly LOVE the remote control. The only reason that I wouldn't give it 5 stars is for the same reason that others have stated......putting it together is crazy. The directions are less than adequate and thankfully, after reading the other reviews, I knew that I would need to go to the hardware store and purchase longer screws. I did and was then able to finish putting the fan together. That was a nuisance - but other than that....I love the fan! It is no louder than any other fan would be, and I have it at the foot of my bed blowing directly on me and have no trouble sleeping with the sound."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with this fan. I'm pretty handy when it comes to assembling things, but this fan was more difficult than it should be. The instructions were poorly written and didn't clearly explain what needed to be done. After several attempts I figured it out and the fan works fine, but its very noisy compared to the Windermere fan it replaces. Even at the lowest speed there's quite a bit of noise. We like to listen to the radio at night in our bedroom, but with this fan on we had to turn up the volume on the radio to hear it.Although it's satisfactory, I wouldn't buy another one nor would I recommend it."
5,Soleus Air FSC ly inch stand fan with remote control,"This is the second one of these fans I have purchased. This is a newer model than that purchased a year ago, but I love it. It is easy to turn on and adjust speeds, etc., from my arm chair, easy to put together, and great to have on these hot nights right now."
3,a bit noisy,The fan came in several more pieces than I expected. It works fine but is a bit noisier than my other fans. So-so overall.
3,"Fan good, remote no good.","Nice fan, very quiet, I thought it was easy to assemble. The only complaint I have is that the remote is very ""iffy."" Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn't. Guess it won't kill me to get up and change it manually, but for the price of this fan, I think I paid quite a bit for the remote that doesn't work, so I feel the fan was overpriced."
1,Buy if you have all the time in the world to make it work,The fan worked well for a few months and then the controls began to have problems. I called the company and they wanted more than I had originally paid for the fan to repair it. Buy if you enjoy being frustrated.
3,"Good functions, questionable build quality","Update: Soleus tech support crapped out on me, I got a techie respond to my initial email request about preparing a warranty claim and did not receive a response from them after emailing them a copy of the invoice. I would advise consumers NOT TO BUY SOLEUS PRODUCTS due to the lack of support and shoddy build quality.Original review:I got this fan 11 months ago. The fan has good features and the remote feature is handy to have.However the quality and customer service of Soleus leaves more to be desired. The fan arrived with a cracked motor housing, I contacted Soleus via email and no replies from them period. Now 11 months in the motor of the fan just died for no apparent reason, it still swivels but the fan blades are just stuck stationary with the motor humming. I have just contacted Soleus for a warranty claim, let's hope they respond this time..."
3,Gotta go 1 star because of Assembly and Mechanical Breakdown,"The fan was in more pieces than most I have put together before. The instructions are a joke, small diagrams and low resolution. One of the plastic parts you install to adjust the height was so sharp it cut me . Have to take the dremel rotary sander to file down the jagged edges.However once assembled the fan works great the remote is simple and easy to use with excellent functionality.UPDATE Fan motor burned out after 3 1/2 months...boooooo crummy quality"
5,the gift,I was introduced to this fan by a close friend. She spoke very highly of it had never had a problem with it and that was good enough for me. I gave it as a gift and haven't had a chance to speak to the person that received it. I would definitely purchase another at another time.
1,Sizing is incorrect,Ordered a 38D for someone who has always worn a 38D and it does not fit. Plus the tags are already off so it can't be returned. Won't order from these folks again.
5,Great Moodies,"If you can take the words out of The Moodies songs and just listen to their meaning, you would be moved by the reflections that we all see when we look into the water. Add the music, and the reflections move in such a way that the meaning of the words are painted.The Moody Blues are a great band. Legends in our time!This CD is wonderful, striking and digs into the heart with deep feelings.""Never Blame The Rainbows For The Rain"" and ""Bless The Wings (That Bring You Back)"" has these qualities of taking your soul and releasing it to be free. Listen to the words and feel the music, as your spirit is up-lifted.This is 10 stars ++Long live, The Moody Blues"
3,Keys Can't Unlock Musical Door,"Released with no recordings years before and after, the Moody Blues seemed to be searching for a better sound. It's a shame they fell short of their genius. Concert staples like ""Say It With Love"" and ""Lean On Me (Tonight)"" are not up to par for a group like the Moody Blues. ""Say What You Mean"" only grates with it's repetitive lyrics and ""Magic"" just isn't. However, the album is saved by some nice moody cuts like, ""Bless The Wings..."" and the lovely ""Never Blame The Rainbows For The Rain"". It may not be their best work and there is a reason this was not remastered. Regardless, any Moody Blues fan will enjoy it anyway."
4,Moody Blues Magic,"This was one of the first CD's I purchased way back when. I've always thought it was a great album and I still do. For one who's usually more into upbeat material, I have to admit that the ballads here are at least as good, if not better than the faster tracks. ""Bless the Wings (That Bring You Back)"" is absolutely one of the most gorgeous love songs I've ever heard. Great chorus sung straight from the heart and some really nice instrumentation that fades out only too soon. From other slow tracks like ""Shadows On the Wall"" and ""Never Blame the Rainbows For the Rain"" to the more upbeat numbers like ""Say What You Mean"" and ""Magic"", this album is a delight to listen to most of the way through. Don't be too put off by the negative reviews. I know good song-writing when I hear it and this is definitely it. No matter what kind of music the Moodies attempt to write, it will never sound shallow or meaningless. True Moody Blues fans will know what I'm talking about. Recommended."
3,Not THAT bad!,"This isn't the best effort from the Moodies, but it's certainly not the worst either. There are some very good tunes on this set, namely Say It With Love, Hope and Pray, and Lean on Me (Tonight). Diehhard Moody Blues fans will understand the messages the guys are conveying. For the marginal fans, they may be disappointed. I've always felt the Moodies were judged by a higher standard than most bands, but that's also a compliment to their muscianship."
4,Not as bad as some think,"This album is really a great piece of work. While it's not the absolute best thing they've ever done, it's up there. I find the mix of different styles of songs fun, and I really love Say it With Love. There really isn't a rotten song on the album, as far as I'm concerned. And I find it one of those that you can put on at the beginning, and not touch the CD player again until it's over."
1,Don't Bother,I'm a fan from way way way back. I bought this when it came out. I listened to it exactly once. There is nothing memorable about this CD that will make you want to play it. Save your money.
3,Buy it for one track only,"I grew up listening to the Moody Blues - they formed a large part of the soundscape of my childhood, adolescence and adult life. Their early works were experimental until they developed a very structured commercial sound. Like a lot of recording artists, they started off shakily, matured into a highly respected ensemble with many solid albums to their credit, then started the downhill slide.Keys of the Kingdom is not a highlight of the Moody Blues' career, however, if for no other reason, I would strongly recommend it be purchased on the strength of one song alone: 'Bless the wings (that bring you back)'. It is an excellent Justin Hayward song, extended and beautifully underscored by the string arrangement by Anne Dudley. Sadly, when Universal issued the double CD set 'GOLD' in 2005, they included a truncated single version of this song, thus depriving us of an updated remaster of the full song - a great pity."
5,Makes Dylan Seem Like Brittany Spears,"Years ago, Jim Page used to sing and strum for change out in front of the HUB at the U.W. in Seattle, where he caught an audience from people in between classes. He'd ad lib lyrics depending on who walked by. If he'd recorded some of those live performances they'd be classics now.From this album I'm partial to Down to Eugene.The guy's counter-culturally insightful, humorous, and a genuine creative genius. I'm hoping he's working on some WTO/Sept 11 lyrics to capture the times in his dead-on, inimitable way."
2,"OK, I Guess","This is a book of photographs of dunnies in various Australian locations. It is OK, but I've seen way better."
1,*****WARNING********ALERT****WARNING*****,Do not buy from Timberline Tools for ANY reason.....unless you are willing to wait for your order to clear the Panama Canel!
1,Lawsuit waiting to happen,"As a devoted fan of Middle Earth, I turned each page with increasing wrath as McKiernan shamelessly ripped of Tolkienn at every turn. The characters, the races and their outlooks, the enemy, even down to the details of the protagonists struggle. I can't believe the author did not receive a subpoena from Tolkienn's estate demanding him to cease and desist. I have heard that McKiernan's later works show originality and promise, but I can't bring myself to endorse an author who would stoop to plagiarism of this degree."
3,some book snobs out there,"i find it interesting how some readers are more than happy to rip an author and his work apart. no this work is no where close to the work of Tolkin but on the other hand when i first found it back in 1985 i had never heard of Tolkin... in fact i had never even seen this type of work... give that some thought, this series introduced me too a whole new world of writing! and yes from his mention of Tolkin guess what i bought next! this simple set of books opend a whole new world too me and for that alone i am deeply gratefull!"
3,This little gem demands to be read.,"I am giving this book a very liberal 3 star rating because I was quite impressed with it, even though I believe some people will find the prose quality somewhat lacking. I myself found it a bit silly at first, but then I realized something. McKiernan must picture himself, first and foremost, as an entertainer, one who has been forged within the fiery prose of Robert E. Howard, and other wayfarers on story roads of grandeur. I began to buy into his archaic, old-fashioned prose. McKiernan has great drive as a writer, rendering the story at breakneck speed. He surprised me at the beginning of the sequel to this one, for he actually jumps back in time to events occurring offstage during the first book. I haven't seen that done elsewhere. It's a surprisingly good read."
1,Not worth the time or effort,"This is one of the few books that I have ever failed to finish due to complete and total lack of interest. Sadly, there is absolutely nothing here to hold a readers interest, unless of course you are hoping to spot the next post-Tolkien cliche. I will give the author credit, at least he is up front in the introduction as to where his influence came from for this novel - and it shows in spades - but this is really a poor work, lacking depth in every aspect of the plot and writing.Just say no."
3,"good verses evil,again.","I've read the reviews, I've read the book. In this tale of good vs. evil, we see a king, his two sons, a dansel in distress, unlikely heroes, and your classic, although, different, the same villans as usual. Mithgar, the place to protect the king's castle. Warrows help protect the king's border. I gave the book 3 stars because I enjoy fantasy so much. My only disadvantage in comparing this book as a knock off of the Lord of the Rings is that I haven't read Tolkien yet. But rest assure as soon as I finish this trilogy, it will be the next book that I read. I'm always open to a suggestion of a 5 star book or series to read."
1,A poor carbon copy of Tolkien.,"Wow. Before attempting to read the Iron Tower trilogy, I thought that The Sword of Shannara could not be surpassed as a pure rip-off of Tolkien. I was wrong. Suffice it to say that if you have read Tolkien, this is a poor quality carbon copy of the Lord of the Rings not worthy of your time. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings, then read that series and forget this one. Finally, for those of you who gave this series a ten (or I suppose its five stars now) you evidently either believe that this series is either as good as or better than LOTR, or you have never read LOTR. In either case, I feel sorry for you."
1,"If I'd wanted to re-read The Lord of the Rings, I would have","Hm, I was pretty dissapointed with this book. Maybe his writing style is just not me, but I found it tired, listless, and highly similar to the Lord of the Rings in many, many ways.I thought I was going to be getting a rip-roaring saga, but what I got was a fairly predictable yarn about hobbits, by a different name."
1,Can I rate it ZERO stars?,"McKiernan came up with the idea for these novels while recovering from an auto accident. Not bad for someone on pain medication, but I didn't have that benefit when I read them. I was shocked at the blatant ripoff of Tolkien, intentional or not. All the wonders of Tolkien are there, in a pale, cheap reflection, like Scarlett's Tara, AFTER the Yanks got done with it. Frodo wrapped in the shabby green curtains. If you want a better read, find some of McKiernan's later, much more original work, where he uses this admittedly fertile world much better. Don't bother with this freshman effort. Read the original instead."
4,Very Good,I remember first reading this book when I was about 14 years old and I would read it on my break when I was working in the potato harvest in Idaho. It was great it let me slip into another world for a while and escape my dreary work duties. Throughout the years after this I have reread about 4 or 5 times and it has never gotten old for me. I realize that the dialouge is somewhat syrupy but hey this a fantasy novel I would rather read a story like than one of the sleazy sex filled novels like Terry Goodkind.
4,Quite acceptable,"Took a long to get here, since it was coming from Alaska, and I gave the wrong address initially, but it arrived. Was frustrated because I paid for expedited shipping but it was definitely not in a hurry to arrive. But it arrived eventually, in quite good condition - no markings or highlighting, cover straight and unbent, only one random sticker on the cover. Don't pay for faster shipping, a waste of money, but otherwise just fine. Would use this vendor again."
4,A Practical English Grammar,"This book is probably okay for someone for whom English is a second language. However, if you are writing and want to brush up on the basics again, a better book would be The Elements of Grammar by Margaret Shertzer."
4,right book for the middle level english study,This is a well organized book with good samples. But the grammar points are middle level and seem easy for the advanced readers.
4,Amazing book,"Despite to wait so much and to pay expansive taxes, the book arrived in very good terms. The book is very good instrument to learn English, its grammar and language in all aspects. It's a small book, and not so heavy to carry wherever. Thank's Amazon.com."
5,Excellent in everyway,"Everything was excelent, the price and the shipping cost... I've been looking for this product for a while and you have safe my life thank you and sorry for the late reviewing...I'm sure I will be buying some more in the near future... thank you..."
5,"Really works, can't find in stores","I also used to get sinus infections all the time and terrible allergies in the fall. Now I use 4-Way several times a day. Allergist told me once that nasal sprays keep the histamines from starting up. Haven't had an infection in several years now, and rarely a headache. Walmart used to carry, but I think they removed because there's also a 4-Way with decongestant and it could get confused. Or, it took up too much competitive shelf space. Used to buy it from drugstore.com, but they messed up orders and substituted similar items one too many times."
1,Way overpriced !,"The cost of this product has gone out of sight, it used to be 5 or 6 bucks, now 26.00. Have a ""fire sale"" and get rid of it, but lets not ""price gouge"" ."
2,One Bottle????,"I'm astonished. At the store this is $2 for one ounce. And on Amazon it's $25? This is a great product; it isn't even addictive as many nasal sprays are but for Pete's sake, it is NOT worth this price!"
1,Not as good as it used to be,My husband uses this everynight before bed. But this bottle does not work correctly and will not squirt out properly and can't use.
5,"When your schnozz & nasal passages dry out, this is the stuff!!","My first use of this came after driving from the Bay Area to Denver. Once I hit the Colorado border, my nose just dried out. I found this at a City Market in Westminster, and relief was immediate and consistent. This is non-medicated, and just for moisturizing, and for 10 years-plus, it's done the job, whether in low-humidity areas, working in a dusty environment, or on the London Tube(OMG, what a relief it is there!!).It's tough to find in stores, since most just stock plain saline spray, but it's easily ordered here on Amazon, or at your local retailer.BTW, I sent a few bottles to a friend who's a Londoner, and he ended up asking his local chemist to stock it....and their employees are now firm converts to it!"
5,4 way saline spray from Amazon,I use the saline spray with menthol every nite and it works great. It moistens my nose and clears it....
3,Derivative,"Of course, Hitchcock did the original innocent guy on the run framed by the mysterious bad guys (39 Steps, North By Northwest). This wannabe 60 years later falls far short of those classics. Hitchcock deftly melded humor and suspense, with impeccable pacing and clever plot disclosure.This is a humorless, overly complicated, somewhat slow melodrama with a standard, flashback ending that tries, but doesn't quite succeed in wrapping up the loose ends.Still, the acting was above average, the French scenery was pleasing and it kept my interest. All in all, a decent Saturday night movie."
1,bad movie,The movie was bad. Would not recommend it to anyone. I would like to remove it from my Kindle fire.
5,One of the best foreign films I have seen.,Beautifully acted and directed. Cinematography is also excellent. It keeps you focused on what is going on and is usually a step or two ahead of you. Great twists and turns at the end. Pretty flawless film.
1,"Bad plot kills the watching experience, despite decent production","In consulting we have a saying, garbage in, garbage out. That's not quite the case here, but close. The novel from which this is adapted has a terrible plot that makes no sense: a woman kills a pedophile, then, with the help of her cop father, disappears, leaving behind a husband she's known since childhood. Then she re-appears after eight years, only to be hunted by the father of the pedophile. What makes no sense from the beginning is, when she knows they're being watched, she still sends her husband e-mails (on Yahoo!) about where to see her and eventually meet her.The film does have decent production, from directing to acting, but, alas, like most French films, tend to drag a bit, so it's a good thing we can fast-forward. And it's definitely a good thing it's free on Prime Instant Video, for I wouldn't have paid a penny to watch it."
5,GREAT,The French version of the book by Coban and it is better then the book- of course it was filmed in Paris and was changed a bit from what I remember from the book- but a great flick with subtitles- really really good movieand the scenery Fab totally fab
1,HORRIBLE,This movie totally butchered the book. it left out some of the most important aspects of the story line. i first read the book and thought that it was phenomial and of course wanted to watch the movie because i thought it would be even better. i was sooo wrong! when i started watching the movie right away i was bored unlike when i started the first page of the book i was hooked. how many books can do that? the producer of this movie did the most horrifing job of recreating such a wonderful and suspensful book anyone could do. read the book if you want the true and phenomial story of beck and his wife.
1,Long and DULL,"Please spare yourself the agony of having to sit through this film. It is long and very DULL. The acting is emotionless, the pace of the film makes you pray for a commercial break. The story is lame. This film was a complete waste of my time."
3,"Once again, the parlor","When a long disclosure is needed to solve the puzzle, this just distracts and diminishes what could have been. Agatha Christie did it all the time. Why haven't we moved on? Failure to communicate should have a better basis than provided the characters here. A much better tale was within reach."
4,rocking french mystery movie,"This excellent murder mystery movie from France is well worth viewing.It has a great blu ray print that stands out only like blu ray can.It has subtitles in English but that shouldn't detour you from gettingdeeply engrossed in this overall well written and plotted movie. This isn't a giallo or movie with gore and extreme violence , nor does it try to be. It is instead a traditional mystery that must be unraveled by a grieving husband and it's very well acted. In fact this is a French A movie and it shows with it's attention to detail. If you love mystery shows then this one is worth your time and money."
2,A most unpleasant film to watch,"Interesting story, BUT -- unless you don't mind seeing people tortured in unpleasant detail, SKIP this film. Too many gruesome scenes, and the film itself just isn't worth it. I finally turned it off after an hour & 22 minutes (with 50 minutes still to go!) The last stomach-turning torture scene was more than enough for me. As they say in French, degoutant!"
3,Once again...READ THE BOOK...,"First of all, let me say that I am a HUGE Harlan Coben fan!!!! Love, love, love his Myron Bolitar series. I was hooked after reading ""The Woods"" and have read every book he's written. If I had not already read ""Tell No One"", I would've turned the movie off. I guess it's just not my ""cup of tea"". I kindly gave three stars, because of Coben's talent for writing. The movie was a little too hard to follow, in my opinion. The book is excellent..love all the twists in the plot and ending. READ THE BOOK....FIND HARLAN COBEN IN THE MOVIE!!!"
4,why was this not made in usa?,"Harlan Coben is a master writer. Better than Grisham, Clancy, and Slaughter. His novel Tell No One is very exciting.How come we end up with a French version? not USA? Being English living in USA I naturally dislike all things frog/francais. It was good when Americans stopped eating ""French Fries"" during early stages of Bush's crazy Iraq war.Still, this is a good film. They cannot ruin a great suspense tale, and they did nudity better than Hollywood. Only complaint is if you watch the alternate English version the voice synch is poor. Better to watch the Frenchand subtitles.You will not work it out.Recommend."
2,...not even the audience!,"A tight thriller, and well worth checking out. However...the central premise is decidedly flawed as are some of theconvoluted explanations to the mysteries that surround ourhero. These explanations are wholly unsatisfactory, as muchas the denouement; in sum, they are quite unbelievable.This reviewer is not familiar with the novel, but it beggarsbelief that the author would echo Chandler and be unsure asto who killed who and why.And on that note: why was the hero's wife's best friend killed?How did the rich-man-in-the-big-house know when to have the hero'scomputer hacked? How come the bent cop who was supposedly sogood at being bent not cover up the murder of the rich-man-in-the-big-house's son? How could the wife pretend to be dead for solong and live with herself for the grief it caused?Actually, I really can't be bothered working it out, find outfor yourself..but don't tell anyone, you never know who's watching!"
4,Good Flick,Excellent story line unfortunately the film is in subtitles and in some places the plot line is difficult to follow due to the fact there is no english soundtrack.When you think the film is over there is a little additional sub plot which adds to the sorylineThe colour photography and the sountrack are excellent.Definitely worth a view
2,SLOWWWWW,"For a thriller, it sure dragged at times. (I kept checking my watch to see what time it was--that's how slow it was.) I think the reason for this was because it was way too talky--even for a thriller. One thing I like about Hitchcock films was that they were never talky. His films focused more on the character's behavior than speech. All I can say was that I was glad when this movie was over. TELL NO ONE reminded me of CACHE although I thought CACHE was a lot better."
4,Keeping schtum,"TELL NO ONE is a complex thriller cum poignant love story. Canet employs typical European tropes to produce a piece of nicely understated cinema that neatly avoids Hollywood excesses. We follow a grieving man's descent into turmoil when his long-dead wife appears to make an enigmatic reappearance. The small-scale action is always impressive and the bursts of violence shocking in their realism. The actors are equally effective at portraying everyday, believable characters placed in extraordinary circumstances. My only criticisms are that the plot is perhaps too convoluted and the resolution somewhat implausible. That said this is a successful puzzler that will keep you guessing and entertained throughout."
4,Solid French Fugitive-style thriller,"3.8 starsWe enjoyed this one but it could easily lose twenty minutes and be a much better movie. It benefits in some ways from its rather languid Euro-pace, but as a thriller it could be a fair bit tighter. The performances are good as is the direction, but the script is both overly opaque and unsatisfying in its explication; too few details are given at first so that the outcome feels unsatisfying, to us at least.It was a pleasant summer evening's diversion with the dog and cat at our feet, though, so no major complaints other than it started to drag about an hour in. Less romance and more backstory, please...and for a French film, this has one of the sappiest Hollywood endings of all time. But Cluzet is good and there are so many fine shots of Paris that it's well worth a gander."
5,Love this film!,"We originally saw this film as part of an independent film series at our local theater. It was hard to figure out exactly what happened, and we just couldn't stop talking about all the plot twists. Next we found the book that the screen play was based on and, amazingly enough, it was pretty true to the book. I made notes while reading to get the chronology right, then compared notes with my partner after he read it. And, finally, we watched the film again at home. Knowing the story made the second viewing totally understandable. It is worth the effort to know all the twists, connections and intrigue in this complicated story. The English language is dubbed and doesn't always match the closed captioned printed dialog. Read the story ahead of time and it will all make sense."
3,"Great start, lacking somewhat...","Book is vividly written with sometimes hard to read details of sexual abuse.. I could actually feel the emotions from the characters and felt drawn into the story. That was the greatest part.... when Anne was raped you felt her horror, the shock and the betrayal.. It actually made me tear up....Now the bad.... I felt it dragged on and on in the middle, at times it was pointless and pretty dull. I thought the heroine could've had her HEA little sooner so that we as the readers could have seen her happy. This book was draining, however worth every minute I spent on it."
5,A Brave Herione,"This is truly my favorite novel. Much of my admiration for this novel is centered around the herione of the novel, Anne. A lonely motherless child that was sexually abused by her uncle becomes a smart but empty woman. We might not agree with all the choices she has made but we can't blame her either considering all that has happened to her. We eagerly await how her family will react to having her appear after 25 she ran away from home. And we are disappointed that they still deny her accusation. A truly inspiring novel for those who have been beaten yet survives nonetheless. I highly recommend this book."
5,Sleeping Beauty: A Novel,"Great read. Convincing characters, plausible plot, interesting setting, story moves right along. I had trouble putting it down."
4,good for the price,"These pillows are pretty good for the price. Yes, they do get flattened, but I have a few of them together in different colors on the couch and they are decorative and comfortable. They are very soft and look great together. I may get more because of the great price. So far I have not had any come apart at the seams. My cat tends to be rough on pillows by chewing and scratching and so far my similar pillows with the fringe are his favorite, but these ones have lasted nicely."
2,pros: soft and cheap cons: quickly lumpy,i bought these to get me through just the fall season and they won't make it. i've had them three weeks and they look horrible. very lumpy. they feel soft and squishy and they were cheap so that's the reason they get two stars instead of one.
3,Arlee Woven Chenille Pillows shed fibers,"A good price for a set of aesthetically pleasing and soft-to-the-touch pillows, but the main problem I noticed with these pillows is that they shed little hair-like fibers all over the place when moved or touched. I recommend getting pillow covers for them--unless one doesn't mind getting little fibers on their clothing, furniture and/or in their hair."
1,Poorly made,"Do not buy these pillows.I bought 4 of these and after 1 week of getting them they have lost there shape and are falling apart at the seems. I had read other reviews before purchasing them, but thought for the price they can't be that bad, but they are. Save your money and buy another pillow because these are horrible. I would never purchase these again."
1,Terrible Pillows,I bought 4 of the Chenille pillows and they have all came apart at the seams. The lasted maybe a couple of months. These pillows are for looks only not ever to be used.
3,Good Supplement to The Book,Whether you read or didn't read the 9/11 Commission report this movie is a interesting watch. The movie is either a supplement to book and all it's details or a good summary of what the commission found. What lead to the events of 9/11 need to be understood and remembered. Already America is beginning to forget and this movie can act to renew those memories and make us realize how much 9/11 impacted our lives.
1,Laughable,"Follows a couple of Arab ""terrorists"" as they take flight lessons and are investigated by an FBI agent. Does not address the fact that this was the cover story for the inside job of 9/11. Also has nothing about the 9/11 Commission Report itself and it's errors, omissions, and lies."
4,An Intro to Getting Back In Shape,"I'm slender but not fit. I bought this DVD upon its debut and have used it on and off for the past 3 years. This DVD is great for easing you in to a fitness regimen. It's not tough, although it has its moments. There's a point where she has you do lunges, wall sits, and yoga lifts but there are few repetitions. Thus it feels like an introduction to what you should aspire to when you are ready for the next level. Overall, it's a great DVD to loosen up your tight joints and to be able to feel your toes again. As for her presentation, I enjoy her positivity because I really hate working out."
2,Way to easy,"For someone who has been a couch potato for the last couple of years - I wanted to get back into shape. I heard about Pilates and wanted to try a DVD, but also get some aerobics in as well. The concept of this video was good (mixing yoga, pilates and a little dance) but for the price - way too short and way too easy. In about 3 sessions I could complete the full workout and was often bored by the time the ""Soul"" part came on.I am used to Denise's ""enthusiasm"" so she did not bother me in that way.All in all - good DVD if you are REALLY out of shape and want to get started/"
2,Not what I expected,"While I did sweat some during this workout, I think it was more from laughing than working. I don't think the warm up was adequate and whenever she mentions to breathe it is more of an afterthought than an instruction. I've taken a yogalates class for 8 months and thought this would be a good video to do now that I can't take the class. I was wrong. I wouldn't recommend this video to the beginner or anyone looking for a good yoga workout."
2,Did not enjoy the workout,This workout was a mashup of different styles that I didn't think went together well. The standing pilates section was fine but what came after just didn't go well.In addition to that I didn't enjoy all the talking that Denise Austin did. I haven't watched her more recent work so I can't say that she is still this way.I also didn't find it very challenging as a workout but I do a good amount of strength training and mat pilates.This workout tried to combine strength and cardio and did so unsuccessfully. For cardio I much prefer a Dancing with the Stars workouts. So perhaps you can use that to evaluate my biases. For Pilates I like Windsor and the GAIAM videos
1,video does not work,"I was so looking forward to this video, but it does not work at all!!! Very disappointed"
3,It's Not What I Expected Either,"This video really isn't a very good workout. It's not aerobic enough. You will stretch your back, legs, and abs... but that's about it. Some of the poses are difficult to hold (balancing), even though I'm in rather good shape (and ski). 40 minutes seems kinda short. I think she tries to sell multiple workout videos, rather than selling you one that is a total workout.I am going to see if Richard Simmons still makes work out videos... his used to be very good."
5,"good product, good value","These laminating pouches are super. I bought the GBC business card laminator and these at the same time. Pouches look cloudy before laminating, but laminate crystal clear. Works beautifully, good medium weight, very pleased with the products, highly recommend."
5,Very good product,Really good product works really well. Laminations sealed well and were very clear. Would recommend this product to everyone. Just the right size to fit in a wallet.
4,Tastefully done sex education DVD,"Comments: An introduction to the Kama Sutra positions. The positions, though they appear to be easy, take practice, skill, mindfulness and flexibility. The positions shown are not just the missionary position. The DVD presents challenging and fun exercises for loving, mature partners at any level.Pros: High production value. Attractive actors. Amusing behind the scenes bonus feature on DVDs. Excellent score inspired by traditional Indian music. Educational and accessible for all, including novices.Cons: None. Minor - female host was somewhat pretentious. The actors were generally attractive and diverse. However, one actress appeared anorexic. Overall a highly recommended video."
4,"Very clear, but kind of dry","It is educational, but kind of dry. The cover is so beautiful, so I expected it to be more beautiful. The couples are very nice."
5,Great great great,Quick delivery! Good quality movie! Nice nice nice! We just love it! Great for gift for both of you! Just buy it!
2,NOT inspired: RE-Hashed!,"Christine INGRAM IS !! BUT PUBLISHERS? NOT SO MUCH... this like another version[which actually was a COMPLETE ""pint sized"" copy of her The Complete Encyclopedia of Vegetables & Vegetarian Cooking] has simply pulled & copied what was previously published. AND i see yet ANOTHER COVER in 2011[hopefully, at LEAST, different recipes from this one!] SHE PUT TOGETHER A COMPENDIUM- WHY DISMANTLE IT?. ALTHOUGH,it might make a nice hostess gift, i would NOT pay list price for it ! Maybe better suited for e-reader short. they{PUBLISHERS} did this with Linda Fraser's work as well. caveat emptor !!"
3,It's just ok,"The quality is ok, not bad, not great...but the sizing was not what I thought it would be...the corset fits my waist, but the cups are too big for me...they are probably good for a C cup...I am between an A and a B and I usually wear a 34 or am between a small and a medium...Other than that...it looks nice....just not great because of the cup size. But I guess that's a risk one takes when ordering online, without trying the item on."
4,"Pretty, but...",Dafinitely way too small. Bummed out becuase I had to return it. Very nice ensamble though!
3,Want to return it!,"Not what it seems. Too small in some places to big in others, guess thats what happens when you can't try it on. Cups to odd."
2,"Did not like product, but satisfied with return","The product was not quite what I expected, but I got a quick return to my satisfaction. Happy shopping."
3,"great 1906 essay, sloppy 1994 edition","one of james' important extended comments on manhattan's street grid includes ""...her primal topographic curse..."" here, on page 73, is rendered as ""her primary topographic curse..."" editor! editor!"
4,glimmer of light from the closet,"""For years he was silent, sitting still while the earth spun, scribbling in the closet by moonbeams and candlelight..."" This is Jeff Pew's invitation to the world of Roxword. Sit back, let it simmer and glimmer in your mind's wanderings and be transported to a far-off land so close to home."
3,Bland,"Maybe it was me, but I don't think this is one of DG's better books. Jesse and Wade had the potential to be great characters, but I didn't get to know them. The plot was predictable and thrown together at the end just to tie up loose ends. I can't stand it when characters are made to do something that is illogical just to get romantic tension. If Wade loved her as much as he did, he would never leave her while she was injured. That's just dumb."
3,SAVES JUST FINE!,"This game saves just fine for me, I don't know what those other folks are talking about! On the other hand, however, the game is really just so-so and it gets repetitive real fast. So, if you're a really big fan of superbikes and really liked Burnout, give it a try, but otherwise, well, it's just OK."
5,Real Flame Heritage Gel Corner Fireplace,"I purchased the Real Flame Heritage Ventless Gel Corner Fireplace as a Christmas present for my son and his significant other.His words not mine were: ""We love it Mom...it is elegant; it fits so well that it looks like it was custom built into the room. Regarding heat...it heats a lot more than what we had expected. It has a beautiful flame. One drawback, it cost about $5.00 per fire because the gel is so expensive. However, we use it for special nights and events. We love it and would give it a 5 star rating."""
5,Give me more,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading all three of these novels and I now include James Cain as one of my favorite authors. I have not seen any of the movies and I was suprised to find that there is no postman in The Postman Always Rings Twice. However, the title is understandable once you learn that the story is based on true events that took place in the 1930s that did involve a postman. These are the only three novels of his that I have read and they left me wanting more."
3,Still reading the book.....,"Still reading the book. Just an OK review. Nothing special. I still like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" by Steinbeck the best of the American classics."
3,Surprisingly Mediocre,"I purchased this book on the strength of my love for the movies, and for once I can truthfully say the movies are better than the books. ""Postman"" is the best of the lot, but Mildred Pierce is the most interesting, if only for the fact that the gaggle of screen writers produced a Faberge out of a goose egg. The screenplay is structured very differently than the novel, which has a pedestrian (and seriously flawed) plot. The novel wants to focus on the title character's relationship with her daughter, but it's telling that the Horatio Alger story in the background is more interesting. I am in awe that a committee of writers could craft a masterpiece out of such indifferent material.My advice: skip these books and re-rent the movies."
2,Defective,"These look like good quality standard business envelopes. I bought them because of the recycled content. We stored them away for a few months because we didn't need them yet, and when we pulled it out today, every single envelope is sealed shut. (It was not stored in a damp environment.) Due to Amazon's return policy, it's too late to return them. Looks like these recycled envelopes are going straight back in the recycling bin. :-("
1,this jockstrap is garbage.,"I purchased two of these less than a week ago. I was pretty pleased with their performance - but as I went to put one of them on this morning, I noticed that one of the elastic straps had halfway ripped off the actual pouch. I was kind of miffed, and went to put the other one on instead, and I saw that the actual elastic strips inside the straps themselves had torn and were starting to poke through the fabric.Let me remind you that I've owned these for less than two weeks. All I've done with them is gone running - no abuse whatsoever. And they're both falling apart after a single wash.I knew Under Armour was overrated but I didn't realize they could screw up something as simple as a jockstrap. I'll stick with my cheapo Target brand microfiber briefs from now on - they've already lasted me over a year."
1,poor Quality,"Well, great for the short time I wore it and then the straps seperate from the pouch. One of the only poor quality items I have every got from UNDER ARMOUR. I wrote them and they will issue a credit."
4,Imaginative and stirring prose with a semi-predictable plot.,"This was my first exposure to Lord Dunsany and it was easy to see why he is revered by many fantasy authors of today. His prose is elegant and imbued with an unsurpassed love of language. From the very first page, as he describes a man walking in the setting sun of a mythical Spain, Dunsany's tale serves as allegory and dreamscape. Even now, I find myself drawn back to verses which beckon to be re-read.My only complaint is with the ending. There is a point wherein I found myself cringing and asking myself, 'why doesn't the hero know this? It's obvious what the result will be!' and of course my prediction came to pass. However, this cookie cutter plot point was rescued by the fact that after that event, we see what becomes of the ""villain"" and how in his own way, he is as sympathetic a character as any we could hope to meet. To say more would give away too much.All in all, it was a very enjoyable read and well worth a look."
1,Paradise Lost,My husband and I were so looking forward to seeing this video as we love Naples. The production quality was very poor: pictures not sharp and not very interesting-lettering for credits looked tacky. The video is only about 35/40 minutes so not much time is spent on any of Naples attractions which gave it a very choppy feel. I doubt we will watch this video much again. It had the feel of a Chamber of Commerce puff piece not very well done. If you would like pictures of Naples you would be better off buying a nice book of pictures.
4,what I hoped it was,"Since there was no indication what size this was I worried whether it would be the right size. However the inside dimensions are just slightly larger than 11 1/2 x 8 x 1. So I can put my papers in, have them handy and have a hard surface to write on. I was very pleased. I cannot find these in any store and the one I had been using was broken so this was great. I really appreciate it. I bought three incase I can't find them again for awhile. I am finding the clasp doesn't work real great, but it is a minor inconvenience."
3,Non-traditional yoga,"I have been practising yoga for 3 years now. I like the deep breathing and calming meditative effect that this type of exercise provides. I purchased this tape thinking that it would be along the same lines as other yoga tapes I have, but with more emphasis on the lower body. I was sadly dissappointed. The routine is fast paced with little emphasis on breathing, so much so that I would hesitate to put the word 'yoga' in the title. About half way through the tape I turned it off and resumed my yoga workout with my old tapes."
2,NOT Yoga,"If you're looking for an instructional yoga session, focusing on the lower body, this is not it. If I had to hear one more ditzy phrase about my buns (""C'mon! Tight tushies here!""), I would have...well, you get the idea. Denise Austin teaching yoga is just too weird and I couldn't take her seriously. She never mentions how to breath properly (essential to yoga), let alone when. If you're a regular yoga practioner, be advised that all of these moves are found in your regular practice.Basically, I really disliked this dvd. However, I gave it 2 stars because if you're into aerobics and pilates, you'd probably really like it and get a good workout.Someone mentioned that they didn't like the ""new age way"" that yoga was presented. News flash: Yoga is a spiritual practice that also involves the body. It's not an American workout that sometimes goes with meditation."
4,Yoga Buns,"I really like the DVD but it skips and pauses through out the DVD. Can I replace this, it was supposed to be new. I don't have my receipt.Thanks"
5,Informative and funny,"I liked this dvd. Michael Fremer is very funny and obviously loves vinyl. He shows you three turntable setups as well as goes over the history of the format. He spends some time in a cutting studio, and shows you his continum caliburn ($100,000) right at the end. The only thing I wish this showed was the rest of his stereo, just out of curiosity, and I wish he put discs on and played them. I suppose he couldn't without paying royalties, but still, it would have been neat to hear. (even though a DVD)"
4,The only and of cause the best game in town,"In addition to being a well respected audio equipment reviewer, Fremer is, no doubt, an expert in the vinyl field. It certainly makes perfect sense to learn turntable set-up from the very best. Unfortunately, the video is a bit disappointing. As a ""how-to"" guide, it skips some glory details -- several sections were cut short. It seems to me that Mr. Fremer was terribly bored by having to set up all these tables. But the details are exactly what the newbies need. Did I learn something I don't know before? Absolutely. Can I set up a VPI Scout all by myself? Well, I ""guess"" I could. From the perspective of providing info on vinyl, it did a reasonable job. But I certainly expect more from such an expert. Would I recommend it to someone who wants to set up his/her own table? Yes, it is only video I know of. Nice try, Mr. Fremer. But you can do better....."
3,Easy Way Out,"Having been away from vinyl for many years, I needed help in setting up my newly purchased turntable. Yes, there was at least 10 minutes of useful information. However, Mr. Fremer's battle stories quickly wear thin for me and seem more appropriate for a blog. I didn't shell out $$ for poorly produced entertainment--I want a brain dump from an expert that goes beyond what I can pick up in a couple hours of reading audio forums. The production quality reminds me of an bad '80s corporate training video. This is a shame, there are a bunch of newbies like me who want more information, but this disc took the easy way out."
4,This is a very neat game!!!!!!!,"At first i could not figure it out,but when i did it was great!At first i did not know if i should get it because it sayed 7 replayable action games,beat your score on 3 difficulty levels.I didin't know how many levels that meant.But now i'am glad i got it. At first i thought that you had to change the character your self,but you don't.You have to find them,at least you do as far as i have gotten. It is very neat,and fun! If you haven't got this game then you better get it!"
1,terrible,i hate this game it is very boring when i played this game i turned it off 5 minuts after i started. i strongly disapprove of this game
4,Great game but passcodes are back,We all love this game. The olny thing wrong with it is that you need passcode. We have a few games that have these and really who can keep up with strange 5 digit letter passcodes. But I have to say this game is easy enough to get back where you ended pretty fast. My kids enjoy it and thats who we bought it for!
3,My 8 year old loves it,My son is 8 years old and just has started playing with these handheld games (he was too young before now). He loves it! i highly recommend it for children ages 7 and above.
3,Crossfire,"Richard Brooks' novel about a gay killing in the military is switched to a Jew killing, but the victim is still pretty clearly gay anyway. Starts off great (the murder is rilly scary), but once the focus shifts to the (gay) soldier that's framed for the crime, it's Yawn City. Had Monty Clift been cast instead, with more Robert Ryan anti-Semitism and less Robert Young speechifying, this would've been a winner. 6/10"
3,Crossfire,I was a little disappointed in this film considering the caliber of the actors. I felt the story line was not compelling.
2,Ugh! No way!,"Ugh, I couldn't even get past the first CD.The music is awful, but I could forgive that if I felt that the songs were helping me learn. They just get in the way - they totally missed the point of musical learning, in that none of the songs present the language in a manner that sticks, it's just distracting. And the music makes it *very* hard to hear all the subtle intonations of the pronunciation.I took German in college, and do have a background with this language, I wanted a refresher course. This is NOT the refresher course I was after!"
5,A great way to start,"I am just beginning to learn German and this (along with a book) was my first purchase. I gotta say this was money WELL spent. A great introductory tool. The songs really make the German stick with you and some are downright catchy, even if they are a bit cheesy ( I wasn't expecting Led Zeppelin ). The accompanying booklet helps with any words that may sound unclear at first or are spoken quickly. A workmate of mine took 2 years of German in school and is blown away by how much I've learned so quickly. If your goal, like mine, is to become fluent you're gonna need alot more of course, but this is a great way to begin. Especially if you're stuck in traffic most days."
5,THIS CD HAS SOME VERY GOOD TRAVERS TUNES BUT..........,"I DON'T CARE FOR ""BEST OF"" RELEASES. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE ORIGINAL ALBUMS ON CD. ANYONE HAVE THE RARE ""RADIOACTIVE"" ALBUM THEY ARE WILLING TO SELL? IN MY OPINION,ONE OF HIS BEST ALBUMS, AND TAKEN OUT OF CIRCULATION. MINE HAD HOLES WORN THROUGH IT FROM EXCESSIVE PLAY AND I'VE BEEN TWELVE YEARS SEARCING FOR ANOTHER COPY."
5,poldor years,great cd of the old rockin travers contains the classic cuts life in london to snortin whiskey to heat in the street a great cd for new fans
1,Stay Away from this game.,"Waste of Money. i bought it, played it for about 30 min., then went to a game store to sell it. the cover makes it look so good. the graphics suck, i was expecting something kinda close to NFS (need for speed), but i didn't come anywhere near it in graphics or gameplay. if you are new to racing games, stay away from this one and get either one of the NFS titles or midnight club."
4,"""I told my wife""..............","I was left a stack of old records and found many Barry Manilow's recordings. I started to listen to his songs and appreciated the way he composed. I jokingly told my wife I was turning soft and becoming ""gay"" because I was appreciating Barry Manilow's tunes. While they are produced in a sugar coated innocent pop way they are expertly written and this book is a good primer of Barry Manilow's style. If you want to play his tunes they are all here. He is underrated as a song writer."
4,Manilow's Music,"Whether you like Barry Manilow's lifestyle or not, his music is moving in many ways. This anthology includes his best through the years, and the arrangements are full of rich sounds on both piano and guitar. I highly recommend this book for all musicians or wannabes who have been playing the piano for a few years."
1,I simply despise this workout,"I truly wanted to love it. It sounded so promising. But, it's boring, boring, boring! Once I determined that I was going to give this a full 30 days to try it, I found I could barely finish 2 weeks. I bought all of the dvds/videos off of ebay mostly, and now I have to resell. There's tons of floorwork, tons of needless chatter on Jills part, and no noticeable results on mine. I went back to BodyFlex, and also got the book ""Jumpstart Your Metabolism"" by Pam Grout and am doing alot of deep breathing throughout the day."
2,Take a deep breath,"Two videos with a total of 30 minute in all was my first disappointment.Then, in watching, I was happy the videos weren't longer. Very unprofessionally done, and BORING! In addition, the people chosen to demonstrate the exercises in the second video can't do them. . . why watch someone who can't keep up with the instructor? I don't see how that helps anyone achieve the proper execution of the program.I feel like I wasted my $30 - of course this could change if I actually committed to the program, but nothing in these videos inspires confidence in me that this is the way to go. . . the only reason I gave it two stars is that I think it's a good idea to breathe."
5,Great Christian Christmas Songs sure to become Classics!,"What a great gift to give to anyone! Several of today's best Christian artists come together to create this talented mix of old Christmas caroles and original songs. Cadet (one of my favorite bands) sings a great version of ""The First Noel"". Joy Electric also sings a hilarious ""poppy"" song about the necessity of ""Mrs. Santa Claus"". Matthew Thiessen And The Earthquakes finish up this great album with a slow ballad about the commerciality of Christmas, and its true meaning.In conclusion, this CD is a great addition to any collection, usable for a rockin' Christmas party, or just listening all year round to get into the Christmas spirit!"
1,Very Poor Quality,I have had 3 Littermaid litter boxes. This model is the worst by far. One week and the motor was dead. Plus the receptacle goes under a few tabs that allows litter to fall underneath. They need to scrap this model. Another note is that the sleep timer isnt very adjustable because it automatically shuts the box off for 9 hours. Youre better off with your own timer you can get at the drug store for a few dollars.
1,Couldn't Pay Me Enough,"That about sums it up. Couldn't pay me enough to ever buy this model again. Constant having to reset because it couldn't clear debris. Too much litter, too little litter, cat sneezed in litter box, you name it, this unit malfunctioned. To top it all off, less then 30 days of use, it dies, forcing me to order another working unit and paying for expidited shipping so my cat isnt without a litter box. Now I got to find a box to ship it back in, after all who keeps the boxes after you set up the thing?I have to rate it by star, amazon.com listen up, you need to over ride that. Given a choice, I would give it a negative 3 stars."
1,Quiter,I ordered the 9000 July-Aug. 2010.It started getting sluggy by the end of Nov.Now it won't push but about half way before it stops and just grinds.Called service andand found out product numbers that were supposed to be there were not complete. I can't findmy AM.EX. receipt. Apparently this litter box I'm looking at doesn't exist. Better check to see ifyour box has all required if you think a problem should arise . I thought I bought a name brandreliable product but apparently not.
1,Not dependable,"I bought the Littermaid Elite about 2 months ago so I would minimize the time I needed to clean litter boxes. I travel often for three to 5 days at a time and thought this would be the perfect solution. Now that I am ready to go visit family out of State for the Holidays I just checked on my litter box. Both red and green lights were blinking. After researching the handy guide that was included in the box, I followed the instructions and called the help desk only to find out they aren't open. They are only opened during specific times so if you have a problem you can't solve it. For the price, there shouldn't be these issues. I now have a very expensive litter box that currently doesn't work."
1,Garbage...DO NOT BUY,The new 9000 series of littermaids are garbage. the motor isnt powerful enough to force its way through a big clump. The older series like the 580 and 900 were awesome but Ive gone through about 4 warranty repalcements on the 9000 even having them send me slightly different models thinking maybe one of them were better....nope.... DO NOT BUY THE 9000 PERIOD IMO! WASTE OF MONEY!
1,Terrible Cat litter box,"I previously owned a littermaid automatic litterbox and was happy with it. It lasted a 5 years, was happy with that. I replaced it with this elite mega model and after 5 months the rake broke. Littermaid does not sell parts but after 5 months why should it break? This is a very flimsy, cheaply made model, and not what I expected when I purchased it. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Worse than cleaning a regular litter box,"This litter box is horrible! No matter what kitty litter we try, it doesn't work. If you fill the litter to the ""fill line"" in the box the rakes do not go through it. Then when there is even a little bit of wetness on the bottom of the pan the rakes get stuck in it. I previously owned an older version of the Littermaid - it worked great! I didn't plan on getting another cat, so I got rid of it. I wish I kept the older version and never wasted my money on this newer version! Also, because the rakes stick in the litter when it ""dumps"" the litter not only does it dump it into the receptacle it also dumps the litter over the sides. I would definitely rank this up there with the worst purchases I have ever made."
2,Motor is weak and breaks,The motor is too week to remove urine clumps that may be stuck to the bottom of the box. It will repeatedly bump into these clumps and burn itself out. We are on our second one and it is worse than the first.
2,The smell is unbearable!,"I purchased This model litter box from a pet supply club. It works as intended. But I wouldnt suggest this to be used if you have a male cat, or large cats. My boy would pee too much for the little motor to handle the large clumps.The other issue I have is the worst of all. The smallest clumps that break off arent able to be raked out because they are too small and fit right through the rake. You can use any clumping litter you can find, and no matter what you do, this keeps happening. So the small particles that get left behind constantly stink so bad. They tell you to recycle the litter in the box and just keep adding to it, and completely change it every so often, but i was completely changing it all the time to avoid the smell. All that work made it pointless to own since i had to keep doing all the work myself.Now I just keep a open litter box by the toilet, scoop and flush everytime i end up in there. much better system this way!"
1,stinks,"I had an older model littermaid which was not perfect but provided a decent reduction in litter-sifting labor.The rake motor seems much weaker than the older one. With the old one, used to be, I'd sift the litter and replace the receptacle every week or so. Occasionally i would have to ""rescue"" the littermaid because it couldn't cycle past a clump.The new litter box rarely cycles, ever.Another problem that I don't believe I ever saw with the old one is that the rake comes down off of a little ledge, rather than a fully-retracted bay. Litter can and will find its way onto this ledge. The smallest bit of litter will prevent the rake from coming to rest at the end of a cycle, so it will cycle again. It will do this something like a dozen times before giving up. Coupled with the loudness of this machine, this is extremely annoying when it happens in the middle of the night.Avoid this. Buy the older littlermaid."
1,Underpowered.,"This is the second littermate we have and the quality has gone downhill. The first one was great, the only problem being my girlfriend kept getting more cats and it was the smaller model so we gave it away and got the newer, larger model. It worked well for a few months, but then stopped scooping the poop into the bin. It leaves a pile at the end of the box which really annoys one of our cats and he takes it out on us by pooping on the floor next to the box instead of going into the dirty thing.Stay away from this model."
2,Elite Mega Advanced litter box,I am not as satisfied with this Littermaid product as earlier mega litter boxes.While it uses less litter it bogs down sooner. Littermaid should offer replacementmotors. The odor pads fall off.The hype makes it sound Great but the delivery is not there. I am still waiting fora good product as a resonable price. Mega advanced...I don't think so.
2,Really bad product.,"The LME9000 is cheaply made, underpowered and the metal rake constantly gets stuck no matter how much litter is in the box. The LME9000 Elite Mega is NOT a good product.I purchased this item after my Littermaid LM900 died after two years of excellent service. I thought that the LME9000 would be an upgrade, I was wrong. My first LME9000 lasted 3 months and just stopped working. I called customer service and they sent me another (after I mailed in the motherboard and $10 for shipping). Here it is seven months later and the second one died. I called customer service and they are sending me the old LM900 version as a replacement."
1,HATE IT!,"I hate this piece of junk. It works maybe 25% of the time. The rest of the time, you will be scooping and cleaning. Very poor design and not an improvement over the old model. Motor is way underpowered. Do not buy this."
1,150 dollars to waste,"This thing has not worked once. Something called ""elite"" and ""advanced"" should work at least sometimes. We paid full price for ours at local pet shop with unfriendly return policy. We are stuck with an overpriced plastic container with permanently blinking failure light."
1,a real lemon,"My original LitterMaid I got some years ago was a far better product. Although it was noisier, the motor was stronger & it hardly ever stopped working. This model stops all the time, and if I fill it past the first ""fill"" line, not even to the maximum, it still stops all the time. I use premium litter and have followed all the directions. When I emailed the company to complain about it, they emailed me a form letter telling me all the things I need to do to get it to work (which I already do). They couldn't have cared less. I have three cats & started using the first model to save myself time, which it did. I am considering just trashing this one & getting a regular litter box, since I am always cleaning this one by hand anyway. DON'T BUY IT!!"
3,"Some Good, some Bad!","This is probably one of the better of the Elite Models, though the rake still does not redistribute the litter enough on the return trip.Most recently, it appears as if my power supply has failed. I hope the company is open to replacement!"
4,It's OK,"I had an earlier version of the Littermaid for about 10 years until a small plastic piece broke when I was moving. I bought this one as a replacement and I have to say that my old one worked better. The ionic cleaner doesn't seem to do much of anything. The charcoal filters just stick on to the plastic box, not really filtering much. This model does seem to be a bit worse about getting litter on the floor, which just means I have to take a broom to the floor around it more often.I'd still rather have this than do it by hand, for sure! But I miss my older model. If you are looking at buying, my recommendation would be to try a different model. Littermaid has done better on some of their others and this one has features that just SOUND cool, without being particularly useful."
1,Beware!!! - not respresentative of the product line,"I bought one of these to replace a previous model tht was slowing down. It looks sleek and sounds great, but... the motor is noisy and seemingly weak. The pan is designed with a shallowly sloping end that allows the blades to leave material in the pan. The blades continually got stuck and the system would shut down. Within 30 days it would just die in place, and the motor went entirely. The tent that comes with it is too small, and very annoying to remove and replace when fixing the machine, which was basically every time the cat used it. I have used the Littermaid products since getting cats 8 years ago, and they have been great. I didn't bother to deal with getting this replaced at the store or by th company; I bought a model 500 for half the price here on Amazon and I'm back in business!"
1,It's a horrible nightmare!,"I got this machine, because my husband said: ""because it's the most expensive it must be the best"".It wasn't. The poop was there and it was in the litterbox. So I had to clean it up by myself.So we paid extra money and I had to clean up like if I had the normal litter box. My cat even pee on the floor. It was horrible tosee the way that box was looking. I had to clean it up 3 times a day, and besides, I had to see all the residues of the disgrace that the machine does.This doesn't work properly, so it will leave everything on top, with a horrible smell. If you can, don't get it.Save your money!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Terrible, awful, piece of junk!! Does not even begin to describe this scam! We bought one at Target...called Littermaid and they sent a replacement. The replacement is worse than the original!! Do not buy from Littermaid...these do not work!!"
2,New but Not Improved,"This is my third LitterMaid. None were good but the new redesign is the worst. The cover of the receptical will dislodge closing the recptical so the new scoop lands on top of the container. Packing tape will solve.There is one good thing, I've not had the unit jam. The previous models would get stuck if the litter was pushed up in a corner...We don't need a better mouse trap but we do need a better design for the self cleaning litter box. The first person to design one will be rich!"
1,I returned it.......,"I have had the basic Littermaid box for the past 4 yrs. and it just started to wear out. I have 2 cats and never had a bit of trouble with it. I decided that it was wearing out and bought this newer model. What a mistake! I was changing the container every 3 days instead of every 6-7 days. The rake did not get all the waste but got most of the litter so therefore the container was mostly litter and not waste. It is not made the same at all. I returned it and was able to find the original box and now we are all happy again. This new model really needs to be re-configured. It does not work. Don't waste your money, buy the original at a lesser price."
4,Better than old one,"I hesitated ordering this litter box after reading so many negative comments, but I'm glad I did. I must say that I like it even better than the old one which I had for many years. I think it does a much better job of raking and I don't need to clean the box and/or rake nearly as often as the other one. We have 2 cats and it is a life saver!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this litterbox a month ago, and have been dissatisfied from the beginning. Using the LitterMaid brand litter and other premium clumping litters, the rake rakes a ton of clean litter into the box (and under the receptacle, creating a huge mess), necessitating either emptying or removing the disposable tray every day or two (for just one kitten). Generally I had to dump the plastic tray every day, then re-scoop what was actually dirty to avoid going through a ton of litter. The litter area of the box is so small that my kitten could not get comfortable, and often missed the litter, doing her business on the rake mechanism or the sides of the box, making lots of extra clean-up work. The charcoal pads don't stick to the lid like they're supposed to, leading to more odor. I found this system to be way more work than a much more basic system and have quit using it. I replaced it with an Omega Paw flip-over box, which costs a fraction of this product and works way better."
1,"This product is garbage, lasted less than 1 year","Bought this at Petsmart about a year ago. Today, rake finally gave up, got stuck right in the middle of the pan, won't move forward won't move back. This product needs a stronger motor, same issue with the older models but I guess this company refuses to test its own products and learn from its mistakes. The rake gets stock on just about any clump. It seems they test this with mice instead of cats. The urine amount of an adult cat makes such a big clump that this motor cannot cope. There is also the issue with unused litter falling through the treshold between the edge of the pan, and the receptacle, making a nice consitent mount underneath the unit.Will be throwing out today. Done with this crap."
1,Like throwing money out the window,"We had an original Litter Maid self-cleaning cat box for nearly 5 years. We had very little trouble with it, so when it finally died, we purchased the new Litter Maid Elite, without doing any research. We figured our past experience was research enough - oh, how wrong we were.The Litter Maid Elite is a completely useless product. Ours, apparently, is afraid of encountering clumps. The rake will begin to move, but if it encounters the slightest clump, it will immediately reset itself. Once I manually scoop out the litter box, the rake will freely ""clean"" the box, but the self-cleaning function will then not stop - it ""sweeps"" back and forth 5 times, until it settles itself back into place, green light merrily blinking to indicate there is an error.I am now performing the function of the ""automated self-cleaning litter box."" Basically, I paid $119.00 for a box. Learn from my mistake - avoid this product at all costs!!"
1,Total waste!!!!!,"A whole bunch of assembly, I had to pay a carpenter to assemble it ... and he didn't get it right. Once it finally did get assembed, it has so many bells and whistles that I spend as much time setting and setting this thing as I did MANUALLY SCOOPING out the cat residue!If you buy this model after reading this review you are as brain dead as the jerks at Litter Maid who foisted this piece of #@$#$!% on unsuspecting/trusting fools like myself.How big of a fool are you? Buy this model and find out."
1,biggest waste of money,This is the worst waste of money in the pet supply racket. All it does is break the cat poop up into small chunks and run it across the litter while making a lot of noise. Total waste of time and money.
1,Doesn't work well,First one didn't work from the start. Returned for a second one and it kept jamming up. Used the recommended literr and didn't fill over the line and it couldn't even clean. Rake kept jamming. It's obvious that it doesn't have the power needed to do the job. Terrible product. At least Amazon stood behind the product and took it back. Littermaid didn't want to know anything.
2,Mixed feelings,"I have liked this product, except that it stopped working two weeks after I received it. Customer service was helpful and sent me a replacement. However the sensor is not functioning on this replacement litter box, so I have to turn it off and on every time I want the rake to move across the litter pan. I have to call customer service again tomorrow, so I'll have to see how it goes."
1,Beware of Littermaid's manufacturer!,"I am also an extremely dissatisfied purchaser of the Littermaid Elite LME9000, which is actually more effort than a regular litterbox. I've had the same experiences as many other one-star reviewers of the product: really noisy and it just plain doesn't do the job, although I've tried 3 of the ""recommended"" litters. I wanted to send an email to the folks at Littermaid, and discovered that the company behind it-- Applica Consumer Products, based in San Francisco, is responsible for a whole lot of bad products, and is engaged in a number of recalls and lawsuits. You may want to steer clear of any electronic stuff made by this company."
1,Doesn't Work,"Agree with other reviewers. I owned an earlier model which worked well, and purchased this one when it broke. The design has changed to the detriment of the product. If you fill with litter as outlined in the directions the ""rake"" goes over the waste and smashes it up making it more difficult to remove. If you fill it with more litter than recommended, the motor lacks the power to push through it and move the waste. Tried to solve the problem by buying ""premium"" litter, but to no avail. Three kinds of litter later, it still doesn't work. Finally, i unplugged the litter box, took out the rake, and started manually scooping as i would with any other litter box. This works best! Unfortunately, the price of the automatic litter box as compared to a plain plastic tray is ridiculous."
1,TERRIBLE!,I have used Littermaid products in the past and they have always been great. This one is terrible!! Don't waste your money. I'm using a $200 litter box and scooping myself. Amazon won't allow me to rate it with 0 stars.
2,Not as good as my previous model,"My first littermaid device lasted about 10 years. It was excellent and I recommended it highly to others.I was really excited to get what I thought was the new and improved model. I think the new design is much cheaper and doesn't work 1/2 as well. The litter keeps getting stuck in the grates on one side and I'm not finding it cleans and rakes the clumps as well at all. I have tried using more and less litter to see if anything makes a difference.I would prefer it if they brought back the original version of this device. For $200, I am disappointed and frustrated with this latest model."
1,Never again!!,"I thought initially when I got the original model it was a great idea, and the original model worked like a charm. I decided when it was time to replace that after 2+ years of use, to just upgrade to the mega....what a big mistake that was. The first mega I bought died 6 months after I got it...the motor just refused to push the rake and now the 2nd one I bought to replace the 1st mega has just bit the bullet for the exact same reason. My advice to anyone thinking about buying this is DON'T DO IT! You'll end up in 6 months wondering why the rake wont go anymore..."
1,This product doesn't deserve a star at all,"After having the basic model of the LitterMaid box for many years (I have two cats) and being happy with it, I thought the ""Elite Mega Advanced"" (what a joke) would be even better. Every other day I have to scoop out the box because the litter sticks to the bottom of the pan. And if I forget, the machine just jams up and stops, so I have a real mess to clean. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Horrible!,"Do NOT buy this one! It simply does not work. The motor is too weak - it struggles upon the tiniest of clumps. It often does not make it across. I end up just having to scoop myself anyway. I had the original Littermaid version that was much, much better. That one had a stronger motor and lasted a couple of years. This one is totally different. I am planning on trashing this one and buying a different brand next time. Too bad considering we spent almost $200 for something that was made cheaply."
1,LitterMaid Elite Mega Advanced - Don't Buy It,We were happy with the originial litter maid product and when it died after three years we happily bought what we thought would be an even better product. It is awful. We have to scoop it ourselves several times a day. The box stinks because the rake breaks up the urine balls and never really rakes them into the receptacle. It dumps more litter under the box than in the receptacle. What a mess. We are shopping for a new product and we won't be giving litter maid any more of our money.
1,Worst Product Ever...,I don't know who the people posting positive reviews are - I'm assuming they work for Littermaid or their PR firm. This box sounds like a metal garbage can being compacted and barely functions. Motor is far too weak and construction is beyond shoddy.
2,Poor Design,"I had the previous model for years and it worked great. I only purchased this one because the ease of cleaning (quick rake removal). That is the ONLY good thing about this remodel. I've only had it for a couple months and the wheels that guide the rake are already getting stuck. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, especially at the price being charged. Stick with the old model...it works far better!"
3,Older models much better!,"I have now had 4 litter maid units over 4 years. The 500 models(2)are both still working, the 900 mega lasted 6 months and did not clean the litter as well, the 950 elite has been in use 1 month it works, but litter gets all over with this model. I think it is shallow? I added a white shaggy litter ramp rug to the ramp and it helps. ( This was from my PURrforma litter box which was a terrible thing!) Since other auto box types were even worse, I still give it a 3 star. I do agree that the maker is not very cosiderate of the consumers, buy from reputable pet stores they DO want your business and will usually exchange a ""lemon""."
3,Litter Maid,"This is a very convenient product and a great advancement from the previous product. However, the motor is not strong enough to push large clumps of litter at times and I often need to help the machine remove the waste. With the new design, clumps of waste often get trapped behind the combs. Also with the new design, there is a substantial amout of litter that slips in front of the waste receptacle and onto your floor. On the plus side, the box is larger and the comb is better designed. If you have more than one cat, you will end up burning through the waste receptacles. At over a dollar a pan, this is a very expensive product to have and use."
1,"Piece of JUNK, Leave well enough alone","Original LitterMaid finally died and we bought this new 'Elite' unit and it is now in the trash! Half of the waste gets trapped behind the comb and has to be manually cleaned out. Then after two days other waste traps the comb and it quits working all together. I sent e-mails to LitterMaid and got a computer generated answer and nothing else. Then the rolling wheels on the comb broke off and LitterMaid did send out a new comb but by then I had had it! We then bought the basic unit (LM900) again and it works like it is supposed to.LitterMaid- Leave well enough alone, this new model is JUNK!!"
1,Poorly designed - flimsy components,"I've struggled to get the littermaid to work over 3 years. It has been replaced 4 times and I'm finally giving up. The product is made of cheap components that easily break. The device will not last more than a year. The mechanism jams so easily, that it is only a marginal improvement over a regular litterbox. The customer service is appalling. The last unit failed after 2 months when a small nylon cog broke in half. (When I told the customer service person this, I was told that by opening the unit to find the problem, I had voided the warranty!) Probably only a 10 cent part, but the company does not sell spare parts.The idea is good, but this product and the company is rubbish."
1,Mega upsetting self cleaning litter box,"I have a number of cats,, 5 now and as many as 8 at one time, and run 3 self cleaning machines, 2 older and a new 9000 version. all my earlier models had little issues, but nothing like this. I automatically ""manually"" have to go and clean it out, scrape the bottom and waste massive amounts of premium litter when it does a scoop cycle every day, I will go and get an older version or two from litter maid, they all worked, I did like the larger size but those metal tangs on the rake just do not cut it,One more example of newer is not always better,,Live and learn,, but learn from the unhappy reviews of all these customers, Good luck."
1,Go for the older model,"I purchased this, and it has NEVER worked.I had no problem at all with the *previous* deluxe model. So, after five wonderful years of use (with two cats!), I retired that one and was quite excited to try out the redesign with all of its new ""features"". What a mistake! Problem is the comb/rake would easily derail and then get stuck. It would then make this super-loud clicking noise, that would scare my cats from even getting near it.Needless to say, I have a $160 plastic box. I do NOT recommend this, but I do recommend the time-saving, albeit uglier, LM900 model."
1,Redesigned LitterMaid Made Worse!,"I had two of the original LitterMaid self cleaning boxes. I liked them quite a bit (some minor issues only) except that the motor died on each one right after the one year warranty ran out. When I saw a redesigned box, I thought it would be better. No Way! It is worse. First of all, the original was made of good quality, sturdy plastics. This one, cheap and flimsy junk. The ionic breeze thing does not get rid of odors. Most of the time, the rake gets stuck in the up position and sweeps nothing. When it does work. the rake reaches just to the edge of the plastic receptacle, but does not push the waste in. They give you 4 free receptacles. Great, except mine were all bent and so did not fit properly in the opening. So many things wrong!These automatic boxes are a GREAT idea, but I have yet to buy one that lasts (I only have one cat by the way) or that even works properly. For now, we are all better off scooping."
1,Dont waste your money,"I shouldve read the reviews first before wasting my time and money buying this thing, putting it together, then cleaning it out, trying to get it back in the box to return.What a piece of junk. The rake doesnt even go deep enough to rake clumps buried. It only seems to rake the top half of the litter. Then it actually breaks up a lot of pieces since it doesnt go that deep so you have to back and scoop after it anyway. Who came up with this design?? You would think that after years now of the littermaid being invented it should now be a super scooper. They actually made it worse than the previous design. The sleep timer is nice. Thats the only good thing I have to say."
1,Poor product design,"I would like to give this a negative score, if I could. I have never written a product review before, but this one is so bad that I would like to warn my fellow consumer. The plastic is flimsy and the parts do not fit together well so that the rake doesn't pass easily through the litter and makes a noise that I would describe as sounding like quiet gunshots. It clicks and cracks and makes pounding noises. I called customer service - they told me to clean out the tracks that the rake runs through. Been there, done that, didn't help at all. I am going to call them for a full refund. It's a total piece of junk - don't waste your money (unless you like the occassional relaxing sound of quiet gunshots throughout your day)."
1,terrible!,"Horrible product. Pieces don't fit together properly so it ends up raking litter onto the floor when it tries to clean. The plastic receptacles just make it worse and don't close properly. It's impossible to clean. Litter clumps against the rake, essentially rendering the thing ineffective at doing what it's designed to do. The whole thing is about 10x more work than just scooping the poop yourself. Ours said it came with a battery option - which turned out to be nonexistent. We called the company to complain about the multiple dimensions of defectivness and they couldn't have possibly cared less. Avoid at all costs!"
1,Laste only a few months,"Well, this is probably the shortest lived model we have purchased. Our cat seems to go in the same corner of the box all of the time. Corrosion on the moving parts broke the small pin that drives the left side and the c-clip disappeared. I cannot believe that they will not sell part for these units. Trash and I am sure that they will no longer be the recipient of any further purchase from myself or anyone else I can tell about it."
1,Very disappointing,"Very disappointing - past units were very good (I have had 3), but this one was nothing but problems and broke after 6 months. I would avoid this model, very disappointing - a waste of money."
1,IT FAILS,"THIS NEW VERSION OF THE AUTOMATED LITTLER BOX TOTALLY SUCKS. ORDERED THE FIRST GENERATION OF THIS PRODUCT ABOUT A DECADE AGO,AND THEY STILL WORK GREAT...THIS NEW VERSION FAILS TO PICK UP SMALL PARTICLES...HELLO! CATS POOP SMALL PARTICLES. AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE NEW VERSION CAPTURES POOP AND HOLDS IT IN A PART OF THE CONTRAPTION...NOT A GOOD THING....THIS NEW LITTERMAID SUCKS INTENSELY!!!!!!!"
2,"littermaid deluxe: good idea, bad execution","Although the idea sounded great - not having to manually clean out the cat litter every day for two cats - the littermaid comb is too weak to actually move the gunk out into the plastic receptacle. Although I got the deluxe, supposedly for multiple cats and/or big cats, I end up having to clean it all up myself. Also, the plastic construction is rather flimsy - the plastic piece that moves up and down covering the waste receptacle broke on the first day."
1,Poor ReDesign - Unacceptable Product,"The Elite is far from elite, in fact it is the ""Edsel"" of self cleaning litter boxes. The previous models were adaquate requiring little intervention. With this new model you might as well a buy manual litter box and a scoop. This litter box never cleans well and scatters litter all over my floor, the litter box is literally full of s++t most of the time."
1,Piece of smelly crap.,"Littermaid sent me this one after thier last piece of crap I bought came with a burned out motor. This one has a weak motor, and it fails to scoop anything. It's going in the garbage. Stay far away from any of the littermaid products."
1,Wimpy motor this thing is awful,"We started with the original littermaid automatic cat box. it worked great until something made it stick in the full out position after 2 years. We replaced it with the littermaid elite mega and that was such a bad mistake. first, the LEDs on the controls bothered the cats especially the blue one for the filter, and the time clock. why do you need a clock on a cat box. THEY CAN'T TELL TIME!!! covering those with duct tape helped, but then It just did not have the poop to rake a good clump all the way to the bin. for smaller clumps it would rake it all the way, but would also take a good sized scoop of fresh litter with it. weak wastefull, and a step down from the original. mega headache and not elite."
2,LitterMaid LME9000,Neat product but the cat makes more of a mess with the litter and it forms underneath the litter box so it makes more work for me.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I rate this item 1 star because there are no lower ratings that I can use. Read some of the other 1 star reviews for details of the problems with this machine. I have used two LitterMaid cat boxes for the past seven years and absolutely LOVE them. But one finally bit the dust and I ordered this new Elite Mega model as a replacement. I know, I know.... I read the reviews but just could not believe the product was as bad as they said since my original boxes were so great. Well, this piece of junk lived up (or down) to even the worst review! After suffering with it for a few months, I finally purchased a new machine; the older LitterMaid model Mega LM-900 and threw this new model machine in the trash. The LM-900 is a FAR superior machine and I am now quite happy with my decision. Suffice to say; DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product! Buy one of the older LitterMaid models... you'll be happy you did!"
1,Horrible Product,"I wish I could give NO STARS for this!!! I have to say that I have been a LOYAL customer of LitterMaid for almost 10 years and I just bought the LitterMaid Elite and I can not stand it. To begin with, you can not move the litter box without the top coming off. There are no latches to lock the top and bottom. It is MUCH louder than the older models and it does not clean at all. I still have to go up and scoop the litterbox every day. All the rake does is push the litter around and the poop gets stuck behind the rake. I guess that the only bonus is that the rake comes off so you can clean all the yucky litter out. The way the receptacles fit, all the litter falls out and I have it put together properly. I am so disappointed with this new model. I will be returning it and purchasing an older model. This product is terrible. If you want a good litter box, get the older models of the LitterMaid."
1,Horrible,"The last one of these I had died in under a year. The replacement died in less than a month. I'm getting tired of being on hold with their customer service, I'm looking at other options."
3,LitterMaid Review,"This is my 3rd, but I'm not real happy with it. The ionic cleaner does not work and it's almost impossible to keep litter from getting underneath the box, meaning there's more clean up time for me. The concept is good and I really liked the 1st two (especially the larger sized one!), but this one is driving me nuts. I really don't know what I'm missing by the ionic cleaner not working as it wasn't on the other models, but I am not happy about the cleaning. I'm pretty sure it's because the plastic boxes just don't fit properly."
1,Don't waste your money!!,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MODEL!!!! I've had a cat for 15 years and he's gone through 3 Littermaids. The first 2 were the orginial design and I loved it. This model is a piece of crap! It does not scrape the waste properly. There is nothing to hold the scraper down and really force it to rake through the litter and whatever the cat leaves behind. I'm searching for an older style model.
1,Worst purchase ever,"This thing is absolutely horrible... makes a ton of noise, wastes litter, scares the cats and squishes all their poop on the back wall. I'm sticking with the good old fashioned pooper scooper from now on."
1,Junk! Save Your Money!!!,"This is absolutely a piece of junk! I have an older model that works great and have had it for several years. Recently a friend bought this one for her cats and didn't like it and offered it to me. I took it to keep out on the patio for my outside cat. The prongs are too wide apart that it isn't getting all the clumps. The trays don't seem to fit right, so the clumps end up on the ground. It is just horrible. I have gone back to just a regular old litter box as the other one wasn't worth all the hassle. They need to go back to their earlier model and get rid of this one. I have never had a bit of trouble with my other one. I don't know why they felt they needed to change it. Probably so that they could charge more!"
1,JUNK!,"Ok, before I bought this item, I read all of the reviews. I was careful to only use the expensive premium litter and was sure not to fill above the line. However, after only having it about 3 weeks, the gears starting making a clicking noise when cleaning. Then, it started continuing to run constantly and wouldn't shut off. We called the company, and they told us where to find the reset button and how to do it. We did that and now, every time that it is supposed to clean the box, it not only makes a clicking noise, but runs 5 times back and forth (clicking down the whole track each time), instead of just once like it is supposed to do. Very annoying!I am very dissatisfied with this product. We have 2 cats and keep it turned off so that it won't run 5 times each time one of the cats decides to use it. So, I guess I have a $100 regular plastic litter box sitting at my house now."
3,"Good product, poor design, poor customer service","Worked alright at first. Very convenient for people who are not home all day. The receptacle is fairly small, and with two cats, I was changing it more often than I'd imagine. The piece all together is much larger than I imagined as well.It has recently stopped functioning. I called customer service, which was a nightmare, and it is still not working. When you call, there is an insane wait. The lady I spoke to was understanding and helpful."
1,It stinks worse than what it doesn't scoop,"We had two of the older basic models which worked pretty good...This new elite STINKS.....If you buy one make sure to train your cat to pee toward the front of the litter box. If they are like ours and pee toward the back the rake will not lift out the soiled litter... The litter will turn to drywall mud and stick harder to the bottom than gum on your shoe. The other gripe is it seems to use more litter than our old models,,,I think most of it ends up under the loose fitting poop trays...We e-mailed LitterMaid the company and thus far have gotten the run around. We have had it for about 2 months.."
2,Very disappointed,"I had an original Littermaid for about 6 years and it finally quit on me. I purchased the Elite thinking it was the same thing - NOPE! Very poor quality....I've had this for 4 1/2 months now and I am constantly having to clean up litter UNDER the litterbox. Also, the part where the disposable container sits is really flimsy and keeps coming off anytime you move the box. The rake doesn't always catch everything either. I am so very disappointed - I used to recommend my Littermaid to everyone but this new model sucks. Sorry!"
1,Threw it out and went back to scooping,"We bought this last Christmas for our one indoor cat. I was pregnant and my husband HATED (and often forgot) to change the litter in a regular box. So we thought this was wonderful. First off, it is big, and the tent we bought (from the manufacturer) barely fit around it and was a hassle to try to change the receptacle while in. So we stopped using the tent. Secondly, it was LOUD. Super super super loud. Like, my sister who lives in the basement was having a hard time sleeping because it sounded like someone was drilling in the ceiling loud. We followed the directions and only put a small amount of litter in the box. For a while, it worked pretty good, but at about 6 months, it just stopped scooping all the way. We cleaned it, and tried again with the same problem. So we're done. Don't waste your money!"
1,Litterdump,"If you are looking to buy this particular model, you should drive down the highway and start throwing your money out the window, because that is what you are doing if you buy the LME9000 Elite Mega.My 2 year old can clean a liter box better than this piece of crap can.If you purchased this model like I have, scrub SUCKER that was writing on your forehead like it was mine and buy the LM900 Mega.It is a better product."
1,Avoid this product!,"While this litter box looks very sleek, the metal rake sits too high and therefore does not sweep anything properly into the waste container. Since acquiring this box, I now have to clean the box daily, defeating the purpose of a automatic box."
1,HORRIBLE,"I have had the first model over the past 13 years, I have gone thru 3 maybe. Well my last one finally quit after 5 years so I got this one. What a bad idea. The new design is horrible! It is so loud, the motor is weak, it is constantly cycling until I go in and un jam it and that is if only one cat pees. I can't believe how cheap it is now.I am ordering the older style one and I am not happy I wasted so much money on this litterbox.Do not buy this, find the older model..."
2,Don't waste your money,"I went through 3 of these boxes in less than 2 yrs. The motor just doesn't last that long. It gets messy and yucky and loud very quickly. If you have more than one cat, the resevoir that the rake dumps into fills up daily and can overflow, so you end up scraping the bottom of the pan that the rake doesn't reach and cleaning out the dumpsite everyday. It is not less work than a traditional..Please look at comments of the Tidy Cat Breeze system, it is wonderful, I am steering you in a glorious direction."
1,Worst designed Littermaid ever,"This is a TERRIBLE designed Littermaid. First, the rake sits in the litter creating clumps on the back wall, so it won't retract all the way. Second, the collection box fits poorly leaving gaps. Also, the way the box assembles makes it much harder to empty.Compared to the prior design, this one is a complete travesty and should never be sold. If you buy this one, you will regret it."
1,No stars,This is junk. Do not buy it. The cheaper ones made by this company are fine. This one is awful.
1,Total POS. Don't waste the money.,"I can't think of one good thing to say about this product. I had an older model and hated it, too. Naively, I thought the ""Elite"" model would be better. Oh, how wrong I was. If you really want a good automatic litter pan, click the link below for the Litter Robot. It is twice the price, but 100 times better product (no scooping - ever, no filters or plastic bins to buy). Check my review of it here at Amazon (though I bought from the manufacturer)Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Beige"
1,breaks down easily,"This was a great thing ... for about a month. After about 30 days of flawless performance, the motor in this box broke down. Unfortunately it didn't just shut itself off, it would go to the center of the litter then stay there making a thumping, thudding noise until it was shut off. Meanwhile, my terrified cat was cringing in the corner.A telephone call to the company later, they sent us a new one for free. We thought that maybe it was just a defective model. Unfortunately that unit experienced the same problem. Now we are on number three, same problem. We have just unplugged it and have been manually scopping the litter.Today I'm reading reviews on other automatic litter boxes. I'll never buy a Littermaid box again since this has been such a bad experience."
1,great idea but a TERRIBLE PRODUCT,"I purchased a LME9000 for my 2 indoor cats in September, within a month the motion sensor quit working and wouldn't rake automatically. I contacted LitterMaid customer service who gave me a series of solutions to try, none of which worked so they sent me a replacement under the 1 year warranty. Within weeks the motion sensor on the replacement quit working. In order to have it scoop ""automatically"" I must flip the on/off switch manually. Not to mention the fact that there is no way to thoroughly clean the moving mechanical parts in which cat [...] gets stuck. Gross! This product is a total waste of time, money, and materials since they will all ultimately end up in a landfill. Save your money and scoop it yourself - 'cause you are going to anyways if you buy this."
1,this one isnt has good as the original,"personally, i wished i had gotten the other when i replaced the one that had burnt up/died. this one rarely gets all the cat stuff out of the litter box and frequently ends up behind the comb. i complained to the company about their crappy product but was given the run around. as soon as this one dies, its being replaced with an original type littermaid.. littermaid's are much better than doing it for ourselves, but this one sucks."
1,Piece of Junk,"I've owned three Litter Maids and had to return all three. Terrible, terrible product. It's not just that they break, they didn't even work well while they worked. I finally splurged on the Litter Robot and love it. It works perfectly, and even though it costs $300, you don't have to buy any special contianers like the Litter Maid, and it's also extremely frugal with litter. Over the long run I believe the Litter Robot is actually less expensive. Believe me, just save yourself time and money and get the Litter Robot."
1,Will last as long as the warranty,"I've been using Littermaid boxes for quite a while. I've had 2 of the older models and 3 of the new Elite. I have to say that when the directions are followed properly the new Elite does a much better job keeping the box clean. It does not clog as often as the old models. But you still have the litter spills between the container and the box and of course it also clogs some times with my two cats. The Elite is built far worse than any other model. In a little over a year I've been through 3 broken rakes, and 2 failed boxes. The third warranty replacement just arrived today. Between cleaning a regular litter box and dealing with the Elite I pick the latter, but when my warranty expires and I have to purchase a new box it will not be a Littermaid."
2,One or more steps backward,"I've been searching for an auto litter box for a month now. I've compared the LM900, LME9000, and Scoopfree Ultra. This one was one of the worst for the reasons below:- cheap and flimsy build and design- whoever designed the location and attachment method of the waste receptacles is a complete moron- the new rake is more like a plow, again highly moronic- taking a simple task and making such a complicated device, even more complicated than the old model, to complete it is just insane- the clock resets when you hit the power button (poor choice there again)- Littermaid likes to make many different products with different numbers and not even have proper information on their website pointing toward extremely poor support- the noise of the wimpy motorThings I like:- more modern styling- ability to attach the tent directly to the box"
1,Just burn your money instead!,"This hunk of junk isn't worth the ""product"" my cat puts into it. Avoid any LitterMaid product like the plague. Buy a normal litterbox and scoop because that's all this model will end up being! Don't make the same mistake I did! Would give it -10 stars but that's not an option with this feedback."
5,The Best Yet,This is the fourth Litter Maid litter box I own. The LME9000 Mega is the best one I own. I like the larger box and the removable rake. I like the improved raking mechanism you don't have to worry about litter getting in the tracks.With the new removable rake and raking track it is hard to over fill this box with litter.The Mega was easy to assemble. The only complaint I have is that it is harder to get the collection box out to dump than the other ones I have. But this will not stop me from buying another when one of the smaller models wear out.
1,total piece of crap,"This is a great product if you want to pay extra for something that makes a bigger mess. This thing worked ""ok"" for about a month, still not great, then the the rake kept cycling for 15 minutes in the middle of the night, and the thing ISN'T quiet. Finally the motor gave out now it is just a real expensive littler box. When it did work it just made a big huge mess anyway. I returned the whole thing in the box it came in, litter, crap and all; because that is what this thing is, a box full of crap."
2,Elite Junk,"The old, small, beige model worked like a tank until the motor died. It was much better than scooping twice a day. I went through about 4 of them in a number of years but the newer model was a disappointment. The newer ones can barely push natural waste and frequently gets stuck halfway through. Littermaid sent me a new motor because I thought I may have bought a dud but the new one was junk, too. I'm out $120 and I'll never buy one again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had an older LitterMaid and I loved it but after 5 years it died. This one hasn't lasted 6 months and even before that, I found myself cleaning it out just about every evening since it never did work very well."
1,Horrible does not work.,"We bought this machine figuring that it would be at least less work than the non-automatic litter boxes. And it isn't. I see people talking about expectations. Here was my expectation: to do less work. That's it. Yet this thing creates more work. When the rake comes through to the end it doesn't lift the panel up correctly every time and it get litter all over the place. When that happens its not easy to clean. Not to mention it does not consistently push clumps into the basket on every occasion. Rather, many times the rake gets clumps stuck in it and brings right back to where it all started. Or even worse some times the clumps get stuck behind the rake. The idea is a good one. I really wished it worked better and if its something I'm doing I'm glad to hear it. But I have tried now three different types of litter and they all do the same thing."
3,"They sent the wrong part for it, but okay for cheap black friday price.","It's a typical littermaid. Keep the litter at the right level and it works fine. Too much, too little, it won't work.The one I received had two left side arms which would have made it unusable. I was able to recycle the right side arm from my old one, so it wasn't too big a problem. Size is perfect and the ability to not scoop constantly after my six cats is a beautiful thing, so it's worth it to me. But I wouldn't have paid full price for it."
1,"expensive, but cheaply made","I bought the more expensive model because we have 5 cats. It was fabulous the first week. Then it started making noises...now it is almost unbearable. The trays are very cheaply made. Could be made of a heavier plastic. Cats don't like the ramp, won't use it. Very disappointed. We are on a fixed income and it really hurts to spend this much money on something that is so cheaply made."
1,junk,"no pun intended but this unit is crap. had mine less than a year and it failed twice. maybe because the advertise it for ""multiple cats"". I have 2. perhaps its cheap gears etc cant handle ""mulitple cats"". WHEN it works its fine.the waste receptical needs to be changed every day or two for ""multiple cats"" If I were you id look at a different product."
1,Bad Product,"I hate this product. I have owned the LME900 and I am exchanging this one for that through littermaid. It's a long process but might be worth it for me. The motor doesn't seem to be very powerful and the rake doesn't gather small waste particles, like urine clumps. There are a lot of design features that could use some tweaking. My advice is not to buy this particular model."
1,Flawed design,"A number of years ago, I bought this product. The first thing I noticed was a wire that flopped around. The kitten immediately pounced on this wire and chewed it up and rendered it useless within a week. The kitten arrived later than expected so the warrantee time expired, and the seller, Sharper Image, would not take the product back. I'm still sore, and have stopped buying anything from Sharper Image to this day."
3,Better than scooping every day,"This product is OK, and my cats are probably happier with a cleaner box. The comb thingy is a bit wide and leaves behind smaller ""crumbles"" but it gets the big jobs. However, with the No. 1 clumps, the motor isn't really strong enough to push the whole thing and often gets stuck. We've also found that it works better when you use very little litter, lower than the ""minimum"" line. This also saves money on litter usage. The thing is also loud. Also, we didn't order the ""cabana"" cover because the reviews all said it wasn't worth the money. So instead, we made our own cover (keeps the litter mess down). Cats aren't afraid of it - they usually run to investigate it when it goes off. The receptacles are expensive -- $1 to $2 each, so make them last as long as you can before replacing."
3,works great until it breaks,"Been using this one about a month, works pretty good but it is fragile and already making loud snapping noises. 3rd one I've had. I think it's the best thing out there. Just disappointed that their construction isn't stronger... the motor is wimpy too. That said, when this one breaks I'll probably buy another one. I just wish they were more durable."
3,Good purchase,The original one I received was not working so I had to call and pay to have them mail me a replacement. But the second one works fine.
1,Just Plain BAD,"My wife owned an LM900 for many years. As it was starting to get old and dirty, we thought we'd get a new litterbox. That turned out to be a mistake. I filled the litter to the proper levels but the motor seemed way underpowered and I ended up manually cleaning it more than the machine did. Ultimately, we returned it and pulled the old LM900 out of the garage. We've had that for 4+ years now, and it just died last night. I plan to buy another LM900. Stay away from the LME9000, even if it were the same price or HALF of the LM900, I wouldn't buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have used three different models of the Littermaid Automatic litterbox and the LM900 is by far the best. The LM500 is quite small and broke within one year and the new model ""Littermaid Elite"" is complete garbage. I have had it for two months and it has yet to scoop any reasonable amount of poop from the litterbox. Please buy the LM900 over the other models or you will be sorry."
1,Piece of junk,"I made the mistake of purchasing this item on the request of my wife. I have to babysit this thing constantly. I do not need the sleepmode where it sits still for NINE hours,collecting my 2 cats business. When it does come awake it jams up til I clean it AGAIN. What a waste of money i still have to clean the box everyday like before. By the way I use the litter recommended by Littermaid."
1,My Opinion,"I owned two older models Prior to this one.This thing is a piece of Sh*%! The older one may not have been perfect, but it was much better than this new one.This is going back!!"
1,"Good concept, but..........","At first I like this and was happy with the lower maintenance of the cat litter box, and I was thrilled that it cut back quite a bit on the stench but then approximately the motor just died and it wasn't working anymore, and I followed manufacturers instructions. I found that if I just use clumping litter in a litter box and just scoop it out before I take a shower and go to bed for the night, that it is just as effective as the LitterMaid, just less costly. The concept is great but it could use a lot of improvements."
1,worst litter box ever,"This is the worst litter box ever. The stuff gets stuck behind the rake,every time he goes. The rack catches the plastic container and pushes it forward,then you get to try and hook the plastic container under the tabs of the litter box, with stuff stuck to the tray ""yuk"".The pam trick they give does not work. I had the lm900 model and it worked for 4 years, so now I have purchased another one, and it is working great. So much for trying new things.cpc"
1,As they say....JUNK.,"If you buy this piece of junk. It will break on you. 100% guaranteed. It is poorly designed and cheaply built. The only redeeming quality is that you will understand, during the 2 weeks that it does work correctly, what a great idea a self-cleaning litterbox actually is. That will then convince you that you should purchase another one that is better quality....litterrobot or catgenie or something....just not a littermaid."
1,Elite Mega LME9000,"I have to scoop the litter everyday. It smells good from the ionic spray, but it is not a self-cleaning litter box. I owned the smaller LitterMaid and it worked very good, the reason I bought this one. I am very unhappy with the Elite Mega LME9000."
1,A piece of JUNK!,"I used Littermaid for years and really liked it. Then I had to buy a new one. In the last six months May-November 2009, I've bought two of these. Both of them within 3 months wouldn't work. I took one back to the store and it was replaced. That one also didn't work within 10 weeks . The item is built of inferior material. The mechanism is weak and does a lousy job of scooping. You dare not leave it on automatic because if it keeps trying to scoop it will totally die and you can't use it again. JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!"
1,poor experience,I have had several littermaid boxes (which were wonderful - just wore them out) before this fiasco. I gave it a chance for about one month. The rake does not clear into the waste pan. The unit is at least 5x's louder than any of my previous units. I clean more litter off the floor due to the fact the waste box does not fit well and hold in place. And finally - the rake does not clean the pan - it continually recycles. I have already retired this model and gone back to the LM 980-
2,"it really sucks, but the litter-robot II is the way to go","I have had a total of 4 littermaids over the past 12 years and found that they are cool novel toys, but actually cost more time and effort and just aren't a win. A friend of mine recommended the robot-litter II box and this thing is the real deal. Looks wierd, rotates and uses gravity and a well thought out system to remove the used litter parts and it *really* works, dont really need to clean it, i'm talking like for over a year, no cleaning, none needed, that is amazing. I don't work for these guys or anything, but i'm now ordering a second one. They are more pricey, but in this case you get what you pay for.Peace,-chris"
1,Didn't work from day 1,"Brought it home and assembled it. It is supposed to automatically scoop litter after cat has left the box and it does not do that. If I want it to scoop I have to automatically turn the on off switch to initiate the scooping. Also, the charcoal filter fell out almost immediately. Now I use it just as I would an ordinary litter box. What a hunk of junk!!"
2,Does the cat go in the middle of the pan?,"My cat likes to urinate in the front of the box. The litter is not very deep at this location, so it sticks to the bottom. The rake tries to get through it but struggles. I have to use the old method of scooping to losen the clumped urine mass and then the rake will continue its job. The downside is that it is automatic. If I am unable to loosen it because I am not home, the motor will continue to run and try to clean the box."
1,worst ever,"I have owned several litter boxes and I bought the Litter Maid LME9000 because I have 2 cats. Well please don't buy this litter box. Wish I could give it zero stars. First of all it is very loud. You would think with the racquet it makes it would scoop the clumps of litter, but no. It gets stuck every day and once the rake stopped in the middle of the litter box. LItter ends up on the floor between the end of the pan and the waste receptacle. It's just a mess and I am going to return it. I will be reading reviews of other litter boxes before I replace it, I can promise that."
1,Don't Buy This Model! Buy the LM900 or LM500,"I suffered for two years with this model, which I purchased at a store without seeing any reviews. I had the same problems: the rakes didn't get all of the waste, it got stuck at least once a week, the plastic containers were hard to fit in and take out, etc. I lived with it, because I figured it was (marginally) better than scooping on my own. When it finally died, I came on here and saw the reviews. Because of them, I bought the Littermaid LM900 (because my cat is very large, otherwise I would get the LM500). What a difference! I've had it for three weeks now, and I don't even have to pay attention to it except for weekly when I clean out the receptacle. If you need the ""night turn-off"" feature of the Elite, which I did, just attach it to one of those cheap outlet timers for lamps. It has worked great!"
4,"Controls odor, works well, too much noise.","I keep this litter box in my room and you can't smell a thing. It does a really great job of controlling odors and keeping them tucked away safe and neat. I would definitely recommend this box for anyone with small living quarters or anyone who has to keep the box in a commonly used room. If you are going to invest in the box make sure your cats are in the habit of covering everything when they are finished. My friend had one and her cats don't cover so it didn't work well for her, everything would get stuck to the rake. Also, follow the directions as to what kind and how much litter to put in, or you can expect a poor result. My only complaint that I have is it makes a really loud noise and the sleep timer is only 7 hours long. I usually just turn it off when I go to bed and back on when I wake up, and if you have the box a few rooms away from where you sleep it shouldn't be a problem anyways."
1,What Happened?,"We have owned 2 previous versions of this box, which isn't bad for 10 years and 2 cats using them daily. This new model is pure junk. Doesn't scoop at all. Constantly jamming if it does actually catch something. Very flimsy, the door to cover the container broke 3 weeks after buying it. I thought products improved with age...not so with this. Save your money and don't buy this product."
1,A real P.O.S.,"Like several others, I ""upgraded"" to the Elite Mega from an older model. Big mistake. It worked well after I got the litter level just right. However, after a couple months, the outer edges of the rake rollers broke off rendering the unit no better than a plastic tub and a hand scoop. The company did replace one rake but after another couple months, the studs holding the rollers broke off and I gave up. If I can find an old model I may go back to this company's product but I won't buy any more of their new stuff."
1,Littermate 9000,I am disappointed in the product. I would not purchase again or recommend others to purchase. It does not do a good job of cleaning. When it is time to replace all litter once a month it is a bigger job than regular litter boxes. Now I have to purchase litter containers. It is messy and litter falls outside the container and the box.
3,Fore Warned is Fore Armed,"Basically I agree with all of the other reviews so please read those first...still I'm not so sure I would put it in the 'hunk-o-junk' category just yet...it still serves a purpose. For me that purpose is for long weekends and travel when you can't clean the box as readily as your furry friend would like. I'm not saying that the LitterMaid will clean it as often or as well as it should but you have a better shot at it than not having anyone/thing there to clean it at all :)My biggest problem with it is that there is no easy way to clean it when you need a full litter change - it is bulky, awkward, hard to get apart (and not very durable so you don't want to force it).It won't replace your regular litter box but might provide some relief for when you want to get away for a few days...that is if you have someplace you can store it when you are home."
1,Don't waste your money,"I also wish I could give this item zero stars. This unit has a very poor drive that strips out very easily. The older units work much better. I also have a newer one than this that said right on the box ""Improved drive system"". Sorry I don't remember the model of the new one and it's not printed on it. The Elite is a piece of junk that should be avoided at all costs."
3,mixed review,"I was very excited to find a kitty liter box that ""cleaned itself"". It does clean up the cat pooh but there is cat liter everywhere when the cat uses it. We finally splurged and bought the cover/tent which helps but a lot of liter still comes out the front where the tent opening is...guess you can't have everything in one liter box."
1,DON'T EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT,"If I could give negative stars I would! I had this litterbox for a little over a year and I have gone through 4!!!! Each time it broke, the company would send me another one, which would last a couple of months and then I'd be calling Littermaid again. To make matters worse, they have some pretty bad customer service. It is ridiculous how long I stayed with this litterbox. If you want an automatic litterbox- ANYTHING other than this product woudl be fine i'm sure."
1,Not self cleaning,"My husband thought this would be great, a self cleaning cat litter box, wrong, it makes a big mess, as shown in oneof the photographs, as the automatic forks drag the clumps to the disposal tray, it drops litter down the crack between the desposal container and the unit. You have to pick the whole unit up to sweep up all the cat litter that has dropped under the unit. You can spend more time cleaning up after the automatic cleaner than you would if you just used a regular cat box. The other draw back is the unit is very noisy. I will not be replacing the unit when it dies and that can't happen soon enough."
1,not worth the money,"As someone else noted the motor/rake is not very strong and sounds like its tearing up when it is in motion. When the rake begins to lift to push the poop into the receptacle it lifts up leaving a gap of about 1""-1 1/2"" leaving most of it (poop) in the box and what is left is now caught behind the rake as it returns to its resting position and pushing the poop to the back of the litter box squishing it into the rake.I wish I had never wasted my money on this. It seems I am cleaning the box longer (getting poop out of the rake) and more often with this ""automatic cat litter box""."
1,Abysmal Product. Buy the LM900 instead.,"I purchased this product after owning the 'lower-end' model, the LM900.This is dressed-up model has a stainless steel rake and fancy electronics. What it doesn't have is basic functionality.Waste gets caught behind the rake or left behind. It requires daily attention to keep a modicum of cleanliness. If I wanted to pay daily attention to the litterbox, I wouldn't have purchased an automated one.Littermaid's Engineers need to go back to the drawing board with this one. Fortunately LM's customer service was up to par. I called them and complained, and they sent me an LM900 (After I sent them $10 and vital parts.) The LM900 sells for less than this model, so I lost money on the deal but ultimately ended up with a functioning product.Bottomline: This doesn't work. Buy the LM900 instead. It works, and it's cheaper."
1,Can I do a zero?,One word: Crap!Pushes more litter out of the box than waste into the receptacle. Constant jams. FAR from automatic! Save a few dollars and get the older model LM900 (I believe). It works far better; I have had one for four years without a problem!
1,beyond disappointed,"I purchased this to replace the LitterMaid my cats had been using for 7 years - the wiring was shot - and within 2 days the litter rake began running continuously - it wouldn't shut off on its own and the cats became scared of the box. I returned it, got a replacement and had the same problem with it. I won't be purchasing another one. This is very disappointing as I was so pleased with the original and expected the replacement box to be even better since it was several years newer."
1,WARNING!!! Junk,Believe everything you read in the other comments that is negative. I never write reviews. This is a rare exception. I have spent more time writing on this now than it is worth. In the end it is a litter pan that you end up scooping the litter out yourself. I think the ionizer is a fake thing. I have never seen the light on. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
1,GARBAGE!,"Mine died within 2 months of purchasing it. Littermaid said they would replace it... however, I've been waiting over 2 months for my replacement. They keep telling me it's backordered. I finally got them to agree to a refund and I'll go find another box on the market that actually works longer than 2 months. In the two months that it did work, it constantly dumped clean litter all over the floor (it's like it slid down the top or something) I was constantly cleaning up large amounts of clean litter. Don't waste your time or money."
1,WHAT A DISASTER!,"Think 9 times before trying this item out. If you make the mistake of disregarding what seems to be nearly universal negative reviews and shell out the $110 you'd better keep your receipt. After you unpack the box here is what you can expect:1- You'll think, ""Man, this is a pain to put together.""2- You'll see how many different parts you kitty will be able to poop on.The next day you can expect this to happen:1- You'll find the collection tray filled. You'll have to scoop it or toss it.2- You'll notice poop and/or piddle collecting on and behind the rake.3- You'll notice poop marks on the housing of the unit, requiring cleaning.4- You'll be cleaning the unit and repacking it in the box to return it to the store.DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
1,From good to bad,"I, like many others commenting here really liked the old littermaid automatic litter box. I'm talking about the one with the plastic rake. It worked great for many years, then the motor went out. That was fine, I expected it to die after five or more years and two cats using it. I upgraded to the Littermaid Elite and it wasn't as good as the first one, but functioned. I wanted something better, so I assumed that buying the best product they offered on the market would improve the performance at least to that of the first automatic box we owned. Wrong! The Elite Mega was very problematic and after only one month I discarded it and have moved onto a new comapny. The PetSafe Simply Clean is now in our home and is working out great so far. The reviews on here were very supportive so I have high hope for long term success."
1,"This stinks, literally and figuratively.","After having this contraption for only 8 months, it has stopped working altogether. I wish I had just bought a $15 plain ole plastic box, and not spent $169 for this white elephant. Both red and green LED lights blink, and the rake assembly doesn't work at all. Their is no obstruction, and the manual does not address this issue. Don't waste your money on this."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!,"Having had several Littermaid boxes and normally loving them all this new one is the BIGGEST piece of junk to ever set sail on unwary consumers. It constantly breaks down, rake jams if the litter is not evenly distributed (and lets face it no matter how much you try to get the cats to smooth out the litter after using the box they just never do) we now just use it as a regular old box until we get something new."
1,This version must be BETA!,"I have had this Littermaid (LME9000) for just under 60 days (Purchase date was 8-22-2006). It was a replacement for an older Littermaid that I had for 4 years (give or take about a month).Here are the problems I have:The flimsy molding causes the cover for the receptacle to never close. It catches on the sides, so its always cracked open. So the ionic filter may sound nice, it can't battle that much smell.Also, since the rake doesn't have a fixed guide, it catches a lot even when its only raking through litter with no waste to plow through.The rake guide wheels are not so great either. If the rake gets caught on something, the motor is actually strong enough to break the wheels off the rake, resulting in a completely useless littermaid.I would not reccomend this model/style to anyone. You are much better off with the LM500 since its the older design and should be far more reliable."
1,Terrible purchase,"I had the original base model for a few years and then it finally died. It wasn't great and each week I would have to resolve at least one problem it couldn't deal with, but on the whole it was fine. So stepping up to the top model I thought was a smart idea, it'll be much better than the base model... yeah right!This thing barely touches the bottom of the tray so it will 'never' get everything out. It's design makes it 'impossible' for it to get 'anything' at the very back of the tray. The forward portion of the scoop cycle has a half inch to inch gap between the tray and metal prongs (yes, it's put together properly so the 'you should be able to read this text' text is under the tray). The plastic boxes don't fit in the area given easily so you have to lock them into place... this and the motor seems weaker than the base model...A total useless waste of money, resolving it getting stuck is now a daily operation."
3,has a few faults in design...,"Basically, I am happy with this new model, but the primary thing I don't like is that for some reason, the cats toss the litter out of the box so with this model, I find more litter on the floor than with the older model. I do like the fact that you can take out the rake and clean it where that was difficult on the older model. Noise is about the same. All in all, if I didn't already own this one, I would go back to the older model."
1,Not worth the money,"We have the LME5500 model made by this company. Either our cat has too much ""output"" at one time or this product is a piece of garbage. I think the product is a piece of garbage. Can't push the ""output"" into the container, then just retracts, resulting in my having to scoop the box out by hand EVERY time. Don't waste your money--there's a reason why old litter boxes (box with litter and a shovel) still exist!"
1,Terrible Design Change - Bring back the Older Model!!,"This newer model - Mega Elite - is a piece of junk.I was very happy with an older LitterMaid Mega from 2004.The ""fork"" on the older model was made of blades (not wires) and the motor was apparently much stronger then.Obviously I know how to use this product since I was a happy owner for several years.This newer model has severe problems with the motor quitting on the cleaning pass (lack of power to make the pass), and also with the tines clogging. The problems are severe enough that it's easier to go back to the manual method."
3,So so Litter Maid,"The item is doing the job,but it isn't nearly as good as the earlier 9000 Model.The ionized odor control does not operate properly.The preset function doesn't keep its setting,consequently the place stinks."
1,Design failure.,"I have used these LitterMaid products over the years with no problems. However, the design of this machine does not permit it to dispose of the material over the container but stops just at the edge. Therefore, you end up manually scooping. Checking the previous LitterMaid litter box confirms the DESIGN FAILURE.To return the product I must disassemble it and try to repack it. No easy matter so I am stuck with it. Unfortunately, I trusted my earlier experience with LitterMaid and did not read the comments when ordering - shame on me. I hope this does not happen to anyone else."
5,Great for my cats!!,This litermaid works like a dream! I have three cats and it accomodates all of them nicely!I would reccommend it to anyone who was inquiring.
3,Breaking Wheels,"I have just about finished with our second LitterMaid Elite LME9000 Mega. The first one, three months ago, broke off the left wheel of the steel litter rake carrier after about two months of use. Neither the Pet Shop nor the Manufacturer Web Site had provisions for ordering a replacement rake, carrier or wheel fixtures for repairs. We put that one in the trash and coughed up another $150.00 for the second. That one just broke off the wheel on the same side, after two months use, putting the rake out of comission.There is no support. The machines do not last long.Good luck with whichever one you purchase."
1,"new, not better","I have had the old style littermaids for years and loved them. You can't buy them a t petco and petsmart anymore, so I tried the this one and put my old one in the basement. Now the cats go to the basement to use the old one. this one is so lame, doesn't clean, no power. I was constantly scooping. I wrote to the company and got some lame form letter in reply which showed me they didn't even read it. this is going in the trash and I'm getting another old type."
1,Worst purchase decision I've made,"I threw this litter box away after 3 weeks. Containers don't fit properly so waste falls beneath or between sides; rake gets caught and dirty; motor, while weak, is incredibly loud...I ended up scooping the box, as normal, but cleaning a greater mess than I ever had with plain litter box...turned me back into the ""litter maid""."
3,I'd really like to be involved in designing the perfect litter box.,"I was really hoping this would work better than it does. It doesn't help that my cats kick the litter so it ends up on the lid of the waste bin so when it lifts, it gets dumped on the ramp. The waste bin is way too small and there is too much litter that ends up under the unit."
3,Murders that shouldn't have been investigated,"My single biggest difficulty with this book is that when all is said and done, everybody would have been a lot better off if our heroine, Desiree Shapiro, had simply left well enough alone, and NOT investigated. In fairness to the plotting, at each step of the way investigating looks like the reasonable thing to do. This makes it much easier to take than some mysteries where the investigator is finding out what happened for sheer nosiness. Desiree Shapiro is an interesting person, funny, self-deprecating, very ethical at the oddest times, and I will probably read more of this series. I just wish that I hadn't gotten to the end of the book, and decided that everyone would have been better off if Desiree had been in Timbuktu for the week."
3,Good mind candy for a hot summer's day.,"Desiree Shapiro was new to me and I found I enjoyed her humor and writing style. The plot was a little thin, but made up for in amusement.There are two kinds of books; those that you just want to curl up and read, and those that you can read while doing 4 other things. Desiree Shapiro is an excellent book to occupy your mind while exercising."
5,A fine western,"This was an excelent western. Kept me entertained throughout the movie. The settings were wonderful. Along with Kris Kristofferson, Wille Nelson, Travis Tritt and Waleon Jennings (small part) add fine acting to the movie. I highy recommend this movie to fans of westerns."
4,A great movie,"Outlaw Justice is a wonderful look at the age of outlaws along the lines of Lonesome Dove or The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean. Humorous and endearing, serious and artistic, Outlaw Justice presents some of the most colorful characters from the ""Outlaw"" period of Country music in roles that they were made to play. Down sides include a lack of a letter box format and a lack of a menu system which leave the movie with 4 stars...otherwise it is a 5 star preformance!"
5,Outlaw Justice,"Not a grammy winner but if you like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Travis Tritt and Kris Kristofferson, you will like this movie. It is entertaining. A really enjoyable DVD with some great one liners."
3,songwriter,"amazon is a great place to receive all your old dvd you dontwait long and deliverley,is greati look on amazon first to makesure i can order from them on any thing i need"
1,Not a very good CD,"I was disappointed with the quality of this CD. The Jan & Dean section is OK, but the Beach Boys section is very poor. It doesn't sound at all like the group. I do not recommend it."
3,relax it is Jan and Dean and The Beach Boys,"This is a an assortment of The Beach Boys ""Hite"" days Surfin,Surfer Girl,Judy,Karate are from those early sessions (they contain no jan and dean).Drag City is most likely from a rare promo album I think it was called ""The beach boys do NASCAR?"" which has Mike love singing lead with some Dean Torrance. Jan and Dean in the sixties covered ""Little deuce coupe"" on a earlier Liberty Records album. Of course Brian sang on Surf City. So there you have it...The beach Boys and Jan and Dean never recorded an album together. This an assorted collection from about four different albums that someone had the rights to release the tracks. Hope this helps..."
2,Missing an essential spring,"This set, although Amazon verified that it would fit my 2006 Toyota Corolla's rear drum brakes, is missing an essential spring.Also, the springs are not exact replacements for the springs in my car. The large green and yellow springs are very different than the ones in my car. It appears to me that this is a generic spring set, not specific to the Corolla.On top of that I waited too long to return the springs--my bad. But overall a very, very disappointing purchase from Amazon!Otherwise, the springs appear to be of good quality, hence I'll give it two stars. If it were poor quality, and missing the spring, one star would be too many."
4,Sugar Creek Gang Mysteries,Our grandson is just at the age he can read these books and he really enjoys reading. The mysteries keep the suspence going and the lessons taught are a rare find these days. The books arrived in excellent condition and a timely manner.
2,When good books go bad,"This book starts out very well, with some good, specific information. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. The author makes a point of qualifying herself by saying she had fallen victim herself, and that's where the problem lies. The book starts out objectively, but quickly turns subjective with the author's feelings and bitterness leaking through and coloring her information. Am I sorry I bought it? No. It fits well into my extensive collection on con artists. Would I recommend it for the casual reader? No, or at least not without a big grain of salt."
1,Does not live up to the basketball diaries,"I wanted this book because this was the supposed ""sequel"" to the basketball diaries. when i started to read it i was expecting stories of what he was doing at the time such as doing drugs commiting crimes and stuff like that. in this book all i get is crap about his sex life. that's why i gave up on it and i don't intend on reading it again."
5,HE JUST WANTS TO BE PURE,"Jim Carroll's second autobiography has a unique power to trap your mind and you have no choice but to keep on reading. In these diaries Jim is more older than in TBD. His vision is stronger, his personal entries are amazing...from racing crabs ""the tiny parasites of crotch.""-JCpg.4 with Patti Smith to going to poetry readings with Bob Dylan and his retreat to Bolinas CA to kick his heroin habit. Forced Entries is truly a masterpice from the gratest living poet of our time. His work is truly eternal."
3,IN REALISTIC WORLD OF THE ADDICTION OF DRUG ABUSE WHILE STILL FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS,THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD BUT I MUST SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO READ THE FIRST BOOK ( BASKETBALL DIARIES ) BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE ITS A CONTINUATION. THE FIRST BOOK HE IS STILL IN HIS YOUTH YEARS AND HE IS BASICALLY JUST RUNNING WILD AND GETTING HIGH AND AS THE BOOK GOES ON HE REALIZES THAT HE IS VERY GIFTED AND 2ND BOOK HE IS STILL GETTING HIGH AND IS FOLLOWING HIS DREAMS AND REALIZES THAT HE CANT DO BOTH TO SUCCEED. I DID ENJOY BOTH BOOKS BUT DID LIKE THE FIRST BOOK BETTER. IF YOU ENJOYED THE IN DEPTH REALNESS OF THE MOVIE THE BASKETBALL DIARIES THEN THESE 2 BOOKS ARE MUST READS
4,Great book,"This was a great book. I bought it for my son, and read it first to check the content. Other than the 12 year old boys sneaking out of the house, the content was all positive. Great to find a book whose characters are good examples and the adults are not made to look foolish."
5,Newspaper Caper,"My older two boys who are 8 and 10 years old LOVED these books. I have one boy who doesn't like to read, but it was easy getting him to read everyday with this series of books! They would come tell me everything that happened in the part they read that day. I'm so glad I found an adventure that they like to read and isn't harsh on their little minds."
4,reggae you got to try,"the first time I heard tony b was on a sizzla compilation and I thought he was pretty good but as time has gone by his music has gotten better and better.even my dad,who only really likes some of the older artists like marley and tosh,burning spear,jimmy cliff etc. ,really likes this cd.it just spans all the various reggae sounds so well."
1,do not use wella white lady,"I used because I had read a recommendation on another forum from a licensed cosmetologistwho said it was the best to get platinum blond look. My hair ended up darker than beforei used it. It turned what what I would call a ""dirty blonde"". Do not recommend!!!"
5,A book about Jesus by a man who loves Jesus.,"Peter Jensen puts Jesus Christ in the centre of God's plans. This is not quite correct; the Bible puts Jesus in the centre of God's plans and Jensen just reports on it. If you accept the Bible as being the Word of God you will probably enjoy this book, if you do not accept the Bible as the Work of God you will certainly not like this book."
4,Good book for preparing for the test.,"The book was easy to read with lots of diagrams to assist you while building kits. The questions at the end of the chapters were too easy, and some conflicted what the book said. An example of one error can be found on page 190, it says a corporate admin can use multiple floppy disk - yet on page 218 the diagram states the opposite - which is it guys? Overall the errors are few, unlike some of the competition. I would recommend this book for those taking the IEAK test. The only down side as some have mentioned is that the Beachfront Quizzer stinks. The diagrams are out of order and the questions are really basic. Don't rely on them for the test!"
2,"Not Impressive, too much detail in the WRONG places.","I am an MCSE+Internet, CIW-A, A+, Network+, I-net+ professional.I read the book cover to cover, practiced all of the exercises, and attempted ALL of the practice tests, then made the lowest grade ever on the nine MCSE+Internet tests. I passed--but barely. This book spends entire chapters on the basics of IE 5, Windows Media Player, Netmeeting, and it seemed like half of the book was on Outlook Express. None of these items were covered on the exam.The book did not explain any of the Profile Manager options--it only listed them--which is the whole reason for the low score I give the book. BUT, the author did an exceptional job delivering the content on the IEAK itself.Last note--the IEAK is now in version 5.5, and is a good bit different than the 5.1 version covered in the book. Also, IE 5.5, Windows Media Player 7.0, and Netmeeting are also ENTIRELY different than the versions taught in the book. Especially netmeeting."
4,"Good book! for 70-080, but not really great","This book contains pretty a lot of details and organized pretty well. BUT not ALL you would see in Exam are in this book. You might need to check an additional resouce for passing the exam.For me, the weakest point of this book is ""Exam questions"". The real questions would be more intensive and most of them are from real world situations, not much you can see on this book.Its CD-ROM is pretty useful, if you understand how to use it. I am pretty OK with this book. I'm rating it for 4. actually, it would be about 3.5.Anyway, I would recommend, if you want to pass 70-080 exam, the buttom line is to use this book as a fundamental one, and find another book for practicing exams. (I used Exam Cram)"
4,Good Preparation for the exam,"I bought the Exam Cram and this book. I thought this book was more thorough and covered more of the detail. The book was good, I recommend the Transcender instead of the Beach Front Quizzer thats included with this book, it needs some work. Overall, the book is good."
2,Poor book for certification exam,"The Solaris part 1 exam covered topics not included in this book.Positive reviews of this book are misleading and outdated.I saw many questions in the exam concerning dual boot, fssnap, ufsrestore, etc. that were not even covered in the book. I was not happy with this book after taking the test.Too many typos in the book and practice exam to consider this a reliable source. Look elsewere for help with certification. Decent general Solaris info, but there are better books to assist admins on install, disk setup, backup and restore strategies."
2,Not as good as most people think.,"I just took the part 1 exam (CX-310-200) today - 4/28/08 - and passed. So why only two stars? The book covered about 40% of the questions / materials on the actual test. The practice questions at the end of each chapter did not come close to representing the actual test. The practice exam on the CD did not come close either.It was my years of experience working with Solaris that helped me pass the test.If you are new to Solaris, do not depend on this book as the only study guide. If you do, even if you can memorize the book word for word, you WILL NOT PASS.I bought this book with high expectations, but I am disappointed.I am going to be looking for additional study materials to help me prepare for the part 2 exam."
1,Worst Solaris Book,"The book has very little coverage of the Solaris Material, doesn't cover all the exam topics, the questions after the chapeters and the sample test has nothing to do with the actual Solaris 10 Test."
1,Not a good reference manual,I purchased this book to be both a desktop reference and a study guide for certification. I have not taken the certification tests yet because I have serious doubts on the amount and quality of material covered in this text. The book is not indexed very well at all. Still looking for a good Solaris 10 reference guide for Unix Admins with experience in other flavors.
5,Very good book,"This is a rock solid book. Everything to the point, and all concepts put in context. When I read something, I want everyhting defined and explained right there, so I don't have to consult other books. This is a very much self contained book:all the concepts defined and explained clearly.Of course, like any other book, this book has errors too. But I don't understand why some people still keep advertizing the errros on this page while the author has already made the Errata available: I clicked on the link on Author's Amazon Connect page and downlaoded it, you can do it too!I've already passed exam one just by preparing from this book and trying the practice exams that come with the book, and now I'm preparing for the second exam. I find it very interesting read."
2,Worked for test1 barely,"This book barely covered the topics in either part of the test. I was able to pass test 1 barely after using this as my main study guide. Just took Test 2 two days ago, failed bad. Most of the questions were not covered in this book, some subjects not at all, others just an overview. Not enough depth to cover the test by far. This book is written in a way you can understand, as long as you can forgive some editting concerns, i.e. incomplete answers in the practice questions, directory names mispelled. Not a lot of them, but enough to annoy you when studying. All in all, its an acceptable study aid, as long as you use other methods as well, this book is no where near enough to get you past the test alone."
3,Fails to cover ZFS,Questions on ZFS are a major component of the part 1 examination. This book does not cover ZFS at all. This book also fails to cover WANboot which is a part 2 examination topic.
2,Don't buy this book,"It seemed to me that this book was written by and edited by persons whose first language is NOT English. I can stand a typo or two, but this book got on my nerves - and the typos were in critical exam related verbiage - ie: the nits that the exam picks!Also when I did the exam, and looked up the references, some were not on the page/in the section specified, or were not there at all. The quiz and the exam were the same questions - exactly. The same goes for the ""bonus"" downloadable quiz and exam. And the cd version of the exam only covers part one of the test, so you never get what you expected when you bought the book.Had I known what I was getting, I'd have just bought the two Caulkin books and not wasted my time."
3,Careful..,"I wasn't solaris certified before reading this book. Luckily I had ~10 years of experience with linux administration before taking this test. The book had a bunch of answers incorrect in the back of some sections. It's good for an overview, and it has some good examples, but I wouldn't recommend it for strict study. You need to do make sure you have access to Solaris machines for practice implementing the highlights."
4,This is the book,"Yes, there are typos in this book. If you are one of those people who throws a book out for that reason, then this is not the book for you. However, this is a very good book for both exam-prepping and for general reference. I used this book almost exclusively, and I managed to pass both exams. I expect my decoder ring in the mail within a few weeks. If you want a Solaris 10 book now, get this one. It is the best available. Maybe in a year or so, there will be another book that is the definitive on this subject, but for now, this is the one!"
5,Passed the Exam!,"Thanks to this boook, I've passed the first exam of this certification. I find this book very much to-the-point. I'm new to Soalris; actually new to UNIX altogether. So chapter 1 was very helpful for me. Being a beginner, I appreciate the fact that the book explains every concept. Even the entries in some important files are explained with diagrams. And everything is connected togehter like a story. Some Tips: Go through the practice exams on the CD, and memorize the file names and command options given in the book.Well, everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion (reading the criticism on this page) but I have all the Solaris 10 documentation on my laptop and I can tell you that this book is 100% compatible with Solaris 10. I'm sure it may have some errors, but then which book does not? I'm sure the publisher will make the Errata available.On to preparing for the second exam!"
3,Needs Additional book,This book is enough for certificate but you will need additional complete refrence to be good admin
1,This is a horrible study guide !!!!!!!,This is a horrible study guide. The errors are everywhere(not just one section through out the book). It's really lacking in the detail needed to pass the certifications. Don't buy this instead download the REAL SUN DOCS if you want to know Solaris 10.
4,Works with Xfinity,"Cable outlet was on the ""wrong"" wall in our bedroom and needed to go around the room. Worked great with our Xfinity HD cable box. Knocked it one star for only coming in navy blue. Why is there no white offering?"
4,Nice and flexible.,Works great to bring in HD signals from my attenea without the stiffness of reqular coax. I suppose I am missing something in the way of bandwidth but works well for me.
2,buy a snark instead,"while the chord library is really nice, that is the only thing i like about this. the tuner is a joke. if i would have paid more i would have returned it, so ill just keep it for the chord library."
5,Guitar Professor Guitar Tuner,"This Guitar Tuner is such a great and useful tool. It teaches chords and got me to play my guitar better in less than one day.Thanks, Austin Garcia"
5,Very nice tuner,For the money this product was very nice it looks cheap but works like it is supposed to and the cord finder helps alot with learning new songs. I really have no Gripe what so ever about it.
5,Does what it say it does..,I have a guitar tuner which is prob faster to work with but this unit does 3 things and is very handy. I like the chord finder. All 3 features work well. The tuner takes a few minutes to get used to but it works.The Pitchpipe works fine.It is small and very portable. Good deal for $10.
2,iPhone app will do better job for free,"It works fine, but feels very cheap, if you have a smartphone/iPhone you should download free app for tuning your guitar & learning chords. Have fun playing!"
3,qwik tune guitar tuner and chord finder,"Well... the tuner is nice, and the chord finder is pretty neat but the guys who I ordered from did not include this tuner and had me wait a very long time. I tried to call the store but nobody answered, and when they did they said they would call me back and didn't. Then I had to prove that I bought it and I had to prove that they didn't send it to me. I waited weeks for this. Austin Bazzar is ok. Good prices, crappy customer service and hopefully I won't need to shop with them any more."
1,Not a very accurate tuner,I was not happy with this device as I was not able to accurately tune my electric guitar.
4,a basic tuner,this is barely useful as a tuner. It does have a function to downtune. It can teaches you so many chords but I rarely learn the chords from a device because I've some good books to learn from.
5,really good for new people,"Well I just started playing about 2 weeks ago and I needed a tuner. This helps me tune my acoustic guitar and what i really like is that it tells me what chords to strum. Now if I need to do a C or D, I just search it and its all there. This is a steal for the price!!!"
2,Not Impressed by this product,"this product is okay if you are using an electric guitar and running it through the input. the sad part is it only picks up notes AB-DE-GABSOLUTELY NO C, F, OR FLAT/SHARP NOTES, so this makes it near impossible to do any dropped tunings other then dropped-D"
2,Not exactly what I expected,"Product is good for finding chords without having to look a chord chart, but I did not have good luck with the tuner. Tried many times to tune, but had no luck. Not sure if the tuner does not work properly or it's just sensitive. Anyhow, I re-purchased a Korg tuner,gave away first one, which works great and is easy to use."
4,Can be better,"It's not a bad product, but it looks cheap, well it is cheap, but well i tought it was bigger, you have to be really close to it to see if you are in the right cord, but the lights are really really helpfull, i bought it because of the chord finder, and its ok, a little hard to navigate but well, the mic for the acoustic guitar its not very sensitive and i get mad because i have to play the guitar really hard to tune it, but overall its a good tuner for electric guitar but not very good for acoustic, get it if you want a cheap all in one tuner."
3,it's ok,"Now that I know more about tuners this one is ok, but the kind that has a gage that lines up on the correct note is so much better. Spend a little more money and get the other kind.Nancy"
4,a nice product,You keep a certain distance between the tuner and the guitar. Please follow the instruction and will feel this tuner really a good product!
5,good item,"This item took a little while to get to me,however it works very well and was worth the money."
4,Guitar Tuner,this product is excellent! and very easy to use. my son is very happy to tune your guitar without problems
4,Very Content,"As a beginning guitar student, I found the chord finder and tuner both easy to use. The tuner can even ""hear"" the note from a few feet away."
3,Not a metronome,"Really cool product-- chords at your fingertips! However, with the word ""metronome"" in the product description, I feel misled. It does NOT have a metronome. Which, was what I was buying it for... since I don't really need the tuner. So, if you're looking for having chords available, and if you need a tuner, it's fantastic."
3,Alright,It was not what I expected. I thought it was going to be more computerized but it seemed more archaic.
2,Does the trick- just barely...,"I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store. Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right? The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well. The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate. It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely. Strike a note once, and it's sharp. Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune. I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better."
4,good low tech tuner,"I purchased this tuner a few weeks ago. While I didn't ever feel that tuning a guitar in the old fashioned way was all that difficult, this tuner makes it a bit quicker and is easier than using a tuning fork. One important thing to help tuning is to eliminate other noise sources while using it. I also like the chord feature. It is also easy to use and easy to read. The unit is small and fits inside the gear box in my guitar case. While I'm sure that there are more expensive units that are better, this is a very good value. I am happy that I got mine."
5,Proof that music speaks louder than words...,"Have you ever lost someone you really love and somehow got him/her back? And its better the second time around and you just can't believe its real? Well, if you have, then this is your song. I know it's mine. Brian's smooth, rich, and ""velvet-like"" voice soars and takes your soul and spirit into the clouds and keeps you wanting to hear it over and over... (And this is a heterosexual male speaking...) It's definitely worth a listen if you haven't heard it, and if you have, you know what I'm talking about. Brian's the man. Peace."
3,It's only OK,"I bought this CD mainly because I love Andrew Lloyd Webber but don't want to spend a lot of money. However, the quality of the songs aren't that great and several are instrumental even though in more expensive versions, there are actually lyrics. This is a good CD to buy if you're just becoming interested in Andrew Lloyd Webber's works, but if you have been a fan for a long time like me, you might be disappointed."
3,I'd rather listen to Jeb play the spoons!,"This is one of the worst renditions of Webbers' music that I have ever opened my ears to. While no music deserves one star, this collection nears that mark at a lowly three, narrowly missing two, only because the melodies are still in tact. However the resemblance to a Casio's song bank is uncanny, thus making these works hardly worth listening to mush less purchasable."
2,Absolutely Terrible!,"This collection of Webber numbers is an absolute disgrace to each and every song presented here. All of the songs sound like they were recorded using an electric keyboard, and most singing numbers have been reduced to purely 'orchestral' affairs. The song that sealed my hatred of this product was their rendition of ""Music of the Night"" from Phantom of the Opera. This was one of the few numbers that retained the choral parts, but the man they chose for it made my ears bleed, and the song- the formerly lovely duet between the phantom and a soft piano- has been changed into a synthesized, pop-like monstrosity. Skip this collection and buy the original recordings of your favorite Webber musicals; it's well worth the extra money, especially the original cast recording of Phantom of the Opera."
5,"Squire, Courtiers, Schleich","My used first name is SQUIRE....and use SQUIRE in all my many published writings. People like it 'cause it's unique as a name!!! This little ""squire"" sits above me at the computer for...inspiration!"
1,The worst game.,The worse game with the most problems. You can grind forever. The graphics aren't good compared to an N64 game made in 96. Once I fell and got like stuck and the screen jittered. When they fall they make the stupidest pain sound like they had the producer do it. THE WORST LEVEL DESIGN FOR ANY EXTREME SPORTS GAME and we play games for the level design.
1,Terrible,"This game just plain sucks. Midway tried to rush it out, and they just destroyed it. The glitches are just endless. You can go right through walls. You can grind until time runs out. Gravity games are an odd name for this title because that's one of the forces of nature that isn't in great supply here. Save your money, and get matt Hoffman pro BMX."
1,Worst BMX game ever made.,"This has been declared worst game of the year by many web sites and game reviewers. Avoid this one, and get Dave Mirra 2 instead."
2,"nice idea, poor quality","loved the idea of using this for my youngest daughter who is still a bit afraid to free swim/snorkel. It looked as if it would allow me to pull her along for a ride while all the time seeing a great view below. well right out of the box the window section leaked not allowing for extended usage (air bubbles collected in the window section) eventually the window that was leaking mostly popped out. this was all with kid-gloves light usage trying to protect the leaking window. I suppose that I could have glued the window at some point but...never mind. the good news is my daughter learned to snorkle on her own! I can thank the defect in this item for that! Mine may have been a QC problem and the rest are fine but be forewarned, test yours immediately upon reciept for leaks/defects. Great idea spoiled by poor quality."
5,"Brought to Cayman Islands for 1-5 year olds, worked perfectly","So so glad we brought this. It was wonderful! The only problem we had with it was out kids fighting over it. Brought it to Grand Cayman, and hoped it would help, and we saw fish, turtles, eagle rays, and my kids thought it was heavenly. Even our 16 month old got on and glued his face to the glass to watch the scene under water. He threw a fit when he had to share with his brothers and sister. Perfect for kids up to age 8, I think. Bigger kids their body would be hanging off but it would work fine too, probably.I hope we use it again someday..."
3,Good,"Got the injection cleaner really fast shipping, good price, good quality to expect from OTC Tool. Doesn't come with a case, but there is a part number to get one. Instruction indicate a case comes with the 7649. Would have rated it higher with the case."
5,Missing Information,"And ...... the TOTAL NUMBER of Tena Ultimates in a ""case"" is .......?????This is a ridiculous oversight."
1,Hid amount per case,The price per case which ends up to be 40 pads per case was ridiculously high. A 36 count bag sells for 16.99 your 40 ct. case for 41.53 cents is highway robery...never again
1,My Favorite B-S book of all time,"Aahhhhh finally my favorite!A wonderful personal daily diary on Elvis!I have just a few questions:Just how would these two ""Elvis wonders"" know what went on EVERYDAY of Elvis life?Were they there with Elvis every moment?Were they a fly on the wall in a past life?Did a psychic tell them EXACTLY what happened to Elvis and when?Maybe they were Elvis reincarnated?If these men knew Elvis' daily happenings, they would have to be at least 10 years old in 1935, to remember anything ... and that would make both men around 76 in age, right?ONLY ELVIS CAN WRITE HIS DIARY --- NOT THE MASTERS OF THE ELVIS UNIVERSE!"
5,A great maxi-single,"This is a really good cd single from the Cranberries. To me, the highlight of the disc is the b-side song ""Cordell"" found on the Japanese version of ""To the faithful departed"". It also has an acoustic version of Zombie from MTV Unplugged, as well as a live version of Free to Decide. This is a good cd to have if you conside yourself a cranfan."
1,Disappointed,"This movie didn't come anywhere near the quality of Zane Grey's book, so I was very disappointed. I hope that the other movies made from his books are better than this one."
2,Disappointed,"This VCR movie was a disappointment to me. I have the Zane Grey book this movie was made from, and Clint is entirely different from the way he was represented. The storyline followed the book very loosely, and what was left out was important. I feel sad if this is the only movie of that great book."
2,Basic Meter.,"Not a very useful meter. It is very limited when it comes to reading resistance. There is only one scale for Ohms. So, from 500 to 2000 Ohms is about you can read accurately. Also, there is no audible tone for testing continuity. Check Sperry meters before buying one of these. They cost about the same, and have far better features."
2,Way to Long,"My husband is tall but these pants have and inseam of 35.5"" and being elastic cuffs would make them equivalent to pants with an inseam greater than 36"". This extra long inseam should have been noted in the description of the pant."
2,Giant,"Be warned that these crackers are giant. They don't look the the oyster crackers you're probably thinking of. That said, they taste fine and are a good value. Still, I wish I would have known in advance that they aren't traditional oyster crackers."
4,The BEST Oyster Crackers Made!,"The title says it all, but the down fall is the quantity you must order since no single family would use them up by their expiration date."
4,OTC Oyster Crackers,"OTC Oyster Crackers are another hard-to-locate product. Formerly widely available either loose or boxed, they are a hard sour-dough cracker which enhances the flavor of any soup but, particularly, that of Snow's New England Clam Chowder. Formerly from Trenton, NJ. Taste just great"
2,"Glad to find OTC's, but...","Like others, I grew up with OTC's. Received the shipment and it was full of stale crackers. Contacted Amazon and they shipped another order. They were stale also. Would not order again. I'll wait until I go back to Jersey and visit Allen's Clam Bar (in Tuckerton/New Gretna area) to get the real deal."
2,A Chore to Read,"I've been reading a number of memoires of WWII German generals, so I picked up this book. I don't regret reading it as contains an account from an important player in that war. However, I found it very dry and without much soul, unlike the memoires of Guderian, Rommel, von Luck, or even the cerebral von Manstein. And unless you are really into the details of tank battles, it contains very little new if you've read Guderian and von Manstein because the author succeeds pretty well in hiding himself.If you like detailed accounts of battles, you may find this book to be interesting. If you tend to like war stories or some reflections on the war experience, this book will probably leave you cold. Worthwhile read I think, but definitely not a pleasure. If I were to assemble a reading list of German commanders, I'd probably put this book toward the end of the list."
3,Panzer Battles: A study of the Employment of Armor in WWII,This book is a hard read. It is very informative almost to the point of redundency but its purpose is well served. I enjoyed the information presented but found it harder to get through than most books on this subject.
4,read with military curiorsity but with political discretion,"Great military insights, a classic Prussian staff officer's work. A must read for understanding armour battles in WW2, especially those on the Eastern Front where the most intense armour battles took place. Tactics and commands were well-analyzed in most chapters.However, politically this book seems a defense for the German General Staff. As a general in the Wehrmacht, Mellenthin disappointed me for not expressing opinion towards the Holocaust, and in general his opinions towards the Red Army and the Russian people seemed too strong."
5,Great read for people interested in history and soldiers,"A very good book covering World War 2 from the perspective of a German General Staff Officer. Especially interesting is Part 2 about the war in the Western Desert. Von Mellenthin describes Rommel's leadership methods, the reasons for victories and defeats. In Part 3 he writes about the Russian theatre, the skills of Generals like Manstein or Balck, who takes the author with him as his Chief of Staff from Corps to Army level in Russia and to Army Group G in the Western Front. I can highly recommend Panzerbattles not only for readers of military history but also for soldiers who want to know more about lessons learned in World War 2."
3,VIEW FROM A PRUSSIAN,"I've had this book for almost 25 years, and it's physically pretty well beat up. Its best topics are in the breadth he encompasses. Writing as basically an operations officer, there's little of the tactical aspects from his writing to excite , unless you happen to be a hard-core WWII afficienado. His history is somewhat stale, and there is also a certain element of personal self-defense in his portrayal (remember: the winners always determine the war criminals); it still remains an excellent read. My 3-star rating is not meant to denigrate the piece. It will remain a valuable insight into WWII German staff work, actions, and reactions, and when my copy finally falls to pieces, it will indeed be replaced."
4,"Good book, but not an easy read","This book is another of the classic written by German Generals after the war. If you are looking for a good accont of tactics, and how the German army fought, this is another great book.There are a few small errors in the authors memory, but that can be excused, as there are mistakes in all after the fact accounts of the war. They do not take away from the book.The only thing I did not like about the book was that it was not easy to read. It took me over a month to read the first half of the book covering the war up through North Africa. Once I got to the second half of the book dealing with Russia I finnished the book in three days. I admit a bias to an interest in the eastern front, but for some reason the first half of the book was painfully dull even if it was informative.Ad this book to your list with Von Luck, Guderian, and Manstein."
5,Egyptian Phrasebook a Lifesaver!,"I ordered this book 2 years ago just before going to visit my in-laws. My Arabic is still not to the point where I can hold a decent conversation, but thankfully some of the family spoke English. This book definitely helped when we were all at a loss for words because it contains both the transliteration and the Arabic script. Even if you're not familiar with the sounds of the Arabic letters, you can always just show someone the book and they can read it and perfectly understand what you're trying to say.I really love this book and recommend it to all my friends who are traveling to Egypt."
4,Helpful not intimedating,"Having traveled to Egypt 3 years ago, I tried to learn some Arabic......... with little success. This phrase book is very easy to use. I know that I won't be speaking fluently so it is great to have a handy ""guide"" when I return to Egypt later this year!!"
3,Make sure to get the right Arabic book,"I recently bought this book because I was headed to Syria and wanted a phrase book that was helpful and compact. Although the book meets all the requirements, I picked the wrong type of Arabic for Syria (Levantine Arabic). Make sure that if you are headed to the Middle East, you research what type of Arabic they speak, i.e. Egyptian vs. Eastern Arabic!!!"
1,didn't really need it,got the regular lonely planet egypt book - that was good enough. i didn't really use this book during the trip. flipped through it once while on the plane there but that was about it.
2,not so helpful,"Just got back from Egypt found that this phrasebook wasn't very helpful as the the phrases in the book often didn't match what people were actually saying.Although the phrases weren't so useful, the dictionary was ok for basic words."
1,Bottle arrived broken and was unreturnanble,The bottle was half empty and broken.It should be replaced or I should get my money back.H. Gutierrez
2,its ok,"Worked ok for a while, although it seemed the steel body got way too hot for grabbing with your bare hands. The biggest problem though arose while trying to clean it - the plastic insert separated from the metal outer shell and you could see where the wires had almost burnt some of the attachement tape. Never worked again after it separated. My view - worked great, but poor quality construction."
5,Heated Car mug EXCELLENT!,Excellent product. Great price!!! very well packaged and shipped quickly. I would use this vender again for sure.
4,Keeps Coffee Hot in Car,"Tip: Before using, rinse interior in baking soda to remove the metal taste.Stainless steel mug fits in cup holder while plugged into car lighter. Heating element works fast. Once you unplug, coffee stays hot for about an hour. Good quality product.UPDATE: I've been using this product for awhile now. One problem is that the cup needs to be full for the heating element to work."
5,A Different Perspective in Econometrics,Spanos describes a different way of doing econometrics refocusing on the statistical properties of the data we are trying to investigate. Clearly stating and testing the statistical assumptions of any econometric model is central in his approach. A really good book.
3,"very thorough, but at times sloppy with notation","Spanos does a good job integrating mathematical theory with the nuts-and-bolts stuff you'd expect from a standard econometrics text. Some have said that Spanos uses too much mathematical notation, but I found just the opposite: many of the passages suffer from ambiguities and outright errors; a more formal treatment would have improved the text considerably."
1,Red Rooster dust mask,"I was hoping that the Red Rooster mask would be comparable to the 3M 8500 model. As it turns out, I purchased 124.00 worth of useless mask. They are too flimsy, disfigured in the box, and approximately one half of the elastic head bands break upon application. These are not exagerated findings."
2,Does not work on small pills,"I bought this to help my daughter swallow her daily medication: a small pill and a capsule. I put the pill on the shelf and as she lifted the cup to her lips the pill shifted and slipped through the slats and into the water. It started to dissolve immediately.She did not get the capsule down, either. Perhaps with more practice it will work but it's already been a frustrating journey."
1,Did not work for my kid.,"Did not work for my kid. Even tried it a few times myself, thinking it was just my kid, but couldn't even swallow a small pill with the cup and I can do it without a cup. Not recommended."
4,Suits the needs of the do-it-yourselfer,"I have had this tool for about 5 years now and have used it to re-wire my house and garage. The strippers still work flawlessly even after years of use. The wire cutter, on the other hand, has got rather chewed up and does not cut wire cleanly and I usually have to use the cutter on my pliers to handle this task. Still, this tool represents a good value for the buck, and I have not yet felt the need to shop for a replacement."
4,as advertised,this product was in prime condition and has worked well for me. the cutting and stripping blades are sharp and have had noticeable dulling to them. good strong fabrication but is pretty light for it's size.
4,Electrical Buddy,This item is a must have for the electrician and the do it yourselfer handy mans tool.Many uses for a tool like this on your side!
2,Terrible controls,"I think this game would be a lot of fun if the controls didn't lag so much. Like a few of the other reviewers, I have a brand new computer that far surpasses the requirements for this game, and still it runs slow. I have even turned the graphic settings all the way down, and that didn't help either. For now I have given up on the game, beause it is too hard to play, but hopefully the company will release a patch one day. I was really looking forward to playing this game, as I have enjoyed the other Broken Sword games, but I am sorely disappointed. As I said before, it would probably be a lot of fun, if it wasn't so hard to control."
3,Broken Sword IV,"When I had finished this game, I was not very happy, I found the game a bit empty, compeared to the other three games. I am a big fan of the BrokenSword serie, and have had alot of fun playing them.This game is fun, George still got his funny coments. It could have been a super game if the creators of it had put in more work, there are places where you feel you you don't know whats going on and the whole situation feels stupid.But it is fun, you will enjoy, but it is not as good as the three before it."
3,"Good to view, bad to control","Although the story and graphics are good enough (not astonishing), the control of characters and interactive object is not something you can enjoy."
2,killed a franchise,"Unfortunately this substandard game will go down in history as the piece of software that killed the brokensword franchise. Listing its defects is describing most adventure games these days: badly thought-out puzzles, sleepy progression in the game (zzzz), a hard to follow story, dubious character motivation etc. Nothing wrong with the graphics, game run fine, no bugs that I noticed. Just a massively boring game where you have to force yourself to go ahead. I tried to keep up for a few sessions and eventually capitulated and moved on to a better game (culpa innata)"
4,Great concept - story ok,My kids love a book that can read to them! The book directs questions to the reader which really encourages interaction. It's a bit annoying that the puppet has to hiccup through the story. But we liked it enough to order the bear book too.
3,Fair,"I was so glad to see another Maggody book! And, I liked it - but...think it dragged in parts - I almost felt as if this was the ""wrap it all up"" book - because it seemed every single citizen of Maggody had to be mentioned - no matter how obsurely. I liked the book - just not as much as I've liked the others. The humor was not as sharp."
3,Evolving?,"This read like a transition to a more serious Arly, which I very much hope doesn't actually happen. I found it disappointing that, like every other fictional female sleuth, she suddenly needs a man to solve her problems; the strong and caustic loner is going all domestic. If it's true to the trite formula that applies to Hess's other series, Jack will start complaining about Arly sticking her pretty inept nose where it doesn't belong in the next installment, especially given the ending (which just make me groan -- and why the heck do Ruby and Estelle KNOW this in the first place? That's just gross). And all the discussion about her New York Socialite past was scary -- does the character really need to go there? I could see this going in an interesting direction if Jack is suddenly out of the picture and Arly is allowed to return to character, given the not-too-surprising ending, but otherwise this might be the death of the series."
4,Surprising,"I have found the Maggody series to be boring and irritating for the last several novels. This new one actually surprised me with several departures from the formulaic. There were actually a few likeable/sympathetic characters for a change. And a little witty dialogue!Maybe if we continue to see a few more of these positive changes, there is hope for this series."
2,clear coat went to crap soon after.,"i loved this watch, it just looks like crap now. the clear coat like melted and i have never exposed it to high heat or left in the sun. i took very good care of it and it looks like junk. i would just buy a used one next time because it will show every ding and scratch you could possibly get. it is near impossible to take a link out and adjust the size. i emailed nixon about it and they never returned my email. this thing weighs a ton and i had to take it off after awhile to give my wrist a rest. it still is a unique watch and cool doesnt really mean comfortable. i had to take it off so often that i left it somewhere and somebody stole it. i may get another some day just to wear occasionally. the dark wood almost is black, id rather have gotten teak."
3,Naughty Democrat stories,"Donkey Cons: Sex, Crime, and Corruption in the Democratic Party by Lynn Vincent and Robert Stacy McCain was a bit of a disappointment. The cover and introduction promise stories of crime and misdoings throughout the entire history of the Democrat Party, but much of the book focuses on the last 25 years or so. Scandals involving Roosevelt and other older Dems are glossed over without detail. The writers seem to assume that the reader is already familiar with those events. Much focus is placed on the shenanigans of the Clinton White House, which almost seems to be an issue done to death. Vincent and McCain do bring up several Republican wrong-doers to be fair. I think the writers' strongest point is that while Republicans seem to face up to their crimes or at least have to pay the penalty, Democrats very often do not and are occasionally rewarded for them. This point alone is worth reading the book for."
3,"Yes, the author has a point of view.","Some of the reviewers below criticize this book, essentially, for having a point of view. Unlike the `news', I don't expect all books to be balanced and objective; an author writing a book from a particular point of view is OK with me as long as it's clear the author is stating a point of view.Other reviewers label the author as a "".. ranting ... lunatic..."". It seems that these reviewers are calling the author a lunatic because of his accusations of outrageous behavior - which cannot possibly be true - so he must be a lunatic. I believe this is called ""begging the question"".Finally one reviewer asserts that the authors footnotes don't check out. Sadly this reviewer gives no examples.As for me, I suggest you read the book yourself and form your own opinions. It just may have something worthwhile to say!"
1,Wow!,"What a load of BS! This guy is a GOP wingnut with a history or racist ranting. This book is nothing more than lies and more lies. If he wants to document corruption, he should look at the Reagan administration which had the highest number of felons of any administration in history. (Bush seems to be catching up, however.) Sad to see such deluded folks trying to sell the GOP party line. Of course what can you expect from a Rush Limbaugh dittohead?"
1,Conned by Self-Delusion,"This book is pure demagoguery. If I could I would rate it negative 5 stars for mendacity. No one could be that disingenuous unless they were short a few screws, which I am inclined to agree with after watching this character on book TV. After reading the reviews of the book's supporters, one person said, ""After all, it is difficult to read if you are blinded by hatred or prejudice."" The authors of this book are blinded by hatred and prejudice. Much of it is true and they try to appear balanced by including some watered down Rebublican faux pas'. People who really know history and possess any wisdom know that both sides have much to atone for, but these authors have an agenda which is to make the Republicans appear more moral than the Democrats, which is patent nonsense. Anyone who believes this is truly prejudiced, blind, illogical and grotesquely unwise. This book is simply ""my team is better than your team"" because I said so and belongs to junior high mentality."
5,A really good guide to the Kama Sutra.,"I've been looking for ways to make sex more fulfilling in my marriage of 23 years. My husband thought that a workshop or classroom situation would be uncomfortable and after looking at several books on the Kama Sutra bought two - Anne Hooper's and this. Both are great. What I like about this book is that it is more than the Kama Sutra - it has practical information and great insights into relationship issues like communication, psychological issues, and other factors that get in the way of sex being good."
5,Wowie!Loved it!,"Wow! What a wonderful treat.This docu showed the good, bad, and the reality of falling and staying in love. From the harshness of young love, to the tenderness of a caring spouse taking care of his ailing wife,this docu kept me riveted from start to finish. It left me wanting more, like a great book, you did not want it to end......"
3,Nicely done...,"Very well done. Just felt like the selected stories could've been slightly more compelling. My favorite was the single dad awaiting his twins, and the elderly couple. Very moving."
1,Time of Delivery,I ordered a book Aug 20. Money was taken from my credit card and delivery is estimated at September 20 2010. I do not understand that. That is a little crazy!!!!!! Please tell me that a mistake was made in the email sent to me.!!
4,A Great Adaptation of Le Morte d'Arthur,"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is an adaptation of Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Though this adaptation is written for children, adults will find this book to be a great introduction to the characters and stories of Arthurian legends. Merlin, Arthur, Lancelot, Galahad, Guinevere, and others are featured in this abridgement which is divided into three parts: The Making of a King, Brave Knights and Strange Adventures, and The Holy Grail. The book concludes with a brief biographical profile of Sir Thomas Malory who died in 1471. Despite its brevity, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table captures the spirit and themes of Arthurian literature."
2,seems to be cheaply made,I was looking for a halogen picture light (as halogen seems to be the best light for displaying artwork) and ordered this one thinking it'd be good. The plastic piece that you mount on the wall was badly cracked when it arrived and I had to send it back. It didn't seem very sturdy at all and also hung out from the wall more than I thought it would (when I just hand held it in place to see what it would look like). It would seem to attract attention to itself- rather than subtly lighting the picture. I would not order this type again but would go for a more low profile model that is less obtrusive.
1,Dsappointed,"I purchased 2 of these lights for my artwork thinking I would receive a quality product based on price.One of the transformers did not work but was quickly replaced.Herein lies the rub....After several months, one of the fixtures began emitting a faintly noticeable bit of smoke. A couple days later the bulb did not light. I went to replace that bulb & I found the fixture was brittle & crumbling. The other is still working fine but I now am concerned about the safety of the product."
1,Why its not good,"I have been playing the piano for a total of fifty two years and eight months now, and i can't say i've ever seen a piece of music with a greater lack of flow."
5,Way cool photos!,"Using the Lensbaby is an EASY way to make artistic photographs out of the most banal scenes. I enjoy using it, although it definitely takes some playing around. The lighting has been my only issue, and if I knew more about how to set up the manual settings on my Nikon D90 I'm sure that would be alleviated. I'm no photography pro; I just know how to set up a good shot and take an enjoyable photo. The Lensbaby lets me have fun with with the picture. I can't wait to take it to my family's annual Texas kids-in-the-bluebonnets photo shoot."
2,Lens Baby Review ---no recommended,"Bought it and thought that I'd be able to put it to use. Cheap in price and the quality is just the same. Kinda tricky to use, but you can get used to it. Had to return it because it's not a practical lens, even just for [...] bucks."
2,its what youd expect for the price,"i bought this because i am a huge fan of tilt shift photos and wanted to shoot some of my own. i got the canon version at what i considered a very good price and when i received it i was not impressed at all. usually id keep something if it was this cheap because it would still have a use, but this lens tends to give a motion blur look in the blurred out areas instead of a depth of field blur look, which is what i really wanted. i guess i will have to save up and get a better version of this lens, or even the actual canon one."
4,lensbaby camera lens,The lens baby is a quality product. It does take sometime to learn how to best use it. the results are quite acceptable for such a simple tool. Amazon is convenient to use to acquire wanted/needed products.
5,Sleepy time,I bought this cd for my grandchildren. I wanted something soothing to play for them as they fell asleep. This cd is just that. Thank you.
3,"nice melody, not what I hoped for","while the story behind the disk is loveable , the product is not what I hoped for. This is mostly INSTRUMENTAL music, with a minimum of actual singing. I was misguided about what I will receive. It is still an Ok disk for the nursery."
2,Dissappointed,"This album is falsly advertised. For Dads??? Why??? This album is gender free because it is 95% orchastraded! Only two songs have vocals! Just because the two songs have a man singing, it would hardly make you feel that this album is specially made for Dad!Besides my gripes, the music is mellow, pretty, and soothing. But shucks, I already have CDs that have these qualities!"
2,Kind of a let down,"Based on the other reviews of this album I expected it to be quite good. However, it is actually kind of sappy, and I can't really spend much time listening to it without feeling a bit unhip. My husband complains that it sounds like musak, the stuff you hear in elevators. I think that the original versions of these songs were better. However if you like 'easy listening' music you might like this CD. Also, it does act as a sleep aid, simply due to the fact that the music isn't that exciting. We haven't used this to soothe our baby to sleep much simply because we aren't too fond of the album. I also bought ""Celtic Twilight Vol 3: Lullabies"" and I like that a lot more."
5,This is a wonderful CD,I give this as a gift to eveyone that has a new baby. I played this for my son when he was a baby and now he is 9 and still likes to listen to it when he falls asleep.
5,Awesome!,"I have been a fan of Dave Koz for quite some time. I heard about this new cd and had to have it - there are great artists performing on this cd. Every song is absolutely soothing, heartwarming, comfy and cozy. This cd is not just great for naptime or bedtime but for ANYTIME! Fantastic addition to your collection!"
2,"One good song, otherwise disappointing","I bought this CD because I read so many great reviews and lets face it, the cover picture is absolutely adorable. However, I found only one great song ""Isn't she beautiful"" otherwise, the sound quality was terrible and I expected more vocals. In addition, the website on the cover advertising baby e-announcement does not work."
2,Compilation,"Maybe I didn't read the description close enough, but I got the impression this album was all Dave Koz, instead it seems like a compilation with Koz on maybe three tracks at most. There's some nice pieces on it (Isn't She Lovely stands out) but overall I really wanted more of a saxophone type album."
1,"Tolerable Mindless Instrumental Sold To The Masses, Avoid!","Once I checked into this cd and listened the entire available songs in there, I finally had to turn off my stereo and considering take it to near-by retailers so I can get few dollars back. The artist plays only something so-called ""gentle instrumental"" or ""smooth jazz"", and yet he has yet mastered the skill of intrepretating the music to the audiences, even though he plays the saxophone fluently. However, i just don't see Dave Koz got any talent in conveying and delivering musical messages at all. This is very commericalized released just like his previous releases. The only people would the buy this kind of materials are those mindless listener looking for pointless instrumental to play in the office or ""may be his baby boy's bedroom. The child may even cry when he gets to get to the middle of the song. The drum machine or synthesiser or whatever they used for the song caused me a headache. For serious music listener should avoid."
1,Ugh...boring and insipid,"I received this CD as a gift and have to say I found it completely irritating. I guess if you're a big ""smooth jazz"" or easy listening fan, this CD might appeal to you, but to me, it's essentially Muzak -- milquetoast pablum. The kind of stuff that I associate with the waiting room in the dentist's office."
1,Fewzak,"God what a snore!Belongs in with Montovani/Percy Faith elevator music,not jazz fusion.I wish I could give ZERO stars."
2,Not Exactly!,"I'm disappointed with the way Dave Koz's Golden Slumbers is marketed to the public. When I ordered this CD I thought it had something to do with children. When I received it and listened to it, however, I realized that the Golden Slumbers is in fact made for adults who are going on a date while thinking about making babies. I think the CD is potentially a more suitable background music for a romantic, candle-lights dinner at home."
1,PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM,"VERY NICE SONGS EXCEPT FOR THE LAST ONE ""GOLDEN SLUMBERS"" THE CHILD AT THE END SAYS AND I QUOTE ""DADDY AND MOMMY THE BABY'S DIED"" I HAD TO LISTEN TO IT MANY TIMES BEFORE I HEARD THIS DISTURBING LINE AT THE END OF A GREAT ALBUM"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz-literally a snore,"If you like smooth jazz, DON'T BUY this noodling boring sleeper of a dud. This would give my kid nightmares....what were these great artists thinking?"
4,wake up at 13th song,"It's a wonderful CD. But my baby is always woke up by 13th song when it sings ""you can close your eyes....."" :)"
5,Beautiful Bedtime music,"I searched hard to find a CD with beautiful, soft music to play at bedtime for my daughters that didn't sound like kids music. This CD is it! I love this CD. I once heard one of the tracks in a mall, and I instantly thought of my girls."
5,The perfect gift for new parents,"This CD is amazing. My husband is a fan of David Koz and he bought this for our now 16 month old son. When I first rocked and held him to the sounds of Isn't she Lovely...I just cried at this miracle I held. The songs are very soothing, even to me and as soon as I put this CD on, my son knows it's time for sleep. Of all the many lullaby CDs I have, this is my favorite! I highly recommend it."
5,Tenderness for baby; relaxation for yourself.,"Having taught Kindermusik, I've listened to countless children's CD's. This is by far my favorite lullaby CD! I include it in every baby gift I give. #9 Somewhere Over the Rainbow with Rick Braun on the flugelhorn is magical. Share it with those YOU love. Well done fathers!!!"
5,Beautiful Lullabies!,This is a beautiful CD! I love every single lullaby in this CD. This CD has put my baby (and I) to sleep many afternoons.
4,compilation of american lullabies,It's a good compilation of american lullabies - it definitely works!
5,Soothing Cd - Highly Recommend,This CD is great! I enjoy listening to it and my daughter quickly falls asleep:)
4,Thirteenth Floor Elevators - 'Reverberations' (Atom) 4 1/2 stars,"Specially,for the asking price,I'm giving this CD a 4 1/2 star rating.Total of 22 tracks.Most are taken from the band's three 'actual' albums.The last string of songs are cuts that I simply don't remember or I can assume they're maybe unreleased material.Tunes ""Street Song"",""Dr.Doom"" and ""With You"" are actually pretty good,I thought.Make sure you're in the right mood when you check this disc out.Just SO '60's-ish.Recommended."
3,I'VE HEARD BETTER,"I cannot say anything positive or negative about this compilation - only that this was my first introduction to this band.My comments will be directed toward this band in general. So far, I hold PLASTICLAND to be the paragon or pinnacle band of garage-psych rock music and unfortunately, the ELEVATORS do not even come close. This band is alright but nothing special.So far from what I've heard, they seem to employ this bubbling sound effect to enhance the listener's perception of psychedelia on every song which I have found rather very irritating and annoying.Do yourself a favor and purchase the 30 song compilation of PLASTICLAND and you will realize the true essence of garage-psych rock music."
4,Recommended,"Powlison gives a very strong argument for why modern ""demon-deliverance"" ministries miss the mark. If you are involved in such ministry, you need to read this book - it will at the very least challenge some of your beliefs and practices (it did for me)."
2,mediocre at best,"There are just so many great books on entertaining out there. This one is not worth the money, nor the time. The ""advice"" is truly simple common sense. Might be helpful if you were ""raised in a barn""."
5,A GREAT BRIDAL SHOWER GIFT!,"This is a great book to give to the about-to-be-married. Certainly will appeal to those who have not given many or any parties and are apprehensive about getting into the circuit. It will dispel any fears the new party-giver will experience and will reinforce good habits of experienced party-givers. A good starter book to get on the road to successful party giving. The recipes are easy to follow and don't take 4 days to prepare. The authors present their ideas with humor and in a manner consistent with those who entertain at home and enjoy it! Their enthusiasm is boundless. As an ""older"" buyer, I can confidently say that this is a worthwhile book to own and to give as gifts!"
1,Unsophisticated and annoying!,The authors mistakenly believe the reader would be interested in ad nauseum details of their personal partying! Nothing new or inspired in this tiny book.
2,Broken Drum,"This rhythm band set was touted as being for toddlers. When it came, the favorite instrument, of course, was the drum. Within 10 minutes of normal use by a 4 year old, the drum head was broken. When I examined it, I saw that it was made of paper. A toddler toy should be made of indestructable materials, not brown paper bag material. This was a birthday present for one of my twin grandsons. He was terribly disappointed, and so am I. I would never recommend this toy to anyone, even though the rest of the instruments were appropriately constructed."
2,drum broke,"Broke on Christmas morning, less than 15 minutes of use by a 3yo. Tambourine is built the same way; kids afraid to play it for fear of breaking it."
3,Just for Children,"While looking for instrument sets, I came across this one. I was a little skeptical of the quality, but decided to order anyways. I am just starting a music therapy business, so I'm limited on what I can afford. The instruments are packaged well, and come with a CD. This set would be great for non-musicians that just want to jam with their kids, but musicians might think the quality is not very good. Specifically, the rhythm sticks are very light, and do not carry sound well. The tambourine is ""ok,"" and the drum (it reminds me of a tom-tom) can sound very abrasive. Basically, the instruments do not resonate as well as I hoped, but...ya get what ya get. I will still be using these for little children, but I highly recommend no adult ever try to use this for themselves."
1,Will never exist...this must be a scam or something,"OK, they pushed this up another year...maybe so they can hold onto everyone's money...probably be 2001 next year!"
3,Rigid format,"I cannot see this DVD on my TV, it seems that the problem is about the format of the DVD. The DVD must have been formated for Region 1 instead of Region 2 which correspond to european countries such as Spain."
3,Get the subtitled Special Edition version,"First off, Lumumba is an exciting, dramatic film that I recommend very highly.However, this version of the DVD in addition to being dubbed into English, is censored in at least one place. Toward the end, at a moment crucial to a historical understanding of the role of other countries (including the U.S.) in sealing Lumumba's fate, the name of the United States official is actually beeped out on the soundtrack. Why? Did it have something to do with this being the version aired on HBO?Of course, it's possible that there are other instances of censorship on this DVD that I'm unaware of.I'd recommend getting the subtitled Special Edition. The price isn't THAT much more and it has some good special features that make the higher price worth it."
4,"Important subject matter, a bit hard to follow","I would recommend this film, but couched in the warning that I found it a bit hard to follow. There are a lot of characters - the various political figures - and sometimes it's hard to keep them all straight. It's definitely important subject matter though - an interesting glimpse into the colonial forces that shaped modern Africa and the struggles that continue today in many of its troubled nations."
5,"A Haunting Story, Excellent Film","This movie is an excellent in its depiction of Mr. Lumumba. Strong, sensitive and committed to his people this movie depicted a strong man senselessly murdered after betrayal by his own countrymen. Mr. Ebouaney's performance was Oscar worthy! This is a must see movie."
4,Solid,"We enjoyed the study in our small group. We had 5 couples, and did a weekly study during the summer, which was perfect. We thought it might be a bit much, but it ended up being great. Some folks came and went throughout the study and that worked too.It took a bit to get used to using the 'optional' questions, but once we figured out how to pick and choose to incorporate those, it went great."
1,These are crap,Bought them for much more at Lowes. After a year or so they stop sensing & stay on all nite. There is a reason they are on clearance. Junk!!!
2,2 out of 4 fixtures did not function and a replacement has been requested,"After installation two of the four fixtures did not come on after dark.After a long minute phone wait I finally spoke to a Helpline person at Heath Zenithand they assured me I would get two replacements mailed to me.I did get one replacement and have again sent a request for a second replacement.The two units that work are doing well and have no issues.I will buy a different unit next time as these obviously have a high failure rate, probablythat's why the price is so cheap."
1,Don't waste your time,I bought 2 and both stop working within 2 months. Moisture got into the cheap plastic sensor housing and shorted out. I should have spent the extra money and got a better built unit.
4,Works and inexpensive.,"I purchased this product based on other customer reviews and the price. Arrived on time, and it installed easily without any problem. I have had it for about 2 months now and it is still working great.Good product for the price!"
1,Major flaw,The mounting holes of this light are 45 degrees off the vertical or horizontal axis of the holes on the electrical box. It is impossible to mount correctly without some unsightly drilling.
5,work well,easy to install; sense motion in the night; large sense area; The unit works just the way it should be.
4,Universal wireless garage door opener,This product is the same as the one I saw at Home depot and it works great. Takes a few minutes to code it correctly but instructions were detailed.
4,a great book deserves a great production,"Hemingway's work here is very valuable but the book has a small typeface and it is printed in grey rather than black, so it is awkward to read unless your eyes are perfect. Also the book is heavier than I think it needs to be. Among Hemingway's best work his short stories stand out most, and these articles are worth having along with them. My favourites are about skiing in Switzerland and also Christmas in Europe. The writing should have five stars."
5,Writing by a true master of the craft,"This sample paragraph from the book demonstrates Hemingway's mastery of the craft of writing:Bull Fighting a TragedyFor the Toronto Star Weekly October 20, 1923It was spring in Paris and every thing looked just a little too beautiful. Mike and I decided to go to Spain. Strater drew us a fine map of Spain on the back of menu of the Strix restaurant. On the same menu he wrote the name of a restaurant in Madrid where the specialty is young suckling pig roasted, the name of a pension on theVia San Jeronimo where the bull fighters live, and sketched a plan showing where the Grecos are hung in the Prado."
1,This game is garbage,"I am a sucker for flashy boxes and screen shots. I bought this game last week and was pumped to spend a number of mindless hours blasting things away. I spent about 20 minutes on it and got so upset, it triggered a seizure. So not only did I not like the game, but I spent 20 more minutes flopping around on the floor and making a drool puddle on the carpet. Do not buy this game as it is terrible. SNooks to the makers!"
1,problee the 5th to last game I would every get!!!,if you don't want to get past the 3ed level buy fire blade it's to hard.
2,Boring,"I found this game to be incredibly boring. I did not like it. It gets 2 stars for effort, but that's it."
2,To Difficult,"Graphics are good, controls are good except the sniper needs to be redesinged.I too had the game freeze up on me after completing a difficult mission and had to rerun it.Swarmer missiles, great if you ever got to use 'em. This is a definate rental.Like 90% of games today they look good but the gameplay lacks heavily.This game is no different."
5,Excellent introduction,"I felt that this was an excellent intorduction to an area otherwise overcrowded with untested and semi validated ""methodologies"". I loved the fact that this title is not vendor specific (unlike some other titles trying to sell you tools or what!). Seeing the MKP name on it is reassuring. Would'nt hesitate to recommend this one!"
3,good overview of data mining but not needs more depth,"This book covers many different types of techniques for data mining but doesn't give lots of details on some of the techniques. I was looking for inductive learning algorihtms (ID3, C4.5, C5.0) and didn't find them here. For the techniques with depth the depth is in the form of formulas rather than examples."
3,"Original, but not competitive","I actually like the authors' writing style, but am put off by what I see as a ""neither here nor there"" quality of the book: sometimes it seems to be talking to beginners and sometimes to experts, sometimes it's very high-level, and sometimes goes into very basic detail - and sometimes promises detail, but does not deliver. (Take the case-studies chapter). I would not recommend the book to a beginner, and I am not sure that experts are going to find many ""takeaways"", once the serious-looking content is suitably filtered. The unreasonable price - come on, Bishop's ""Pattern recognition and machine learning"" costs less than this plain, thin, fairly old book - helps make it a ""pass""."
4,I like - U2?,"Is this U2? It took me a while to figure it out. A decent tune - This is where U2 should have been before their ego and self-indulgence took control of their music. There's actually some creativity happening here, unlike some of the mediocre commercialism they've been pumping out in recent years."
4,Educational but a tough read,In just 300 pages the book provides a rich overview of the history of the peoples of Africa. It sheds light on so many areas and corrects a host of misconceptions I had. I enthusiastically recommend the book but I rated it only four stars because it is a slow and dense read. You will need to be highly motivated to finish it.
4,Great introduction,"This book was a superb overview of the history of Africa. For the great length of history and great geographic area that this book covers in only about 300 pages, Illife does a fantastic job of ensuring that the reader is familiar with the great events of African history, spending just the right amount of time on each topic and always sure to discuss the various economic, political, cultural, religious, etc. factors of each period and place. For those who know little (as I did) about the history of Africa and want to begin to learn more, this is definitely the book to start with."
4,Good Overall History,"This is a good overall comprehensive history of Sub-Saharan Africa. I wouldn't use it for getting a better understanding of Northern Africa as his focus on demography paints a laconic picture of this region. For a more contemporary historical overview, I would suggest Fred Cooper's, Africa Since 1940."
4,Careful ordering during hot temp weather,"I love these bars and use them as meal replacements (with a piece of fruit) when I'm busy. I ordered these in July and they melted in shipping, so are very messy to eat. The melting also caused the moist part to leak out, so it is hard to eat and doesn't taste as good as it should.Yummy treat, just be careful ordering in warm weather..."
5,"Great taste, healty, good price","I just tried two of the balance bars and they taste great. But that's not what made me invest in balance bars. It was the fact that they DO NOT USE SUCRALOSE(SPLENDA) which is an artificial sweetener. I must warn all buyers that artificial sweeteners are NOT HEALTY and many of them have been known to cause major health problems. Even though SPLENDA is new on the market, it hasn't been throughly proven NOT to cause problems and there has been some studies on animals that prove that it does cause problems (i.e. cancer). It hasn't been proven to cause problems to people YET, but I do not want to be the guy who proves that it is bad for them (i.e. guinnea pig). Bottom line, read the fine print. If it says SUCRALOSE, buyer beware! Enjoy these great tasting, healty bars at very reasonable prices."
1,"Balance Bar Gold Carmel Nut Blast are plain awful when old, but not expired","I ordered the Balance Bar Caramel Nut Blast for my 91 year old mom who eats one every morning at 10:00 a.m. I have ordered from Amazon for years and just thought this would be so much easier to have them delivered to her mailbox. She was skeptical, thinking she would be getting old bars and you proved her so right. The first two cases were so hard, dry, the chocolate was white, I have never eaten anything so bad and I am a backpacker. Needless to say, I had to cancel her subscribe and save on them. She wasn't about to trust Amazon to send her a fresh box of Balance Bars."
2,Watch for expired product,Sadly I ran into a situation I wouldn't expect from the likes of Amazon - receiving protein bars with expired best before dates. Suggestion? Don't forget to check the best before date!
3,Not a bad Nutrition/Protein Bar,"The Caramel Nut Blast Balance bars are not a bad protein or nutrition bar, but they are nothing special either. As far as taste goes they are mediocre being kind of basic and bland. These do have a high amount of protein, 13g (28% of daily recommended value) which is a nice amount. The bars run a little on the small side (about 1.75 oz) and kind of high for calories at 210. Overall, I feel like the bars are just OK compared to others out there, and I would not likely purchase them again. There are plenty others out there that taste better, have fewer calories, etc. even other balance bars."
3,They changed the taste,This year Balance Bars got a new look and smaller bars. They changed the taste of Caramel Nut Blast. The new bars are not as tasty as before. They used to be more firmer to eat. Not sure why they changed the formula.
5,Original Recipe is back!!!,I just discovered that Balance Bar has returned to the original recipe for their Caramel Nut Blast bars! It's nice to know that they took the complaints to heart and went back to the original formula! I'm back to being a loyal customer.
1,Gold Bar Peanut Butter,"This is a good product, but the pkg. I received all of the bars seem to be old, they are very dry, would not buy this product againg from Amazon will purchase from the store."
1,How old are these bars?????,"I thought I would purchase the Balance Bars online, save myself a trip to Whole Foods. The bars came within 2 days ( amazon.prime member) and they are AWFUL!!! They taste old - the chocolate coating looks as though it melted and rehardened - it has a white powdery look to it. The bars taste stale. It's not worth the postage to return them, I tossed them in the garbage. Waste of money. Stay away from ordering this product online or from this vendor."
2,"Clearly ""Seconds""!","These bars are not ""retail"" quality. They were mashed and the caramel was stuck to the inside of the wrapper and they appear to have gotten hot at one time. Save your money and buy quality. Amazon should know better!!"
5,My favorite energy bars,"OK, so I've tried a lot of energy bars and these are certainly my favorite. They have a nice mix of nutrition and good taste. They honestly taste almost like a candy bar, they are pretty sweet but that's a good thing in my opinion! I just wanted to write a review to say I love this product.That being said, I have not ordered them online because I can get them for the same price locally, but if I lived out in the sticks I'd probably order these online because I have to have them! I eat 1 a day, it's the perfect snack between meals."
5,Great Taste!,The taste of these bars is amazing! Great source of protein and a wonderful flavor...almost like eating a candy bar!
2,Poor delivery,"I love Balance bars and eat them all the time.. I saw that I could order them here for a slight discount and did... However, they arrived melted!!! I couldn't believe it and don't recommend ordering them for this reason! What a waste."
5,Taste really good!,"These bars taste really good (caramel is my one true weakness), and do a good job at quenching my hunger pains during days that I have to skip lunch. I also use them when I feel that I need a snack close to workout time."
4,Balance Bars,"I am torn on this review. I LOVE this product and every Balance Bar I have ever tried. But I can only find them on Amazon. That part is high ratings. I have them automatically shipped and they are always on time. The customer service is awesome. BUT....the last three boxes have one end of every single bar melted and stuck to the wrapper!!! I dont know if they are melting somewhere or what, but I hope they can get the quality back."
4,high protein bar is very filling,"These bars taste pretty all right. The main part, which is chewy and smooth in texture, is topped by a layer of ""caramel"" with peanut bits, and the whole thing is covered in ""chocolate"". The chocolate doesn't taste like real chocolate (it doesn't taste much like anything, but it holds the bar together and looks like candy). But the caramel does taste like real caramel and has a similar texture.Because they are high in protein, the bars are also quite filling. I usually eat one when I leave work, so that I don't feel hungry right when I get home, and can take the time to cook a real dinner.Some things to watch out for: they are sticky to chew, I usually need to have water to drink while I eat one. They melt when it's hot, and if you mash them (e.g. stuff them into the bottom of a bookbag) the chocolate coating cracks and the caramel oozes out. Still edible in these cases, just messier.Overall I really like them."
2,God-Awful Texture!,"The taste is palatable, but the texture of the bar is like a mealy, congealed piece of molasses. It sticks in your teeth, and is certainly not a treat to bite into or chew."
2,watch the best before dates!,Sadly I ran into a situation I wouldn't expect from the likes of Amazon - receiving protein bars with expired best before dates. Suggestion? Don't forget to check the best before date!
1,Balance Bars are Great...when they aren't expired,"Before you order Balance Bars from Amazon, just be warned that you will get product that is past its ""best by"" date. I received a box last week that had expired in November. They replaced this with a box that had expired in....November. If you live near a Sam's Club or a Walmart get them there....they are just as cheap and much fresher."
1,Why did I not heed the other reviews?,Three different flavors - two boxes at least nine months past the expiration; one a few months. Returned for replacement. Received replacements with the same expiration dates. This is the first problem I have ever had with an order placed with Amazon. I'd be wary of buying food items from Amazon again.
2,Balance Bars,"Don't order these from Amazon. I thought I would save a buck or two by ordering from the, but when they arrived, they had obviously been melted, and then reformed at some point. I ordered two cases of the Triple Chocolate Chaos, and the ""gooey chocolate"" layer had melted, and the box had been turn on it's side, as this layer re-formed at one of the chocolate bar. It was a mess to eat, and 75% of the bar was dry and missing most of the chocolate."
4,Excellent source for protien tobuild muscles,I started to eat s'mores becausI needed a source for increasing my protien intake. They are tasty and a great snack.
4,Triple Chocolate Decadence!,"These protein bars are the ultimate in indulgences. They are extremely chocolatey in flavor, the texture is soft and moist like a brownie, and the chocolate fudge layer inside of the bar takes you over the edge.If you're needing a chocolate fix, this is it. Getting in 14g of protein at the same time is also a great benefit. I love these bars-- addicting and delicious!"
2,My First and Final Balance Bar Gold.,"My grocery store has a set of bargain shelves where they place items with deep discounts (up to 50% off) and I always look it over. This evening, I found a couple cartons of Balance Bar Gold so I bought one out of curiosity. It was the Caramel Nut Blast. Well, I've never liked nutrition bars anyway, but this thing was awful. The interior was something like chewy sawdust with a thin topping of caramel. The bar was coated with one of the worst chocolates I can remember. It was all I could do to get this bar down. No wonder it was on a deep discount sale. I can't see any real reason for eating this thing on the nutrition label. Certainly you wouldn't eat it for the taste. There must be something good about it, you would think. Well, it's 210 calories per bar and I could think of a lot better ways of spending it. This will be the last one of these. Trust me.Gary Peterson"
1,Too much pornography,"I bought this movie because I thought it was a Christian movie. But after watching it for just a few moments, I realized that this was not a movie that i would ever want in my house. There is way to much pornography and sexual perversion. What the women do with each other in the movie is abominable."
4,This is a good product!,"I was really skeptical about getting this steamer after reading all the negative reviews but I have to say the only thing I don't like about this product is that it holds such a small amount of water. It works almost as well as it says it does on the infomercial (I tested it on my filthy grill and It took 3 refills to get it completely clean!), I had great success removing the soap scum from the shower and was able to get rid a mildew stains (again having to use several refills), and it works reasonably well on clothes and the furniture. I was fortunate to find this at my local Target store (with the floor kit) for only $35 after tax. For such a small amount of money, I am thoroughly pleased."
4,I'm having fun with my Scunci Steamer,"This is my first day using my new Scunci Steamer, and so far, I've had no problems. It works really well, the only ""con"" is that I couldn't get all the dirt underneath my toilet rim off. Other than that, it's been fun using it. I haven't had any problems with the handle getting too hot, either. I look forward to using it for other household functions. :)"
1,Worked for 2 hours - then stopped forever,Wow... You'd think I would have learned something from buying the X-ray specs when I was a kid. I should have known better. Shame on me.
1,Do not buy this item!!!!!!,I just received this item and tried to use it in the bathroom. The steam not only comes out of the nozzle but also the trigger that you press down. The handle becomes so hot with the steam that you can not hold it. I put on dishwashing gloves to use this item and it was still too hot to handle.I called Scunci to see if the item was defective they said to use it without the attachments. What good is it if you can't use it with that attachments. I listened to what they said tried it without but the steam still poured out of the trigger making it impossible to hold.Please do not buy this product!!!!!!!
1,JUNK!!!,Got one of these and what a mistake. Total junk. Looked at them steamers at vapor-systems.com and contacted a lady on the testimonial page. They seem much better. Man o man are they expensive though. Don't know how we can afford one but we're saving. Steamers are the way to go without chemicals. Forget this junk though.
1,Terrible Buy,"Believe what you read in the other reviews. I received the steamer and I couldn't wait to use it. The upholstery and clothes attachment worked OK, but when you put on the attachments which hook up to the small nozzle, it SCALDS you, the trigger and the crack under the trigger emit steam. Burned my hand and returned the steamer according to their instructions. That was 3 months ago, and, despite repeated requests, I still have not receieved another. DON'T BUY IT!"
1,P.O.S. (i.e. Do Not Buy),"Despite the other negative reviews, I figured I should at least try this steamer. At $60, it is a total waste of money. From it's un-ergonomic design to it's worthless cleaning ability, (not to mention it's incredibly loud) I am returning this crap and getting my money back. It barely got the wrinkles out of a cotton shirt and did nothing to my filthy oven OR the grout in my bathroom. Oh well. Guess I'm back to elbow grease and my $60 back in my pocket."
1,Scunci Steamer isn't that great!,I have tried it in the bathroom without much luck there. I tried to clean tennis shoes without luck. The only thing that it has helped on is cleaning the grout in my tile floor. I didn't have the problem of steam coming out in other places than the nozzle and it isn't hot to hold. I'm considering returning the steamer.
1,only thing it does for me is blow away dust,"Don't waste your money on this. After watching the commercials on tv I was anxiously awaiting it's arrival. It does nothing that it does on the commerical. No matter how long you steam it does not get rid of grime, grease, mold or mildew. It does blow away dust and dirt in crevices however. But my vacuum attachment does the same thing. It is being returned today."
1,Scunci Steamer return to sender,I just received my Scunci Steamer and cannot get the attachments to attach to the base unit. I push and push and turned like the directions said but they will not stay. It is going back just as soon as I can get a hold of their customer service.
1,useless piece of junk,All the negative reviews on this board are nothing but the TRUTH. This is a piece of junk. I brought this product to remove the stain from my bathroom tiles. The steam lasted about 15-20 mins and I cleaned 4 tiles. Well...it only managed to get little bit of stain out. This product is nothing like what they showed you on their comercial. I am gonna return this piece of junk and donate the 50 bucks to the children's hospital.
3,I ordered one but have not rec'd it yet,I will be anxious to get it. If I am not pleased it will go back. I have had several friends that swear by them. So we will see. I was hoping to use it on astainless steel stove/oven. Has anyone tried it for this purpose?
2,Cleans the crud around the faucets,"I think people need to understand that this product is not for heavy duty cleaning. If you are looking for something cheap to clean the crud around your sink faucets or if you want to clean a small floor area, this steamer does a half decent job. However if you are looking to clean all the large floors in you home you should consider something like the Bissell Steam Mop. It costs less and does not use chemicals and what you save by not buying chemicals will more than pay for the mop. Now if you want to do the whole house (floors, tub/shower, kitchen cabinets, windows, stove, refrigerator, etc) one of those steamers at vapor-systems.com has the punch and capacity to tackle just about everything you have. But forget the Comet spray stuff for the bathroom. It will make you dizzy. Also if you switch to liquid soap and throw your bar soap away your shower will stay a lot more scum free."
1,BEWARE OF AMAZON RENTALS!!!,"Beware of Amazon rentals and read their fine print carefully! I have for many years enjoyed Amazon Prime and their great customer service, but this makes me feel like it is Amazon CRIME not PRIME.... They do not include supplemental CDs that are included with the book... NOTE I am not talking about access codes or numbers, but CDs that have are part of the book. Amazon would not give one with a CD nor would they refund for the book, so you basically have a paper weight and no solution for your class (plus out the cost of a insufficient product rental).. When we called about it, we were taken through several menus, to a FAQ page that way at the bottom said Amazon did not guarantee supplemental material with rentals... Wow, that is good upfront business, advertise huge and large, rent this from us, but hide in the small print you don't get the same product... so RENTER BEWARE..."
4,I enjoyed it.,If you like movies and want to know what goes on behind the scenes-you'll enjoy it too. Now when I watch the movie I appreciate it a bit more.
4,Really good case,"I've had this case down to 130 ft and it worked like a champ. It comes with a very small 5g Tube of silicone for the O ring. If you don't do much diving this isn't a big deal but I go every other day and it's about gone already. I dropped it the other day from a bout 3 ft and the case stood up to the fall, no cracks or leaks. It's one tough cookie."
1,I am a fan of Animie but....,"I am a huge fan of animie but when you get this be cautious it is full of ""Fan service"" Aka Nudity....I could not focus on the story due to the fact it all was leading to alot of nudity and leading to a reason to have nudity...I enjoy great Animies I don't mind a little ""Fan Service"" but to go this far makes you not realy focuse on any fighting any action nor any story...Alot of people enjoyed this and I would have Minus the nudity.The story If you can focus on it is a good story and the action is awesome but it dose seem they were attempting to put ""Fan Service"" where ever they could and it was hard to take this movie any more serious then a soft core porn...Bottom line Good story, lots of action but so much nudity that it takes from those things...."
4,Queen's Blade,"This is a fighting anime. With women showing a lot of skin when they start their battles (The cover art gives you an idea) and usually their armor gets cut to shreds to show what starts covered. It also tosses in some bath and prisoner scenes to offer a variety for the clothing optional parts of the story.The story itself is a little more innocent. The first couple of episodes are a bit mature in terms of violence, including one episode where almost everyone but the main characters die. After that, a typical episode includes a bit of sword fighting, a bit of drama, a bit of comedy, and in the end the fighters tend to come to an understanding or get separated in some way without anyone being seriously injured let alone dieing. If you're looking for a anime with women fighting each other while wearing little and with a feel good story to go along with it, this is the anime for you."
1,not worth our,The dialogue was terrible in fact it was so poor I lost interest in the movie. Regardless of the fact that occasionally you see a partial nudity not worthy of its mature rating. The action scenes seemed to lack basic things like angles or dynamic lines which made it seem boring. It's sheer lack of dept and creativity just makes this a cheap excuse took see hot anime chicks partially naked. If you want anime with amazing story and real hot anime action I recommend kite uncut.
5,A great series,I am new to the anime scene. My wife and I both like this series. The artwork is top notch the story is more than just good. There is a fair amount of nudity that we think adds to the story and in places the humor but is not for kids.
5,just kickin back,I have listened to the cd and i enjoyed it very much. I wish he had more cd.It was very refreshing. I will enjoy it for years to com.Thank-you
1,"IT""S A FAKE NOT EVEN THE REAL CD FOR $26.00","REALLLY DISAPPIONTED SPENT $26.00 FOR A FAKE/ COPY CD NOT EVEN THE REAL CD , REALLLY ,REALLLYY SURPRISED AMAZON WOULD DO THIS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. PLUS IT CAME SCRATHED BAD. DON""T BUT IT IT""S A RIP-OFF."
5,Teen mystery,I've started reading some teen books before I give them to my grandchildren and have found that I really like them. This one on the other hand was lame and I felt poorly written. It was alright but it was so predictable and I think even a young teenage would feel the same.
4,Repositionable Adhesive spray,"I use this spray on my cricut machine mat to help hold the paper on; It seems to work well, doesn't take much to hold it down well. I am please with it."
2,I was really wishing for better Mac version...,"I'm a huge Wipeout fan ever since it was one of the first true 3D hardware-enabled titled for the PC. Besides the PC, I've played versions for the PS2 and Nintendo 64. Upon seeing this for the Mac, I just about went nuts and ordered a copy. Nothing but disappointment since. I've tried running it on my older PPC Mac (OS 9.1), but it doesn't like my 3DFX card very much, the frame rate studders quite a bit, and the graphics have a washed-out look. Moving over to my more modern G4 Cube and OSX, the frame rate problem goes away, but the graphics are still very washed out with a 'gray' tone to them along with bad visual effects, like the explosions and hovercraft vapour trails. Network playability also only appears to work under OS 9.1, I haven't figured out how to get the option enabled under OSX. This is not the same quality game I remember from my earlier PC and console gaming days, so far just a big letdown."
5,great resource,"Lots of nifty pictures. A few too many naked winged toddlers for my taste, but I'll live. Just looking through the book gives me ideas."
1,"Great idea, terrible quality","I love the idea of these frames. They seemed a wonderful gift idea, and I bought one for each of my pets and as gifts for a friend. The problem is that they are very poorly made. I have purchased 4 of these in the ""natural"" color. Every single one of the frames has fallen apart. Hang them on the wall and the cheap wood and poor construction can't handle the weight of the glass - the four pieces of wood that make the frame will begin to seperate from one another after less than a month and send the whole thing crashing to the floor. As soon as it hits the floor, the frame breaks off into four seperate pieces and you will be left with a mess. Wood glue and reinforcing with brackets doesn't work as the cheap wood just splits.If they were about half the price, I'd recommend buying them for the paw print kit, matting, etc, and purchasing a box frame seperately. But for $30 + shipping, these things are an incredible rip-off."
3,They don't make 'em like they used to,"My mom's free cell finally broke and it turns out they don't make that brand anymore. I tried this one, paid a lot and she has not been able to figure out how it works."
3,Freecell Touch,"Its okay, but I didn't like it because the stylus pen was too difficult for people at the senior center to grasp. It would work great for people whose hands and fingers weren't swollen."
3,Bicycle Illuminated Touch Pad FreeCell,"I'm a real fan of this game, Big Screen Free Cell, and recently realized that the manufacturer (Radical) no longer made it anymore. I found this one on Amazon, it's nice and plays OK but isn't as good as the Radical game. I wish Radical would reconsider and bring back their previous version of this game..."
2,not easy to play,"The screen is lighted, but must still have light to use the touchpad. It is sometimes hard to get the stylus to work on the touchpad, sometimes needs a very hard touch. The ""new game"" point is too easy to touch when playing a game, which results in losing the one being worked on. It is light and easy to hold, but having to hold the stylus in just the right position makes it difficult to play multiple games."
3,Not a good book to study with,I taught a course with this book and there are several typo's in the book.
5,Greatly entertaining book!,This book is great for kids to see where exactly their turkey dinner comes from! A lot of us take for granted that our food is just there - not what has to be done to get it there and this is a delightful story for young and old alike. It is truely the essence of being thankful for animals.
4,Thanksgiving Twist on a Classic,My kids are familiar with the classic story 'Twas the Night Before Christmas. This book is a Thanksgiving adaptation of that classic book. It's a cute story of kids who take a field trip to farm and end up befriending turkeys. When they discover what the axe is for they smuggle the turkeys home with them. The kids enjoyed this book (even my daughter who had already heard the story in school that same day).
5,I loved this book way back in elementary school.,"And I love it now. I'm 26 and I'm not a thief, vegan or an Eco-terrorist.Oh and I love turkey. It's really good.That being said, I think this book is cute and fun and I'm buying it for my nephews."
5,Seasonal favorite,Each year I read this book to a few classes in my school library. This year I am in a new library so I get to see the reactions of new students. Today I read it to ELL classes so the pictures really told the story more than the words and some of the humor went over their heads. But they loved Mack Nugget and the turkeys under the shirts. It's a wonderful holiday read and recommended for kids of all ages.
2,Spoil an American Family Tradition!,I did not enjoy this book! I do enjoy the American Tradition of celebration Thanksgiving with a big Turkey dinner. If you plan on celebrating in a similar fashion then don't read this to your kids before sitting down to dinner or I guarentee you'll have plenty of leftovers!
5,My nephews love this book.,"Written for young children who may or may not be vegetarians but who love animals. Dav gives young artists an extra treat my cleverly incorporating Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" and Vincent Van Gogh ""Starry Night"" into some of the illustrations. His depiction of the teacher is hilarious. I swear my sister, a speech and hearing therapist for a Cleveland school posed for them."
5,Just Fun!,"I work in an inner city school in NYC that has many new arrivals , mostly from the Dominican Republic. They come with a limite understanding of many of our American hoildays! I found this a perfect book to tell about an American Thanksgiving!"
5,Pilkey is awesome!,"Trust me, if you are looking for a book that kids (and adults) will love, one that has humor, wit and great characters, you can NEVER, EVER go wrong with Dav Pilkey. I laugh out loud every time!"
1,Pathetic left wing agenda book teaches kids to steal and hate farmers,"Is this book for left wing PETA loving vegetarions ?... I had to check on this book after my son returned it from school, and I will tell the school to get rid of this horrible book that teaches kids to steal by putting things under their shirts. This is pathetic like the people who give this book a high score. Shame on you all.This author intentionally tries to make farmer look bad like they enjoy killing animals. This is NOT A GOOD BOOK. It is left wing extreme.It don't even rank 1 star. It ranks going to the trash bin, or for those environmentalists, it goes to the recycle bin to make to better reading material."
2,Beautiful artwork and color unsure about the content for children,"I was very pleased with the artwork and color, but suprised when I read about and saw the ax and the children with tears . This was horrifing to me! Why do we need to show such graphics for a book that was written for preschool age children. I was hoping to be able to read this to my 2 1/2-4 year old daycare children, but am now questioning if this book is really appropriate to read to such young children. If I do, I will deffinately have to edit or add my own revised standard version to make it more toddler/preschool friendly."
1,Why do I have to even give it one star?,"This book puts forth the idea that eating meat is evil, that farmers love killing, and that stealing is okay. As a preschool teacher and a farmer's daughter I have serious issues with this book. Butchering animals for food is not something anyone enjoys doing. It is a chore. There are much better ways to approach promoting vegetarianism with out vilifying those of us who choose to eat meat. There are much better ways to protest the killing of animals than stealing them.Another reviewer compared this to Snow White who enters the dwarfs house uninvited and cleans everything. The difference here is that Snow White did not damage property or in anyway hurt the dwarfs financially. She also stuck around and took responsibility for her actions."
4,Roman Catholic history,"I recommend this book for its perspective. The author presents a thorough historical account of the subject which is informed by the traditional Roman Catholic viewpoint. As time goes by, and historical revisionism and cultural change accelerate, this books serves as a good recounting of the deeds of Philip II who stands out as one of the aristocratic heroes of a formerly united Christendom."
4,Jester Costume,This costume was exactly as advertised and can be mixed with other halloween items or mardi-gras.
3,Alias John Law,"This was an interesting movie, was wondering where it was filmed ? Looks like Shoshone falls Idaho . Any guesses?"
2,don't bother,"The choice of music was poor and the transitions between scenery too fast. Some highlights of flight was enjoyable but not enough to hold attention the entire film. I guess if I viewed this at an IMAX theater it would probably have been more of a ""journey"". Felt more like a travel commercial instead."
2,fine until it died,"I've had this 1 year and 3 weeks, about 100 hours use, and it quit. Bought a new bulb but apparently that is not the problem. Ott says they will fix it, though I must pay shipping both ways, and I *think* the repair would not cost me. I found the lamp useful and liked the light quality. May be worth repairing."
5,Great Christian books for preteen boys,"Our grandson reads these books. He's 9. He absolutely loves the adventures and we can be sure there's nothing in there that a 9 year old shouldn't read, in fact, the opposite. They teach very good morals, which proves you do not have to have all the junk and bad language to create a good book.I have since sent 6 of them to a boy who has disciplinary problems and is getting special counceling in a special school. Much better than computer games and Wee don't you think? I just heard on the news that boys are way behind girls in reading, and I think computer games has a lot to do with this country's downward spiral. Not only that they don't read, but the content of those games is appalling.Some things never go out of style, like good basic jeans, these books are forever!"
5,Better than Nikon and cheaper too!,"This review is silly. Read the subject again. Yep, that sums it up. This has a higher capacity than Nikon's D1 series battery (2400mA/hr vs. 2000 mA/hr) and it costs less.I bought three of these.I'm happy.Cheers!"
1,AVOID! You've been warned.,"This is the same concert as the ""Columbia: Live at Missouri University"", with one exception: it's only 10 of the 14 songs. Get the Columbia CD -- it's five stars.What a rip off this is."
2,would rate it five but for one show stopper(and it's very annoying),"This is a game about pirates and you play a swashbuckling hero on both land and sea missions, + shuttle craft Galleo(lol = dingy) it is very fun and exillerating until one dampening element, an ""instant mission failure"" when you try and take the Hawkwind from Blackbeard and are forced back on your ""dingy"" after a difficult battle aboard the Hawkwind(and on Captain or Admiral difficulty, you can understand my frustration) you are awarded no save except an ""autosave"" that states ""mission failure""(chapter 3-3) the instant you set out on your dingy after getting the boot from Captain Blackbeard. Supposed to be ""Blackbeard betrayed you and you must avoid his ship before it heads full mast to gun you down"" instead(sometimes, quite frequent) you will get ""mission failure"" five seconds after the ""mission"" starts. W.A.B.!!! J.F.C.!!! W.T.F.!!! B.S.L.!!!"
4,Best game,Tortuga is a amazing game you play as a pirate named Hawk and you used to be a part of Black Beards crew but you sneak off the ship and take back your ship the Hawkwind and you meet a girl that you fall in love with. But you get to comand your ship and take down black beard and the English and the Spainish.
2,"Good as a thriller, but one-sided","Patriot Games is certainly a powerful thriller. The book catches you up and sweeps you along in its flow. However, there are some rocks in that flow. Tom Clancy seems to consistently take only one side of all the issues at hand - and while this is common in thrillers, in this book it reaches extremes that almost sickened me. There is a general refusal to acknowledge that terrorists or rebels ever have a cause or a reason to do what they are doing other than greed. The IRA are portrayed as evil murderers without a shred of conscience, and the protagonist Jack Ryan frequently goes off into philosophical reflections on how horrible and evil terrorists are (e.g., they can't face a ""real"" army, they always murder innocents, etc.)It could be argued that thrillers cannot funciton without some bias, but I think Tom Clancy takes it too far."
5,A Great Read! One of Clancy's best!,I Highly recommend this book but read Hunt For Red October First. It better introduces you to the Jack Ryan series. Anyway this is the best clancy book. Its like your there in the situation the way clancy writes. Read THIS BOOK!
5,One of the best that I have ever read!,"This book couldn't have been written better. Clancy's sense of realistic terrorism in this book is simply the best, and nobody can argue with that."
5,Action is the name of the game,"As far as I am concerned, this is by far the best novel Tom Clancy has written. Jack Ryan is back and better than ever with a fast paced action story that keeps you turning the pages. If you are one of these people that just ""sees the movie"", you are missing the real action. Harrison Ford is great as Ryan but the (movie) story loses a lot of the real meat of the story and even eliminates song of the strongest characters."
4,Suspensful,"Set in the early 1980's, this book talks about how a history teacher who interfers in an assination attempt in London, England, by the IRA, becomes a member of the CIA and what he does and goes through in order to save his and his family's life from an extremist group in the IRA, and how their personal judgement determines the outcome of the book. You also get a hint of the power that Jack Ryan will eventually possess later in the series. You also get a look into the mind of a terroist and how they react to situations. All in all, a excellent book Worth reading! Action, suspense, Romance, and suspensful ending!"
3,"A good read, but a step down.","Patriot games is a good book, make no doubt about it. It is as exhaustivly researched as any of Clancy's books, and the ULA provides an interesting and capable enemy. In Hunt For Red October, There really was not much of an 'Enemy'. Yes the Russians were the bad guys, but it was not as personal a book as Patriot Games. This is all about revenge, pure and simple. This does make it hard for Clancy to do what he does best, layer innumerable plots, all interweaving and eventually forming a cohesive whole. While the relative lack of manny subplots makes Patriot games a bit easier to read and comprehend then some of Clancy's other books, the Revenge Thang does get a bit old. Honestly, the finale is just not as gripping or as palm sweating as it could, and should, be. A good book, and still light years ahead of the competition, still, it has flaws. 3/5."
4,Jack Ryan's First Adventure!,"International terrorism is the topic Clancy tackles in his novel, 'Patriot Games.' When history teacher and sometime CIA anylist Jack Ryan intervenes in an IRA hit on the Prince of Wales, he soon finds himself a political target. When his family is attacked in Baltimore Ryan again goes to work for the CIA in the hopes of stopping the terrorists. While the story is gripping and the action scenes fast-paced and exciting, the first two hundred pages of the book are for the most part slow. If you're a patient reader you should get through it okay. The ending is a climax in the great Clancy tradition and the characters, as always, are people you'd like to know. There is much more in the book than in the movie, but it's essentially the same story. On the whole it's a great first ride for Jack Ryan."
4,Makes you feel like you're in the gunsights . . .,"This book, while not quite the same as Red Storm Rising, was nonetheless a great book! This is the intro for Clancy's main character, CIA analys/historian/Ex-Marine Jack Ryan. It starts out with a nice, calm walk in the park on a UK vacation, until a terrorist attack on England's Royla Family leaves Ryan a hero for thwarting the attack, his shoulder all banged up, and a target for the Ulster Liberation Army, a spinoff of the IRA. Now he finds that his family is endangered, with the terrorist suddenly operating in the IRA neutral country of America. When the terrorists make an attempt on his wife and kid, he resolves to not let them endanger him or his family again. But when a party with the original victims of the Royal Family is crashed by gun-toting Irishmen, Jack must fight to protect his family, his friends, and himself."
5,This a very exciting and suspensful book,Tom Clancy writes another excellent book. You can hardly put it down. This is an exciting book that I think you will enjoy
3,Another Clancy/Harrison Ford thriller.,"When you think of Patriot Games, you can't help but think of the movie. Harrison Ford and those white Chevy Suburbans getting shot up seems to be one of the more memorable scenes.This novel, like Clancy's others, adapts well to the screen. Therefore, if you want to get the core story in 2 hours, see the movie. If you want all the details, read the novel. Fast reading with an undercurrent of techno-thriller."
3,"Great book, bad copy-editing","I have read this book before and was excited to get it for my kindle. While the writing of the book is great, this version is plagued with many errors in the copying to kindle version. The person doing the copying obviously has not read, or not cared for the original because it has many errors that even a simple spell check would have caught. Most of the errors seem to be within the first few chapters, so once you get beyond them the book reads as it should. I have heard that other penguin publishing kindle books are also plagued with this problem. I may have to write them an angry letter as well."
3,Good and bad,"I wanted to like this one but got bored. The action scenes are great but too few and far between. The descriptions and dialogues are clever but tend to waffle on and on into eternity. Perhaps I was expectong something else when I bought this boom. I dont doubt mr Clancy's literary ability but have to say that boredom is not the emotion I want to feel when I select a book about terrorists going after the life and family of a normal citizen. Really I though I would get more action, more deception and more thrills. I have not given up on Clancy, however. I'm sure I will try another of his books. Anyway, beware that this book is not action packed, but when it does come, it is excellent."
4,Loved It!,"Intense but easy to follow. Took about two weeks to read, but we'll worth it! Looking forward to more Clancy soon!"
1,Unfinished,"Starting reading this book on vacation. Picked up my Kindle yesterday, but I only have half a screen on the display!So I don't know!"
1,Too simplistic,"Somebody mentioned Polly and the Princess. I could not write a more damning indictment. Of course, the british acted with ""fair play, old boy"" in northern Ireland, and the irish people are all foaming at the mouth terrorists, because they can't actually be anything else."
2,Patriot Games,"I thought Patriot Games was on OK book. It was really long, not that that matters, but it just droned on without really any plot to it. I didn't enjoy it as much as his other books and only would read another book of his because of Rainbow Six and the good reviews of that one."
1,Totally awful,"What is wrong with Clancy with this one? I have read Rainbow Six and The Hunt for Red October and thoroughly enjoyed them but I had to force myself to read this one. It is totally awful. It is slow and British people do not speak the way that he says they do. I've never heard one say ""chap"". Do NOT waste your time with this book."
4,My first Clancy novel. Still my favorite.,"After this I found Tom Clancy's novels unnecessarily long and sometimes rather boring when he goes into long passages of Military descriptions and technical info. There's fifteen pages in Executive Decision devoted solely to explaining how Jack Ryan is drinking his coffee. That's a bit much, and explains why his novel was over 1200 pages long.However before he went overboard Clancy struck gold with this one. Addictive, sometimes a bit boring but with a killer ending (literally!). Better than the movie. I own all of Clancy's books - this is still my favorite."
4,Patriot Games,"This is the first item of the Jack Ryan series. Before this, I read The Hunt for Red October, then I came to this. I thought that the story was great, and realistic. Although it does get boring in the middle, but do not throw the book away for that. It DOES get a great ending."
3,Exciting Finish,This book has a great finish - very exciting. The problem is that the set up takes too long and isn't that interesting. Is it really necessary that main character Jack Ryan has to lecture the Prince?
3,"Good, but not the best","The book is good but by far not his best work. I found myself wanting to finish the book quickly, not because I wanted to see the ending but beacause I wanted to start a new , better book. It's arguably worth reading but if you don't want to waste time but still want a clancy book read clear anf present danger"
3,"Reads like pre-""October"" Clancy","Easily the weakest of Clancy's thrillers--more than a little preposterous, presumptious and/or pompous at times. In large part the book feels like something from a less experienced but clearly talented author--say, a Tom Clancy in his pre-""Red October"" insurance-agent days. It wouldn't be at all surprising if ""Patriot Games"" is a rework of a draft that had been gathering dust for years in the Clancy attic."
3,This was boring in the begining!!,"This book has a good plot and exciting action (once you get past the first 200 pages!) I will admit that this book is a thriller, but it takes very long to get past the part where he's in the hostpital. This book is reccomended if you start in the middle."
1,Clancy is better than this!,"The ending of this book provides the excitement, but the first half is barely digestable. I mean, really, Jack Ryan telling the Prince of Wales off, give me a break! Tom Clancy is a great storyteller, but this one is a major dud!"
1,Beware -- This has nothing to do with Football,Read this through twice. No mention of the Superbowl.
5,Better than the movie in most respects.,"I thought that the book was of course better than the movie, except the ending was actually tighter in the movie. The Story of Jack Ryan, part time CIA Operative and full time instructor at the Naval Academy, who falls afoul of memberof the IRA who are trying to kidnap a Royal Heir. The story is told from a number of character viewpoints like most of Clancy's works. A thriller all the way through with enough explanation to satisfy those who want to delve deeperinto the intelligence community. Ryan is the hero who begins his long climb to the presidency."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"IRA attack.Jack Ryan accidentally gets involved with the IRA when he saves one of their targets from being killed because he just happens to be around and that is the sort of thing he does.This has serious reprecussions for him when he is minding his own business with his family and they come calling with an attack team.A decent, fairly intense personal level thriller.3.5 out of 5"
4,"Long book, with little action","If you are looking for an action packed book, this isn't the one for you. There are some very good action sequences in the book. But most of the time it just about Jack Ryan sitting around thinking about the terrorists.The beginning of the book starts out with a good action scene with an assination attempt on the British royal family. What comes after that was mind numbing. Pages and pages were written about Ryan being laying in a hospital bed. The rest of the book has a few action scenes, but not enough to really keep my attention for long.If action is important in your decision to buy a book, then this really isn't the one. But if you are a fan of Clancy, this one is worth the read to be able to compare it to his other books."
2,Book,"While the book was as advertised, hard bound, I wasn't aware of exactly what a turtle back was. Whne th book showed up, it was indeed hardbound, but the size of a paperback. I can't fault the vendor for my ignorance though. The service was prompt and the product was in the condition advertised"
5,Great Book! Exciting and Breath Taking,"Patriot Games is such a great book that deserves so many people's attention. Mr.Clancy has gone into great detail and it seems so real. When I was reading this book, my head had the pictures of the book as I read along parts with great violence and action. This book is truely a remarkable book and I have recommended to all my friends and my 8th grade teachers."
5,Best of Clancy's Bunch,"Every time I re-read Patriot Games I find a couple of more irregularities, but over all it's a great book. Full of action, but no lacking in character development.The irony of going back to early Clancy works is how it blows away his latest effort Rainbow Six. This makes me think he simply tried to bang out Six in as a marketing tool for the accomanying PC game."
4,This book is great!,Patriot Games is about the terroism in Great Britian and it also gives Jack Ryan a history. During a terroist attack Jack Ryan just happens to be in the area of the royal family and jumps in front a shot from the terroists. He is shot in the shoulder but is hired by the family has a bodyguard. This book is slow at the begining of the book but speeds up at the end. If you liked the other books in the Jack Ryan seires you should read this book.
4,I'm giving it 4 stars not bc of the dancers' abilities.,"Personally, I would not have cast David. I don't know how he won any competitions quite frankly. But I do like the series of patterns that these two offer. They do a good job of demonstrating the move with it's name and then breaking it down with an explanation. Additionally, they have other moves that they dance. They don't breakdown the extras, but you can glean a few new things from them if you're capable enough. Decent video, but the audio was rather muffled. I'd recommend it for the actual material presented, although their style isn't what I'd hoped."
3,Good selection,I would recommend this tape to anyone out there. The moves are excellant and well presented. If anything the lighting could have been better and there was too much space on the set such that the people seem to be too far back and you can't see their facial details. These are minor details however in the dance scheme of things. Good work overall.
5,"A video I will enjoy watching again, and again, and again...",I totally enjoyed this video. Lisa's dancing was wonderful - a level to aspire to. Dave's explanations were clear and well thought out. I especially liked the way he explained how to lead in a way that avoids injury to both the leader AND the person he is leading - I've danced with a few people I'd like to give this video to! I also like his use of slow motion on the most complex lift - very helpful. I will definitely look for more of their vidoes.
4,U2 Tries Dance Music,"To be honest I never really got the Popmart stage of U2. I'm thinking it was self-parody but maybe it was just too clever for me at the time.I was getting into electronic music in a big way around the time this came out so it was right up my alley. It's a great dance track, and on subsequent listening it's easy to hear the Elvis rockabilly influence under all the studio tinkering. In terms of opening tracks for albums, it's a real corker.The remixes here are pretty standard, with the DM Deep Club Mix being the strongest, a heady but orthodox house number with piano chords to match. The Holy Joe B-side forshadows the gritty direction the band would take with How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, and it almost merits being on the Pop album itself.A decent CD single but non-rabid U2 fans may be better looking to iTunes for these."
3,ok.....,The blade was just ok. It is very sharp but take caution if you plan on shaving with this blade being that it could cause itching and discomfort.
4,Holds up great,"Fast delivery and packaged great. I love these clippers for a close shave. Would have like better installation instructions, but I figured it out ok."
5,first rate,My old one had a broken tooth and was barely usable. The new blade is almost idiot proof with regards to installation. It works well and cuts cleanly.
5,works perfect,ubber cheap and works! nuff really saidpros:everything minus the lack of cake and grilled cheese.con:its sharp. i cut myself if i'm to handy with my hickory O_o
3,Does not fit on Canon SD20 Digital Camera,I found out the hard way that this lens does not fit on the Canon SD20 camera. I gave it away to a friend that could use it instead. Wish they would update this site to exclude this camera as being compatible when it isn't!
3,It doesn't fit the Cannon SD20,"It is a great little lens, yet it didn't fit the Cannon SD20, yet if you manually hold it in place it works just fine. Great for opening up shots and getting landscapes."
3,"nice sink, watch out for kohler stamp not being centered",Ordered two sinks. They came quick and look great except for one detail. On one of the two sinks the kohler stamp in the back of the sink is not centered. My installer pointed it out and after many measurements proved it wasnt installation but the kohler stamp. Didnt want to delay my install so i gave them the goahead to install so i could get my sink back in the bathroom. if i wasnt in a rush and had to deal with scheduling contractor return i would have returned it. Minor item but it is bothersome and is always staring at me when i brush my teeth. Make sure you check it out before mounting.
5,Works with my 40 ounce Klean Kanteen,"Perfectly happy with this cage. Though this heavy gage aluminum cage is a bit tall for my 40 oz Klean Kanteen bottle, it still holds the bottle snugly. Because of that, and the exceptional price, I gave it five stars."
3,Bring lots of water but limited durability,This cage works as advertised and can be adjusted to a number of 1.5 liter containers making it easy to bring a lot of liquid for longer rides. This is especially useful for paved road riding in Europe where 1.5 liter bottles are commonplace (in the US you have to look a little harder for suitable bottles but they are available).However I would not recommend it for rougher roads as the weight will distort the cage. Mine is warped while a friend had his break on off-road trails.
4,Works for wine bottles,"This works for wine bottles, or if you're a real man, bottles of mead. To be safe I wrapped the bottom aluminum part in electrical tape for some shock absorption."
5,Bratz Strut It! Cloe,"Strut It! Cloe is my favorite Cloe doll because she looks nicer than the other Cloes because she has light colored clothes ad makeup.Cloe comes wearing a light orange shirt, a denim skirt, a brown belt, a brown headband, orange shoes, and a denim purse. Her other outfit is a pink shirt, light denim colored pants, and pink shoes. I like both her outfits, and I think it's okay if Cloe wears pink sometimes, even though she has blond hair.This Cloe doll also has green eyes instead of blue! I like this eye color better because all dolls that have blond hair usually have blue eyes, but real people that have blond hair don't always have blue eyes! I have blond hair and green eyes, and my friend has blond hair and brown eyes! A lot of people have blond hair and a different color eyes. I hope they make more Cloes with green eyes. Why doesn't she ever have brown eyes?"
4,Good Toy,"This a great toy for me!I love it!I love Bratz,There clothes,there Spas and automobiles,and jewely for them,shoes, hairdressers,Bratz Boys,Purses,Shops for them,houses for them,Beds,longes,and more!!I have four Bratz i would love to have everything of Bratz,But i don't.You would love it!I bet you will."
3,"Great Toy, but.....","This was my first Bratz doll ever. I got it 2 years ago or something like that. I luved to play with her. And it was fun and all until the head came off. I put the head back on, but it wolud come off easily while I played with her. So I pressed the doll's head all the way down. It stayed and all but she looked like she had no neck, but I still played with her. Then, a few months after the head incident, my sister was playing with her and broke one arm. Now there was no way I could fix that. This doll's clothes were great. The only thing I disliked was the pink shirt. I just didn't like the way it looked on her. Now that it's 2 years after these 2 incidents, I noticed that Bratz dolls nnow are more durable than the ones in the before.Bratz Rulez!!!Peace OutBabygirl"
4,yeah,"I got this doll the Christmas I was eight. She lasted a year, but then last new year, I found that her arm had broken. I had no idea how it had happened, but I reccomend that you be very careful but do buy it! I hope you found this review helpful.p.s I have had one of my other bratz for a year now, and she hasn't broken. She is Funk out! Jade.-----------------------------------Yes, the older dolls are more breakable and the newer ones are better. Out of this collection I have Meygan and she still hasnt broken, but I am really carful with them, I am more of a protectior for them and I take care of my other friends dolls.My friend had(I have it now, I take care of it:P) a cloe,an older one andthe dolls arm fell off.... So I fixed it and It is somewere. So all I am saying is that the newer ones are more durable.Hope that helped!p.s. I have Meygan of this collection, a jade(cant remember which one) and a bratz funk out sasha."
2,This toy disappointed me...,"I bought this toy and it was great for awhile...until I checked everything out. Everything is soooo easy to lose and the feet look awful. Also, some of the clothes don't even fit! I was disappointed."
4,spring strut it,"Bratz strut it cloe is pretty fun.i play with her alot.she has the same name as me,witch is pretty cool.i also have the very first xpress it cloe.she's been such fun.you should buy her if you wan'tI like her cause she looks like me,and because she has cool clothes. signed'anonymous"
2,Bratz Dolls Make Me Sick!,"I'm sorry, but it's true. I'm 12, and I hate them. Why? Because they're inapropriate. (Sorry about my bad spelling) Their skirts are WAY 2 short, and the commercial 4 the Bratz Boyz made me puke when the jingle sang ""oh, ah, cuddle with the boys"" and one of the cartoon dolls strokes the boyz chin. Please, don't waist your time on this doll. Some of the clothes break easily. (I know cuz my BF used to like them, but now we use her as the snotty one when we play w/ our ""Whats-her-faces"" and the worst thing WHF dolls wear are bathing suits.)I'm not against ppl who like Bratz dolls, I'm just posting my opinion."
4,An excellent book,"Anne McCafffrey and Co. have written an excellent space opera - as good as any that I've read (and I've read alot!) Sassinak keeps you excited as she works her way through the ranks and outsmarts the bad guys. Lunzie isn't as much of a page turner, but that's just me. It left me wanting more.(Elizabeth Moon's Sporting Chance and Once a Hero series' are a good read and very similar world too)"
4,Good Read,"Anne McCaffrey's earlier works (pre Dragonrider) were a little bit harder to read due to some gaps left in the writing. The story doesn't fill out as much as some other books I've read (i.e. Enders War or Armor). I've read her other ""Planet Pirate"" books and found the same sort of jumping gaps in the story line. Subtle, but noticable if you've read other authors (better authors).I ordered this book used-good condition and recieved as described in good shape with no shipping damage. It was shipped quickly and I am satisfied with the purchase overall."
5,The Palney Pirate Series,"I personally enjoyed the entire series but I'm a pretty diehard Anne McCaffery fan. the only book that disappointed me has nothing to do with this partticular series, The Skies of Pern."
2,Generation Warriors,"This book, about a young girl captured and taken from her home and enslaved is about her fight to end the slave trade. It does not take a simplictic view of human society. It touches on how a people who view themselves as oppressed can thus justify terrorism and the explotation of others.It also ties together two other books, The death of sleep and Dinosour Planet, taking characters from both books and bringing them forward in time."
5,Great for those on the fence,"I (as a practicing solitary for more than 20 years) always recommend this book for those who want to learn more about me and my beliefs. It is a short book that is easy to read and it gives a general overview of our belief system for those who don't understand or who may think they want to follow a pagan path but don't really know what it's about. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is just starting out or for those who have non-pagan relatives who want to understand more about you and your belief system. Being the only pagan in an entirely Christian family it was easier for me to pass this book around than to try to explain over and over what and why I believe and worship the way I do. I have a few others that I recommend if those who read it want to learn more, but to me, it's a great starting off point."
5,Great start for beginning your journey,I found this book to be an inspiration as well as an educational resource. PAGAN WAYS touches on many aspects of the pagan religion and offers a non confrontational view into the life and ritual of the pagan. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the pagan religion.
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I know it's meant for a starter level on Paganism, but I was expecting the reading level itself to be higher toned. I got the impression throughout the book that the writer was addressing a child, possibly a very young teen ager. I'm an avid reader, and I could only make it halfway through this book before giving up on it. If you're looking for introductory books, there are definitely better ones out there than this one - though this is certainly not the worst I've read."
3,Informational,"This book gave me the look into the ways of Pagans and to a degree Wiccans. I have always been interested in the religion and I finally started to begin reading this book as a start to learning more about the religion. The author does a good job explaining everything clearly, he also gives detailed example to clarify rituals and so forth even more. I believe this book is a great start to learning about the religion, but I know that I will need to continue to learn more in order to recieve a full understanding of the religion. What I'm trying to point out is that this book won't give you the specifics of practicing the religion but a start at what the reigion is about."
5,This one really woke me up!,"Though obviously fiction, this book makes one exited about telling others about Jesus."
4,Almost a Manual,"... is a talented Christian writer and this book ""The Heart Reader"" is almost a manual in how to draw others to Jesus. The story came through as intended but on the whole the narrative was not as captivating as ... other work.This would be a good book to add to the church library.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
1,Appliance Touch Up - Didn't work,"Product didn't work well, was rather watery. In fact, regular white-out worked better. However, I contacted the company and they cheerfully refunded my money including shipping, no questions asked. So, they stood behind their product and no harm done."
2,misleading and inferior product,"the foam is cut too short for a normal bed. the picture shows two pillows and the ad refers to a pair, but only has one pillow.It would be great if it fit the bed. the worst part is i'm in Afghanistan so i cant return the product because it was vacuumed sealed."
2,memory foam mattress with two pillows,Not worth it if you are looking for something that will make a difference in your sleeping. I couldnt tell the difference that i had put it on. The pillows were the worst part too. I woke up everyday with neck problems and even a stiff neck one day. I ended up throwing them in the trash. Save your money and get a new mattress. .
2,Would not purchase this if I'd seen it,"This foam arrives in a ""shrink wrap"" which dis-figures the foam. Not a good quality either for the money.You can buy foam of same quality for much less....it is also advertised as coming with 2 pillows-the pillows are no more than 2 foam wedges of same poor quality and discolored yellow foam.Very disappointed. We ordered this to go inside a quality sleep number bed on our RV.We will not use this product."
3,Bad Cut,"The memory foam is comfortable, but it is cut at an angle and doesn't completely fit the dimensions of a twin size mattress."
4,"A Nice, BIG Anthology","Quite a nice anthology: Biography: Lytton Strachey: Queen Victoria (complete text) Novel: Thomas Hardy: The Return of the Native (complete text). A very nice selection of essays and poetry. Keats, Tennyson, Browning, Hardy, Masefield, Sassoon, Housman, Frost, Sandburg, Millay, Robinson, Yeats, Wylie, Lowell, Eliot, MacLeish. I've kept this book over the years and have used it often. 1258 pages."
1,It was my own fault,"I was looking for equipment to improve my Skype experience. When you select one item, Amazon generally advises two more ""Add these to Cart"". I did. When the device was delivered I plugged it in and turn it on. THEN I read the reviews. YES THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK.Next time, watch very very carefully what Amazon advises you might like."
4,good but very violent,this work the second in a series of 3 books is a very good with wonderful art and a excellent charater designs. but be warned it it very very violent almost to the point of being overdone. Granted violence in manga is very common but this brings it to a new level. definitly a good read just not for anyone under the age of say 12.
2,BARFLY THIS ISN'T,"A BIG FAN OF BARFLY, I WAS SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS FILM.PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF THE FILM WAS WHEN DILLON WAS DOINGVOICE OVER FOR THE FILM.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ""BORN INTO THIS"" WHICH IS FAR MOREENLIGHTENING."
1,Irrelevant Yawner,"This is just bad. Hamer's take on Bukowski is so far off, that it's almost comical. This film offers nothing revealing about Bukowski, his life, and his art. Everything about this is just plain wrong. Everything is just a bit too clean. The setting is modern day, which doesn't lend credibility to the basic storyline of the original novel. Even the soundtrack is completely wrong. Well, at least Hamer is consistent in his ineptitude of the subject matter. Dillon's performance? Whatever. To say this was a disappointment is an understatement. Check out the great documentary, ""Born Into This"", or even ""Barfly"", for a better intro to Bukowski. What a shame this film is..."
3,The words but not the soul....,As other reviewers have said the movie just doesn't have the soul of Bukowski writing. The actors are too pretty. The scenery is too clean. It's like Bukowski in Suburbia. It just doesn't feel right. There simply isn't the grit that Bukowski write about. In this despite a solid performance by Matt Dillon it comes off wrong. Overall I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because those who have read Bukowski would be disappointed and those that haven't would be given an incorrect impression of Bukowski's work.
3,never want to drink again after seeing this,"I do agree with a.reader's review regarding this movie: not much of a plot. But Matt Dillon's portrayal of the author, is very realistic. The performances are very real, it makes me horrified to see people in a state like this. Although it was semi-romanticized, the alcoholism is very well acted. I just can't believe that some people live like this!"
4,"Booze, cigs and weary waste","Matt Dillon gets the look right here, but his voiceovers fail him a bit, when he tries to draw out the weary quality of the Bukowski prose he's quoting from. Almost an Edward Hopper painting come to life in its anonymous downtown urban squalor scenes, the movie drifts along at a slow-paced comedic speed. I found many of the scenes funny, especially the numerous firings from dead-end jobs by angry bosses who catch Chernasky drinking on the job. Dillon smokes enough cigarettes and downs enough booze to age him a decade here, but he still looks pretty for his age. This sleeper is very much worth a watch."
3,"Booze, bookies, and books","The best thing about this downbeat movie is Matt Dillon's performance, which is perfectly pitched and marks a career high. He carries what is a slim tale with his shuffling, mumbling portrayal of the drunken aspiring writer. It's funny, sharp, and intelligent, but also, frankly, a bit depressing and sometimes dull. Given that this is based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Charles Bukowski we don't really learn as much about the writer as we might. We see his alter-ego lurch from one hangover to another, from one job to another, and from one woman to another but that's about it. The extracts from the writer's work that punctuate these motions only serve to tantalise. But perhaps that's a good thing, if it makes the viewer want to read Bukowski's work."
3,Pretty good but a little dissapointed,"First off, I love Bukowski and have been reading his poetry, short stories and novels for 25 years and was very interested to see Factotum.Matt Dillon plays the part of Henry Chinaski pretty well, but theres is something missing from Bukowski's alter ego on the screen. Dillon is just not quite gritty enough and seems to be just a little too vacant in my opinion. I don't want to give the impression that his performance is bad because it isn't and is probably one of his better performances, although I disagree slighly with how the part was played.I do recommend watching this if you are a Bukowski fan and the price is right for the DVD."
5,Great Film.,"If you are a fan of Bukowski, get this film. It does a great job of showing a small section of 'Hanks' life. Barfly is also a decent film, if you can swallow Mickey Rourke's voice. Great job by Dillon. When the credits rolled I thought I had been watching this for 10 minutes...."
2,Waste of time,"Since the greatest crime one could commit (according to Bukowski) was to waste his freaking time, this film is something of a curse.It's pretty lousy film making. If you're going to make a book out of something like FACTOTUM, you should at least be able to create something far more effective than this. While Dillon was really, really good in his portrayal of Bukowski, the rest of the movie is something of a train wreck. You never know where you're standing if you're unfamiliar with Buk's writing, and one feels completely let down if you are an admirer of the vast spread of Charles Bukowski's stories, novels, essay, and poems.Don't waste your time. There are plenty of better things to read and view."
4,this is a cult movie with some great pieces of dialouge ( a review for FACTOTUM),"a man who can,t stan his life . a man who can,t choose the right job for himself , he just try every job he can put his hand on .a man who can,t live a normal life . a man who can,t do anything right so he tried to write stories. this is the great simple story of this cheap simple fine film.you will feel lonely after seeing this one. it captures one man,s life real smoothly.dillon will blow your mind with his performance and he is as cool as vincent from pulp fiction_i mean the character_ .listen to the song ""it,s just a slow day"" at the end because it will blow your mind too.not for all tastes though."
1,Horrible movie,I kept waiting for a plot to develop! While Matt Dillon does a great acting job - the movie is horrible and a total waste of time.
1,Drivel,"From the first scenes, this movie screams ""Auteur, auteur!"" Bent Hamer joins all those other European directors with a camera and financial backing from a non-commercial source who film some slices of America low-life as if they have just discovered it. Let us enumerate the uninteresting things about this movie:1. The ""story"": the life of the protagonist, a loser and an albatross to those who cross his path2. The cinematography: static, uncreative3. The ""literary"" voice-over: the poetry illustrates Bukowski's richly deserved obscurity4. The script: no laughs, no tears, no development5. The acting: these poor people rattle off their lines as if they can't wait to get this over with, and we listen with similar enthusiasmThe only interesting question is how on earth they got Matt Dillon to tie this career anvil around his neck."
1,I'll save two hours of your time.,"Take the first 20 minutes of the movie and then imagine another 1.5 hours of the same: guy drinks, guy gets job, guy loses job, guy mistreats girl along the way. Dillon's character is unlikable, predictable, and just plain boring. This, combined with the absence of plot, makes for a painful viewing experience."
1,It does not work except for home videos,"I purchased this product thinking it would allow me to take my dvds on my ipod to see them. when you put a dvd in to be transfered, it will tell you all dvds are copy-protected and it can't copy! These people are misguiding thieves, they should specify that it is only homemade dvds!"
4,Change is Good,"After having had several automatic coffee makers (all of which made less than fantastic coffee) I decided it was time for a change. Living in Louisiana, I frequent New Orleans on a regular basis and so am very familiar with this type of coffee press. The rich, flavorful coffee from this type of pot spoils not only your taste buds but your nose as well. I was a bit leery due to the fact that I would have grind coffee beans and boil water first thing in the morning (I am NOT a morning person). The extra effort is well worth it. This pot is very convenient for people who like rich, dark brew but do be aware that if you drink a mug of coffee you're only likely to get two from this pot. The clean up isn't difficult but must be done by hand so it does require a little time. I find the quality of this press to be in line with what I have seen at upscale hotels in New Orleans, which undergo far more use in a week than mine will in a month."
3,"Nice looking, but difficult to clean.","This is a very attractive press, however to clean you must unscrew all the layers of screen and metal at the bottom. The 'blocking' feature in my opinion is not needed. It makes cleanup a pain. I'd prefer to be able to spray out the grounds after each use instead of completely taking it apart."
3,Much smaller than 8 cups,"This little carafe would be more accurately described as 3 cups rather than eight. Have a vintage, larger BonJour Monet French Press that holds six 8 oz cups to the top of the metal band (or eight 6 oz cups). Don't have a clue how they determined the 8 cup description for this tiny carafe.Liked the design of the Maximus pour spout filter to minimize coffee grounds in the cup. BonJour carafes and filter screens are more sturdy than Bodum. This is a pretty little French Press. BonJour replacement screens are very hard to find.Way too small for this household...returned."
2,Disappointed,"This french press is beautiful with a gimmick, the filter that opens and closes. The design of the press makes it difficult to keep the stainless steel frame for the carafe clean of water minerals without taking it apart and upping your chances of breaking it. If you lay your plunger on a counter or table, it has the tendency to roll off. The ball on the plunger unscrewed causing difficulty threading on the flange to the filter and realignment of the filter. (My husband put it in a vice to tightened the ball enough to thread the flange on the filter.) The press is top heavy. If the ball (top unit) would roll off and drop on your toes, it might break a toe. As for the filter that open and closes, to stop brewing. Come on! I have tried it both ways..... I can't tell the difference and I have discriminating taste buds. The press is beautiful but a frustrating disaster to use and maintain. Don't buy it."
1,"glass carafe explodes, pulling shards of glass from my 5 yo's skin","I wish I'd known before I bought this that it was not only a total waste of $[...] but that it would fail spectacularly and dangerously after two months. As my husband was filling the carafe with hot water, the glass exploded, sending glass shrapnel everywhere, as the kids stood nearby. Fortunately our toddler was not injured, however, I removed bloody jagged shards of glass embedded in my five year old's scalp and neck.We will be shopping for a stainless steel press. It's safer, and will cost less in the long run than something cheaply made.Update: we bought the Frieling stainless steel press. Beautiful, durable, excellent coffee, well worth the extra money.http://www.amazon.com/Frieling-Ultimo-Stainless-Steel-French-35-ounce/dp/B00009ADDS/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1285361011&sr;=1-1"
2,Broken glass after less than a year,"We've enjoyed this press and use it for both large and small amounts. The issue: it cracked around the seem where the top metal band goes around after less than a year's use (and we use it about 1-3x a week, not every day due to our schedules). It does not appear that the glass can be removed and replaced. While I understand breaking glass carafes is common for press pots, not being able to replace the glass is an issue."
5,Old Skool Gothic,"Bauhaus defined dark, poetic imagery in music way before ""goth"" was a household word as it seems today. It's a shame this collection is so hard to find, as I spent my impressionable teen years emulating the stark visuals found here. This is pure art reflecting the music's soul, not the typical billion dollar budget pop and flash of today's MTV culture. Peter Murphy thrashing at the end of the chain between the crushing walls has to be seen and the lightbulb as a major prop is highly underrated these days. Fossil goths, come back to your roots. Little gothlings and Mansonites, here's where the art of darkness lies."
1,I'm a little jaded...,"I bought this for the same reason anyone buys this product and I was quite satisfied with the way it worked. HOWEVER--please, save yourself the trouble I had and use it around a leg or an arm first. I had a severe allergic reaction to the neoprene and ended up in the emergency room."
2,Doesn't last long.,"I am happy that the waist trimmer does burn the fat around your tummy and make you sweat but the overall package might last you about a good week before it starts to come apart. The price is under $10 but I still expected there to be better quality in the product. If you are looking for it to last, this is not what you are looking for."
3,good but buy two,"I bought two because I read a review that it wasn't wide enought and I'm glad I did. Otherwise, very good especially for the cost."
2,Poorly done,"When I saw the reviews for this book, I expected a funny, insightful view of Washington from one of its most creative insiders. The book has its moments of humor (sometimes it even makes you think) but it has several typos and McCarthy repeats paragraphs, almost word for word, several times. Most parts leave the reader disinterested and disappointed. Not money well spent."
5,Energetic and Inspiring!,"This is a fine read -- for every great reader or writer. Donald Newlove has gathered from literature some of the finest first paragraphs ever written! The works of authors such as Isak Dinesen, Melville, and Hemingway are looked at in a wonderful way. This book is as energizing and inspiring as a savouring cup of coffee!"
1,Video falls short of expectations,"This video provides an ok over view of the state, a bit of its history and culture, and a good newsreel of the Pearl Harbor bombing, but it falls way short of its billing as ""5 Hawaii film Masterpieces."" Much of the video could be described as good overview for a jr or sr high school geography class, and much of the footage will remind the viewer of those movies in school that you always slept through. (The box even confirms that portions of the video are from the Hawaii school system.)Get a video by National Geographic or Time-life and get a better taste of the Aloha state. You'll tell me ""Mahalo"" (thank you) for the advice."
2,"not great quality, but where else can you find jewish dance??","This DVD and cd seem to be the edited 50 minute version of the original 90 minute ""Jewish Party Dances"" recorded nearly ten years ago. ( go read that review before you buy this) At least they cut out the mistakes. I am very disappointed with the quality of this DVD- unprofessional dancers who are still learning how to do the steps (the camera often remains on these people who are still uncertain of the steps).Your local Jewish/Messianic congregation would have done just as well to record their practice sessions. In fact, if you are into that sort of thing, you can save your money and just learn from your locals. At least you'll be able to look at your instructor's feet without getting too dizzy. The only good thing is that it is a rare find - jewish dance steps on DVD. If you had a group of friends who would learn along with you...it might be worth it."
3,Israeli Jewish Dance,"The video was okay. Not like I thought it would be though. Alot of repetition for a long set of time. Too long for me. I would've like to have seen more variety. But I still watch and if I can, fast forward to the next parts. The dancing is wonderful but it's just the time they spend on one area."
2,Israeli Jewish Dance,"I found this DVD to be of Not very good quality, I would not recommend, Just remember you get what you pay for."
5,better than expected,"Better than I expected. For the first time in my life I can skip the flat iron and curling iron, and walk out of the house without looking like Tina Turner! Beware this is a big brush. My husband calls it ""the weapon"" LOL. I have abundant, thick AND frizzy hair and it was made for me."
3,Brush great! but....,"The brush really does what i had expected it to do; dry my hair quicker and leave a great shine when done. The size is perfect even for really long length hair even though little strings of hair get caught at the bottom end of the brush from time to time, this brush does the job well. Just one problem, after using the brush on my daughter's hair (which is a good amount of hair) the handle came loose; disappointed. Brush is great but not durable so not worth the price i paid for which was about $25.00. So, unless this goes on sale, or you don't have much hair this brush will work for you; otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,Not Sure About this Brush...:/,"I want to like it specially after paying $30 for it. I don't think it's worth this much at all...it should be selling for $20 max! I don't know if it works or not, can't tell it yet. I have long dark thick wave hair. I often dry it straight. This brush hurts a bit and it's kind of unpractical. I have tried like 5 times already but can't seem to learn the right way to use it. My hair gets caught on it a lot and it hurts. I have to use it kind of slow to prevent the tangling. it has not improved the speed of my drying time at all. I can't tell if it make it smooth and shiny, I don't think so. I kind of want to return it as I don't think it works...I'm taking it to my hair stylist next week and see what she thinks."
3,Static Electricity,"A decent brush size, but leaves static charge blah blah dont put constraints if you want reviews i will exit"
5,The best brush,I had to replace a very old brush that was my favorite so I did my research and found this one. Funny thought because once I got the brush I realized it was the same brush I had and I was so happy. There is no better brush than this one for me. Thanks for having it available.
3,Pros and Cons,I found this brush to be great if you are styling someone else's hair and can section all the parts you are blow drying. The bristles are short enough that it won't grab a ton of hair at once and it's easier to clean. The grip is rubber and comfortable but catches hair very easily. I've ripped out my own hair many times. I now won't use it on my own hair and only if I'm styling someone else's hair.
1,Snags hair,"Love the size. I bought it because it claimed to be 100% seamless body and absolutely snag-feel. This is NOT true though-- there is a bottom seam which pulls, traps and breaks my hair! Also the rubber grip will grab and pull hair, too. So I am returning and am still on the hunt for a brush that does not harm my hair."
3,Not good for hair you don't want to rip through.,"I personally use Mason Pearson brushes, but they don't have a round brush. I don't know if I'm just spoiled by the fact that my MP brushes don't pull and tug, but this brush is rough. Very rough. I will continue to look for another round brush that may be a little gentler."
2,Hairtoday,"I bought one of these brushes in every size over a year ago. The brush itself is great. The problem is the rubberized handle grip. I would prefer a brush with a smooth or wood grip, since the grip also rips out your hair when you are using the brush. This happens with regularity. Over time, I think the value of the grip is outweighed by the breakage and damage to the hair."
4,Angel City,I've been looking for this item for years and was really pleased when I found someone who had a copy. I was hoping to find a DVD of this film but had to settle for ordering it on VHS. the film was watchable but because the tracking varies on each recorder it wasn't the best but still happy that I've seen the film again after all this time.
4,sexy shape,"the appearance is nice! just one shortcome that the top is easy to slide dowm, so i use garters to hold it = ="
3,NOT IN STOCK,"I can't believe they are saying ""3 in stock"". I ordered mine a month ago and was just now told:Updated Shipping Estimate: October 28, 2007I do have one that I got from Wal Mart. Take it off if you are wearing light colors it will leave tiny little black spots on your clothing! Otherwise it's easy to install."
3,Doubtful advantage,Consists of a solution (detergent) and a foam applicator. I have just as good results with window cleaner and a soft rag of brush.
2,Marginal Cleaner,"This product only takes off surface dust but presses fine particles in the grooves. I have used it on dozens of LP's and the result is the same. It does nothing but clean the surface dust. It actually does more damage then good. Unfortunately, there is little else out there for the price. Go ahead and waste $20."
3,a gift,Can't give a fair appraisal because I gave it as a gift. Have not got a report from the person who I gave it to.
3,not a great product,"but works o.k.still need more words, who ever did this does not have a real jobone two three"
4,Useful,Useful for it's purpose. Got it on sale. It's definitely not worth the price tag for retail as set by the distributor.
3,what can you say,about a simple product. it does what it is supposed to do and that's about all you can hope for.
2,Not very good...,"I don't feel the velvet on this thing is deep enough to reach very far at all into the grooves. There doesn't seem to be a decent product out there right now. I had to buy a vintage Discwasher on eBay. That baby gets down into the grooves and has the directional fibers that scoop and hold onto any dust. All my records are sounding noticably better after picking that up. The people who gave this thing good reviews are noobs who never used anything that really works and convinced me to throw my money away. This thing probably cost about $1.00 to manufacture, with it's plastic handle and velvet material obviously not designed specifically to clean records."
4,Not Sure Yet,"Haven't had a chance to try it, but looks just like one I had over 20 years ago so should be good."
4,Works Well,"The brush in this kit has two holes in the top which are for pouring the cleaning solution into. The solution is then spread out evenly to dampen the brush. It works well for removing dust and set in stains from dirt. However, the brush is pretty soft and gentle. I don't think it would work too well on records that have a lot of paper stuck in them. The first record I used it on came out shiny and sounded much clearer. Static, clicks and pops were virtually eliminated. The only con I can think of is that you don't get a lot of solution in this kit. The bottle is good for maybe 50-100 records at most. If you plan to do more than that you'll need a refill or replacement."
3,"Not as good as the old Discwasher, but it works alright.","I lost my old 70s-era Discwasher, so bought this device after a bit of research. Works alright, not as well as the old fave. No problems with the purchase, though - good seller."
5,"Very good, cheap brush for quick pre-play cleans","Blows away the modern Discwasher crap being sold today. Does a good job at removing basic dust and specks before playing. Not as sold on the fluid, but use the brush dry 99% of the time as pre-play touch-ups following more thorough cleans. Actually prefer this to carbon fiber brushes, which seem to spread the dust around more instead of actually picking it up, like this A-T brush does. Anyhow, very handy brush to have beside your tables."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"the only reason i give it four stars because i will have to get refill fluid. at this price might as well get the whole new package. i store mine in a sandwich bag which fogs up letting me know i don't need to add hardly anymore more fluid.no use in repeating what everyone else has been saying except i'm surprised how much dust is on what i thought was pretty clean lp! i give an extra pass for the edge of the lp, where all the finger print oil and dust builds up. i should give it a five star rating really. man i'm cheap.ok! i give it five stars*****buy one for a friend."
4,"Works well, good quality",Got a lot of dust off my old LPs. Not quite as nice as my old Discwasher. I went with this one because the reviewson the new Discwasher were not too good. I only wish it came with more fluid-I will run out quickly. I plan to finda recipe for cleaning fluid as all the makers of this stuff are so overpriced-seems like I could make a couple gallons for their price on a few ounces. I've found one recipe so far that is just 50:50 rubbing alcohol and water...any other recipes out there?
4,Good Info,"This was a pretty informative little book which I read a while back. But looking back at what it has to offer, it looks like something I will want to reference in the future. The first half of the book, I would consider a condensed version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The Second half begins with a concise summary of the Vatican II Documents. Following thereafter is a Catholic dictionary. This might be a useful tool for a catechist in the classroom for those ""trivial"" questions one might have to face about little details. It was an ""easy"" read.-Laurence"
2,If you have the Catechism....skip this one,"This book isn't terribly helpful if you already own the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). It doesn't provide any elaboration on common issues (above that provided by the CCC) - and its answers are generally short and uninformative...If you have no other guide books to Catholicism, fine - otherwise skip this one."
4,TIPPING PROBLEM,"THIS IS A GREAT IDEA, BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS MORE STABLE.MAYBE IF THE BOTTON WAS WEIGHTED IT WOULDN'T TIP SO EASY"
5,Nice Kit!,"The cleaning Kit has everything you may need to dust off and clean lenses and filters.Great Price, and a nice compact kit. Only con, another package of lens cleaning paper would be nice.4.8 Stars from Me."
4,Tickle your eardrums,This is a great performance. Julie V's voice will tickle your eardrums. I enjoyed it many years ago on tape. Happy to have it again!
2,Narrator is terrible!,"I love this series and was excited to see it on audio form, but the guy who narrates the book (Cameron Beierle) is ghastly. His male characters all sound pretty much the same and he's made up an accent that at times sounds faintly German and at others faintly British. C'Nedra amazingly enough is either Italian or Spanish and is almost painful to listen to. If he narrates the entire saga, I'm not going to listen to it."
4,"Good sequel, but drags a bit.","While readable, and a good continuation of the Pawn of Prophecy, the second book of the Belgariad series tends to drag a bit.This book is still a darn good book. However, it does tend to be a book where a group of people travels, and that's it. They travel a road, find some enemies and either kill them or outwit them. Three hundred pages of this turns out to be monotonous at times.The story is still overall very captivating. The innocent farm boy, Garion, starts to learn of his powers, his inner being, and his epic mission as he encounters new beings and goes through many different adventures. The description of the jungles of Nyissa alone near the end of the book is worth the price alone.Without giving too much away, this book continues Edding's exciting series and I would highly recommend this book."
4,The best of the series!,"Queen of Sorcery is the Eddings at the top of his game. The one-liners fly left and right, Garion gets into trouble, Aunt Pol stands around looking at everybody with her eyebrows raised, Belgarath is grumpy, Silk is making some witticism or another, Barak is flexing his muscles, Durnik acts like a naive, earnest bumpkin... Well, you know, typical Eddings, but highly readable and the best fun you can have in fantasy."
5,It was great. At every moment you were in suspence.,"I loved the book. It took me 2 days to read the whole book. Once you start, you can't stop. I only wish that all the book in the series , were combined into one. My favorite part was when Garion was in the palace of the snake woman. If you want to read this book go the public libray closest to you. Or by your book by Amazon.com. Remember they take 40 % off the books you you by."
5,Still Going Strong,"Well, David Edding does it again!! His characters become so real to the reader that you feel like slapping Ce'Nedra, you feel like telling Silk that if he pulls any more stunts you're going to turn him into a radish and you feel like giving Garion a big hug and telling him that of course his Aunt Pol still loves him! I just wish David Eddings was as immortal as Belgarath so that he keeps turning out more sagas like the Belgariad and the Mallorean! These books are my talismans and in my opinion every household should have a set."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Orb chase.A knight, an archer, a telepathic horse whisperer, a bratty princess, a couple of grumpy sorcerers, and, of course, the farm boy with super powers.A-questing they will go. For many books to come, it seems.Very light fantasy still."
2,In Which The Killin' Starts,"This is Book the Second in Series the First, in which the young ex-scullery boy Garion discovers that there's Something About Him, though people won't say exactly what that is. Apparently it's not enough for him to be the secret survivor of the Rivan royal line, but he needs a good dose of sorcery as well. He talks to the little voices inside his head as well, which is often preferable to talking to those around him. Back where I come from, setting people on fire is not considered socially acceptable, but apparently in fantasyland it's okay if the bad guy is evil enough.This book is no better or worse than the ones before or after it, regrettably."
4,The Continuing Story of Garion,"The second book of the Belgariad continues the story of Garion as he continues to struggle internally with his new powers that he doesn't want or think he needs. He continues on his journey with Polgara and Belgarath on their quest for the Orb of Aldur, which was stolen by a priest of the evil God Torak. Garion must learn to control his power or it may end up destroying him and others. I'm definitely enjoying this series. The characters in the book are interesting, and the plot believable. The book could easily be read by young adults as well as adults."
2,"Career Knowtes: Mystery Shopping, Seond Edition(How to Have fun and Make Money in a Career You Love Series)","There's not a lot of information in this book. Not worth the money to buy this book. The information written in the book is something you can get online. If you are really wanting to get more valuable information, I recommend the book ""The Mystery Shoppers Manual"" by Cathy Stucker."
1,Not worth the money,"Luckily i only paid 10 dollars for this ""book"" and I feel that i still overpaid. It is a phamplet with mostly clip art throughout the book. They say its 60-70 pages or whatever, but it is not. Read through the whole thing in less than 20 minutes. Didn't help with anything. Do yourself a favor and save your money. You can get the same stuff off of google search."
1,Concierge-Errand Book Better!!!,Mystery shopping is no mystery. A better business to go into is the concierge-errand business!!!
5,Best Mystery Shopping Book I've Read!!!,"No doubt about it, this book got me started immediately in mystery shopping. The leads are all from companies who ACTIVELY hire mystery shoppers!! Also, the sections on starting your own shopping business is invaluable - lots of examples, sample forms, and letters. If the information inside isn't enticing enough, the price is - it's the best money for the price."
4,Housman Is a Great Poet,"I only recently discovered Housman, and am still getting acquainted. But his verse, to me, is so very valuable because it not only is from the heart, it reflects the English spirit of the era."
2,Not as good as the organic soup.,"I love the Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken Noodle Soup. I tried this because the other one wasn't available. I was not very impressed. I ate all 12 cans, so it wasn't horrible. But I definitely like the organic one better."
2,OK Soup....Not Great,This soup is so-so......Not that great. I would not buy it again. It does not have much flavor at all.
2,Not what I expected,BE AWARE!!! The mixes are no longer than 1:30 minutes. These were much to short for what we needed.
4,Outstanding!,"Normally the suspense books are not what I read. I'm so glad I read this book. I couldn't put it down! This book should be read before Sugar & Spice although it was published second. I love how the chapters are short, this gives me time to sneak in reading when I find time! The story grabs you at the beginnning and leaves you begging for more. I can't wait to see the 3rd installment of Mrs. Phoenix Perry! I would rate this book about a 4 1/2 but that option is not there."
4,GOOD BOOK,"It was a page turner for me. It was a different book for me all the martial arts stuff, but I ended up liking it. Worth reading definitely."
1,terrible product,"After several month of minimum use, the XLR connector starts to produce all kinds of connection problem. Don't buy this brand, they must have been using the cheapest material in the connector."
5,spring load nail sets,"6+ years ago I was on job site, (finish Carpenter) & I kept hearing an odd sound coming from were the painters were working. Noticing that they carried no hammer & punch, I curiously asked what they were using. out of the pocket he showed me the springtool nail set, gave a demonstration, and I was sold! haven't picked up a nail punch since.I call it my "" Ba-Dinka"" - that's the sound you hear ""Ba-Dink"", & your nail is set perfectly. Awesome little tool, worth its weight in gold!"
5,Nice snap,Asked for this as a gift. Have used it well so far. I was surprised how nicely it drove a couple of nails right into place; two quick snaps and they were set right where I wanted them so I could fill the spots with Painter's Putty. Now I am eager to do a couple of crown molding jobs I have been putting off.
5,pull off the shelf!,"This was such a great book. Calypso Kelly is one of the few Americans at the posh british boarding school she attends. She has few friends: everyone loves to make fun of her accent. On top of all that, she is one of the few fencers, and she has no experience ""pulling"", or kissing, boys. Calypso takes things into her own hands, pretending that ""gay Jay"", her mom's PA, is her boyfriend in the States. This gives her an in with the most popular girls, and she is getting along quite nicely. She even attracts the attention of Prince Freddie, a royal! When the others discover this, one of the girls goes on the warpath, seeking to destroy Calypso's budding relationship. When she ends up in the tabloids, kissing Prince Freddie, her life gets even more crazy. Will Calypso be able to maintain her new friendships, defeat the evil girl, and win her prince?"
2,Ehh-,"This book wasn't all that. It's certaintly not worth your money. But hey, if your interested in fencing than it's should deffinately read it. But other than that, it's only good for a short read to fill up your time. It's not worth buying though."
2,Not Developed,"This could've been a great book if it had been developed. I became extremely confused because the writer kept jumping from one event to another. The main character, Calypso, is a teenage leper when suddenly she becomes extremely popular and finds out that it just so happens that the head popular girl is actually being mistreated by a fellow popular girl who is the real horrible person who gives the whole group a bad name. Without enough transitional filler to make it understandable, it was just a jumble of nonsense. Another disappointing part is that she falls in the love with, of course, a prince who we never know for sure if he is a jerk or a nice guy. There's too much guesswork that shouldn't be in there.Ultimately, after I finished reading it, I ran around the house screaming ""I want my life back!"""
5,great book,"it's mos def a must-have for any street fighter nut. there's concept art, character profiles, interviews with the creators and artists, all on silky glossy paper. however, it seems kinda rushed, there are SO many typos and errors and crap, but it isn't really that big a dealrecommended"
5,An amazing collection!,"If you have any interest in the artwork of Street Fighter, game character design, or game design artbooks, I think you will love this book. The artwork is amazing! I have been drawing and collecting Street Fighter artwork since I first played the game as a kid in the 90's. I have since stopped playing video and computer games completely, but I never completely stopped drawing these characters. This book was well worth the $18 I paid for it and I especially recommend it to artists (of any level) with an interest for game character design."

5,BRATZ ROCK!!!,... bratz are a hundred times better then my scene! my scene was a total copy of bratz! bratz are very pretty and very durable!
5,Not breakable!,this toy is cool. some people think her skirt is really firly and it is but thats her style.Punk is her style too and i think thats totally cool!this toy does not break easily. some people say it does but the kids that play with it are being TOO rough. thats why they put 4 and up. not 1 and up.you have to be very careful with it.its an awsome toy to give to a child.
5,One of My Favorite Books,"I got this book back in 1995 when it was first published, I can't imagine it was that long ago because the book is still in such great condition. Not that I don't use it, on the contrary, I use it at least once a week. The pictures are lovely but the recipes are the real gems. Philip B. was the first to introduce me to the thought of using flavor extracts, which really do work nicely. Some of the ingredients are not what you would find in your cupboard but they are not so exotic you need a round trip ticket to Bali. Everything can be found in your super market or right here on the net. I highly recommend it!"
1,Okay if planning to use them on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner,"The lights are terribly unreliable. I initially purchased 5, 2 of which were dead on arrival. Of the next 2, both worked. After a year, 2 of the remaining 5 stop working (stayed on all the time). So, of my 7 units, 3 are still functioning after one year (>50% failure rate). Of those 3, 2 work as they should, and the third works most of the time but occasionally goes into a mode where it quickly cycles on and off.At least none caught on fire, so they're probably okay if you're planning on putting them in a Boeing airliner, but the average homeowner will probably want to avoid these."
2,Motion light worked for a short time only - 1 month,"I ordered 3 of these units, 2 of which were installed. One was working great for about 3 weeks, and now it turns on sometimes, and not at other times. I can walk up to it in the middle of the night and wave my hand over the motion sensor and it will not turn the lights on. Then recently, on few occasions, it turns on, but one has to be a few feet away, even though it is set to high sensitivity. The other installed unit appears to have a broken sensitivity button. It is too sensitive and turns on repeatedly without noticeable motion changes. Cheap price, but not worth it if it does not work. Going to install the 3rd unit I purchased to replace one of the installed two units. Hope it works..."
2,"Very intermittant, therefore, is very frustrating.","Operates quite well for a while, then stops working (with lights off) for a while. Some days it won't turn on first thing, then intermittant the rest of the day. Very annoying when depending on the lights, cannot force them on so as to see. If it would not go dead at times, the device would be perfect! Sensor works as advertised-when it is working.Service by the seller was outstanding, cannot fault them for the problem with the product.A week later....I just threw it away and ordered a different fixture ...Couldn't take the intermitant behavior any longer. Too cheap to justify a return, maybe that was the plan, you think!"
4,Works most of the time.,Works most of the time. Sometimes it stays on and you have to flip the light switch to get it to reset. For the money it works well. Will update in the coming months if this thing stops working.
4,No hassle lighting,Quality is as good or better than anything I can find locally at a price that beasts even discount stores. Simple to install then forget it and let it do it's thing. Light when you need it.
4,"Works great, cheap plastic","Product was an easy install. We previously had metal ones without motion. I gave it a 4-star due to the plastic which I believe may not last, but time will tell. The motion lights come on quickly due to using PAR30 LED lights. Previously, we had florescent PAR30 bulbs. We did not need lights on all the time. Be advised, that the lights can be tripped on by wind when plants, bushes, and trees move.UPDATE: After 3 years of use, plastic has held up well. I have had 1 motion sensor fail out of the 2 lights. Been using PAR30 LEDs without issue."
4,"Temperamental, but they eventually worked.","I originally gave this product a bad review after all five that I had would stay on all night occasionally, sometimes just one, sometimes a few, sometimes all of them. It drove me nuts and I was about to remove all of them. But, I did find the problem. These things ship with the sensitivity set to max and I never changed that. After changing them to mid scale, they appear to work as I'd expect. For the price, these are a good value."
1,Waste of my time.,"Let me start by saying I installed three of these lights on my house over fifteen years ago and two of them are still working fine. The third one went bad recently and I ordered a new one from Amazon. Installed it in the exact same spot on the eve of the house, same wiring, etc. As soon as dusk came, the light came on and stayed on about five minutes. Went off. Came back on in a minute or two. Went off after the five minutes. Came on again. It does this over and over for no reason I can see. There's nothing to cause it to come on. I tried all the settings and adjustments available. Same results. Sent it back and Amazon quickly sent me a another one. The next one would stay off a bit longer but would eventually come on, again for no reason. I sure was pleased with the first three and the service I got from them. Tells me these are not of the same quality as they were years ago. No more Heath Zeniths for me."
3,50/50 for me,"Had one that motion did not work right off the bat, but the other one worked ok. Very cheaply made and you can find them cheaper at a local store, much easier to return."
2,Sensor timer is worthless,"The sensor timer switch and manual mode do not work. I have the sensor time set at 10 min and the light always turns off after 1 min. I didnt realize it until the fixture was already installed and it just was not worth the effort to take it down. The light also features a manual mode; turn the light on for 1 second, off and back on and the light should be manual until daylight. That simply doesnt work. I wouldnt buy again."
4,Great price,Won't know if it's REALLY GOOD until I find out how long it will LAST. Most of them sense it's DARK in daylight.
4,Wokrs ok,"Works good considering the price. Depending on how you mount the light, remember to position the sensor right side up correctly.If not, water will leak inside and short out the electronic. I learned the hard way. 1st light stop working in the 1st few days.For the cheap price, I just bought a replacement."
4,works well,Product works well. It was easy to install. Uses standard bulbs. Good range of coverage.I would recommend this product to others.Dan
3,Cheap build,They work but just barely-we replaced one exactly like this-switch got condensation in it. Their is a rubber seal however-use it.
4,Works as expected in most cases,"It gets 4 stars because I found it turns on the light during raining nights which is not what I expected.Otherwise, it works as expected."
4,Light,"Easy to install. Kind of cheap plastic opposed to the metal one it was replacing, but I knew it would be for the price. Works well and happy with it."
1,A sad departure,"I am a great lover of A. J.'s music from his first three albums. I think he is a superb Blues artist and lyricist. However, never having been much of a Beatles fan I find this album incredibly dull. Moving into such a crowded area as Beatles tribute seems to be a waste of a real talent."
4,Product Condition,I very much enjoy Reeve's writing. I had already read this book. The book I ordered is for a friend. The paperback that arrived has a puckered spine. I did not return it because it is too difficult to get to the Post Office to do so.MAE
5,A must read for caregivers or those with aging parents,Reeve surely has Ann's gene for writing. This book should be read by all who still have parents alive and will be faced with their eventual death and by those who have already lost a loved one. Alzheimers and dimentia are a death before dying. It is hardest on those left behind and gilt and worry are only some of the emotions one has to deal with during the dying process. Reeve caught the essence of her mother and was fortunate to be able to have 24/7 caregivers to help her through this ordeal.This book is a tribute to Ann and to Reeve's Sister.
4,no more words,"Reeve Lindbergh does a marvelous job depicting the last days of her mother, Anne Morrow Lindbergh. It's a touching account."
5,Her mother's daughter...,"I led the discussion on GIFT FROM THE SEA at our book club this fall and became engrossed in the diaries of Anne Morrow Lindbergh. What a pleasant experience to discover and read NO MORE WORDS by Reeve Lindbergh. She writes with the same sensitivity and personal insight as her mother. Reeve's relationship with her mother during the final days of Anne's life, reveals the frustrations and the joys of a family caregiver. Her book is a ""gift"" to all who are or may find themselves in a similar situation."
1,Death Trap,"I made the wrong decision when I bought this bag. This bag is not rigid enough to be placed on the side of the bike. Nearly caused me my life because it caught on the spokes of my bike and I fell while a car was approaching behind me. I thank all the gods that the car was slow. To top it all, Niagara Cycle blames me for putting it on my bike. The construction of this bag is so bad that Sunlite only thought about the cosmetic value of the bag and not the safety of the rider. They thought that just because there is a cardboard on the sides of the bag it will be good on a bike. What a waste. Please buy another bag. Save yourselves"
1,Avoid. They fall off!,"These are great in principle. They're roomy and easy to use. But, they fall off! Just ask my laptop that went flying down the street. On the other hand, the Targus slip case that it was in inside the panier protected it beautifully!"
4,Nice for the Money,"I am like everyone else. I like the bags but the mounting is not great. I will probably figure out something on the mounting to use velcro to keep the bags on the rack. Overall a great bag for $27.00. I would not use them to go around the world but for a nice day ride or even 4 days they should be fine with a little fiddling on the mounting. As for them falling off, I can't see that. There are 4 top straps that hook to the top of my blackburn rack that keep it in place. The problem is with the sides of the bags."
3,Great for Occasional Use,"These bags fit great on my bike rack and were very easy to figure out. However, they are not stiff enough to sustain holding a U-lock inside, as the weight of the lock kept knocking the bags into my spokes. So I tried putting my lock on my rack under the bag. This works well, but now the straps on the bag are too short to be easily connected to the rack.The bags themselves are very lightweight and I have never had an issue with them falling off or even becoming loose. They are big enough to hold a winter jacket, but are also useful for holding small objects like keys. All in all, these bags are great for occasional use, but are too much of a hassle to use everyday without modification of the straps."
5,great gift!,"we sold the car almost a year ago, and bought baskets for the bikes, but my wife still needed a place for her library books, raingear, etc. some place inconspicuous and weather proof. this provides both. and with a little ingenuity. it has stayed in place, not fallen off like i feared from earlier reviews. a great buy!"
2,Just fine,This book is not bad as it is not about teaching how to play but is about poker anecdotes. Would recommend it.
2,ONLY for the beginner,"If you're an intermediate player, this book really has nothing to offer you. The writing is ok, but there's very little drama and very little theory. Maybe Phil Gordon, whom I respect as a poker player, will write a substantial book on his trade in the future, but this isn't that book. Don't waste your money if you already know how to calculate pot odds."
4,Great Beginners' read,Basic concepts are well-explained and the book introduces you nicely into the world of poker
5,"The ""Real Deal"" is a real good book","So I've never written a review for a book before, butI felt like this one was worth my time. I guess thisis really a thanks to the authors for pulling back thecurtain on what it takes to go to the next level ofplaying poker for someone like me. I've been playing ahome game for a while but always felt intimidated toplay in the casinos or live tournaments. This book hadenough strategy, tips and stories to be anentertaining and informative read for someone withpoker experience, but I think it would also be reallyhelpful for a beginner or someone accustomed to thehome game who's feeling the pull of the bigger poker world."
4,Good information,"I seemed to find all the cities and places I'm looking for. I'm still slowly working on my astrology. So far, it's accurate and I'm happy."
4,A Strong Western Historical Romance!!,"This was a strong western historical romance which takes the reader from Virginia to Wyoming and the wild land that eventually becomes the home and heart of Jordan McGuire once again. This time she comes back to claim her birthright, but along the way she finds herself taken by Gray Hawk and brought back to his tribe to live with them. What starts out as a fate worse then death changes as Jordan grows and learns things about herself. Gray Hawk soon becomes the captor of her heart, but will she stay with him when he gives her a chance to go back to her original life?This was a very emotional book, and the story was well told. Western historicals seem to be making a comeback and this story is a perfect addition to the genre. This is the first time I've ever read anything by Ms. Templeton and I look forward to reading stories by her in the future.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
3,Disappointed,"I love all types of books - western, contemporary, series. I thought the author tried to get too many things into one book - family issues, ethical issues, violence, etc.The story was good, but the way the author took us to get to the ending was very disappointing."
3,good light,Bought this because of the green LEDs for hunting. They work great but the white buld doesn't hold up very well.
4,Kept my feet warm,"I needed a solution for my frozen feet while skiing in Quebec, Canada! I found a wonderful product for my atomic ski boots: therm-ic battery pack. It's been amazing, I've enjoyed m'y ski days this cold winter!"
1,Compendium of outdated ideas presented as a sequence of trivial exercises in an irrelevant format,Surely there's a team of bright junior high students out there who can give us something more worthwhile than this? Come on. . .
3,"Only 5 flavors, not 10","The sour jelly bellies are tasty; however, this item contains the 5-flavor mix. The description for 10 flavors is inaccurate and misleading. Amazon.com, please fix this!!! Either change the description or provide the 10-flavor mix."
1,Not as described,"This is a 5 flavor assortment, not the 10 flavor assortment. If your looking for the 10 flavor assortment as I was, DO NOT ORDER THIS!!! False advertising..."
5,well made,"so, i was a bit skeptical. my wife and i have been guides for years and have used leatherman and gerber exclusively. i bought her this one as an experiment. she loves it and i love it. going to get myself one also. like the curved handle(a bit odd at first, but now enjoy it), the blades/tools, and all the accessories. most of all, i like the durability. had it for two months and have put it to good, heavy use. seems to do very well and blades keep a good edge and sharpen easily. if you 're thinking about getting one. do so."
4,A cool addition to the swisstool family.,"What's good:1) The needlenose pliers in spirit is more useful if you need need to grip smaller items.2) Smaller size, easier to carry.3) Inner tools can be opened when the pliers is closed.4) Even better fit and finish in general. Eg locking buttoms, individual springs and that unique blade...etc.What's bad:1) Why use the dead pins to connect the whole tool? You can't fix it, you can't change the inner tools.... They should use screws instead.2) May not 100% stainless steel, note that the file or some parts maybe casehardened steel.3) No ruler.4) Unlike some people, i don't like the curved handles of the spirit, sure they make the pliers action perform better, but if you want to use the outside tools, it performs poorer...5) The new scissors design is bad, the spring is still under tension when closed and it's mouth is so short!6) That stupid and poorly-designed hook. I only need a simple reamer..."
4,Backpackers look elsewhere..,"This is a high quality tool. The fit, finish and action are very impressive. It would be perfect for the handyman, tradesman or anyone that doesn't care about bulk or weight. I especially like the locking feature for the tools. Because it's such a nice tool, I plan on keeping it. It will likely last for many years with minimal care. Having said that, it's probably not for the backpackers out there. The pictures don't capture how large and heavy this tool is relative to many other multi-tools and most swiss army knives. So if you're a backpacker who watches every ounce, there are better alternatives."
3,Good product but seems a little expensive for what it is.,"This is a nice tool, but I was not terribly impressed with its value. For the price, I expected the item to feel more precise. The edges of the side walls should be more radiused to better fit the hand Not a negative review, but I expected something a little more ergonomic."
4,Awesome Multi-Tool,"This is a great multi tool, I don't use it much but has all the functions you need in a multi-tool. Hope I get as much life out of it as my Leatherman. The blades on this are very sharp. Amazingly sharp. Fast shipment. I would recommend this to others."
5,$55 is great value and makes a great gift to any guy,I already owned a Victorinox SwissTool X and a Spirit. Its size makes it a convenient multi-tool to be carried around anywhere. I waited a few months before Amazon finally dropped its price from $80+. I bought two more Spirit - one for my brother and another for my uncle who just love neat tools. Why? All stainless steel and Swiss made. I just prefer something that is NOT made in China or made in the U.S. but with parts from China.
4,Great and very useful,"Comes in very handy, nice carrying pouch and is high quality. I would spend the extra money for the RS that has more tools if you plan on using this a lot."
5,19th Century Humor is STILL funny,"This was a fun book. I enjoyed experiencing a haunting from the ghost's perspective. The inventive personas/costumes that the ghost employed & juicy scary tidbits related to each one were highly entertaining. Was Oscar Wilde making a social commentary on annoying Americans with no imagination? Possibly, but still a great read."
4,"Enjoyable, quick read",I purchased this for my grandaughters and found it more appropriate for teens/adults. I enjoyed reading it. I purchased the movie version for the younger family members.
3,"Amusing, though not his best work.","Oscar Wilde, <strong>The Canterville Ghost</strong> (Public Domain Books, 1906)Oscar Wilde's supernaturally comedic classic has been made into any number of movies (and despite this, I have somehow only seen a low-budget Polish version that was made for television, but which is quite enjoyable), so I've heard about it roughly ten thousand times, but I had never actually gotten round to reading it until now. It's not as spiked with quotable lines as <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> or <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em>, but it's still snappy and fun, until it's ruined by a characteristically moral ending (tacked on, one assumes, in order to make the book palatable to Victorian audiences). Useless ending aside, however, it's still fun, and worth reading; a short introduction to Wilde that gives you a good feel for his writing. ***"
4,The Canterville Ghost,"The Canterville Ghost is a small book, which is quite easy to read. The difficult words have a translation in German.It is a funny story and there are a lot of jokes. Sometimes it is a little bit boring., but when you like the spiritual then you like this book.It is a fantasy history, who you can have your own imagination. It is a sad history, but there is a happy ending.There you see the different between the serious spiritual English people and the practical American people.You can see the similarity between the story and the writer. Oskar Wilde has had a very difficult live, and in his story is the ghost a thing, which have a bad live.I think it is a good book for read at school, because it is a good English. And I have loved the jokes very much and I like the mystical and spiritual in this book."
2,Not scary and too short.,"""The Canterville Ghost"" is too short of a story. It refreshing to have a ghost be merciful, and Oscar Wilde gave a nice, dry humorous spin on hauntings, but the story is very weak. I would have liked more to be written about Sir Simon and Virginia's adventure into Death, and the ending was too abrupt and out of place. I ""sorta"" recommend."
5,Great short read!,Bought this for a book club selection. Very engaging and worth the few hours it took to read it. Would highly recommend it.
1,Very Disappointing,"A best a very disappointing book of patterns. At best almost all of the patterns are extremely basic and almost cartoonist in concept. If you are a very beginning scroller you may find the book interesting... but if you have completed even the most basic patterns previously you will not be happy with the content.The only saving grace was the butterfly patterns.. again simple but with enough detail that a beginner will feel slightly challenged, but not an experiance scroller."
5,Excellent!,The Masterplan as a B Side? This just shows the quality of Oasis. Go and buy this record now and you will hear for yourself just how good it is.
4,British view of the American Revolution,"This is a compilation of letters, diary entries, and accounts from various participants and witnesses, to the principle events, on the battlefield anyway, of the American Revolutionary War. Editor Wright interposes commentary linking the various quotes, and is generally judicious and even-handed. The quotes are mostly a paragraph or two, and occasionally just a sentence, and they are sorted by year. The edition of this book I got was from the Folio Society, a British book club that does premium editions of books, and they include color illustrations that often don't accompany other editions. Given that, this is a worthwhile addition to any library on the American Revolution, though serious historians would find it a bit superficial, I think."
5,The best heater!!!!,"Ever huddled next to a heater that decides when you're warm enough and turns itself off? I hate those! :) I experimented with different heaters through my company and finally, my office manager ordered me this one. When you move or tilt it, it wll shut itself off to prevent accidental fires but otherwise, it stays on without ANY issues! At work, I have it on for the entire 8 hour days I am there (minus breaks) and at home, I have it on until I go to bed. I do get worried about going to sleep with this heater next to my bed and thus, wont use it in the bedroom since mine is quite small. I guess if you have a lot of room and no children, you could put it in the middle of the room and away from anything flamable. In all other respects, it's absolutely the best. I loved it so much, I bought it for home. I get really cold in the winter and this heater really helps me get through those cold NY seasons. You will not regret this purchase."
1,Shoddy product,"Heater will turn itself off after 10 minutes or so on high, due to its ""automatic overheat protection"". Pretty darn shoddy design for it to overheat from normal operation after 10 minutes considering it's a HEATER. After its automatic overheat protection kicks in, its controls will be disabled, and according to the manual, it is necessary to unplug the heater in order to reset it before it can be used again. Its high setting is useless unless you're willing to babysit it."
