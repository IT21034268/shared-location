5,Get it now!!!,"I am 100% satisfied with this set. A ""greatist hits"" if you will of some of the best known jazz artists. The songs are just as the title says....smooth. Only two vocals on the entire set, so if you like the easy instrumental jazz, go to your music store and grab this set."
2,Overpriced And Dry,"In a word, this is boring. It is definitely written like far too many textbooks - dry and not particularly user friendly.It is also - like most textbooks - very overpriced. The value is highly questionable.My advice is that if you must have this for a class - buy it used. At least you won't bet robbed quite so badly.That being said, the author does a reasonably good job of reviewing various ethical theories. If you need a good sleeping aid, this may be the ticket."
2,so boring,"My professor is actually the author of this book so not only do I have to read this impossibly boring book, but I also get the lectures too. The book is incredibly wordly and phrases things in more complex ways than need be. I read about a page and need to take a break and often times I'll read the page and have no idea what I read because it's so boring. So, unless you need it for class, I don't recommend this as a joy-read."
4,Metal Slug Madness,"The Metal Slug series on the Neo Geo is one of the most hyper and intense action games around. All-out bloody warfare and guns a' blazing, this Neo Geo legend has been ported perfectly for the Game Boy Advance. The game runs quick and smooth. The graphics retain that classic 'Metal Slug' look. An improvement over the Neo Geo versions is the introduction of a lifebar rather than the ol' one-hit wonder. Only bad thing is that the prices on the used circuit is way overboard. Otherwise, this is an awesome game."

5,Climb to the top,"This is it. The only Mountain album you ever need to own if you only want one. Forget about the over played ""Mississippi Queen"". Take a ride on the Sleigh and you'll never want to get off. Felix who helped produce Cream, here with master guitarist Leslie West are at their best. It's a shame Felix was killed by his wife they may have had another masterpiece in there somewhere. Buy it........"
5,This Is More Like It,"I trashed the sound quality of the new reissue of Mountain's ""Climbing"" and improperly lumped ""Nantucket Sleighride"" in with it. But there really isn't much tape hiss on this one, and the sound quality is MUCH improved over the original issue. Needless to say, this is a classic album, and well worth getting for its enhanced sound. But hang to your old ""Climbing"" cd -- the new one isn't any better. I guess I should assume that the original master of ""Climbing"" is basically unsalvageable and give the Sony folks a break on that one. Maybe."
2,slight but professional,"Really 2 1/2 stars--maybe three.This wasn't much when it was released, and it hasn't withstood the ravages of time particularly well. Still, it is professionally put together. The musicans are competent--in tune and in time. Yes, the lyrics are mediocre, but only occasionally embarrassing (""The Animal Trainer and the Toad"" and ""My Lady""). I like the record's crunchy sound, and the guitar lick (with overdubs apparently) that alternates with the sailor whistle tune in its title song.By the way, this is NOT ""heavy metal"". For one thing, the term hadn't been invented yet. For other things, there are no devil-worship or monster-movie lyrics; there is no incessant repetition of an...riff as in Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man""; and there is nothing over-the-top or excessive or unpleasant about the record all. It is an unassuming, simple, straightforward product of its time. There is some hard rock, and there are some gentler pieces."
5,a classic,I first came across Mountain in my early twenties (yes I am 70's rock fun) and I was blown away by it. Those days vinyl ruled and this was an album that I always wanted to eventually have on CD for prosperity because they do not make music like this anymore.
2,"Right Song , Wrong Album","This album has only the short studio version of Nantucket Sleighride . I had forgotten the much longer , & much better cut of this & other songs are on "" Theme for an Imaginary Western . So for that reason it is "" for me "" a very disappointing album . thus my 2 stars for a 5 star song ! Mountain suprised me in concert & easily ranks among the top 5 or 10 concerts I have ever seen . A very under rated band."
2,Not bad but not great,"I don't think Mountain's studio work ever approached their live performances. This just sounds thin, with the high point being Pappalardi's vocals in the title track. Leslie West plays much better on Leslie West Live. His guitar is the real star of this show, and his vocals get better all the time. This album doesn't capture the overwhelming sound the big guy generated. It seems like he was trying to be just another member of the band, and that's a waste. For a great kick, check out his acoustic versions of The Animals and Bob Dylan on You Tube. Mountain was just his warm-up act. He's better not than he was then."
5,This stuff's good!,"I had this ablum when it first arrived. Highlights are many; Tired Angels tells the tale of enablers everywhere, The Great Train Roberry has some of the best slide guitar around, Nantucket Sleighride is great for animal rights activists. Tell your girlfriend ""I can feel your heartbeat through a cement wall"" from this album. You have got to get this if you like old basic rock!"
4,Leslie and Felix,"I bought CLIMBING when it was first released. The LP revealed some of the greatest electric guitar I had ever heard. With the release of NANTUCKET SLEIGHRIDE, I became a bigger fan of MOUNTAIN. DON'T LOOK AROUND is a rock masterpiece followed by another masterpiece, TAUNTA/NANTUCKET SLEIGHRIDE. Leslie and Felix are in excellent form and the songs are well written and well crafted. This is my favorite MOUNTAIN release. I had the pleasure of seeing THE LESLIE WEST BAND in 1976 at The Blue Onion Club in Norman, Oklahoma. There will never be another band like MOUNTAIN. I also recommend FLOWERS OF EVIL with the live side that will rock you to the bone."
4,mountain on top,"I always liked this album, maybe one of their best.Mountain was a great line up of musicians with Leslie West topping the bill. Felix Poppalardis' production abilities made this group par with any of the groups of the day and he was a great bass player. The music still stands the test of time it's too bad all you ever hear on the radio is Mississippi Queen. Mountain had more to offer and this album proves it, with keyboards and good solid drumming of Corky Lang gave this groop more versatility than just a guitar band could offer. It has a nice variety of ballads, hard rockin tunes and rolling rhythems. Just buy it."
3,"Radical, not logical","Luce Irigaray brings up very strong and valid points for the equality of opportunity of women in the workforce, but many of her statements seem to be of an idealistic nature. It places the responsibility on the employer to accommodate the personal desires of the employee. It also seems to remove the personal responsibility from the female employee in regards to working toward more satisfying employment. The generalized statements the author makes about women place limitations on the kind of employment she thinks would be appropriate, that the women would enjoy, and that the women would be good at. It seems as though Irigaray is saying that keeping women off of the corporate ladder is okay and completely acceptable because a women would not be good at, nor would she enjoy that kind of work."
1,How long did THIS take to write?,"I just bought this book and I am very disappointed. This is not nearly as good as the SFC1 strategy guide and has no mission walk throughs. I understand this was written in a week, and it shows. I have also found errors in the appendix, and I can't recommend this guide to anyone."
5,Beautiful music!!,"Beautiful music and a pleasureto listen to. Gave this CD asa gift and the couple we gaveit to, love it."
5,Excellent For The Professional or The Layman,"Being a psychyology major in college specializing in addiction, as well as overcoming my own personal addictions, I found Twerski's book was excellent. I bought it simply as a text book supplement for a college course, and ended up reading it a few times. He gives a great insight into the mind of the addict, and nice overview of life AFTER addiction and the logical, spiritual, and emotional hurdles forever in front of the affected individual and those around him. I read this just after my third year of abstinence and pulled so much from it in my personal life. Whether you are an addict or just know or have been affected by one, have been through the twelve-step meetings or struggled alone, give it a try. It still sits in my library and is a book I often recommend to those I meet and are dealing with an aspect of addiciton, treatment, and sobriety."
4,A guide to understanding how the addict thinks,"Finally, in plain English, this book explains how the addict thinks and why he treats himself and others the way he does. It doesn't solve the problem, but it does offer comfort in knowing that you are not to blame. I only wish the book went one step farther in offering some advice as to how to deal sanely with addictive behavior, how to react and perhaps what to expect when you do react. Overall, well worth reading."
4,A good book - but Rabbi Twerski has a better one,"A very good book with the basics on addiction. I especially enjoyed the chapter on spirituality and the addict, although I would have liked to have seen a little more on this subject.Twerski's book ""The Spiritual Self"" has what I was looking for and much more. I think it is a must read for ANYONE on the road to recovery. He explains how the role of the human spirit is essential in the addict's new life and how one does not even need to be religious (although it certainly helps!)."
4,Addictive Thinking,Hello - this is actually a second hand review. I purchased this copy to give to parents of a twentys son who is struggling with addiction. They have said that it has answered a lot of questions for them. They are really pleased with the book. The mother said that it was almost as though the writer had overheard conversations with her son.
3,Educational..supportive.,The book was great reading. I felt a bit more educated to understand the problem but not really a sense of direction of what to do..
5,A Must-Have,I have been using this book for years. Worked directly in addiction in rehab for women with children for ten years. Work with adolescents now. Twerski has nailed it--the nature of addictive thinking and how this self deception effects the addicts reltionship to self and everyone around her. It has helped me tremendously in my work.
2,Wrong set was sent,"Apparently there are three sets with the same cover. I ordered this one, hoping to get a Betty Boop DVD with ""Minnie the Moocher,"" ""Snow White"" and some other pre-code classics. Unfortunately, only one of the sets with this front cover contains those episodes, and I was sent one of the other two by mistake. I was very disappointed when I looked on the back and found that the set contained only those toned-down post-code episodes you can get absolutely anywhere, with Henry, Grampy, Pudgy, etc. Don't order this set. There are other ones you can buy, and be certain that you're getting the correct episodes."
2,Buyer beware,"Amazon does it again. This is NOT the Platinum Disc version it is the Echo Bridge version. This was mentioned in another review (see Very Very Disappointed, November 28, 2007) and Amazon has still not corrected it. When I called Amazon they referred me to the seller who did offer to take it back but I'll be out shipping both ways and it's just not worth it."
2,Betty Boop,"The reason I bought this product was for the episodes, ""Minnie the Moocher"" and ""Snow White"". I saw these listed on the page of the item being sold somewhere and thus made the purchase. I've received it and read on the back to find a completely different list of episodes."
2,Post-2007 update,"In 2007 Echo Bridge issued new sets with the same covers, but reversed as to content and mixed around the contents as well. As a result, if you are seeking specific cartoons, you cannot go by the well-meaning guide of earlier reviewers. You are ALMOST CERTAIN to be disappointed. I counsel avoidance of these Echo Bridge products unless, somehow, you are new to Fleischer animations and just seeking an introduction."
2,Missing cartoon,"I wanted Snow White in particular, but the product doesn't have it. The list given in another review is different from what is included here.If Amazon would list the cartoons included, it would help customers to find what they want."
5,"Stories, philosophy and history of Kuan Yin.","This is perhaps my favorite book by John Blofeld. The stories of Kuan Yin are well told, diverse and moving. He strikes an excellent balance between philosophy, history, story telling, Kuan Yin meditation techniques, and personal devotion.There are a few pages of b/w photos, of Kuan Yin, Tara and Avalokiteshvara, the pictures vary in quality. However, many of them I have never seen before and a few definitely inspire devotion.The fact that John Blofeld lived and traveled in China, his joyous devotion to Kuan Yin, and his knowledge of the Chinese language and culture adds immensely to the book and puts it in a class by itself."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"I bought this item and it is not as pictured, it has a Lobster clasp not the hidden clasp as shown. I contacted them and they have not changed the Image in there ad. Also I was told I would recieve a shipping label to return it and here it is 04/24/06 and I still have not recieved anything from the store!"
4,A solid razor for a great value,I am going to admit- I am not a big fan of shaving my legs. It just seems like a big rigmarole to me. This isn't to say I don't do it...but it isn't something I like to do. Does any woman?I was using the INTUITION razors- you know the one with the big soap donut around the razor itself- but I found that to be awkward- especially when it was full. Then I always seemed to run out of the soap on one side and it would fall off and gunk up my shower. So on a whim I tried out this one. The first reason I picked this one? It was pink. The second? I had heard of Schick and decided to give it a go.I was impressed with the quality of the razor itself. Its heavy (but not too heavy) and the blades seemed nice and sharp yet not dangerously so. A single blade lasts a really long time- yet another thing to love about this razor. The only downfall are that the refills are a bit pricey to me.
1,surprisingly unimpressive,"As a long-time Carol enthusiast, I was hoping for a much more interesting and enlightening book. Very little of Carol's wit and sensitivity shows up on these pages. It was a disappointment."
5,Fresh Twist On An Immortal Theme.,"Tired of romances written with a formula? Well, here's a fresh approach. Heros to ""die"" for, heroines to cheer on, and villains to laugh over...well, to each her own! Fallen Angels, Rafe's Heart takes a new look at vampires and other asorted immortals. No whining or endless complaining from these guys (and girls), just this reader's curiosity of what they'll do next! I can't wait to see what the evil Katherine has up her sleeve..."
4,My 4 year old loves it,My son got this toy for his 4th birthday and is still a big fan one year later. He does not use the rubber band that is supposed to propel the toy in the water (it is too hard for him)but he loves to push him around and use his imagination. It has been a great toy in the bathtub as well as at the pool. The figure stays upright very easily unlike some other water toys we have.
5,A must for world music listeners!,"This CD is really amazing. With voice and percussion only Ali and Ellis make a music of the world, for the world. I highly recommend this CD to play over and over. Unfortunately, their second release 'Offerings' is less inspired that this one."
3,Decent Kitchenette Music,"I like all instruments played and her educated voice, nevertheless it lags far behind AboneCroneDrone by Sheila Chandra and any traditional piece of art. I could not use it for meditation as it remains steadily on the surface without highs and lows, too easy-going & americanized. It doesn't bother or elevate, probably good and deep enough for New Age cooking."
4,better than people think!,"This is a very underrated ministry disc. I don't understand the subpar reviews for a c.d. with Supermanic soul, Bad Blood, and Step. It's not Psalm 69 or The land of Rape and Honey, but its superior to Filth Pig."
1,All Good Things...,"I was really looking forward to this album. Really. I didn't think Ministry could/would make another Filth Pig, yet they manage to make it sound _worse_. The only song worth mentioning is Supermanic Soul; all the other songs are pathetically slow, boring, and oh-so lame. Ministry is DEAD."
2,time to pack it in...,"Well what can I say about Ministry, from the sheer brilliance of The Land of Rape and Honey to The Mind is a Terrible Thing..they have severely slumped to churning out run of the mill industrial metal, power cords galore and shoddy sample work meld together to give a weak thoughtless sound. Who are they trying to fool, its all about making easy bucks the only way they know how I feel...look for something fresh instead."
5,The Ministry is coming back to us,"This album is great. After filth pig, I thought 43 year old Al Jourgenson was going down hill. This album proved me wrong! On song #2 (whip and chain), he has Puff daddy laying out some words. Its great! They even re-did a Lover Boy song, it is kicking!! BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,Ya know something? I actually kinda enjoyed this disc!!,"I guess i'm something of a ministry freak 'cause i've liked every album they've put out ('cept for the early techno-pop stuff-although ""every day is like halloween"" is pretty smooth) and DSOTS is no exception. It's not the best album ever but it is an excellent addition to my Ministry collection. The thing that impresses me the most about Ministry is that each new album presents a slightly different flavor of music. It seems to me that most of the people that gave this disc a bad review are still living in the past (here's a hint-change is good)."
3,At least it ain't Filth Pig!,"I liked ""Bad Blood"" when it came out on the Matrix soundtrack, but apart from that track and one other, it's nothing new. It reminds me of a mix between ""Rape"" and ""Mind"", but better produced. But, if I wanted those CD's, I'd just pop them into my player."
2,"""When rock groups get too old"" or ""Pass the prune juice""","Having been introduced to Ministry in my college years I grew found of their loud unusually style. The mixture of samples, 3 chord riffs at volume 11 and lyrics reaching into a culture I secretly admired. Fast forward 5 years and I see a band who at one time held a ranking of pioneers in the ""industrial"" music scene, putting out music to pay the electric bills. Some titles, ""Step"" show flashes of Al's unique style and personality but too many songs are just stale. The album relies are dark monotonous rhythms which sound outdated most noticeable on Vex & Siolence. Ministry needs some new life and stop reliving older tunes."
2,"My god , this is horrible","simply .. Ministry was a big name in industrial .. what happened ? this stuff is undanceable , unlistenable waste .. and that hurts cuz i love ministry"
4,Better than you'd think,"This album is similar to Filth Pig in that it's largely underrated...And similarly, it's overall a heavy album that doesn't have very many fast songs...I think Filth Pig is their best album...In short, anyone who really likes Filth Pig should find 5-7 (or more) very good songs on here...Those who oppose Filth Pig should spend their closed-minded money on something else..."
1,Ministry is dead,I was hoping for a ministry album that would make up for the dissapointment of filth pig but what i get is another kick in the balls with yet another ministry album that instead of proving how great the band once was and could be again has shown me they've lost it.... completely... it's sad
1,I don't like it!,"Who'd know that the band that in the 80's released wickedly charming synthpop jam With Sympathy and awesome dark electro-clad Twitch a decade later will churn out such crap as Filthpig or The Dark Side of the Spoon? Psalm69, Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste and The Land of Rape and Honey were THEE albums of my teens. Filthpig sucked, so does this CD. If you're looking for the fast paced industrial metal get mid-period Ministry CDs because they are the best this genre has to offer. If you however love the 80's pop or early electro-industrial get With Sympathy, Twitch or better yet, 12"" Anthology!"
1,"Another ""who cares"" CD from Ministry","First off, I have lost all respect for Ministry. What they have accomplished here is a big nothing. Next, I put on this CD and I thought that my stereo was broken from the poor recording. Ive heard local demo tapes made on 4 track recorders sound better than this garbage. What Ministry has done here in my opinion, is made a CD under contractual obligation with the record company, with little or no thought put behind it. Actually, what the real problem is for Ministry is that they are in too many bands (Lard, RevCo, 1000 homo DJ's etc..) and have forgot their main fans are Ministry fans. Without Ministry, their would not have been Lard, RevCo etc..Buy this CD and be dissapointed. I give this a 1 because the first song is the only good song on the CD. All the rest is bad"
3,"""Dark"" is a good description.","If the hotline of HELL had call waiting, this album would be on ""repeat."""
1,DOES NOT HAVE THE 2 EXTRA TRACKS,I bought this CD because of the 2 extra tracks and it does not have them. I was very disappointed.
2,"Well, at least it's better than ""Filth Pig""","After the rambling and inconsistent ""Filth Pig"", I expected Ministry to rebound with a great album. While ""Dark Side of the Spoon"" has it's moments, it is almost as disappointing as their previous album. It's aggressive, loud, and abrassive as just about any of their other material, but the passion that Al Jourgensen and co. have displayed for years just isn't here. Standout tracks include ""Supermanic Soul"", ""Step"", and ""Vex & Siolence"", but other than that it is clear why ""Dark Side of the Spoon"" didn't go over well with longtime Ministry fans. This proved to be Ministry's last album with longtime label Warner Bros. before being picked up by Sanctuary and returning to form with their most recent album ""Animositisomina""."
5,Loved This Book!!!,"Toure, Toure, TOURE!! This book was GREAT! Definitely want more from this slept on author. Folks need to wise up and check this book out and his other book, The Portable Promised Land, which is a collection of short stories.Highly recommended!!"
1,Soul-less city,"This book has been about the most unreadable thing I have attempted in years. Its just awful. Dont get me wrong, every book doesn't have to be great, but i hope for at least a new insight, a beautiful phrase or two.... this attempt might be worth it if it wasnt so tired...This is a magical book for those who have never been near a community or people with any shred of ""soul"". Thus, it may play well in manitoba....Filled with flat sterotypes, weak character development / interaction wherever it exists at all, this book ultimately left me as waiting for a magical portrayal of a soul or hip-hop community as when i mistakenly purchased it. Getting nick at night and seeing reruns of ""sanford & son"", ""what's happening"" or ""good times"" is a far better use of your life."
4,This Is A Great Comeback,"She may have been away for a while but Christina Milian is back, and she is looking and sounding better than ever. This album is brilliant, with tracks like the massive single Dip It Low, L.O.V.E, Peanut Butter & Jelly that make this album stand out.The album also features Joe Budden and Faboluos, It's About Time is a welcomed return for Christina Milian, So do yourselves a favour and buy this album, NOW!!!"
4,Its About Time....,"Exactly what the album is titled is right about Christina Milian it is about time that she has created yet another album...She truly has grown from AM to PM and you can tell with some of her sultry tunes like ""Someday One Day"" and ""Highway"" to her fast energy poppin songs like ""I Can Be That Woman"" and ""Peanut and Jelly""....Of course you can not forget ""Dip it Low"" that is a HOT song....I can definitely say that this album is very good and usually I dont buy albums but this album I will buy...For me to like this album you know it is a HOT album...Just go and get it you will love it..."
5,one of the best pop and r &b albums ever!,"christina milian's japan import album is one of the best pop and r&b albums ever. some of the best songs are ""spending time""(f.chuk),""am to pm"",""when u look at me"",""a girl like me""(f.jd)""get away""(f.ja rule) and ""it hurts when"". plus bonus tracks,""thank u"",""let go"" and ""You Snooze, You Lose""."
4,Beyonce who??,"Good job Christina! I got this CD for my mom and she likes it. I myself would have prefered something with more of a pop sound. BUT, it's about time someone came out to kick Beyonce off her ""pedestal"" and Christina is just the one to do it. Not only is her voice better, but she is 199% prettier! I would have liked her to include at least ONE song in Spanish on her CD because she IS Latina and there aren't enough crossover artists as it is. Come on girl, knock Beyonce and Britney off the countdowns and the so-called ""hot"" lists!"
4,Good but not at her best,"Milian is gorgeous 4 sure but I expected more from ""it's about time"".I think this cd misses smash hits, although dip it low and LOVE are very good, the rest is not unforgivable.But you should listen the cd and look her beautiful body!!"
2,It's About Time she realizes this ain't that good!,"I Don't know how Christina Milian thought that this album was hot. With a single like ""Dip It Low"" i expected more of an urban pop kind of album but what I got was songs like ""L.O.V.E"" and ""Down For You"" which sounds just like Thalia's horrible English song ""I Want You"". However, the album is not all bad. ""Hands On Me"" reminds me of ""Dip It Low"" with the fast beat. ""Miss You Like Crazy"" should be her next single, but she probably won't spare us and release something like ""I Can Be That Woman"". Ughhhhhh! Other highlights include ""7 Days and ""Oh Daddy"" and ""Someone One Day"" sounds like something Aaliyah would sing."
2,Where did the whistle go?,"Oh I liked this teapot enough when it worked. The harmonic whistle always got my attention, and to give it credit it lasted about 2 years but then it stopped whistling without warning and I nearly boiled the water aways since I can be forgettful at times. My other issue was the lid can get very hot so if you are removing it to steep tea bags you need to pull it off with a towel. Also the handle and your hand are in the way of filling it so you kind of have to hold it a bit sideways to fill."
2,NO WHISTLE = DANGER,"I agree with several others about the dangers of this kettle, as beautiful a design and as great a whistle as it has AT FIRST. After more than a year the whistle has not been consistent and certainly no longer has the great train sound. I put on water for a cup of tea, got busy, did not hear a whistle and when I finally realized something was wrong, the plastic cap melted, the plastic attachment to the metal part of the cap melted/broke, and the lid plastic was a bubbling mess! This could have caused a very real problem on the gas stove top! I thought it was ""just me"" until I read the reviews as I looked for a replacement. I will not replace with another Chantal."
1,Stopped whistling afer a year or so,It's a nice looking kettle but it failed in its most important and pretty simple function of whistling only a year after purchase. It still holds water but it's become dangerous to boil it.Maybe it can become a watering can.Waste of money.
4,Set of Security bits,The set of security bits were of good quality and I received several different kinds of bits to cover almost any type of security screws. A good choice of security bits for the money.
5,great set!,"this set contains every bit you could possibly ever need, and then some. nice, heavy, solid bit set, with decent delivery time too!"
4,cool but tight,The shirt is awesome but a bit on the tight side. Women's shirts are aways too tight... lame. It is soft stretchy and comfy though. Fast delivery.
2,Go Diego Go Bowling,"When I first bought this item, I expected it to be a big hit with both my sons. I gave it to my oldest for his 6th birthday and he was thrilled to have his own bowling alley. We put it together and they started to play. It lasted one whole hour before it broke. The pins jammed, and yes they were playing with it how it is supposed to be played with which is by throwing the ball at it. According to the booklet, you are supposed to turn it off and then back on when this happens. Thats what I did and it didn't work. The pins just make a horrible sound and they don't move. It says not to return product to place of purchase but the toll free number to call with problems is open at very inconvenient times so I have not been able to get a hold of the manufacture yet. So, buyer beware. It looks great but obviously it has some flaws with the electronic parts. It plays music with a strike and spare and resets pins (if not jammed. My son loved it until it broke."
1,Minature bowling alley!!!,"Wow, how seriously can you misrepresent an item and get away with it?? This item looks so large on the box and in all the advertisements but it is like a mini bowling alley!! It actually stands only 11 1/2 inches---thats less than one foot tall!!! Even though I purchased it on sale, I'd say it is not worth it. Another writer had it on the money when she said there is no way a child (mine are 3 and 6) can stand up and bowl with this. They have to sit infront of it and roll the ball in order to see the pins. A note to sdvertisers--just tell it OR in this case--show it like it is and let the consumer decide if they want to buy what the item ACTUALLY is!! Tricking people is not good business practice!!"
2,So others are not fooled,This is a fun toy for my three year old. However the size is seriously misrepresented. A child standing would not be able to even see the pins. Its actually a pretty small toy. If your child does not mind sitting and bowling its fun if for nothing else the automatic ball return. The picture on here and on the box must have been photo shopped. My three year old is just average sized and the top comes to just about his knee.
5,LOVED IT,GOT IT AT A SPECIAL PRIZE. IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND MY HUBBY AND I LOVED IT. ITS GREAT BIBLE REFERENCE
4,"Reading this book, with difficulties","This is a great book but hard to read, the letters are extremely small, if this matter could improve, this product would be exceptional."
5,Greatest,This is helpful resource to everybody interested in go deep in the study of the word. Great tool to me in my seminary student life.
2,I don't like it.,"The quality of the book is very poor. The pages inside look like they were made out of cheap copy paper. They are so thin, It is hard to turn the pages. The book looks like an imitation of the real one. Do not recommend buying online, it would be best togo to an actual book store and see for yourself."
3,it does'nt smell like colone it smells like soap,I did'nt like this and did'nt know you can buye at the store
4,"Exceptional player,excellent music.",Jesse Cook has the heart of a gipsy and the skills of a classically trained musician.The result of this unusual combination is a an album brimming with beauty where the artist's great technique does not get in the way of songs but rather enhances their very inspired magic.
5,A treasure,"I fell in love with Mario Takes a Walk on a local light jazz radio show, and tracked it down to this album. The whole album is a good as that favorite track, and so is Cook's Tempest. I never get tired of either of them"
4,Let's ban electric guitars,"If you've forgotten what a subtle instrument a guitar is , how it can delicately convey emotion, how when the right pressure is applied to strings the echo of the chord can remain with you for what seems like forever, and why technique should rule over volume - then this album is for you. You should probably also enjoy world music. This album is a lovely selection of Flamenco guitar. It is subdued yet you can definitely feel the passion of the music. Ideal as a non-intrussive album as background for conversation with friends. Guaranteed that at the first break in conversation, someone will ask ""Who's playing the guitar?"""
3,new flamenco,"first let me tell you that I think jesse cook is a great guitarist BUT, and this is important; what's up with all the synthesizers? Using flamenco guitar in poppy kinda songs is a great idea but why does every new flamenco artist want to make his music sound like it's from outher space?"
1,This is not his best. Gravity Falls.,"Gravity is not Jesse Cook's best album. If you heard Tempest, then this is a really tepid follow up. Felt like elevator music on first listen. Cook is in one of his more sombre moods and it seemed like he wanted to keep it slow and serene. Trouble is he made it boring at the same time. Where was the gusto of Tempest? It's not that bad seriously, but I expected better and felt let down. Not a good way to spend my money. If you want Cook's best, listen to Tempest and Vertigo."
2,Technical Skill Over Art,"Why didn't I like this? Maybe it's the modern jazz influence common to Nuevo Flamenco (perhaps that explains the Kenny-G hair). Or perhaps it's Mr. Cook's desire to show us how fast he can play rather than to compose artistic music first and back it up with technical skill second. So portions are indeed energetic and playful, you might say 'cutesy,' and that may be enough for you, but the more I played it the more I felt that it lacked soul and deepth. I liked the Middle Eastern influence but in track 8 the heavy drums choke it out."
4,What an ending.,"I picked up this book absolutely clueless to what I was about to read. I had read the back cover, and it seemed intriguing so I gave it a chance. I think that my use of the word intriguing is an understatement, becasue Special is so much more than that. Although I think that the characters are very mature for their age, I think that Bathurst captures the cruelty that teenage girls enflict upon one another. I highly reccommend this book for those girls 14 and up. The graphic descriptions might be a little too graphic for those who aren't mature enough to handle it. However, be prepared for an intense, and shocking ending. Also be prepared for a cliffhanger that leaves the actual events up to your imagination."
3,Arabic children's book,This is really an English book with Arabic subtitles. It reads the English way rather than the Arabic way. Cute book though
1,Save your money,I was hoping to get some real information on my son's illness instead I got the same information I can get on the web for free!!The only reason I gave it one star is because I had to in order to continue!!
5,Very encouraging and honest,"The Homeschool Journey is very encouraging to those of us considering teaching out of the home. The honesty in sharing the family stories shows us that the ""teacher"" need not be perfect, just willing to listen, learn and adapt to their children's learning needs. This book offers a variety of resources from mentoring and community involvement to individual books and curriculum, all the while stressing the need to tailor the teaching to each individual child. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about homeschooling their children...it's given me courage."
4,Decent book,The book is a detailed history of Africa. It is a text book so it it is little on the dry side.
3,Good general overview,"I have to be honest and admit that until reading this book I was very uninformed about the history of Africa outside of Egypt and Ethiopia and in any other periods than the ancient and Medieval. This book was a great general introduction to the history of Africa from the dawn of man through to modern times. The illustrations and pictures, both modern and historic, that were featured were very helpful in bringing the subjects to life. The flow of the text itself helped very much in connecting the dots and helping me to understood the flow of African history from one event, period, person, etc. to the next. Overall, I would recommend this is a good general introduction to the history of Africa that would come in use to someone who, like me, knew little to nothing about the history of this great continent."
3,Nice little piece of cheese,"This silly ""horror"" (more like goofball erotic comedy) film is impossible to take seriously and is amateurish at best, but this is one of the things that makes it fun to watch. Its laughs are more unintentional than they are intentional, but this adds to the pleasure of watching it. There's nudity, very little of it really shocking or serious, and there are special effects, all of them cheap and obvious. This isn't a film for horror buffs or even erotica buffs... this is something to heckle with friends on a Friday night when there's nothing else to do. Laugh at the wooden acting, the unimaginative camera work, the lack of story, any of it or all of it. It's quite amusing."
4,simply amazing B movie,"the 3 original scream quenns Brinke, Linnea,and Michelle. If you like satire and really cheesy B movies then you will ove this movie it has something for everyone."
1,"Regrets, I've had a few....","Sure wish I hadn't wasted time and money on this one. Two words: Stupe Id!A few minutes of Brinke, Linnea and Michelle nude can't begin to compensate for the agony of watching bad acting, hearing awful background music/noises and even SMELLING the stench of this one. Stay away."
2,FOR a few more DOLLARS and alittle extra space the XP3 is better,"I bought the xP1 for a 26gallon tank, but really wasn't doin the job. I purchased a 30gallon tank for DISCUS ( but NEVER buy that fish from mail order - def not from SOMETHINGSPHISY-is a SCAM) and this xP2 thinkin that it would perform better, then I would buy the second xP2 for the first tank. TO my dismay I still wasn't happy, I bought the xP3, and find it works better, has more room for BIO stars, media, a pillow softer bag, etc etc etc. Its taller so it takes up more room, but the best part the tubing housing is enter-changable. The xp3 will be going on my 50gallon tank."
5,Rena 721 Filstar XP2 Canister Filter,I setup my 29 gallon fish tank with this Rena 721 Filstar XP2 Canister Filter.It is so quiet that I cant hear it even when I open the door on my fish tank stand.It came with all of the media.This filter is awesome!Easy to setup and put together.My water is Crystal clear.
5,Workhorse that is easy to clean,"This is a simple and efficient canister filter that gets the job done and is easy to clean.The cleaning is big for me because we have two turtles, and they are notoriously messy. The top just pops right off, you rinse everything out, change your media, fill it up, and you are good to go. I had a Fluval 405 and a Fluval FX5 previously. While in theory they should not be much harder to clean, they literally took me an hour to get cleaned right, while the Rena takes me only about 10 minutes. That makes me clean it more often which makes for a cleaner tank, which makes for happy turtles."
5,How easy was that?,"As another reviewer pointed out, it does take a little bit of effort to put this thing together. Getting those tubes onto the fittings was a lot of work, but at least there's no dripping.Once this was done, and the filter media was in the box, priming the unit was simple enough. Open the tube at the top, pour in some water, then power the unit on. It will not be silent right away. There's still air trapped in the system, and there'll be a few ""burbs"" from time to time when these air bubbles are pushed out. But once that is all done, it really is whisper-quiet.Now, changing filter media. The first time I tried this, I was a little worried, but there's nothing to it. Shut the filter off, pop up the lever on the hose-fitting assembly and remove it. It's sealed off, so no dripping water. Now just carry the whole container to where you want to be to replace the filter media, pop the canister open and remove the two media trays. Replace as needed.How easy was that?"
4,Merl Sanders,"This DvD is loaded with great music.If youre buying it to see Jerry Garcia in action, there are many others out there which will give better/ longer footage.However, not only is this a good disc of Saunders' music but it serves as a very cool documentary to life and culture of the Amazon region as well.For the price, this is definatly a good buy!"
2,User hostile,"The type is too small and the columns are too wide; reading this book gives me a headache. If there are helpful hints buried in the avalanche of gushing prose about the author's chic and exciting life, I can't find them.The recipes are organized by the spices/condiments they require, so that chicken dishes, salads, ices, etc. are scattered randomly throughout the book. The index at the end is organized by ingredient, so good luck finding a salad!I don't mind cookbooks in which the recipes are all-mixed-up, if they're organized by ""suggested meals"" and then there's a comprehensive index at the rear, in which you can find all the salads, all the desserts, etc., as well as an index by ingredients.I bought this book on a whim and I'm sorry I wasted the money."
2,not very comfortable in between toes,"Daniel Green has such a wonderful reputation that I did NOT hesitate to purchase their Thong slipper --Since I'm a Type 1 diabetic, I must be very careful regarding the care of my feet --the ""thong"" is too hard and hurts inbetween the toes. This is a huge disapointment to meI've tried washing them several times and --to date --it has NOT gotten any softer.Bought a CHEAP pair of slipper thongs and the thong is made of a SOFT SOFT material that does NOT hurt inbetween the toes."
4,not bad.. but not so durable!!,not bad... ive used them quite a bit.. and WASHED them... if you follow the washing instructions they stay intact and in good shape.. ONLY THING.... smarter to get a dark color..... if you have a dusty place like me.. the discoloration won't QUITe go away in the washing... but that is not the fault of the manufacturer...Good purchase!
3,msifit,Item was for Honda Crv and curvature was a little off. Fasteners were too small and I had to come up with my own. Item was on time and in good shape. Amazon did it's job.
2,Dissapointing construction,"I had a heck of a time trying figure out the instructions and only then realized that the attachment pins, weren't long enough and hardy enough to stay locked-in their holes, to keep the hood shiled in place. I am still hopeful that I can find some soft plastic attachment pins, that are about a half-inch longer. I do not have the hood attached to my 2002 CRV at this time."
4,Looks Great but generic fitting screws,"I received the Bugflector yesterday. It shipped very quickly with the Prime service. As others have noted, I also had issues with the installation screws. I went to Ace Hardware and after searching for about 45 minutes and making several trips out to the CR-V for fitment checks, I found a simple yet very effective solution.All you need are (4) black plastic automotive body clip plugs. They were .38 cents each and simply push in and secure very tightly. Be sure to get them as tight as will fit in the hole. They were in the screw/bolt aisle and in the ""specialty"" section. I tested one out and pushed it in a bit and had to pull and pull and almost had to borrow a set of pliers to get it out! Hope this helps.Other than that little issue, the product looks very good on this CR-V. It makes it look classy and most CR-Vs don't have them."
2,Poorly made...,"I decided to buy this after reading all of the reviews and I'm sorry to say that I wish I had listened to the lower raters. This is a very poorly made product. The plaque itself is very nice and sturdy but the hands on the clock and the thermometer are really cheap and flimsy. When I got it out of the box the hands were all bent and a piece of the hand for the thermometer was broken off. The hook for hanging on the back is actually the thermometer itself so if you have to twist it to hang level (which I did) then it moves the hand on the thermometer.As for the temp being wrong...it was, but there is a way to adjust it to read properly once it acclimates to the temperature.I was able to finagle it enough to work and decided to keep it just because I didn't want to hassle sending it back. If you are OK with bending the arms and manually adjusting the temp a few times then this is OK. If not, I suggest looking somewhere else."
4,Outdoor Wall Clock,"Ever had an item you hated to depart with??? I had a great outdoor clock which was made out terra cota material. Anyway, we got some very nice wind last year and I forgot to mount (properly) so it fell off the hinge and broke. I had been looking for a replacement for some time. This item is very good with regards to quality and functionability. The only hitch is it is somewhat dark but it does a good job of being a versatile unit by allowing you to have a clock/temp gauge. The artwork is very nice and if you are looking for something that is practical, appreciate unique items where you will not find everybody on the block with the same unit......you will find this a great bargain."
3,Terra Cotta Outdoor clock/thermometer,This is very nice appearing but hard to read form anny distance. We hung it in our pool area and have to be within 5ft to read it. So far it is holding up to the weather.
5,very nice,my husband loves this and it is nice to have such a good looking clock outdoors that is decorative.
4,The late art historian's personal view of civilization,"Kenneth Clark's book pales just a bit next to the TV (now video) series by the same name, just because you can't hear him expound his exquisitely cultured views in that elegant, thatchy-tweedy-frightfully-awfully-wonderful voice of his. Plus of course there's no sound track. But no matter--this book is a guided tour through the inner workings of the West's creative impulse itself. Also, it's a damned fine art travelogue. It's frightening to think how all the achievements traced in this book--the very glory of Western civilization--have been jettisoned by the universities nowadays, the better to worship at the altar of the Left's holy trinity: race, sex, and class. Well, their God is too small, and thirty pages into _Civilisation_ the reader will be grateful for the corrective he now holds."
1,"Defective, should've paid attention to the other reviews!!",The game with the Pittsburg Steelers is missing. It was the Atlanta Falcons game on this disc instead. Do not buy until someone fixes the problem!!!!
1,Missing Game,"I'm a huge Browns fan and I ordered this as soon as i found out this was available. I was at the falcons game in '02 and have great memories of bernie and the dawg pound defense of the mid-late 80s. i was only 2 during the kardiac kids season, but was excited to watch this too. the falcons game was great - watched that 1st, good quality. however, when i put the squeelers disc in - which was labeled as such - it was another copy of the falcons game. 1 star is not a commentary on the dvd, but the fact that one game was missing. very frusterating. will return and try again though. i'm not sure why more games aren't available. i'd buy a bunch of these sets. the nfl (and mlb) need to get their act together and put out more dvds - just with better quality control."
1,Only 2 games here what a rip off!!!,"This was horrible I got this for my husband and how disapointing!! It is supposed to be a Cleveland Browns 3 clasic game dvd set. It is supposed to contain 3 different dvd's with a different game on each dvd. Well, 2 of the dvd's have the same game on them. My husband was so mad because the game He was soooo wanting to see was labled right but when he put it in the dvd player and pushed play the game from the last one he had just watched was on it."
2,Missing some games,"OK I am a steelers fan so I think the drive, the fumble, and red right 88 should be on here. As well as the 1994 and 2002 playoffs vs the Steelers.LOLOk all kidding aside, most of the Browns greatest games happened before color tv. LOL. But I think the 1986 playoff vs the Jets should be on here. 1987 playoff vs Colts. 1989 playoff vs buffalo, 1994 wildcard win vs Patriots. Other suggestions, 1986 win at Pittsburgh (the broke the jinx to my dismay). 1999 win at Pittsburgh. 1986 win at Cincy to win AFC Central. 1980 win vs cincy to clinch division. 1989 win vs Denver and Houston. 1976 win vs Steelers (turkey jones game)."
2,Review of Amazon presentation of this item,"The item itself might be fine, I will never know. I was about to order it on December 9 when I realized that no matter which shipping option I chose, it could not be here before Christmas- even if I paid $40 to overnight it! What? It must be a problem with the store. Do not choose this store if you need an item in any reasonable amount of time.Also, I had to search several other websites to find out which games were on this set. They might want to note that, as it's sort of important. Chalk this lost sale up to not enough information and slow shipping."
3,Not the greatest games,"The greatest Browns games came well before the three included in this package. The Browns haven't even smelled a championship since 1964 when they beat the Colts for the NFL title--before the Super Bowl was invented. In the early days of the franchise, the Browns were dominant, year after year. I'd much prefer to see games from that period.If the truly greatest games were imcluded, we'd see Jim Brown, Otto Graham, Milt Plum, Gary Collins, Marion Motley, Bobby Mitchell, Lou Groza, Mac Speedie, Horace Gillam et al., not the relatively meaningless games in seasons that were scarcely memorable. This is not to say that the games here are not interesting, but ""greatest?"" I don't think so."
3,Games are great but the packaging is not....,"I was excited to receive my Browns DVD collection today. Unfortunately the packaging was all messed up. The sleeves did not represent the discs in inside them (no big problem there, I just switched the sleeves), however, the disc labeled for the Steelers v Browns game on my set is actually the Browns v Falcons game (and vice-versa). Still great to have these games archived on DVD, but the quality control on these is bad. Just want to know if this happened on others or just mine before I complain to Warner Brothers."
3,LOVED THIS! LOGAN REALLY KILLED THE PACKERS WOW! THE REST OF THE GAMES ARE GREAT TOO!!,"EVEN THOUGH THE THIRD DISC WOULD SKIP FROM THE 2ND QUARTER TO THE FOURTH.I ENJOYED THIS! SPENT MONEY ON GETTING THE 3RD DISC REFURBISHED,IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM,BUT WORKED WELL IN MY PC!!!!!IF YOU LOVE THE BROWNS,STILL BUY THIS!!!!!!! NOTE:IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET THE 3RD DISC CLEANED,I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 5 STARS."
5,Browns,Enjoyed it very much and still looking for any more Browns dvds of complete games with Sipe or Kozar at the qb spot
3,You get what you pay for...,"I was looking for speakers for my PSP so I could listen to the music on it like a boom box. Unfortunately, I could not find the Logitech Playgear Amp anywhere online so I settled for the PSP iSound. The sound quality is not great but for the price I paid ($7 shipped), it was ok. The drawback of these speakers is that they don't have an input for an AC adapter so you always have to have 3 AAA batteries available.In closing, if you can find the Logitech speakers go with those, otherwise you can pick these up but only if you can get them cheap like I did."
3,Not bad for 0.99 cents,I was looking for portable speakers that attach to my PSP. I looked at two other speakers that looked cool and had good reviews. But hey you can't beat a sweet deal of 99 cents for these speakers. They sound ok no threater or surround sound here...just loud. Still for 99 cents I'm happy with them but would not pay more.
5,Quality bedding,"Bought top, bottom sheets and pillow case and all are good quality and wash well. They fit a hospital bed perfectly so good for home use. Also soft and comfortable for the patient. Will buy more if needed."
5,Fantastically Ferocious,These wall decals are great. They look great and do really peel off without harming the paint. We put one on crooked and peeled it off and put it back on. No problems at all. Great produce.
1,Based on the description this is a HUGE waste of money,The description states (copy & paste): Sizes from 2 inches to 8 feet. We took this to mean that the smallest portion of the decal was 2 inches and the largest portion was 8 feet. It is maybe a foot by a foot. Since my son saw it when I opened it not knowing what came in such a small box he wanted it so I couldn't return it. We expected a much bigger box and was going to be a surprise. So much for that. We were looking for something much bigger based on this description. I have shopped Amazon for years and this is the first time I have ever been disappointed
5,love it,"would buy it again. Good quality, easy to install. Make the car look good and protect windshield from weather & bugs."
1,can't install,game was advertised to work om win xp but after installing game it would not open and gave a message that the master could not be found..i tried to get it to work on win xp pro 32 and 64 bythe systemsi am truly disappointed...cllawson1
1,Faulty Advertisement,"The advertisement stated Links LS Classic (Jewel Case)...What I received was two discs in white sleeves, no Jewel Case and no paperwork..Unacceptable and makes me leary of using Amazon again..."
4,"Recommended, very good","As someone still new to short term missions, I very much recommend this book. It is written by a cardiologist who has been on several short term missions in recent years. The missions has been to central America and central Africa. The book truly is a comprehensive manual for planning and performing short term missions. The author provides his own numerous personal mission experiences. The book covers the logistical, social, psychological, spiritual, physical, mental, and financial aspects of short term missions. This book will help mitigate any fear or apprehension you may have in performing short term missions."
1,"OH MY GOD, THIS IS BAAAAD...","I read some of teh Shannara books when I was a kid. nice, but never worth going back to. I noticed that Brooks was still chugging along recently, so I bit and decided to see what was going on in one of my favorite childhood worlds.Ummm...nothing much worth reading about."
4,Pretty well written!,"First of all, Terry Brooks is a magnificent writer! I enjoyed this book greatly! Although to like this book, you have to like his style of writing, which he has established in his previous books! (Sword of Shannara, is my third all time favorite book, although I was disappointed in the Elfstones)A few things that I didn't really like was the beggining, just before they set out on the quest and Leah, is discouraging them: This is too much like the other books, and I thought it boring, and pointless, since I knew they would end up going anyways! I am really happy to see a relative of Panamon Creel back in the story! Oh, I must point out that this novel has a very fascinating and captivating ending!"
4,Exciting...yet iritating.,"This is a great book but I would rather know more facts about Wren, Walker, and Morgan than I would have about Coll and Par. The begining starts with Cogline, his character bothers me at the begining also, but he becomes a different person at the end. And Walker is a non-believer, but soon realizes what needs to be done whether he likes it or not. Par jumped straight to the challenge and didn't realize the consequences, and Coll wanted nothing to do with the visions, it just didn't blend well. Wren rejected everything about her past she didn't want to believe, but soon realized the truth and wanted to know more. Other than those parts this is a really great book."
3,Please read before you start this series,If I had just read this book I would've given it another star; it truely did suck me in. But be warned; the fourth book in the series falls totally flat after three exciting books. You will be let down.
2,Terry Brooks took a dive,"The first three Shannara books have a wealth of description and style. They introduced me to a Tolkien-like (some say too Tolkien-like) Epic on grand proportions. Perhaps too child-like, but I'm not so cynical yet. This book however (and the books following) just failed to live up to it. Maybe I had grown up too much by the time I read this book, but this series was a huge disappointment, after three stunning books. The world of the Ohmsfords is losing its magic, this book and series already did."
2,shame shame shame,"It took my two weeks to stop giving up on the Sword trilogy but after I got past the first 50 pages, I was hooked. Unfortunately, Scions was quite the let-down. It read like it was just thrown together...one those books that could have been condensed into 25 pages. But, I'll keep reading the series. Every now and then this happens in the big series...don't let one bad apple destroy the entire grove, right?"
3,NOT as good...,"Well, I thought that Druid was boring. I started reading it, and then kept reading it only to get through it. However, at about page 180, there is a part that is very relevant to Elf Queen (SOOO much better) so, just read that part and get to the good half of the series"
3,Not as pleasing as thought to be,"I would have expected more from Terry Brooks in this book. A new start of the series.... Something that I had expected to be more wonderful than it proved to be. Brooks seems to use an greater evil in his writing than before. A dark sense of writing you might say. He is most wonderful, as usual, is describing the characters and setting but isn't as good at the story itself. He seems to be less inspired than usual and rather bored with his piece of work. He really should do better than he's done in the ""Scions of Shannara""."
4,not too bad,"I was A bit disappointed in the fact that this book is only a part of a whole story. The other Terry Brooks books took place hundreds of years apart, but these are at roughly the same time. The whole story is really great."
2,Scions of Shannara - Terry Brooks rehashes faithfully,"This book, although not badly written, is exceptionally uninspired. The characters are rehashes of characters used in his earlier books almost exactly. His plot is somewhat tired as well; the little party on it's quest. As events happen, they don't seem to advance the story much, they are just the obligatory compications. Perhaps the most annoying facet of the story is the references to all his previous books and characters. I think it's nice to have a sense of continuity between series set in the same location, but here it comes across as if Brooks can't quit congratulating himself on everything else he's written previously. Brooks seems to have put little thought into this one. I'm not sure I will move on to the next; I may just reread Robert Jordan's series instead."
2,Not a recipe book!,"Although this book was well written, it was more a travelogue than a cookbook. There was beautiful photography but I had anticipated a greater variety of recipes.Deb"
5,Best Case Scenario,"(Sorry for the pun.) This is the best case I've ever had! I no longer worry about checking my guitar through baggage. Its been increasingly harder and harder to travel without having to worry if they'll let you on the plane and you'll miss your gig. This is a sturdy, well built and protective case. Comes equipped with TSA locks (so they won't break or cut yours off). The price is unbelievable! I shopped all over before I found this one at this price. Highly recommend it."
3,It's TOO BIG for a dreadnought,"TAKE MEASUREMENTS of your guitar before buying. This case is MUCH oversized and seems more appropriate for a jumbo than a dreadnought. I own two dreadnought guitars; neither of them fit snugly.It seems well-built, and after some waffling about whether to return it I guess I'll just keep it and hope for the best. But if you buy this, expect to add some more padding prior to handing over any prized instrument to the airline baggage monkeys."
2,Handle broke off with just a few uses.,"The handle to this case broke off in a very minor situation. There is no replacement available for this case either. So for $149 it does protect the instrument however, if the handle breaks, it's a pain to carry around. So, you might thinks about buying something else."
3,Not that good...,"I bought this instead of Martin case that came with the guitar.I felt the one that came with my martin guitar cheap, which sells for $100.But this, SKB 18, looked much more strong and better.So I sold my Martin case and now I am kind of regretting.Martin case had perfect fit, but this has room around the guitar.For protection, I rate about the same as martin one.Only I felt better was locking system. Other than that, I think it's no better case."
4,smaller than I pictured,"This is a pretty, small necklace. Only about 1 1/2"" across in diameter, but very shiny. The chain was quite short too, but that was expected."
2,chain to weak looks cheap,"like the neckelace except for the chain on another chain it would look nice, but the chain is to weak and looks cheap"
5,Extraordin Aire,"Initially I was disappointed that this release features Chuck Deardorf instead of Dan Dean on bass, since Collier & Dean make such a dynamite duo. I soon realized however that the sound is still very similar to Collier & Dean's 1979 ""Whistling Midgets,"" with Don Grusin reprising his role on Rhodes piano and Bud Shank providing excellent flute & sax.Over the years this album has received a lot of airplay at my house and has grown to be a solid favorite."
2,My [review],"Wow. I did some digging, and bought this album because I loved the New Radicals' album, as well as Danielle Brisebois(Gregg's girl) and Carly Hennessey. This one came out in 92, and man, is it dated. The songs retain the intelligence and wit which, once this artist grows up, are his obvious strengths..., however, they are all about how good he is in bed. Which as an audience member, is only entertaining for about 6 months in a lifetime. If you're like me, and need to get everything done by artists you really enjoy, this is one to skip. I probably won't listen to it again. But do look forward to more mature albums by Gregg and/or his band."
1,Agree 100% with the first review!,"Yes, I am one of those people that needs to have everything available from artists I love. I read that first review and decided to get it anyway. I should have taken the advice and saved my money. Sounds nothing like The New Radicals or Gregg's ""Michigan Rain"" CD. This CD sounds pretty dated and I also probably will not end up listening to it again and sell it on EBAY."
2,First song is good (that's about it).,"If you loved New Radicals' one and only album, keep listening to that. This solo album, however, is NOT good.... Just keep hoping for another NR album."
1,Flawed King Dinosaur,"I cant really recommend this set due to the flawed master copy of King Dinosaur.Starting at the 19:10 minute mark the image on screen breaks up into pixelised horizontal lines a total of 60 times through the movie at 16 different places. I've contacted the supplier and they've replied with:It is not a faulty disc. This is, unfortunately, a built in condition of the only master available for this film from it's legal owner Weiss Global Ent. and the same problem exists, I believe, in the official vhs release of a few years back.This is a real shame because the movie itself is hilarious.I guess the best thing to do is to wait until (hopefully) Rhino releases it as part of a future MST3K volume !"
4,Interesting insight into Mozart vocal practice,"Works by J. C. Bach and Mozart in their original version are contrasted with the ornamented versions by Mozart (by Corri in the case of Voi che sapete). While there are better versions of the familiar Mozart works, this recording is definitely worth a listen if you are interested in historical vocal practice or florid singing in general."
2,Nanotechnology? Well.,"Not exactly dealing with ""nanotechnology"". You can imagine the contents judging from the title, ""nanoworld"". Overemphasizes biological systems and gives some examples that are not related to nanotech. You will get a broad, ""shallow"" understanding of what has been done and is going on in a science field called chemistry."
2,my money down the drain as far as I am concerned!,"Without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. Gross just keeps rambling on about proteins, cells, DNA, etc. I did not pick up anything interesting and informative from reading this horrifically-written book."
4,Good book bad editor,This book was excellent in its content. I have done title closing classes by ripoff artists and never received the excellent quality of content as I did with this book. A++ for content. However the book was riddled with grammatical and typographical error and even with some of the numerical charts and examples that were used. Mr. Zirogiannis might want to get a better editor/proofreader for his next edition.
1,Again?!,"Okay, this album has been re-released TWICE now!! Come on, Columbia! How greedy can you get?! With this, all you're really getting is the same exact thing from the first re-release plus music videos for Angels and Take My Breath Away! I'm getting sick and tired of record companies repackaging new products and adding extra ""features"" to suck money out of people's wallets! I've already repurchased this album once and I'm not doing it again! If I want to see the music videos, I can go to Launch or Jessica's website!"
4,Best all around czech,"Best all around czech book if you are interested in learning. The text is very easy to follow and learn, but the accompanying cassettes are difficult. They are okay to hear conversation but they are hard to follow because the people on the tape speak very quickly, so i end up having to stop and rewind repeatedly."
2,Not for Beginners,"I don't understand the positive reviews given to this program. Yes, the book might be useful as a text, but the audio part of the program is next to useless for beginners. After the short audio introduction on pronunciation, the program proceeded to rattle off conversations which were unintelligible and impossible to imitate since there was no time for repetition. I tried to use the book to help, but found that the conversations did not follow the lessons presented there!If you want to try and learn to read Czech, maybe this is OK, but if you want to learn to speak the language I highly recommend the Pimsleur beginning Czech. After Pimsleur I plan on getting the Foreign Service Institute Czech series."
5,"This Should Be an ""Essential Recording""!",Bessie Smith's greatest collaborations with Louis Armstrong--need I say more? Two of the greatest artists of their time working together to create some of the greatest music of the entire century. This is the best of the Complete Bessie Smith volumes to have--this is the artist in her (recording) prime.
5,Another great Willie budget-priced set!,"This Willie retrospective is probably the most comprehensive for the price. This was used to promote the A&E; television biography that aired for Willie a couple of years ago.This set has 14 sides, and it spans all of his really big sides. I like 'Columbus Stockade Blues' a whole lot, and the live version of 'Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground' is simply irresistable. So, if you are just starting out with Willie or you are a lifelong fan like I am,this set is great to own.You'll get your money's worth with this one. And if you are nothing more than a casual fan of Willie's, this may be all you'll ever need.The sound quality is excellent as well.Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!"
3,"It's okay, but...","I got this CD as a donation gift for supporting my local public radio station (KUHF 88.7), and it was a worthwhile recompense for my donation dollars. I like it well enough--it's notbad, by any measure. Other reviewers have pointed out that it's not ""true"" Flamenco. I don't especially care...it sounds nice, I like it, nuff said. But to be completely honest, I would more quickly reach for 1) The Gypsy Kings 2) Jessie Cook 3) Willy and Lobo (not necessarily in that order) if I was suddenly moved to want to hear some ""Latin"" sounds. I used to put HEAT in the CD player when I wanted some nice background/mood music get me in the mood to do my Spanish homework. (Even though Jessie Cook is a total gringo [hey, so am i], the man can work a guitar pretty darn good!)...but to be fair if someone asked me to go to see Oscar Lopez perform live somewhere, I'd go along.HEAT makes a good first CD if you are just getting in to the various kinds of music of the Spanish-speaking world."
5,Oscar Lopez and Heat is excellent,I bought over a dozen CD's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often. Excellent musician and the recordings are clear and precise.
2,This CD is over-rated and lack of character,"I bought this CD because it has 5-star rating. I was so disappointed with the music. It is so plain and uncharacteristic. Nothing stands out in the CD. Personally I also own Duende, Fire and Grace, Obsession and Gypsy Soul. This one is clearly at the bottom."
5,Killer,This album rocks. I caught K-bird's live show and was blown away--the CD is even better; grind it out smashmouth rock'n'roll.
3,"Fun, but challenging","Bought the refill b/c my kids begged to be able to make more stickers for themselves. It seems like it should be a fun toy-- and it is kind of. Children under 8 will need help getting the sticker roll aligned properly. Once the roll is in place, they need help placing their little pictures (that will become stickers) into it without wasting LOTS of sticker paper. My kids go through a roll (one refill pack) in one sitting-- but will play with it for about 1 hr. It would be nice if the refill pack were cheaper too."
5,The only Sports Medicine book I own,"The Paperback version of this book was given to me free when I was a medical student in 1985. I practice rheumatology and am an athlete myself. Whenever a question comes up regarding an athletic injury, if I am not immediately familiar with the disorder or can't find information from other sources, I dust off this book. I can't recall a time when this book failed me or the patient. Its conservative approach with a big measure of wisdom makes it the best sports medicine book I have ever seen. With regard to non surgical treatments, it never seems to get out of date. For this reason it is probably the only textbook I still own dating back to my medical school years. The reason I accessed this site was to see if a revised edition exists, which sadly doesn't seem to be the case. This book is not only the best I have seen for a physicians use, but for a therapist or sophisticated athlete as well. I would welcome any information on a possible successor to this edition."
5,Best Sports Health Book,"We have owned this book for many years and reference it regularly. It has been loaned to a number of friends and colleagues many of whom purchased their own copies after reading it. The descriptions of injuries are excellent, and, although is was published a number of years ago, the the advice is still sound. I highly recommend it to anyone who plays sports or exercises or has family members who do so. It is also a great reference to have at gyms and company libraries. I highly recommend it."
1,mixer wasn't what came to me.,"I would love to give a review of the Nady 16 channel mixer that I ordered, but I can't. What I can review is the Nady near field personal monitor that was shipped. It seems that Amazon advertised the wrong product for the price advertised. After I got the wrong item, they fixed the ad...go figure... I agreed to keep the monitor, which is working perfectly, 2 of us can hear our vocals clear as crystal!My review, then would be for the only Amazon purchase I've ever made. I doubt that I'll use Amazon ever again...too bad...cause alot of dealers sell their wares through them.For $60.00 or so, the Nady near field personal monitor is a very good deal, however."
2,Dissapointed with packing of merchandise,"I ordered this from MV Trading Co. and when I received them bamboo handles were broken. They were packed in a very low quality padded manila envelope which they should have known would not stand up to USPS shipping. I e-mailed MV Trading for a replacement about 2 weeks ago and still have not heard from them. My advise to anyone planning to order from this company, pick another company. I will not order from them again."
4,Quite good,"I am certainly no expert cook, but skimmer does exactly what it is supposed to do. No complaints, but I can't say as I ""love it""."
3,poor design,the spider is not flat enough. it curls up and is hard to catch foods like egg rols. gonna buy a different one.
5,Awesome experimental and dubstep,"This is a great album if you want some mellow electronic and dubstep inspired music. This is more of an after-party album than anything, so don't expect roaring hoovers and throbbing basslines. Nice minimal drum work and ethereal synths fill all the songs with a relaxing comedown feel."
3,Mens wake up shower gel,This will wake you up on those early morning days. This is a waste of time being only two ounces. Go for a larger size and look for anything with menthol or peppermint oil.
2,Too much,"I like horror films, always have, and I've seen my fair share of gore. But this movie seemed to be made ONLY to show gore. I didn't even finish watching it."
5,Use it all the time,"Very hady not only for deep frying in the wok, but for fishing raviloi and other pasta out of a large pot of boiling water instead of straining. A must have tool in the kitchen and for the price, you really can't go wrong."
2,Not a brass spider like the description claims,The Spider is constructed well but it's stainless steel (I assume) and not brass like advertised. It does stick to food (unlike brass) and If I knew it was not brass I would not have purchased it. Now I have to find an 8 inch spider that really is made of brass.
3,Too big to be properly useful,"I do a lot of Chinese style cooking in the cooler months and while a wire `spider' the brass woven tool here is invaluable for plucking hot food out of hot oil without bringing along excess oil. that being said, you do not need an 8 inch wide one. It's just too big. If you're using this just back up and ask `why?"" Seriously, that big gets hard to control and the size of it's webbing is going to agitate more oil in your cooker. A 6 inch'er is about as much as you need and only the price. Better yet instead of paying shipping you can get it in most good grocery stores for about $4.50 and save yourself the shipping costs and delays."
4,for simple circuits,"The maths is pretty simple. At least, you should think so, given that this book should be revision for you. It doesn't really go far into any involved maths. Just enough is covered to enable the description of basic circuit elements - resistor, capacitor and inductor. And to describe the AC impedance of a little circuit. A very minimalist approach.The book feels like a high school level offering. One would hope that at the university level, more advanced discussions of circuits would occur."
3,THE ABSOLUTELY ULTIMATE CHRISTMAS,"There are 4-selections-a movie-THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, a danny kayemovie (nothing about christmas) justsilliness. A Set (4) Christmas cartoons (cute), a selection of singing and non-singing christmas music and about 20 sing a-long songs. There is one screensaver through-outthe dvd, wraped christmas gifts whichis marred by instructions on how togo forward or back on a track.Sowhy buy this dvd ?--buy it for the music, you will enjoy many beautiful christmas songs and have fun with the sing a-longs."
5,Learning to see,"This is a basic book. It takes like 45 min to read, and a whole life to put to practice. Buy copies of this book and give them to everyone in your company. It details the first, most basic step of any business improvement startegy: learn how to observe and map your processes. No improvement can be achieved if you do not know what is happening right now."
4,Great for discreet manufacturing,This book focuses on value stream mapping for physical products. It is not that useful for process value stream mapping.
5,Customer Review,"This book is written just like a book on lean manufacturing should be: short, to the point, and no crap. It's very informative, easy to read, a no academic wishy-washy stuff. A great buy!"
4,Learning to draw valuestream diagrams!,"Book info : 3rd edition published in 2003.Pre required knowledge: SMED, Continuous Flow ManufacturingPurchased price : USD 17,50This book is a workbook, it does not handle a lot of theoretical stuff on LEAN. Also it relies on SMED and Continuous flow manufacturing and KANBAN, so if you're not familiar with that, you will need to do some reading on those topics as well.Basically this book gives you a technique how do draw you current value stream with all the necessary details. Next it explains how to draw your future value stream and what to do to get there (on paper and on the shop floor). Be careful it does not say how to get thereThe book is not very complicated and the way it is explained every fool can do the trick. What I found pity was that the majority of the book goes on the production process. It does not say a lot on the office value stream. Still, I can recommend this book to everybody that is looking for a practical starter on LEAN."
2,OK for VSM Book,"This is regarded as the source of all VSM books it is very leaned out. There are better VSM books than this, need for more VSM examples."
5,Congratulations on Searching for real answers!,"Walter Williams is a man of integrity, that's why he consistenty seeks to persuade, not to coerce.Buy this book and vote Libertarian in and beyond!"
5,Williams for President,Amazing insight to what America is supposed to be. If only our politicians understood the issues like Walter Williams. Williams for President!!!!!!
5,great album,is great sounding and i really enjoyed the memories this album brought back fast shipper and great deal and brand new
5,Leslie & The boys,A great Mountain album ! What else can I say.If you don't have this one go out and get it NOW !
4,Definitely No Mountain Higher,"This album is just amazing, just too bad it didn't have Nantucket Sleighride, I know that's their next album, but boy it would have fit perfectly with this set. But still this album is jam packed with the best rock and roll money can buy. Mississippi Queen, a classic always will be. I have to say though Theme For An Imaginary Western is a hell of alot better jam song though and gets no airplay on any regular classic rock station, boy what a shame there. Never In My Life packs the punch and as always loud as hell. To My Friend a good little acoustic number. But just like the CD says it was meant to be played LOUD, enjoy."
5,Dean Vendetta XM,"I recieved this guitar and i thought it was absolutely amazing, Whoever is saying this guitar doesn't hold good tune is wrong, the finish is beautiful and its awesome to play in all tunings, pickups is or almost the best stock pickups that i have ever played and i have played alot of guitars, and messed with different pickups, this guitar is a good guitar for anyone thats on a budget, and it should be more than its priced for, the guitar on a scale to 1-10 is a 10. I recommend this guitar for anyone."
5,Vendetta,"This guitar rocks as far as the sound goes. I play metal and for me this guitar delivers. You cant beat the price either, got mine for $109. The guitar body DOES NOT look like the one shown in the picture, it is more brown then the grainy one pictured. I DIDN""T but it for the paint scheme though, so that did not bother me. I would personally choose this one over the black one."
1,Cheap in every sense of the word,"The parts were barely screwed together. It came with scratches. Protective packaging was non-existent. It is not the same guitar as the one in the picture. It was barely screwed together. And it sounded like trash. Luckily, I was able to return it. But, it only cost $120 so I really couldn't expect much better."
4,EXCELLENT BUY,"I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS GUITAR BEFORE I BOUGHT MY EPIPHONE. THE ONLY THING THAT IS WRONG FOR ME IS THE VOLUME KNOB IS TO CLOSE TO WHERE I LIKE TO STRUM, I KEEP TURNING THE VOLUME DOWN. IF YOU BUY THIS UNIT GET A QUALITY AMP, IF YOU HAVE A CHEAP ONE IT DOESN'T DO THE GUITAR JUSTICE."
3,Pic inaccurate....,"First, it doesn't look like the pic. It's much darker and you don't really see any of the wood grain, as represented in the picture. So beware.And the description is deceptive. Mahogany finish, but it's a Paulownia body, so it's not Mahogany. Unless Paulownia and Mahogany are the same but I don't think they are.IGNORE the light colored image above the description on the Amazon product page...But you get what you pay for, and $117 isn't too bad for a practice guitar to throw in the back of the car."
3,Good Beginner's Piece,"As an old guy wanting to play guitar, this was a great buy. I also got the Behringer 15 watt amp to go along with it. The guitar comes with a patch cord and nothing else. No instruction book on what the knobs and switches are for. It was shoddily packaged, but not damaged; looks as if they just threw it in the box with some shipping paper. I need to update as others have mentioned. It is not the shiny, sparkling piece you see. It has a flat to satin finish. Pretty, but no shine."
1,Looks nothing like the picture,"This guitar would have been awesome if only it was a gorgeous mahogany finish like pictured in the listing. I received a drab, ugly, sickly looking wood guitar that has no sheen or shine. The wood is much, much darker than what is pictured. It makes me rethink online purchasing...you never get what is promised..."
1,If only zero stars were a choice....,"This is easily the most consistent disc I have ever heard. Everything about it is terrible. The talent, terrible. The production, terrible. The arrangements, terrible. I have lost 45 minutes of my life that I can never recapture. Please click on something else as soon as possible. Go buy William Hung. Go buy Celene Dion. Hell, go buy William Shatner. Just please, for the love of God, do not buy this record."
4,"Complete,compresive and very much tecnical","This is a good book.it's a clear and compresive book,which have all topics about the plastics failure and explain about materials factors,selection of materials,design,processing until the quality control and legals aspects of failure. The languaje used is very tecnical."
3,strange and skimpy collection,not a very representative collection of Merle Haggard's work...get these songs from different compilations
1,return to forever-live,"I love there studio albums from the days of Airto and Connors up to the classic lineup of Corea, Clarke, DiMeola and White. But, this live double header is to artsy fartsy for me. And who the hell is that woman singing! And why! This is classic fusion jazz! It should be insrumental for crissake! Save your money. I wish I did.J. Guida"
5,Must have hot Biblical Historicity students,"This book can be only described with one word. AMAZING!The insight and knowledge of the late Isaac Asimov is shown here with such an amazing simplicity. He can explain the mystery of life in laymen's terms with extreme ease.This book, while vast and detailed, is a must have for all the people that have that itch to understand all the mysteries of the bible and only find books that only confuses them more."
5,Are there no limits to Asimov's knowledge?,"Is there any subject on which this man is not an expert? It's too bad he's dead, so he can't write another thousand books or so. Sheesh. What a man."
5,"I may be a Heretic if you want, but this book is greate!","You can call me a heretic for reading this, but this book is all that you need to truly understand the Bible. Specially with today's End of the Millenium mumbo jumbo, this book is a most. Highly Recomended!"
3,I really wanted a scholarly work cross referenced,"This book was a big undertaking. But the book says that all the information was derived from ""commonly available"" books in libraries and encyclopedias. I've seen a few encyclopedias and I'm sure they conflict on many points (dates events occured, which Pharoe Joseph served under etc). I corresponded with Asimov's heirs at Boston U and they told me I was on my own when it came to research."
5,"Thought provoking, enlightening, highly recommended.","The amount of research that must have gone into this work is astounding. Paragraph after paragraph makes one stop and think, reading passages in the Bible that correspond to what Asimov has said, referring to other sources to see what THEY say. A mind expanding book, stimulating and informative... I've learned something new every time I opened it."
5,Things they don't teach in Sunday School,"Asimov's book is a good reference book for anyone reading the bible. As I read it in tandem with the bible, it kick-starts my critical thinking skills, and teaches me history. It reminds me that there are more versions of history than just (ancient) Israel's version."
5,Great secular view of the Bible,"Asimov's book gives a very good secular view of the Bible and puts the events occuring in the Bible into historical perspective. It also provides an understanding of the the structure of the Bible, e.g., what is considered canonical (by Jews, Catholics, Protestants), who likely wrote what (although the scholarship may be dated), what was occuring in history when the various books were written, etc. Consider this a book for Bible 101 to teach basic Bible literacy."
3,"Secular, but accurate enough when compared with lexicons.","Some people will be offended by the secularism but I cannot say it doesn't make a good additional commentary on the Bible, and can be used effectively with many of the post-KJ translations, if used with Strong's."
4,"Dated, but so what","This is one of the best books ever on biblical studies, including the Old and the New testaments. It's written in clear simple language and covers just about everything you can think of, including some things you wouldn't think of. If anything, I'd like to see the book expanded. Asimoz skips over some chapters where I wish he had spent more time. And his traditional view of the bible seems outdated nowadays. But if you're looking for a place to get started, Azimov is a must."
4,"Not Dr. Asimov's usual subject, but excellent just the same",Dr. Asimov has written a highly readable and clear guide to the Old and New Testament. His style and prose help make the subject accessible to practically any age
1,Consult an expert,"Reading Azimov concerning the Bible is like reading Billy Crystal about brain surgery! If one want's good info, read something by a noted Scripture scholar - like Brown or Bruggermann or Frick."
4,An accomplished work by a well known athiest,"I love Asimov's writings. His Science Fiction has helped create the genre. His History works are always insightful.I also love the Bible, and knowing old Issac is an Athiest I bought this book with a degree of trepidation.My trepidation was unfounded. Asimov treats the Bible with respect and understanding. He recognises many of the Old Testament Prophecies about Jesus (another point that concerned me, knowing of Asimov's Jewish heritage).He puts the Bible into its wider historical perspective.This isn't the first book I will refer to to understand a part of the Bible, but it is one to which I will often refer."
4,The basics of bible scholarship,"Ok, he was not Frank Moore Cross or E.P. Sanders. He took for granted facts that are now widely questioned (like Solomons' Israel's great power and wealth, or the crowd demanding Jesus' crucfixion). But in this book he gives you the fundamental basis of knowledge for really placing biblical books and events in their historical contest. His comments are a rareexample of clear and unbiased historical analysis. Though dated, is still a good introduction to biblical lore."
4,great tour through the history of judaism and christianity,"over the past few years i've begun to critically evaluate my faith and position on christianity. as part of this ""quest"", i wanted to read a secular history of the bible to help me understand the historical context that the books of the bible were written in. this book fit the bill perfectly and was an interesting and entertaining read to boot. it took me a while to read (in small chunks), but i feel i have a much deeper understanding on the bible now.that said, asimov is an avowed atheist, and there is a clear bias against christianity. but that's fine- i don't mind having my beliefs challenged, and his points are food for thought.if i have any complaints, it's that asimov rarely cited his sources, and i would have liked to read some of those books as well."
5,Balanced commentary by a reverent skeptic,"Asimov's Commentary on the Bible is a thoughtful commentary from a brilliant mind. His stated goal is to improve the reader's understanding of the ancient world, placing the events of the Bible in their appropriate historical context. Asimov approaches the material objectively with reverence and magnanimity. The end result is a balanced, approachable work that will engage both believer and skeptic."
5,"Static-X is a good band, and they made a good CD!","I highly recommend you buy this CD! Is has hot songs like Push It, Bled for Days, and Wisconsin Death Trip. The extra track Down is a great song also! The band is good, and the songs are good. Get It!"
5,Must Buy,"This is a awesome CD. The lyrics I like do to the fact that it is ful of rage and anger, because that is one way I think you should let it out. Wayne Static has awesome vocals that add a slmming sound to the guitars and drums. Great CD which was suprisingly awesome!"
1,Boring!!!,"I'm sorry to be so negative, but this album is just dreadful. This isn't anything personal, because I have actually met the band briefly on their UK tour with System of a down and they seemed like nice guys, but I just have to say that I hate this album. The best description of this is like a half-hearted combination of White Zombie, Fear Factory and Ministry, without any of the good bits. This is just so unoriginal and predictable, every song is just lowest common denominator pounding metal with nothing interesting or redeeming whatsoever. Although there is a pretty good production job it doesn't hide the fact that every song sounds the same, that the lyrics mean nothing and that the whole album is a bone-headed neanderthal experience. For those who think bands like Coal Chamber and Mudvayne are cutting edge."
4,hell yeah,"This is the best debut disc since metallica's kill 'em all, static-X is defintely one of the best new bands out there,combined with a sweet a** live show this disc rocks from first note to last highly recommended."
5,The Best Band ive Heard In a Long Time,"Static-x Has To be one of the greatest bands ive ever heard, when i went to see them at ozzfest i didnt know what to expect when it came to seeing them live, boy was i amazed, they put on a killer show, after that i got to meet them! they are one of the best bands around with the nicest people in it, i recoment Wisconcin Death Trip to anyone and everyone, BUY THIS CD OR WAYNE WILL EAT YOU!"
3,What the?!,"Ok, first of all, these guys sound like White Zombie/Rob Zombie mixed with Coal Chamber and System Of A Down. Now, SOAD is original, but i don't like them that much. Coal Chamber is original and they rock. But these guys aren't original. Save your money for a band with their own style, not some copycat band. (Including Alice in Chains ripoffs Godsmack and Staind. I highly recommend avoiding those CD's) If you really like any of the other bands I mentioned, go ahead and get the CD. But if you like original high quality music, forget it. Save the cash."
4,wow,"wow. this is truly amazing. by far the best metal band to hit the scene since last summer when system of a down landed (and that includes releases by staind, spineshank, and orgy). this album can, at its best, be compared to the best of zombie's stuff, with some SOAD thrown in, and some neat disco beats. simply stunning. buy this cd."
2,Every song sounds the same,"I have listened to this cd and basically every song sounds the same. i think that they should start to try new things and not just have that heavy punk sound to every song. after listening to about 2 of there songs, i started to get tired of there sound."
2,Hilariously simplistic!,"If amateurish songwriting and two-note riffs are your thing, look no further than this. I give it 2 stars because some half-decent moments do pop up. Get a Fear Factory or Meshuggah record instead."
3,good effort,"this cd is awesome when you get, it's hard and heavy. however, the more you listen to it the more and more boring it gets. the music is great even though it is pretty basic, but after a few listens, the lyrics get annoying from all the repition. it is a good cd for someone to buy if it were their first hard rock album."
3,Have lyrics apply here,The guitar rocks----Ill give you that---but VERY limited on lyrics--way too repetitive. Youll enjoy this cd for a week or two-then never listen to it again.
4,its a high energy raw powered get pumped about cd,I walked into to ozzfest'99 at the gorge in washington and I was blew away ozzy put static-x on the mainstage for this one and they showed why they were worthy one of the best bands ive ever saw in concert a week later i got the cd it may not be as great as live but its just as raw an powerful a must for a metal cd collector if u like metal or techno or just electrifying sounds this cd is for u
4,"Good, but not exellent","This CD actually has some of my favorite songs of all time on here. Bled For Days, Push it, Love Dump, and Wisconsin Death Trip. I don't have much to say for this CD but I recommend you to get Machine first before you get this one. What I've heard of Machine, that one is far better than this one! A good CD thought with great guitars and drums. The vocals are okay but they could have been better. Worth 9 bucks at tops for me. But a okayish CD."
3,V.I.P. in the Disco,"This band from Cali rock dance music samples under layers of electric guitar and think it's cool, even though these songs have numbskulled lyrics I think that's part of the fun. This ""evil disco"" is a good change of pace from hiphop beats that I usually get into."
4,Ear-catching rock!,"As a band I have heard since its time of ""Push It"", this band seems promising. I have found it has hard rock written all over (by today's standards). Although it lags in some songs (::cough cough:: ""December""), it has great tunes like ""Love Dump"", ""Bled For Days"", and ""I'm With Stupid"". So i recommend this to all rock fans. And now I am going to sit back, and listen to some more Static-X."
4,"No great songs, all a little bland","I bought this Cd cause I heard it was great hard-core.I guess hard-core doesn't excite me like it used to. I still like bands like KORN and Rob/White Zombie and love P.O.D., Nonpoint, Deftones, and Taproot. This Cd is different though. None of the songs really excite me. There are some bands like this that just don't excite me any more. Maybe I am liking softer stuff, but I recommend that even if you love hard music, think twice about this Cd, cause it isn't all that great. My review used to end here (with only 2 stars), but I decided to add some. This Cd grows on you the more you listen. If you can relate to liking the band that I have talked about above, give this Cd a try. You may agree with my above statments, but I give this band a lot more credit for this Cd nowadays. I didn't like their new one though."
4,PUSH IT AGAIN,i just saw them yesterday with PM5K in NYC... my neck still hurts from all the head banging... had the album for a while now... if u r a metal fan looking for something different u should get this. GOT TO LOVE THE HAIR. static-X r a cool band with cool sound. keep it simple STATIC. out.
5,Awesome Album,"If your new to Static X, I recommend getting this cd. I love every song on it, listen to it all the time. This is by far my favorite album from Static X."
3,Decent,This cd starts off strong and then just falls apart. Perhaps their next offering will be more focused.
2,Gets VERY annoying after a while,"Well, I saw the Push It video before I heard the song and the song was actually pretty good. Then I got the Bride of Chucky soundtrack and Bled for Days was on it. Once again I was impressed. I went over to my local music store and picked it up. I put in the car and started listening to it. After 2 or 3 songs I had to turn it off. Talk about repetitive! The songs are just too much like each other. The guy can't really sing and there isn't anything at all to the songs. It would be best to borrow it from someone and just dub it. No wonder it was on sale for $6.97. I am not even sure it was worth that much."
3,I didn't buy it....,"but I just simply used one of those cool in-store listening station things that are avalible to see if you enjoy the songs BEFORE you buy them.I only heard about 15 seconds of each song, but it wasn't very good. Even the title of this cd is one of those songs that were the least bit enjoyable. This band's songs don't sound right to me either. It's like they're trying to confuse you in some way. There are better things to listen to if you agree with me. Most heavy metal bands like this one just try to make a bunch of annoying sounds with weird instruments sound like a nice song. Nowadays, the best thing to do if you're not sure if you want to buy a cd because you want to hear it first, then it IS a good thing these in-store listening stations exist."
5,Hardest album I own,"I say this because it's true. Static-X is VERY hard, and sometimes this can just cut into your brain and make you go crazy. But, unlike such super-hard groups such as Slipknot, this album doesn't give you the migraine of a lifetime. Each song has a message, and it's not about killing your friends or parents. Actually, I don't believe that they tell you to do ANYTHING in this album, Wayne just wrote some songs out and they put some cool music to them. I like this cd so much, I even took the time to figure out (with the help of the cd cover with the words in it) the lyrics to the songs AND be able to sing along with Wayne. Ken lays down some killer drum beats in some of the songs. Altogether, this album is great. Although some of the later songs seem a little like the songs at the beginning in sound, they are totally different in substance."
5,Next up and comming band!!!,"Wisconsin Death Trip is an unbelievably good album. Static-X has a techno-grind sound similar to White Zombie. If you are into loud, ear catching beats...buy Wisconsin Death Trip. Get up on this Wisconsin Death Trip! GO!"
2,Slick but mechanical,"The first song off this album blew me away..""push it"" sounds like Prong covering Helmet's ""bad mood"". Nice. The rest of the album though - White Zombie b-sides. Lazy comparison I know. Give it a listen before you consider a purchase. It's not bad, but it's nothing special either."
4,"band of the last 10,000 years","Static X's new album is like a hard core WhiteZombie. They sing of violence in a death metal way.Their best song is ""Push It."" If you like death punkthen you will like this album"
1,Snap into a slim jim,"After hearing the song ""Push it"" I thought Static X sounds like a pretty good new band, with a sound kind of like Rob Zombie's solo LP. After listening to W.D.T. at my friend's house I realized every song has only one riff played over and over. The lyrics are just plain dumb. If you want to hear some real hard core music try Acid Bath or Clutch. At least those two bands have talent and are original."
5,Superb Metal/Thrash/Techno mix of pounding rock! 10 Stars!,"After Machine, could they possibly get better? The answer is YES. Without loosing any of the uniquely raw edge that their first CD gave us, Static-X takes a step forward in what rock fans have been waiting a long time for. The unique blend of metal, thrash, techno, and Wayne's guttural screaming vocals push this band to the top of my listening list. Take System of a Down and blend them with Rob Zombie's dance beats, add Wayne Static and there you go! Fast drums, deep beats, the best growling screams in rock today, electronic riffs, driving guitars; Static-X had made it. Favorites? `Bled For Days', `Love Dump' (you gotta love the lyrics on this one!), `I'm With Stupid', and `Sweat Of The Bud'. As with Machine, Wisconsin Death Trip finishes off the CD with a machine-like sound in December, mellow and ethereal. Don't miss this CD, don't miss any of their CD's!"
3,Mediocre,"This album has some good songs like ""bled for days"", ""push it"", ""im with stupid"", and ""love dump. This album gets boring after a while though and I dont listen to it that much anymore. ""Bled for days"" is an excellent song though I remember hearing it in the movie BRIDE OF CHUCKY and I remember moshing to that song when I saw them live. Machine is a far superior album to this but if you want to buy it you probably will anyways just thought I'd let you know it is nothing special, it is not awful either, though."
5,Wisconson Death Trip is the best album ever,"I encourage everyone to buy this album, it is the best. I promise nobody will be dissapointed by it. STATIC-X ROCKS"
2,THIS CD SUCKS YOUY IN AT FIRST... BUT EVRYTHING AFTER TRAK 2,"LIKE I SAID, WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS CD,... I WAS LIKE... MAN THIS IS KILLER,... BUTA FTER A FEW LISTENS,... IT GETS OLD... AND EVERYTHING AFTER TRAK 2 IS 2/3RDS TECHNO,... IT GETS OLD, BUT ""PUSH IT"", AND ""IM WITH STUPID"" ROCK."
1,"If this guy didnt have funny hair, Static-X would be nothing","In all of this idiotic ''new-metal'' trend everyone loves, I have never heard anything as dumb as this. Static-X is like a metal version of Bob Saget. The guitars are dumb and simple. The drums sound like someone tapping on a table. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON WAYNE! The worst vocalist I have heard since the Bon Jovi scare of 88. Wisconsin Death Trip is a waste of your time, a waste of your money, and a waste of electricty/battery power. A horrible buy."
2,A Bit Of A Disappointment,"I heard a song called ""Push It"" on MTV by this band Static-X. I loved it. I bought the CD the next day. I admit that they have talent, but most of the songs are dull. The first line of ""Bled For Days"" perfectly describes it: ""Meaningless, it's meaningless."" A few rockers, but mostly boring industrial metal. If you like bands like KoRn and Slipknot for their energy, you probably won't like this band because they don't seem to have much."
4,Really good Indus-metal Band,"This is not a nu-metal crap album. Even if it's cool to get this one, because of radio or MTV or whatever, this CD is really good. I listen to a lot of Industrial-metal bands, I mean bands like Ministry, Godflesh, Prong, White zombie, Pitch Shifter (pre-'dot com' album), and not techno-pop combos like Dope, Orgy, Pitchshifter (post-'dot com' album) or Powerman 5000 (far better before their last album). And I must admit that this one is not bad at all, on the contrary. This remind me a lot of what did Prong (what a fantastic band), mixed with White Zombie ('Astro Creep'-era). It's not too catchy, and the voice can be really aggressive, I like it a lot. It's not on the same level as some masters as Godflesh or Ministry, but for a first shot... impressive. I hope only that they won't turn to more mainstream and less original, as bands like Fear Factory (I'm sad) or Pitch Shifter (it's a shame to wayste such a talent)."
5,motion...do ya feel tha motion,"This album rules! Even though bands like KoRn and Limp Bizkit are my two favorite bands, I tend to like bands who don't get much air-play on MTV. I'm going to see them live on the 11th with Powerman 5000, and I know it is going to rule. Static-X's Wisconsin Death Trip is one of the ten CDs that I take everywhere. I hope this band goes far. The best five songs on the CD (in this order) is ""Push It"", ""I'm With Stupid"", ""Wisconsin Death Trip"", ""Bled for Days"", and ""Love Dump."" Sure the lead ""singer"" Wyane Static yells, but that just makes the album more heavy. The only draw back (and this isn't much of one) is that it usually takes about two minutes for Wyane Static to start singing, but if you know how to rew-wind on the CD player, you'll be just fine! Get the CD! While you are at it, get Powerman 5000 and Slipknot CDs."
5,"Static-X, it's been a long time coming!","It has taken too long for someone to finally wake up and realize that this band is worth it. The long-awaited release of ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" has made Static-X fans excited nationwide. This CD is a beautiful mix of loud, low, heavy guitar riffs and screaming vocals from leadman Wayne. The pounding drum sounds from skinman Ken Jay help to plant you firmly in your seat while Tony, on the bass, Koichi and Wayne, on the guitars, grind away at your spine. To all those heavy rockers out there, this is one CD you had better get your hands and ears on. You might want to check them out on this summers Ozzfest tour also!"
5,STATIC-X ROCKS !!! YOU HAVE TO FEEL THE DEATH TRIP !!!,"This album is the greatest release of the year in my book. I had owned Push It and Bled For Days before the album was released. Those two songs were totally unbelievable. NOW... I have a whole album to drool over !! The beats are awesome, the guitars are wailing, and the vocals are monstrous !! GET THIS ALBUM NOW !!! NOW !!! GO !!"
5,one of the best bands at ozzfest!,iv liked these guys fer a long time and never brought my self to buying the CD but since i saw them at ozzfest iv wanted to get their CD but have had no time when the stores are open. im determined to get it!
2,not as good as i wanted it to be,I saw staic-x open up for fear factory a while back. they were pretty good i met the singer and bhought a 3-song demo itwas great. I bhought the alblum a couple of moths after it was released and i was disapointed there were only about 4 good songs and two were on the demo.
3,Enjoyable,"It's not highly original or inventive, and it's not mindblowing or anything. But it's fun, and I like it. It's full of agression and hard-driving riffs and all the other things that a metal fan would want. Some may say it's boring, or trendy, or something like that.. but I say it's good metal entertainment that is worth the occasional listen."
1,boring and stupid,"I bought this cd a few years ago thinking that ""push it"" was a good song. That was it rest of the cd goes to [junk]. Overrated if you ask me."
1,REPETATIVE AND BORING,"I BOUGHT THIS CD AFTER HEARING THE END OF ONE OF THEIR SONGS ON THE RADIO, WHICH SOUNDED COOL, AND AFTER HAVING A FRIEND RECOMMEND IT. BIG MISTAKE. IF YOU JUST LISTEN TO LITTLE BITS AND PIECES IT IS OK. BUT AFTER LISTENING TO THE WHOLE THING I REALIZED HOW REPETATIVE AND BORING THIS BAND IS. EACH SONG SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAME. THEY START OFF COOL BUT THEN JUST REPEAT THE SAME GUITAR RIFFS OVER AND OVER AND THE SAME COUPLE LINES OF LYRICS OVER AND OVER. TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE WHOLE CD NEARLY DROVE ME INSANE BUT I KEPT HOPING IT WOULD GET BETTER. IT DIDN'T."
1,What is this?,"Two Words: Coal Chamber. Come on people, this group is just trying to be like coal chamber. for example, take push it and listen to loco by coal chamber, and you get almost the exact melody. Please, don't waste your money on this, go buy coal chamber's first cd."
3,Static X - Static makes the band,"Wisconsin Death Trip is a strange album. You have the songs that sound like they should go on the radio because they're so good, then you have the songs that seem to put you in a trance.Wayne Static's voice is so strangely gravelly yet chaotic that it works. The music is driving sometimes, and sometimes it almost seems cynically playful. The lyrics are both angry and cynically funny.""Push It"", ""I'm With Stupid"", and ""Bled for Days"" are really standout songs which should be put on the radio. The other songs tend to be more towards the fill-in side for the record, though."
5,AWESOME BAND....NOT FOR THE SQUIMISH,"STATIC-X IS SIMPLY AWESOME, THEIR ELECTRONIC GENIUS'S..SONGS LIKE PUSH IT MAKE ME WANNA START A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE, IT GETS ME SO PUMPED..CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT...ITS MAD GOOD..PEACE! OH YEAH JUST TO LET EVERYONE KNOW..STATIC-X HAS BEEN KEEPING DISCO EVIL SINCE 1996...OK PEACE!"
1,hold lose,"The hanger can't hold the shower head tightly.So over time the shower head would ""slip"" away from this holder and fall off.not recommend"
3,OK - but lots of mistakes,"The book was OK - but I would suggest Network+ Training Guide by Drew Bird and Mike Harwood if you want to pass the test (although the CD practice test is useless and nothing but a plug to buy more material from PrepLogic). Lots of mistakes in Groth's book and even mistakes in his CD-ROM practice test material (RAID 0 doesn't disk strip?). I even attempted to reach him on the internet to point out his mistakes, but no luck. I am not impressed with Sybex. If this is the best they can do, I'll definitely not use them for my MCSA material."
4,Excellent Network+ core book,"Network+ Study Guide assisted me in passing Network+ with a score of 833/900. This book is strong in NT/2000 content, but lacking in Netware, Appletalk and Unix content. That said, the majority of the Network+ exam is devoted to NT/2000; nonetheless the Network+ tests are randomly generated and you may luck out with a Netware-heavy exam. Some sections contained errors in the review questions which were duplicated on the CD-ROM. However, careful readers will note the errors and learn from them. I recommend this book as a primary Network+ resource, and supplementing it with secondary materials."
4,Excellent book for the exam,"I studied almost exclusively from this book for the exam, and passed with flying colors. The practice questions are almost word for word the ones encountered on the Exam. I looked at a couple other books, and they were way off of the material needed for the exam.It would be 5 stars, but the OSI model isn't explained as clearly as it could have been. I actually had to read a chapter from another book to get a solid understanding of the model.Having said that, if you know the material covered in this book, and the material in the practice exams, you should be able to pass the exam."
2,Lacking Real Word Info,"This is a good book if you are only looking to take an exam. Like many other books that promote paper certs, this book provides just enough detail. God forbid, it goes a step further and provides real world information and detail. If your looking for the paper read this book. If you are looking for something with some real world information and correct spelling, look for something else. Lots of typos and mistakes in this book."
2,This book is riddled with errors,"David Groth's ""Network + Study Guide"" is plagued with typos, omissions, and errors. Most disturbing are the numerous technical content mistakes. In many cases, these mistakes serve to further confuse a reader who is already struggling to grasp the nuances of Networking. Note: many of the errors are found in the Chapter Review Questions, and companion CD's Practice Exams. Clearly, no one at Sybex bothered to proofread this book's technical content before release.On the positive side, the book is well illustrated. There are many usefully pictures, graphs, and diagrams. The content of the book does closely mirror the content of the Network + exam (I just took the exam today).So, if you can get through the book without pulling your hair out, you will probably pass the exam. But make it easier on yourself and find another Network + study guide."
2,Not very good.,"This book was my only preperation for the exam along with very little hands on experience. I managed to pass the exam, but this book did not help that much. The only good part of the book is the chapter on TCP/IP utilities. The rest of the book is nothing more than a breif overview of the exam objectives. There has to be a better book out there that goes into more detail of network topologies especially token ring. The book never touched on ISDN but my exam had a lot of ISDN questions. I do not recommend this book as your ptimary source of information. It is fine for little details and overviews."
2,Yet another dismal failure from Groth & Sybex,"I don't even know who to blame at this point: the author or the technical editors. NUMEROUS CONTENT MISTAKES in this text. And as usual, they did NOT return any of my emails when I pointed out their typically erroneous information [see my review of their i-Net+ book]. I HIGHLY recommend that newbies use the EXAM CRAM 2 book instead."
4,Good enough to pass the exam.,"And may be to learn a thing or two about computer networking. If you are ready to take it to the next level and get Cisco certified, check out ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton. Unless you want to take the Microsoft Road..."
2,Lacking detail,"I found this book to valuable in the sense of providing detail to pass the exam, but yet missing the points on some very fundamental, real world issues. Use this book if you want to pass the exam for the paper value. Use other books if you really want to learn about networking."
2,Review correction,"Webmaster: Thank you for posting my review of the Network+ Study Guide this week. I did notice one typo in the review. Please replace ""There are many usefully pictures, graphs. . ."" with ""There are many useful pictures, graphs. . ."".Thanks,Kenneth Levesque"
5,Dorothy,"Love the history content of the book and writing style of the authors. The style of the authors is such, that you think you are watching a movie as you read it. This book is especially good because Ben Franklin was such an amazing man. Recommend this book for teens and adults to read. Be warned though, once you start this book you won't be able to put it down til you finish it."
4,Very cushy...love them,"I am a runner who needs the support. There is nothing better than running with them. Previous to them, I had shin splints and calf cramps that would put me on the ground. Now, I am cramp free and shin splint free!!"
5,"Getting ""The Edge"" with the Weiders","I'm 47 years old, and used to live in the gym. Then laid off for almost three years. I started back again with a personal trainer, but wasn't satisfied. I've read all the magazine articles - but getting the right, customized program can be very daunting.""The Edge"" is a practical guide, with proven, tailorable programs and clear explanations of exercizes, frequency, and type of result that can be expected. It also has a very clear nutritional program, and an EXCELLENT, and thoroughly up-to-date section on food supplements.Whether you're 20 or 50; Whether want to just ""tone up"", get ready for sports competition, or body build, ""The Edge"" has a program for you.I highly recommend it.AC, Stamford, CT."
4,A good mix of the basics with some important details,"This is one of the best books on fitness that I have read. Its definitely better than a lot of the books on the market. The book would be helpful to beginners, as well as those who have a long history of working out.The style of the book is written somewhat as a weightlifting by dummies approach, except in a much more professional way. Specifically, the authors stick to general issues in the text, which they then support with more complex details, such as issues relating to physiology, in grey boxes.For beginners, the detailed workout schedule may prove helpful. For advanced lifters, the discussions on different muscle groups (and how to improve muscle in those groups) is enlightening.The section on nutrition is very detailed and, quite frankly, a bit long. It was the only part of the book that I viewed as somewhat weak (they tried to outline diets and dietary supplements, which is a very difficult thing to do)."
4,The Edge by Weider et al.,"This is an excellent work. It covers the basic weight trainingexercises in the gym together with the nutritional dimensioninvolved in developing the body . For instance, the authordiscusses alkalinizers to maintain pH/ (acid/base) balance.In addition, he reviews the role of bioflavinoids, biotin,bromelain (digestion) and Co Q 10-antioxidants. He describespertinent exercises for the head/neck (stretches), lower back(extensions), mid-section (incline-sit-ups), bench press forthe chest and lateral pull-downs for the upper back. Herecommends slow inducers for insulin production; such as,soy protein, peanuts, lentils, apples, yogurt and skim milk.The work is a fairly complete rendition for maintaininggood health and muscle tone. This program may be best donewith the assistance of a personal trainer."
5,Bushwharckers,A very good book---makes you feel as if you in the mountainsduring those times. I would recommend this book to anyone thats lovesgood mountain air END
5,Riveting !!,"Being born, raised, and still living in the area covered by this text, I could not put it down once started. This work pulls together all the nasty and sometimes horrifying conflicts that took place during the war, including murders between family members. I highly recommend reading Bushwhackers. The author flavors the actual history with a buttery-smooth writing style.William ""Bo"" Cash, Morganton NC"
1,I am disappointed,"The product size was decieving. I purchassed this product thinking I could store clothing in this storage bins. I was surprised to see I could use this to store screws, nails nuts andd other small knick knacks."
5,very good book for self-study,"Recently, I had to learn set theory for my current work (automated reasoning and expert systems). This book proved to be an excellent supplement for learning set theory; which I then used to learn formal logic, resolution, etc.Very well written and with good examples and exercises."
3,Celtic Treasure,"Sorry. The music is just ok. I'll give it to Goodwill, maybe someone else will enjoy it."
1,they don't last,"I have 2 of these lights, neither work any more. Both stopped working within a year of purchase. It starts with one of the 3 LED bulbs not working any more and eventulay the other 2 follow. I didn't mind that they gave off minimal light, it worked for what I wanted, but I did want them to last more than a year."
2,Didn't Survive the Winter,"I have several solar landscape items including walkway lights, stepping stones, deck rail lights, and motion sensor security flood lights. All survived the 2010 blizards except my two Malibu Solar Resin Rock Landscape lights. Neither work since the thaw."
4,Has worked great for years,We have had this light for 4 + years and have been very happy with it. Desert southwest US. Used in a dry spot in garden. Recently replaced stock batteries for the first time as unit seemed dim. Used rechargeable AA 1000mAH NiCd Batteries that we first charged in the home charger (BC-900). Blazing bright and remains that way until sun-up (10 hours).Would buy again.
2,disappointment,"solar panel on top at an angle leaning away from light, in order to get full sunlight you may not get to place the light where you want. Absolutely did not put out a 'flood' of light, only right in front, same amount as my pole solar lights, not a flood."
2,A problem with multichannel,"Great concert and very good sound... in stereo.For the multichannel, it's a stereo remix in 5 channels. It's a pity because the record session have been made in 2009 ! The 1st symphony record (summer 2009 too) is perfect so why this one is a remix ?Please EuroArts, improve it as you did for the second one."
5,"Please, reissue!!!","Recordings of Bartok's 6 string quartes were once featured in BBC3 Buliding a library, and as far as I recall, the best recommendation was Takacs DECCA recording which also won Gramophone Award. But I personally think Talich Qt as the best interpretor of the works. They play each piece with warm and more resonant sound, and more authority, while Takacs playing lacks unity as an ensemble, with every player trying to assert individuality. Talich's Complete Bartok String Quartets must be reissued!!!"
4,Good for the price!,I tried the rail out when it first arrived. Worked great and saved time focusing on the shot. Hard to beat for the price
5,One album I'll probably listen to forever,"I believe I've played this CD, on average, once each week since I first came upon it in Spring, 1999. Atypically, each piece on the album is thoroughly enjoyable, and every one seems better than the one before it. Well represented are works by David Lantz and Paul Speer, and by David Arkenstone. Usually I skip around when playing a CD; this is my one and only exception. And everyone asks for repeats of ""Behind the Waterfall""."
1,boring stuff,"I was hoping this would be the best of Narada's 1st decade... oh boy, was I disappointed! I'd say this is one of the worst compilations I've ever bought. This stuff is slow, boring, tuneless, etc. Want to torture someone, put on this CD. Yes, some people might like new agey muzak or elevator music or whatever this is. I sure dont; 1 star from me."
1,The Insider's Guide to 52 Homes in 52 Weeks: Acquire Your Real Estate Fortune Today,"Not worth the time nor money. This book promotes the idea of buying real estate through WE BUY HOUSES signs and through ads in newspapers. Ideal for groups of investors who have plenty of time, capital and OPM to invest around the country."
4,Only for the truly devoted,"Doolf is the King of real estate investing as he is fully focused on one sector, he does not try to straddle the various areas which he refers to as trading.If you are serious about growing a real estate portfolio as a long term investment then Doolf, through his various books, is your ideal partner/coach/mentor, with the 52 Homes in 52 Weeks he proves to you that with focus and diligence you can become a real estate mogul in just 1 year.The main lesson I took away after reading this book is that even as a buyer you can be proactive in your search, advertising does pay for both sellers and buyers."
2,fun read,Fun but not much substance. Got lucky the real estate market didn't turn on them or they would have been up the creek.
5,very useful even for the non vedic astrologers,"I've always been interested in the nakshatras, used in vedic astrology (sidereal zodiac). They are simple to calculate (planetary degree in the tropical zodiac minus 23), can be used by non vedic astrologers too and they give some information you cannot find somewhere else. The author explains all moon mansions in detail in separate chapters. Every chapter ends with a short overview and gives some interpretations when the ascendant, the sun or moon is found in the mentioned nakshatra. He even gives some career interests and health issues related to the nakshatras. But what I find most interesting is the chapter about relationship compatibility in which Dennis Harness explains the kuta point system and some other important factors that should be analyzed for relationship compatibility. This was new stuff to me and I'm very glad the author incorporated this in his book. Well-well-very well-done !"
1,Waste of Printing paper,If you are new to the subject it will leaveyou groping the dark. If you already know somethingabout nakshatras it will bore you to death.The 27 nakshatras ( a vast topic) have been coveredin 150 odd pages of disconnected gibberish.A total disgrace. No wonder Vedic astrology can't geta proper foothold in the west.

4,Their 2nd best album?,"A great cd from an absolutely great band.Standouts for me are A Sentimental Song, and the back to back ""Tear for Tear"" and ""About Love"".I personally like ""Speckled Bird"" (the mass produced version of ""Kissers and Killers"") better, but Circle Slide can definitely be in the argument for their best work and that's saying a lot."
1,Doesn't give good value for the money,"We ordered two of these for christmas gifts and when we got them we turned around and sent them right back. Inside the vinyl holder was a very small pack of materials, it just looked like very little for [the money]. We didn't open the small package of materials because we knew it was going back. When we spend [money] on a gift it has got to be more substantial than this."
1,very disappointed,"I bought this kit because i love to do paper crafts, but when i opened it I was very disappointed, it was not what i expected for the money i paid. The cut and color masks are a little scary for smaller children, there is only 2 in the package that is acceptable for young children the rest are scary dinosaur faces. I was expecting cute animal faces. I did get glue and scissors in the package which isn't stated in the picture and description. Overall the purchase was a big disappointment, I won't be purchasing it again."
5,one of the best peek-a-block toys!,"We own EVERY peek-a-block toy under the sun... Our sons LOVE trucks (11 month olds) and our daughter LOVES the blocks (24 month old)This trunk just HAS to be loved. Its a dump truck, and it dumps out the blocks easily. Its very durable, well it holds up to constant abuse and is always a favorite!The truck plays music when rolled, or when a peek-a-block is placed into the wheels or the drivers seat. The peek-a-blocks that come with the set are all adorable and have to do with construction--a driver block that has a rolling ball inside (twirls around)-a block with a traffic sign inside (twirls around)-a block with sand inside (rattles around)-a block with rocks inside (rattles around)-a block with traffic cones inside (rattles around)They are all cute and fun as rattles for my 11 month old twins. My daughter LOVES ""peeking"" (pun intended) inside and identifying what they are...This toy is more than just a truck, its THE truck to have for any baby/toddler"
4,Dump away!,"They play with it quite a bit but the dumper part comes off easily. I don't find it particularly educational, they just push it around and listen to the sounds and music."
5,wonderful toy truck!,"My little one loves this truck. He plays with the truck and the blocks often during the day, as he gets older and can actually put the blocks into the truck wheels and into the dump part of the truck it will be like a new toy all over again. Very good value, very sturdy fun toy. I would suggest this truck for anyone wih a toddler."
3,dump truck,The blue dump part doesnt stay on. :( My son has been able to pull it off so much that it wont even stay put. It falls off. He has owned it about a month.Other than that i like it. He has a lot of fun with it and has figured out how to put the blocks in the wheels and the front.
5,I LOVE THIS TOY! GREAT FOR ALL AGES!,"This toy was bought for my 10 month old son and he LOVES this toy! My 4 year old son, 12 year old Daughter, and my 30 something husband also LOVE this toy as well as the cool blocks that come with it and the others that you can get separately. We also have the Giraff and will be getting the wagon too! This is one cool toy! I see lots of fun years ahead with these toys! It's great for ALL ages!"
3,It's Okay,"I have a 14 month old, we gave this to him when he was 6 months old. It's never sparked a lot of interest. The ""bed"" of the truck came off and pretty much stays off. It's loud and it doesn't do much for him. It's one of the few toys that doesn't catch his interest."
5,The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor,"Very simply put - My favorite author's best story ever! Without even putting this book down I turned from the last page to the first to reread it. I have read it aloud to more than one lover. Truly a story to be shared. As a devotee and companion of Barth for thirty years I often been drawn into his layered approach to story telling, but this story of stories within stories is definitely the most readable; jumping seamlessly from one era and character set to another."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"I am maniacal about finishing books, but I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. I found it to be full of sexist male fantasies and macho expression. I do NOT think this book can be construed as feminist. The author's pretension and satisfaction with himself showed through brilliantly in his writing. I have found (and the other reviews support this) that mostly men like this book. All of the women I have talked to about it disliked it strongly, if they even finished it. I found it tedious, and too self-satisfied to tolerate."
1,Piece Of Garbage!,Fly threw rings and pick up cars...this game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anus.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible, too rough and generic. To make matters worse, they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast. Basicly, it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that, this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it."
1,Superman super-blows,"I don't understand. How hard is it to make a Superman game? This game could have been so much more. For one, the control is pathetic. Second, Superman flying through rings? Third, there are so many glitches in this game that at times, I thought that I was using my X-ray vision. In actuality, the wall somehow disappeared due to an apparent glitch. And fourth, Superman flying through RINGS! The character you control might look like the big 'S', but he ain't no Superman. I mean, I can understand how in the game, he might need a health bar, but I would have like for him to at least take a few hits without dying. And what's with the fog? Why's he in a virtual world? Why not a real one? Why does he fly so damn slow? Argh! There are so many problems with this game, I can't finish this review. I just hope that SOMEONE can revive the Superman license by making at least a somewhat fun game."
1,Not worth it,"All I have to say is this game is the worst I've EVER played.This is including games for nes, snes, genesis, and game boy. Theplot is horrible, the introduction is tedious, and the game play is boring. When I played this game I spent all my time trying to figure out what I was supposed to do. It is very weak and the controls are awkward to boot. Don't even waste your time looking at the cover. (It really doesn't deserve one star, but...) END"
1,Good for only one reason: To show people how not to make a video game,"The awfulness of this game is legendary. It's literally right up there with the likes of E.T. for the Atari 2600. The controls are broken, the textures and characters are blocky and ugly as all hell, the music is horrible, the story is dumb, and the only objective in the game is for Superman to fly through rings. The only thing this game is good for is a good laugh. It also shows current game developers what not to make. This game is so bad that even if John William's music was in the game, it would still suck."
1,YOU'LL BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY.....this garbage into the stores without being sued.,"DAHAHAHAHAHAHADAHAHAHAHAHADAHAHA!!!!!What a game! Is this bootlegged or what?! How to kill Superman. By a nameless 13 year old..a. kryptoniteb. infinite of crisis series.Try getting past those pages without crying.c.MAKE HIM PLAY THIS GAME!Its like an unfinished book report assignment.Oh sure you can write a report on a book you've rad before,but that's school. THIS IS A GAME.I give it 2 stars for fun because it's hilarious looking at this sloppy game. Im beat.Ill go read a comic book.HAHAHA"
1,Not Heaven............,"If you die and go to the underworld, it is supposed to be filled with the things you hate, right? Well, my cursed underworld would be a small, stinky room, with N' Sync playing, a small TV with only 1 game. And what would this game be? If you didn't already know, I'll tell you. Superman 64, in my opinion the worst game ever, would be playing. The thing is, a blank screen is just as fun as has a more pleasent sound and plot than this game, electronic, err..... thing. Stay away unless you are being paid to play it... and maybe not even then..."
1,This games [is bad]!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME!If you won't take my word that it [is bad], try renting it!They probably took 15 seconds to make it! It has many errors, and is next to impossible to move superman!Please, take my word for it, or rent it before you get it, because it really sucks."
1,"Who, in their right mind, would buy this game?","This is probably the worst game ever made for the N64. Notonly are the graphics sloppy, it also has very poor game play. Thisgame will bore you to death...LITERALLY! Can you give a game a -1? Trust me when I say this. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,I AGREE 1 STAR IS WAY TO GENEROUS FOR THIS GAME!,This game is the one of the appsolute worst games i have ever played it not only is dull and boring but the controls are awkward and unresponsive. The game play was also bad it just wasn't fun to play it. Flying through rings just isn't fun and there wasn't enough action either. The company who made this made a really bad game they shouldn't even have alowed this game on N64. The superman logo should be ashamed at putting out such a bad game with the superman logo on it.
1,I'm glad I did not buy this,"This has to be the WORST game for Nintendo 64 I have seen in a LONG time. You can hardly even play it because the controls are so horrible and it's just plain BORING. When I saw this at Blockbuster I thought it would be really fun to play. When I actually started playing it, I put the controller down after 10 minutes of trying to make Superman do much of anything at all and I shut off the system. I'm glad I wasted $5 intead of [the full price] on this game."
1,Worst Game Ever,"When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited, then they delayed the release date, which usually means the game is going under even more improvements. When I bought Superman I sped all the way home, turned off my phone and sat in my chair. To my suprise, this game is not worth the plastic it's made of. I don't even have one good thing to say about it. I was extremely disappointed. Superman used to be cool."
1,stuper man,"its vary stupid,the controls are ,well it seems that you can even control the arm""the arm waving blunder""stuperman.punching, do you even punch?if super man punched this hard in the comic lex luther would rule the world!graphics? hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd."
1,THE WOST GAME EVER MADE FOR ANY GAME SYSTEM!,"Simply put, the worst game ever made, for any game system! Horrible grafix, horrible music, very, very, very stupid storyline. if you play this ""game"" you will be wasting your life away. The only this worse then playing this, is dying! DONT BUY AT ANY COST! Not worth 0.01"
4,Superman Rocks!,"This game rules! Many people have negative feelings about this super-size game, but I happen to like it very much. Except for the little bugs and glitches of this game, it is truly an awesome game. It gives you the feeling that you truly are the Man of Steel, and you get to use most of his powers. I can honestly tell you that this is a great game. It is way better than previous games such as Super Mario 64 and Mario Party. One of the biggest problems of this game is that you can't travel everywhere in Metropolis and it is very foggy, so you can't get that good of a view when you're flying. This game rules. Buy it or don't buy it, it's your choice. But you'll be missing out on and adventure of a lifetime!"
1,"Oh my god, How do I give this 0 stars?","Ugh, most pathetic game of the year. And I thought it would be cool since blockbuster has about 2 million copies of it on their shelves. Titus wins the worst game of the year on this one. Superman was not meant to fly around in a long series of rings. Rings that if you miss you have to start over. Ugh, this is bad. Only Xena 64 is worse"
1,THE WORST N64 GAME OF ALL TIME!!!,"This game is one the worst N64 game of all time and one the second worst game of all time besides E.T. for Atari 2600.This game is so bad. It makes you want to kill yourself with your N64 Controller and your Super Gamer Fist.Imagine Superman was playing his own game for N64 and start crying like a baby!The controller is bad.The Gameplay is bad.The Graphics is bad.The Music is bad.Even the ending sucks where the game said ""Congratulations! You got your friends out of this Virtual World. But in the real world. Lex is still there"". Sorry, I have to spoiler the ending to warn you this ending sucks.Anyway, this game SUCKS!!!I'll give Superman 64 a 1/10. F-I'm sorry, I can't go lower then 1. You know what? This is my review. I can do whatever I want.I'll give Superman 64 a -64/10. Super FStay away from this game.If your AVGN Fan. Then keep this game and get it signed by James Rolfe as AVGN himself."
1,Where is he when we need him. . .,"There has never been, nor will there ever be, a more hidiously despicable, horrid, lousy excuse for a game. My view of Titus Soft. cannot be mentioned in mixed company. This was obviously made on a deadline, but how short was it? 5 minutes? I know people who could make a better game than this in that time! I wish Superman was real. Only HE could cure this injustice! No Stars! Not for you Titus!"
1,The Man of Steel is kind of weak,"I would strongly recomend that no one buy this game. The fact that it is boring almost outshadows how poorly designed it is. If you feel you must control the Man of Steel, rent it first."
1,Words cannot describe...,"I made the mistake of buying this game when it first came out and did not bother to rent it because I was a superman fan and the game looked fun on the package(of course). Not only were the graphics hidious, the music sounded like a funeral parlor, your tasks is to fly through circles and stop a car from crashing in a very limited time.It's boring! But being the person I am, I quit playing and played it again several hours later hoping that maybe I didn't give a fair chance. Hah! I felt like I was being punished for murder or something. All I can say is THIS IS THE WORST GAME IN HISTORY! Don't even let your enemy borrow it ...but then again, let them borrow it!"
1,One star is way too generous!,"When I first played this game, one word came to mind: wow! Never have I played a game so incredibly, mind-numbingly bad; I couldn't help but keep playing. The story is a joke, the graphics are blurry and look like something the Atari 2600 could've handled, controls are unresponsive, and the levels are the worst that you could imagine. Flying through ring after ring over and over is about the least enjoyable idea for a game ever. If you love to waste money then I wholly recommend this game. If I could have, I would've given this game half or even a third of a star. It's that bad. Scratch that; it's worse."
3,this game is O.K.,"I asked for this game for christmas because it looked cool and I like superman, but when I finally got it and played it, I realized that it was only so-so. I hated constantly flying through rings and not getting any real action.The graphics were only just O.K., and the slow controller response time was very annoying. This game should definitely be redone so it is actually fun to play. I mean, I liked it a little bit, but it's just not the greatest game in the world."
2,Super Boring Man,"I rented superman thinking it would be a great game - I however got nowhere - all I did was run some mazes and fly around - I found no point to it - horrible save system as well - A game should catch your attention at first and this one did not - It may get to be a good game later on, but I never got through the tedious boring part to find anything fun."
1,superman 64,"The game was very difficult to play. I bought it for my kids the first day it came out because the commercials looked really neat. My kids played it for about 2 days and nobody has played it since. My husband and I tried to play it and couldn't get past the first couple screens. If you are going to buy it, I suggest you buy it used or on clearance, because it wasn't worth the money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This is without a doubt the worst game I have played. PERIOD. Flying through rings again and again to reach nothing is ridiculous. I bought this for my boys because it was a N64 and Superman combo. When they didn't like it, I tried it and could not believe I paid money for this unfinished lousy game. By unfinished, I mean it should have never been released with its slugish movements and sorry game plot or strategy. Words can't describe how bad this game is. If I knew where to send it, I would mail it to its maker just to let him/her/them know that they can have their game back."
1,The Death of Superman!,"Slower than a turtle, less powerful than a vacumn cleaner, able to leap tall bar stools in his dreams, it's....Super Dud! All the information I needed to know about this dreck of a game was the fact it was voted this past winter as the ""Worst Video Game on Any Console In History! "" In HISTORY! Titus did themselves no favors by putting out this crap. Superman needn't worry about Kryptonite because this game will kill him quicker! Avoid like the plague or give it to your worst enemy. I'd rather play ""Pong! """
1,When Nintendo put the Offical Seal of Quality on this game....,"It was so bad the seal rejected this game, and rejected Nintendo for forcing it on this qualityless product.The universe couldn't handle this game being described as quality, so tt ended up causing a paradox that eventually erased the seal and the company that made it from existence.How could you SUperman?"
5,The Best Worst Game Of All Time,"I'm not giving this game 5 stars for being goodI'm giving it 5 stars, as the worst videogame in historyThis legendary game is so horrible; it's a collector's itemI have to say there is talent into making this game, because you need talent to make a game this badIt takes no work without any determination to produce a game so horrible! The graphics are the worst by far of any game around it; the game play is astonishing(ly bad)! There's no other game in comparison that even amounts to the level of suck it produced.5-5 because it tumbles over 0 and goes right back to 5, as the best worst game of all time"
1,5 stars to the brave souls who played it.,"What, you thought they were for the game? Get real... The arcade game was more fun... and all you did was walk/fly right and punch!! I can't go lower than one with the ratings, so I decided to use it for something worth while. The actual score I give Superman 64 on a scale of 1 to 5 is -12. See if you can find anyone who disagrees...Ehh, changed my mind... I'll show the game's score... wouldn't want anyone to think I actually liked this thing...(You know what, I get tired of people thinking I actually LIKE this thing, so I change the star rating to give it the score it deserves...)"
1,Titus Ruined My Life,"My friend's birthday was coming up and since he liked the Nintendo 64 and Superman I figured this would have made a nice gag gift. I was wrong. He never knew about the dreaded Superman 64 and decided to play it hoping it was going to be better than sex,money, and booze COMBINED. He couldn't get past those rings in the very first stage and in a fit of rage he attacked his mother and bit the dog. The psychiatrist deemed him clinically insane. He vowed that once he was out of the mental institution,he would come after me. I now live the rest of my life in fear because I made the fatal mistake of purchasing Superman 64 for only 1 CENT."
1,Worst Video Game Ever!,"I got this game from the flea market. I got home, I played it and I can't believe how bad this game is! The graphic is horrible, the controls are awkward and the music in the menu doesn't have the Superman theme song! First off, you fly through sooooo many rings, after the rings, you do a task. After the task, you fly through MORE RINGS! After more rings, there is ANOTHER TASK!! The one task I couldn't complete is saving people from a tornado, so I just gave up. This game is really BAD, its the worst game I have ever played in my entire life!! Its bad as ET on the Atari 2600. I would NEVER recommend this game to anybody at all. If your a hardcore video game collector, stay away from this game! Pick a different one!"
1,"I am a huge Superman fan. I prefer Batman,but I like Supes. Coming from a Superman fan....THIS SUCKS.",Im actually 34 years old. I decided to play a video game to see how Superman's powers would be used. Dying from an ordinary bullet? NOT SO SUPER. The graphics are so 1970s and clunky that I could barely stand to look at the game. Get Batman Begins instead. I hope the Superman Returns game in 2006 is better than this cheaply made game. I think the money we have to pay for this($3.00)was the budget for this game.
1,don't waste even your crap for this game,"Dude let me start by saying this this game did not deserve the buck I payed 3 days ago in the rental shop. The ""not-exacly-a-game""has horrible graphics that look as if a kid took a dump in it and then ate it and crapped it out again. The sound is not exacly a sound it's more like screams of horrible pain. In general gamespot is right, my cus' is right, hell my teacher is right. This game sucks. Nintendo sucks, for letting us endure this torture. And finally Titus and the people that made this game. Hopefully someday someone will go in titus productions and start killing all of these idiots that made this game.....GOD I HATE TITUS AND ALL OF THEIR SUPERMANSah!"
2,"Are you okay, Superman?","It looks like Superman got killed by kryptonite. Everything about this game is crap: Awful control, glitches (I glitched through a wall once and couldn't get out of the room I was in), terrible graphics, a horrendous multiplayer mode, and a billion other things. Flying was okay, and the music wasn't so bad, but that doesn't save the game. Stay as far away from this as you can, and if you get touched by it, wash hands with disinfectant and wash clothes with bleach, it's that bad."
1,They would have to pay me to play this game again,"Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store. I thought ""superman, I'll have to try that"". I have never seen a game more deserving of the following: THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED!!! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED!Somewhere far, far away, Superman weeps."
1,Don't buy this game,If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad.
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!!...,THIS GAME GIVES NINTINDO A BAD NAME THIS GAMES GRAPHICS ARE HORRBLE AND ITS REALLY BORING
1,What happened to superman?,"This game was, without a doubt, the worst game that I have ever played. It make a complete mockery of superman, and did not meet up to it's expectations. The plot was stupid,the game was no fun and it,barley had any action at all. This game should be cast out of video game world and set to rot. It was the worst game ever!"
2,"Boring, unimaginative, and repetitive",This book could be used as an example of how to take an intrinsically exciting topic and grind it into the dust through furiously dull writing. Only the actions of the heroes themselves keep this book alive.
3,"BEAUTIFUL CHAIR, HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE","I ordered two chairs to have them in time for Father's Day. It is advertised that the products are received in 3-5 business days, however, one of the chairs did not come until the 7th business day and I did not have it to give as a gift for Father's Day. I contacted customer service. First they said it was advertised wrong and they are sorry. Then I called back and they claim that they ""have a right to catalog error"". The chairs were very nice, hard to assemble (the instructions were poor) but i would NEVER do business with this company again. So much for the customer always being right even with the proof and admittance the company was wrong, they would not refund me one penny for the shipping."
1,Beware,I just put two of these together and at first I was very pleased with my purchase. Later that night we had a strong storm and some of the chairs finish ran off and soaked into our brand new stone patio. I just called the customer service to see what they suggest and they were not helpful at all. She said I could pack the chairs up and return them if I was unhappy. How would this fix my problem I asked...she said this is the first time she has heard of a problem like this. If you buy this chair beware of the finish.
5,Excellent reference book for analog microwave radios,George Kizer discusses analog microwave radio in detail. The review of line-of-sight (LOS) basics is very good in relating theory to practical applications for modern digital microwave systems
4,An interesting combination of unique songs,"This CD was what introduced me to the entire New Age genre of music. It's variety of artists provides you with a broad scope of different styles ranging from piano solos to tribal rhythms. But I must comment on the very last song, The Earth Tribe, by Nando Lauria. It is probably one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard in my life and I often listen to it, loving it for its strength and its powerful vocals and rhythms that express emotion in a way that just grabs you by the heart. I would even dare to say that it is one of the best songs on the CD and one of the best I've run into while listening to New Age. The CD is worth trying because its variety of styles will probably please many different tastes."
4,Nice quality pendant and necklace,"I purchased this as a gift and am pretty pleased with the actual product. A note: the picture makes this look like it is all silver, but in fact the circle around the amethyst is actually gold in color. It is still pretty, but a bit of a surprise."
5,Fierce.,"Brilliant first six songs. Forget the rest, I read where Tony said it was made at the record company behest and under corporate duress to make them be more commercial and add the singing.Every Jazz drummer or ""Holdsworth fan"" or ""Fusion-head"" should own this excellent CD. Tony's playing is mind-blowing, fiery and passionate and yet avant-garde in many ways, and Holdsworth as always, soars high above this great music with wonderful references to Django Reinhardt, Charlie Christian and Coltrane...intense and a real classic that you'd be dumb not to own."
3,Uneven,"This, being a combination of two albums, starts off good, but only one track of the second album is bearable."
5,Essential Holdsworth album,"Yeah, I know it's technically a Tony Williams album (and his drumming IS excellent), but Holdsworth is all over these records. As noted by another fan, this is really two albums. The first, ""Believe It!"" is a classic. Intensely funky jazz fusion, great tunes, and the way-ahead-of-its-time, incendiary guitar of Holdsworth. The second, ""Million Dollar Legs"" is another story. Put yourself in the shoes of the owner of the record company that put this out. You've just released one of the greatest instrumental fusion records EVER. What do you do? Easy--with the same personnel, add vocals to some of the tracks, water the music down into vapid R&B and tell Holdsworth to tone down his guitar playing--WAY DOWN. One of the great cultural crimes of the 70s. Despite this, I'm STILL giving five stars to this cd. Yes, ""Believe It!"" is that great. If you would like to read more reviews like this, check out JazzboNotes.com."
3,Who cares?,"Who cares if it's not that good a video? If you're a real Creed you don't mind these things, but just care about having the video. Besides, I don't think it's that bad at all. It gives a whole load of info on how the band got off."
2,CREED ? Unauthorized & I Now Know Why !!,"I too was disappointed with this DVD. Poor production value and yes the greatest disappointment was no music at all. Learned to be more careful in my DVD choices. I was looking for more like VH1's ""Behind The Music"" about CREED but I got a home movie documentary. Anyone that comes across a REAL DVD with Creed live or MTV type videos of them I would be very interested."
1,Why oh why didn't I listen !,"I read the reviews and there was one that said if your truely a Creed fan this is worth it, or something like that. I wish I never read it. Yes, I ordered this DVD & everyone else was so right, it's bad. Just a bunch of people I have no desire to see talking about Creed. Please, if you read my review trust me, it's not worth it. I probably will never watch it again."
1,Totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Everyone who wrote a review was so right about this video. It was so much of a disappointment I cried when I saw it. The best part of it was seeing Scott Stapp's beautiful face, other than that it stunk and anyone who made money off of this should be sued."
2,Not the best Creed show you've probably seen,"I heard this video isn't really that good. If you really like Creed and want to see a video, wait until later fall 2000."
3,Read my TRUE REVIEW on the video...,"Ok, this video was full of information which was interesting for the fans who want to know how Creed got started. Their are some interview clips with the band unlike some of the unauthorized videos but still no performances or music by the group just like the video warns you on it's cover. Over all, this video was pretty good and interesting. One thumb up!"
1,Disapointment,"This DVD is low quality and has NO music on it. It is not even put out by Creed! This is a documentary, but the Behind The Music on VH1 was better. Save your money...this sucks."
2,good but stick to the rock,"Snowball with Lorainne Lewis I thought was good not her best but good, She has the voice for Rock not dance, It was too candy pop not raw like when in Femme Fatale.The good news Lorainne is back to her roots good old rock and roll with Rok to Puss and I'm so happy her voice is back and better then ever,but all and all snowball was worth the purchase but if I knew it was more dance then Rock would've passed it up"
4,DOWN MEMORY LANE.........MUSICAL,"This DVD is a wonderful tribute to the music of Sigmund Romberg and his delighful songs. It may be considered ""hoakey"" by today's generation but the older generation will enjoy the wonderful stars who have passed on and left us with their talents. A down Memory Lane with quality......anda 4 Star Rating!"
4,Autobiographical Humor,"Oscar Levant's humor is timeless. His best humor is directed toward himself. It's a fun read, I'm going to buy the rest of his books. Better than watching television."
3,Does the Job - Not totally Fog Free,"I've been using this product for over a year now and I have to say it's hard to shave out of the shower anymore. This mirror has a strong suction cup, and slight magnification which makes it a little easier to shave. It's durable too, about once every two months it loses suction and falls down from a height of about 6 feet and has never taken any damage. I have a tile shower and I have problems getting this product to stick to the wall when it's wet. Simple solution is only stick it when it's dry, and it'll stay up for months.It does lose it's anti-fog coating after a while, but a quick splash of water clears away the fog long enough to finish shaving. You can purchase a spray that will bring the anti-fogging properties back but I haven't found that to be necessary."
2,Did not last long,"Mirror was fogless for a few months. Then had to purchase spray to keep it fogless without great results. Ultimately the swivel where the suction cup attaches to the mirror broke. Overall, it lasted less than 1 year."
3,Okay but small,After a couple of weeks it still functions well. No fogging in shower. However it is fairly small.
1,OMG!!??,"I can't believe that Michael J. Jackson was involve in this movie. If I would have seen this before I wouldn't purchase it. I don't think Michael read the script before accepting this participation in this dum movie. It suppose to be funny but it is boring!!! I know that the movie was kind of crazy but BORING!!!!!!! I wouldn't give not one sigle star for it, sorry!!!!"
1,"Miss-cast (this) away & The, Sorry. I can't do this with a straight face.","Wow. How do crappy movies like this get made? I guess it helps when you know some of the ""stars"". Have you ever heard that if given enough time, a monkey on a typewriter could come up with something? Here you go. If you really must see this movie, be warned. This is time out of your life you will NEVER get back and you WILL regret it. Maybe I'm being too harsh. After all, there are people out there who think SPACEBALLS is the funniest movie ever made. My guess is that a majority of them wear helmets."
1,if this movie had any actors it might have been better,"this is such a poor movie don't even waste your time thinking about renting it. If you do rent it you might have to kill yourself later. It had so many cheesey CG effects it could have been made better by a 13 year old boy on his home pc. All of the parody references in this stinker are pure crap... I hope that they prevent a future movie like this from being filmed... If you do see this movie you will never get that time back in your life, just don't do it man!!! LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO WATCH MOVIES LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!"
1,AMAZON SELLS BOOTLEG DVD's,"I can not believe that AMAZON participates in selling pirated, counterfeit DVD's. I can't imagine the thousands of individuals that have been duped into thinking they are buying a legitimate DVD because they are buying from AMAZON directly and not an individual seller. The federal government should investigate this place. It is horrible that they would engage in this type of business whether they are giving refunds or not. Counterfeit DVD's are such a huge issue and it's one thing if an individual places bootlegs for sale here but for AMAZON to partake is really just disgusting and really, really aggrivating when you receive what amounts to a $1 piece of junk you could have purchased out on the street."
3,OK movie,It was a corny movie and it was funny. Wouldn't order it again seeing it once was enough. Wouldn't rush out and get it.
3,Andean Legacy,"It's an OK CD. I am not crazy about the choice of music, which is not totally Peruvian. Recording is so so."
3,Wanted more,"I initially enjoyed this very witty autobiography, but soon became bored with the moralistic tone and advice from Darrow. The first half of the book was fun to read,however,this changed in last chapters when Darrow began to take himself too seriously. Darrow was a much better attorney than philosopher."
4,Pessimist by Profession,"Interesting for style as well as insight into courtroom tactics, psychology of jurors, crime and muckraking. His basic premise about jurors: If he can get them to imagine, he can get them to doubt. So his approach, always personal, was perpetually appealing to imagination. It worked, mostly, even when clients were guilty. It's his reliance on reason that makes him a skeptic. Causation is the basis of his world and personal views. Seeing the effect of the law, he argues that judging is worse than judgement, and he would dispense with both. He is at some pain to describe what he gave up to plead, rather than the life he gained by it. His seriousness can be attributed to the injustices he saw, effects he attributes more to chance than choice. He espouses the theory of continental drift, in 1939! A sharp mind interested in everything. As he says himself, if he had to do it over, . . . he'd have been a scientist."
3,SUPER DETAIL!,"When i got this for Christmas ia was truly impressed. The age recomendation is a little off because it only took me around ten hours when i was ten. I only found afew problems like R2-D2 is not even close to scale and it can take me up to an hour to perfect the gears in the back so they will work right. Some may disagree with my raitings, i gave it a 3 in fun because it is more like a model than a toy, 5 in educational because all legos help in hand-eye cordanation, biulding, enganeiring and amagination. i only gave it a 2 in durability because it brakes easily."
4,Close to Perfect,"As soon as I saw the model I had to own it. The Lego designers have surpassed themselves with this model, and it is almost as if Incom themselves had a part to play in the design. The model itself has everything, from the shield generator, to the proton torpedoe launchers, and of course, the ability to ""lock s-foils in attack position"". The more observant Star Wars fan will also recognise ""Rogue Squadron"" markings on the s-foils as well as the finely detailed cockpit interior, complete with targeting display and adjustable control stick and pilots seat.Overall, not too challenging to build and it makes a great display piece."
5,A Complete Masterpiece...,"The X-Wing is soooooooo cool.I got for my 11th birthday.(I really asked one of my spoiled for it and I got it.It takes a whole lot of time just to build it but when you are finised with this deadly X-Wing,it pays off.The X-Wing is sorta hard to play with because of its size,but when I get home from school I go to my room and just stare at it because its so cool.The things that bother me about the the BIG X are:the mini-fig r2.he should be 3 times that size!!!And the thing that bothers me the most is that wind shield should kinda slant into the body of Big man X.Other than that the X-wing is err,completely AWSOME!!!!!"
4,"Good, but not genius","This is a collecton of his regular columns. They are funny, but not side-splitting. If you want to see what Dave can *really* do, try ""Dave Barry's Only Travel Guide you will Ever Need""."
3,It is a great book. . .,"But I was disappointed by the fact that I had already read almost the entire thing on townhall.com. Had I known that the book was simply a collection of Dr. Adams' articles from his website, I definitely would have waited for the paperback.For anyone who is not familiar with Dr. Adams, but finds the topic interesting, I would recommend the book."
2,This guy is a joke!,"First of all, I'm a UNCW alumni. I've heard stories about this guy for years. This guy is a total loser. He's one of these Rush Limbaugh wana-bees, only he's not funny or clever. As far as UNCW being a conservative school, uhhhhh...yeah right. Students here live to get drunk, high and laid. Hardly a bastion of conservatism. Half of the sudents are from New Jersey! This is a party school-it's right near the beach! Conservatives are in a vast minority here-believe me. Mr. Adams isn't speaking for an oppressed minority-he's speaking for a almost non-existent minority. If he had even a clue about the UNCW population he would know that. Unfortunately, his head is in the clouds."
1,this book was written 15 years ago,"last time it was called Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus by Dinesh D'Souza. if i remember correctly, the author claimed that the Duke University English Department was bringing about the end of Western Civilization.guess they're not trying hard enough, huh?"
5,a scream,"I suppose that I liked the book because Adams says all those things I wanted to say in college. My humanities and ""social science"" classes were so absurd but you didn't dare saying anything to the professor who controlled your grade. Adams works with these people all the time and he just gives them hell. HE is too funny for words."
1,"Old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old","This book is old. I thought it looked dated and then saw that it was originally put out in 1990 -- 11 years ago. If you're looking for current design and fresh inspiration, do NOT buy this book."
1,Dough Pan - Not pleased,This product was described as Made in the USA. However when I received it the Made In was actually China. It looked like a great loaf pan but I returned it. Greatly disappointed.
2,Don't understand why they're so popular,"These are okay pans, but not for the $15 a piece price. I've tried making meatloaf and breads in them, and they always stick to the pan even when I heavily crisco or crisco/flour the sides and bottom.The pans are also smaller than my other 9x5 pans so they tend to overflow with bread recipes created for a standard bread pan.I like the fact they are aluminum and feel sturdy and they don't overcook my breads like a lot of metal pans have in the past, but I'm going to be looking for something different that doesn't destroy the sides and bottom of everything I make and can take being sprayed with PAM and not destroy the pan."
1,"When it works, it's good.","I bought this thing because of the over all good ratings. Sadly, it was nothing but a tease.I'm on my second one in less than a year and it's currently broke. The first one broke after a month of lite use. I used it for spot cleaning after an aging cat. The first time the thing stopped spraing, so I sent it back. Now with my second one, guess what has happened. No water comes out the hose or the bottom. It sometimes will spray for about 4 seconds. I've tried priming the pump, unplugging it, everything.I rarely take the time to warn people away from a product. I'm usually the sort that is very forgiving about a products flaws, but this is my SECOND one that has broke in the exact same way. Coincidence? Or a shoddy product?"
1,Disappointed to say the least!!!,"I have read the reviews of others who have just purchased this carpet cleaner. I raved about mine and recommended it to everyone after using it the first time. However, now that I have owned it for a year, used it a few times, I would not recommend it to a soul. Here's why: 1) the water dispensing mechanism is in the handle and is controlled by a weak little spring and a cheaply crafted plasic bar. After using the machine a few times, the mechanism becomes weak and stops working. 2) Though it does have a ""Proheat"" title, it is a ""No-Heat"" system. The water never gets any hotter than the tap water you used to fill the tank. Without water and heat, it's pretty hard to clean anything! 3)The whole thing is put together with screws, so cleaning hair and dirt out of it is impossible. I would recommend a Hoover. One model has a two year warranty and is $100 cheaper. I am not happy with this purchase and I paid $250 for mine."
4,Good for carpet but not for hard floors,I purchased this thinking the scrubbing brushes worked for both carpet and hard floors. Turns out that when you put the hard floor attachment on the unit to suck up water on hard floors it raises up the unit so the scrubbing brushes no longer touch the floor. The hard floor attachment has a fixed brush on it (not mechanical) that you are supposed to brush across a hard floor in order to remove the dirt. It does not touch the grout between the tile.
5,love my bissell 9400,"we have been extremely pleased with our bissell 2X select #9400 -- with a dog, a cat, grandchildren, and living in the rural north, we have a lot of dirt that we bring in to our house on a daily basis. it is so handy to get our bissell shampooer out any time there's a need for it to clean up carpet, furniture, automobiles, etc. the one time investment has paid for itself already, since i used to rent a ""rug dr."" steam shampooer 2 to 3 times a year for aabout 25.00 plus shampoo products each time. my bissell cleans just as well, and is much more convenient to use, with the shampoo stored in the machine at all times. having it available at all times is such a plus also."
1,buy a HOOVER!!,"I borrowed this carpet cleaner from a friend. The waste water bladder is very small and had to be emptied often. I also had to fill up the shampoo compartment just about as often. I stopped 3 times to do both for my living room carpet alone. My sister told me about her Hoover and how you seldom had to do that. I borrowed hers for the rest of the house. Having used both the bissel and the hoover in the same time period, I got very familar with both. The bissel doesn't stand a chance compared to the hoover. The hoover got the carpets so much cleaner! I wouldn't waste my money on a bissel. Go HOOVER!!"
5,LOVE my Bissell 9400 ProHeat 2X Select,Very easy to use. Easy clean-up also. My carpet looks like new even in the very high traffic areas. Easy to find cleaning solution in stores and is reasonably priced too.
4,Easy to use!,"I really like my new Bissell 9400 ProHeat deep carpet cleaner. It was very easy to use, the carpet looked great when I finished and best of all, I didn't have to pay Stanley Steamer or worse, rent one of those Rug Doctors!!."
2,Won't buy another Bissell,"I have had two Bissell proheat carpet cleaners. I only use them for my family room which is an average size room. I do have two dogs, but I always throughly vaccumn before cleaning. The first Bissell lasted about 8 uses and then quit working. I am now on the second Bissell and although it works marginally after about 6 uses, it doesn't really extract the water from the Berber carpet very well, so I am left with very wet carpets that have dirty water left in them. My carpets are not exceptionally dirty (I clean them about every other week in the spring due to paw prints from the outside)and I do clean the machines after using them.I won't buy another Bisell and am considering a commercial grade machine instead of a ""disposable"" residential model."
2,Works good...wears out quick,"I have used our cleaner about 8-10 times. It cleans great at first. The problem is the way the water reservoir fits back on. It's kind of a pain to get it to go down on so that it suctions up the water. If you don't get it down just right it'll just leave the water on the carpet, so now you have a stain that is merely watered down and spread over the area instead of gone. At this point, the water reservoir doesn't stay locked in place. It just doesn't suction up the water anymore. I've only had this thing a couple years--it should have lasted a lot longer."
1,Bissell ProHeat 2X,"This machine is terrible. Bissell has been making these for some time. You would think they would have it by now. I'm the mother of four kids and a dog, and it's so frustrating that now I have to clean this thing and pack it back up and take it back to the store. An absolute waste of my time. They should test these machines and make sure they actually work."
2,Workmanship,"I bought this cleaner as I had used my Dad's older one he bought four years ago.This cleaner did great for about 12 times, the plastic insert ripped (other older cleaner had hard plastic) the brushes do not rotate, it does not pick up water anymore and leaves the floor wet.We even ordered the part and it would not work. I am so disappointed with the poor workmanship and choice of using plastic parts that break and assemble of the parts.Would NEVER buy a Bissel again. Stay away from this brand and check out the parts in other brands. bj"
5,Easy clean-up,"This steam cleaner is very easy to use once you put it together. The directions don't clearly show where the attachments go, but that's the worst I can say about this product. It is VERY easy to take apart and clean the pet hair and dirt out of. The one I was borrowing required a screwdriver to reach accumulated cat hair and the handle portion had to be laid flat and unsnapped to access the water tank. Picking up the water tank portion in this machine is as easy as picking up a bag with handles. All in all, a great, no fuss, user friendly product."
4,Works very well.,"This machine works very well, and gets our carpets very clean. I have to go over the carpets a few times, but then they really are like new. The reservoir is a pretty good size.The minuses? The unit is pretty heavy. After a couple of rooms, your arm has had a workout. On the other hand this means the brushes are actually getting into the carpet.Another problem is that the soap reservoir is not easy to fill since the opening is small, and you can't set it down to pour cleaner into as it has a weird shape. Also, on the ""heavy traffic"" setting the cleaner comes out way too fast. Just stick to the normal and light settings.Still, the positives outweigh the negatives so far. A common complaint seems to be cleaner drying and clogging the lines. I haven't had that problem yet, but I usually use all the soap and then rinse with the plain water setting. In any event, it beats renting a cleaner from the grocery store every few weeks."
5,Read the Instuctions,"This is my second Bissel... the first one ended up with a frozen pump because I left it sit all winter with cleaning fluid in the pump...(1) after using, you are supposed to turn it to ""rinse and run straight water through it so that the cleaner doesn't gunk up the pump... according to the directions. I had the pump repaired but it didn't work very long.(2) The Bissel is not meant to pick up what your vacuum cleaner was supposed to pick up before the steam clean. VACUUM THE FLOORS THOROUGHLY. Especially if you have pets.(3) Take it slow if you don't do it right the first time.. u have to do it again so no time saved on doing it quickly... I love this steam vac it's the best!!!"
5,Paid for itself after the first use.,"I purchased this steam cleaner on sale at a membership warehouse. I have two dogs and we clean our carpet every 3 months. We previously used an Oreck steam cleaner, but the results were less than satisfactory and the cleaning solution is expensive.I understand that some people claim that this machine malfunctions. This didn't happen to me. I cleaned my entire house, including two sets of steps over a few days and I'm extremely pleased with the results. The house smells fresh, the carpet looks 90% better, and the floors dried within 12-18 hours. We cleaned the whole house on the ""heavy traffic"" setting and still didn't use more than $25 worth of carpet cleaning solution. The machine is simple to use.If this steam cleaner never works again, it's already paid for itself. Professional companies want $250+ to clean our entire house, and we did it ourselves for less. Plus, since I purchased it at a store with a liberal return policy, I can return it if it breaks down."
2,Worked for awhile,"The machine did a great job for the first 1 1/2 years. I would clean the carpets every 3-4 months. Then it stopped dispensing the soap. After tinkering with it I was able to get it to work again....for one area rug. Once it ran out of solution I was back to the same problem. I have ordered new parts, talked to customer service, nothing works. I'm back to renting a Rug Doctor."
1,Waste of $,"Used this machine only 10 times on my upstairs hallway carpet. It completely stopped suctioning leaving me with a dirty, smelly, wet carpet. Called customer service & was told that there was only 1 service center in the entire city of San Antonio. Chances are I won't even bother making the drive."
5,3 cats and 1 dog.,"I bought this 3 days ago, and wow. First I went at the floors with a pet vacuum. Than I attacked it with this beast.. Clean everywhere, no more stains from pets or baby's formula. The only issue I have is that if you dont have a great vacuum it will leave chunks of fur on the carpet from where you carpet cleaned. However while cleaning up fur chunks is not the highlight of my day, knowing that my carpet is now fur free is GREAT. I call this thing a beast, its big and bulky, I wont lie, but its great. I have not used the attachment yet for my hard floors, but I am sure that will work great as well"
5,Love this thing!,This is a serious cleaning machine. I am so excited to be able to clean my carpets without having to hire or rent anything. It definitely works and I have no complaints!!
5,Amazing!,"I have to say we beat our carpets to death. Really, so I was a bit skeptical that this little machine would help. Wow it sure did! The one thing it didn't get out was bright red vomit (sorry for graphic nature) but it lightened it significantly. Everything else it took out. When we moved in our carpet had ""freckles"" now it doesn't. No pro could take them out. I did learn that rinsing makes a big difference. The Power brush tool that is included is WONDERFUL! We actually fight over who gets to do the next room. It's that fun!"
5,EXCELLENT CARPET CLEANER!,"I do have to say that this cleaner is awesome! I live alone and work full time but also own a puppy who, over the months, has managed to create quite a stench in the apartment as he embedded his messes into my carpets. I cleaned them regularly using sprays and what not but it built up over time. I decided to get a carpet cleaner. I did my research and found this one to be the most highly rated. I also liked it's ease of use. I LOVE this machine. It truly is easy to use. It's also easy to assemble and it cleans beautifully. I used to walk into a doggy smell apartment and now it smells normal again! Thanks Bissell! I've gone on and on to my colleagues about this machine! It's awesome, highly recommended!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!!,"The manual lacks communication, the customer service lacks English (where do they send these calls to and who can understand the people when you need help???), the machine is way more complicated than simple. Unless you're a guy used to bad instruction manuals and used to putting things together which don't easily fit, this machine is not for you. After cleaning carpets (so I thought), apparently one hook on one part of machine was not hooked on properly, so no cleaning was done.. I would not have gotten this machine had I known its ridiculous trivial quirks.. cleaning? We'll see.. the carpet had to be re-cleaned by me and the lousy machine after talking with customer service and asking for an voice without accent.. they transferred my call then to the U.S.. unbelievable lousy manual, accented ""customer service"" and tricky machine, unless you're a techno-junkie who loves tinkering with toys all day. Don't buy it.. taking my back to store."
5,I love my Bissell,I am so impressed with the Bissell ProHeat 2x. I had my carpet cleaned by a professional company 3 years ago and when they left there were a couple of stains they said they couldn't get out. So when I used my bissell on thoses stains they came out! Our carpet looks brand new. The only thing that i needed to watch for was making sure that when i stopped the carpet cleaner that I put it on a towel or tile floor so that the dirty water that was on the rollers didn't go on to the carpet. Other than that I had fun cleaning my floors.
1,Worse piece of junk manufactured,"We purchased this Proheat 2x about three years ago and just after going out of warranty, it stopped spraying water out of the main repository. Took it to the only dealer, unfortunately an hour away from us, and left it for five weeks. Repaired it to the tune of $ 90.00, basically almost half the original cost, got it home, worked once, 45 days later, same problem. Repair facility said they had had a lot of problems with the solenoids and to bring it back and they would repair it while we waited. Again, an hour away. Nothing more frustrating then having a supposed high-end machine stop working once, nonetheless twice, and always right when you have just started to try and clean your floors. Bissell should get out of the business!!"
2,Big waste of time and money,"I spent a lot of time researching products that could clean my carpet and thought I'd found a really good one. But it's been nothing but problems for me. It's pretty good at getting out the old stains, but it leaves new ones! I now have more stains than when I started because all this dirty soapy water comes out the back and stains the carpet. So when I go over it again, new dirty soapy water comes out the back and I can never ""catch up."" It's really heavy and it's a pain to use.We have given up on trying to keep our carpets clean on our own and are just hiring people to do it for us. Save your money. This product does not work well."
1,Don't Wast Your Money!,"I don't understand the other reviewers as this thing is JUNK! I cannot even waste my time telling you all the bad about this machine. It is simply garbage. Don't buy it.I don't care what the packaging says, I will be returning mine to the store."
1,DO NOT BUY,"WORSE THAN I EVER IMAGINED. DOES VERY LITTLE AS ADVERTISED. TOOK IT FOR REPAIR THINKING THAT IT WAS JUST A BAD UNIT, WAS REPLACED WITH NEW ONE AND STILL JUST AS BAD....LOOK ELSEWHERE"
2,missing parts,Just recieved this product and it was missing the product guide at the assembly parts. I called Bissell and they said 7 to 10 days. Wow what customer service!!!!! I will write another review once I am able to use the product.
2,Don't Buy It!,"I had one of these that I thought was ok, but after a year and a half it fell apart while I was cleaning with it. I decide to look around and decided to spend more money and buy the Oreck Steam cleaner. What a difference! I went over the areas I had cleaned with the Bissell and couldn't believe how dirt it left behind. It is worth the money to get the Oreck."
5,Comparing Reviews,I'm in the market to buy a steam cleaner and I'm leaning towards this one. I see almost 200 4 & 5 stars & around 40 1 & 2 stars combined so it tells me this is a pretty good machine.
1,Don't waste your money!,"We looked at a number of machines before buying this one, it seemed to have good reviews, and all the features we wanted. It turned to be a complete waste of money! It won't even take out tiny, brand new stains! My Mom spent $120.00 on a cleaner, and has better results. It does a terrible job of sucking the water out. Keep looking, this is not the one you want!"
2,Dirty water collects on underside and drips into carpet,"After cleaning my front room with the 9300 model from Costco, I immediately returned it. About half way through cleaning I lifted up the cleaner on it's nose to look underneath and the underside was coated in big drops of dirty water. When pulling backward, most of those drips can be sucked up, but when pushing forward they will drip off the vaccuum, into your carpet, then you have more drips to get out. I certainly wasn't happy to see all the dirty drips that I had to work to get out, so now I'm back in the market for a home carpet cleaner."
2,Less than OK,"Very poor design. Not only do the bushes continue to move in the upright position which could easily damage your carpet, but they move in the wrong direction causing all the dirt to go the wrong way. All the dirt gets kicked to the back of the machine, while the suction is at the front of the machine. After about 10-15 passes, you'll get a dirtball all over your clean carpet. The side brushes are completely worthless, they were put there for looks. If they do anything, they push the dirt further down into the carpet. I gave it 2 stars because it did pick up some dirt in the vaccuum."
2,Reliablity is not good; Poor value,I have had a ProHeat cleaner for about 6 years. It gets used 3 times a year to clean carpets and 6 times a year to clean tile floors. During this time the motor stopped working about 6 months after I purchased it. Bissell returned it with a refurb unit which had a broken cleaning fluid dispenser trigger. Since the repair I have repaired it twice due to a leaking hose and crimped hose that prevented the cleaning fluid dispenser from working. Repairing this unit is a nightmare. Anyhow the cleaning fluid pump stopped working permanently (today) and appears not to draw a suction anymore. I question the value of a these types of carpet cleaners when a rental is $20 a day.
1,DO NOT BUY!,Don't buy this product... after only 4 uses it does not work at all. Absolute waste of money
1,Beware!!! Cheep plastic parts nightmare!,"I Have had the Bissell ProHeat 2x for 18 months and have had 7 parts broken so far. This machine is made of fragile plastic parts that break easily even though I am not abusive or treat it roughly. One part was covered by the warranty within the first year. I need to buy about $100 worth of parts to replace the still broken pieces. I paid $285 for this machine at Walmart and am very dissapointed with the poor quality of the product. I had a Hoover carpet cleaner for 15 years and had no broken or damaged parts in all those years, I just wore it out with use. I would NOT recommend this product."
1,piece of garbage!,well i have used mine 3 times and twice it has gone to the repairman cause the tank expanded.. now it doesnt work at all. biggest waste of money ever.do NOT buy this.oh and my repairman said Bissell and Dyson r in for repairs way way more then any other brand........
1,BAD BAD BAD product--no stars,"Well I was aggravated and then read the other reviews to find that dispensing the water and solution is an ONGOING problem with the Bissel rug cleaners.My unit has stopped dispensing after two uses. I bought it one year and two months ago and used it twice. The first time it worked well and I was pleased with the results. The second time it would not spray the water, but corrected itself after a few moments and the results were good. This last time ...no water at all!!! After trouble shooting myself and with customer service for over and hour and a half I gave up. I was going to have it serviced, but after reading the reviews and realizing that it is a piece of JUNK, I guess I'll save my money on servicing it--It's the Bissell Pro Heat 2X"
5,Does what we expected,"We purchased this machine to avoid Bissell's Green Machine, a carpet spot cleaner that requires working while on one's hands and knees. We use it to clean up after our cats' accidents and coffee spills. With patience, this Bissell captures about 98% of stains without a lot of human effort or muscle."
3,Good until it does not work anymore,If you are going to buy this steam cleaner I suggest that you also buy a replacement warranty. I have purchased two of these. My first one lasted a year and my second a year and a half. This is an excellent steam cleaner- gets the carpets really clean. Whem my first one broke I opted to buy a second one because of the results I achieved from it. Now that my second one has gone out- not sure if I will buy another one again- but if I do I will definitely buy an extanded warranty.
1,Faulty water spray mechanism,"First the good stuff - it worked pretty well when I used it first. Then it went into storage for about an year.When I got it out this summer to use it, water will not spray! I called the Bissell service center, and the first thing they asked me was,""Is it an issue with the the sprayer""? Seems like it is a chronic issue with the heater section. Soap water dries up inside, and blocks water from spraying. The heater is nothing much to wrote home either.So after being a $100 lighter, I learnt that after using this cleaner, I should spray out all the water (without soap), and store it in a perfectly clean condition. The dealer asked me to buy a Hoover. The design is too complicated and prone to failure, according to him.BTW, I have a vacuum cleaner by Bissell that has been going on well for a long time."
1,NO LONGER BISSELL'S GUINA PIG,"DO NOT , I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS - ZERO STARS FOR THISThese bissill units break without fail. I have owned three in three years, and each and everyone is broken. Every year they have a new model and now I know why, we are the Guina pigs for bissell. It will work fairly well at first, then it will be unrepairable. Thier pro heat is a joke, your tap water gets hotter. I have four dogs- I bought a hoover steam vac 1 month ago, you would not believe the dirt and grime that is coming up after three years of these horrible bissell units. Just spot cleaning and one unit lasted long enough to clean my entire carpet, ha but I just did the carpet with a HOOVER and it is unbelievable. Do yourself a favor if you are serious and need a unit to last, DO NOT BUY THIS. All those who rave on this , talk to you in about 6 months!!"
1,Caveat Emptor,"My 9400 ProHeat 2X seemed to be doing a nice enough job till after about a year of occasional(once per month)use when it stopped dispensing cleaning solution. Took it in for repair and Bissell flatly refused to honor the warranty claiming there were numerous problems with the unit caused by abuse (""Did you drop it down the stairs?""). 1.)I know I didn't abuse it. 2.)I live in a ranch home - no stairs. Nothing doing, however. When I pleaded with them to investigate they called me two days later to repeat that they would not repair it. All in all a very unpleasant, ugly experience. I will never purchase another Bissell product again."
1,"Three defective/broken pieces on new machine, refused warranty service","I bought a BISSELL power carpet cleaner, the so-called ""top of the line"" (over $200) Pro-heat 2. Right out of the box, three critical plastic pieces broke rendering the machine useless before it even touched the carpet! It never cleaned a square foot of carpet before it broke! I contacted BISSELL customer service and they said the parts were considered ""wearable parts"" and are not covered under warranty. This piece of junk is labeled ""Made in China"" and suffers from numerous manufacturing defects which cause failure in the cleaning system which can actually damage carpet more than clean it.Do yourself a favor and stay away from BISSELL power carpet products as the company uses cheap materials and foreign labor, then says they can't replace even brand new, defective products because they're considered ""Wearable"" even if they're unused."
1,Disapointed!,"Used once, and put away for a year. Went to use it for the second time and the unit quit spraying, Cleaned thoroughly all lines and unit would only spray out of the hand attachment. And then quit again. Very disappointing cleaner. Will never buy again. Anyone wanting this machine can pick mine up at the dump! Will rent one next time!!!!!!!!Oh and another thing, Be prepared to wait for quite some time for your carpet to dry and pray to God Almighty you don't get mold under your carpet and make your whole household sick. :("
1,A piece of junk....,"I'd give this product zero stars if I could. I've only used this machine 4 or 5 times, & it's already ready for the trash (tomorrow's trash collection day, you'll see this machine at the curb!). The hose attachment quit working after using only once. Today, I used the water only rinse & it sprayed water all over the place. Keep in mind, that I always thoroughly read the instructions before using any appliance. I know I was using it correctly. I am very disappointed in this machine, I bought it to replace a Bissell Big Green Machine (which was a cannister type, not an upright). That machine had its faults, but was reliable, & lasted over 10 years. I don't want to waste money repairing this cleaner, I'll call a professional carpet cleaner next time. Bissell used to be a reliable brand name, but now only makes junk ( I could go on with the leaky Little Green Machine I have, but this is not the place to do so)."
3,needs improving,I did not get the product I ordered... a smaller less effective model was sent. Also the bladders are way to small and many trips are needed back to the water source.
1,Terrible,I bought this model after having a Hoover for years. This thing was a nightmare from day one. Unlike my Hoover this cleaner left my rugs soaked even though I would go over them several times. After a year the only way I could get the sprayer to work was to prime it then I would get a few seconds worth of spraying. I am going back to the Hoover.
1,Read the Negative Reviews. Bad Product.,"I've had the same problems as most others and only used it three times in 2 years. out of warranty . Bad pump design , burns out moment it runs out of water . I feel robbed."
3,Broken part - hassle to replace,"I recently purchased this machine because I like the optional attachments. I have only used it three times and while overall it cleans really well, I discovered the plastic at the end of the hose was broken when I was cleaning the stairs, causing the tube to detach from the attachment wand, rendering the hose useless. I called Bissell who said that I could take it to the nearest location to have it looked at (2 hour drive from my home) or find a box to package the whole machine in to send it back to them to look at. I explained that it was a small piece of plastic that if they could send the part, I could fix myself. They said the part is not available and repeated the previous options. The experience was frustrating for such a small, but integral part of the machine. I'll either try to duct tape the thing or return the whole machine and get another. What a hassle for such a small part!"
4,Nice with only 1 downside,The size and weight of this cleaner are ideal for the house with limited room. It is roughly the same size as a stand-up vacuum.The only downside is emptying the dirty water reservoir. It is a bit cumbersome but workable.
1,Works for Home Carpets - Not Rugs or Oriental Carpets,"I have many different types of rugs and regular installed carpet in some rooms. This works fine on the regular installed carpets. Its heavy so it stays planted to the ground to suck out the water. It is very heavy to use and pulling and pushing does wear you out.On silk rugs, it just doesnt work, it cannot suck the water out.On wool rugs, it has a hard time sucking the water out. If it is a thin wook carpet on a wood floor, it will not suck the water out at all.On dense rugs, with a high knot count, it does not work.PLUS you cannot turn off the brushes so you can really beat up your rugs if you keep using this on them."
2,good performace but maintenance issues,"We were initially very pleased with this purchase. Great price, great reviews, and great performance. Then we discovered, after 4-6 uses, that the steamer is prone to clogs. We continue to experience problems with the water/soap not coming out. I suspect this is a problem with dirt and debris clogging the dispensers. We have two cats. Perhaps the cat hair is too much for it but we bought it for this purpose and are overall very disappointed. If you're lucky enough to avoid the clogging, you will probably be very pleased with the cleaning power of this steamer."
1,You don't want to buy it,The quality of this product sucks. I only used it once and its pump broke. The replacement of the pump cost me half of the price I paid for new. Will never ever buy this brand again!!!
2,Sprayer Broken,"For the money you spend, this is a piece of crap!! The sprayer and water pump broke after 2 uses and customer service was no help. Cheaper to rent one than to spend all of the money to purchase. Will never but this product again."
3,Cleans great but can be improved,"I agree with most of the reviews here. With respect to cleaning, it does the job.However, the small cleaner tank is one frustrating task to keep filled. Another bigger problem is the constant dripping of dirty water back onto the carpet - this ends up leaving dirt spots everywhere. The comments about using easing up on the trigger doesn't do much. To get around this, I use a quick trigger releases while moving the cleaner backwards so that the bottom plate doesn't get wet (basically do the opposite of the guide which states to keep the trigger pressed while moving forward). Although more expensive, the Rug Doctor ($480 @ Costco:Rug Doctor Mighty Pro 95306 Quick Dry Carpet Cleaning Machine) or any other cleaner where there is far less machine-to-carpet contact will return far better results."
1,it is good at getting your floor wet.,I am so unhappy with this machine it only picks up 1/8 of the water it puts down. I am thinking about putting it on ebay and buying something else.
4,rug steamer,This product is very effective at cleaning rugs. A little heavy to push and a little difficult to refil
4,Finally,I waited too long for this product. It was easy to put together and even easier to use. I can prolong the life of my very expensive (and dirty)light beige carpet! What was I thinking?
3,Good read,Belloc did a nice job on Joan of Arc. Short and easy to read. I recommend it to anyone who likes belloc
2,It broke within a week.,"After about a week, the wire of the plug started to peel off, and I can no longer charge my laptop."
5,"Narada, Beautiful New Age","I love New Age music. All of the Narada offerings are great but this one is my personal favorite. Eric Tingstad, and David Arkenstone among others. What more can you ask for? If you are looking for New Age with a heart, music that flows, instead of sounding like it was generated by a computer, you will love this one!"
4,A really good cookbook investment,"I bought this book a year or so ago and have made most of the recipes in the book with my boyfriend. Latest: Zuchinni and Pine Nuts in Phyllo, Yellow Squash Soup with Indian Spices, Fresh Tomato Soup with Sage and Parsley Sauce. We regularly make a few other recipes. One thing, we always tinker with recipes but we consistently find her spice alottment bland, and so always double the garlic and add something to nod the heat up. But, what fun would cooking be if you didn't tinker with the recipes? Madison also writes warmly- and she gives good advice on ingredients, and notes on what foods/herbs will contribute to the soup, etc."
2,Too complicated,"If I could, I would return this book. Although the few recipies that I have tried turned out to be quite delicious, I usually turn to other books when looking for a good meal. The reason for this is quite simple: The recipe lists are just too long, specific, and complicated. I do live in a town where you can probably find any ingredient that is required here, but I am just not willing to spend all day preparing dinner!"
2,Too gourmet for me!,"This must be the cookbook that Marge Simpson was looking at when she saw the never-ending list of spices it called for in and proclaimed ""they've got to be repeating some of these!"" If you regularly keep 100 different spices, 15 vinegars, 3 cooking wines, and you grow 4 varieties of fresh herbs in your kitchen, then you should be ok. Otherwise, every recipe's going to cost you dearly while you stock your cupboards with gourmet ingredients."
2,"I'm not a simple person, but this cookbook goes overboard.","I have read my share of vegetarian cookbooks and have been impressed by some, left apathetic by others, and been thoroughly annoyed by a few. I'm afraid this fell into the last category. The recipes are needlessly complicated and have nonsensically long names. I'm not a simple-minded person, and I love to cook, but I'd rather go with the pinch-of-this, pinch-of-that cooking method, and trust my gut instinct in the kitchen."
2,"Greens Cookbook, no photos","Although the recipes are fine, the book must be made for dyed in the wool vegans who are already familiar with how these dishes look when they are prepared. I went shopping for ingredients for some of the recipies but some of those ingredients are so expensive, ie. pine nuts, that who can afford it? If the book had photos of the dishes and they used substitute ingredients for the expensive items, it would get a five star from me, however with out any photos the book is more of a mystery novel than a cook book.Jean-Paul Déry"
2,Not the right cookbook for me,"I'm sure every recipe in this cookbook is delicious, but I seldom use it and regret buying it. This would be a good book for people who see cooking as a hobby: something they do occasionally, for fun, without worrying about time, convenience, health or expense. For everyday cooking, it's pretty much useless. The recipes are all quite time-consuming and complicated, requiring, for instance, special stock which must be homemade and for which store-bought substitutes would be unacceptable. Lots of the recipes are heavy on the butter and cream, which is fine for special occasions but not the way I want to cook on a regular basis.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for special-occasion recipes. Everything I've cooked out of it has turned out great, and I would definately consult it for dinner parties or similar occasions. But I don't think it will be a particularly useful cookbook for busy people trying to eat in a reasonably healthy manner."
3,Yummy but baroque,"Many of the recipies in this cookbook are quite cook. On the other hand, the author is extremely particular about ingredients and preparation techniques, and often goes overboard in her expectations of the cook. I kept expecting to find a recipe that started, ""First, thresh the wheat that you planted last winter with a hand-whittled oak threshing tool..."""
5,Exceptional recipes,"While SOME recipes may be time or skill prohibitive, many are simple but elegant. The spinich and filo with goat cheese was exceptional, and not difficult to make at all. My girlfriend and I are about to make it for the 3rd time in less than a month, because we know it's the blue-ribbon winner at any potluck. A good way to look at this book is as a resource for dinner parties and potlucks, and not for day-to-day cooking. Still, it helps you to look at ingredients and combinations in JUST ENOUGH of a different way to make all of your cooking more mindful and creative."
5,A Classic,"I've been cooking from Greens for years, and it is still a classic. There are so many great dishes to choose from. One must, however, keep in mind that most of the dishes are for somewhat special occasions, and they take time. The majority of the recipes are not the kind to throw together in ten minutes. There are other vegetarian cookbooks designed for the everyday."
3,Decent freshman effort,"I read this book after having read the author's 'The Informer'. This book showed much of the same talent, though I felt it the introduction and solution to the murder by the 'Boy Genius' was a little too much. Much of the book up to that point, though, really felt like the prose of a confident author. I am giving this three stars only because I did not like the introduction of this character. It seemed to simple, to pat. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.If you like reading fiction from other countries and other time periods, though, this is definitely a great book. Since this was written for a Japanese audience, it seems unlikely that views, the disgust that several of the characters demonstrated for the recently concluded war were intended to make the story more palatable to a western audience. Learning more about the cult of the tattoo, likewise, was intriguing. And, finally, a glimpse into Japanese society circa 1946 was, for me, a pleasant experience."
4,SS Van Dine in Japan,"This is a good straightforward locked room mystery. It is set in post war Tokyo, and was written in 1948. The odd world of full-body tattooing forms a backdrop.Aside from some sexual references (don't expect sex scenes) it is very like an old SS Van Dine mystery from the 20s (The Canary Murder Case presents a similar locked room puzzle). Not hard to solve but fun to read. A good light book for a few hours entertainment."
4,Disturbing Series of Murders,"I like the post-war Tokyo setting of this story. References are made to the horrors and trauma of war suffered by former Japanese soldiers. It also describes the wide discrepancy between different groups of people as they hold onto wealth and status, or madly scramble to grab them. We also see glimpses of black market and yakuza life styles. The murders are creepy and disturbing, and the psycho-sexual world of tattoo customers is nicely underlined. I'm not sure I quite believe the Boy Genius as a viable character, but I'm going to read the other books by Akimitsu Takagi as they become available."
5,Captivating,A very enjoyable read with interesting array of characters even for those who do not typically read mysteries. This story has both titillating sensuality and intriguing obsession. I enjoyed the contrast between the true nature of the characters and how others perceived them. I was also intrigued with the author's presentation of post-WWII Japan. This is a well-written translation that succeed in revealing the author's sense of Japan.
2,"Good story, Kindle edition full of errors","A very clever and entertaining thriller. This would have been a four-star review, except that the Kindle edition has literally more than one error per page. It looks like the book was scanned and then not proofread, for example: he word ""in"" shows up as ""m"" about half the time, punctuation is often missing or randomly appears in the wrong places, and some words are just clearly the wrong word (auto spelling correction?). In only a few places is this is genuinely confusing, but I found it so pervasive as to detract from the reading experience. However the problem is consistent, so if you're OK with the free sample then you'll probably be OK with the rest of it."
4,"Not what I expected, but still wonderful!","This really isn't an audio book, if by that you think of someone reading (and to some degree) performing a book. This is more like a tape of an old radio show, with the two actors giving us many laughs and fun moments. Both I felt stayed very in character for the most part, and it was clear the audience was greatly enjoying the performance. It was considerably shorter than most audio books, only an hour in length. However, that's really the only thing that detracts from it, and made me drop it down to 4 stars. You just go away wanting it to go on much longer than it did. Otherwise, I can't imagine any Trek fan not loving this delightful CD/tape."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this cd for my husband, a great Star Trek fan. I also am a Star Trek fan and was looking forward to hearing it myself. I would have to admit, however that I was greatly disappointed. First, the cd was only about an hour in length and most of the time was used up by the audience clapping, laughing, etc. The humor was silly. I expected more from a debate between Spock and Q. It didn't seem worthy of the characters, especially Spock."
3,Amusing but not enduring,"This CD is basically a recording of a performance where Spock and Q debate whether or not the Human race is worthy of existence. As one might expect, the banter between two of the greatest wits in the Star Trek universe keeps you smiling. However, I wish I'd seen the live peformance, because I don't see any real replay value in this CD. Once you've listened to it, you're done."
2,"Great Actors, Lousy Act","I am a big fan of Q, and I love Vulcans in general and Spock in particular. So I figured that this tape would be a lot of fun with such wondeful actors and characters. And the actors and characters were wonderful - both Nimoy and DeLancie delivered great preformances, absolutely top notch. If that's what you're looking for, buy this tape. But don't expect plot. I shouldn't have, in retrospect, but I did..... instead of a heated, interesting debate, Q and Spock spend Side A of the tape trading insults (Spock: ""You are a fathead.""), and Side B, where I'd expected an actual ""battle of wits"" -.... None of the material, by itself, is bad; most of it is very funny. But put together into one hour-long lump with no other content, it gets a bit tedious and leaves me feeling very disappointed."
3,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I did enjoy this CD but the debate between the two men sounded so scripted that it took some of the pleasure out of the experience. Unless you're a hard-core Trekker,this isn't for you."
4,Rhyming Flash Cards,"My students would get excited when I would bring these cards out. I used them to teach rhyme, initial sounds, middle sounds and ending soundes. I like them, but don't let your students mangle them. First graders can be kind of rough on things like this."
5,AMAZING!!,This is an amazing CD! Jimmy has done an incredible job!Very romantic. Can't wait for the next one. :-)
5,fantastic cd,"I own the us version of this cd,and I can say the Cd is packed full of great music.Jimmy Osmond has made another great album.After a long period with out a album he sure made a fantastic one.People will deffianalty have a different perspective on Jimmy Osmond after listening to this new album..If your not yet a fan you will be after hering this album"
3,NOT HALF BAD.,"Out of the four episodes, I really liked two(2) of them. That is ""Night Call"" & ""A Piano in the House."" Both of these stories I felt had an element of relatiblity to them, then the other two. I didn't feel ""showdown with the Rance McGrew"" really addressed how one would imagine the annoyance of the false protrayal of the men of the Wild West in history would be handled that well. To lightly done. In ""The Big Tall Wish"" the acting was well done, but something in the way the story was put together seem to be missing. The ending was somewhat of a disappointment too.(anyway, that's my take on it)."
5,love the twilight zone,"This DVD has one of my all time favorites on it, and the other three shows were terrific too, I love ""A Piano in the House"", but my favorite is the one with the old lady who keeps getting the mysterious and scary phone calls, this DVD was in great condition and came in a very timely manner"
2,not so great...,"I am usually very satisfied with the Lonely Planet books on travel, however I found that the prices in the Brazil book were inaccurate. I travel quite a bit for work and for personal pleasure, and have used the Lonely Planet series for most of my travel because they are such a great resource of information. The Brazil book was great in that it helped me navigate through different cities in Brazil, and it offered great recommendations on where to go and what to see. The issue that I had was once I got to places like Sugar Loaf and Christ the Redeemer the prices were much more than what the book had said they were. The food is rather expensive in Sao Paulo and Rio De Janeiro, which the book did not indicate. Overall, I was less than satisfied with the information provided."
3,it is smaller than I thought,I thoyght that it was more ilustrated..I want more maps.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4,Lonely Planet Brazil,"If you have ever read a Lonely Planet book before you know what to expect and the Lonely Planet Brazil was in line with all the other Lonely Planet books I've looked at before. Very good information. Has something about just about everything. Goes in depth on some things more then others, that is why Lonely Planet Books are even better when utilized with one other travel book such as Frommer's or TimeOut. If you were to rely on a single travel book, this one would suffice."
2,Parts of it are out of date,"OK in general but so are other travel guides. What matters most in a travel guide is that it is accurate and up-to-date. It appears the Porto Velho section has not been updated for years - hotel prices have gone up 50-100% (seriously, the $35 rooms now cost $70 in the Tia Carmem) and Internet cafés have disappeared! This is unacceptable for a product sold with a 2010 publishing date. If I had known the city was twice as expensive as I thought I probably wouldn't have bothered sticking with my travel plans through a 60-hour flight delay...Second the comment on Quatro Rodas - it's just over 10 pounds for quality, up-to-date information."
3,"A good starting point, but...","This is a good book for an overview of the country, but then you'll need something else that will focus on the particular area or city you will be visiting."
2,"Out of date, prices are 59% higher","There is no rating of sights and telling me what to skip if I have only one day to spend in a place, which makes this book hard to use. Practical information is out of date."
3,Kindle Edition is done Poorly,"Like many others, I adore my Kindle for the ability to pack my travel guides and reading electronically. But, I was disappointed with the Kindle edition of Brazil. My biggest frustration was in the Rio de Janeiro section. There were discontinuities from one page to the next and I think one set of pages was just mysteriously gone. I purchased the Argentina Lonely Planet and had no problems. Of course, like all e-travel books, the navigation is a bit miserable. I really need to use the search function and bookmarks -- but I'm ok with that as it's still better than carrying around a huge book when I travel."
4,seems good,"I was looking for information about the Amazon Basin state of Rondonia and the city of Rolim de Moura because I was hoping to visit this because of many Internet messaging etc. pals, but nothing is included.However, what is there seems pretty extensive and what can be expected for a quality guide to Brazil. Oh, I have the Kindle version."
3,Many errors in LP Brazil,"Lonely Planet is usually the best travel guide out there. Unfortunately, there Brazilian version is full of errors. A friend of mine purchased LP for our trip to Brazil in May 2005 while I got Let's Go Brazil. Like another review stated, there are several errors in Sao Paolo alone. We were search for a Italian restaurant that is suppose to have the ""best pizza in Brazil"". When we got to the restaurant, we were told by the owner that the restaurant has never sold pizza. I was told by one travel agent/guide in Sao Paolo that the person that did the section on Sao Paolo was only there for 1-2 days and there was no way he could have accurately gotten all the information that he needed in that short time span. We also had a problem finding out hostel in Rio using the map in LP. For a book that was release in Jan. 2005, it is missing much information. I would purchase Let's Go just to have another reference guide book."
2,Really out of date,"We went to Rio using this book and were very disappointed. While the background information in the books is helpful, the book is very out of date, and often inaccurate. In particular:1) Most of the restaurants recommended that we tried to go to were closed down. Those that we found were not as good as the review suggested.2) Maps are small, hard to read, and often inaccurate, placing locations on the wrong block, or leaving off crucial information, such as there are buildings blocking routes through neighborhoods. This often caused us to have to backtrack quite a distance to get where we were going.3) There was not much useful information about Ilhe Grande."
2,Dangerous!,"Will not handle 500 volts! Mine 'blew up' on 480 volts AC !! Should be recalled. When mine blew, it caused a circuit breaker to activate which killed power in one of the Operating Rooms where a surgery was in progress....not a good day."
3,Probably won't improve your game much,"I bought this book as a start to studying middlegames. I found that while the games are interesting and I enjoyed reading the book, it didn't really teach much. A lot of the stuff it teaches (IQP, avoiding blunders, positional play), it does so very superficially. I'd recommend this book more for pleasure reading than study."
4,Practical Advice,"This book is useful, but not the one chess book you should buy over all others. As other reviewers have stated, it deals more with specific subjects than a look at everything in the middlegame. ""Worst Piece First"" echoes what other writers have said in the past, but it is a useful way of thinking about it which has improved my play. The other tidbits are interesting, such as showing how black can activate his French bishop, but they are not a whole book. The chapters that make this book worth buying are 'Keeping Control' which shows how to deal with complex situations, and 'Attacking Play' which is arguably the most instructive chapter. Overall this is not a book, but a collection of advice on separate subjects, though they are all interesting and helpful. Though not well structured, Kinsman produces a workable book."
5,A very challenging game,"This game requires skill, luck and intelligence to solve all the puzzles in the game. It's a good thing to have infinite lives, but it's annoying to start over and over when you die. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes a challenge every now and then."
4,EXCELLENT GAME FOR PEOPLE WITH A STRONG STOMACH,"This is a very addictive game that invites you to solve puzzles, route for the strange little alien you control, and watch the wonderfully bizarre story unfold. However, I need to add that there are a lot of gas-related jokes in the game, and some of us found them to be a little disgusting. One of the things you actually have to make the little alien do from time to time is pass gas - and I could have done without that. But it's a really interesting and original puzzle game with a story, and you should try it. I've known people who absolutely can't walk away from it."
2,fustrating,If you like games were you have to do everything over and over a thousand times before proceeding to the next area just to do that a thousand times more than this game is for you. But I don't consider that very fun. The controls are easy however and the game can be amusing and addictive at times but I certainly would not consider it very fun to play.
2,BORING! (and creepy.),"OK. So i just played it for like a half hour. But it was one of the most boring half hours of my life! And I'm not big on creepy games like this. As you can probobly tell, it's about some alien creature that's a slave in a factory called ReptuFarms or something. The factory makes meat out of animals. Most animals in Oddworld (the would where Abe, the mane charecter lives) are extinced. I won't tell you any more of the plot. I will now tell you why i don't like it. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not big on creepy games. If you are, I guess you might like it. But it's not even 3D! It's just a 2D game where all you do is walk left and right. And the controlls are REALLY hard to remember! But, if these things don't bother you, i guess you might like it, though it's kind of old stile gaming. Well, thanks for reading. Bye!"
4,Blast From the Past!,"I was thinking a lot about this game, I had played it at my brothers house a long time ago and wanted to get it. No one carried it in the stores around me so I checked her on Amazon.com. I found it at a great price and used and when it came it was in good condition with the case and book inside. I am pleased and enjoy it when I have time to play. This game makes me smile and the endless journeys are fun."
5,LOVE IT!,"i am totally a kid at heart when it comes to this game! i loved it years ago when i had it originally, and i love it now! thanks for keeping awesome games like this from slipping into obscurity!"
2,Not Really Flamenco,"If you are new to the sound of Flamenco, this is a gentle introduction, fused with the modern sounds of jazz and predictable 4 beat rhythms. It would be more appropriate to call it a jazz fusion with a dusting of flamenco. Calling this album FLAMENCO does a great disservice to what is really flamenco-driving, complicated compás, complicated remates, wrenching lyrics and just guitar, cajón, (maybe flute) palmas, cante and footwork. If you're looking for real Flamenco-IT'S NOT HERE!"
2,Narada does it again,"How is it that narada can pick over tons of albums and not come up with better compilations?This album is boring and the music is not even real flamenco.If you want authentic Spanish guitar music check out any number of awesome classical recordings by Julian Bream or John Williams and their performance of the works of Rodrigo,Sor,Albeniz,Granados,DeFalla,Sanz,Milan,Mudarra,and numerous traditional works."
5,my favorite one-must read!,"This book was great! it's one of my favorites. i recommend this book to anyone. i love shining and samantha! Anyway, in this book samantha finally gets her own horse (shining) and is almost ready to race! Then Mandy,a disabled child and a friend of smantha's wants to buy shining and her parents make samantha an offer. Will smantha have to give up Shing? and will Shining ever get to race? read this to fing out.(if u must know Sammy keeps shining and wins all of her races!)-A must read"
2,Not what I expected....at all!,"Yes, the ring has a nice sparkling effect to it, but the quality is beyond poor! It resembles one of those rings that you'd purchase from one of those machines...hands down!"
4,This is one of Lilian Jackson Braun's best books!,I like this book because you would never suspect who the killer actually is. It was exciting all the way through the book. Now since I've read this book I'm thinking about reading all the other Cat Who mysteries.
3,"A necessary read, though not a great one.","Sometimes I wonder why Qwill has to be so negative about everything. If he were a real person, I doubt whether I would want to be that great of a friend of his. Lillian Braun writes his attitude to be that he is always wonderful, and everyone else grows boring and tiresom. Instead it is Qwill who grows boring and tiresom. In the later books, this deficiency is corrected, but when I go back and read the earlier books, I always wonder where Qwill gets off.As with all the books, Qwill and Koko find the killer in the end, though Qwill's life is put in grave danger to do so. There is a little character development, especially in the relationship between Qwill and Polly, and we learn a little more about Bushy the photographer and Derek Cuttlebrink finally comes into play.Over all, it is a necessary book to read if you are intent on reading the series, but you could probably skip it."
1,One of the lesser books in the series.,"In a series that for many years was one of my very favorites this is one title I never cared for. The reason is simple, Quill comes off as such a total jerk. If the main character comes off as unlikeable it's hard to much care about what happens. I will give one example of what I am talking about. In this book there is a sucicide. This man just walks out on his wife and child to live in Pickaxe for no reason what so ever. { All this is set up in The Cat Who.. Talked to Ghosts} When his wife lets him know she will not take him back he kills himself and Quill makes the wife into a heel as if this mans own actions had nothing to do with the situation. It was at that point I stopped reading. For some I am sure this would be perfectly fine but it stuck in my craw. But of the first 14 books in the series this is the only one I would not recomend."
3,Remote on-off use,"Excellent for remote on-off appliance applications under 15Amps. There is a small amount of leakage current/voltage that appears, and is seen on low wattage bulbs as a very dim light before the bulb is actually turned on. So the device does not turn off completely the device, but has small currents still on the load to be switched. BEFORE working on this, make sure the power to the circuit is disconnected. It may appear to be off, but the switched output is still live and still lethal if you come in contact with the exposed wiring behind the receptacle, or to any device or appliance daisy-chained on other receptacles."
4,Landscape Control Module,The module works well to control Nightscaping lights and probably others. The module should be available for outside use also but I have not seen it for this use for a long time. Bad decision on their part. Everything is goin WiFi so that is probably the way it goes.
1,RELAY PROBLEM [ IT BREAKS!!!!!! ],"I took mine apart when it failed after 2 months.There is a plastic part in the relay mechanism which will break and render the receptacle useless.This part is very lightly/poorly made.The INSTEON AC receptacle might be a better choice.Smarthome 2473SWH OutletLinc INSTEON Remote Control Outlet, White"
2,night of the hawk,Overly detailed and unrealistic characters. Highly ranked characters are too overly emotional and reactive to be believable. Might be ok for readers overly involved with technical details
5,Don't miss this one!,"If you are a fan of this crazy and wonderful group, you can't miss their Speedwood music! Michael and George have a singing technique that grows on you! And the words to their original songs are very meaningful. Love these guys and their music!"
4,Brits can do american,"there is a difference in style, vocal and presentation between British and american, but this is really worth it. Dame Judy Dench in long wig doing ""Sixteen"" is FUNNY. ""10 cents a dance"" is it the song, the singer, or the dress? Ruth Henshall, Claire Moore and most of the rest are new to me, but that is the fun part. And Aunt Ellers comment on Hugh Jackman from Oklahoma rehearsals, well I won't spoil it. Broaden your horizon to talent from across the pond."
3,It's okay,I suppose I was hoping for a little more. It's good. I just was hoping for a stronger selection of musicians and music.
2,Inadequte translation not of accent but medium,"I love these songs, or at least most of them. But somehow they do not have their emotional and musical pull in this format. I am not quite sure why. Whether it is the modest production values or some of the less-than-powerful or song-appropriate voices, the emotional power just does not come across. Note the versions of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and ""If I loved You."" Still, as other reviewers have noted, there are some good moments. Namely the version of ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" with Judi Dench. Melodious and funny."
3,false advertising?,"MS ANDERSON, THOUGH LISTED IN THE CREDITS AND ON THE FRONT OF THE JACKET,DOES NOT APPEAR IN A PERFORMANCE ROLE. SHE DOES A SHORT INTRODUCTION ONLY. THE MUSICAL PORTION OF THE DVD IS COMMENDABLE, HOWEVER."
1,Dud,I have had two of these systems and both were duds. The first I had for less than 3 months when it went crazy and did everything but work correctly. It ruined many CD-Rs by finalizing them before I told it to. I had to get it repaired 3 times before it remotely worked...it stopped working again shortly there after. I got it replaced with a brand new one and it broke 2 months later with the same problems.
2,Good Idea but Poor Design,"I hate Tape Guns so I was really anxious to buy this new Thermal Tape Gun. While it sort of works ok, it will not accept standard size rolls of tape. I bought the Thermal Tape gun and then went to Office Max and bought a bunch of standard size tape rolls. Guess what, they are too big for the Thermal Tape Gun. I repeatedly wrote to InnoDesk but they never bothered to answer my emails. My recommendation, wait until some comes up with a better copy that can use standard size rolls of packaging tape."
1,Scent fades quick,"After a couple hours of applying multiple sprays the perfume has no scent whatsoever. Nice bottle, pretty price. Wish i could return product (s), purchased 3 fragrances, but can't return flammables."
5,Great perfume!!!!,I bought this perfume for my little sister for christmas and she absolutely loved it!!!! The bottle is elegant and the perfume is light and pretty smelling! I recommend this perfume if you are looking for a perfume that is light and not to over bearing or strong smell.
1,smelled as cheap as it is,the spray mechanism was broke so the perfume practically poured out and it didn't even smell good. I just chunked it in the trash all together...doesn't even deserve 1 star
3,Informative!,"As a hypnotherapist, it was nice to read more of the medical approch to hypnosis. Lots of information about why and how we get sick. It made me feel a little more knowlegable so that not only can I help, but I could also explain why and how we get sick in laymans terms, very advantagious in the pretalk. In reading the book, some outdated technics were used,(probably filler for the book). I'm not saying that they don't work, but these techniecs are no longer used.Overall the book has lots of good scripts, hypnotic inductions, deepening technics & tests. Another book to add to my collection!"
4,A bit of the Holy Land delivered to your doorstep,"This is a fine set of solid, carved olivewood candlesticks. The design is elegant and visually pleasing. The quality is high; the construction appears durable. They arrived without apparent flaw, and in a nice package that would allow for a pleasing presentation for gift giving.My only criticism is not with the candlesticks themselves, but in the product description on the website. The diameter of the candles for which these candlesticks are designed was either not displayed, or not displayed very prominently, and I was unable to find it. The diameter is 3/4"". (Unfortunately, the candles for which I had intended them are 7/8"".)Fortunately, the packaging will make a nice presentation should I choose to give these as a gift to someone. ;>"
5,"A quality, durable and handsome case...","I am absolutely glad I didn't waste my time or money on cheaper portable DVD cases, though it was very tempting. I bought this over 2 years ago. This case is just made of the best quality (I love CaseLogic products) and has held up to my 4 year-old's constant fiddling with (it is HIS portable DVD player after all). He loves to carry it around, like to doctor appointments or restaurants, and people comment how adorable he is with his little ""briefcase"". I just wished they sold it locally so I could have saved money on shipping charges from the Amazon merchant. Still, I have no regrets whatsoever and am glad that we have a unique DVD case that get people asking where they can purchase one like it."
4,oveerview,"The Encyclopedia of Volcanoes is a methodical by the number overview of most if not all of the known active and inactive volcanoes on earth, with a narrative on the different types of volcanoes and how they are formed. Included is also an explanation of the ""mega volcanoes"" otherwise known as ""calderas"" and how these can have a global effect on world climate and lifeforms. Such a wide coverage limits the in-depth geologic knowledge which would probably be beyond the casual reader anyway."
2,Keep browsing; this is junk.,"I ordered this on a whim and was very disappointed when it arrived. It's very cheap-looking and the clasp broke the first time I put the necklace on. I tried fixing the clasp, and then the chain broke.Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk."
4,review,"The untold story,a passion for speed has revealed for the very first time striking images of a legend that never fades away. In specific details the philippe defechereux has reconstructed his ephemeral journey on earth and finally the tragic accident that took his life at a very prime age. Thru that JD was perceived at a new angle. Not a reckless driver who exposed his own life to danger but an unfortunate victim caught in a twist of fate. He even flagged a warning to careless driver a few weeks before his death. The talented artwork of illustrator JeanGraton has enhanced the image of an idol who has captured the world's heart and deep regret lingers. This book is perfect for a tribute to a beloved idol whose legend stays immortal"
5,this is a must for celtic music lovers.,This cd is a must for celtic lovers or people interested in what celtic music is like. It has a wide range in types of celtic music. It is one of my favorite cd's in my collection.
5,Pretty remarkable!!!,"There are few CDs that I enjoy more than this one. While the other ""Celtic"" albums that I've purchased left me wondering why I bothered (or, more often why my friends have bothered), this one truly delivers!!!"
5,A wonderful collection of music!,"I had this CD as a young teenager back in the 90s and listened to it a lot, after wearing out the tape I upgraded to CD and still listen to it a lot, a wonderful collection of Celtic songs that are great for listening to when relaxing (or cooking, as I do.) One of my favorites!"
2,A Piece of History,A film made when sports stars were idolized not crucified. Joe Louis a true American hero is portrayed in a a bigger than life light. Corey Wallace who plays Joe Louis bears a remarkable likeness to the Heavyweight champion and does a fair job of acting. Lots of good original fight footage which add to the film. Only a true fight fan or someone who grew up when Joe Louis was fighting would probably appreciate this film.
1,Very poor quality,"This was not at all what I expected it to be. It was hard to take apart, and worse to put back together. I returned it without even trying it. It just wasn't a good purchase at all."
2,Hard to clean,"I got this for the multi-purpose aspect: 3 different sizes for grating not just nutmeg but cheese, chocolate, etc. Plus storage for nutmeg in the covered top section. The problem is that if I want to put it in the dishwasher I have to first remove all the nutmeg from the top section. I could hand-wash it I suppose, but I don't really want to. So I now use this mostly to store nutmeg, and bought a separate microplaner for grating it."
3,Good Receiver,The only problems I have noticed is poor stagiging in the rear speakers - lack of volume too.
4,Pedal steel,"This DVD covers all the basics of pedal steel and has lots of great information about proper way to play the pedal steel and tuning ,hand position but it would have been nice to play along with some songs and spend a little more time om blocking but there is a lot to learn on this DVD ,it has taught me alot ,Dale"
4,fast paced and very good....didn't mind the sub titles at all,"THis movie was very good. The acting was excellent, plot really good. It was easy to follow and the sub titles were not a bother at all. I would definitely recommend this movie."
3,formula hollywood thriller from france,"ok but not especially great 'suspense' with some pretty predictable, always incredulous, 'man-in-an-impossible-situation' suspense that usually stars the likes of liam neeson. meh."
4,Smart action thriller,"Smart action thrillers are rare. Rarer still is a smart action thriller that features a complex yet comprehensible (and credible) plot, characters you care about, and vivid, crisp directing. ""Point Blank"" is one of these rarities. It utilizes many elements of classic action films--an innocent ""good guy"" who unwittingly becomes caught up in a dangerous plot, a woman in jeopardy, corrupt cops, and unexpected twists. The film avoids cliché, however, and it moves along at lightning speed (total running time is about 80 minutes). The French setting is an added bonus. Subtract a star if subtitles annoy you."
4,Male Nurse Fights Crooked Cops and Bad Guys,"This French film (with English subtitles) was relatively action packed albeit with only one vehicular crash and several chase scenes. Unlike Hollywood, it required good writing and cinematography to carry the day. See if you can track down the trailer first and decide for yourself. The film runs about 1:45 and may work for you if you can either speak French or enjoy foreign film. You will find violence, some harsh language and a relatively formulaic plot. That said, if you enjoy action/adventure, this one should fill the bill."
4,Nice flow.,You can tell that the writer and director spent a fair amount of time on details which to me is an accurate indicator of quality. The storyline of an inadvertent citizen being drawn into a bit of criminal and police conspiracy intrigue has been done before but this film had enough twists to that story that it was still engaging. It had a nice flow to the action - not excessive and overly stereotypic in the chase scenes. Acting was passably OK but kudos to the cinematography to keep the whole experience feel really close to the viewer. A few parts seemed a bit too unlikely but not excessively so.
4,Happy to find this breastfeeding book,"I was very pleased to find a book about breastfeeding that I could read to my children. They're all made of Mama's Milk and I think it gives them pride to hear not only me, but a BOOK say how great that is. I was slightly disappointed in the quality of the pictures. They're not very sharp nor clear. But overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was so excited about this book that I told my Dad that I wanted it for Christmas (not even for the kids, for ME)! When I opened it and read it for the first time I was so disappointed. The pictures are out of focus and grainy and the text is very plain. I was really hoping for a book that would be sweet and make me think of all the time I have spent nursing my kids. This was not it."
5,My daughter's favorite book!,"Thank you so much for carrying the book, ""I'm Made of Mama's Milk""! There are so few breastfeeding books--especially for toddlers about toddlers! It is my daughter's favorite book! (She'll be 2 this July.)"
3,"Great Pictures, Weak Prose","I had been looking forward to receiving this book after reading all the reviews and recommendations, but was very dissappointed with the actual story. It doesn't flow very well and I did not enjoy reading it to my toddler, however, the pictures are great, and my 1-year old does like flipping through the pages and especially likes the ""mirror"" at the end.All in all, it works fine for us as just a picture book, and we do enjoy paging through it and talking about the various scenes, but as I said, definitely not a favorite ""read"" for us."
3,good pro-breastfeeding book,"My (nursing) 2-yr-old loves this book! She loves the ""mirror"" page at the end. My only complaint is that the pictures are really blurry."
4,My son does not like it..,"My yougn son has no interest in the book at all. My older one does because he can read it himself, but my 2 year old wants nothing to do with it. I believe it's because the pictures are out of focus, and not very pretty looking. Some bright, bold, close up shots of babies nursing would be better.Any other time my little guy see's a picture of a breastfeeding he points to it, and says 'Baby eat'. Not with this book though.A face lift is needed before I'll give it anymore stars."
1,Unfortunately Disappointing,"I was unfortunately disappointed with this book. The pictures are grainy and unfocused, the story is corny and gives breastfeeding a bad image."
5,Favorite BF Board Book,"Sometimes the simplist of text can expalins something of huge importance. This book does that. I would like clearer photos, but my toddlers don't seem to mind. I've read this book to all three of my sons while they were toddlers at the breast. After seeing the baby in the photos nurse, we get to the mirror at the end and the surprise twist for my toddler is that they can see themselves nurse. I would have never thought to hold a mirror for my toddler like that. My kids, as toddlers, all loved the concept. This book has held up well in my waiting room."
2,Illustrations could be better!,Cute idea but the illustrations were not great. My son was not interested in this book at all! Most children are drawn to colorful illustrations...
4,Nice to have!,"There's not many nursing board books out there for infants/tots. This is a great book to have. A little 'old' looking as far as the pictures go--(fuzzy and out of date), but these are real live pictures of mama/daddy and nursling. The text was good. Love the mirror in the end!"
2,poor pictures,I recently purchased this book to help explain breastfeeding my newborn to my 3 year old. I was very disappointed with the quality of the photographs. They looked like poorly scanned copies!
2,"Nice idea, really poor execution","I was really excited about this book, but when it came, I was sorely dissappointed.The photos in the book were totally blurry. The mirror on the last page is so cheaply done the child can barely tell who they are looking at in it. And although it is a ""board book"" the pages are light weight and cheap feeling.Good idea, decent words, I just wish they had done a better job with it."
4,A wonderful book for your nursling,This is a great book written by a nursing mom. The only thing I would change about it is a bit more variety in the pictures as far as the babies age and maybe even different babies. But the story is about her relationship and her baby so it does make sense. The story is beautiful. And my two nurslings could careless whether the baby is different or not. They loved seeing a baby being nursed in a sling and in public as they are. They stare that the last page forever~ themselves. And often this can get a sleepy baby nursing and to sleep:D Love this book have recommended it several times. Figured I may as well do it here too;) Your nursing baby or toddler will love this book.
2,"I really hate to give this book a bad review, but..","At the time my son was born, this was the only book I could find that even featured breastfeeding. I sent it back. I really, really, really admire what the author was trying to do and I am still nursing my toddler so you can imagine that I'm right there with her in wanting more materials for families like ours. It was just poor quality, to be honest. The pictures were all of the same mom and baby nursing in different places, or with psychedelic backgrounds around them that were choppily photoshopped in. The last page, supposed to be a mirror, was first of all wrinkled permanently, and secondly, about as reflective as a spoon. Also, the photos themselves were not very artful or tasteful, and the one of them nursing in the tub made me uncomfortable. I felt it should be a family photo album instead. I am so sorry that a real publisher wasn't given the opportunity to or wouldn't publish this book to a higher standard."
4,"Could use a facelift, but the content is wonderful!","The photos are grainy, the poetry choppy. But this is one of only a very few that celebrate nursing, especially of an older baby/toddler. I would love to have a million books about mama milk to choose from, but until then, this one is well worth looking past the imperfections! My toddler loves it for the familiar images, and I love it for the positive portrayal of a normal human behavior that is hard to find in our culture!"
3,Pictures need work,"I think it would be great if they came out with a new edition of this book. The story is great, but the pictures need some serious overhauling-- very pixelated and somewhat outdated."
1,Great idea but poor delivery,"This is a fantastic idea and I don't want to offend the authors, but the picture quality is terrible and the rhyming scheme is very poor. All in all it was so disappointing I've returned it. :-("
2,berlin in the basement,When I heard about the berlin d.v.d. I was pumped up to the max-but what I bought was very transparient at best.The live if you call it that was recorded in a studio and it looked like it was a basement of a house.Terri Nunn who I always thought she was the hottie from the 80s looks great but they have some back-up dancers who appear to be lesbians during the marylin manson dope show does not work at all.Berlin puts on a great live show in clubs not in a basement.
2,Audio Quality is criminally bad. Nunn deserved better.,"Others have written full reviews so I will just add one warning to potential buyers-- the quality of the sound engineering work is absolutely shameful. Unforgivable. Nunn's voice is muffled and horribly compressed and, unfortunatley, the better your system the WORST it will sound. Trust me. This beautiful performer, and her bandmates, deserved so much more. Go ahead and purchase if, like myself, you are a big fan-- I am certainly going to keep my copy unless a well-recorded Berlin concert DVD comes out.... just know what you are getting. Good Luck!"
2,For fans,"I love Berlin - and have done since I heard No More Words when it was first released.I love Terri Nunn - she is STILL sexy, and has a great rock voice.The quality of this DVD, however, is APPALLING!Playing in DTS doesn't make the slightest of difference. The mixing sounds like its been done by an amateur, and the video looks like its been shot on a series of home video cameras.I have many music DVD's, and honestly, this is the worst quality in my collection - lucky I'm a fan otherwise I would send it back!Another annoying thing is they seem to have resorted to a technique a lot of older music videos used - an interview between tracks. The beauty of a DVD is you can skip to menus and sub-menus to CHOOSE what you want to watch. Mind you, Terri's words were quite interesting,, but not in the middle of the songs PLEASE!Overall, the production of this DVD is AMATEURISH at best. Very, very unfortunate as Terri Nunn and Berlin are a great band this DVD does not do them justice AT ALL!"
4,Great live show will= great live DVD...,"The shows rock harder than you assume a band known for ""80s snyth pop"" would. Terri's voice live is incredible and is an underrated singer. I was literally dragged to the show,expecting to see a washed up band. What I got was a band that sounded potent and current, with Terri putting on a show with unbelievable energy and charisma, who looks like she was cyrogenically frozen in 1988 and released yesterday. Go to the show if you don't believe me. The DVD is going to be ""Storytellers"" style, and doing some of the songs acoustic (it actually works) with the original members."
3,Blondie meets Depeche Mode,"Berlin are one of the great bands that came out of the New Wave era of the late 70's/early 80's. This DVD proves that with songs such as Masquerade and The Metro - the music performed along with Terri Nunn's vocals just makes you want to get up and DANCE!The only downfall with the performance are the 'dancers' on stage which, to me, spoils the show and the audience....the audience are just pathetic! There's no energy or emotion and to be honest, I can't understand what the hell they bothered to show up for. I think I could have made up for them on my own!Overall however, the music is so enjoyable I recommend it!"
1,"Bad Book, Maxwell","This is a slickly written, but ultimately empty book. The tone is more than a little paranoid. Mr. Ballmer is a businessman, successful and associated with Bill Gates. Therefore, there must be something evil about him. But what that is never gets stated. He curses, he knows Bill Gates. These are the principal charges leveled against him. The glib writing style can make you forget, for a while, that little is actually being said, and none of it is new. But, like most fluff, it doesn't stay with you once you're done."
5,Ballmer and Gates make a perfect combination,"When the name Microsoft is brought up, Bill Gates comes to mind, but few realize how important Steve Ballmer is to Microsoft's success. Ballmer is the current CEO, and he makes things happen at Microsoft. He has passion and truly loves his work. The author writes that the Ballmer's truly extraordinary accomplishment is putting up with Bill Gates because Microsoft's co-founder Paul Allen could not. Gates and Ballmer took the company from 30 to 50,000 employees. They make a perfect combination because Gates is the tech guy and Ballmer is the business guy. This book is a great story of a man that has always been in the shadow of Bill Gates.Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,way overhyped,"In general, I got the feeling that there wasnt a huge amount of research done for the book. I felt that the writer basically did a Lexus Nexus search, and took out what he wanted to find.I am neither for or against Microsoft - just didnt get that much out of the book. A few facts here and there were pretty interesting, but overall, I felt the book was really skimming the surface on many things."
2,Not enough materials to make it BAD!,"The materials on Microsoft Corporation and Bill Gates were written many times, in the past 10 years. Steve Ballmer lives in the shadow of Bill Gates. He befriended Bill, works for Bill and makes Billions $$$ from the Microsoft stocks. Had him work for Proctor and Gamble, he would be just another so-so manager. What makes it bad? The fact he is Jewish, tall and cursing all the time, is not enough to make him a BAD boy. I believe ""BAD BOY"" is just a marketing tool to sell the books."
1,Low rent smear job against Ballmer,"The author tries desperately and repeatedly to connect Ballmer with the nazis. The author's obvious dislike of and bias against Steve, and his assumptions that every negative rumor about Ballmer is true, speaks very poorly of his scholarship and any historical value this book might have had."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Very poorly written, frequently goes off on irrelevant tangents, clearly biased against Ballmer, MS and Bill Gates, and full of factual errors. His attempts to describe technology are laughable."
2,A hastily made tribute...,"I remember coming across this documentary on YouTube at first, but waited until I could sit in my living room to actually see the whole thing. What I saw was sort of embarrassing, and I know that Steve Jobs would find it a poor attempt at trying to tell his life story. I got that idea when I saw the poor green screening, and the presence of Will.i.am in the teaser at the beginning, I was probably gonna be seeing something that wasn't THAT good.The interviews feel sort of contrived, and it all feels too soon to find all of these people who knew Jobs.Do yourself a favor and get the Issacson bio. This isn't it."
4,Interesting Glimpse,"It's tragic the Mr. Jobs died so young, who know how much more he could have changed our world, which he certainly did. His gadgets brought about a revolution in the computing world which is now spilling over into our everyday lives, and will continue to do so for a long time. Despite all of this, few know much about the ""real Steve Jobs"", underneath all the hype the surrounded him and Apple. This film gives a mostly positive, yet interesting glimpse into who he was and is worth a watch for those interested in him."
3,Funny Mistake...,"...about four minutes in, when the narrator says, ""In the Los Altos suburb of San Francisco."" Whoops. It stuck in my head long enough to write this down."
1,Was hoping for a more objective story,"This felt like Apple fan boy/girl buzz phrases and propaganda. It was not even interesting. I was hoping for an objective documentary style look at Steve Jobs' life. I would really like to learn more about him and not just hear the same old hype. Hopefully, some one will provide that in a future book or film."
4,So interesting!,"Enjoyed this very much. Steve Jobs was a genius, no doubt, but nevertheless it's easy to understand how he engendered such strong dislike among those who knew him. His lack of respect for others and his habit of using people for his own benefit was well known. I am, however, fascinated by his story."
5,Well Done and Worth Watching After Reading Book,"I just finished reading the best selling Jobs 600+ page book on my Kindle. This was a great recap of Jobs life and really hit all the high points that he had. I thought about the fact that I alternated between reading the book on both the Kindle and my iPod touch using the Kindle app. Jobs really did change the world in many respects when it came to creativity and how he promoted the Apple product line. The movie was short, but so was Job's life. I also recommend watching the YouTube movie when he gave the commencement address at Stanford."
3,"Good except for ""Cringely""","Not too bad though and hour is barely enough for such an iconic figure. The words of ""Cringely"" are, typically, a complete waste of time as he practices his knack of stating what you already know as if he's the originator."
1,No Genius...think differently,"Doc is long and same thing we have seen already. Steve was a business man. A great one. But no genius. If you have some kind of educational background, you may understand how he was no genius. It's like Steve said, ""Think Different."" Oh yea, never compare Edison with Steve please."
4,Very engaging,Nicely done documentary. A lot of footage that has already been seen but also some new interviews with business partners. It was worth watching.
4,Better than I thought it would be.,"Alot of good info in this, I figured it would be a slobbery we love Steve kind of thing but I enjoyed it until the very end when they try to make Jobs out to be better than Edison.....Either way Fanbois will love it, normal people will find it interesting so worth a watch!"
3,"We all have roots, and His Dad Mentored also mentored his friend.","As an artist and apple user. I am always wondering what was the youthful influence that created whatever I have witnessed. You can find this out online also that Steve Jobs was adopted, raised by some great parents, and His dad even mentored his friend that introduced him to Steve W. Steve Jobs must have been raised by loving Christians parents. What an amazing house to be brought up in with love, encouragement, and a great dad. Steve Jobs and Tim Tebow had similar upbringings and I'm very glad that their life did not end in the womb with an abortion that was medical recommended in TIms mom case, or Steve case with his biological parents. I use a Macbook Pro, iPhone 4S, and IPad2. Praise to The creator of everything."
4,Beginner's insight,"As with the other reviews, this is a great glimpse of the genius behind Apple. It doesnt go into a whole lot of detail but gives you an idea of the kind impact he has had."
3,More of Tribute than a documentary,"I guess, I really can't expect much in an hour, but I was expecting the documentary to express what the real Steve Jobs was like, yes he was great person and achieved much more than I probably ever will. But the Walter Isaacson bio, portrays him as he really was (at least I assume so), he had his problems, he was temperamental, he used drugs, he would cry when he did not get his way basically he was a real human being, but in spite of all of this he had his vision and stuck with it and achieved great things."
1,Steve jobs Propaganda!,"I have always been an Apple fan...but come on...the Steve Jobs worship has really got to end! Steve didn't invent a damn thing! And, the documentary compares him to Thomas Edison and says he has 1 up on Edison...complete GARBAGE! Edison INVENTED lots of things...Steve Jobs ""marketed"" a few trinkets. Edison's inventions had a much more profund impact on life and society. Lay off the the Steve Jobs propaganda..and read some history people!The inventions of Edison made it POSSIBLE for Steve to market make his ""hip contraptions"". Steve invented nothing!A few of Edison's inventions:the parallel circuit,a durable light bulb,an improved dynamo,the underground conductor network,the devices for maintaining constant voltage,safety fuses and insulating materials, andlight sockets with on-off switches.Will the next real Edison please step up!"
1,Nothing new.,I was expecting more of his ideas and points but it is more of others praising him. It could have been better for this legend.
4,"Good, But Brief","This was a well done documentary, which explored many parts of Steve Jobs the person. It was impartial with interviews from his friends and supports, as well as some people that may have been detractors. Even so, everyone agrees Steve changed the world. I agree with one of the other reviewers, I think it should have been longer. overall, it was still a good film and showed what a great innovator he was."
2,not a total waste of an hour...,"After reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, I found it an interesting, cut down version of Steve Jobs life. I found myself thumbing through the cast of characters section of the book, trying to find the ""best friends"" that were featured in this movie. Hard to put such a vast array of information into 55 minutes. I couldn't put the book down, I recommend it over this movie, although video and the archival footage and photos were great."
2,Restless/Skraten Up CD single,"CD was purchased solely for tongue in cheek value. I mean the guys name IS White Dawg, why else would you buy this? I can't see this guy having any die hard/actual fans. Add to this the fact that ""Restless"" is basically this guy rapping over the theme song to the soap opera ""Days of Our Lives"" and you have an official LOL fest."
2,Not what I thought,I purchased this for my father. He is a HUGE hot rod fan and enjoys women too. I was expecting a quality book with great cars and beautiful women. NOT THE CASE! Great cars with trashy women. My boyfriend thought it was terrible too. Needless to say I returned the book. Please don't read this as a negative review for all Hot Rod books. Hot Rod is great and usually has great books. I gave this book a 2 because they do have great cars.
2,Hot Rod Pin-ups,The cars are much better than the girls. The women generally are not classy looking. Maybe that is what David Perry had in mind. The cover shot is the best pinup shot. The photography is super.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book after Christianity Today chose it as one of the best Christian books of the year. I was very disappointed. The main character, Dottie, is unsympathetic. She is a cold, hard woman who loves a farm more than any person in her life. She makes a series of selfish decisions and then reaps the consequences. She makes a few pathetic attempts at redemption toward the end of the book, but it almost seems like an afterthought by the author. The book left me annoyed for wasting the time reading it. Really, by the middle of the book, I could care less what happened to Dottie and felt badly for the people she had hurt along the way."
4,Great toy for a 7-15 year old,"My boys that are 7 and 10 loved this. For that matter, so did my 4yo. It works great, and it is a nice size. I also like that the globe is made of plastic, not glass. It didn't last long, though. They had it plugged in as a night light, and one of the boys tripped over the cord. The globe didn't break, but it turn on any more. It only lasted one day. But that is the fault of my children, not the product. I would buy one again to replace it."
2,fun for kids but...,"My kid wanted to buy mini plasma after she saw one at MIT museum.And I searched it on Amazon and bought one for her. She really likes it but after a few days, it stopped to work. The power adaptor seems to be broken though I am not sure plasma itself is, also, broken or not.It is so disappointing."
5,Awesome,"These things look very cool especially in the dark, looks very cool next to the streetglow Lava tubes these things are also availible in 8 inch versions"
5,Excellent Who-dunnit,"The Cat Who Blew the Whistle is a must read for anyone who loves cats and/or mystery stories. Jim Qwilleran and his feline friends KoKo and Yumyum solve the mystery when a developer is murdered and an innocent young man is ""railroaded""."
5,Very Cool,"The CD is worth the price for the rendition of Marquez' Danzon #2 alone.Maybe I am just a sucker for pieces based on Dance rythyms but I would rather listen to any of Marquez' Danzones than a Bach or Mozart symphony any day of the week. Even if that is the case, then I can assure you that if you prefer Berlioz, Stravinsky, & Ravel over Bach, Mozart & Beethoven than you will love this CD.Its too bad these composers don't get their own album....it is something else to be in the courtyard of THE Zocalo listening to Marquez' four Danzones played back to back by the UNAM Chamber Orchestra in collaboration with the Orquesta de la Ciudad."
4,"Small In Size, Big In Information!","This little gem is packed with information. Just about every facet of cigar creation is touched on. Most note worthy are the sections which list major cigar manufacturers in just about every cigar producing country, including a special section on Cuba! In addition, a most suprising and appreciated section of this book was a small yet concise listing of cigar retail shops world wide. The sheer weight of information encompassed coupled with the low price and ease of transport make this a worthy and valuable resource to any cigar aficionado on the go! In my opinion, it is definately worth considering."
1,Bonsai arrived dead!,"I ordered a bonsai from Lou's Bonsai as part of my wedding registry, and when I received the Bonsai at my house, it was dead. I have no idea how to return it, as this third party seller doesn't seem to have a website and didn't include a receipt in the package. Buyer beware!"
3,Problem solution (disc tray + shut off),"Hello I had the same problem with the unit,after 30 sec. the unit shut off + the Cdr disc tray wont come out.Solution: Open the stereo and look at the power supply,there is a capacitor 6800uF/16V,this one is broke (leaking) replace this one by a type with a higher voltage 6800uF/50V.The original is 16V but the voltage where it is located is 12V so there is to little reserve.With a 50V type you have enough reserve.The 50V is a little bigger but there is enough place to put it.I replaced it and it is OK.I don't have the remote controle,where can i get it?"
2,A Lemon?,"I bought this unit and the CD player never worked. Returnedit and got another one. It worked good for about 3 months, then the eject function on the CD recorder stopped working and I couldn't get the CD's out- unless I unplugged it for a day. ...Then the CD recorder stopped working altogether....It is currently in route to someone to fix it. I did like it when it worked! It has to break down three times to get a totally new unit. UGH> KEEP THE BOX AND PACKAGING!"
4,Locked Out,We have been trying to find out how to unlock the system. We can do anything. Can someone help us. We do not know if we pushed the wrong button or not. It looks like something is in the drive to record the cds. Another cd can not go into it.Please can someone shade some light on this.Thanks
2,EH...,wonderful up until the diamond..probably the most impure diamond ive seen in my life.was embarrased to give to loved one
4,pretty and shiny bracelet but big for my wrist,"I ordered two of these for me and my friend, and received them just today. They came with a nice little box, which was a good surprise. The design is as it is shown in the picture, but more shiny than I expected, which is a good thing. As the other person commented below, this bracelet is perfect for both casual and dressy looks. The one thing I don't not like is the length of the bracelet. It is too long for me(the bracelet sits in the middle of my lower arm when I raise my hand). Maybe that is my fault for having a thin wrist lol, and it isn's that bad. I like it so far, but we will see how it lasts as time goes."
4,"You might not have heard of Lincoln, but....",".....on this evidence they definitely have a future. If you like Nick Cave, Calexico, Morricone, Tindersticks & Cousteau then you should investigate this Spanish-tinged grandeur. Look forward to the next release."
4,"You might not have heard of Lincoln, but....",".....on this evidence they definitely have a future. Obvious musical references are Calexico, Morricone, Tindersticks and Cousteau but their Spanish-tinged grandeur will ensure that they succeed on their own merits. Look forward to the next release."
3,Decent but no CD,"THis user did a decent job of communicating with me. They also got the book to me in a decent speed. I did not expect it next day, but made it withing the time frame I expected. The pages do have alot of writing on the pages and alot of highlighting. This is handy, but my teacher does not focus on the same points as the previous user. I am not unsatified.This book was listed with a CD and that is why I chose it. It did not come with one. I was rather upset about that becasue I could have gotten one without the CD and saved money. I just feel they were trying to boost the price. THat is not an honest thing to do."
1,"A bad travel guide, hardly anything to do with invetsing.","Of course, when it comes to investing in real estate, knowing the neighborhood is a key factor, but this book provides very little information that is relevant to real estate, especially when you consider it from an investment perspective. To tell you about the climate and describe the Canadian population will hardly provide you with ""secrets to maximize"" anything. The specifics about Canadian laws and especially about Québec are completely omitted. With sections titled ""Womens in canadian business"" or ""Canadian Investments in the U.S."" , this books talks about anything and everything but is more about anthropology than real estate investment.I Would recommend ""Real estate investing in Canada"" by Don R. Campbell instead."
5,Very Well Written and Informative,"I love this book. It's very informative and well written. Everyone who is interested in moving to Canada or starting a business there needs to read this book. You'll find helpful, important information that you need to know about Canada and more than that, I enjoy reading it, not boring at all."
4,good stuff,"Got this for my sister as a gift, she likes the colors.. some are matte, and some have shimmer. They are all very wearable shades, that any skintone can benefit from."
4,heavy selection,"Francesco Clemente is my Patron Saint of Paint! So why four instead of five stars shining bright in the night sky? It's missing a whole series of pastels that happen to be a favourite. I count 16 of them. Otherwise, this collection outweighs everything else."
2,Not a hit,"I have been training in Tai Chi for 5 years and I am really unimpressed by this book. No real information. Lots of Bla-bla.If you are interested in the martial application of Tai Chi get ""Tai Chi Chuan Martial Applications: Advanced Yang Style"" by Jwing-Ming Yang.If you are interested in the energy work get ""Opening the Energy Gates of your Body "" by Frantzis.There are lots of good Tai Chi books out there. This is not one of them."
4,Very helpful and very long.,"It offers great tips. Although, some tips are dated like using a cell phone with an antenna is a good potential weapon, but no one has that version any more. The other tips are really good."
1,DAMAGED DVD (BAD BURNED / COPY),"The DVD came damaged. I was only able to play the first 15 minutes and then the screen frozed. Tried cleaning it, replaying it, but it kept freezing at the same scene. Content (of what I was able to see) seems OK."
3,marginal quality,the sea salt shaker is not very effective in grinding the salt. The pepper mill however works just fine. This product would be fine on a tabletop but not effective by the cooking surface
1,"Very small, difficult to use, easy to break","I bought these because people in my house keep swiping my salt and pepper shakers. I thought these would be good for them to take downstairs or out on the deck. Wrong. They're so tiny that it's difficult to grind the pepper and salt. One person became frustrated and broke a salt shaker because he was twisting it so hard. Not worth it. Buy big, reliable ones and chain 'em to the counter top instead."
3,A nice companion to Inspiration Information,"This is a double shot of Shuggie albums on one cd, so you get almost an entire 80 minutes worth of music. However, this cd costs a small fortune.It's amazing that both albums were recorded when he was still a teenager. There seems to be a lot of overlap with 'Inspiration Information', most notably 'Strawberry Letter 23'.The albums feature good blues-guitar playing. The music was very much ahead of its time and very much ahead of his age. Overall, there's lots of good solid blues/R&B; here.As a side note, I swear a lot of the instrumental licks have been sampled by hiphop throughout the years; they're stone-cold grooving at times!This double of Shuggie is good stuff, especially if you liked Inspiration Information. I'd say it's almost better than that one because this features more vocal tracks. A little pricey though...."
5,A Zydeco must have,"If you want Zydeco music that keeps your toes tapping, this is the CD. We saw Terry and the Zydeco Bad Boys at Cafe de Amis then had to have their CD. I play it daily/"
3,Better choices can be found,"Although the listings of firearm accessories and manufacturers are as extensive as I could wish them to be, some of the text is garbled and several of the range tests are slightly skewed. This volume is fine for the collector but for those who need the solid data I would recommend Gun Digest."
3,"OK, but not great","I had this book on my wishlist for quite a while and was so excited to finally buy it. I wanted to love it, but it really didn't do much for me. I felt like so much of the book was pointing out all the benefits of getting your kids to work... which I already agreed with. To read the previous review, it sounds fabulous, but I just didn't come away with all of that when I read the actual book.I think I will do a quick re-read and will update my review if I feel differently and somehow missed all the practical advice and benefits. (I hate to say anything negative when someone slaved away to write a book!!) But otherwise I'm ready to pass it on to someone else... and normally I'm quite the book hoarder. Sorry! :("
4,Bad Choice,The 64 controller that I purchased came with a broken toggle which makes the controller useless. I guess next time I need to pay more money for a better quality item.
5,It's just a controller,"The seller I bought it from sold it to me with brand-new conditions, but what else can I say, it's a black controller that suits me well."
5,Good stuff,"The first,the best ,and the only.There have been many different trys at the N64 controller but none could,surpass the original.I have tried most others but this one is by far the best.The shape fits great in the palm or most normal sized hands.The analoge stick is one of the toughest I've tried.So all and all this one beats the competition."
3,gets the job done,"It's pretty cheap, but the joystick is not in great condition. so if you just need a controller and you don't care too much about the joystick it works fine."
4,A must have reference book for any serious film fan,"She's sometimes bitchy and often discounts good films while praising lesser efforts, but she's always a pleasure to read. Her breakdown of Citizen Kane, and love for Last Tango in Paris are legendary, but this book is full of equally interesting lesser known items. My favorite piece is probably her long and loving look at Cary Grant. She gets right to the heart of his on-screen genius"
3,Not for Windows XP...,"My daughter loves this game, but Windows XP does not. Buy a newer version if you are running NT, 2000, or XP."
5,THE SOURCE for Traditional African-American Recipes,"This book contains hundreds of recipes that are presented in a simple manner that even a child can understand. But the food tastes far from simple -- it's excellent! Included are recipes for staples such as coleslaw and chocolate cake, as well as traditional African, Creole, and Caribbean recipes, and much more. This book is definitely a great find."
4,A Reality Check for Grant,Not War but Murder is an excellent book on the horror of the Cold Harbor Campaign. The book gives readers a much needed reality check about who Grant was and his tactics of warfare. After reading this book you will realize that Grant met his match in Lee and that Grant realized he better turn back to what he knows best - seige warfare.
3,missed the point,"As a combat veteran, I know full well the brutality of war. In this book, which does a great job of giving the history leading up to and after the battle of Cold Harbor, but missed entirely the excitement, and sheer slaughter of this battle. I kept looking for the drama, but the book moved along as a narrative instead. As the battle approached, the book failed to increase the excitement of the up coming battle and deal with the battle it's self. As a history text it is fine, as a book that truly describes the sheer horror of war, it is very lacking. I was disappointed, as one of the main things about Cold Harbor was the attacking a fortified position and the terrible aftermath of doing so. This battle was a true picture of what was to come in WW1"
2,Biased,"You would think while reading this well-written but highly-biased tome that Robert E. Lee never made the mistake of sending troops into massive frontal assaults against impregnable positions. Yet Lee was far more experienced at wasting troops in useless attacks than Grant. One need only examine the disasterous Confederate attacks at Malvern Hill in 1862 and Gettysburg in 1863 to see that Lee had his own share of ""Cold Harbors."" And that is exactly where this book fails. While Furgurson does debunk some of the myths of Cold Harbor, he acutally manages to bolsters the myth of Lee's saintly invicibility. I thought most of today's historians were moving beyond this type of mindless hero worship, but apparently not."
4,One of the Civil War's shortest battles comes to life,"The depth of this work is contained in the events that precede the battle, and the effects that the results of the battle have on both Confederate and Union armies. Although labeled as one of the bloodiest battles of the war, the crucial fighting lasted less than one hour. Furgurson carefully lays out the thinking of Union and Confederate commanders, the strategic posturing that both armies seek before the battle, and the consequential tragic results of that battle. The author tacitly lays the blame for the heavy Union losses on the antipathy that existed between Meade and Grant. Included in the book are a number of individual soldier experiences, all of which I found fascinating reading. Although not the most interesting Civil War battle account I have read, Mr. Furgurson does an eloquent job in providing just the right amount of detail without overkilling in verbiage."
5,Especially recommended for avid Civil War history buffs!,"Ernest Furgurson's Not War But Murder is recommended for avid followers of Civil War history: it focuses on Cold Harbor events, recounting the bloody campaign there and providing the first book-length analysis of the battle. 1864 history and military events come alive in a survey which includes underlying influences."
3,another recovery book,"This is simply another recovery book, no better or worse than so many others I have read."
2,Mine needed repairs after 3 years and only light use!,"I'm a do-it-yourself'er with an old house that needs work. I bought this saw three years ago and it has seen light use (3 minor projects). This week the trigger/laser switch failed and since it only has a one year warranty I had to order a replacement switch ($5 + $5 shipping) and will be fixing it myself. With Skil and Black&Decker, you get what you pay for."
2,Quintessentially derivative,"An uninspired plate of Alt-Brit-bleh, the album manages enough competency to justify catering to those who don't hear better, though I don't remember feeling anything resembling a genuine emotional reaction until the 11th track, itself an obvious Doves lift."
2,Not Very Good,"I bought this CD because of the catchy song, Underdog (Save Me). But the rest of the CD just isn't what I had expected. The lyrics are also unimaginative and I got sick of the CD after a few listens."
3,Not Dave's funniest -- but still great.,"Let me start by saying that I love Dave Barry's work -- I've been reading everything he's written since the early-'80's, always with great anticipation. With that said, I regret to report that this book is merely OKAY. Of course it was funny (how could Dave Barry not be?!), but I only found maybe two or three rolling-on-the-ground-laughing parts. So, if you're a fan of his, or if you have an interest in computers, you should definitely read it. Just don't expect as much side-splitting as other reviewers have claimed. For laugh-out-loud-til-you-wet-yourself Dave Barry humor, I recommend any collection of his weekly columns, and also *Dave Barry Slept Here*."
3,Occasional Humor,"This is not one of Dave Barry's better books. It has the usual pages and paragraphs that send you into hysterics, but the world of technology laughed at in the book is so antiquated that many of the jokes feel old. Pair that with his unsuccessful attempt to make the same jokes funny throughout the book (which he accomplishes in some others), and you have a lesser Barry book. Give one of his other's a shot."
5,A classic! Dave Barry advances to new tecnology!,"Any situation he comes across, Dave Barry can make it funny. And its all true. I think the funniest bits are about the Windows operation system version 1.0 (C:), and the question and answer bit about the internet. I dont know how you do it, Dave, but dont stop! Any true Dave Barry fan, get this book or I'll kill this dog! PS His best book, which I would give 6 stars if possible, is ""Dave Barry Slept Here"", the history book."
4,A must-read for regular visitors to cyberspace!,"There is no doubt that Dave Barry has actually BEEN in cyberspace and encountered all the frustrations and hilarity this alien world has to offer. From buying a computer, dealing with customer service personnel, to untangling the World Wide Web, this book will make you shake you head and say, 'Yeah, I've had that happen to me!'. The book ends with an encounter between two strangers on AOL that left me wanting more! Hey Dave, what happened to those two love puppies????"
3,"Funny, but definitely not his best work","Dave Barry in Cyberspace tackles one of the most intimidating subjects for laypersons (like himself) -- getting to grips with the inexplicable world of technology. Unfortunately, many of his rantings, while in typical Dave Barry style, lack the biting spark that separates Barry from the countless other humorists that clutter the shelves. Another aspect of this book which is very uncharacteristic of Barry is the strange novella which reads more like an electronic version of Bridges of Madison County than good ol' Dave. It's well-written and quietly disturbing, but seems out of place within the pages of the rest of the book.Buy it if you're a Dave Barry junkie. You'll laugh for sure, but not as much as with his other works."
3,"Very funny, until it isn't","Dave Barry wrote this book back when Windows 95 was the latest, greatest thing in personal computing. Much of it is out of date, but now it is almost nostalgiac. However, you don't really need to know alot about 1990's computers to get the jokes. Computers can still be complicated and frustrating, and the Internet still contains a lot of pointless junk. The book is very funny, in the typical Dave Barry style. I would have rated it much higher, if not for the short story at the end. It is just terrible. It seems like Dave was taking a creative writing course and was assigned to write a story in the second person point of view (""you"" do this, ""you"" say that). The ""you"" in the story is a suburban woman with a boring job/husband/life. ""You"" discover Internet ""chat"" and fall in love online with a guy using the alias RayAdverb, and anagram for Dave Barry. Its creepy and not funny, and it drags an otherwise entertaining book to a disappointing conclusion."
4,DTS is worth,"I was quite unsure about how would a DTS recording sound. I bought this title to try, and I was quite impressed. Besides the spatial image, which was very good but not impressive, the quality of sound and the excellent clarity shocked me. As a personal experience, I would say: I've finally heard how triangles sound."
2,Disappointed,"There are a few things one would expect when buying a guitar case. One thing is a little covered pocket to keep extra strings, string winder, picks, etc. The other is that the lining doesn't fall out when you open the case. That's right. The inner styrofoam liner fell down, out of the case when I opened it. Spend a little more cash and get a good case. This one is just too cheap."
5,No Regrets,"This cd is awesome, to say the least, if you are a HIM fan, this is the only cd (that i know of) that you can get the slow version of one of their best songs ""Beautiful"". Don't hesitate, i did and like 3 days after i ordered it there was only 3 in stock, so buy it now..."
4,Great compilation but missing some songs. . . .,"This compilation is great for CKY, HIM, BAM Fans or anyone else who enjoyed the movie. It has the songs written by Brandon (Dico) like ""Im breaking into your house. . ."" etc -- but it is missing some of the rare HIM songs that are played throughout the movie. So, if you are looking for those you need to watch the end credits of the movie to get more info on those, sadly =("
4,Secrets of the Dead: Catastrophe,"This video comprises 2 segments. The first investigates 3 possible scenarios for world-wide decline/problems starting in the 6th century. This portion is very scientifically oriented. The second argues that it was a volcano and then proceeds to give arguments/evidence to support that theory with the related consequences that follow. This portion connects the history to the science. For use as a history class resource, the second portion works best and easily fits within a 55 minute class time with time for an introduction and wrap-up. It covers topics including the Byzantine empire, Mongols, Maya, Britain, and rise of Islam."
4,Ups and Downs,"This episode makes an interesting argument about a possible cause for the collapse of the Minoan empire and produces some compelling evidence to back the claims. It's certainly not presented as hard science, and the show suffers at times for the prerequisite theatrical devices found in pretty much all made-for-television documentaries of this sort, but the basic idea is worth a listen and maybe looking into deeper to see what the greater academic community has to say on the matter."
2,The History of Protestants,"I was underwhelmed, largely because I was expecting something about the ancient texts, the gnostic scriptures, and the sources of what became the bible. Instead, this primarily is about the battles between Anglo Protestants and Catholics in the middle ages and Renaissance."
3,x10 Alarm glitchy,"It took a long time for me to get this product to work properly. This item would sometimes ring for no reason, and on occasion not stop ringing. My chime was set to ring by a motion detector, and it would sometimes not ring when it was suppose to. It took trying it plugged in several different locations before it worked properly (and strangely a power outage after which it seemed to start working correctly). Its been a couple of months now and no problems. It is a little expensive for what it does, but it works and I am happy if not thrilled with it."
2,Another Disappointment,I read someone else's review that said thisproduct was disappointingly not as good asits prececessors but ordered it anyway. Thatwas a mistake. Sounds crumby compared tomy old ones and is not as loud.
1,Low chime volume that you can not adjust,Unit chime tone is so low hardly worth using. Also ordred four from amazon. All have the same problem. Do not buy this product
5,A Must Have Tool,This Is a <ust Have Tool For Ervery One Who Works At Home Great Priceing To. Quick Delivery.
1,"Cheap, but still no t worth it","I had a new one that my wife purchased for me. What a nightmare. It was impossible to follow a line, straight or curved with it. I finally bought a different jig saw and am very happy with it. I don't even want to give it to anyone for free b/c its such a horrible tool"
5,What a great idea,"Who doesn't have a mag lite?I use this as my bore light, for cleaning/inspecting firearms.It works, and it's very bright on an LED, 2AA maglite."
1,Not worth the money,"This looks like a great adapter but is not well made and does not work well at all. I attached this adapter to Maglite two-cell AA flashlight with new batteries and was very disappointed in the amount of transmitted light. The flashlight alone produces a very bright light. BUT the Nite Ize fiber optic adapter transmits only a very small fraction of that light. A close look at the construction gives some hints as to why. The fiber optic cable looks like is was cut with a chainsaw, the cut is very rough and some of the outer cover is bent over the fiber itself. In addition, there is no mechanism to focus any of the flashlights output into the optical fiber - so what you get is about 1/50th (or less) of the output of the flashlight going down the fiber!I guess I was hoping for something more useful, but for 6 bucks I got something I will likely never use."
4,Another Remastering snafu,"When London took over factory records & decided to reissue the DC back catalogue, expediency won out over quality. The reissues were dumped onto the market rather quickly, perhaps to assure their release (as London wasn't doing too well). While it's nice to add bonus tracks, it would have been better to add the non-LP material to the album it best fit. In this case, one (long) track has been deleted from the original album along w/ audience noise, in order to accommodate bonus tracks (studio recordings, one a remix). The original Japanese factory pressing was of excellent sound quality & captured the 70+ minute performance extremely well, including details of movement on the stage. Given that the performance was less technologically driven than the added material, these bonus tracks feel quite intrusive tacked on to the end."
4,A truly enjoyable read ...,"NINE YEARS IN THE SADDLE is a story about the life and times of Dud Lee, how he survived during the depression, bootlegging and hunting mountain lions in Chiricahua Mountains in Southeast New Mexico, and his time punching cows. It's the authors way of telling a story of a man he'd longed to know, and did so after their airport meeting when his father was eighty-one years old. A truly enjoyable read -- a story that will make you laugh and at the same time tug at your heart strings."
2,Not suitable for children,"A few of the poems in this book are humorous, but several of them are extremely depressing. It is not a book I would choose for children."
5,Very very nice paper,"This isn't exactly as presented....it's actually better. It doesn't have quite the slick finish the product shown has, but it's a thicker paper. This works just fine for scrapbooking, etc. I'm very happy!!!"
2,hp presentation paper,The outer box was fine and sturdy but the individual boxes of paper inside were falling apart. I couldn't pick up a box without the paper falling out. It looked like the boxes were a hundred years old or had been wet at one time. The inside of the paper box was gritty and the paper itself is gritty. I would have to wipe each page off to be sure it would nt smear my photos. Very disappointed. I will buy different paper. I should return all but won't take the time and effort. That why I ordered on line to reduce time and effort.HP Premium Presentation Paper
2,Not the same as the Old HP presentation,"I bought two of these thinking I was ordering the same HP presentation paper 120g that I have been very happy with before, but found out HP has changed the paper. This paper does not have the same coating as the previous one and color are not as bright, vivid as the old one. Basically what you are getting here is an average everyday printing paper that is a bit thicker. That's all. I am disappointed and will never buy this paper again."
3,Good quality,"The HP Premium Presentation Paper works fine with my Canon Pixma--provides nice brightness and whiteness, but not card weight. Colors tend to be vibrant on standard settings and I've been pleased with the quality for everyday color proofing for text and image layouts."
4,Good stock paper for greeting cards,"This is a value-pack presentation paper just right for your greeting card creations, even with photo inclusions which all my greeting cards have. Color keeps well from HP Photosmart C6350 printer."
2,Really?,"I dont understand how this is considered ""presentation"" paper. I wouldnt present anything professionally with this paper. Its like regular printer paper but just thicker. Youre better of with something else.Also, Im upset with Amazon because the paper was estimated to arrive on the 18th, but I just got it today. SLOW shipping!!!! The packaging was weak and ruined some of the paper."
1,How insulting,"I believe Dave Barry is trying to be funny, but I find this book completely insulting ... to guys, to women, and to his readers. I wish I had known the kind of language he uses and how crass he can be. Definitely would not have bought this one."
3,I'm hooked on Barry!,This was the first book by Dave Barry that I ever read. I loved it. He really captures the funny fundementals of what it means to be a guy. Now I'm hooked on Dave Barry and plan to read his other titles.
2,Incomplete guide,"This book by Dave Barry who is usually very funny, was a disappoint. Not very funny and not at all informative. A disappointment."
2,predictable and unfunny after the first chapter,starts with a bang and then fizzles out.rent a blue-collar comedy tour dvd instead.
5,all in good laugh-out-loud fun,"For pure funniness, it's hard to beat Dave Barry and this book is not exception. Open to any page and you'll find something silly, hilarious and often offbeat on the subject of relationships with women, sports, do-it-yourselfing, public rest rooms, driving and the testosterone theory. In-short, any guy thing at all.Guys, it appears (as opposed to men) have never grasped the ""Basic Human Moral Code, which I believe was invented by women millions of years ago when all the guys were out engaging in some other activity, such as seeing who could burp the loudest."" A book that can be enjoyed equally by guys and gals."
3,It was ok,"Funny at times. I found most of it to be rehashed through the ages, but there was some originality to it."
1,Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys,This book is horrible - not at all funny. Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
5,Laugh-out-loud funny,"This book had me laughing by the Dedication. It had me crying by the Introduction. His sense of humor is not for everyone, but for those whose funny bone it does strike, this is a book you must read - whether you are a man, a woman or a ""guy"". Just be sure to read it in the comfort of your own home, because you will be laughing out loud."
4,This hits too close to home!,"Okay, this is a humor book, written by a humor writer. Don't look for deep understanding, exhaustive research, or politically correct statements, viewpoints, or stories.With that caveat...For many guys, this book hits closer to home than you might expect. Barry uses the technique of exaggeration to bring attention to the world of the guy, which he argues (successfully) is not the same as the world of the man. ""Guyness"" is not ""manliness."" It involves more genetic guy-wiring, multiple remote controls, free-flowing testosterone, and tools.Guaranteed to bring a chuckle out of 95% of men, 90% of women, and 100% of guys, who will look at it as a ""how-to"" book.And don't take any of Barry's ""guyness"" quotient tests unless you are guy enough to handle the results!"
5,Dave's Best Book Ever,"I think I've read 95% of Dave's books, and this is the one he was born to write. It's not just hilarious, it's wise.I recommended about five years ago that evolutionary psychologists take Dave seriously as a source of brilliant insights into gender differences. I was pleased to see that MIT cognitive scientist Steven Pinker's new bestseller ""The Blank Slate"" quotes Barry at length and praises him: ""Every generation has its designated jokers, from Shakespearean fools to Lenny Bruce, who give voice to truths that are unmentionable in polite society. Today, part-time humorists like [Kurt] Vonnegut, and full-time ones like Richard Pryor, Dave Barry, and the writers of The Onion, are continuing that tradition."""
4,From a big Dave Barry fan,"I love Dave Barry's writing. This one is short and sweet, the perfect size. He talks about the difference between men, boys, and the topic of the book: guys! He really puts down the male, and being one myself, I can not blame him. He discusses the simple-minded-ness of guys and their stupidity. For instance, he talks about a true story where a guy siphons off gasoline with a vacuum cleaner (just picture the result of such stupidity). Of course he picks the extremes of guys, but bashes the whole gender for acting like these few. It is absolutely hilarious. This was my second favorite Dave Barry book, right next to Dave Barry's Money Secrets."
5,holy (chocolate) cow!,"When my five year old daughter was asked what she wanted for christmas, she replied, ""A drumset and a chocolate cow."" That didn't seem like an unreasonable request, but I wasn't sure where to find a chocolate cow.Amazon, of course! The chocolate cow was delivered promptly, and was nicely packaged so as not to fall apart during shipping. The detail was good, and it was gone in a hurry so I imagine it tasted good too! Thank you Amazon for having those off the cuff items to make for Merry Christmases."
1,Has anyone been ab;le to get the CD to run on Vista?,My son's entire class has been unable to get the CD to run. All the kids have Vista. Has anyone been able to get it to run on Vista?
3,Not universal Remote,"I think this setup is well worth its price. I actually own the 990mx which comes with the DVD player. I have no complaints other than the remote. It is not a universal remote. I have tried this with my Toshiba 32 TV, a Sharp 27 TV, a sanyo VCR, and none will work. I have contacted support, and they said tough luck, the device is not guarenteed to work with other devices."
4,wonderfully more than meets the eye,"The well-written story of a woman, a man, and a VERY determined cat, and a little more than that. While George, an utterly dogmatic (sorry, George!) and deeply insecure part-Siamese wins the heart of Holly (the narrator), her husband Ben is more skeptical (""cats have no personality""). They move to a small island to begin a new life and the story follows them through the first year of their struggle. But there's a little more to it than that, because each of the main characters (with the exception, possibly, of the Dharma-cat who arrives halfway through) is struggling with both a need to let go of the past and a deep hope/desire that has never been fulfilled. The story of how they begin to do this gives this story an underlying strength and interest -- but for the devotees of cats, there's plenty to keep you grinning, and some good historical and factual info to add to one's store."
5,The Best computer game ever,"Big Game Hunter 4 is a great computer game. I could play it all day long.It's all very simple but fun.There's a place where you can hunt deer,turkey,and bear in a shooting range and the animals pop up and you try to shoot at them,but of course they are fake.The other choice you have that you can do is video hunting.It sounds stupid but it is awesome.What you do is you try to shoot deer,turkey,and bear but it lookes like it's in real life.It moves and jumps like a real animal.But watch out for the animals that it says not to shoot like rabbit,and doe.So I advise you to think about getting this game.It's awesome."
1,Euthanize these 'cats',"It was some years ago that I read one or two of the ""Cat Who..."" books, and surely they must have had more to recommend them than the current installment, ""The Cat Who Tailed a Thief."" Otherwise, I'd have remembered never to pick up another. The NY Times reviewer is wrong about this one; not even the ""kitty porn"" is sufficient to compensate for the lack of suspense, character development, and decent dialogue. The evildoers are evident in the first chapter, yet by the end nothing is revealed of the 'why' or 'how' of their crimes. Two people die in the book, for heaven's sake, and more exposition is given to the petty theft of a doll and other knickknacks. I'd recommend that cat lovers like myself look to authors such as Cleveland Amory for their feline fix, and seek their mysteries elsewhere"
4,THE CAT WHO... is fun to be with!,"As a fan of The Cat Who.... I was not surprised to once again meet familiar characters, weather, towns and CATS in another Whodunnit which keeps you reading to the very last page without too much gore and violence and lots of smiles."
2,Not up to Ms. Braun's subtle humor and masterful writing,"I have read every one of the preceding books in this series and loved them all. Ms. Braun has a wonderful sense of pace, character, plot and subtle humor that is completely missing from this book. I am unable to read beyond the first chapter because the writing is pedestrian and feels to me like someone's notes for a novel, rather than the carefully crafted final version. Ms. Jackson has always drawn me in right away with her special tone and storytelling ability. This current volume completely lacks all of the qualities that have made me a faithful follower of Koko and his chosen person Qwilleran. Disappointment only begins to describe my reaction to this book."
2,what a mistake,"Yes, it was definitely used, VERY used. Came on time, however. I was looking for an audio book and chose that category, so this must have snuck in there. Order says ""book"" so my mistake. You'll want to be more careful than I was when shopping for audio books (which I do all the time). Rats. Total waste of $5 (book plus shipping)."
1,Sugar Coated Gobbledy Gook,I should have known better. I was expecting an honest and forthright book outlining the real story behind the Osmond family and their struggles. All this book is is an attempt to further promote their religious faith. Hardly worth the paper it is written on. I read not even half of it and had to close the pages. I rated it one out of sympathy.
1,does not fit!,"I received this item today and was appalled to find that the iAudio X5L will not fit into this leather case.Even if you work hard at pushing the iAudio down into the case, the case is too small too latch shut and the iAudio will be nearly impossible to remove. I'm returning mine today -- don't let this happen to you."
5,BEST DORIS DAY CD I HAVE.,"IF YOU LIKE DORIS DAY, AS I DO, THIS IS THE BEST CD I THINK. GREAT MUSIC, AND SONGS. I LOVE IT!"
5,One of Doris Day's very best albums,"""Love Me or Leave Me,"" a huge best-seller when it was released with the movie back in the mid-50s, remains one of Doris Day's best albums. The arrangements are lush, her voice is at its best, and the songs are some of the lasting standards of the 20s, with a couple of newer tunes written for the movie. Her versions of ""It All Depends on You"" and ""Mean to Me"" are especially memorable. A great singer at her peak."
1,Love Me or Leave Me - Doris Day,Really wanted this CD in the worst way but unfortunately it wouldn't play on my Sony equipment so I had to return it.
4,SONJA HENIE AND JOAN DAVIS IN HIT MUSICAL,"MY LUCKY STAR 1938 was one of Sonja Henie`s biggest hits. In addition to her wonderful displays on ice, Joan Davis made a great and wonderful comic impact as Henie`s roomie. In addition, Fox cast British import Richard Greene as Henie`s loveinterest, Billy Gilbert for comic relief and Buddy Ebsen for some dancin`a n d comic turns as well. I have always wondered about the fuss made of the Astaire-Rogers films at RKO in the 30s. The Astaire at MGM was much better. So for the 30s, the Sonja Henie films are those I would reckomend. They are truly great thanks to glossy production values and great supporting casts..."
2,Subtutles,"I would have added this DVD to my collection, unfortunately, the one & only subtitles is in Spanish on this DVD and I can't read Spanish - although I wished I could.. Subtitles are useful when the speech / dialogue is at times difficult to catch."
2,"if you're a fan of the Hulk, forget it","I thought the movie was good but as a huge fan of the hulk, I was severely disappointed that he only had a cameo in this one and even that was a meaningless scene. i guess maybe they figured the hulk would destroy the aliens to quickly and there wouldn't be much of a movie."
2,Weak Character Development,"Nothing in the story really made me care about any of the characters. Like many other action movies, there are parts wher you wonder if one or more of the characters is going to make it. Unfortionately there wasn't enough character development to make you care if they make it or not."
3,Ultimate Avengers 2,"Our house loves the Ultimate Avengers, so naturally we had to get the 2nd movie. It is worth the price I payed, but truly does not compare to the first one. It is adequate to have the next in the line of movies, but I would not give it as high of a rating as I would that first one. Still worth owning, still worth watching and still got the greatest character line up. If you like Avengers, you'll like this movie."
2,It was bad,I don't know what to say but it was bad. I got confused with the story. The animation was blah. It was just blah. I did not give it 1 star because it was not the worst thing I've watched. I regret buying this movie. Oh well.
3,Another good one from Marvel,"The action is good, though the story seems like a retread of the first one. Also, Captain America's character is a bit more neurotic in this one, which is annoying. The Hulk is once again pretty much an after-thought, since he is a factor only at the end. However, that being said, the story holds together well enough for you to care what happens, and I recommend watching it more than once to get the full impact. Not especially appropriate for the under-10 group, but tweens will like it a lot."
4,Great flick...,The first Ultimate Avengers was a good intro for the major players in the story. The second allowed the viewer to get a better feel for the story itself. It was certainly worth the money.
1,Another terribe Marvel animated movie,Animation was terrible. Plot was stupid.Poorly animated. A complete waste of time.Aweful!
3,The first movie is better,"This animated movie has an excellent drawing but the history is just lame, is too slow, because they introduce the black panther and I think that he is not an interesting character, the first movie was really good this one was so so."
4,great Marvel team-up movie,"This sequel shows that the aliens from the 1st movie are not quite defeated. All the heroes are equally highlighted, although I was hoping to see The Hulk a bit more."
3,More of the same,"The first Ultimate Avengers movie was decent, but ended just when things were really starting to pick up. I was hoping the sequel would be better, but it's pretty much more of the same. The alien invaders are back, and they're still kinda generic and uninteresting. Voice acting is decent, but I never really got attached to these heroes like I wanted to. I suppose the looser guidelines on violence should appeal to older fans like me, but when the story is bland like it is here, the violence just comes off as a forced attempt to be 'edgy.' There was one twist in the ending though that caught me by surprise.I wish they'd made this a full tv series, giving the creative team time to work out the kinks. UA2 will give you enough of a superhero fix, but it won't leave you satisfied."
2,sophomore slump,"The first Ultimate Avengers was awesome. I was really looking forward to the 2nd one, especially since the Black Panther was going to be featured. I have to say that I was disappointed. The story was not engaging and I expected more from a sequel. The action animation was not riveting, at least not to Marvel Comics standards. The story didn't flow very well which leads me to blame the over-all direction. Hard to say what they could've done to make this one better. All I wanted was more of what was in the first edition but I think they fell short."
1,wrong language.,I thought i bought a movie in English for my son. Turned out wrong. If i knew it was Italian i wouldnt of bought it. Too late.
3,Better than most live action Marvel films,The Black Panther is the new king of his people after the alien general killed his father who was the Black Panther and King before him. He must team up with the Avengers to protect his people from an alien attack. While Bruce Banner is heald in captivity by an evil scientist that sprays him with gas to calm him down to prevent him from turning into the Hulk. While Thor has a vision of the other Avengers dieing and must stop that from happening.What's impressive about the movie is that everyone has something to do and all the characters are well developed. While you know if they made a live action movie it would be a big mess and critics would probably hate it as much as the Fantastic Four. This is an entertaining and surprisingly often violent film. If they make another one I wouldn't mind it having an actual comic book villian though. This is good but enough with the alien attack plot.
2,King Kirby Spinning in His Grave,"I liked the first Ultimate Avengers DVD. I thought it would make a fine jumping off point for a franchise. With Avengers 2, a leap is taken, but backwards. I'm not sure who their audience is supposed to be. It's got way too many ""relationship issues"" for kids and the adults will be turned off by lazy continuity and average-at-best animation.I can appreciate the need to make a movie for the masses, but have a little respect for the history. The costumes we grew up with have all been streamlined,(removing Cap's wings? Please.) and the characters are all cliches. Not to mention the re-ethnicizing of Nick Fury and the Black Panther apparently raiding Batman's closet. All in all a real disappointment."
1,Too Violent and Definitely too bloody,"I'm a great fan of the avengers, but after seeing the Ultimate Avengers, I was hurt. I thought it was much too graphic for children. Furthermore the story resembles the pilot series of the ""Justice League"". I expected better from Marvel.I guest it's just the signs of the times. I mean kids are so accustomed to seeing blood and gore in their video games, why not their cartoon series, right? No wonder, some have no qualms about pulling guns on peers and shooting them in the head.I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD to children. I would be doing a disservice to society."
1,poor,Terribly dissapointed after buying avengers part 1. Don't expect to see more than 1 minute of the Hulk in this one. Very poor.
2,A Parent's Review for Ultimate Avengers 2,"I am a cartoon, and a comic fan. I have been for years. I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do. The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch. But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far. There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers. Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room. I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film. For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often. For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again."
3,not bad,"This isn't bad material. The team of superheros that first came to DVD seems a bit watered down now with less plot development and more action. The story introduces an old Lee/Kirby hero called Black Panther which first premiered in Fantastic Four 54 I believe. Of course origins must be altered and so is this one but it ties in with bringing the Avengers back for more mayham. The Hulk is left as a cameo at the end and mostly the story belongs to Black Panther, Captain America, and a whiny Henry Pym. Overall not a bad fare but could have been so much better with a more developed script that focused more on character and less on action but that's just me. I want to point out the extra features including the gag reel. It's hysterical with a running joke about Stark Enterprises restaurant. The best part was when ""Hulk want no ribs"" but you have to see it to believe it."
3,"A trimmed, soft-edged version of the Ultimates...","This is the second ""Ultimate Avengers"" film, adapted from the comic of the same name. Unlike the ""standard"" Avengers comic, the Ultimates offers more realistic and gritty stories.Sadly, alot of that hard-edged story telling is missing from the animated films (and where the heck is Hawkeye??! My personal pet peeve..), no wife-beating, no wife-beater beating, no blood, no sex - no Shield Heli-Carriers (why? I have no idea, they would look great in a movie). The movie does have some of the elements present in the comic and I liked the addition of the Vibranium/Wakanda plotline. I always thought that the Black Panther was pretty cool.Who is the audience for this movie? Fans of the comic won't be too thrilled by the milquetoast adaptation of the comic, but this movie is too violent for kids.Ultimate Avengers 2 is worth seeing, but I hope the next one is alot better and more faithful to the comic."
4,Ultimate Avengers 2,"If you loved, still love, Marvel comics, this is for you. The excellent animation brings the still images of the page to life. Although I don't think that it was quite as good as the first, Ultimate Avengers, it is still well worth purchasing."
4,Not too bad ... and entertaining!,"I saw the first one so I know what to expect. It is not a surprise some of the darker storylines, particularly the part about Hank & Janet, were toned down since they probably need the kid market.Given that, the film is actually pretty entertaining. The animation is a bit better than the first one although still not up to par to the best JLU. I like the characters. They are a bit more edgy than the DC super heroes.The plot is ok and I like the addition of the Black Panther. I also like my anime with a little blood and gore ... refreshing from TV stuff although UA2 is no where close to Japanese anime in the area of portraying violence."
1,Missing images,"I agree with the other favourable reviews on the content of the book. I have always enjoyed De Botton's writing.However, the bulk of the images are missing, and the ones that are present are of low quality.The images are essential to the discussion in the text, so a very disappointing Kindle experience.Buy the real book instead."
5,Important and Fun Book!!,Alain De Botton is among the most important thinkers of our day. This book explores design and human values far beyond the realm of a typical treatise on architecture.
4,Insightful work,"After reading the author's travel book, I knew that he would have some great insights to offer for this unexpected combination of subjects. I got this book for a friend who is into philosophy and architecture; they found it quite interesting and enjoyable."
3,If you read just one book about architecture...,"If you read just one book about architecture, this might make sense or feel complete, but it really restates a lot of earlier work that others have done, and misses a lot of possibilities. For example, in the book, the author wishes for ""a dictionary"" to help explain things that make good architecture. This is exactly what architect Christopher Alexander created 30 years ago in ""A Pattern Language"", and related books. (He called it a ""language"", not a ""dictionary"") Sarah Susasnka's ""The Not So Big House"" covers similar ground for residential architecture.The photography of this book does shine, though. This book provides complete visual documentation for the words on the page."
1,Not a page turner & not deep analysis,"I have read most of the customer reviews listed on Amazon - unfortunately only after I finished reading the book. I am impressed with the quality of authors of those reviews. I can not say I am knowledgeable about architecture. Yet that was precisely why I bought this book. To get more insight.What I found, however was a compilation of one man's opinions about architecture. Whether he likes this or that.I am finding De Botton a hard to read man. I think there is too much trying to make ""perfect"" sentences. However because it's not done on a perfect level, it gets tiring to read. I contemplated a lot whether I should stop the book after mere 50 pages. But I had to finish - God only knows why - so I pushed myself. There were maybe few points which I got from the book. But all in all it was a waste of my time to finish it. Sorry Alain!."
2,Falling short in conveying the message,"Although I sympathize very much with the intentions of the author in educating us on some basic elements of architecture very much appreciated by many of us, I find the shortcomings of the book annoing. Such a book would benefit tremendously by having more and better illustrations. Also at times I find the text too elaborate and off track, especially in the first chapters."
1,"Not as ""new"" as they said it was.","Got this book for my brother who is away from home (about 2 and half hours away) at college and his first year and he is studying to be a Architectic and I thought this book would be great for him to read. He comes home and I'm excited that he gets to open it and once he does he flips though the pages and either water or coffee stain on my book and thought the pages. So disappointed and sad that he loved it but it wasn't as ""new"" as they claim it to be. Asked the seller for my $$ back and I did and they let me keep the book. That's great but he didn't want and now I have it. Most importantly I was embrassed and disappointed it came like that, i should of opened the package myself but what's the fun in that? When it's a gift for someone close to you?"
2,This Is a Nutty Book,"I'm glad I bought it, and I'm glad I read it.It's such an odd piece, really. The author is primarily known as a fiction writer. So all of those novelist word picture tricks are used to pass his thoughts on to us about how architecture goes about making us happy.The person who recommended this book to me must ride on a higher mental plane than I do. I didn't think the premise needed documentation."
1,How to write nothing about something,"This book is full of fluff. Fluff can be considered somebody's style, but if you want solid architecture analysis with philosophical undertones (what this book ideally could be), do yourself a favor and pick up a different book.My suggestion: The Old Way of Seeing by Jonathan Hale"
3,"Very light indeed, but not unpleasant.","This is Diet-Philosophy, entirely without fat and maybe without grey matter too. Anecdotes are narrated competently and there might be an underlying thesis. Something along the lines of ""we are fascinated by the design of our immediate surroundings because we unconsciously believe that our immediate environment impacts us: our house will make us a better person, we think"". Well, well, this is of course debatable, but not entirely false. Is it interesting and worth your time? If you're stuck in an airport, I'd say, probably."
2,"Book itself is lovely, thoughtful - kindle edition is poorly edited, distracting.","I really have enjoyed reading the book and would say more about it except that the Kindle edition has at least one glaring typo in each chapter. This makes it very difficult to read because as you know, the mind gets ejected out of a passage each time it comes across something foreign to it. I love my Kindle but this seems to be a common problem with ebooks. The publishers seem to just paste the copy from the book to the ebook without looking at it, meaning artifacts that made sense on the fixed page such as hyphens still exist out of context on a reader that is much less static. If this were a printed book we'd demand our money back and I might just do that with the digital. $9 for a book that doesn't physically exist except as ones and zeros... well, I'll say that it better be perfect to command that price."
2,archi student,"Although I would certainly agree that De Botton is a talented and captivating writer, I feel that ""The Architecture of Happiness"" falls well short of a serious examination of architecture and its ideals. This book is perfect for anyone who possesses a casual interest in architecture. The more serious architecture student or architecture aficionado, however, will find little valuable content in this book. Some of the conclusions that De Button reaches are not well thought out (and frankly a waste of time to consider critically) in that the book tends to focus upon superficial aspects of architecture. De Button should not be mistaken for a serious critic or architecture historian. This book is not a good read for an architecture student seeking well-researched theory or an in depth understanding of our relationship with the built environment."
3,I Was Expecting Something Different,More of thesis on the nature of happiness than the architecture primer I was expecting. That would be fine except it reads a little too much like a thesis too. The photos compliment the text nicely though.
4,Du-Ha Storage Ford F250,"This storage bin is a bit pricey, but it fits well under the back seat and provides much needed storage space. It prevents items from sliding all around the back floor. I would by another. The vendor sent it promptly."
5,Duran Duran: The Astronaut has landed!,"Fantastic album. What a treat having the original Fab Five back together after 20-some years! Instant classics such as What Happens Tomorrow, Bedroom Toys, Nice!, Taste the Summer and Still Breathing.We get the funky return of early-eighties Duran funk on this one, especially with the happening basslines of Taste the Summer and Nice! Still Breathing has some of the most meaningful and haunting lyrics of any Duran Duran song. It hits close to home and it's good to see the band putting more emotional feeling into their music. It's classic Duran Duran, but their sound has matured for the better.What a feeling to still have Duran Duran making awesome new music! It has certainly helped make my own life journey all the more enjoyable."
2,What Is All The Fuss About !!,"DuranDuran are a good pop group but let's face it, with the exception of RIO, the tracks on a Duran album that are not hits are generally just mediocre. Astraunaut is no exception. They deliver big-time on Reach Up for the Sunrise & Bedroom Toys but other than that, this album is a non-event. Both album and singles didn't sell well on release...I bought it because for some strange reason, I always buy their albums (good or bad)..Maybe, I am hoping that they will deliver a classic album like RIO one more time..guess I'll just have to wait for the next album."
3,"poor follow-up to ""The Healing Blade""","Sylvester wrote a fascinating book a few years back called ""The Healing Blade"" about neurosurgeons. With this latest book promising more of the same and also to tell how crises spur docs onto new discoveries, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Boy, was I disappointed!!This book is largely about the politics that surround what may turn out to be a new field, intensive care in an ICU for neurology patients. It also covers how medical researchers go about their business.There is little that explains what examining patients tells docs about how the brain functions. There is almost none of the drama of his previous book, where patients are followed in detail and you learn how neurosurgeons evaluate and treat conditions.Its almost like the author took a big step backwards in his writing skills, this book being nowhere near the captivating story his previous book told. I was disappointed, and I think you will be too."
3,Average,"If you want to see Batman fight Judge Dredd, you'll find this book disappointing (unless you think a three- or four-panel scuffle constitutes as ""fight""). You'll also find this book disappointing if you're hoping to see Batman and Judge Dredd team up, because they don't. Instead, Batman teams up with Anderson to go after Judge Death, who has teamed up, rather randomly I think, with the Scarecrow (surely the Scarecrow and Judge Fear would have been a more logical combination?) It's not an activally bad comic, but it's certainly not a great one."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The first par of an inter-company crossover stunts, really. This part is set in Gotham City granite jawed lawmen with little tolerance for outsiders with strange abilities in their cities, clash, as Batman finds Judge Dredd in his town, and wants to know why the hell he is there.Posturing and snarling follows."
3,Interesting ideas on women gleaned from medical science,"Angier ""speculates"" (in the manner of Carl Sagan) from scientific knowledge about women's physiology and behavior to reach some very interesting and novel conclusions on sexuality, the relationship between men and women, sex bias in medical research and medicine, the evolution of the human species and its impact on sex roles in society. Fantastic reading for courses in general science, women's studies, anthropology, political and all the other social sciences, while still making for entertaining reading and fuel for many interesting conversations between sexes."
2,Poor Packaging and Very low Grade,"The quality of Marshalls Creeks Rosemary is less than ideal. There is more stem than rosemary in the container which makes for a very rough measurement and stem pieces throughout food. If you don't mind a little rough stem then Marshalls Creeks is just for you. Also the ""sealed"" container is not really ""sealed at all"" I had spider webs and mold (somehow) in some other herbs I purchased from them."
3,So far so good,I like this product so far and have had no problems with it. I just wish the iron level was higher and the B12 was lower per capsule. Its a bit lopsided.
5,terrific.,"Doesn't cause stomach upset or digestive problems. The Gel pills are large, yet pretty easy to swallow. I'll buy again."
1,Poor Customer Service F-,"Watch was used,item had issues from the time of purchase, called customer service and felt I was talking to somebody from their house inside a garage, kids crying and dogs barking.No solution was given, send me to manufacture to repair a new watch...no feeling the Amazon deal anymore"
5,"Gloria, indeed!","Listening to this CD, especially to ""Gloria"", in a quiet setting is an experience close to rapture. I've played this song for numerous people and they all have the same reaction; incredible! The harmonies, the musicianship, all add up to a musical experience par excellence."
4,A different kind of Christmas music. Classics done with a twist.,"Eclectic collection, performed by various artists, in a somewhat offbeat style. ""The First Noel"", by Spencer Brewer, the best, most powerful version of a Christmas Carol, I've ever heard. Worth the price, alone."
3,Nowhere near as good as Collection 1,"This collection is much longer than the first (makes sense, because Collection 1 was released when vinyl still occupied almost half the market), but nowhere near as innovative or varied. Many of the selections on this one are nothing short of boring, especially when compared both to Collection 1 and the first 2 Mannheim Steamroller Christmas releases.Collection 2 is undeniably pretty at times and is big on quantity, but its quality was a huge disappointment for me after being so enthralled by Collection 1.Warning: Best not play it in a moving car, as it could be sleep-inducing."
3,Depression glass knob set,Beautiful and does the job just great. The issue I have is the set (lock) screws that hold the knob to the through shaft have tapped out holes. The quality control of these tapped holes is poor. One was too close to the edge of the metal and only had partial threads. I would buy it again no problem.
3,His show separates him from others with a unique style,Although he shows a very unique style and talent he loses some of it's luster in predictability.
1,Bad Quality No Warranty With Amazon,"This unit was shipped to me bad out of the box. I missed the return window to send it back to Amazon, which is my fault, but Behringer won't fix it under warranty because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. So, I bought it brand new and will have to spend $$ to get it repaired even though it's all of 6 weeks old and has never even booted up and initialized correctly once."
3,Tough to use with small scopes,"I have and ETX-105 with a tripod mount. This objective requires a very solid mount and a lot of stability. I could not get it to focus at all with a 2x Barlow. Excellent for near observing, but the focusing problems made deep space a problem."
1,Disappointing,"Buy this video if you need to watch 60 minutes of groin kicks followed with an elbow strike - That's it - sum total of this worthless DVD. Compounding the absurdity, each sequence is repeated in slow motion 3TIMES!!! If you removed the slow motion replays, the actual text of the video would probably run for 15 minutes max."
5,"too slim, too good","each new cd just gets better and better. great sounds and some brilliant new tracks. getting quite a collection of too slim and the gang, they really know how to pump out a great sound"
2,Not too bad,The book was not like i expected. i thought they were going to go a little more in detail about the lives of the Ramsey's. It was a little boring to me and it dragged a little. But there were a few interesting parts as well.
2,Out To Soon!,"I remember when this book came out because I was fascinated by the case and bought everything regarding the murder. I am a fan of true crime books and Carlton Smith who is one of the better crime writers today. Anyway, the case is still unsolved after 10 years. Sadly, Patsy Ramsey died of cancer last year. The Grand Jury decided that there was not enough evidence to convict the Ramseys. That means, they were not involved in her murder in my opinion. I think the book came out too soon and was cashing in on a murder case that remains unsolved about a beautiful, vivacious, beauty queen with her whole life ahead of her."
2,Disappointed with the quality,"I am disappointed with the quality.Pros: Soft leather, nice interior, large enough to hold big piecesCons: Pieces fell off after the first week of light usage. I cannot repair it, as the inside is covered with a fabric. Overall, poorly constructed"
5,Teriffic Handbag,"I love this handbag. The leather is high quality and it has room to spare, with a comfortable shoulder strap drop. The hardware is substantial, but it doesn't make the bag too heavy. This bag is a keeper."
4,Trianing Aid,"A ""must have"" for the begining pilot trainee. Note: There is also a version for high wing aircraft. Buy it!"
5,Surprisingly beautiful!,"I have to say I did not expect the film to be so raw, sexy, emotional, and meaningful... judging by the previews. But it totally captivated me... I loved every bit of it!"
2,Superficial and lacking in substance...,"I rented this movie because I had heard good things about it in the media. But it was a sad disappointment. While the story had potential for deep character development, the movie failed utterly to do so. Instead, it was plagued with superficiality. The director seemed more interested in the over-abundance of sex scenes (just add some cheesy music, and this movie easily becomes soft-porn) than with the lives of his characters outside the bedroom."
2,Ugh!,"A bad version of Love Story. It must have been painful to even have to say some of the lines that were written. I never knew where the story was going or where it had been. Locations, time line, connections to previous events, disjointed, all a mess. It seemed to go on forever. And I actually like both of the actors in the film but it was a bad version of an wannabe ok story. How does it end, anyway?"
2,Below average.,The dvd that I received was ridiculously scratched up. I would've returned it if I didn't get the movie as inexpensive as I did or even if the parts that I was able to see (probably 45 minutes were left unscathed) were up to par. The movie itself was a letdown. A part of me is glad that it was as scratched up as it was because now I won't feel as bad when I throw it away.
2,Dull,"I was bored by the film, that I eventually gave up and switched the video off. Glad I rented it rather than saw it theatre. No sparks between main characters (actors) and story line seems to drag.Okay if you just want to see them naked."
1,rambling move,Its a movie that you want to get excited about instead it just gently pulls you along leaving you waiting for more then entire time.
4,Very good,"I don't know what I was expecting, maybe Sweet November or something, but this was a fair share better than your typical sob-love romance. Yeah, it had some of the elements of it, I mean, the gal is chronically ill, so there will be no true fairytale ending. However, this movie has a good shot of humor, and I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occassions. Definitely worth the watch, and I will share it with others."
3,Would have been better as a drama,"Love & Other Drugs started out as something like a romantic comedy. That was fine with me. Then, with Gyllenhaal and Hathaway becoming ""sex buddies"", the movie almost became a soft-core porn with all of the frontal nudity for Hathaway and rear nudity for Gyllenhaal. Then with another twist, the movie ended as a drama. I actually liked the dram spin at the end, and would have preferred that the whole movie start in this way. I would have also liked to seen it be more, like it started, as a comedy. But mixing them up like this was just a bit too confusing.Both of the main actors are excellent and believable in their characters. It just seems that the director changed course somewhere in the middle of filming."
4,Hard to pin down but above average,"The first half of this plays like many other comedies. Funny, but with everything exaggerated. People spouting side effects and contra-indications, talking faster than the FedEx guy. When Jake has his exchange with the training lady at the Pfizer meeting, I said to my friends ""they'll be in bed in the next scene"" and sure enough. The second half turns serious, almost as if to atone for part one. This is quite well done and feels authentic so even though you know what will happen it doesn't spoil anything. No problem with the nudity, but you know, the physical beauty of the actors and how Jake never has a hair out of place was a real distraction. There's a great scene where Maggie goes to a meeting of people with Parkinson's and it's like Hollywood drops in on the real world."
2,"Um, no.","Don't waste your time. Besides the fact that Jake and Anne are beautiful, the rest is pretty dumb. The worst is the ""brother"" character. Ahhh! Two great actors made a bad movie."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I know we all have different tastes and opinions.......but this movie just did not hold my attention at all. Shallow, poor story line, characters not very believable. I wasn't impressed with any part of this movie."
1,I wish I would have fallen asleep,Everything that is cute or funny about this movie is in the trailer. I felt no connection with any of the characters. Just skip it!!!
1,Bipolar,"By bipolar i mean that the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to showcase how an individual and subsequently those around her deals with a progressively debilitating disease or showcase the surface physical attractiveness of it's two stars with a backdrop of spoofing Viagra and other ""love"" enhancing prosthetics. So, as a consequence the viewers' now split personality is left wandering in a zone of ""huh?"", ""What is this movie about?""The story was neither deep enough, believable enough or focused enough to believe in it's outcome, whatever it may be, because the movie was so scattered it just ran out of time. So the viewer is left guessing about the important issue of how our protagonists would resolve care and love within the most trying days of a disease."
3,Anne Went Hathaway,"She didn't have lower her standards (again) to perform nude. There is more nudity from Ms. Hathaway in this otherwise acceptable film than she has ever done. ""Havoc"" found her 'getting her raunch on' for the first time (which some called brave, seeing as she was completely inexperienced in real life at that time). Then of course she bared herself in the 'gay interest' movie ""Brokeback Mountain"". Now comes ""Love & Other Drugs,"" in which she plays out a romance with Jake Gyllenhaal. There are numerous nude scenes, and I was struck by how cavalier Ms. Hathaway plays these scenes. It was almost as if she was truly flaunting it in a way very unbecoming of a serious young actress. I can't recommend this movie unless you are able to see an edited version."
2,poor choice,"It looked promising so I rented it from Amazon. I never got halfway through I was bored and put off by the characters. The ""brother"" was awful...the 'sister' yuck...a waste of everyone's time..the writing was poor and could have been better. 32 mins in and it was off the screen."
5,Great Movie for 18+,"Jake and Anne are Great together. Plus, Anne, well, what can I say; she really gave us a fantastic performance - a definate 10+. Loved it as much as my girl friend!"
1,Aweful film..question Amazon star ratings...,"This film is bad. Not in a, ""it was almost good"" kind of way either. Whoever is reviewing this and giving it 5 stars either didn't watch it, or was too distracted by the low impact nudity to realize they were watching a terrible film. The first 5 minutes are solid, but the film takes a turn towards goofy comedy and never comes back from cheesy Viagra jokes and a laughable attempts at drama. Hathaway's contribution of graceful beauty and nudity can only take a film so far.I know my review doesn't give a lot of insight into the film itself, but to be honest it's better that way."
2,lame ...,"Neither Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal's ability to act, nor the the abundance of gratuitous nudity and sex scenes make this mish mash of a movie worth watching. It doesn't seem to know what it's trying to be; I hated the script, didn't find the comedic aspects amusing (in fact annoying is closer to the mark) and i felt a bit embarrassed for the two main actors lending their chops to such a mess of a film trying to be everything (romcom, drama, raunchy slapstick, etc.) and ending up so lame."
3,Glad I rented it instead of buying,"This wasn't a bad movie, but definitely not one to add to the Blu Ray collection. I thought it was going to be less of a love story and more about how corrupt the pharmaceutical industry is. Always enjoy Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal."
3,disappointed,"i had high expectations for this movie. i figured with these actors it has to be great. well, i was disappointed. the acting was good as expected. i just thought it would be more comical than it was. it was predictable and it wasn't fun. like i said i expected more than what i got. my fault."
2,Big Disappointment!,"I had seen previews of this movie and was excited when it came out on DVD. However, I was so disappointed when I watched it. I did watch it all the way through hoping it would get better. To be honest it just aggravated me. I think that it had the potential to be a great movie but fail short."
2,Unconvincing love with a horrible premise,"Maybe my expectations were to high given that I was watching a love story with supposed comedic overtones. Maybe my expectations were too high given that 2 of my favorite actors were in this movie. Either way, this movie failed on many levels. I found the chemistry between Gyllenhal and Hathaway forced and unconvincing. I found the portrayal of pharaceutical representatives an accurate and disturbing look into the mid to late 90's. But I also felt like this movie glorified Drug Reps in their hay day. For a movie with comedic potential, it took itself way too seriously."
3,I think that there's a problem with the price!,"Okay, there is definitely a problem with the price listed for this item.I still give this movie 3 stars. The first half of the movie is just too harsh and cold. I enjoyed the second half much better.More on this later."
5,DVD,"I enjoyed the movie very much, has humor, love, happiness and rolls it all into one movie. I love the actors and found the movie very entertaining."
3,A movie in search of a direction,"Jake Gylenhall and Anne Hathaway are pleasing as mismatched lovers in this extremely loose adaptation of the bestselling nonfiction book. But...is it a romantic comedy? A disease of the week movie? A toothless satire of Big Pharma? The satire was doomed to fail from the get-go, what with the obvious fortune in product placement that Pfizer put into it."
4,Has anyone read the book?,"This movie is VERY loosely based on James Reidy's 2005 autobiography, Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman. The relationship with Anne Hathaway is totally fabricated for entertainment value. The book is about an ex-military officer/slacker who gets a sales job with a pharmaceutical company because he fits their ""profile"" for the job. Most of the book involves the author describing how he partied every night and slept until noon every day while using devious, smoke & mirror tactics to convince his employer that he was actually doing his job. Obviously, the Hathaway character was added to appeal to a wider audience. I enjoyed the book and the movie and recommend reading the book for a better understanding of the real world of pharmaceutical sales."
2,"Bad acting, boring story","Heard great things about this movie. But after watching it with my girlfriend, we can't really recommend it. We expected a light weight, funny and entertaining movie. But what we got is a lot of mediocre acting, with a highly unorignial story, and we nearly fell asleep by the end of the movie. What a waste of time!"
5,A fun journey through colors.,"I'll say right off that I am a huge Grace Lin fan. I enjoy the bright colors she uses in her artwork. Her style works especially well for this book about colors. The predominant color on each page is the one being highlighted, but she uses differing shades so the pages stand out. The color being highlighted is obvious, but not too obvious. I also really like the ending that shows a wider perspective including some of the colors and places mentioned on previous pages. This book provides a delightful reading and seeing experience."
4,"good workout, bit too much equip","I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.Another great workout from this instructor. As usual, good cuing/tips without useless chit chat or annoying pep talk, great camera work, music ok, ""backup dancers"" non-annoying.Ball cardio exercises suprisingly effective considering ball is not really heavy, it is just an effort in itself to hold such an awkwardly large object. I used only free weights, ball, and step. Substituted free weight exercises during band exercises (not a fan of the band.) Step was not worth setting up and working around in limited space since it is not used very often or long. Would have been better to skip the step and do more regular floor plyometrics.Other than that, worked up a major sweat and got a decent sculpting and cardio workout."
2,Basically a home movie,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. Basically just a video shot from the front of a bike. OK - but I was disappointed with the quality. Hopefully my husband will be able to make it work for him.
3,Good but not enough,"This book intends to develop in what one already knows of the language. It point out some phrases in specific items and explain how to use in similar situations. It relates the daily life of a young couple who runs a regional restaurant. They are interviewed by a television journalist. The dialogues are pretty understables and they are recorded to a normal speed. However I think, the explanation in english must be confined to the book alone and not use so much time for that in the cassettes. I supposed that two hours of recording would have had much more listening skills but actually more of that is an english speaker trying to guide you through the french language. Nevertheless I consider this book as fairly good from which definitely you can cath many useful phrases."
5,My favorite boxed set...,Usually boxed sets have Christmas songs on them or lame celebrity guest stars. This is the only boxed set I own where I love every song on it. Figures it's out of print. You can buy it used for under $10. The deal of the century!
1,"Does not have ""Strange Fruit""",which is one of Holiday's very best recordings. In a multi-CD BOX SET they really couldn't have put that song on here somewhere? What collosal stupidity. Buy one of the many Holiday anthologies that came after this instead.
1,Pathetic,"Well, I wrote a review here before but it seems to have gotten lost. Anyway, here we go again...These guys should be in serious legal trouble for plagiarism on this album. I saw these clowns at Progfest '94, and I remember thinking - they're nothing but a King Crimson tribute band. Surprising that they didn't call themselves ""Kring Cimson""....or maybe...""Queen Ochre""!....wait, no....""Duke Scarlet""!. Hold on, wait, I've got it - ""The Reddish Royal dudes""!This CD stinks."
1,Not what I expected,"This book is filled with 30 common phrases. The first ""high-impact"" message reads ""talent alert, your ideas are outstanding""."
3,They Taste Great But Just Aren't Strong Enough For My Throat Irritations!,I get allergies that make my throat sore and itchy and I had been using the Halls mentho-lyptus throat drops and while I love how strong the mentho vaper action is I don't like the strong mediciney taste that they have and those throat drops are usually recommended if you have a sore throat because of a cold or the flu but these Fruit Breezers with pectin are for relief for everyday throat irritations and yes this stuff does taste better then the menthol throat losenges I have found them to only work if my throat was mildy itchy but when my throat is very itchy these just don't work on relieving my throat. I wish that they would come out with a losenge that would be just as strong at relieving my throat irritation like the menthol losenges but taste as good as this product.
5,A MUST for all lovers (and lovers of traditional jazz!),"As an avid fan of traditional trio-style jazz, I cannot recommend this disc highly enough. Every lick will permeate the room, setting the perfect mood for entertaining friends, reading a good book in front of the fire, or hosting a special event. While it is excellent as background music, don't let its smooth sound fool you! First there was Dad (mentor to all of those talented Marsalis children) and his years of talent both as a pianist, as well as song-writer(some tracks are original compositions) are apparent beginning with the very first lick. Confident that they will love it, I have given this disc countless times as a gift to folks of all ages and all musical tastes. It is always well received by all. Happily, it is the one of the discs I play most frequently. It is to be savored. Invest in Ellis Marsalis ""Heart of Gold"" -- You will be so pleased you did!"
4,Very nice collection of mostly standards...,"Father to you know who, this is a very nice collection of mostly standards that came out in 1992 done by the trio of Marsalis - piano, Ray Brown - bass, and Billy Higgins - drums."
2,"ok, but....","THIS IS A GOOD CD, AS ELLIS IS ALWAYS GOOD.BUT TO GET THE REAL STORY, YOU MUST CHECK OUT 12'S IT. THE MUSIC ON 12'S IT WAS RECORDED BY A TRUE BAND THAT HAD BEEN PLAYING TOGETHER FOR SIX YEARS, AND IT SHOWS."
4,Motivational Book for Writers,"I got the presentation-style overview of this book in person from the author. I took lots of notes so when I had the book in my hand, I more skimmed it than anything else. (Not because it wasn't worth reading through by any means.) The biggest thing I took away was that you have to do a little every day. Write a page. A paragraph. Write something. I took his advice. I had writer's block for 4 months. I broke through it because I thought of Mr. Stone insisting that you keep writing. So I did. And I finished my book. Also, he gives you permission in this book to have your own way of organizing your thoughts when you're writing a book. I hate index cards. With a passion. Everyone wants you to write everything on them and then lay them out all over the floor ... throw them up in the air ... take a bath with them (I don't know.) But now I know it's okay for me to hate them! I wrote a book without one index card. :) Great motivational book for writers."
3,"""Take No Prisoners"" approach","Among the few fiction writing books I've purchased, ""Novelist's Boot Camp"" is the only one that treats fiction writing like a military campaign. You do it, soldier. And author Todd Stone makes it seem like you have no choice.It's a refreshing approach, using military analogy as substitute for the usual inspirational heart-to-heart used by other how-to's. Stone also includes a 12-week program for putting together a novel. It's not very practical on the onset--unless you can buy extra time--but it admittedly gave me a confidence boost.And maybe this is the best benefit this book has. When you're tired of listening to the soft talk, ""Novelist's Boot Camp"" may give you the adrenaline rush you need. I give this just three stars, however. When the initial thrill passes, so does the novelty. Stripped of all the army-themed trappings, this book is simply passable.It serves its purpose, just like a good soldier should."
4,Nothing Much New Here,"A little disappointed. Very clever way of setting out the information, but nothing really beyond the content of many writing books out there. As an aspiring novelist who has a book case full of these, I would recommend the Fiction Writer's Brainstormer by James Smith and Write Faster, Write Better by David Fryxell. Much better and immediately useful material if you are serious about writing in a disciplined manner. But the Boot Camp title is certainly a grabber. Kudo's to the title master for this."
4,Good but not great,I found this useful but not indispensible. There are better books out there for the beginning or budding author.
4,Great for a laptop...on its own,"I got this bag for my Dell 15.4"" inspiron. It's the perfect size and all, but hardly has room for cables and extras in the main compartment. It has several other, thin compartments for papers and things. For the price, it's great, sturdy, and strongly constructed.Just wish the charger would fit with less of a squeeze..."
1,A repeat of MSDN,"This book is no tome, unless 'tome' has come to mean a regurgitation of something someone else wrote. The examples are beyond bad. Many are lifted directly from the MSDN and Borland help (translated to Pascal, of course). Delphi Developer's Guide by Pancheco and Texeria is much better."
1,A pathetic waste of print,"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this book is mostly a rehash of the Win32 help files and the stuff in Microsoft Developer Network. The examples listes are either so similar to MSDN as to be useless or too simplistic to be useful. Worse yet, the book focuses on showing things you'd never do in a real application (e.g., create a window using API calls rather than letting Delphi's VCL do it for you). And to add insult to injury, these guys do not write well. The prose is sophmoric and befuddled. Don't waste your time with this one. Get Cantu's book or Pancheco's book, they're much better."
1,Don't waste your time or your money on this book,"All the info in this book can be found in the Win32 API help files and in MSDN. Many of the examples in this book are so similiar to their counterparts in MSDN that they add no value whatsoever. The topics presented herein are covered in very little depth at all -- the book is essentially a regurgitation of the API docs. Cannot recommend this one. Get Cantu's Mastering Delphi instead. It's much better and is actually written well, unlike this book."
1,Not a good value,"I didn't think I really got my money's worth on this one. For the price paid I expected a lot more than a hackneyed translation of the graphics API. For one thing, all the examples use 8 bit graphics -- something that was passe when the book first came out and something that's certainly passe now. For another, there isn't much depth here. Many of the examples are overly simple. Last, there's too much repetition. Do we really need every graphics-related record structure repeated multiple times? I would return this one, but I've waited too long. Don't be like me -- don't waste your money on this one."
2,Looks alot like MSDN to me,"Couldn't help but notice the obvious similarities between this book and the examples in MSDN and the Platform SDK. If you have either of these, I don't know why you'd need this book. I bought it thinking I'd get expert advice and insights. All it really is is a rehash of what's publicly available from MS anyway."
4,Will you marry me Apani???,"Spinna is the most underrated producer in the game. He finds rediclious samples, some of his loops are just mind blowing. Apani is one of the best emcees (male or female) out. While her voice reminds me of a younger Roxane Shante', she is so nice on the mic. S Double has much lyrical ability. You even get a guest spot from the incomperable lord Phroah Monch. The formula here works well, beyond well even. But there's a downside to all this, the lp is bairly 35 minutes long. Indeed you'll be wishing for more. With S double in jail for a good long while, I don't think we'll be seeing a follow up, which is a shame. I can only hope Apani B releases a solo album soon, oh and she marries me!"
5,Very Nice album,I thoroughly enjoyed this inspirational album. Here are the track listings:1. God said2. In Christ3. For by grace4. The closer I get5. Got my ticket6. I'm so happy7. Words can't express8. I can do all things9. Don't follow the crowd10. In everything give thanks
3,great while it lasts,"These little guys are great while they work, but beware - they typically break their seals/gaskets before 6 months time, rendering them useless and drippy. I bought two last time I purchased them, and I have already gone through both of them. And I did make it a point to not pressurize them too much when I used them. Nice fine mist though. I think I'm going to try the MistyMate Misty 8oz. next, as it looks like it is built a little more heartily."
1,broke the minute I tried to use it. Customer service was pretty poor but did get a refund.,"I purchased this to bring down to Disney. I filled it and used it once. It worked pretty well. When I tried to refill it, something broke inside and it would no longer pump. I contacted customer service and was told to get a return number via email. I did that, but the customer service rep who communicated with me via email was extremely rude. She eventually gave me a refund on the broken product.Overall, its a very poorly made product. If it worked, it would be great."
2,Cool Blast,I only used it once and it was very nice. The problem is that it was knocked on the ground and broke. It should be made of a higher quality plastic because it does not balance well standing up.
1,Ingenious dud,"Ingenious idea as a siphon mister. Trouble is mine never worked because the top split at the seams before ever filled with water. Voila, no suction chamber, no work."
1,Not worth the money,"After ordering 3 Misty Mates 2.5 units (stupid me for ordering 3), each one had a major problem rendering it useless. The first one broke after about three uses due to the seams on the screw-on top splitting and thus not allowing pressure to maintained when pumped into the unit. (Could this have been my fault for attempting to screw on too tight? Possibly). The second one order came damaged (the top was shattered). The third on arrived with a split in the same seam on the screw-on top, rendering it useless. The unit's top is made in two pieces that are melded together with a weak seam on either side. The slightest tension or pressure causes them to split. Do not waste your money. The 3.0 unit is much stronger and sturdier."
1,Great while it lasted.,"Was great, gave nice mist, but it started leaking at the adhered base after a while and wouldn't spray thereafter. I took great care to release the pressure when not in use too. The second one, the plunger broke. I received a replacement, but it started leaking too. Too bad though, the size and portability was convenient. Manufacturer needs to conduct serious quality control measures."
5,Would order again,"This mister has worked great for me, I've still got one from a couple of years ago and it's labelled from 2004 underneath the bottle.. Fine mist is exactly what it does."
1,Very Unhappy,"I purchased this product as a gift. With expedited shipping, I paid over $30 (more for shipping than the price of the product). When the item arrived, I was embarrassed to give it as a gift. It looked like something from the dollar store - and when used, performed about as well. It just sprays a little squirt of water (not really what you could call mist). Very poor design, construction - and I would not recommend this product to anyone. It appears that it is not an actual Misty Mate, but a knock-off. Let the buyer beware - and in this case, I didn't, so shame on me. If you are considering a mister, don't order this one. Get the real deal, or another model/manufacturer."
1,NOT Fine Water Spray,"I bought 4 of these thinking they worked like O-2-Cool's product # 3133Mist-N-Sip. absolutely not the case, these small so called misterssoak you wet, no wonder kids like them, but not good for adultsthey get you too wet !!"
3,Disappointed,"Although this book was okay it wasn't anywhere in the league of many of her other books like Charlie and the Angel, Second Chance and the Rock Creek Six books. I was a little disappointed."
2,An utter callamity!,2 strikes for Lemay. This is the secnd book that wasn't worth a darn. I've given up. No more Lemay books for me. The book made my head spin. What's with all the excess material? Where's the real HTML? Something got lost. For a 4th edition you would've think she would've got it right by now.
3,"Covers the basics, but lacking","When I picked up this book, I knew nothing, and so it was helpful in teaching me the basics of html as well as design principle. However, once I had mastered the simplest stuff, I couldn't find any info in the book on how to change fonts, font sizes, backgrounds; how to make tables and frames. The book started on fire, and then just fizzled out"
2,Disappointing,"I am totally disillusioned with this book. The first 478 pages deal with fundamental HTML for the novice, while only 60 pages are devoted to advanced subjects such as Cascading Style Sheets and Dynamic HTML - the reason I ordered the book. There are no details for ""Table of Contents"" style point-and-click web pages whereby the details open on clicking the title line, and the section itself could have done with a lot more attention."
1,Never Received Order,I never received order. I emailed and never received a response and will not ever order from Amazon again
3,"Comprehensive, but overwhelming with technical information","Lemay does a good job of writing simply about a complex subject --- HTML. But if you're new to HTML code, her words may go right over your head. The few ""Simon says"" copy cat exercises do little to get your feet wet in writing code. A better choice is to use the numerous free tutorials on the Web, THEN use this book as a reference.The thick paperback is unwieldy and impractical to hold open alongside your computer. And HTML ""IN A WEEK"" has to be a tongue in cheek title!"
4,Good introduction to HTML basics,"I personally don't believe that it deserves the criticism other people are giving it on this page. Would I buy it to learn about HTML 4? No. But it is a good introduction to and a solid reference guide for HTML; a well-used copy of the previous edition sits within reach of my desk. If you don't really care about all the cutting-edge intricacies of HTML, but are more concerned with creating a usable site, I would definitely recommend this book, along with a copy of the CGI/Perl Cookbook to form a solid foundation for building your site."
2,Poorly Written but a Good Overview,"I was offended personally by this book. It is written for a college-level student but is worded as if it is for a middle school aged student. I was most offended, however, about the racist remarks implied by the author. He tends to overexaggerate and implies that caucasions are inferior and barbaric. It is a totally unbalanced book in the minority area. But, it does provide interesting case studies and overviews a wide variety of social work feilds of practice."
1,No Warranty for this product,"Do not buy this product online because there is no warranty for the product, except for those sold by an installer."
1,"Badly Written, Poorly Thought Out","If I can prevent anyone from wasting time and money on this book, I will be pleased. It is written on the level of a bad high school newspaper. Moreover, although it is a coffee table book, clearly intended for English speaking readers who are not familiar with Indian cinema, it is not organized to translate the Indian film titles into English, and it rattles off those incomprehensible names without ever describing what the film is about. IT IS NOT WRITTEN BY ISMAIL MERCHANT! He wrote the foreward; and I don't know why he did that."
3,Great flick!,"My father, Arthur Greco, appeared in a bit part of this movie and has since passed away. I had to have a copy of it to some day show my children! Of course I'm bias...I love it!!"
5,Best Vacuum I ever owned,"The Electrolux Intensity upright- excellent design, suction, and storage.I love the fact that it is so simple in design without all of the hoses and attachments.All I ever did with the hoses and attachments on my old Hoover was trip over them, Struggle with them, and curse at them when they fell all over the place.As for the small bag, larger bags just reduce suction. Also, the dirt inside larger bags just collects, then the dirt begins to stink and whenever you turn on the vac it smells.Small bag is the way to go.Excellent product, you wont be disappointed."
4,"Great suction, cord too short!","This is a great little vacuum, with wonderful cleaning capacity. My one complaint is that the cord is not long enough. It is difficult to clean a large room without stopping frequently to plug into another outlet. Major oversight!"
1,Worked great until motor went bad on the replacement vacuum,"My Electrolux Intensity vacuum worked great until the motor went bad while still under warranty. Each time I call Electrolux to check on progress of the replacement, I'm told it is back ordered and it will be 6 weeks before I will receive another vacuum. It's been 3 months and I am still waiting. I'd give the vacuum 4 stars for performance and Electrolux customer service a minus number if possible. I gave the vacuum a rating of 1 star as it hard to be happy about a vacuum that broke under warranty coupled with the problems I am having with Electrolux in getting a replacement.Update 09-19-10: I finally received the Electrolux Intensity vacuum replaced under warranty and the motor on this machine went bad too. No more warranty hassles for me, this one is going to the curb for trash pick up. I will stick with my back-up vacuum, a $50 Hoover Tempo."
2,Pushes too hard on rugs,Electrox Intensity The problem is it pushes too hard on Carpet. It is like pushing a stalled car up hill.It does well on floors/tile.
4,Impressive Vacuum Cleaner,I just received my Intersity Vacuum cleaner today and after the first use I am very impressed with its performance My carpets and rugs look so much better than when I had used my older vacuum. It is so light and easy to manuever and so far is doing an excellent job.
2,"Cleans great, but hard to use","We have had this vacuum for about 6 months. Cleans great, much better than our upright Oreck.But we have the same problems as many have mentioned - the bag is very, very small, the cord is very, very short and the vacuum is very hard to push. For these reasons, I would highly recommend you look elsewhere."
5,Super Powerful!!!!,"I loved this vacuum from the minute I pulled it out of the box (fully assembled). I plugged it in and was ASTOUNDED at the power/suction. The first time I used this machine, the bag filled up pretty quickly but as time went on, it took more and more time for the bag to fill up. (Probably because once this machine was used, it cleaned down deep and pulled up dirt that had been there for awhile that I didn't see - and believe me, I'm a fanatic about clean carpets). Because of it's smaller size and the ability to fold down, I tend to grab the vacuum more often. It's not heavy and can be carried up the stairs easily. For a machine that's not ""power"" driven, it's not hard to push/pull at all. Yes, it does grab fringe on space carpeting - but that's the same with any vacuum. It comes with no gadgets but quite honestly - I don't miss that - I used a hand held for the stairs, sides corners. It's a GREAT buy!"
5,Great vacuum,"I actually bought this vacuum a couple of years ago when I was moving and my vacuum cleaner suddenly stopped working. As a result, I paid full price for it, but I have never regretted it. It cleans far better than any other vacuum I have had. I am now moving from a one level home to a two-level home and am considering buying a second one. True, it lacks attachments, but a little handheld vacuum easily replaces them. Highly recommended."
2,Don't Go Under The Bed,"Electrolux EL5020A Intensity Upright Vacuum CleanerYeah, that's right, this vacuum may have good suction, but if you were thinking it'd fit under a bed to gather up those dustbunnies, just because the handle will flatten down to the floor, YOU WERE WRONG. The unit's main vacuumhead sits too tall to allow it passage under anything but the tallest of beds. I mean, the carry handle's nice and all, but it also raises its profile too much to be of much use universally. Got it for a good price though, woo-hoo! Dumb."
4,Good cleaner under $100,"If you are looking for a great Vaccuum under 100$, this is it. This unit cleans better than any I have used. I have used Rainbow and filter queen models and they do not compare. This folds up very nicely but it is very heavy. That is the only drawback besides the small bags that it uses. Expect to go through a lot of bags. They do supply you with several replacement bags right in the box."
2,Electrolux Intensity,"There are some good aspects and not so good aspects about this vacuum cleaner. It sucks very well. That's really the only good aspect.Now for the not so good aspects: The cord is way too short. If you live in a cracker box, then the cord is long enough. Also, after using it for a short time, the cord dosen't retract as well as it should. I have to help it along to go back in side. The pedal for lowering the handle to get under things sticks and it's hard to lower.It's hard to push on carpets. So if you have a lot of carpets to vacuum, you might want to head to the gym and bulk up.The filter bags are small and have to be replaced frequently. And guess what - they're expensive.If you're reading this review you may want to keep shopping around for another vacuum."
1,Electrolux EL5020A,"This is a small upright vacuum cleaner. I was attracted to the light weight and the folding design. Unfortunately, this vacuum is difficult to maneuver, requiring significant force to push it across a carpet. Furthermore, it leaves unattractive marks on the carpet. I would not recommend this vacuum cleaner to anyone."
2,I won't buy another one,"I bought this in July of '09, as a replacement for another that I had tried. I should have stuck with my first instinct & went to Sears, Best Buy or Target to check vacuums out hands on.What's good about it: It's powerful. It gets carpets as well as bare floors clean. It has an automatic winder for the cord. The handle folds down, so it's compact when it gets put away.What's bad about it: a 15' cord limits the range it will go without looking for another outlet, weight for an item so small, bags that are 1/5 the size of normal and aren't secured.I'll be buying another vacuum because the bag came off while it was being used & all the dirt & dog hair got into the motor & burned it out.I would not recommend this item."
3,Love/Hate relationship,"First the hate:Yes, what everyone else comments about on this vacuum really is true. The cord is too short. The profile is to high to get under beds. The bag is small. The wheels are stiff, and if you try to loosen them, they fall off.But now the love:Even with all those SERIOUS deficiencies, this vacuum really works. I have mostly hardwood floors with a few area rugs, and every time I use it (about 1x a month) I am astounded at how good the suction is and how well it picks up my kids stuff embedded in the rugs.I use a swiffer or the Shark SV800 2 in 1 cordless vac for the floors for more frequent pick up, and also have a cannister back pack for floors/corners/upholstery, but this is my go-to tool for rugs.I bought it about 6 months ago, and while vacuuming today, I thought I'd check back in and offer a review."
2,"Works well, but poor quality","This is an excellent vacuum for those with only a few rooms of carpeting, especially if those rooms are spread across more than one floor of the house. It's nice and portable and easy to carry from room to room and up and down stairs. Also works very well. Perfect for a smaller residence or a house with only a few carpeted rooms.I am very disappointed in the quality, however. The handle is already shot after only a couple of years of very light use, such that it doesn't fold down anymore. The telescoping portion also sometimes doesn't lock. The cord winder doesn't work very well either. Not the quality I expected from Electrolux especially at this price.The bags are small, as others have noted, so don't expect to be using it a lot if you don't want to pay through the nose replacing the bags."
2,"Very, very heavy to push around the carpet","This vacuum folds up nicely and is very compact - but that's probably the best thing about it! It is extremely heavy to push around - even in just a straight line! If you want to turn corners, get a wrist brace as too much vacuuming with this cleaner will leave you with sore wrists! The bag doesn't last long either - it's annoying after just two or three vacuums to have to replace the whole bag every time. Forget the stairs! It's way to bulky and heavy to lift up the stairs. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
1,"Great vacuum but I can't buy belts/bags,etc. in any of my local stores anymore.",I would be very skeptical when buying this or any other Electrolux product. I bought mine from Lowe's. I didn't realize they were going to stop selling it. They did within months of my purchase and stopped selling the belts and bags within six months. I went to other stores and I haven't had any luck. I also went to the Electrolux vacuum sales/service center. I was told Eureka owned the small vacuum business(the cheap vacuums). So now if I buy these then I must buy them off of Amazon and pay shipping every time. Who knows how long I'll be able to buy them here? Don't buy this vacuum!!!! I will never even buy a Electrolux appliance now. I don't trust them.
1,"Electrolux Intensity - good suction, bad wheels","The Electrolux Intensity is an impressive design with incredible suction power. It was perfect for what we wanted and did a phenomenal job of cleaning for one day. Then both wheels broke and fell off on day two. Doing a search on ""Intensity"" and ""broken wheels"" showed this was a common problem."
5,Great for pets,"The distance between intake and bag is only 3"", so if you have pets this is the vac for you. With other brands/models, pet hair accumulates and clogs up the long intake tube. This one has never clogged, but if it ever does I know I can use a chopstick to unclog it. Takes up very little space, and the small bag means the vacuum doesn't smell. Powerful, hasn't failed me yet and I've had one for several years."
1,waste of money,"ordered this item 7-21-10 stop working 8-21-10, great while it worked but did not last long"
4,This thing SUCKS!,Really it sucks very well. This thing sucks up stuff better than a fat lady at an all you can eat buffet! Don't put your hand or little kids near or or they will be GONE!
2,Not what I thought it would do!,"I purchasesd the Electrolux EL5020A Upright because I don't have a lot of space, and I didn't want a heavy machine. Oooops, not the easiest to use. I have 95% wood floors and one area rug. It didn't glide across the floors. First clue to send it back. It did not fit under my setee which is high off the floor. Did not fit under my sleigh bed either -- not a good thing. There is a handle to use when carrying it up steps, that is why it doesn't fit under furniture. The bags do not hold very much. So even two stars may be too high."
4,Compact and powerful,"The electrolux is probably even better looking in the flesh than on Amazon. Very powerful, folds into a small space easily. Easier on stairs the a full size vac but needs a longer cord and a suction tube to be a whole house unit. Build quality in quite good, although I hear it is assembled in Mexico. I guess that accounts for the great sale price I got."
1,Has a bad handle design or poor quality parts.,"I've had this vacuum for 18 months and the handle broke after normal use.It is not usable with a broken handle, so we put it in the shop and it is going to cost $83. to repair. Couldn't find receipt, so we have to pay for repairs ourselves. They had to order a new part, which probably won't last long either. Bad design or poor quality of parts in handle."
1,Good design - still needs work,I purchased this vacuum several months ago. When it arrived I was impressed with the compact design and ease of use. After literally 2 weeks my wife tells me there must be a error because the vacuum bag display (to notify bag is full) is lit up. After 2 weeks how could this be? So she opens up the unit and starts laughing hysterically. What is so funny you ask? She shows me the vacuum bag and it is the size of a sandwich bag. I didn't think it was as funny as she did. After a month the plug retractor button breaks so you manually have to put back. Now last week (used for only 6 months) the vacuum is not working at all. It seems the brush has melted into the metal front. The vacuum can't be fixed. Lastly the plug is extremely small so very difficult to vacuum a room over 12 x 12 ft. So skip this one at any price unless you have a VERY small place and vacuum infrequently.
4,Fantastic detail!,"Highly detailed, the gear and weapon included in this character set is amazingly detailed.Highly detailed, the gear and weapon included in this character set is amazingly detailed.intricate details and delicate components abundent: Movable legs for the FaMas, removable optics. openable grenade launcher. communication set with pvoting clip, actual wire clip on the beyonet sheath just to name a few.As a toy of this level of complexity and refinement is hardly meant to be roughly handled, this figure should be owned by children who is old enough to properly care for delicate items, or an adult collector.I highly recommend this figure.As a toy of this level of complexity and refinement is hardly meant to be roughly handled, this figure should be owned by children who is old enough to properly care for delicate items, or an adult collector.I highly recommend this figure."
5,Christmas Classic!,"I have this on tape and view it 3-4 times through the year. Now I finally have a DVD of it! The last ten minutes never fail to make me cry. It becomes more and more meaningful as the years pass as you loss loved ones and friends. The cast was great; however she is the shining light of the film. She looked so youthful throughout the film and appeared so kindly that everyone would want to encounter her in their lifetime. I think Loretta was very underrated as an actress. It is a same that she took over 20 years off from the entertainment world; but she came back in a wonderful role. If you haven't see it, make this a must see, you won't regret it."
5,Christmas Past,This movie always brings back so many great and yet sad memories of what I grew up with...it's good to see so much of what christmas may be like for some people. Even if it means someone going out of their way bringing a family together. You never know when it could be your family. I love the emotions and the love that plays throughout the movie. I never get tired of watching this movie.
5,Chistmas Eve,"Loved this movie the first time I watched it. Look for it every year. I'mputting together, old, classic, and great movies for my daughter for x-masas she loves them. So disapointed this is not available on DVD yet. It's sucha heartwarming picture. Please ........ DVD? How many of us have VCR's anymore."
4,Great Intro to Celtic Music,"Celtic Voices is one of the best compilation CD's out. The four vocalists all have world class voices and have chosen songs that showcase their talent. It is a slower CD, and doesn't contain the faster jigs and reels. But the Celtic tradition is expressed wonderfully."
5,piaa plasma ion h4,These are amazing headlight bulbs. The yellow low beam is amazing for fog and snow. No glare. I will continue to buy these bulbs for my vehicles.
3,travel pillow,I purchased this to take on trips to sleep with it ......it's not intended to use for sleeping on a bed it's way too small . Ok for a pillow to rest on when in the car or plane.
2,"At least they don't sing all at once...well, 'till the end","Aside from Neil Young's beautiful cover of John Lennon's ""Imagine"", most of this is extremely forgetable - sometimes downright phony or embarrassing - stuff. Even one of my favorite artists, Tom Petty, couldn't pull of a satisfactory rendition of ""I Won't Back Down"". And Wyclef John, taking time out of his MTV & Pepsi Commercial filming time to perform Bob Marley's ""Redemption Song"" wrapped in a flag is as close to sacreligious as music can get.On a positive note, it did benefit people who needed support in the wake of September 11th (though many funds took a long time to get through and much was even lost) - on the negative, it's filled with mostly drivel."
1,A Dead Tribute to Heroes,"Very disappointing. The performers seemed to be trying to out-mute each other, though a couple didn't seem to get the memo. I can understand that it was a somber occasion, but Springsteen's solo performance almost brought me to tears of boredom. And he was the first ""singer""! The various actors mouthing platitudes between each song would have been ok, if they could have only read the teleprompter! Since Sting was the only performer on the DVD that I normally listen to, I didn't know what to expect, but if this were how they normally sound, I would not buy any of their works! I just hope my money went to a good cause, because I will not be listening to it a second time."
2,Too many old timers spoil the broth,"Why do we feel the need to rehash old timers in times of need. We need younger singers like Britney here. Not only because she is a good dancer but a excellent singer. Because all the old timers can't sing any more. And there voices were like all shaking and stuff. And they forgot the verses and stuff. Just like Paul Simon did in Bridge over troubled Water, He forget to say , ""i will lay me down"". I can't believe he actually forgot the words and like nobody picked up on that. and they were acting like, it was like all okay and stuff. But like I said, too many old timers on this cd. And plus most of them can't sing anymore, so why the need to herd them up on this cd. I just don't get it."
5,Alicia the great,"I watched this telethon with eyes wide open, only blinking to get the tears out of my eyes. Alicia Keyes sings the notes off the page and Billy Joel gets the only round of applause simply for his obvious love for New York City. Some of these artists are past their prime, but it doesn't matter. There lyrics are timeless (Tom Petty- ""I won't back down"") and it was for a good cause. But the CD and be ready to be rocked emotionally!"
3,America,"Limp Bizkits doing ""Wish You Were Here"" was a complete joke for so many reasons. Eddie Vedder was brilliant though, I still get chills when I listen to Long Road."
4,Simply wonderful!,"On both CDs you can find very nice songs, all well interpreted. You may like or not the artists of this Telethon, but you will find the whole of the 2 CDs fantastic.All that, considering that the music isn't the first issue of this compilation.I would have paid double the price, considering that it has been done for a good cause, and, as I said, considering the music and the artists on it.So, why have I only rated this CD with 4 stars instead of 5?The only part I missed on the CD set are the spoken introductions from different artists, which would have given this CD an intensity which would merit not only the 5th star, but even a 6th one."
5,Very Nice,"an album to sit down, relax, and think about how this world is falling apart, but it gives hope at the same time.Mariah's performance was the best one in my opinion."
3,A Wonderful Mix For A Wonderful Cause,"Celebs pulling together in support of the funds needed in the aftermath of the events surrounding 09/11/01, A TRIBUTE TO HEROES aired politely and courteously on multiple networks.The eclectic mix of performers of this CD mix of hits is terrific, as many musical 'genres' are covered. Notable standouts include The Dixie Chicks (with an original composition not available anywhere else), Faith Hill (with a very gospel sounding rendition of 'There Will Come A Day,' choir and all), and Sheryl Crow (with an outstanding thought-provoking 'Safe and Sound'). While Willie Nelson boasts perhaps the most unique and recognizable male voice around, his performance of 'America the Beautiful' is a rather elementary and disappointing conclusion to the whole affair."
3,Not bad for a quick get-together,"This album helped me look forward to future tribute albums (which I'm sure will be plenty) by artists of a certain genre instead of a 'We are the world' type setting for only the big boys. Floyd's WYWH performed by Freddy & Rez was probably the best on this album. Neil Young was the perfect fit to perform Lennon's Imagine. I just hope they don't over play the special so it doesn't loose it's meaning too much. Is it me or does the album art seem to be designed by retirees who don't remember that it's 2001 by ignoring the fact that Alaska & Hawaii are now a part of our United States? Maybe they got 9/11/01 mixed up with 12/7/41? Oh well, nice compilation anyway, but I like the overdubbed songs better from BRD's Tribute collection. Sorry about your bro's Wily. But unfortunately you're right ""War is God's way of teaching Americans geography"" (Ambrose Bierce) Stay strong all!"
5,Simply Stunning,"Ever since I watched the telecast less then two weeks after the tradegy of the 11th I wondered when and if this would be put on a CD. Buy this if for no other reason then to get the chills I get listening to Dave Matthews. Every singer who performed here, whether I like or not, whether in good voice or not, makes their contribution and statement to a country and a world horrified and wounded by the acts of a few. I bought 7, one for myself and 6 for friends and family and to help the victims of that terrible day we'll all never forget."
4,Touching,"Most of this cd is good. I don't like a few of the performances but all in all very good. My fav songs are Long Road, Imagine, and Walk On."
4,e-RPG covers all the bases,"Brad's book does a very good job of explaining all of the steps required to turn your AS/400 into a Web Server. The HTML, JavaScript and HTTP sections will help you build a good foundation. The real meat of the book deals with RPG and the HTTP APIs. The Subprocedures provided by the author really make coding your own programs a snap. I've already flagged a few pages and will keep this book within reach."
5,Excellent book for all AS/400 pros!,This book is a great resource for all AS/400 professionals who need to move onto web environment with AS/400. I personally used this book to get a site running on an AS/400 with e-RPG CGI's published in this book.
3,"Good, but could be better","I have mixed reviews about this book. I had alot of good information, but still left me with many unanswered questions. The main problem with this book is that he only shows you one way to do things. There's more than one way to display a web page, but he only shows you the dynamic approach. Which is fine, if you have small web pages to load. What if you want to store your pages externally and you want to use Front Page to create your pages. There is no mention or consideration for this. He never mentions the fact that you can redirect the browser to an external page and not have to build it in the RPG pgm. Also he only shows you the Javascript approach for a shopping cart and cookies. Well, what if you want to use RPG for this instead. He doesn't even mention the fact of using the ""HTTP_COOKIE"" environment variable for cookies. Also, There was not enough elaboration regarding server configuration. It's a good starter book, but you will quickly outgrow it as I did."
1,Not what you think...,This book is not as good as these reviews make it out to be. I have read it front to back and it is mostly tips and helpful hints that most gurus already know about AS/400 Web apps. Most of reviews for this product are loaded with 5-star narratives geared to sell books....not true buyers. Beware.
5,Get up and running with eRPG,"I highly recommend this excellent book. Thank goodness for Brad Stone who can transmogrify the arcane into the understandable!This book covers everything from setting up an AS/400 as an HTTP web server to creating a complete storefront, writing all of the CGI in eRPG. Brad manages to provide a complete education about the web, including HTML and JavaScript examples. Best, of course, is that he shows that all you really need for e-commerce is our favorite HLL--RPG.If you've been waiting for a good reason to learn ILE concepts, or to learn to utilize built-in APIs, this is really the book for you. Brad will gently lead you into modular program design using ILE. He also provides source for API wrappers, and explanations for their use, which makes it a breeze to get your web site up and running.Go Brad Go!"
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS!!! THE BEST.,"I TOO STUMBLED ACROSS THIS CD RECENTLY.I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO ONE NIGHT...NOT A TOP TEN STATION..AND THEY WERE FEATURING MUSIC BY ASIA..AND I AM NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH THEIR MUSIC AT ALL.BUT I HEARD THESE SONGS...AND WAS IMMEDIATELY ENTRANCED BY THEM..AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW WHO IT WAS , BUT MADE IT MY BUSINESS TO FIND OUT.IT WAS THIS CD..I LOVE THE FIRST FOUR SONGS IN PARTICULAR..BUT THE WHOLE CD IS FANTASTIC.NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I PLAY IT OVER AND OVER..I LOVE IT ALL THE MORE.GREAT MUSIC..GREAT MELODIES..GREAT LYRICS..GREAT MUSICIANS..GREAT SINGING..IT HAS IT ALL."
3,"Call It ""Mellow Yellow""","A surprisingly mellow detour which lacks the energy and daring of Arena. Although powerful and personal lyrically, the album comes up short musically despite an all-star supporting cast and Payne's strongest vocals yet. Production and arrangements are mostly low-key, creating a mood of melancholy not previously seen. When the disc does catch fire, as on the opening ""Awake"" and the eight- minute epic ""Free,"" the results rank among the best of Payne's tenure. Special edition digipak contains three bonus tracks which ironically show that a much better album might have been, had the band stayed with their original vision."
5,Don't quit on this album!,"Listen to the complete disc about 10 or 15 times before giving it a rating. This album is excellent, but it just needs a few more extra listenings before it grows on you. The only downside of it is that the length is about 80 minutes which is the capacity limit for CD-R's. I'd have to drop a song selection from the album if I want to make a back-up disc for my car, and it's too difficult to decide which song to drop. Oh, what the hell... this album is so good that I might as well buy a second copy."
1,Very sad indeed,"Hearing this new album by Asia is one of the sadest musical moments I had this year. There are still a lot of good prog groups around, like Yes, Kansas ect, but after hearing this I must say that Asia is dead. Be warned, you will probably fall asleep after track four or so, the music is dull, uninspired, slow and boring, not one new idea to be heard. Actually, this would be a great record to play in supermarkets or elevators. I`m really sorry that one of the best prog bands has to go down like this, but anyone can expect more of a group like this."
1,Absolute Crap,"This sounds like a bowel movement. Cheesy, simplistic, unimaginative crap.I sit my beer on it. It's not even a good coaster."
1,EMBARRASSING,I clenched my teeth and somehow managed to endure the enternity of what was 79 minutes of horrible music. I can't imagine the band is proud of too much here!!!
4,Great for toddlers!,Our toddler loved the illustrations of the animals . This book can be very interactive for young children allowing them to make all the animal sounds as the book unfolds. I would definitely recommend this book.
4,cute,Fun reading for beginning readers. It's not too long and the illustrations are nice. My kids love it.
5,"Well written, not dumbed down.","I loved this little biography of John Adams. It's simple enough that my 10-year-old understood and enjoyed it, but well written and intelligent enough that my 16-year old could appreciate it. The details of his life were interesting and kept the kids' attention. I also loved the use of his own words taken from letters and diaries, I thought it really helped you to get to know who he was. Very good book. I'm looking forward to reading other books in this series."
1,world series of poker,i bought the world series of poker with eight games i loaded on to my computer but it would not play why is this can you please help me as i would love to play it the problem is when the game starts at the airport my mouse disapears so the game wont work i have windows xp i live in south africa thank you norma reid
1,World series of poker,"Watch out for what they send you. The ad says it works with mac osx, win xp and the one shipped was an old version fow win 3.1 and win 95. Then Amazon says you have to deal with the vendor and they don't want to hear about it."
2,BUYER BEWARE !!,"When I read the product details and saw that the game was XP compatible, I thought it was a new game. I also noted there are NO other sellers offering this at a discounted price.When I received the game I immeditately saw 'Windows 95' on the front, so looked at the date on back of case - 1998, ugh.Folks, I could buy this game at the local store for $5. It's an old game, old graphics, and hokey startup - airplane ride, at the airport, at the hotel check-in.Sure, all the elements of Texas Hold'em are there, but after three hands you kinda get tired of the smug dealer saying 'last card, and the same comments from other players.Don't waste your money on this one."
1,outdated and overstated,"not only is this product more than 6 years old, the graphics would look outdated on an Atari 2600.I should have read the reviews first. It says XP on the amazon site, but it really is a Windows 3.1 program and nothing more.(...)Don't buy this or any other Masque product. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have."
5,Moving Tribute,"I bought this album because I have enjoyed countless Narada releases, including some Arkenstone CDs. But I didn't expect something so moving, so uplifting and so wonderful! As a classically trained musician, I enjoy hearing ""real"" instruments along with electronic instruments. The mixture of traditional folk instruments, orchestral instruments, vocal instruments and electronic instruments has something for everyone. The album made me smile, dance and cry. I think it's an album best listened to in its entirety, since the cuts are handsomely long. What a wonderful blend of talent!"
5,Happy to Receive This,I received this CD in perfect condition and in a timely manner. This is why I do business with Amazon vendors!
2,I Wasn't That Impressed.,"I was really looking forward to this book, but, reading through the recipes, nothing jumped out at me as a ""must try this evening"" recipe. I haven't eaten at the restaurant but the recipes don't seem to have much magic to them. Maybe I'm just trying to make Tex Mex more complex than it is. One change that the book brought about though. Their recipe for guacamole is just avocado, garlic powder, and salt. I tried it and I actually like the simplicity of this recipe."
5,Great Mexican Cook Book!,Amazon provided a good price and fast shipping! I have been to this restaurant many times in S.A. The food is delicious and the book has many more dishes than I thought. I only wish they had pictures.
1,Pretty graphics- vapid instructions,"If you think that Velveeta cheese is an appropriate ingredient for MANY Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, then this is your books. If Chilaquiles made with ""crushed tortilla chips"" and Velveeta are a good idea, look no further! I've never been to this restaurant but I've never been less inspired than I was from reading this book. If you like quick, easy and apparently bland food, this might make it but if you love Mexican food you will be bored and occasionally horrified! Great graphics. It's too bad because I was really looking forward to this one."
1,Disappointing!,"I love Mexican food and wanted to try making homemade dishes so I found this cookbook at my local bookstore and thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately the first time I used it was to make enchiladas for a group of friends. I used the ""Best Tex-Mex Enchiladas"" recipe. So gross!!! I was so embarassed! I also made the Mexican rice (not impressed with that either). I'm either going to try to pass this cookbook along or throw it out because there is no way I'm touching any of the recipes in there ever again!"
2,A Waste of Money,"Robb Walsh's book is so much better! This does just seem to have been an attempt to capitalize on this family's moment in the limellight. Very dissapointing, unfortunately."
5,Awesome compilation!,"I first bought the cassette back in the 90's (in college), and was blown away, and so I recently had to buy the CD to replace that cassette (I haven't been able to find it since I moved!). This was also my first intro to the harmonies of Primeaux, Mike & Attson, and I now have a collection of their works. Great stuff, and very moving!"
2,HORRIBLE CD UPGRADE,"No offense to William Paul and the Authors of this book, but the CD is unusable unless you allow it access to the internet to review your searches!!!! (In either Windows ME or Windows XP)A complete invasion of privacy.Fundamental Immunology IV did not have that problem!(Microsoft Word is having new problems like this with their Windows XP professional as well! It did not have those problems with ME - Hum?)"
2,Too much animation,"When I bought this I was thinking that they would have colorful, real pictures of the places travelled to with animated characters to keep the kids entertained (kind of like National Geographics Geo Kids videos). I don't think my kids get the full feel of visiting places around the world through all the busy cartoon animation. Good video, but not what I was expecting."
5,They love it!,"My children (almost 4 and 5) love this video ""as much as Diego"". For them that is saying a lot. I love it because it makes geography fun, introduces the continents, and has delightful songs. Each continent is represented by a different animal. The animal takes you on a tour of something on his or her continent. Sometimes they meet (like in Istanbul) at places that are near or in two continents. The songs show the flavor of the area. Some of the places covered are more obscure (the Grand Bazaar) while others are more familiar (London). I thought there was nice variety."
2,Poor production,"Aria looks nervous in this title,just as an amateur model.If you wish to see Ariaas a professional modellook for another title."
1,get expirience on your choices,"It seems low price means low quality.this dvd contains 8 segments 1 diferent girl on each, filmed single shots, very plain direccion while girls don't know wat to do for a second. if you're looking for Aria it doesnt even shows her self as it's seen on the cover of this dvd, only if you are an insain collector of all of Arias work get this dvd at the end of your collection please and just for the pleasure of having it.I'll shall try to trik on of my friends telling him that if he likes the cover he will enjoy tons of it; and he will get that for a dollar! ja jaIf your'e triying to decide betwen to dvd's you havent seen go for the highest price..."
4,"Nice headphones, Great sound quality","I am not an audiophile, however, being somewhat hearing impaired, these headphones worked great for me. The sound is crisp and clear, not tinny. They are comfortable to wear for several hours, beyond that, I would probably have to take a break from them. They are not portable like smaller headphones, so you might not want them for travel. For home use, they are perfect. There is more than enough cord for plugging into your device too. For the money, this is a good headphone."
5,GREAT Phones! Get These they are great!,"Well, I am not a professional music producer or anything. I love music and wanted a great pair of headphones. I search for about 6 days comparing prices and quality. I must say these phones are really cheap for the quality that you get. These headphones are just what I needed and what I desired in a pair phones. You will not be disappointed if you looking for a great pair headphones. Just remember you will need the adapter parts to plug phones into your laptop or MP3 player etc. :) Cheers and enjoy!"
5,Great HeadPhones,"Very good, dont make your ears sour and they have incredible audio quality. By Them Any Time"
4,Great price for excellent headphones,"I'll start this by saying that I'm not an audiophile. I have a 2 other sets of headphones, and I like these the best. The frequency range allows for more bass and higher treble at lower volumes. The fit of the headphones is very comfortable and seem to be solidly built. I typically wear them more than 4 hours a day while working without any problems.Two things make these headphones less than perfect for me.1) The headphone jack is the larger studio size. So you need to add an adapter (which is not included) to fit the smaller headphone jack on almost any device nowadays.2) The sliding adjustment for the headphones to fit your head moves very easily. I wish it that there was a touch more friction. Every time I put the headphones down on my desk, I lose the adjustment and then have to fiddle with them for a second when I put them back on.For the price, I'm certainly willing to overlook the above 2 things. Very happy with these headphones."
4,"Pretty Good Sound, Not Very Comfortable","I listen to a lot of music and make music. These are good enough. They have a bit of bass, not too much. Wearing them for long periods of time will give headaches, they hurt my left ear sometimes too. They sound well and I know the cable won't need to be replaced any time soon with how sturdy it is. Buying the adapter required to plug it in my computer was very cheap, not more than a dollar with the free shipping when included with the headphones. I usually have to turn up the volume a lot to get it at how high I like it. Sound does leak from them a bit, and they do let sound in. Nice monitoring headphones, worth a buy if you can't afford great ones but like good sound."
1,one earred head phones,"2nd pair returned first. same problem with 2nd set, only one ear works. son said he will keep anyway. I buy a ton from amazon and never had a problem until this Christmas. Two issues so far, hope this is an anomoly. I advise to choose a different product for headphones."
3,A bit muddy sounding,The overall sound was muddy. The high frequency side didn't sound good to me (compared to my old Sony on-ear phones which I'm trying to replace). I'm going to try a higher-end pair of on-ear (as opposed to over-ear) phones instead. On the good side these were comfortable and had a nice long cord.
3,"Great sound, don't rock out in them","The sound is great, comfort, price is great. If you plan on getting mobile when you listen to music they are likely to fall off your head. That is my experience. Make the check out to cash."
1,Reviews can be deceiving,"I have absolutely no idea why this item is getting so many great reviews on Amazon. I produce music and I thought that doing some research instead of purchasing ""cool"" branded headphones would do me well in the end. After reading all of the positive reviews I thought to myself that the Amazon customers can be trusted. Well they were wrong. These headsets are set at a default low volume or at least it seems like it. I kept on looking for a volume button because they were so low. I tried plugging it into different devices and still got the same result. I tested other headsets on my phone which has Pandora and when i plugged these in complete sound drop off. Not judging the clarity because at that volume ANYTHING should sound perfectly clear. Choose another item requesting a return authorization from Amazon ASAP!"
3,good until i started mixing,"Thanks to these headphones i did the worse mix in my music production class. we all had to mix the same song and once i mixed and mastered and played it in the studio, my song was the only one we could not hear the whole way through...thats how bad it was. the song sounded completely different in the main studio speakers. i should not have to adjust that much to the bad low and mid ranges of these headphones...."
3,broken but sounded great,"these are great sounding headphones. i purchased mine in november 2007 and now finally they broke, i get no sound in one ear. wondering whether a repair is worth it. they did sound nice when they were working, i always tried to take good care so I dont understand how this happened, since they seemed pretty solid..."
5,Excellent sound for an excellent value,"These are the best headphones I've ever owned. The quality of sound is amazing. It's like hearing my music for the first time. I couldn't be happier with these headphones. The chord is really long so you can move around quite a bit while listening to your music. I also like the over-ear style because it blocks out a lot of noise so you can listen on a lower volume and not miss out on all the musical details. I looked at a lot of noise-canceling headphones, but they all seem to hiss when you turn the noise-canceling feature on, which is really annoying. The style of these headphones muffles a lot of outside noise, so you focus on the crispness of the sound. I was really blown away when I first put these on and can't say enough good about these headphones. If you plan on listening to music on a computer at work (like I do), then you'll need to get a 1/4"" to 1/8"" audio converter for the plug (a gold plated one runs about $5 at Radio Shack)."
3,Not for small heads!,"The sound quality of these headphones was the best I had ever experienced, and the noise-blocking was decent, too. Alas -- they were MUCH too large for my head... So I had to part with them. Thank you to Amazon for a quick, hassle-free return process."
3,Usable product,"The headphones are usable, but not great. The best atribute is the good sound isolation that prevents most leakage, which is great for recording studios or for on-air work. The spl (sound pressure level) capacity is good, and the comfort is good. Distortion also seems to be low.On the negative side, I did not find the frequency response to be as flat as I expected, thus making the phones inadequate for reference use. In fact, the audio quality is marginal in this regard. The deficit is even distracting for voice-over work or DJ use, which was my prime interest.Although I won't buy another due to my specific area of interest, I'll continue to use the phones in other contexts. They aren't bad overall; they just don't excel, in my opinion, due to some audio coloration."
4,Great Cans,"For the price, these are some of the finest headphones you can find.They are great for extended use. I have used them during studio recording sessions for hours on end - they remain very comfortable and sound great. The closed-back design filters out a good deal of room noise. They do not surround your ears completely, so the isolation is not complete, but they deliver a full frequency range of response. The sound is flat and true, without frequency boosts in the low end (like some other headphones), so you know that what you hear is what is being recorded.When these headphones were introduced, they were selling for $100. This is a great deal and I highly recommend them for any application."
2,Not For Big Heads,"Sound is good. After wearing them for one hour, my ears felt like they head spent a month at Guantanamo Bay. Ouch. Gents, if you wear a hat size 8 or larger, I would definitely pass on these headphones."
5,Excellent Headphones,"I bought these to replace a set of Sony MDR-XD200 headphones I've been using for a year and I've been using them for about six months now. The improvement in sound quality is amazing. I use the headphones primarily for electronic drumming. It's to the point where I won't even use the Sonys anymore. It's not just me either, my wife also noticed a big difference. You can hear things you never did with cheap headphones.The highs and midrange is awesome. Bass is average, but clean. These are amazing headphones for the price, especially the sub $60 range. I compared these to the Bose QC2's and to me, they are very close in midrange and highs, but the Bose have slighly better bass, but of course they cost $300 and the M40's are much better built, in addition they are very comfortable."
4,Worth the $$,I purchased a set of Bose headphones about a year ago and that's about how long they lasted. One day I put them on and the left speaker would not work. I paid well over $100 for them. The Technica set is great. They are much more comfortable on my head and the sound is nice considering the price tag. I am still afraid to really kick up the volume for fear of blowing a speaker. I use them every day on my treadmill. Would recommend this product.
5,worth to have,this item provides a perfect sound quality. It's one you worth to have with such a competitive price. My friend asked me to have one for him after had a experience on it.
5,myheadphones,Have been totally happy with the sound quality of these headphones along with the price. Have looked elsewhere and no one could match the price for the quality.
4,Great for home studio use,"These are good headphones for home studio or hobby recording. They are light and comfortable, and the straight cord adds little weight compared to a coiled one. Despite claims to flat frequency response, they seem a little light in the bass.I don't especially care for the swivel feature, they almost got dropped because of the sudden mass shift when picking them up."
4,Quite Good,"These are actually really comfortable headphones. The materials are super smooth, don't press in on the ears too much & are lightweight. The only problem is that they kinda slide off the head easily so you may have to fiddle a couple times for it to remain secureThese headphones come with a really nice long cable (not a curly cable). The end is a gold tipped TRS 1/4"" type connector. I'll need to get a mini jack adapter to plug it into my main system control thoughThe sound of these are really flat & well balanced. No crazy low end or ultra crisp mid stuff going on. It also provides a good amount of volume. These headphones sound quite accurate for me.A really good entry into a studio quality product at a great price"
4,"Amazing audio quality, but very uncomfortable in the long run","I've had these headphones for many, many moons. The audio quality is the reason I bought these headphones - and they deliver. The bass is great and so is every other range of frequencies; the clarity of these is better than any other headphones or earbuds I have ever tried. Yet I'm looking for new headphones now because my ears are hurting a lot from using them; about half an hour is all my ears can take with these now - the original comfort on my ears that I noticed at first has deteriorated, which is greatly disappointing; it feels as if my ears are directly touching the hardness of the speakers (no hyperbole!). This said, the padding on the top band is very comfortable and the headphones don't feel too heavy because of it.I consider these great value headphones for the thrifty audiophile, but just beware of the long-term entropy of comfort."
4,Solid Headphones,This set is for my computer. I pair it with the XONAR ESSENCE sound card. The noise isolation is very good. The bass and mid are clean. The treble is a tad too high for my liking. And the stereo image is unimpressive. I don't feel the stage presence in music. Another major complain is my ears get warm after wearing them for a while. I guess it is a common problem for closed cans design. Overall the sound is decent for the price.
4,Headphones,"I ordered these for my nephew for Christmas. After he opened them up, I was informed Audio-Technia made the top ten in Electronics from CNet. I was well pleased. I know he is enjoying them. I am planning on getting myself a pair"
2,Right Earphone cuts out,"I bought 2 of these for my studio. One came in a new box and the other looked re-packaged in in the box. I got them both out and tested them. Very good quality and full spectrum audio for the price. Both worked just fine. However, the following session I had, the right earphone on one of them began cutting out. Now I don't know if it was the re-packaged one, because I threw out the boxes and don't know how to determine which one it was or ask for replacement or return? Maybe I will just have to buy another one and use this one for parts. I've had other AT headphones and cord has broken, but was ATHM20 and cord was not replacable. I seem to have bad luck with AT products?"
2,don't,"after buying this pair of headphones, i was not happy with the sound, i heard some chatter about a pair of sony mmdr-xb500's and thought why not, they were cheaper and i needed a set of earphones that rocked,,i bought thee sony's and the adio-technica can't hold the sound,,big bucks..little bang. now i own the sony mdr-xb700's and those are as good if not better than headphones in the $800.00 range.Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones"
1,the headphone wires suckz!!!,"I just bought these headphones not too long ago, used them about 4-5 and the wires already messed up and looses sound from time to time!!! Very VERY dissappointed"
3,"Sound good, but not that comfy for my ears","I have been using only earphones, mainly SONY products for many years.Having in mind to try something more real and surrounding, I started with ATH M40fs. The price was reasonable of Amazon's. The sound seems right but the padding in ear area was not that comfortable and the frame was heavier than I thought. The most disappointing fact was that this product did not have 3.5mm stero adapter for iPOD, due to which I had to spend extra 5 dollars at Radioshack."
3,Okay,They are okay for the price. I would rather get the creative live for a few bucks more when they are on sale.
3,good for recording,These are unique headphones as in the way they rotate which works good for me while recording live onto pre-recorded music. The cons are they do like to slip off my head when I lean over and they are quite heavy. but overall for my purpose i give them a 8 out of 10
1,speakers were blown,"Opened the package, plugged the headphones into a Mac Airbook. Output seemed very quiet. After listening to a few things I realized they were blown out (very quiet, bass was distorted at any volume). I am not sure if they arrived that way or the Airbook output was too much for them."
2,Defective so don't know how good or bad,"The Headphone was defective, i.e., was only Mono even though it is spec'd as a stereo (& I believe it is that - based on others' usage) ... so returned ... am going to try others before coming back to this one."
4,Pretty good for the money,"Not great certainly, but for the price (about 65.00) a reasonable deal. At 60 ohms can't drive quite as loud as possible with a 9v battery powered altoids type headphone amp, so have ordered a beefier unit to see how that does. I'm not a huge fan of headphones and have nothing ne plus ultra to compare with but have had some killer ultra high rez soundsystems. These seem reasonably accurate and avoid the gross exaggerations of some of the more popular brands. As a result some might find them lacking in bass, or midrange emphasis, but in the long haul always better to have more accurate transducers IMHO. I don't find them to be completely comfortable either, unlike some of the reviewers, but not bad and have worn them for a couple hours at a time without undue fatigue, etc. All in all, a good value but sort of wish I had saved for some of the killer reference standard AT sets."
2,"Nice sound, nice fit, poor quality","I can't complain about the sound, but the product isn't very durable. About three years after pruchase and the flimsy faux leather covering has almost completely crumbled away, exposing the foam beneath."
3,unbalanced coz of wiring issue...,"When I first go them, they were unbalanced... the left was barely giving any sound, and the right was much louder... it turned out to be an issue with the wire inside, was stuck for some reason... yet it gets fixed sometimes, and gets back to the unbalance other times... but when they'r balanced, they sound great... clear sound, and minimal leakage..."
3,Should have bought the Sony's,"These headphones are not the greatest for patching or recording. It's just not an accurate mix. I use them with my synthesizer, but I always have to check the balance on a amp - and it's usually way off. They're fine for listening to music, but I prefer lighter weight headphones or ear buds for that."
2,One Ear,I bought these and couldn't wait to get them in the mail for mixing. As soon as I got them and tried them I realized the right ear doesn't work. I'm not alone on this. nearly EVERY one starred reviewer had the same problem and Audio Technica charges you to have them fixed. It's their product that failed fo no reason. Why should we have to pay more for their crap? Don't buy these. Either save up a bit more and buy the m50 of spend less and get the m30.
1,Right headphone does not work,"I bought these mainly for mixing my music, and to have a good pair of headphones. The music sounds great on the one ear phone that actually works. When they arrived i pluged them in and the right ear phone already did not work! Once in a while the right ear phone will scratch back on and it will work, but i dont think i have to be able to tap the side of the headphone to make it work, especially sence i just spent my money to buy these.Otherwise the cord is nice and long to plug into your stuff and you will have plenty of room.The ear phones do get uncomfortable real quick."
2,actually took the time to write this,"when i first got these on new years they were awesome. i was really careful with these. but after i accidentally dropped them once, they started to crackle on the bass. it's still usable though."
3,"sorry , not good enough","sorry. thought they knew what a monitor headphone was.audio technica, only gives u good monitor typesIF you give them over usd 200 net.sad. its got decent character,perhaps, somewhere in middleof the huge usd 50 -120 dollars group....butNOT a monitor type, not accurate enough...too much unrealistic bass, and too muffled.if you actualy use this to monitor recordingsyou will be re doing it all over again...dont bother with it please.i would request people not to say :the best i have ever used.think about it.( how the heck do we know how many hundredsyou hve listened to ? ) we dont have your referencepoint.too bad. tho...thought this would be a decent one to work with.tksk"
2,Audio Technica ATHM40FS Precision StudioPhones,The item works fine but it was not new. It was refurbished at best. Box had been opened and seemed old. It works... but I was expecting a new item. Could be happier.
2,Audio-Technica Headset,The photo of this headset did not show a wire. I thought it was wireless.I should have read the description more thoroughly and done some additional research. I returned them and purchased a wireless set with no problem.
2,Bulky. Not very loud,They are really bulky. You'll need to buy an adaptor. Don't get as loud as I want them with my ipod
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for something affordable with good sound quality. I was sure i found it, but since i started the first track which was pretty heavy on bass I became very disappointed. Even koss ear buds are performing much better, both in terms of bass and in terms of clear sound. I felt like listening to stock honda civic speakers(those are horrible). Will have to return it. Maybe those are good for recording like some other people say, but I definitely can't find anything good about those. Changing for something better."
2,Poor sound quality to what was advertised,"I bought these headphones expecting them to be great sounding. However, they were not. I returned them after listening to them for one day. Bass sounded as if it were being drowned out and overall grainy sound. I listened to FLAC files to be sure. My cheap Sony earplugs have better quality than these. I would not recommend these to anyway."
3,Adequate,"The earpieces do not flip like I'm used to, Instead, they turn on a vertical axis. It's totally weird. The sound is good however."
1,Auto-Mute not very helpful,"I ordered these for use with my new smartphone so I could listen to the mp3's while I went aout my farm chores - lots of tractor work, etc.I landed on these after reading reviews of several headphones, and this one kept climbing to the top. So, I shelled out the dough, and here they came. I did have to buy an adapter to get them to work with the phone, but that's all.They do let you listen to your music, but only if you're in a very quiet room. I have a cheap set of old Sony's that aren't very comfortable to wear (the reason I chose these), and the difference in volume - which I need - is unreal. The Sony's, I actually have to turn DOWN the volume on the phone. The Technia's are awful in this regard, in that they hold the volume to a minimum level to begin with, and you can't change it.Do not buy these if you want to listen to music or anythjing else, unless you live in a soundless bubble. A huge waste of money."
4,Pretty Good,"I don't have much to compare them to as I haven't bought much besides these as far as headphones go. But it's pretty decent. Sometimes I don't like the sound separation between music and voice (speaking, singing/instruments). I was rapping for about a year and I mostly used these for my home studio. Honestly it wasn't SUPER great, but it was ok for $50. I still use them for regular listening and they aren't bad. Probably a lot better stuff out there for more money though."
4,I think it mae be good,"I have a lot of research about the closed-headphone, but last I choose this one, when I got and used it,I think it good, its-closed is good, and the details of music is good, the bass might not arrive this potential.and the headphone quality is wondeful!"
2,Wonderful Music Headphones (if they work),"Like many reviewers have said, these are really nice smooth, balanced sounding headphones. They don't exaggerate the highs and lows, so the music is very pleasant and very clear. I love the way they revel deep bass without distortion. They have light pressure over the ears and are very comfortable for extended periods of listening. I highly recommend these for an excellent value in decent headphones.The ""Cables To Go - 40636"", is an excellent matching adapter for 3.5mm use.UPDATE:My first pair I bought a year ago, are working and sound great - five stars.But I bought two more for a friend. On the first pair, the left channel arrived dead. On the replacement pair, the right channel arrived dead. They were tried on two different sources. I'm beginning to think there might be a manufacturing problem. Just be careful buying at this time (early 2012) until they fix the dead channel problems."
3,Did not meet expectation,This headphone is just OK. I read all the great reviews and was pretty dissapointed.I am using it for studio recording and classical music. The high frequencies are kind of dampened and the headphone sounds like boxy. I returned the headphone and purchased the ATH-M50. What a difference!! It is worth to spend the extra bucks and enjoy the balanced tone quality.
1,Great sound for one week,"I recently purchased this pair of headphones based upon its excellent reviews. I was looking for a pair of headphones to use for critical listening, and I was pleased with the results for the first several days until the right earphone stopped producing sound. I was hoping that these earphones would last much longer than a week."
5,GREAT HEADPHONES,"I was planning on buying on another set of headphones, but someone on headfi.org suggested the ATH-M40fs, so I gave it a try. I am so happy that I took the risk in buying this set. Unlike the popular fashionable headphones, I can hear every note and instrument playing clearly. These headphones expose the the subtle sounds like the basses playing in some classical pieces. The bass is just perfect, enough that it does not hurt my ears when I listen to some music with heavy bass.On the flip side, the headphone is somewhat heavy, but it is comfortable."
5,Excellent headphones,"This review is from: Audio-Technica ATHM40FS Precision Studio Headphones (Electronics)These are some of the best headphones I've owned. The sound is clean and realistic with no extra bass or treble.For people that love lots of bass these might not be the best headphones, although if you add bass on your receiver they produce great bass! Remember the sound is very honest and real!For that price I doubt you can buy something with more quality than these.These headphones are also fantastic for mixing, the sound is very clear and accurate.It's a pleausure to listen on these headphones, I can hear so many details!Highly Recommended!"
5,Sound very nice and are comfortable,"This model offers very good overall sound, good bass and balanced ,are super comfortable, are well constructed.....For 50.00 Dlls definitely recommend them and give 5 stars."
2,One ear went out within the first week =(,"I wish I could give these 5 stars, because when they worked, they were comfortable and the sound was great. However within a week of having them, one of the ears started fuzzing out and eventually died altogether.Let me be clear that I was not hard on these in the least. They were the most expensive headphones I ever had at that point, so I was extremely gentle with them. They went from my head to my desk, no drops, no pulling on the cord, nothing. From looking at the other reviews, it seems that these phones may have design issues, as there were multiple other reviews with the same problem.The good news is, Amazon was extremely helpful and gave me a full refund, no questions asked. Now I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280s, and they have given me no problems so far."
4,Good device,"These headphones are really good! The specifications are really deceiving unless you know what you are looking for, all and all they are awesome though. Sound quality is excellent, they are noise reducing so you don't need to turn up the volume so high to hear them. I only encountered a couple of problems. 1. I didn't notice that they had a bigger jack so they aren't for standard audio devices and 2. They kinda press on your ear so it is uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time."
5,Great small saw,"I have had this saw for 3 years and have framed a portable building and many other small jobs and its great. If you want a saw which will handle trim, 2x4s, and other small widths this saw is great."
4,Oliver Grunner's best!!,"Made in 1990, this was the era when low budget Martial Arts movies were excellently produced. Oliver Grunner plays Jaques Fontaine a French student who comes to the US as an exchange student. He boards in a household with an innocent family who continue to be harrassed by a gang of hoodlums. Grunner shows of his Kickboxing style in this martial arts extravaganza. Good Plot with dynamic fight sequences..one of director Eric Karson's best movies."
5,Very Inspiring Book,"One of best, most definitive books about Outward Bound. Zelinski's stunning photographs transport readers directly into the soul of the Outward Bound experience - the compassion, courage and self-discovery that have inspired the millions of individuals who have experienced Outward Bound first-hand. Not just a book about outdoor adventure, but a book about personal transformation and self-discovery."
5,"A high-energy, fun neo-swing album","I've had this album since last summer, and it is one of the most fun albums I've heard. BBVD is a great band for parties, evidenced by their time as the house band at L.A.'s Derby. Their songs are mostly upbeat and fun, and also mostly original compositions. However, the boys give a shout out to the past with a neat remake of ""Minnie the Moocher."" BBVD is probably the least jazzy of the neo-swingers, but they make up for it in fast, rocking swing tunes that are definite crowd pleasers."
4,"First release, raw sound","I beleive they were only 4 member strong at this point, and fresh out of punk music, and it shows. Hard edge music, but still some great tunes that have yet to be rerecorded by them. They sound alot bigger than 4 members. Deffinet should buy for anyone who likes them and all kinds of music. Interesting to hear the diffreneces between them on this and them doing the same songs almost 10 years later."
5,the dry Martini...,"I always felt Old Friends would lend itself beautifully to a jazz interpretation, and here it is. Paul Desomond is such a unique stylist; so subtle, pleasant, beautiful yet masterful... an alternative to the great players who come at you 100 mph... this is a beautiful album..."
5,I Heart Birthday,"This is by far my favorite song from their full length, 'Last Exit'. The dreamy overtone and sugary melody is just infectious, sending you either into a trance or to the dance floor, depending on your mood. The other songs are good too, though you'd probably be better served just getting the LP since I believe all of the tracks found here are on that disk also. Excellent stuff."
5,Excellent for beginner and veteran,"I have woked in visual efeects for over 10 years and I like to think I know a great deal about my field but I still found that this book provded me with additional information on subjects I was already aquainted with. If you are new to visual effetcs the book provides a good overview of the many crafts associated with VFX and it is also a great refresher for those with experience. Mr Woodys book covers a wide spectrum of concpets and disciplines used in visual effects work in an enjoyable, easy to read style. If you're looking to get into VFX this is a great place to start."
4,Good book for someone starting out...,"This book has a lot of good information. It focuses more on practical effects and model building rather than digital effects, which is cool. However, if you are already in the business of creating visual effects, you probably will not get a lot out of it. With that said, the book is good and I DO recommend it for people getting started."
1,arrived DAMAGED WITH BOX,"The product arrived DAMAGED WITH BOX, NOT APPEAR ORIGINAL, the perfume does not last a long time and quickly loses FRAGRANCE"
5,classic product,I got this as a gift for my nephew. He loved it totally. Branded product for not so branded price.
1,Scam!!!!!,"CK one 3.4 oz, I received a perfume that was previously opened. The plastic wrap around the box was missing. It doesn't say that in the description. I feel cheated. Do not buy this if it is for a gift."
5,"Spellbinding, moving and magical","Karen Matheson and Connie Dover's voices are magnificent. If you enjoy Celtic music, this CD is a must. Love songs are even more enchanting when you can't understand the words (some songs are in English, though)! The music really draws you in. I find myself playing it over and over. Came upon it at a 1/2 price book store by accident, what a find!Narada has done it again!"
4,Beautiful Music,This is a terrific CD full of warm and romantic music. It's perfect to listen to or to have as background music.
3,If you want loud this is loud ...,This is one great CD to throw into the car and play while driving down the road with windows open. All you have to do is to move the volume up a little over the wind noise and you will hear everything. The lowest whispered voice to the highest note will all be hear at the same volume. The quietest musical note to the loudest bagpipe type sound is all the same with the way this CD has been mixed. The musicians are great with great vocals. Just don't turn it up to much or you ear drums will rattle even from those whispered voices.
1,Defective,CD is defective. Extreme static on all tracks on four different playback devices. Granted it is used but I have NEVER encountered this problem on a commercially created CD before.
3,A great story starred by Dennis Hopper,"These DVD features one the best episodes in the series and one of my personal favorites: ""He's alive"". It stars a 27 year old Dennis Hopper in a very interesting role: a young fascist emulating Hitler. Hopper's performance really shows things to come in his career, and the story written by creator Rod Serling is -tragically so- scary, and most of all a sad reality still among us... Two more episodes are included."
2,The Twilight Zone Vol. 27,"I purchased this to show to a group of friends. The first part was too long, so we saw the second part and it was fine. Tried to show the 3rd part and it was garbled as to sound and picture. It was unusable"
5,great case,"I got this for my 13 year old son who's been playing trumpet for 4 years. It's a well made case. He loves it because it's more ""hip"" looking than the old hard shell case. Very roomy."
4,Great bag!,"We recently purchased this bag for our son who is in band and wanted to ride his bike to school. This has increased his safety as opposed to trying to juggle a hard case with simple hand-grip to now being able to use both hands on the bike for better control. It is comfortable, compact and yet has plenty of storage space for all he needs. Wish it had a secure slot for mouthpiece in the padded foam lining, but other than that, awesome buy."
5,I wish I had this case sooner...,I got this case last summer so I could bike with it from my house to band rehersal. I wish I had this case in high school. It would have saved me the troubles of a soaked trumpet case as this one is super water resilient.It is great for those who bike around with their trumpet or kids who take the bus. I biked through the pouring rain and snow with this case and not a single drop of water got on anything inside it.
3,Not recommended for young players,"I bought this for my 11-year-old son last year. Although it's a beautiful case -- and it would probably be fine for an adult player -- it was NOT protective enough for my son. He took it on the school bus to school, and just the pressure of his leaning on the case was enough to ruin his trumpet beyond repair. I would highly recommend that all parents who have any concerns about the ability of their kids to be gentle with this case to buy a hard case instead."
1,horrible padding,i ordered this case as a replacement for my big plastic one and the day after i started using it my trumpet was bent from the brace forward so the bottom line is THIS CASE SUCKS!!!!!!!! IT IS HORRIBLY PADDED
5,Good,"My batteries were from Asia (with Asian writing). Not sure if that matters to anyone, as the batteries were just plain/good/etc."
4,Great Brand But...,I love the brand but the batteries are not that strong. I placed some of them in my TV remote control and they were still going kind of slow.
3,only,"Natalia Laperierre saves this video from being a total flop...and all she shows is a little ""slip"". If you like the other girls in this vid you can spend your money elsewhere by buying their xxx rated vids instead. Why pay good money to watch hard core adult films stars act like first time models??"
5,A MUST for any family library!,"This is a beatiful book carefully put together about a cherished topic...values within a famliy. It is a handbook for raising good kids. Our family atmosphere has changed since using such techniques as CAF (consider all factors), calling my children ""My bright one"", and standing firmly on the foundation of loving DISCIPLINE. You'd be crazy not to get this book!"
3,A Small Glimpse into a Fascinating Life,"I got this because I was interested in the man behind the ""revolutionary"" design of the telescope.What John Dobson revolutionized was large aperture reflectors (thin, plate glass mirrors) on economical, sturdy mounts (plywood and teflon) that anyone could use that would enable one to see the Universe as it really is.As a telescope making manual, it's fair - bare bones and not much theory. As an introduction to Dobson, it's tantalizingly brief. More info by and about Dobson is probably available on the web.The binding is unique, and problematic. The front and back covers are plywood sheets (one of Dobson's prime construction materials) with a glue binding. My copy has several sheets that have become unhinged.Recommended as a Collector's Item."
3,The tale of a mystic engineer.,"John Dobson is a character. His book shows how and why he developed a modification to an altitude/azimuth mount for telescopes.John combines his new mount design, he calls it a sidewalk mount, which is a brilliant adaptation of a long existing design, with abandoned technology, the thin plate glass mirror made from poorly annealed portholes from retired ships, to arrive at a rough design that, while good for limited purposes, is largely useless for true scientific work. The design has been improved over the years by countless amateur telescope makers.In this book, John also recounts his life as a monk, and how he came to leave his monastery in San Francisco and go into the world, where he shares his unique cosmology with those who will listen."
3,There was something there y'all missed!,"Around the time this cd was released, there were literally tons of debut cd's showing up at the record store every Tuesday. This kind of snuck in the door with the rest of the chaff, and was basically thrown out with them.What we have here is a debut that should have launched a star. There are 10 classic country sounding songs that died before they ever were given a chance to live.The lead off track, the title song, should have been a big single, along with the one track that made it to radio, ""Rosalee.""Cambell had a heart for traditional music. He made original classic country music in the days of Garth. Unlike artists like Dale Watson, who make traditionaly SOUNDING music, this was the real deal.One day he may catch on. Get this cd for the discount price above and find out the secret that a few people already know: That Stacy Dean Campbell was the next big star that never happened."
5,great !,"The messages in the songs are all different but all great ! It is very well rounded out ! Great country music, the way country music should be!"
2,Not what I expected,"Lean on me, and Ain't no sunshine are wonderful. The rest of the selections are not what I care for. Withers has talent, sensitivity, and a beautiful voice but he does music which is not something that I enjoy. Simply stating my own preference."
5,Fantastic!!,"This is a fabulous album -- Patton's best so far. Beautiful lyrics, great use of acoustic guitar and myriad other instruments, great vocal range, just great stuff. It feels like everything else Patton has been in anticipation of, and leading up to, this point. His diverse range of musical interests and abilities are on on display here, and all working together. Really a great album; I highly recommend it!!"
2,For absolute beginners only...,"Yes, the title of this dvd states for beginners, but it's beginner with no background in oly lifts beginner. I would almost say it's beginner with limited lifting in general (squats, deadlifts) experience. For the $ would recommend Greg Everett's book or the older WCC dvd's. There are some tips in there and a nice reminder of the basics.Fortunately, in a way - the DVD I received was defective and was able to return it. It skipped and froze but from what I did see, not worth the money.No disrespect to Dan John though, he's one of the most respected coaches in the industry."
4,old type DIY tool sanding belts,"hard to find these sized belts anymore. OSH used to carry them but alas, no longer. So I ordered a few extras rather than buy a larger belt sander (current standard size). They are as durable as the ones I previously used, so no decrease in quality for an older product. Nice!"
4,Sublte & Evocative,A very low-key South American procedural. It will get under your skin like the sinister premonition that sets the story in motion. The enigmatic finish will nag at you for days.
5,Another winner,I read this when it first came out in Portuguese. The English translation is excellent and loses nothing at all. A delightful story.
3,"Mediocre music, with a few gems.","I am a fan of Arkenstone, Lanz, and Kostia, so I was really expecting a lot when I bought this. Most of it is bland or annoying. Only one piece was by Lanz, and it sounded like a reworked version of Dark Horse. I expected Kostia to be the most classically influenced, and he is, in Close Without Touching, but his Walk With the Stars wasn't all that great. Celebration, a triumphant march, is worth the price of all the rest combined. Another really good one is Savannah Runner. Forge to the Field is tuneless and synthesizer-heavy, and Arkenstone's other three tracks are so unmemorable I can't even remember their tunes. Not an essential"
5,Comfortable and Great Looking,These shoes fit like a glove. They are very comfortable and true to size. The inside is soft suede-type leather with padding in just the right places. I thought there was going to be a break-in period but these shoes were comfortable to walk in from day one. A very sturdy and comfy shoe at a great price.
3,A bit uncomfortable if you have bunions,"Nice shoe, good quality leather. The band around the foot doesn't allow alot of expansion so it hurts the bunions. If it weren't for bunions, these are perfect, comfortable shoes."
4,somewhat masculine,"I am just a tad disappointed at the style -- just a tad masculine for me. Otherwise, they are comfortable."
2,Cute but uncomfortable,"I bought these to wear to work for daily use and was very excited to get them on sale. They were very stiff when I initially took them out of the box to try them on. They have not loosened up at all in the three months I have had them. The push on the tendon above my heel and squeeze at the buckle. I wore band-aids to help with the blisters they caused, but it got to the point that I hated putting on my shoes to go out the door in the morning. I should have sent them back at the beginning when I felt how unyielding they were, but naively I thought they would adapt to being worn. Now, they sit in my closet, gathering dust."
3,Just ok,"I am a Clark fan! This loafer however left me wanting more, didn't feel like the regular clark support and comfort I am used to. I thought of returning it, but I wear it ocassionally with one specific pair of slacks."
1,Unhappy Coach,This is a total lie. They charged me 40.00 for shipping after I thought I ordered 10dozen baseballs. I received the order and low and behold there was only 10 baseballs. The weight of the item was 6lbs. I will never order anything from fogdog ever again.
4,Pole dancing for u,I think the dvd was a good start for someone who is just starting the pole. It teaches the beginner moves with few intermediate moves. It use a student for some moves and the more advance ones the instructor does. But if u are looking for more advance pole dancing then this is not the dvd for u.
3,It's ok,The DVD is very informational. I do recommend this DVD to somebody how is interested in seeing how the process works.
1,kindle review,A book larger than 30 pages and priced at more than 20 cents ought to have a table of contents. Shocking!
1,"Make Love, Not War","While reading this book, I feel like I'm experiencing a flashback to the 60,s -wearing flowers in my hair, planning to move to a commune, while searching for that one great secret, the hidden thing - the meaning of life itself. This book reads like a sales manual for Buddhism.This will be required reading for my son who is going into the 10th grade this fall. It's amazing what passes for a ""classic"" now. I could think of so many other useful ""classic books"" that he could read which could do much to stimulate critical thinking and maybe even coerce some realistic self-reflection or character building attributes. I can already tell that this will be tortuous reading for him and not at all within his range of interests. A waste of some perfectly good trees."
1,useless,This book is nonsense. Don't buy. I have a hard bound version of the book and it's being used as a paper weight.
1,It sucked the big one!,This book was horrible. The writing was decent but the topic was one of the worst that I have ever seen. I dont see how this book was published.
3,"great story, some poor grammar",Great story. The words and concepts make you think and reflect upon your own life subconsciencously.There were a lot of incorrect words and bad grammar.
4,better than i thought,I purchased this book to read for my book club. I did not think I would enjoy it as much as I did. Worth a read.
1,Terrible translation,"I compared this copy of Siddhartha to a copy of my own, purchased from a used bookstore. I was so disappointed in the translation of the one I purchased from Amazon. I had planned to give this new copy as a gift, but ended up giving my own. If you're going to read Siddhartha, the beautiful prose is what makes this novel so rewarding; this copy is so simplistic it's painful to read."
1,Not my favorite.,"Eugh. So many grammatical and spelling errors. Better translations are available for free online. Also, shoddy construction. The plastic coating on the outside was peeling before I even opened the box."
1,Right book wrong translation,SiddharthaI highly recommend this book but not this translation. The awkward sentence structures and many typographic errors get in the way of the reading. This is a story which should flow and unfold not stutter and stammer.
1,Don't judge this book by its cover!,"Several years ago when I first read Siddhartha I did so as part of a search for understanding the elements of Eastern spirituality. The book was mentioned in a surprising collection of other authors during that zeitgeist which is how I lost my original copy: borrowed and not returned! The recent replacement copy of Siddhartha sent to me through Amazon,however seemed to be an unedited and oddly formatted (margins inconsistent)piece of literature. There were grammar errors and odd translations that distracted from the text. A German word had been put in English form with parentheses and a question mark, for example. There was no publication date that could trace the authorship. Was this a bootleg?"
1,"""Free"" Book... Awful Translation","This is truly a great book, but the translation of the free version is awkward and painful. I suspect that the volunteer(s) knew German very well, but their English was like that of a foreign exchange student on his first day in America. I read it all the way through, but would gladly pay a few bucks for a professional translation if I were to do it again."
2,Too Modern Translation,"This translation attempts to modernize the phrasing of the book. Lots of contractions and the use of words like ""gaga"" as in he went gaga. All that is accomplished is that the power of the words has been dissipated. The story is there, and that's wonderful, but the power of the language has been drained away. Try another translation -- you will be glad you did!"
3,IT's OK,This book is okay. It is not the author's best work. Easy to read... This kindle edition has some spelling mistakes.
4,review for Siddhartha,"Herman Hesse's book, Siddhartha, is a very good read. Entertaining yet spiritual, it's perfect when you like to ponder life and its meaning; I recommend it."
5,Perfect,Siddhartha changed me completely. The way of showing things gave me another perspective on materialism. It helped me a lot in a time in my life where ups and downs where the main event in my emotions. I recommend this book because not only shows the meaning of love but because its simplifies what other religions tend to elaborate and distort.
5,Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse,Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse'Siddhartha' is an allegorical novel about the spiritual transformation of an Indian man called Siddhartha in the 6th century BC.
2,overrated puerile philosophy,"First of all, as a classic this book should be held to a higher standard. There really is not anything in the book that is not predictable. As story, the book is rather dull. Furthermore, the language used in translation is really rather baneful. Having said that, I still kind of liked the general theme of the book."
3,"Great Story, Several Transcription Errors","Hesse's Siddhartha is simply a great book. Read in one's youth, it is a compelling call to spiritual quest. Read again prior to one's senescence, it is a reminder that the pilgrim winds up where she/he has always been: precisely here.I enjoy reading books in Kindle format...most often on my iPod Touch because I prefer the easy pocket-ability of the Apple form factor (hey Jeff, how about an iPod Touch-sized Kindle with an electronic paper screen for $149?). What I DON'T currently enjoy about the Kindle format are the apparent transcription errors I occasionally encounter in texts: missing letters, missing words, and even a missing phrase. Other Kindle readers I know have mentioned this phenomenon.For whatever reason, the Siddhartha file I downloaded had an unusually high error rate...enough to interrupt the flow of my reading at several points. While not a ""show stopper"", this diminished my reading experience."
2,No proofreading done?,"This edition of Siddhartha might be a publisher's galley proof rather than a final copy---it is riddled with typos, which is highly distracting to a careful reader. You might want to try an edition with a more well-known publisher instead."
