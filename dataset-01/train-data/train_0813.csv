3,It's ok.,"Nancy's accident was tragic. The best music from the band was the pre-Woodstock recordings. There is enough good stuff on this album, though, to make it worth several listens."
2,Davidoff Cool Water Ice Gel,"Disappointed in this product. A very Small amt. in a flexible hard to extract and control amount tube. I love Davidoff Cool Water Fragrance,but this proved a mistake to purchase this form of the product."
3,Not the whole truth,"The book spends a lot to space covering his childhood and youth as a Cuban counter-revolutionary, when the ""hero of a hundred battles"" saw no action. It has reasonably good coverage of Che Guevara's capture and execution. The book becomes increasingly selective as the author becomes dirty. It is sketchy on his meetings with GHW Bush and Oliver North, his activities in Nicaragua, and CIA inner workings. Beginning life with well intentioned idealism is not a novel story. I wanted to read about Iran-Contra."
1,15-yrs old and mad,"I bought this figure becuz I'm a Jango, Boba, and all other bounty hunters enthusiast. However, upon opening this product, words can't express my disappointment with this shameful excuse for a Jango Fett toy. I found the ""Jango's Final Battle"" jetpack interesting. But after examining it in the movie, I'm pretty disgusted. Since when did Jango have Slave I's engine pod on his back? It's absolutely huge and unwieldy by even the strongest of hunters! And the role of this huge clunky hunk of plastic? To play horribly regurgitated ideas of what sounds Fett made in the movie. And sort of like Kamino and Final Battle Jango, this thing is removable, but makes Jango hollow at the torso. A note to Jango fans who might buy this: Leave it in the box."
4,Awsome,"I just bought this toy today and it's awsome.Some Pro's are it comes with 2 blasters,armor,jetpack that makes noise,and rifle.Some con's are it can't move his legs or wrists.Over all it's awsome."
3,NOT THE BEST ONE,"THE TOY ITSELF ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT,HAS SOME GOOD FEATURES AND THE BAD ONES.JET PACK IS TO BIG! JANGO LEGS CAN'T BE MOVED.THE EXTRA GUN [is not good],THERE IS THREE NOISES THAT COME FROM THE JET PACK.TWO GUN BLAST AND ONE OF HIS JET PACK.THE JANGO FETT FINALE BATTLE IS THE BEST AND THE PREVIEW FIGURE AND THE Kamino Escape ACTION FIGURES ARE ALSO VERY GOOD THIS ONE IS NOT ALL THAT GREAT,"
3,This figure is not that great,"If you are only looking to collect Star Wars figures I would recomend buying this product. However don't be surprised if the figure is not what you expected when you open the package. Personally i think 20$ Canadian is too much for an extra 3 noises. Which are PSHHH BANG and ROAR. The figure itself is not to special. It only has 5 points of articulation and the chest plate blocks the arms, allowing them only to move up half way. The figure does look ok but the jet pack is very bulky. If you really wanted this figure i am sorry i ruined it for you. If you really want a Jango Fett figure to add to your collection I would recomend getting Jango Fett Final Battle instead."
1,This book is Fiction!,"Read this book if you are looking to read a work of fiction. On that level, the book is amusing. Don't read it if you are looking for a definitive book on the Kennedy assasination. The bibliography starts out by saying that the book ""contains incomplete information about its sources"". That gives you some idea about the substance of this book. This book is about a ""Rumor"". The ""Rumor"" makes for good fiction, not fact."
5,horses(stampede art poster print,I loved the quality of this posterfor for the price i couldnt have gotten a better poster it looked better than i could possible hope for
2,"Poor quality, slow shipping","The print quality is so bad. you can see the pix on the poster. Shipping took for ever. I didn't like it much after I got it. however, you get what you paid for. I paid less than $10."
5,Love it,"We love this CD and know our great niece will, too. The prompt delivery and great condition will ensure a wonderful Christmas."
3,Goofy Moose,This guy writes clever entertaining lyrics- I got the CD because of the moose in the road song (I've had the experience) but it turns out that is the only song without the gawdawful goofy moose voice- I should have listened to more samples. I'm no kid so maybe my opinion doesn't mean anything but the goofy moose voice ruins the CD for me and my wife. Kids may like it- I don't know any kids to ask. Other than that I give it a big thumbs up- intelligent lyrics and good production.
2,Should have stuck with Cow Tunes for Kids,"I feel like I wasted my money on Moose Tunes for Kids. My family loves Cow Tunes for Kids, so I thought I'd try another Brent Holmes CD. I made the wrong choice with Moose Tunes. The songs are sung by ""Brent Homes & Marty the Moose."" The moose voice is very annoying. My son (just turned 4) told me that he likes the songs, but he doesn't like the moose (voice). You wouldn't believe how just one line sung in that moose voice can ruin a song. Also, the songs aren't as peppy as the ones on Cow Tunes. From the first time we heard Cow Tunes for Kids, my sons (then ages 1 and 3) danced around the room to the happy, catchy tunes. I just got the Moose CD, and I'm sorry to say I'm disappointed. With Moose Tunes, my 18-month-old hasn't smiled at the tunes yet and my 4-year-old has already asked on more than one track, ""Mommy, when will this song be over?"""
3,Great travel music for Kids!,"I found this CD when I was in a gift shop in Montana. Not sure how you would get ahold of a copy now, but it is worth it. The voice of Marty the Moose is very deep and goofy. My 20-month old son bounces and dances to these songs while he rides in the carseat. Every kid should hear these hits!I want to buy these CDs for my neices and nephews. Brent Holmes also does ""Cow Tunes for Kids"" and a few others that I'm sure are great too."
5,Simply Wonderful,"With ""Does he love you"", ""It's your call"", and ""Take it back"" Reba shows pure beauty in not only her music, but also her videos."
5,Still a masterpiece,"I will keep this review short and sweet. The game is an absolute masterpiece. The fact that this was only the second attempt by Bioware to make a game (Shattered Steel was their first) is astounding. There isn't a single weak point to be found in the game. Everything, from the music, characters, storyline, to the well-paced action and RPG elements, have made this game a classic.The reason I am reviewing this game now is because I picked it up again for old times sake. The game is as good as it originally was, if not better, because I am picking up on a bunch of details I missed the first time. The artistic graphics for this game still look fantastic, which is simply amazing when you consider how fast the graphics age for computer games.In conclusion, Baldur's Gate is my second favorite RPG game of all time. Only the sequel is superior, as it should be (It's like comparing the first 2 Godfather films). If you have not played this game, you are not a fan of RPG games."
5,Generic BG1 review,"Theres a steep learning curve, which is hard to get over at first but once you get a hang of the navigation and hotkeys the game is godly. Theres a loose storyline which you are destined to follow (although you dont really have to). The game is very open ended and you can pretty much go where ever you want straight from the beginning which is a nice thing to be able to do. Recommend playing on easy the first time around. Character creation determines how you will interact with your surroundings and how you will play the game giving it excellent replay value.a good buy."
4,worth it,"I had played a demo of the game, it was great so I thought that I would get the actual game. It was better then I thought. On my first try I got massacred when I tried to leave the first region by mid-leveled bandits. Still love the game, but that had me suprised at how different it is. I like playing these games, that's why I thought on getting it, it was fun to play."
5,A classic!,"This is a great game. Its an epic and engrossing adventure. Its one of the best RPG's of all time. If you like RPG's you cannot go wrong with this game.You start out as a level 1 character (you get to pick among all the base AD&D; 2nd edition character classes) and you have to work HARD to gain a level. By the end of the game you will be lucky to get to level 7 and every level you advance is a real accomplishment. This is not a Diable style hack and slash, it requires and incredible amount of strategy, tatics, long term planning, and plain good luck.This is a classic AD&D; game that comes as close as the computer can to the tabletop experience. You get drawn in and truly feel like your a part of this world as you play. You'll lose a lot of sleep over this game. Buy it and enjoy! Say good bye to the loved ones and they won't see you again for months."
5,Fantastic RPG,"Baldur's Gate is a fantastic game! Baldur's Gate continues to amaze and impress however if you're looking for a quick kill this RPG does not fit the bill. Baldur's Gate has good graphics by today's standards and has an impressive story line which is somewhat linear in nature. The story allows the player to do what they wish. Multitudinous side quests coupled with flexibility in characters allow the game to be played many times over which offers hours upon hours of play. The interface is well organized and easy to use, the music, story line, and great technical aspects of the game immerse the player into the story. Bioware is notorious for their thorough game testing resulting in outstanding reliability. There is one patch available for download on the Bioware web page along with another update that allows for support of DirectX 8.0. You can't go wrong with this title."
4,good if it plays on modern machines with Audigy,"BG/ToSC are excellent games. Excellent. But They have a few problems running on modern sound cards. Audigy and Phillips Acustic Edge. 'Odviously' Phillips didn't make sound cards when these games were released and Audigy certainly wasn't around.(niether was the Live! 5.1 for that matter) I hope this release includes some kind of patch to run on modern machines. If it doesn't I won't be buying it, most anyone who would be interested in Baldur's Gate has a copy(hopefully legit) And re-releasing the already released is pointless unless it has improvements and/or fixes."
1,It defines Linear games.,I've been playing RPG's since Final Fantasy. This game was a way to linear for me. Not enough freedom of choice. The Dungeon and Dragons; Might and Magic were my favorite type of game. You could walk anywhere as long as you had enough food.~R~
5,When life hits you like a truck... listen to Paul Thorn!,"I first heard Paul a year ago and was hooked. This one is by far my favorite album, but all his music is awesome! Can't ever get tired of hearing him. His kinda bluesy rock sound is uplifting to me. Definately motivating on a gloomy day. I subject all my co-workers to a daily dose. LOL! I recently saw him live. Had played his cd's all day before I went to the show. Man it just made it better! He and his crew are a great performers all the way around (on the cd and on the stage.)"
4,Mission Temple Fireworks Stand - Paul Thorn,"Paul suffers from that rare problem of being very talented but can't be pigeoned holed in a genre like the record companies like to do. I saw him live and was an instant convert!""Rise Up"", is a great song about nmotivating yourself in a time of trouble""Ain't Living in Sin No More"", is a prime example of how people view a relationshipThe Title track is a page out of ""quirky"" AmericaIf you like this you are going to love his latest albumn ""Are You With Me?"""
4,Paul Thorn - Mission Temple Fireworks Stand,Songs Include :1. Everybody Looks Good at the Starting Line2. Rise Up3. Downtown Babylon4. Mission Temple Fireworks Stand5. Things Left Undone6. There's Something Out There7. Even Heroes Die8. Ain't Livin' in Sin No More9. Sister Ruby's House of Prayer10. Angel Too Soon11. Nothin' But the Devil12. I'm a Lucky Man
3,portable dvd player,I bought this for my sons to watch when we take long trips. It worked great for about a year. It now stops or freezes about half way through a movie. I called the manufacture but since I didn't buy the extended warranty I would have to pay them to just look at it and they wanted way too much to even look at it.
1,Not a long term investment,"Bought this DVD player to take on trips. I average about 3 trips per year on an airplane and thought this would be a good way to pass the time. It worked twice. Now I load a dvd into the unit and it says ""loading"" and never moves from that screen. It wont play movies or cd's. So now I have a $130 paper weight that the manufacturer wont back up with out an extended warranty. My plan to use it on trips then put it away until the next trip hoping it would last a long time since I only use it a few times a year was a pipe dream. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT !"
5,Beerzone oi punx/Buy this,"This is my moms name, it sucks not having a credit card.I saw Beerzone live twice now and they are great live and this cd is great too. Good sing along songs which are fun at concerts especially since I saw them in a little punk club in Green Bay(Concert Cafe/Rock n Roll High School RIP). Buy this if you like punk,oi,or having a good time listening to music. Best songs:Viagra,Ernie,Gazza Gazza,Saturday Night Beaver, and Jerry Springer but all are good. See them in concert ad you won't be disappointed even if you don't like punk. V-I-A-G-R-ABuy Strangle all the Boybands too."
2,Ancient Reprint is Showing Its Age,"This reprint of a 1971 book is showing its age. A lot of jokes have context that the current reader can not know or relate to. I wonder if a lot of them were that good at the time. As a reference it may have current value when looking for a joke in a specific context. All the jokes are by subject. The only Sure Fire is to burn this book. It is fascinating to see what you can sell once you get a name. I have belatedly discovered that jokes books are not of much value in public speaking. At two jokes per penny it is more that twice as expensive than ""3500 Good Jokes for Speakers by Gerald F Lieberman"" See my review of that book."
1,Tastes bad,"Got this because of the good review here, and brought it from another site. Glad I didn't get the pack of 12. It has a bit of a ""puke-ish"" smell. Made it with ground beef. Stick to black pepper and other seasonings. This just makes it taste bad. Like a light Teriyaki that someone vomitted. Sorry to be graphic. But that's how it was to me. Will not buy again."
5,funny,"My kids enjoy all the Veggies Tale books but they like the ""Mess Detective"" series best. They are always good for a laugh and moral lesson."
5,"The Complete diving Guide,",This is one of the most thorough and up to date dive travel books I've ever read. We used a lot of the information on diving and related material on our recent trip to P.R. and found it very helpfull and accurate.
2,Not very high quality,These were a bonus when I ordered another product so I can't really complain. They are just thin with not very thick duster part. Glad I did not buy them as a stand alone product.
2,You're better off getting a different slipper,"I bought these for the utility and b/c they were the cheapest ones listed. They are yarn-bottom and not microfiber. They are crinkly b/c construction is several rows of yarn loops sewn to a plastic ""sheet"" in the middle. The plastic is what causes the crinkles when you move your feet. I put them in the wash twice (once in a laundry sack) and the plastic has split in several places, like, down the entire length. As comfy as they are, the construction is something to be desired. It's worth it to spend a few extra dollars on an all-fabric, microfiber slipper."
5,ASTOUNDING,"Great conversation starter at boring funerals.In fact, I don't even wear normal shoes anymore.Let's not get onto the topic of well-waxed bank floors, the fun is simply incalculable."
2,Not durable,Began to delaminate and unstitch themselves immediately. Like the second use. Fit was too narrow for my broad foot. They could have used stretch fabric for an adjustable fit.
1,Fell apart in first wash,Fell apart in first wash and left blue balls of fabric clinging to every item in the washing machine. Do not purchase if you plan to wash them!
4,Fun and addictive mystery series,"I was randomly looking for a fun mystery series to watch, having exhausted a lot of the BBC fare, when I accidentally stumbled upon this Canadian treat. Set in late 19th C Toronto, the mysteries cleverly interweave the most fascinating people and inventions of the period (Nikola Tesla, Arthur Conan Doyle, Houdini, x-rays, the motorcar etc.) with solid mystery stories. The mysteries are somewhat formulaic but an appealing cast, led by the very handsome Yannick Bisson as the stoic and cerebral Murdoch, keeps things moving. The show also takes on some of the biggest controversies of the time that resonate in the 21st C, such as the tension between religion and science, the rights of women and minorities, and the privileging of the rich and powerful over everyone else."
4,detective,good series and i love CRABTREE the sidekick the female soroner is an interesting addition as at that time i don't think they even recognized women doctors.
1,Acorn: THINK OF THE HEARING IMPAIRED,"I really get upset to see so many good movies without closed caption; is it really too expensive to add subtitles to these movies. We view cc movies and would like to purchase them, even when they are expensive, but Acorn (the worst of the group) doesn't provide closed caption, altho they have started to put SDH (a subtitle) on newer movies. Couldn't they go back a few years and do the same with other fine movies? And really make an effort for cc with the new ones they are releasing?"
5,A Mystery series that is fun to watch......,"I never saw this series on PBS, but I saw a trailer and thought it was something I would like. It is different than any of the other mystery shows. Each story is different. It is very entertaining and I wish that they had made more shows. It is the only series I remember seeing that has police officers riding around on bicycles. You might call the show early CSI. The actors are all good in their roles. If you like mystery shows, then you should enjoy this series."
5,A CAPTIVATING JOURNEY!,"Blend a cup of mystery with a splash of history, mix in a sprinkling of intrigue, spice it with romance, top it off with a dash of humor and present it against beautiful Toronto in 1895 and you have have a great recipe for a most enjoyable program!"
4,Good Series,We just happened to get the first series and was supprized how entertaining the series is. I would like to see more. This is a combination of the Wild Wild West series with forensics that keeps you wanting more in a canadian setting. The characters work well together and you keep waiting for more to happen between them.This is a good entertaining series and we recommend it for anyone to see.
3,history in a mystery,Love watching each episode there's a little bit of history to every mystery. that makes it more fun share with a younger viewer. it and lets you apply science to a real life situation even with the bodIes right in the open not to graphic .
3,Christmas Gift,Another gift for one of my granddaughters. This was a Christmas gift for 2011 Christmas. I do not believe she plays with it anymore.
5,great fun,"My four year old son goes back to this game over and over again. It's a fun and engaging game that can be played in a number of different ways, even, as we play it, non-competitively. And we love playing it with him. It's a fun for all ages game."
5,zingo,"My son still likes to play this, 6 months after he got it. It was his absolute favorite toy for 2 solid months. Highly recommend"
4,Great Toy for Toddlers,"Got this toy for our 3 year old initially since it was a game he could play on his own (i.e. without mommy or daddy having to hold his hand). It has proven out to be just that, picture matching is something right up his alley. What we didn't expect was how well our 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl would get into it. They both love to play this game as its very engaging and competitive. The nice thing about this game is its card delivery. Its very easy even the 3 year old can be in charge. The slider is very easy to use and moves freely with barely any effort. The tiles are also solidly made and won't break or ware out.Overall this is a fantastic game for young and old."
4,Zingo is fun!,"My 3 1/2 year old son loves Zingo. All you do is make sure all the yellow tiles are in the holder facing the right way and you push the slider and pull it back and instantly, there are two tiles showing. The first person to claim the tile for their board, gets it. I love the fact that there is two sides to the very durable boards. One is for younger children, which is less competitive than the other side. The object is to claim the tiles that match on your bingo board as soon as you can. For younger children, it takes them a bit longer to find the matching picture, so on the easier side, there aren't very many of the same pictures on the boards, therefore, even if it takes them a little while to see it, at least the other player didn't snag it from them. It gives the little ones a chance to win even if they are playing with an older child. Love it!!!"
5,Great Toy,We bought this game for our granddaughters 3rd birthday. Very well made and durable. She is learning along with having a fun time. This game will provide many years of enjoyment.
5,Great Game!!,I bought this for Christmas for my 4 and 5 year old boys. They love it! It's a very fun game that they can play over and over again! This will become one of our favorite games to play.
5,Fun Game,"My kids ages 6, 4, and 3 love this game. They are able to get the game out, play with it, and put it away all by themselves!!! I love hearing them laugh and giggle while playing."
5,2 and 5 year olds won't stop playing it,"My kids got this for Christmas and 15 days or so later they are stilling playing it everyday. We've taken it out places too and it's very portable. I love the robust plastic pieces and the quality of everything. So many games are made so cheap these days and this is not. A refreshing change.What also impresses me if that I can play this game with a 2 and 5 year old and they can straight up beat he grown ups. I also love how they have come up with their own affectionate names for some of the shapes (funny face, stinky foot, birthday cake, etc).Brilliant game."
5,Great for Preschoolers,"My five-year-old and three-year-old love this game! It's like Bingo, but with pictures/words. You slide the ""dealer"" forward and back to reveal two tiles at a time. Each tile has a picture and a corresponding word. Each player has a card with various pictures/words corresponding to the tiles. If you have that picture/word on your card, you say the word out loud, and then put the tile on your card. The winner is the player who fills their card first. Each card has a red side and a green side. The red side is for older players, and the green side is for younger players. It appears that the red side utilizes only a subset of the total available tiles, making it a bit more difficult to fill your card (i.e., all of the potential tiles are represented on the green cards, but only some are represented on the red cards). When a player fills his card, he yells ""Zingo!"""
4,Zingo,"This is a good toy for language development, matching and learning to play a game. It is a good first game for a four year old."
5,Great game for the whole family!,This is such a fun game for the whole family. I have two kids ages 4 and 6 and we play all of the time.
2,Zingo for a 5 year old BOY!,"Zingo is like Bingo with pictures instead of numbers. My grandson liked it at first and so did I, however by the third game he was ready to turn the cards over to the harder sides, was ready to play two cards at the same time, plus two cards for me, plus two cards for his teddy bear--all at the same time. The tiles, while very durable, must be loaded into a gadget--a timeconsuming, no fun chore that will be left to the parent or older child. And it is harder the bigger fingers you have. I like this as an alternate game, but not if you only just want to buy one to refresh your game stock."
2,Just Another Yelling and Gabbing Game,"It's hard to put the plastic chips into the dispenser slot. I see no need for the chip dispenser to have a cover. The play cards were warped when received, and still are. This is just another yelling and grabbing game, with matching, and little thinking."
4,Good For The Little Guys,"This is a fun and durable game.Both of my children enjoy playing this and I don't mind it.But I don't care for the competitiveness of it, you have to be the first one to call out Zingo in order to get the tiles you need for your card.And the slider that dispenses the tiles is a little hard for my four year old to operate.Overall I like it.My son who is four loves it!"
4,Great game for young children,"When we purchased this game my children were two and four. The four year old loved zingo but the two year old had a difficult time understanding the entire concept, but expected. A year later and now both my children love this game. We play it weekly and it has yet to lose it fun value. It is extremely durable...plastic component has been dropped repeatedly. A great way to work on memory and the initial game rules for developmental skills. I would highly recommend this product for young children!"
4,One of my 3 yr. olds favorite games,My 3 year old son got this for Christmas and loves it. It's very easy for him to play and fun for us too. He has asked to play it everyday since Christmas!
4,Our 3 year old loves this toy.,"My daughter received this for her third birthday. She loves this game, and requests to play it with us fairly often. I thought of a way to change the game when she gets a bit older and begins to learn to read. When you slide the red box to reveal the tiles, you can slide it slowly so that it just reveals the words and not the pictures - so we could reveal only the words and challenge her to see if she can match the words to her Zingo card. The game has been wonderful for teaching her sportsmanship because if we beat her to a tile, she has to learn to wait until that tile shows up again. If she gets the tile first, she says, ""Don't worry, Mommy, you'll get it next time!"""
3,Zingo disappointed us.,"I bought this based on the quality and reliability of Think Fun games. We were disappointed, in that it didn't seem to engage the kids (ages 4) any more than regular Bingo. It was harder for them to play alone, because each of the little yellow plastic picture tiles has to be neatly fit into the square machine. It's time consuming to separate and file the tiles to begin with, and it's hard for the kids to manipulate. I would save the money and stick to a regular bingo game that isn't so touchy and messy."
4,Still playing this game after many years,"I hate to mention this but we are still playing this game 4 years later. My girls are now 12 and 10. I bought this for my younger daughter who was 6 at the time. We love to play this game when we are bored. Now, I have an 18 month old boy and I know he will enjoy this game when he is older. I will be playing this game for many more years."
5,Fun and Educational - A must have game!,"I use to sell Discovery Toys and this was always one of our top sellers. I give it as a gift all the time and actually my friends are now giving it as their favorite gift. The kids love the unique dispensor and trying to get Zingo, while you will love the educational aspect of Zingo. As a Mom of a 3 1/2 and 5 year olds, this is a must in our home. Have fun with your kids!"
5,wonderful all around,"After a week at home w/ the flu we have played this numerous times and loved it each time, even my 19 month old has figured it out and loves it! Highly recommend!"
5,My daughter loves it,"We chose this game for our daughter's fifth birthday. The way it's done, the child sees words with every picture and the child has to say the word out loud before grabbing the tile. This will really help with her reading. (We even enjoy the game as well.)"
4,ThinkFun Zingo,Great product! Great vocabulary builder and fun for kids young and older. I bought it to play with my 3 year old and he loves it.
4,Out of Control,"Having now indulged in a marathon reading session of four of Ms. Brockman's SEAL series books, I find that the theme of older woman/younger man love is becoming predictable. It leads to want to ask if Ms. Brockman is older than her husband, which is okay as my mom married a younger man,my father, or is this a formula that is difficult to change because of publisher desires?Ms. Brockman does write well in this genre."
2,Too much going on,Ms.Brockmann has too many stories going at once. The main characters Wild Card or as I call him CryBaby and his love interest were interesting. The grandmother who was a spy during WWII was interesting. But the missionary and the opportunist drag the story down.Perhaps I am being a bit harsh because I couldn't figure out what the hell happened to the Starlett story line. How does this make him a good man when more people are miserable than happy? I guess I am asking for too much. I just thought the story was sophisticated and perhaps it would continue to develop its characters without cliches but I was wrong and i will say it again sadly disappointed.
1,weak,"The book started on a good note, seemingly fast paced but then fell off in the middle. My biggest problem with the book was how weak Ken was. He kept refering to himself as a loser. Come on now I don't want to be reading a book with a ""loser"" hero!I liked the Molly/Jones story and would love to find out what happened once Jones went to Africa."
3,Terrible reading of the book,"This was the first of Suzanne Brockmann's novels I had listened to. The plot was OK, but the readerwas very wooden, like she was reading a first grade story book. There was very little expression, noacting out of the characters, etc and it made for an unfulfilling listen."
2,Couldn't even get through it,"I think all authors go through a time where the series they are writing kind of taper off...and I think this is it for Brockmann's troubleshooters. I couldn't even finish this, after I got to about half, I just had to let it go. Not worth your time, but give the other books a try, I know I will."
5,The most entertaining book I have ever read!,"I cannot CANNOT!!! wait until the next installment in the series hits the shelf. This book had everything - non-stop action, hilarious dialogue, FOUR romances, and some very hot situations. I loved Wildcard - in the other books he's been seen as a complete screwup, not as the romantic hero of the story. I won't spoil it for anyone by giving away the storyline - but I don't think we have seen the last of Sam and Lys. I have to believe that Sam and Alyssa will get their Happy Ever After. (Hopefully in the next book - please Ms. Brockmann!) I loved the unexpected Molly/Jones story. If you want to read a book that will keep you up all night, this is it. Enjoy! Does anyone know when the next book will be released?"
3,Out of Control: The Molly and Jones story,"Yep, I thought this book was about Molly and Jones. I loved their story and thought it more superior than the main characters. Brockmann's books are just too busy for me and I read this one based on a recommendation. It turned out to be better than Brockmann's previous Troubleshooters books. I still love and enjoy rereading Heart Throb. Her best book in most humble opinion and also, The Admiral's Bride despite the leer factor that usually is a huge part of her Brockmann's stories.Anyway, I look forward to reading more of Brockmann sans SEALs one day in the future. Glad to see that Brockmann has finally arrived and is such a hit with readers. I wish her continued success with this series and I will always be on the look out for more of her original stories.My over all grade of this book is: B-"
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"Out of all the books in Brockmann's SEAL Team 16 series, I enjoyed this one the most. The plot is rivetting and complex. Each character, and there is a multitude of them, is amazingly well-developed so you 'feel' for each one of them. The setting is exotic and compelling in and of itself. And I even enjoyed the secondary story she wove through this one. In the past I've skimmed over them, but this one I enjoyed and it fit into the main story really well. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the way the story between Locke and Starrett ended up. But the series isn't over yet... It was just a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a fantastic read! I can honestly say that this is one of the best books I've ever read."
5,Suzanne Brockmann has done it again!!,"One again a wonderful story from my favorite author!!.The story is very fast paced, and the chemistry between all the characers is remarkable!.If you are a fan of Suzanne Brockmann and her ""team of Navy Seals"" you must read this book.We really get to know and love these men!. I can't wait until the next one."
2,So-so.,"I guess I'm on my own with this review. I tried Suzanne Brockman for the first time based on all of the good reviews for this book. I was very disappointed. I finished the book because it was the only one I brought with me on vacation. Otherwise, I would have stopped reading it and moved on to another book. The characters in this book weren't very likeable -- especially Wild Card. He ""fell in love"" WAY too quickly, and started making marriage plans right away. Come on. I don't see how that's an attractive characteristic."
2,Did anyone else notice?,"I slogged through this book just wanting to see how the author would end the all too many story lines. Some of it was interesting. But I had a difficult time believing anything in the story after the mistake in chapter 4. Earlier the characters Ken and Savannah discuss (at Ken's house) the fact that he was a SEAL. He even accuses Savannah of being a ""SEAL groupie"". Then in chapter 4 Savannah ""slips"" and says he is a SEAl, and he gets mad! What was up with that? Am I the only one who noticed? Ms. Brockman needs to slow down a bit, not have so many story lines and try to keep her own story straight. This was one of the worst books I've ever wasted a weekend trip with!"
3,just okay.,"I actually liked the Rose/Hank substory more than the Savannah/Wildcard story. It wasn't anything glaring, I just liked some of Brockmann's other books better."
4,"Not her best, but still pretty good","I guess because Ken Karmody was portrayed as such an immature jerk in Brockmann's previous Navy Seal novels, I just couldn't sympathize with him much. I also had a hard time picturing him as a heartthrob. Also, I didn't find Savannah as compelling as this author's previous heroines. Nonetheless, this author is such a good writer that I couldn't put this book down. The sub-characters Molly and Jones were really the stars of this book, and their love story was mature, touching and fulfilling. And, as always, the Alyssa/Sam love story is also intriguing. Unlike other reviewers, I find the World War II love stories quite boring. The WWII plot in the first Navy Seal book was interesting and unexpected, but this one just seemed gratuitous, forced and very predictable. Other than that, quite a good read."
3,"""Wildcard"" is creepy in begining, but story is good.","""Wildcard"", falls in love with this woman about 10 minutes after he meets her. Sorry, but that just gave me the creeps! Other than sending me red flags with ""NUTCASE"" in bold letters, I got really involved with the characters and could not put the book down. If you like action romance you should definitly give this book a try."
4,Exciting Action,"Good fiction. Fast paced and exciting, and the characters were well developed. Hard to put down."
3,Informative but limited,"This dvd was informative as a standard biography, however there is not much in terms of extras on the disk. The DVD format provides an opportunity for a topic such as this to be covered richly. Unfortunately that is not the case with this disk."
5,A True Engelbert Fan must,"This is the classic Engelbert ""then and now"", his very beginning, with him ""now"" talking about ""then"". What a treasure."
5,Fantastic,"An audio course is absolutely the best way to study the history of music. Greenberg is a great guide, consistently interesting, enthusiastic, and funny. He provides historical context of the times as well as analysis of the music itself."
5,For the serious history buff!,Everything you ever wanted to know and more. Lots of illustrations; detailed campaign history; includes fold out maps.
5,A source book for graphic design,I first saw this book at a friend's house. Within 2 days I found it on line and ordered it. I use it often to develop embellishing ideas.
5,"Makes caring for our turtle tank easy! Works with garden hose, too!","We bought this to take care of our turtle tank. As our turtles grew the water got worse and we had to change the water more often, and the bucket system was getting old...With this thing you just hook it up to your sink and like magic the water disappears! We were heartbroken when we installed a new faucet in the kitchen which had no place for an adapter... But lo and behold, if you unscrew the brass adapter on the valve, it will screw onto a garden hose! So now we just run the hose out a window and water the lawn while we're changing water.One tip for the people breaking their plastic parts... The rubber seals are what's going to keep the connections from leaking. Stop tightening the valve just after you start to feel some resistance. The rubber seal doesn't need that much pressure to seal up. Don't overtighten the connection and you won't break it!"
5,Long Nguyen,This is a great product. I love it. The following are the reasons why I love it:1. Retail price at Petco is $59.99. I paid about %40 less.2. It is made in the U.S.A.3. Its quality.4. Easy to use.5. I could store it anywhere.6. I used it twice and had no problems so far.7. It would take as twice as amount of time for getting the same job done if I were still using the pail.
5,Great product makes water changes fast and easy,"Beats a bucket any day of the week. I have a little 10 gallon tank and I can ""drain and fill"" my water changes in less then 10 minutes.a must have for any aquarium ownerAlso it's MADE IN THE USA!"
5,Awesome,This product is AWESOME! I had my doubts about the price but it is definitely worth it. What would take me a hour to clean my tank (filling and emptying buckets and the mess) now takes about 15 minutes without the mess. It is simple to hook up and use. I will never go back to the old ways of buckets.
3,Great thus far - but do not like being duped,"okay I am deducting two stars for one reason onlyi purchased this item and noticed that if o added the Python brass tap adapter i would get it just a tad cheaper. But the product already had a adapter of the exact same modle included in the main product.Meaning i just spent an extra $8 for nothing.Why is there a addon deal of an item already included in the main purchase, but you guys dont mention it in product description?Amd before someone replies this is not a valid rating for the product yes it is as i was tricked into buying another item that i did not need."
5,What a back saver!,This product has been a life save! I would tell anyone who has a small or large aquarium that the need this product. Who would ever want to fill buckets of water to fill their aquarium...even if you have a smaller tank. I had orig purchased a reg gravel vac for my 55 gal tank. After I had read all the great reviews about this product and decided to return the gravel vac and purchase the Python.This has been the best purchase I have made for my tank. I do not dread cleaning my tank every week and my back is not hurting because of it. Def get this product if you are sick of filling up buckets for your water changes every week.
5,I don't know what I'd do without it!,"When I got my turtle, I never realized how hard it would be to clean the tank! I had bought a siphon cleaner before this... and it was the worst thing ever.. I would have water all over the place. Bucket after bucket of water being carried into the bathroom, then refilling the buckets with more dirty water, having to move in and out of the tank to suck in the gravel and etc.. HARD WORK!!Then I looked online for something better and saw the Python no spill clean and fill. I wasn't sure if I should buy it at first because it seemed so hard to use, and wasn't sure how it worked. Then I received it, and honestly, I've never been happier to clean my tank! It's AMAZING how fast it gets the job done. It attaches to your faucet and uses water pressure to suck in the dirty water from the tank, then when you're ready to fill it up again, all you have to do is turn the green tube on the end and it'll fill right up!"
5,My first time using the Python,"After reading reviews about the Python and finaly reading about it on DrFosterSmith.com i bought one.All i can say is WOW,why didnt i buy this befor.I have a 55 gallon and a 30 gallon aquarium,i cleaned and refilled both in less time then the 30 took by it self.It isnt often you find a product that works so good that you can kick yourself in the butt because you didnt buy it sooner.I will admit,the reason i put off buying one befor was the price.But after buying it and using it,i cant believe how much work and time it saves.I would say its best for tanks over 20 gallons,it has a strong vacum and your water level drops pretty fast,my 30 dropped pretty quick compared to my old gravel vacs,so if your going to use it on a 20 or smaller,watch it closely.But its worth every penny,easy to hook up and use,no mess,no buckets,no heavy lifting,one year warranty,Python has plenty of replacement parts.In my opinion,its a must have."
4,Python 25 ft No Spill Clean & FIll Gravel Vac System,"This is the best product I have found thus far for cleaning and re-filling my 135 gallon tank. I only wish it drained a little faster. After researching the product, I was a bit concerned about the durability of the plastic connector piece that attaches to the faucet; however, I was greatly suprised and appreciative of the fact that the company took the initiative to upgrade the kit and replace the plastic connector piece with one made of heavy brass. The pump portion only squirted a little until I moved the valve to the proper position so the water could flow into the tank prior to siphoning. It siphoned and refilled smoothly. It also emptied easily when I was finished. I hope it stores just as easily."
5,Star Value,"I am delighted to say I have had a copy of this book for several years and each time i dip into it, there is something new and different for me.It did take a little while for me to realise just what a gem it is. I have been on a conscious path of spiritual growth for many years and took a while to realise what a useful resource it is for both old hands and folks new to the path of spiritual growth. There are many exercises and techniques to choose from and regular, gentle application bears fruit. It reveals its gifts through time,and as I look back to when I first began to study and apply the contents, I can see how it has supported my blossoming. It is also a very good book for a group of friends to explore in a study group format as well. I have used it as a title for one of my own classes, and students were very pleased. I see it as a valuable resource for a lifetime."
5,Excellent book on many levels!,"Orin is a master of revealing how to identify and work with the cause of a challenge, rather than simply to struggle with the symptoms of a conflict. By reading and re-reading each chapter, new answers and ideas will emerge for the reader. Soul Love by Sanaya Roman is a great companion for Spiritual Growth."
1,Save Your Money,"I keep an open mind when it comes to spiritual topics and can accept that we can develop more awareness with the Universe. This book, however, is not what I expected with all the meditations, visualizations, cocoons of light, etc. that are repeated over and over in a slightly different context. Plus, the ideas are too far out there for me. Wish I could get my money back from this one."
3,Customer satisfaction,"I purchased this book awhile ago and the reading was good. The material arrived on time, in good condition. It will be read over and over."
4,It's my second copy of the book,"It's a great book and I highly suggest it to help with a detailed method to ""re-center"" and basque in positive energy, but the quality of the used ""LIKE NEW"" condition... was not... very good. The cover was detached, there was some writing in the columns, and looked to have slight water damage. I don't mind it, but it wouldn't be appropriate to give as a gift."
2,A waste of perfectly good trees.,"After reading Lanning's book, one is left with the impression that America's MI community is comprised of total incompetents. Not only is this not true, but Lanning's book begs the question ""If these are all the failures, where are all the successes?"" The answers to this question would fill innumerable volumes (Saratoga, Antietam, et al.). Lanning needs to find a new day job and perhaps look beyond his own narrow field of experiences with the MI community."
1,Senseless Writing,"Lanning jumps on his petty position that military intelligence is to blame for all the military's shortcomings and never lets go. His arguments are shallow and unfounded. He then goes on to make some of the worst suggestions ever proposed, especially by by a military veteran--reduce our armed services to only an army and navy, shut down all but one of the service academies (he must be disappointed he couldn't get accepted to West Point)--what exactly do these issues have to do with the intelligence community? I just find it very interesting that someone who has never served as a military intelligence officer thinks he is a credible source on the subject. I guess he spent a little too much time in the infantry and lost his common sense."
3,A question of chickens and eggs,"We must all remember that nearly every military succes or failure is easly explainable in retrospect. Inteligence is among the most vulnerable department when it comes to analysis such as this. It is always possible to critisize the quality and quantity of information available when , after the fact, many more things come to light. This is not a strike against the author, it is a reminder to us all to be rational and to delicatly determine the circumstances surrounding us."
4,intriguess in the top high brass,failures considered fatal actions of the cia through civil war and the last two world wars; very interesting book for the new generations of army officers.
4,Has it all...except one thing,"This could be one of the greatest hard rock/metal bands. They've got a great sound, great lyrics, great passion for Christ, yet Mark Soloman's voice doesn't quite go with the rest. He needs some vocal coaching. It's obviously a strain to hit the higher notes and he comes off sounding like a cross between that whiny Robert Smith and a constipated Ozzy Osbourne. If you could imagine a voice like Chris Cornell in there, then Stavesacre would go down as one of the greatest bands in recent memory. But they're doing the Lord's work, and that's fine by me! Bless them."
5,The Prescence of God,"Stavesacre's third release on Tooth and Nail ""Speakeasy"" is brilliant song writing married with incredible introspective lyrics. Mark Soloman's impassionate voice enables Stavesacre to build a sonic ocean which churns, rises, falls, and swells. From the opening track ""Minuteman"", one clearly sees the brilliance in the lyrics and harmonies. The musicianship found in the band is well crafted, always fitting the lyrical mood perfectly with the right notes. Journeying through each riveting track to its final destination, ""This Love"" brings listeners out of this world and into the prescence of God. Stavesacre's music is brilliant, and is capable of transcending one's spirit from this world into another. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves heavy rock, not so much hard. But heavy. It is intellegent music.It deserves much more than Five Stars."
4,oh this is good,"mark solomon is the man . and that's the bottom line. after having read an article about how they wanted to get away from their ""tool"" comparisons, ""speakeasy"" should do nothing more than solidify stavesacre with their own style and sound. alternative of ""non contemporary"" Christian music always walks a fine line between staying true to the music and trying to deliver a positive message. stavesacre are the masters of doing just that and this album proves it. this is by far their catchiest album and yet they didn't lose any of their hard sound. the addtion of a new guitartist to the mix has really developed their sound and new and old fans alike will be pleased with this album."
5,My fav band,"These guys are my most favorite band ever. I bought their cd about 5 years ago, and liked a few songs, but couldn't quite feel the voice or the beat, cuz i liked the mainstream sound that everyone else did. After Speakeasy came out, I heard Gold and Silver and got chills. His voice can carry out for so long, and the way it builds up sent chills all over my body. They also have the song Wither/Ascend that i want played at my funeral. If you hate hard rock, or rock in general, then buy this cd for the lyrics, they will amaze you. Mark has a passion for Christ and his music, and it's evident in his heart pounding lyrics. The way they integrate the music into the lyrical side is chilling almost. There are a few songs that i don't care too much for, but the lyrics on them are still incredible. I went to a concert, and heard some of the new songs. I will be the first in line to buy it. I definetly recommend this cd, because they rule. And so do project 86!"
3,It's Alright,"An okay CD. ""So I Got To Groove"" is a great song. It's better live though. I'm not sure if I recommend this CD or not. Probably not, but it's not a BAD cd. Just not very good."
2,I Don't Get the Hype,I didn't get what was so great about this cd. Most of the songs were too repeative with nothing interesting going on. Avoid purchasing if you don't like chillout music with singing.
4,I was SO misled...,This book is adorable in idea... but Mickey was nowhere to be found... which disappointed ME because he IS my husband (that whole Minnie thing is a sham). It's full of all of the Disney characters telling why they LOVE Mickey. I just wished Mickey HIMSELF was in the book more than just on the cover. It's basically a picture book with a small caption from each character... very cute.But there still should have been more Mickey!
2,Not Form Fitting,After spending a week reading every review for a Palm TX hard case I could find I decided that the PDair case was the best so I ordered it. Unfortunately when it arrived I realized it had a major flaw. It is NOT form fitting. It is actually shaped completely differently and quite a bit larger than it should be. This causes not only there to be a large air pocket in the case that lets my palm rattle around but also makes my slim palm twice as bulky as it originally was. Having already bought the clear case (which while not the best looking case is the most functional and I do recommend it if you have to make a choice) I decided to modify the PDair case. I removed the back plate and cut the latch off. Now its just a tad bit thicker but it completely covers the front of the palm.
2,Hard to Use,"The color was good, but I had trouble putting this on my hair. Get help if you want it to look good. It was not worth the trouble because it washes out right away. Something like mascara with a brush would have been easier to use."
3,Cover Your Gray Pofessional Touch Up Dark Brown Waterproof Formula,"The product is fine - it just wasn't the color I hoped it would be; normally when I order Dark Brown, I get what I consider dark brown. This is more black. But that is to be expected I guess. I wouldn't order the product again."
4,works as described,"this cable works as described and seems to be quite durable. when i plugged it in the first time, it worked...as expected. for the price, it was a steal."
2,Don't buy this junk,This is a pathetic waste of money. The Light Saber comes apart and the only way to get it to stay together is with glue. why this was made in two peices is beyond me. the glue ended up not working either. the droid wont stay together long enough to get blown apart so we ended up gluing it as well. O yeah it does'nt stand up well either. all in all a very poorly desinged peice of [garbage].My son is very disappointed with this....
1,Beads Not Soft,These beads are not soft at all. They are hard plastic and I was expecting soft rubber beads. Also I paid $4.50 and then a few days later they were $2.50. I was disappointed in this purchase and think I will be returning them.
2,Painful Star bead,"This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically."
2,disappointing,"I was expecting a college comedy with plenty of college girl T&A. But the T&A was minimal, only a couple of quick scenes. And the movie was only slightly entertaining. Since the movie wasn't very entertaining for me (a male), and most of the stars of the movie are female...and the males in the movie are portrayed as idiots (fools), and the plot is mostly about girls trying to get into a sorority....I'm thinking this movie must be a ""chick flick""...a movie for girls. Guys will hope to see enough college girl nudity to be interesting, but they will be disappointed. Some Paris Hilton fans may like the movie, but be sure to note that Paris Hilton does not get naked in this movie (...but a few other girls get topless). I wouldn't be surprised to see some girls disagreeing with my assumption that this movie is a ""chick flick""...maybe its just a little dull for everyone...(barely watchable)."
1,God awful,"Paris a good actress? Movie simply amazing? Clearly a large amount of viewers have no taste in quality movies and/or acting.What cracked up mind came up with this movie? All of the acting is horrible, the cinematography abysmal, and the plot is pretty much nonexistent.While it is a film I will never recommend to someone for it's cinematic value, I would recommend it to people who want a good laugh, but it's not necessarily because of the humor, it's because of how awful this movie is.Paris Hilton was apparently an executive producer.....first, it has become clear this chick has no talent and should not be working behind ANY camera(or in front of), second, did Hilton even go to college? Everything that happens in this disaster is supposed to be a portrayal of college life. WTF, nothing like what happens in this rotten piece of filth happens in college."
3,Expected more,You usually go into a national lampoon movie thinking you will be relatively entertained. While this almost ends up doing the job it didnt look like it was professionally done...more like it was made by a couple of college kids. The editing wasnt all that slick. Some of the jokes were dumb. Expected more really. Nothing to write home about.
1,Just plain bad.,"This is not a good way to carry on a tradition for national lampoon (I can't believe this could be associated with clasics like vacation and animal house). This movie was just plain aweful, in the worst way. Bad acting, bad script, and paris hilton basically playing herself. This thing had only a few mildly amusing parts, but overall did not flow well at all. Just save the cash, let this sit on the shelf and rot."
1,Step one to recovery...BURN THIS DISC!!!,"Wow, I would have never have guessed it to be this bad. How the heck did National Lampoons fall so far. And Paris Hilton...Why? She is not so HOT. I will never say the word HOT after this film, I will always refer to it as ""the opposite of cold"". Just bad all around. Blockbuster would be mad at me for burning this, but I will be saving many other Bored guys who thought this movie might have been entertaining. Wow, embarressed that I even took the time to write this review under my name its so bad."
1,Dud Crud!,"I purchased this travesty because I mistook it for the way National Lampoon USED TO BE, but not anymore.Seems they will put anything or anyone in front of a camera today and call it entertainment..I apologize for the 1 star, but Amazon won't allow a lower rating...It's all my fault, for sitting through most of this whatever you call it...Another 90 minutes of my life, wasted.."
1,If you nothing else to do,"Paris Hilton is probably the most overrated ugly girl I have ever seen. I think she is up to 14:59 minutes of fame, and it should expire after this movie. I had to turn this movie off within the first thirty minutes. The movie is horrible, so don't waste your time or money."
2,What Was I Thinking,"All I can say is I'm glad I only paid 99 Cents for it. Was sooooo bad I couldn't make it to the end. If you liked ""Band Camp"" or""Euro Trip"" you might enjoy it. If you're an adult I'de say don't waaste your time."
1,just plain bad!!!,"I can not believe this carries the National Lampoon's name, and can be associated with Animal House and Vacation. This movie was just plain bad, did not flow well, poor acting, and paris hilton and the other gals of Gamma Gamma were hideous twigs (with thick make up, poor teeth from vomiting, and bags under their eyes from hangovers). Paris played herself, a spoiled rich girl, but what could one expect. For as highly advertised as this was, big let down. There were a few amusing spots, but the rest could be watched in fast forward. Let this one rot."
1,Paris sucks as an actress or anything else for that matter...,This was an AWFUL movie. If I could give it zero stars I would have but Amazon forces you to at least give it one star. Don't waste your time. Thank heavens I didn't have to pay to see this because if I did I would have been horrified. Paris Hilton is an awful actress--she acts just like she does in real life---really badly!
5,One of my favorite albums from the early '80's...,"I fondly recall purchasing this album back in '83 while stationed at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Previously, the only Walsh album I'd bought was '81's 'There Goes The Neighborhood', which definitely had its high and low points. Personally, I found 'You Bought it, You Name it' a more consistently listenable effort, with my favorite tunes being 'Love Letters', 'Class of '65', and of course 'I.L.B.T's' which only recently (2005) became a requested favorite here in Nashville on the local classic rock station. It wasn't long after this album and similar efforts were released that rock and roll was soon pushed aside by candy pop and ear-splitting rap, a fact that makes me treasure such classic tunes even more in my 'middle age'...thanks again, Joe."
3,"fun facts, nice graphics, though no ideas","Perhaps my sights are too high for cd-roms, but I would hope that they might teach kids to think more than merely entertain them with well-presented facts. Indeed, my daughter is becoming quite a reader of kids' science literature, which I think is definitely far better than this kind of software. While there are puzzles, this is largely a passive experience of clicking - with little cost if you guess wrong - and mini-movies and things to print. It passes the time, but teaches very little. Can't the producers introduce some notions, such as evolution, ecology, etc?Recommended as enterainment that can be construed as learning - if you stretch it."
5,High quality,"Great item at a reasonable price. Never once collapsed while siphoning water and has never leaked. Little pricy but worth the cost when you consider no spills, no collapsing, no mess!"
4,Good but not great,"I purchase a lot of watches online and I usually gift most of them. This one was also bought to be gifted to a relative. When I made the purchase, this listing was for the same watch but with grey background and no gold tone in the strap.The person for whom I bought this doesnt like flashy watches or any metal that will catch someones eye. He wanted a very sober looking watch which will look elegant when someone does notice it.This was a perfect fit for him and he loves this watch. He wears it everyday to office and I havent heard of any complaints from him so far. Please note that the picture shown now is not what I bought. The watch I bought is a very likable pleasant watch."
5,Still the best!,"These saltines have been around ever since the beginning of time, or so I think! You can even get antique tins in which these used to be sold. They're still the best in my book, have the best flavor, do the best job of keeping away the flu symptoms, and taste the best in soups and recipes. I don't buy anything else any more. I've tried them all just for fun and always have to come back to Premium. Highly recommend!"
2,LIVE; IF THAT AIN'T COUNTRY,ORDERED IN ERROR FOR CD. CASSETTE ARRIVED WITH A BROKEN CASE . DID NOT BOTHER TO CONTACT SHIPPER . TAPE WAS O-K . SERVICE WAS SLOW .
1,Buyer beware,"The controller shorted out on this little gem within the first hour of operation and I had to return it. Save yourself some grief, buy a different brand."
2,Not that great,"I read this book for an international studies class, but as an econ minor, i was really dissapointed. the book is targeted towards non-econ majors, i think, but it ended up just confusing most of my friends in the class who had no econ background. however, i did okay, not becuase of this book, but because of my own econ background that allowed me to fill in the gaps and understand the confusing explenations and definitions used in this book. there are better ways to say what gerber tried to say, in my opinion, so i would not recomend this book very highly. although it was decent, it could have been much better."
5,Wow! This works,"My doctor diagnosed my heel pain as plantar fasciitis. I had treatment for this condition for over 10 months and even had surgery on one foot to release the fascia. After 3 weeks on crutches I slowly started to use the foot again and within 5 days my pain level was right back to pre surgery level. In frustration I was searching the internet for other causes of heel pain and came across ""fat pad syndrome"". This is a thinning of the fat pad under the heel that can occur due to age and/or repetitive impact from activities such as running. I came across these heel cups and the reviews were good so for the low cost I decided to give them a try. Within 2 days my pain level dropped from 8 down to 2 on both feet. I've been wearing them now for a little over a week and at the end of the day my pain level has been around 1 which is tolerable. These made an amazing difference in my ability to get around."
2,Quality questionable,I have owned these for three months. One split and broke completely. The other one (not used much) is cracked and will have to also be trashed soon. Choices are limited as these are hard to find. I will search for some of better quality before buying more.
3,Heel cups,I bought these because I have a pair of dress shoes that constantly rub my heels. These cups do prevent my shoes from shredding my skin but I have a hard time walking in them as they are very slippery with socks. They also make the shoes a little smaller and I ended up with blisters on my toes instead of my heels!
5,Excellent,This product is the only thing that alleviates my foot condition and I order them often.Excellent service and prompt delivery.
5,Best device for a hurt heel,"I used to have this heel protector many years ago. When I hurt my heel a while ago I first tried a gel-style heel protector, but it was ineffective. I suspect it would be fine as a ""comfort"" device, but it offered too little protection to the injury. Highly recommend this item. Simple, rigid, does the job."
2,Not impressed,This was recommended and I certainly wish I had saved my money for another purchase. I may be donating to library or something 'cause I am very disappointed in it.
3,From great to good...,"This book had the potential to give attribution to the one who made it all, but rather we are left to imagine...An encouraging book, but could have been great."
5,Nelly Furtado is Super Hot,When did this transformation in Nelly take place? I'm telling you right now she is suddenly superhot! She and Timbaland have something special on Promiscuous. I listened to this CD 5 times straight the day it arrived. I love it.
1,"Only one Song on this CD, will not Respond to emails",A total ripoff......the add mentions a single but it is not made crystal clear that this is some sort of demo cd......with only one song.........way overpriced
3,It's Alright,"This product arrived with some odd blueing on one side of the water chamber, where the wall joins the base. Thankfully, it did not explode and kill me.I have been making espresso with this item for a while. I put Turkish coffee in it once and it was too much for it -- now I have to fill it half full with espresso grind or it does not work at all."
3,Works well,"I purchased this mini espresso maker in order to save space in my kitchen. The first one I received didn't screw on straight, so coffee spewed between the two pieces, but the replacement works well. The coffee brews incredibly fast on a medium-low gas flame....about 1 minute or so, but the coffee tastes and looks richest when on a low flame. The maker is small and sits a bit wobbly on the burner. Though the box indicates a yield of one double shot (2.5 oz), water will be left in the reservoir so if you want more than one shot of espresso, purchase the larger size. Unfortunately, I've only been able to get about 1 oz from each use, measured from beginning of pour to when the maker starts making that prolonged wheezing noise and nothing comes out. Could be user error or impatience, but when coffee stops coming out, then I figure the maker has finished brewing. The low yield precluded 5 stars."
2,Bottom doesn't screw on properly,"This looked so cute online, but it's not as pretty in person. The white spaces are really a sort of dirty cream color. Also, the bottom doesn't really screw on firmly, which makes me worry that it would come off if I tried to wear it. Definitely not worth the money."
4,Of Home and Hope and Family,"Somehow I missed this particular book when it came out, though I've been a Siddons fan for a long time. Interesting companion to her newest book NORA, NORA, with a similar pivotal character in virtually the same setting. This is a tale of coming home and discovering your history, with plenty of betrayal and love along the way. Micah Winship, works through a pretty awful childhood and becomes an award winning journalist, when her world collapses and she finds herself called back to Lytton, Georgia. Ms. Siddons is a Southern writer who can make you feel heat, humidity and actually breath the air along with her characters, who also breathe and live and languish. Excellent portrayal of the south with well sketched, believable characters. The story is thought provoking and hopeful."
3,Homeplace,A good Southern type story. Well written and kept my interest to the end. Since I am not from the South some of this seemed a little far fetched. It was a nice winter day read.
3,Homeplace,I have read most of Ms. Siddons books. This one is for anyone who has ever had a strained family relationship. She is really a great writer.
2,Typical Siddons,"After 20 years away from reading Siddons, this Kindle offering caught my eye, and the price didn't hurt. As expected, Siddons' characters are either tragically sad or smart and wounded. A strange sort of morality exists- in the sense that ""true love"" wins out over old fashioned little words like adultery. If you want romance at all costs, this book is for you. If you are an ardent feminist this book is for you. If you follow after the heart of God, not so much...."
2,Homeplace,"I thought the storyline was good. I found the descriptions of some of the characters in this book to be offensive, especially the character's sister DeeDee. I will probably not read another book by this author just because of this."
2,"Old antiques are good - old paprebacks, not so much",The condition of this used paperback is poor - so old the pages are dark yellow and fragile.I will not attempt to read this copy and wil just throw it away.I don't feel the bookseller should have sold this copy and I will not order from them again
3,Did Ms. Siddons really write this?,"Anne Rivers Siddons is my favorite modern author; however, ""Homeplace"" could very easily be her least impressive work. The bell jar metaphor is as overdone as charred steak and her veiled disdain for Mike's obese sister is disappointing. Did Siddons have a ghost writer on this one?"
2,Disappointing,"After reading Dorthea Benton Frank's endearing Lowcountry Tales, i was disappointed that this story of the south was so depressing. i never finished it and doubt that i'd buy another of this author's works."
4,Home Place,This book is a very good read. People are revealed in surprising ways. It kept me guessing. I will look for more books by this author.
2,Disappointment,"Not what I have come to expect from ARS. Took nearly half the book to get into the story and characters. Fortunately, I stayed with it and enjoyed it, but certainly not one of her best efforts."
3,Good price,"It was a good price for this book. I'm not done reading it, but is is a great Anne Rivers Siddons work of art! This book came exactly as described and in excellent condition!"
4,Africagirl,lots and lots of detailed drawings of species. Everything you could hope to see in one book which is nice when weight and space are considerations. Some people might wish for photos but those books are usually not as complete.
1,Absolutely ridiculous edition (if you can call it that) of Dahrendorf's book,"It appears that the folks at General Books have scanned this book and somehow dumped the words into a single document with NO FORMATTING WHATSOEVER!!!!!! I have never seen anything like this. Here is how my book begins, at the start of the first and only chapter:--------Hr (top"". Y""to DAVID LOCKWOOD and our common friends of the""Thursday Evening Seminar at the London School of Economics (ig 2 ig f) my fellow fellows at the Center for Advanced Study-------------AND SO ON UNTIL...---------Preface to the First (German) Edition In the middle of the twentieth century, the sociologist finds himself in an awkward position.--------------THE ENTIRE BOOK IS (NOT) FORMATTED IN THIS WAY. It is hard to even communicate how absurd this is. Unfortunately I desperately need the book for school and will not be sending it back, but I am just downright offended that I paid $35 for this nonsense. Shame on this ""publisher"". Absurd."
5,A remarkable debut,"Some of Us Have to Get Up in the Morning shows a remarkable gift for characterization and dialogue in strange but intriguing stories. The characters range from truck drivers to female impersonators--all of them almost painfully believable--in stories in which little appears to happen on the surface, but a lot is going on underneath. ""Cleanser,"" one of my favorites, is a great example of how Scott takes the ordinary (a cleaning woman who has been passed over for a promotion to supervisor)and transforms it into a profoundly human drama. Other exceptional stories include ""The Whereabouts of Me,"" ""Bypass,"" and especially ""Upside-down Heart,"" which has one of the most poignant endings I've ever read in a story. A very exciting new voice in American fiction."
3,"Lukewarm at best,","I read it. It was ok. I am not an incestuous homophobe but some of his writings made me feel that way. Yuck. ""Cookout"" was my favorite. Most of the stories seemed pointless and without a really satisfying ending.I bought this book at list price here in SF. $12."
3,Not What You're Expecting,"I bought this book thinking it contained maps and detailed trail descriptions for obscure Canyon paths, only to find that it did not. (If you want that, get Annerino's Sierra Club book, which is the best available that I've seen, and I have the Falcon Guide too, which is likewise more helpful than this work, though this one touches upon some tremendously obscure areas Falcon doesn't.)As a guide, this book is ok, but *definitely* insufficiently detailed. I found it fascinating and entertaining, but it should be called Harvey Butchart's Fairly General Descriptions of Grand Canyon Trails, Very Well Written, and With Stories About Many of These Trails.It was very frustrating to get the book without the highly detailed Butchart maps, which are alluded to (they show in red pen the paths and approaches he took, and in many cases, pioneered) but NOT INCLUDED.Butchart has led a hiking life for all of us to envy, as this book makes clear."
5,The most complete reference to the Grand Canyon I've found!,"Butchart's book is the only reference to about half the routes talked about in the book! Having hiked several of the routes in the book, ive found the descriptions to give just enough information to get you going in the right direction without taking away the adventure of it all by telling you every detail that you will experience. A must for Canyon hikers."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I was disappointed in this children's CD. My 3 year old daughter doesn't even want to listen to it. All the songs have a similar country sound, lyrics are stupid rather than silly. My advice is to take a pass on this one."
3,Decent arcade platformer,"This game isn't too hard. The concept makes very little sense... You play as a monkey which must fight agains sentinent fruit in order to escape from a witch that has captured You and put you inside a labyrinth. By using little orbs that turn into various sports balls, you fight your way through. *Game Tip* Since there is no way to skip through the game intro, Just use the password 000 to bypass it!"
1,Don't buy Lexmark,Stay away from Lexmark. They will suck you fry on printer ink. The ink cartridges have chips installed which allows a counter to check reuse preventing refills. The driver software also loads spyware type programs relaying cartridge info. All this crap just to make sure you buy all new cartridges from Lexmark. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Nice Doorstop,"This is a fine example of technology that never should have been introduced to the marketplace.My wife bought this for me at Valentine's day, and here it is not even Mother's Day, and the machine does everything but print. Which for a printer is a problem.Tech Support tells me the printer is the issue. No kidding!Save your money and buy something else."
2,This Kindle edition is incorrectly formatted,"Trollope is a great, underrated writer. But the type in this book is centered, rather than left-justified, which I found distracting enough to make it unreadable. I'll go spend a couple of bucks on a professionally formatted edition, instead."
5,How to influence without authority,"What fun to revisit these wonderful characters after so many years. Honesty, doing one's homework, courage all enables the ""thief"" and his family to live happily ever after!"
1,A dissapointing toy,"My son received the spiderman 2 wireless video camera as a birthday gift and he was very excited. We followed the directions carefully and were very dissapointed to find out that we had a defective camera. It would not transmit to the tv. After exchanging the camera, we were lulled into a false sense of excitement as the second one did not work either. Undaunted, we called the 1-800 number listed on the package. Although very friendly, they were unable to help or diagnose the problem. Very frustrating. This is a very expensive toy and the frustration we felt was huge. I would not recommend this toy. In fact we returned it took the money and bought something more fun. I hope others have had better luck than we did."
1,A huge mistake,"My seven year old son saved the $99.00 for months in order to buy this toy himself and was so excited when it came. He was extremely sad and disappointed when it didn't work. The instructions were very difficult to follow and made you think that if you just put new batteries in it, that it would magically work as well as they claimed. That just wasn't the case for us. Thankfully the return process was easy and we were able to purchase another toy."
1,So like the other review warnings! I give it a 0 for not working!,"I bought this item, for Christmas, for my parents to give to my son. Later I read some reviews on the internet. I asked my parents to try it out because of the bad ratings. Sure enough, my parents had the same trouble as most. When my parents called the company, the company did not even try to talk my parents through troubleshooting, they just said "" you can get your money back"", I feel(my opinion) that they know this is a defective product due to the fact that they were unwilling to even try to help figure out the problem. The company should recall all of these items and save the public the hastle. I can just imagine the poor parents and children over christmas. This item has been reduced to $50 from $100. They should be paying us!!!! I am turning their name to the Better Business Burea. I would suggest you do the same."
5,discription inaccurate,"This gun does not use the 2"" glue sticks; it uses the 5/8"" X 8"" sticks. The thing that makes this gun an industry standard is the high temperature of the dispensed glue. * DO NOT USE ON ANTHING HEAT SENSITIVE (like fingers!)"
1,Died after an hour,This battery died after an hour and will not charge. I won't be ordering from amazon anymore.
5,Wonderful,A wonderful tape. I am enjoying it very much. If you like Shirley Caesar this one should be in your collection.
5,Great CD,"This Cd minister to your heart, mind and soul in more ways than one of what you need it to do. I hate that I waited this long to purchase it but it still a wonderful Cd. My favorites are next in line for a miracle is a favorite. I don't think that you will regret purchasing this cd because better late than never. God had to place the song in my spirit in a dream before I purchase the cd it relaxing and very peaceful in so many ways."
4,A Malian voice,"I first heard on the album that Taj Mahal made with the great kora master, Toumani Diabate on the track entitled *Queen Bee*"
3,Varies,Pianist with remarkable chops. Sometimes as in St. Thomas he can really hold your interest. Other times can get bogged down in very intricate introspective tunes that seem to be more virtuosity than emotion.
1,Stock Up on Model Glue,"Once put together, this toy is a great looking pirate ship. Just don't try playing with it. The Lego pieces do not stick firmly together, so even the slightest touch results in the entire ship falling apart. After several frustrating attempts to play with the toy, my five year old gave up on it. We finally used model glue to glue the Legos together so that it wasn't a complete waste of money. If you don't have the time or patience to do the same, this toy isn't for you."
3,I beg to differ,"You won't get the healing power of Blake from this book because there is no free lunch. Blake is among my very favorite poets and thinkers. He is sublime. I have read all his shorter writing and dipped into the prophetic books. A huge help was that wonderful book on Blake by Northrop Frye ""Fearful Symmetry."" Another big help was the Blake Dictionary. So if you want to feel the power of Blake's thought you have to read the works themselves, not snippets from the works. You have to take Blake whole not in fragments. Also, Diamond decided to put Blake's sentences across vertically (you have to turn the page 90 degrees to read the text). This way he did not need to break up the sentences into two lines. Is this an asset? I doubt it. Still, any publicity for Blake is good for he truly gave us the golden string leading us to enlightenment."
5,Great Keyboard,"The Natural Keyboard is a great if not the best egronomic keyboard out there. Its easy to use and get used to and once you get used to egronomic keyboards, regular keyboards are terrible to use. There are 19 completely programmable hotkeys, including 7 internet, 1 mail, 8 media and hotkeys for My COmputer, Calculator and Sleep. The Hotkeys are very easy to get used to and are fairly easy to set-up. As said before they are completely customizable so any hotkey will open up an program you wish."
4,It's Only Natural,"I am typing this review on our new Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro. Unpacking and set-up was simple: shut off the computer, plug in the keyboard, turn on the computer, and load the software. Everything went as it was supposed to during set-up. The feel of the keyboard is very different from our old flat keyboard; the hands do end up in a much more natural position. All the hot keys work as promised and having a 'mute' key on the keyboard is a very nice feature. We have the model with the two USB ports in the back of the keyboard; we haven't taken advantage of this feature yet, but it expanded my one empty USB port into two. It is bigger and takes up more space than our older keyboard. I have found it hard to position the keyboard on the desk in a natural position and keep the mouse in a reachable position. Things will need to be rearranged. The Natural Keyboard Pro isn't a perfect keyboard, but so far it's way better than our old keyboard."
3,A bit more than I needed,"After using this keyboard for several months, I have concluded that while it works pretty much as promised, sometimes a company can take an uncomplicated product like a keyboard and goose it up so much that it becomes too complicated for its purpose. That is the case with this product. My keyboard rests in a drawer and the buttons at the top of the b61-00002 keyboard sometimes hit the top of the drawer starting my email program etc. Plus, I could never get the 2 USB ports to work properly. Finally, I don't type any faster on the ""natural"" keyboard and when friends and relatives use it, they complain bitterly. I should have stuck with a simple keyboard with all of these bells and whistles. My mistake. Not Microsoft's. But think about this before you buy this product."
5,Best keyboard ever made,"The title sums it up. This is the best, and most comfortable keyboard I have ever used. I am a very fast touch typist, with a very heavy touch since I learned on mechanical typewriters (remember those? Not even an electrical assist.). This keyboard lets me go faster, gives me far, far less fatigue and repetitive stress pain than any other, and ought to be the standard.As I said, I bang the keys pretty hard. The Natural Keyboard Pro just keeps on working happily; mine is at least 5 years old and going strong. Normally I bash an IBM or Dell (or any other) keyboard into destruction within a year."
3,*NOT* recommended for fast typers,"The keyboard is adequate. I like the feel of it and the positioning of the hands. However, I have one rather large complaint to make: When typing certain words, namely those that end in ""nce,"" the letter u mysteriously appears at the end of it. I have tested my theory with numerous words, and they all seem to end with a u, even though it wasn't typed. This appears to happen when I'm typing at a fast pace. I am going to see if this is just a defect and see if I can get another one. Otherwise, just a mixed positive/negative review."
2,I don't understand the high rating for this keyboard,"I got my employer to buy this keyboard thinking it would be as good as the one I got at home, the original Microsoft Natural. Well, I am a bit disappointed. Yes the correct layout is back. But some keys catch... they don't get down easely as I press on them, particularly the larger ones. I don't know if that was a problem with the keyboard I got, but the feeling is definitly better with the original. It seems like cheap manufacturing to me."
5,Best Keyboard...By Far,I bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago and I have no regrets. The hot keys are great for internet surfing and for listening to media files such as Winamp. I also plugged my Intellimouse Optical into the USB ports in the back and did not have to use a valuable USB port in the back of my machine. I would suggest this keyboard to anyone who likes the ergonomic feel and who spends a lot of time on the internet and listening to or watching media.
3,Problem with Shift+B,"This keyboard has a firm, high quality key touch, which was very satisfying, but I think it can be difficult to get used to because it forces you to always type letters with either hand.For example, because I don't use the right shift key, when I type the big letter ""B"" with shift, I have always used my right hand. Now I have trouble each time I have to type the capital B. They should have put B in the right half of the board also.Still, Everytime I try my old keyboard I can see how unnatural my hand must have uncontiously been. This keyboard needs practice, but there is no doubt it is good for your wrist."
1,What a waste of resources,De Niro is apparently a brain-damaged monster in one scene and then an articulate philosopher in the next. I saw this film the week that it was released. People were laughing at scenes that were'nt supposed to be funny. The film was inadvertently a runner-up to Young Frankenstein in the comedy genre.
5,DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS,"AS MOVIE FANS KNOW MOST OF THE TIME THE ""PROFESSIONAL CRITICS"" DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.THIS VERSION OF THE CLASSIC IS THE BEST AND MOST ENTERTAINING YET."
3,Could have been better...,"This is a fairly good attempt at re-creating a timeless horror classic. Branagh did well and his version is quite mature if what a little boring. After viewing it once I don't think its a film that I could be bothered to watch again, instead it's covered in dust on my video shelf. As a horror fan, I can't denie that this is still good with a good host of British actors. Robert De Niro was pretty good as the monster but the make up of the monster did not have much to offer, horror wise, but then like I said, this is a film for mature horror fans."
2,"really, really, really bad","First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face."
1,0 STARS: Booooooooooring!!!,"I simply thought this ""Frankenstein"" movie was boring. Robert DeNiro is a great actor, but this movie failed to keep my interest. I would not recommend this flick to horror movie fans."
4,Did Mary Shelley make you fear or sympathis the creature?,"For my coursework i need to answer the follwoing question "" Do you think Mary Shelley makes the reader fear or sympathise with the creature created?""If you wouldn't mind could you send me your opinions of this, it would help me greatly.Thank yourox_angel"
5,BEAUTIFUL!,"It came brand new with the wrapping still on and the movie was so beautiful and so flawless.. just loved it! <3!GREAT PRODUCT, CAME BEFORE DELIVERY DATE AND OVERALL 5 STARS!"
4,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein on Blu Ray,"I saw Mary Shelley's Frankenstein when first released on Video than again on standard DVD & now again on Blu Ray with a clearer picture and sound with a great cast & performance by Robert Deniro & Kenneth Branagh a young DR who creates a creature from bodys of convicts and the brain of a brilliant scientist who later on realizes will never be accepted by man so takes revenge on DR Frankenstein and Family , Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a Good Show and not a bad Blu Ray copy with a good picture and not bad sound but lacks volume & base in some scenes as the sound tends to fade away and the same goes for the DVD so is not quite as good as some of the other Blu Rays out there but still better than Video and DVD 4/5 ."
1,a grevious error,This movie was wildly disappointing to anyone who has actually READ THE BOOK. The screenplay authors have apparently added things just for hollywood's sake. It's terrible. The whole part about Frankenstein making a girlfriend for the monster is completely fabricated. It never occured in Shelley's book. ...
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring!!!!",This is quite simply the most boring movie I have ever seen. The actors (all pretty good) struggle with a tedious script and a banal storyline. Bring back Boris Karlof........please!!!
3,It's okay.,"Huge monster movie fan, this was basically no different from any other Frankenstein film. Deniro is good but is barely in the piece, pretty lame all in all."
1,Not at all like Mary Shelley's novel.,"Do not be taken in by the statement on the cover - ""true to the original."" This is a poor action film with none of the sentiment of the book."
5,wonderful...,"I saw this again for the third time last week, and it still hasn't lost any of its charm. I'm glad to see a movie that actually remains faithful to the book. As a fellow reviewer wrote, ""Frankenstein"" is a tragedy, not a horror novel/movie. Though it can go a bit over the top at times, the performances by Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter are exquisite, and De Niro's monster is suprisingly moving. Especially if you are a fan of the book, or of superb acting, don't miss this movie."
3,Good movie for the 90s,"I remember this movie being better than what it was the first time i saw it years ago. one of my favorite versions of frankenstein though, i love helena bonham carter. Music is kind of good. it arrived in a timely fashion too."
2,Not like the book!,It was alright but it was not the best because it was said to resemble the book but it really did not do justice to the book. So I kept this one short and I hope that you like it but I really did not.
2,"Largely boring. Ms. Shelley would not approve, I think.","This film, like Coppola's Dracula epic, proves that even brilliant filmmakers can't seem to avoid the tempation to 'improve' upon the original classics...though both are closer to the originals than most other film versions, and both contain the occasional riveting scene...Read the books."
4,"Not an authentic adaptation of the book, but still fun.","""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" is an incredibly melodramatic adaptation of the book that takes huge liberties with the plot, but I still find it thoroughly entertaining. The movie is perfectly cast, and I think that the embellishments that Kenneth Branagh takes with the story only make the film more enjoyable. Even though I doubt that Dr. Frankenstein ran around without a shirt on as much as Branagh does in the film, most women will probably find it quite enjoyable. Robert DeNiro is amaing in his role of ""the creature,"" and Helena Bonham Carter gives a great performance as Elizabeth. If you're the type of person who detests it when filmmakers stray too far from the text of the book they're adapting, then this film probably isn't for you. If you're a bit more open-minded and are just looking for an entertaining movie to watch, this is a perfect film to add to your collection."
3,I love everything about this movie--except the Creature.,"I mean, really! Short little Robert de Niro as the Creature? What was Kenneth Branagh thinking? Everything else is fine. True, Frankenstein's attempt to resurrect Elizabeth wasn't in the book, but it rings true with the character. It's exactly what he would do! If only Branagh had cast somebody more physically imposing as the Creature, this could have been a classic."
3,Frank. represents,"While the film itself is a testament to the science fiction novel, the film does not stick to the text, which is why many of my students were confused when we watched it. I love Kenneth Branagh, but I think he should have stuck to the text, like he usually does with his Shakespeare works. Visually the film was stunning, but I wish he would have stayed with the novel."
5,this gets crapped on too much,"not everybody likes the book, which i can understand (it took me some effort to get into), but if you're a fan of shelley's frankenstein i dont see what's to hate about this movie. personally i like it a lot."
4,The closest yet,"This movie is the closest adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel I have seen yet. To my knowledge this shows the creature as it was, not some big green monster with bolts in his neck. The creatue is intelligent, has feelings (DeNiro does a great job with this character) and wants to be accepted. A great cast fills out rest of the movie."
3,This is a newer version of the classic.,"I was really wanting a classic version of Mary Shelley's book to show in my classroom. Thank goodness I previewed it, because there is an inappropriate scene in this movie I will have to edit."
3,Branagh's Frankenstein,"After almost twenty I decided to give this movie a second chance. And, to be honest, it has some good stuff on it. The acting is really good. De Niro is superb, maybe one of his best performances. In the soul of his creature is possible to see all the human greatness and tragedy. Helena Bonham Carter, Tom Hulce e Kenneth Branagh deserve to be credited too. They make a great work here. Even Branagh gives to his Frankenstein a sense of humanity that's worth note. Bonham Carter, also, has some amazing moments. The screenplay is fine, as well. Some good dialogues and one to be remembered: the talking between the creature and Frankenstein in the ice cave.Certainly, there are some flaws: Branagh's conduction is exaggerated. The birth of the creature is almost comical and the pace of scenes is too accelerated. Besides, the soundtrack is really bad and doesn't help anyway.I'd love to give three stars and half, but as it is not possible it's a three star movie."
2,Definetly not Mary Shelly's.,"If this were another typical Frankenstein movie it would have been the best. However, in the title, it claims to be Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, implying that it was based off the book. I have just finished reading the book by Mary Shelly, and the movie itself is missing so many important details that it distorts the book completely. In the movie, The introdction of characters is wrong, the creation of the monster is wrong, EVERYTHING IS WRONG! This is in no way Mary Shelly's. Now, I'm not knocking the movie at all. It was a rather ok movie. But if you're expecting it to be like Mary Shelly's book, then you will be greatly disappointed, much as I was. If you want to see an accurate Frankenstein movie that is stricly based off the book, then I suggest tuning into the Disney Channel. Mickey always seems to get things right!"
5,A great classic film!,"I watched Frankenstein a few years ago when i was much younger and didn't watch all of it so i didn't really understand it all yet i still really liked it. I think this really reflects to the book writen by Mary Shelly as its hard to make it exactly right. I think Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter and Robert De Niro were all excellent in this film and Helena Bomham Carter is my favourite actress i have seen her in many films. Although like another review said i did find this quite sad along with its horror but thats the whole point i suppose, thats the reason it makes it good. I would recommend this to teenagers and above so you can understand the whole film and enjoy. Of course overall I really enjoyed this film it is a good horror which is sad and a good love story and i'm sure many others who haven't seen it yet will enjoy it to."
1,Branagh's Frankenstein,"Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book. His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable. He ruined it. Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable. The end of Justine is pointless. Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster. Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme. Frankly, disgusted. Kenneth, what are you doing?"
2,Awful film. Ridiculous script. Skip it.,"Kenneth Branagh's take on MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN, while faithful to the novel and featuring Robert De Niro in an interesting take upon The Creature, is still incredibly silly. It's an overdone, melodramatic, silly mess of a film.I recall, in particular, the scene where his character and his ""sister"" played by Helena Bonham Carter admit their love for one another. Carter looks at him and says, ""Brother ...,"" and he replies, ""Sister ...,"" and then together they say, ""Lover!"" I laughed out loud in the middle of the theater because it was ridiculously handled and delivered in such a campy manner.The Creature, played by De Niro, is more human in this adaptation and thus more sympathetic. But, of course, the ridiculous screenplay gives him some really ridiculous lines. His Creature does read and write, proving to be quite an effective, even mature, villain.But I don't like this Frankenstein or this Frankenstein's monster. I don't like them at all."
1,"poor, very poor","Whoever wrote that this movie is relatively faithful to the novel is COMPLETELY wrong. There are MANY changes made for the worse...Mary Shelley wrote what she did for a reason, folks!! THis is a bad movie in and of itself, even without the lack of faith to the excellent novel. Just read the book. If you are a good reader, the movie will do nothing but distract you from a great novel."
4,Best Scene:,"When the monster is chased off by the young man, after trying to befriend the family he's watched and learned from for about a year, he goes off and cries, it is one of deNiro's best scenes ever, and it adds so much to the monster, its sick and pathetic to the fullest, and confusing.Overall, its a little gory to the point of sillyness, and gets ridiculous with the killing and bringing back to life of Frankenstein's girl, and then the re-killing of her, and all that other stuff that was not from the novel.Brannagh's Frankenstein is pretty good, a little too jolly during the jolly times, though that's importnat. Overall, pretty good."
2,Disgustingly over the top,"It's appalling how over-acted this film is. Everything from the death of the mother, to the kites in the stormy field to everything else that follows, is just hideously over-done in every way possible. A wasted budget, a waste of an amazing performance by De Niro, a waste of time, really.2 and a half stars for De Niro and some quite vivid cinematography."
4,"Very Intense! Well done, Mr. Branagh!","Kenneth Branagh takes no prisoners in this very intense and moving interpretation of the Frankenstein story. This is not a film for the faint of heart and is not a traditional horror movie. Robert Deniro's performance as the monster is brilliant. True to Mery Shelley's original concept, Director Branagh and Deniro have created a truly tragic creature here that's only a monster on the surface. Underneath, there's a thinking, feeling being who just wants to be accepted and loved. He makes every attempt to find his place among humanity, including offering to disappear forever if only his creator will build him a female companion. When all the creature's attempts and pleas are scorned, he vows revenge on the one who created him and doomed him to such a miserable existence. Many viewers will find this movie too gory and sad, but I thoroughly enjoyed the intensity of Branagh's direction. This is a movie everyone should at least once. Well done Mr. Branagh"
5,good album,"Janis is the greatest female singer of all time, no doubt about it. And her early acid rock with Big Brother doesn't deny that fact. The best song on here is Call On Me, a duet between Janis and...uh, Sam I think. But the album is a nice mix of folk, blues and acid rock. If you like Janis, or sixties music, add this to your collection."
4,Finally available and well worth the wait!,"Many fans of Janis and the band Big Brother and the Holding Company find this album completely ridiculous when compared to their later work. But you know what? This album is excellent! The songs are usually very short (none exceed 3 minutes), but it's all fun listening, even the childlike ""Caterpillar"". All the songs have a certain something about them, a mix of folk rock, country, and rock and roll. The album reminds me of JEFFERSON AIRPLANE TAKES OFF: it's an excellent early beginning to an excellent band!"
2,Not one of the better phonic reading products,Not one of the better phonic reading products. Not bad at all. Just surpassed by others.
4,Joe Vitale's Proudest Moment,"This guy was Joe Walsh's right hand man. He had a lot of input on Walsh's albums, as he heavily influenced the music and overall sound of Walsh's 70's albums. He's also the one who played the wonderful flute parts on The Smoker You Drink. My point is: This guy was very talented and capable of standing on his own, and this is a very good CD. I bought it based on some of the previous reviews here, and I'm glad I did."
4,roller coaster weekend joe vitale,"First off, I am so pleased to have found this recording available on CD! I was lucky enough to have seen Vitale's Madmen tour in support of this album. The sound on this CD is very good concidering the fact that no remastering was done.Stil a must-have for anyone who even thinks that the old guys can't rock with today's bands. Thank you Amazon for making it possible for me to find this treasue!! New music is cool, but, WHAT AN ALBUM!!! Thanks"
2,I CAN'T GET IT,"I can't follow it. Maybe the onyl explanation lays in contractual issues. WHy am I telling this ? Because DEMON recorded two great metal albuns, two real five-stars: They are their first two releases. The rest, forgive me, is below average. And we have only six songs from those great albuns in this compilation, what alone is reason enough to discredit totally this compitation. Sad."
5,Excellent Book,"I read this book a couple of times when I was a teenager (I'm 23 now) and I loved it. When I found a copy of it on here, I was quick to buy it. This is a great book, and a quick, suspenseful read. I think this now, even though I'm no longer a teen. Get this book, you won't be disappointed."
3,"A classic, but outdated and poor methodology used.","If you are interested in classic sociological theory, you must read Durkheim...but always with the understanding that we have come a long way since 1912. The fundamental assumption upon which Durkheim's work is based, that aboriginal practices are religion at its most basic and primitive, is no longer accepted as necessarily true. And it definitely cannot be assumed that practices that can be observed today mirror practices from centuries ago, as it is the nature of social practices to adopt with fluidity to changing times and cultures. It is important to recognize Durkheim's role in beginning the dialogue, but it is also important to see the flaws in his work."
2,Abridged... why?,"I, too am disappointed that the new edition is abridged. One reviewer noted that only about 30 pages were taken out, but for serious readers, students, and teachers, it is important to have the book exactly as Durkheim wrote it. I am a professor of sociology and I suppose this edition would be OK for teaching (the introduction is fantastic), but for my own scholarship, I could not depend on itbecause I am unsure what has been excised and the rationale. This is not just the idle complaint of a pedant - this is one of the most important books in the history of modern social thought and there is no excuse for abridging it, especially when the cover DOES NOT note that it is abridged. In a classic, every word counts."
2,This is very early Benn Hill in B&W.,"Frankly I was dissapointed.I did not realise this was a B&W set of videos from early TV shows. The pictures were grainy, and the comedy was very tame. No bawdy sketches, no T&A like the shows seen on American TV. Unless you are a conosseur, forget it. Also the Good, Bawd and Benny tape sold separately is part of this collection-ask me how I know!"
2,benny hill ho ho,"Firstly hi, then id say im from the town where benny is burried ,so Im almost biassed but hey ive seen most of his stuff. For years I never thought it was that funny but looking back now from my lofty 26 years I can honestly say they all amuse me ,if you can look at his comedie without any expectations then im sure you will laugh as much as I have.Thanks"
2,Eyes Bigger than Stomachs,"While I applaud the author's stated intention of injecting personal insight and empathy into a discipline that has long been characterized by often falsely objective posturing, this collection left me highly dissatisfied. The effect of her essays was to make anthropology just another of the many contemporary genres that inflate ""personal experience,"" rendering it melodramatic and marketable. If I were more interested in the individual doing the telling, perhaps the book would be more compelling, and I found myself reading on in the hope that at some point the author would succeed in making herself an interesting subject. Unfortunately, the finale left me with the suspicion that she is not a particularly good writer, though she may be a very good academic, one who sells books to boot."
5,One of the best,"Paul Rodgers and Bad Company make for some of the best music in the industry. The Law, even though it may have been a one time release is some of the best music I have heard from Paul Rodgers.Not to cut any thing else that he has done in the past, because I love it all, this CD has got to be my favorite. 5 stars is my Vote. :)"
3,Is this a band?,"I'll start by saying that I'm a big fan of Paul Rodgers' vocals. For that alone I'll give this 3 stars, that and the song ""Stone"". It was written by Chris Rea, and includes his guitar playing as well as David Gilmour's. It is easily the best song on this album. ""Laying Down the Law"" is also good, sounding like a Bad Company tune with Paul on piano. My third favorite song is ""Miss You in a Heartbeat"", written by Phil Collen of Def Leppard (and later released by them as well), a song that Paul carries well. My only question is why was this a band? Three of the songs were written by Rodgers, he sang all the lead vocals, and more than a dozen guest artists performed or wrote the other songs. As far as I can tell Jones played drums and nothing more, so why was this a two person band? My point is that it is clearly a Paul Rodgers solo project and should have been labeled as such. Nevertheless, if you like Paul's music, go ahead and get this for the reasons that I stated above."
1,Guilty As Charged,"Kenny Jones left his gig with The Who for what was to be yet another supergroup, teaming up with Paul Rodgers of Free & Bad Company fame, as The Law.Guest appearances by David Gilmour and Bryan Adams could not save The Law from being shot down by critics and fans in 1991. The album was a budget-breaker in production, pushed heavily for FM radio play, but never was able to crawl out from the bottom of the charts.After the cut, Laying Down The Law, it is nothing more than rehashed posturing from a pair of rock legends who should know better."
5,Pacino is a genius,al pacino is truly a legend and this book is a must for anyone even remotely a fan of his work . A Must read .
4,Hearing early Buddy Guy was great!,"I had just read the autobiography of Buddy Guy and he had mentioned this recording in his book. So I decided to give it a listen. I was not disappointed. A lot of the music was Junior Wells on the harmonica, but, you can hear the "" Buddy Guy licks"" in the background. Great recording!"
4,True Blues,"A very enjoyable collection of classic blues by one of the original masters. A must have, if you love classic blues."
5,A Definite Desert Island CD....,"Junior Wells could easily be mistaken for a reincarnation of James Brown with his opening song ""Snatch It Back And Hold It"" but the energy does not stop there....it is found on nearly every song on this CD. Other songs on the CD have a more ""traditional"" blues feeling such as ""In The Wee Hours"", a slow grinding blues song, which makes you just sit back and appreciate life. ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" is one of the best versions of the song I have ever heard......Wells brings an effusive style to his music, an unrelenting energy rarely found. What is most impressive is that this was Junior Well's first recording, after playing for many years in other bands, the most notable among them being Muddy Waters' band. Junior Well's energy and fantastic harp playing, along with Buddy Guy's superb guitar playing, make this easily one of my all-time favorite blues CD's."
2,Over-rated,"Why does this secure such glowing reviews? Yes, it's okay but not much more. Buddy Guy is rock solid here rather than inspired and the suggestion in the sleeve-notes that Wells is an outstanding singer is well wide of the mark. Ordinary. He was by all accounts an outstanding drunk, but that's another matter."
5,This Top Tier Chicago Blues Album is Better than great!,"If you are a fan of 60s Chicago blues, then you know already that Hoodoo Man Blues securely occupies a place in the canon of Chicago Blues recordings. Hot, direct, and impossible to dismiss, it set a standard that few recordings of any genre can meet. If you are beginning to explore the blues, this CD is an excellent place to start."
5,Junior Wells at his best,"I think this product is a ""must have"" in anyone's blues collection. Having listened to this type of music for over 40 years, I can say that this CD shows the versatility of Junior Wells and you will never get tired of listening to it."
4,Some times more is not better,"The original album is great. What wonderful energy the band puts out. I don't think that the extra tracks and studio chatter really enhance the original. Only one or two cuts were of the same caliber; it may have been better to combine with another Junior Wells or Buddy Guy album of that period. Probably not doable due to copyright issues. Still with this great music, it is a real treat."
5,This book is awesome!,"I owned a copy years ago when it first came out.. Finally found it again. This boos is far better than finding tabs on the internet, It isn't as easy but far more accurate!"
5,Well Written,The Beatles Fake book's melodies are well written and have accurate chords. There are over 100 songs in the book! Buying the Beatles Fake book is a good investment.
5,Fabulous book,"Great guitar tabs, comprehensive, and lays flat due to spriral binding. Bought one for ourselves and one as a gift...both are now treasured volumes."
5,"Excellent resource, though not precisely as descr","This songbook is an excellent resource for anyone looking to play their favorite beatles tunes. It is easy to read, and the chords and melodies have so far been very accurate and reliable.However, the ""Sample Music Notation"" displayed to show what the music will look like is not accurate. The Sample is written in a bubbly and handwritten style, similar to the traditional jazz ""Real Book."" In fact, this book is presented in common print form, with the name of the chords above a guitar chord diagram (guitarists being just that dumb apparently, as opposed to the other C instruments this book is advertised to). Below the chord symbols is the staff with the melody written in Treble clef, and the lyrics below.If that is what you're looking for then look no further."
4,All of the Early Beatles,"An excellent selection of just about all of the early Beatles & a few in between. I do wish the writing was just a little larger, but all in all I am satisfied. The spiral binding is another plus."
2,Bad cover,"The wife complained that she didn't think that the condition would be as bad as it was. But we will expect it, this is the problem when you buy something that is sight unseen."
5,"hey, it's a FAKE book","This is far more accurate than any other fake book. And unlike most of them, every key matches the recording.Of course you don't get all the details. If that's what you want, Wolf Marshall's guitar books are the best.If you like turning pages in the middle of each verse and then turning back to 'del signo' you'll be reall happy with the complete scores.But if you want the whole song on one page, this is the ticket. Someone put some hard work into this little sucker.I use a fine point pen to copy the harmonies from the scores.Sometimes I even write the bass line in using an alternate color.Works for me.I like getting thru entire songs without stopping to turn pages."
4,Buy it if you love the Beatles.,"The book has 200 songs, there are chord diagrams, and the vocal notes seem pretty accurate. Each and every song is on one page or on two adjacent pages so that NO page turning is need for any song. This apparent blessing may also be a curse for those who don't have Eagle eyes, since the cleff is very, very small. Has almost any song you would want to play, Elinor Rigbie is the only notable song that I found missing. [its] is a little pricey, but any authentic beatles fan who's a musician should buy this book."
2,Fake indeed,"I bought this book in 1991 when I first bought a guitar, and it helped me learn how to do simple chord changes and figure out the basics of playing guitar. But a lot of the songs are just plain wrong. They don't really sound like the famous versions, and as a result they can be more frustrating than anything else. You're much better off with the Beatles Complete Scores book, which gets all the songs right."
2,Warning - tiny type!,"I already own Complete Scores and a 1987 ""Beatles Complete"", but I bought this so I would have something to use in performance, to cue me on lyrics and music without any page turns. Surprise: the arrangements are in such tiny print that it's virtually impossible to use this in performance as a fake book. You just can't read the words unless your face is only a few inches from the book, with perfect lighting. I would gladly have paid more if they'd laid out each song on 2 facing pages, but instead they usually cram 3 songs on those 2 facing pages. Compare this to the Real Book, which is thicker because it is typeset so you can actually use it in performance as a fake book.The Beatles music? 5 stars, of course. The arrangements here? Good enough, the ones I've bothered to hunch over and read; 4 stars. The layout and usefulness of this book for its advertised purpose? 1 star."
5,A superb resource and musical education!,"This is an excellent book! The purpose of a 'fake book' is not to provide note-for-note transcriptions, but to show the chords, melody, and lyrics so you can play your own arrangement. I play guitar, and with this book I can easily sit around all day and play and sing these wonderful songs to my heart's content. Very fun, and a great way to learn! It really helps that all songs are on one or two facing pages, so no page-turning is involved.These charts are very accurate, contrary to another comment below. I'm on my second copy of this book in seven years (it does tend to fall apart after a while) and have been very happy with the accuracy of the chords, unlike some other books I've seen.If you want to play note-for-note riffs and leads, then get the The Complete Scores, but if you just want to play and sing the songs, this book can't be beat!"
5,And Your Bird Can Sing,This book is a music teacher's wish come true and a music student's answered prayer. It contains Beatle songs from obscure to well-known classic staples and will no doubt delight fans of all degrees.The chords work for the recordings; the diagrams are accurate and the songs can be played by students at the intermediate level. Beatle songs are a staple of life; performers of all genres have included Beatle songs in their repertoires; the Beatles are a part of culture that will remain timeless and immutable. We need this book!
2,this system suks,"for a christmas present from my mother i got a home theatre system that i was bugging her to get me due to the price. well the price u pay, u get less for that price. after awhile the two front speekers were the only speekers that would work. i thought i blew the channels but the unit is crappy. DONT BUY IT!"
5,Better Late Than Never,"While I have had several albums by Chick Corea for over 30 years starting with ""Return to Forever"", I never heard about this album until Pat Metheny mentioned it in an interview. Remarkably this album was issued the same year as ""Return to Forever"" (1972) which may be why it never made it to the surface for many of us.This is a transcendent piece of music. There are many levels of melody created by enormous virtuosity of two musicians feeding off each other in an amazing interplay. The sound is excellent and the recording has plainly been remastered by someone who really knew that they were doing. Played in a dark room with good headphones it takes you places that you want to return to regularly. How I missed it all of these years I don't know but thank you Pat Metheny."
5,"Perfect, and perfectly cute!","I gave this to my two year old for Christmas and she loves it. In fact my three year old son wanted one, too! The desk is a little big for my daughter, but usable and has room to grow. I think she will get a couple years of use at least. The desk was easy to put together and came with all pieces and the tool to use, as well (allen wrench). It took about 30 mins to assemble (at 11:00 on Christmas eve). The desk is the perfect size for a child's bedroom or possibly the corner of a kitchen."
3,adjustable chair,I purchased the leftie for my nephew since my son has the rightie.The leftie has a way smaller desk than the rightie which makes it a bit harder since there isnt enough space for the child to rest his hand and book.I think you need to increase the size of the desk to same as the rightie.
5,Never be better,"Without doubt, he was one of the genius musicians in the world. His ability as a member of X-Japan and leader of SpreadBeaver shows everything. We cannot see him anymore, but his music and voice will remain forever."
2,Locks up Windows-98,"I am considering returning the product, if I can find another product that works better. The tool had locked up several times, forcing me to hit the power switch to reboot. The menu system doesn't give you the ability to tell the user that they selected an invalid option and to try again. The custom greatings are easy to do, but you can't reuse them. A greeting you record for one mailbox is not selectable for another mailbox. Also, I would rate the on-line help as so-so, and Symantec's web knowledgebase as worst than most."
1,No attention to the details...,"I've had Talk WorksPro 3.0 for a while now - even downloaded updates and info from the Symantec web site. But there are too many problems with this software. If you use TAPI (so you can use the modem from other apps), caller ID doesn't work. If you use the COM port directly, other apps can't use the modem. Too many people who call me get detected as ""silent"" and talkworks hangs up on them. Configuring the program is just difficult and time consuming - so many settigs to change yet can't get it to work properly. Talk works isn't the way to unify voice/fax and email..."
1,It does lock up Windows 98,"Launch it and it just won't work under Win 98. The whole computer freezes, forcing a hard reboot. Symantec makes no effort to help. Does work on my Win 95 machine, but I still highly suggest DO NOT BUY!"
1,No Longer Supported by Symantec,"This was a good product but Symantec no longer produces or supports it. It no longer works on my Pentium computer and it won't reinstall unless I reformat my hard drive. No, I won't do that. Lorraine (David's Wife) :-("
1,Too good to be true,"I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better. I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly. Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item. I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box. Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed. Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future."
2,Silly -- And I fell for it,"I wish I had kept the box!This arrived as a gift off our registry. I attached it to a box of wipes two days ago and plugged it in. My goodness! It bakes the top piece of the wipe that is sticking out of the pull-slot, but the rest of it is cool.Plus, the adhesive on the gizmo doesn't really stick. How would this be good for travel? You'd have to keep your original wipes box for all the years you have babies!Lastly, the fire hazard thing freaks me out. It's probably not a huge deal, but I feel like I am leaving an iron on a stack of tissues. Just my paranoia, maybe.I like the warm wipes idea because I don't think my child is going to be the type to tolerate a cold wipe on her bottom. (Her Mama isn't that type!) But someone needs to invent a wipes case that is battery operated and durable."
1,Not very good at all...,"Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold. Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer."
5,Enlightenment in a Book,"The SILVA METHOD contained in this book is helping me to gain confidence in my own ability to succeed, though the power of positive thought. The easy to follow exercises immediately produce results. I'm certain all people will have the same results, but I am confident that you will not regret the purchase of this helpful and enjoyable book."
1,Spiritual Kitsch,"Go ahead and buy it if you must. Everyone should read a Silva book once in their lives. Do you pick up the supermarket tabloids now and then to laugh at their audaciousness and wonder exactly what sort of people actually take them seriously? If so, I know you'll enjoy this book."
3,Brilliant but only marginally interesting,"This is an example of Barth in his ""too smart for us readers"" mode. Instead of telling a poignant and interesting and perhaps moving story about a complicated family wrapped up in cold-war intrigue and general late-twentieth century angst and insanity, this is a book about books, and about writing. If you go in for that sort of thing you will love it. Far from being straightforward, the plotting is circuitous and completely unsatisfying; the shifting point of view is so consciously experimental that it is almost a joke on the reader. There is no doubt that John Barth is a lot smarter than most of us, and is a really brilliant writer and thinker. But his brilliance keeps this from being a fun or entertaining novel. If you like your reading experimental and self-conscious, by all means, pick it up!"
1,Worst product ever!,"A week after buying this product, the leather came loose!Very disappointed! Never experienced this with Kenneth Cole products. I hope I get a discount for this!"
3,I've had better,"Comparing this to AX, I think AX edges slightly (similar style) but AX's price is too high. So, if you are looking for a belt withreversible feature, this is not bad."
1,Not ORIGINAL,"This nproduc is not original, it is not lether it is synthetic. Actually i have the same belt and you can tell the diference right away IT IS FAKE."
4,Nice belt,"Quality of the belt is good, thicker than what I would have expected. Easy to switch sides when needed. Hard to distinguish between black and brown side from a distance, as the brown seems to be really dark...ok for me as I primarily use the black side. For the month I've had it, it's help up to daily use, and I'm ultimately happen with the purchase. Should last a while, as I see no diminish of quality as of now."
3,"decent basic belt, may not last long","The price was right and it was reversible, but the buckle on this is the kind that doesn't last long. I've purchased this type before and it's great for infrequent use. If you can afford it, Fossil belts last much longer and just get better with age. The leather on this is thick but feels like bonded leather surfacing rather than solid leather."
1,Incorrect Size!,I ordered a size 32 and received one that is at least 5 inches short! Frustrating. Quality seems good though.
3,Kenneth Cole Men's Waldof Reversible Leather Belt,Durability is a concern. Metal end separated from leather after a couple of months use
1,The belt split into two layers after one week use. Poor quality!,The belt looks neat because of it simplicity. However the quality is awful. The belt split into two layers. I suggest not buying this belt.
1,worst belt ever,I purchased this as a gift for my dad. The durability is a concern. The buckle is broken after a few months use.
1,"After 4-5 wearings, the belt started to separate (the black side from the brown side)","After 4-5 wearings, the belt started to separate (the black side from the brown side. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY IT!"
1,two face separated,I just used it for one month but the belt start to separate. (the inner brown face and outre black face are detached)
2,Poor quality,"Fit was poor, quality was poor, will end up at Salvation Army. I expected more from K. Cole and was quite disappointed. Will not buy any other items from them,DCW."
1,This is a belt that MC Hammer would use to compliment his Hammer pants.,"I guess anything with ""Reaction"" in the item name begs just that. Maybe ok for some, but it's not my style at all."
4,It fit perfectly,"I usually wear a 32 pant, so I ordered a 34 belt. I was a bit worried because you never know what a product is like in real life. It fit perfectly as I hoped. Very good quality and good for every day use. Perfect with jeans and jacket."
5,Nice,It fits very well. Good material and seems that will lasts for a long time. The brown side is like a dark brown chocolate
4,"Good belt, well made at a good price","The product was delivered quickly and matched the description perfectly. I wear a size 30 pant and ordered a size 32 belt. I admit I was nervous that it wouldn't fit properly but was wrong, it fits great. Gave it 4 stars because I am not crazy about the style, it's a bit ordinary and I prefer a more cutting edge look . The belt is of good quality and is well made. I wear it to work, but am still seeking a more unique style. It's perfect to wear with a sport coat and jean, but falls short in a more formal attire."
4,Nice reversible leather belt.,The belt came in quickly. Pleased with the quality of the leather and the appearance of the belt. I am using for office and casual too.
5,Great belt,"This is my second one of these. I left my other one at friends house while out of town and just ordered a new one since I wanted a 36"" instead of 34"" anyway. The clip on the buckle holds well and doesn't come undone while in use. The leather is not too stiff and is a nice deep black."
2,is not practical to use reversible,"After a few wearings, the belt started to separate (the black side from the brown side) in the center of my back, Is not practical to use reversible."
1,Correa Keneth Cole,"The belt is very nice, but in the colored part of brown has marks or scratches, i.e. it is defective."
2,"Good looking, poor quality","I like how this belt looks, but the material is shoddy. I've bought two of these (hoping that the first one was a mistake), and both had the same problem. After a few months of once or twice a week wear, the leather starts to split. The seam where the black leather and the brown leather are glued together comes undone. I'm sure it could be fixed with some leather glue or something along those lines, but is that what you would expect from a Kenneth Cole belt?"
2,poor quality!,"very nice stylish belt but very bad quality it broke after two weeks of normal use,i will not recommend it."
5,excelent,I Loved it. Everything was great. I recommend this store. I didnt have any inconvenience or delays. Im going to be an usual costumer.
2,Not at all durable,"This belt came apart within about 5 days of buying it. It looked great new, but it immediately started to come apart. It isn't even stitched it's glued. I would not recommend this belt to anyone who planned to use it for more than a few days."
4,Kenneth Cole Reaction belt,This is a very stylish belt. The fact that is reversible is a plus however the only complaint I have is that the brown side is a bit too dark. A little too much like the black side. Other than that it is a great belt.
2,La correa se despega y se abre en dos,"La correa se ve muy bien, pero en menos de dos semanas de uso la correa se ha comenzado a abrir en 2, lamentablemente ya no puedo usarla más por que no se ve nada bien."
1,Broke very easily,"The seams have come apart after just a few months. not very durable, looks good but feels cheap and came apart way too easily."
1,Not Durable,The belt split into two pieces after a couple months of light use. The black side split away from the brown side.
1,Broke after two weeks,"I really liked this belt, but it broke after 2 weeks when the glue holding the fastener into the leather came undone. Sent it back for a refund, but I'm going to china and can't get a new one. Maybe that's for the best."
5,Perfect,Exactly what I wanted. A classy looking belt for a great price. The fact that its reversible is even better!!
2,Poor quality,"As several other reviewers have noted, this belt separates in the middle after a couple of months. If you must replace it once every four months, might as well buy something more expensive that lasts longer."
3,Showed up a little defective,"This is a great belt, good looking and good quality at a good price. However when it showed up, there was a tiny kink in the leather in the back. Over the course of ~3 months wearing the belt now, this kink has expanded to be a pretty noticeable gap in the back. I'm not sure if mine was just defective but just something to look for, you should probably return it immediately if you notice it."
2,Disappointed,"Now, I have become certain that Kenneth Cole Reaction belts suck. I wore it a couple of times and noticed that the belt started to show signs of worn out. The belt is reversible that means there two pieces glued together, after a couple of times wearing it the glued parts started to open up. Kenneth Cole should think about a different way in making these kind of reversible belts last longer and of a good quality. I am really disappointed and I will never buy these kind of products again."
2,Poor quality - beware,"I bought this belt 2 months ago. The belt is great at first, but after a while the two leather pieces will begin to separate and you'll end up with two fully separated leather strips. I came here to buy a second (identical) belt thinking mine was an oddity, but seeing that other customers complain too I'll look for another model."
2,Belt of low quality.,"The belt material is synthetic and the fraying ends in each use, you almost have to put with tweezers to prevent from falling apart!"
3,Not really reversible,This is a nice belt except when you reverse it you can hardly tell any difference because it's such a dark brown it looks black. On the brown sign you can also see imprints that tells you where it's made. I will just use this as a black belt.
2,Not-Satisified,The belt has a nice outlook appeal but what made it not satisfied after a week it un-stuck...i didn't make a fuss stuck it back and kept on using it and it didn't hold out...wasn't pleased at all.
3,not the same as my old one.,"I bought the same one 4 yrs ago. I loved it so much and needed to replace it. But this one doesn't have the same leather. The leather back then was polished and sleek, satin, while this one is more matted. The leather is just not the same quality as it once was. The buckle is the same at least."
1,No like,"When I Bought this belt. I checked the specification the material, but when I received this belt I was waiting for a great Kenneth Cole Belt, The material look like plastic, For me this belt is not good.I`m disappointed of this stuff."
2,look very cheap,"the belt look very cheap and like fake one do not buy it made from china ,i think this belt worth about $2.00"
4,Satisfying buy. Nothing fancy.,Ordered one for my dad. Realized it won't fit him. I gifted it to myself as a result and bought another one for dad.Decent buy. Exactly as described.
1,FELL APART AFTER WEARING 3 MONTHS!,"This belt literally fell apart after owning it for 3 months and with very infrequent usage. The made in China belt (though supposedly leather) appears to be a man mad plastic like material. The seam between the black and brown strips started separating in several places. Looking inside these openings, you could see it wasn't leather! I would avoid this and similar REACTION belts. A waste of money."
1,Product Damaged,"The product was damaged, because lacks one of the screws holding the strap buckle, so that the buckle is bent at any time can break. I had very good expectations about this product, now I am very dissapointed. I had very good expectations about this product, now I am very disappointed."
2,Poor Poor Poor,"Well it arrived fast, thats the only plus ...the belt was suppose to be black and brown reversible head obviously ..the brown is somekinda..mustuard ...totally not brown in any way or fashion....then the belt had the audacity to spoil in less than a week it swelled overnight because it took some tiny rain drops by my window ...could you belive that the belt sweelled and it looks awuful now..worst product i have ever bought..."
1,"poor quality, DONOT buy it!!!","Poor quality, it looks good but was broken after 2 weeks of use. DO NOT waste your money on it!!!!"
1,Belt splits in the middle,"When I got the belt, it looked pretty nice. After about 2 weeks of wearing it, I noticed that it had started to split apart in the middle. I haven't ever owned a belt that's done this, so it's clear to me that the belt must be at fault. Looking at the other 1 star reviews for this belt, this seems to happen a lot.Could I get it fixed? Perhaps, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a poorly constructed belt. It's a bit sad that Kenneth Cole can push out crap like this with such impunity."
5,Excelente,Compre esta correa para hacer un regalo y fue perfecto la persona quedo mas encantado y feliz realmente todo llego a tiempo y perfecto estado.
3,You get what you paid for.,"Overall, the belt is exactly what the site offers. I thought according to the pictures that it was thicker but is not. The brown color is too dark, almost similar to black.It's ok for the price paid."
3,Decent Product but...,The belt is good but it would really be better if it had a few more holes. I could barely use the last hole and would not even be able to use that once I lose my holiday weight.
3,Leather on reaction belt separated,"I was very excited to receive this belt. It is very fashionable and fits perfectly for casual and format events. One big thing about the belt is durability. About six months after I purchased the belt, the leather on the belt became to separate. This might be due to heavy usage, but I felt this was a big concern. I also feel that the brown side looks too similar to the black side. Other than that, the belt is not too shabby for the price."
3,Not the best quality.,"Aesthetically, the belt looks great. However, I was immediately disappointed in the build quality and craftsmanship of the belt. It doesn't feel like full leather. It is very light and easy to put on, but I'm a bit concerned about it falling apart in a few months. I was actually at Target the other day looking at belts, and the Kenneth Cole belt looks to be the same quality as some from Target. All in all, the belt is great looking, but if you are concerned about quality and build, I would stay away."
5,Nice Belt,"I've been wearing this belt for 2 years now, leather is really good and resistant, few scratches. Excellent as a dress belt.Llevo usando la correa desde hace 2 años ya, el cuero es de buena calidad y bastante resistente. La hebilla tiene pocos rayones. Es excelente como correa de vestir."
1,Mildew Smelly Belt!,"I ordered this belt as a Christmas gift for my 29 year old son. It arrived smelling moldy and mildewy! Then, I reordered the belt assuming that Amazon would pull the belts that were a smelly mess and I was wrong!!! The second belt arrived with the same horrible smell. They are a true health hazzard to anyone like me with a mold allergy, or asthma. It should be sent back to the manufacturer!!!!!"
1,Horrible service!! dont buy!!,i never even rcieved my belt in the mail and when i complained to amazon i never got my refund. more than 30 dollars down the drain. amazon left a bad taste in my mouth because of this.
1,Muy decepcionado,"La verdad es mi culpa porque revise los comentarios y no le hice caso, es de mala calidad se abre por el medio se pela, lamentable por este producto porque he comprado zapatos, reloj y otros articulos y son de muy buena calidad"
2,No es cuero,"Despues de dos semanas de uso ya empezó a romperse. No es de cuero, está hecho de plástico y goma. no recomendado. proucto de baja calidad."
4,Very nice,"Seem good quality, arrived promptly in perfect shape. I like the inner plastic sleeve. The pins are a nice addition, especially if you have the 1.5mm bit or allen wrench to attach them (1 star off for this, including no instructions)."
1,Didn't like this- or the 3rd book- at all,"Where ""The boy and his tank"" was kinda ugly but in a fun kind of way, this book- Kren of the Mitchigai and its sequel sucked. The plot is heavy with negativity, and in the end all of humanity dies.Its a very dumb book. Dogs, cats, and mice survive and become intelligent. After 1500 years you're going to tell me theres no way to find human DNA and ressurect humanity? Especially with computers hundreds of millions of times more powerfull than the ones we have now?Lame. Disappointed. Suggest ""do not buy"" because it ends with the death of all humanity."
4,"An early book - #10, 1976 - when he could still write ...","... without the unbelievable sex and violence that his later books have in gag me amounts. Compare this stand-alone, not-a-series book to his later, over-expanded 1 star books like Triumph of the Sun. Why is it that when writers get older - they lose it. Some of my favorite writers were very good early on - Dick Francis, Tony Hillerman, John Le Carre, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert B. Parker to mention a few - and in their later years pushed their imaginations and book contents in to unbelievable and unreadable plots and characters - producing barrel loads of titles and sales of products unworthy of their good early names. Sad."
2,Cry Wolf,"Cry Wolf is one of the author's weakest novels that I have read. It lacks the fast paced,informative,descriptive style that I have come to expect from Smith. The Courtney, Ballantyne, and Egypt series are far superior to Cry Wolf."
2,Cry Wolf,First of all I am a big W. Smith fan and have read and enjoyed several of his novels. However this book was a huge let down to me. I think the main problem for me was the story line and the fact that I had no interest in Italy's attempt to beat [up] an inferior ethipoian army. This book dragged and was difficult to finish. Upon completion of the book you find out that if you don't know what happend between the two nations you must do a history review. This sat rather bitter with me considering that I finished the book just to find out the outcome. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have an interest in the subject matter.
4,A grad student perspective,"The content of this book is very informative and thorough. However, the language is very ""academic"" and at times verbose. If you are purchasing this book for a class, like another reviewer on this page states, you may have to re-read portions of the book several times to fully comprehend the detail with which he writes. I would not recommend this book for an ""easy read"" about the style period."
1,Long song titles makes for brilliant techie screametal,"If you love metal played by metrosexual dudes who don haircuts equivalent to those of members of these groups; Flock of Seagulls and the Monkees. You will love these guys (and they would love you too, if you only let them.)"
1,I'm 17 form the X509X WA,"Norma Jean is not hardcore they are metalcore hardcore bands are Terror,Comeback,Bane,Champion,StandandFight,NoWarning,Somekindofhate,Withhonor,100 Demons,Blood for Blood...much much more and Slipknot is not hardcore!!!"
2,why???,"why do people like this band???I'm a major fan of Christian MEtal, but these guys are pitiful!!!!and wut's with the name's of the songs??? they don't make ne sense, honestly, don't buy this cd. Get ZAO or Demon Hunter!!!im giving this band 2 stars cuz they're rockin for the Father!"
5,Bless The Martyr And Kiss The Child!,"Pure metalcore brutality! I love this album so much I bought a backup copy! This is the album that introduced me to the world of metalcore, I've always been a metal fan, but this opened a door I wish I knew of sooner. No computer to clean up the mistakes, all songs were recorded in one take and whatever blemishes there are you hear. The music is simple compared the the follow-up album, but the impact this album had is phenomenal. This is metalcore!"
4,Hot damn.,"For months and months I'd heard good things about Norma Jean, so I finally checked them out in concert at the Orbit Room in Grand Rapids, MI with Scars of Tomorrow, Unearth, and Atreyu. Being a fan of all things metal (black, death, speed, thrash, etc.) I don't get impressed by too much. The show was uneventful until Norma Jean came on. Don't get me wrong, the three aforementioned bands were pretty sick as well, but these guys blew me away with their technical playing, vibrant and fast sound, and constant energy. It was enough to get me back in the pit after taking a ferocious punch in the eye. I bought this album after the show, and the studio tracks certainly do not disappoint. Pick it up and enjoy it."
4,These guys are supposed to be christian?,Bull. It's good music though. Their screaming sounds very artistic. Good album.
2,"To that idiot Norma Jean ""Norma""","You are f*****g idiot, Slayer is one of the best bands on this planet, and you are saying that there crap? Fall off a cliff and die pr***, what bands do you like? The Backstreet boys?And this isn't very good"
2,Groundbreaking? Unique? Original? - NOPE!,"Two years ago, everybody looked like The Strokes. Last year, everybody looked like Fall Out Boy. My question is, what will you look like when Gwar pull out another hit record?Anyway, now on to Norma Jean. I think....Hang on....Yes, Master.Hang on, Satan is trying to Instant Message me....Ok.Hey look, I got to go. Somebody in Tampa just got saved. I've got to take care of this loser.""i don't follow the crowd""- Gwar, Have You Seen Me"
1,"Be careful where you use the word ""metal"".","Previous reviews have referred to Bless the Martyr... as a metalcore release, which it is blatantly not. No track on this record deserves to be described with the word metal, it's simply noisecore. I'm sorry but I have no respect for bands that use dissonance as their only weapon. The chug-a-chug breakdowns followed by noisy pick squeals are perhaps the most overused attributes of the hardcore genre, and the disc is packed full of those and not much else. Now if metalcore is actually what you're after, there is a lot of talent to be found in any Killswitch Engage, Unearth, or As I Lay Dying release."
2,"""bore-core""","Is this band serious? Boring generic chaoticwannabe-metalcore. Nothing more than that. And the lyrics, oh yes... ""WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR! WAR!"" Hahahahahaha. They attempt to overlap the fact that they have no talent with their heavy production and dissonant chords. It doesnt quite cut it. Track 5 is 15 minutes of nonstop annoying musical ingenius. But, if you like breakdowns, this is heaven for you, becayse they cant go for long without one. Wait for the new Dillinger Escape Plan, the new Converge, the new Evelynn, or buy some Botch, and let the talented bands have their credit."
2,Eck,"Wow. The lead singer REALLY wants to sound like Sean Ingram from Coalesce. Except he doesn't, his band is boring and predictable, and they are Christian to boot.And as a side note, enough with the friggin paragraph long song titles and women's haircuts. This does not make you intellectuals. Anyone can tell from your lyrics that you aren't intellectuals; no amount of hair dye, studded belts, or pre-stained jeans will change that.If you want Christian hardcore, go Zao. They actually have talent, and their lead singer makes this fruitcake sound like Jewel."
5,Whoa,"Well, I must say that I am proud that I own this cd, more than I am proud of my entire collection. This can't be classified as metal, it's more of somewhat controlled chaos. It's like dillenger escape plan's style, except it has much more form to it, and the lyrics are incredible. Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child is definatly not the ""Luti-Kriss"" it was before. Chaotic guitars, very noteworth bass work, and some of the best drumming I've heard since Zao's ""Self-Titled"". And the vocal diversity is incredible. Buy this album and you will not regret it."
4,Hard hitting hardcore at its best,"First of all dont listen to MAD Pirahna's review, to say that Norma Jean lacks any musical talent could only come from someone with no musical talent themselves and no concept of what musical talent is. This aside bless the martyr is a powerful metal tinged hardcore record with explosive riffs and intricate leads that add a creepy feel to the music, the vocals are constantly brutal and full of energy. all up I think this is a great Hardcore/Metal record that is worth your time if you are at all into this kind of music."
3,Meh.,"This isn't bad. ""Memphis Will Be Laid To Waste"" is a great song, and is the foundation for the whole album. There's just not a whole lot to this album. The songs have some boring parts. Sometimes they see, to lag on a bit. Overall,the length of this cd hurt it the most. Another thing that bothers me about this album is the distortion on Josh's vocals. If you've heard anything by The Chariot you'd know what Josh can really do. He really doesn't need that distortion on his vocals. With The Chariot he's one of my favorite vocalists, but not so much on this cd. I recommend The Chariot over Norma Jean."
1,what??!?!?!,what is this?!?!this isnt music...heck i shouldnt have even given it one star. this is a bunch of noise? what the heck...this sucks do not waste your money on this band!
1,Fake wanna be metal strikes again...,"I suppose I shouldnt call it even wannabe metal since it isnt even that... this is absolute garbage.This isnt even music really, there is so little talent shown by the band and so much repetitive pointless boring noise that it's simply mindboggling, in a bad sort of way. THIS IS NOT METAL. And believe me, I dont hate this band because it's too ""br00tal"" for me or something absurd like this. The two bands mentioned below are quite brutal and exceed this junk far more than I care to think about.If you want some REAL christian metal get a little gem called ""Solace"", by Lengsel, a Norweigan Black Metal band. You'll be blown away.If you want good non-christian metal music, try ""Frost"" by Enslaved, again black metal."
1,Give me a break,"Ok, where do I begin. This is the WORST metal, hardcore album I have ever bought or listened to. It reminds me of the other crappy band Spitfire that came and went. For the freakin' life of me, I don't understand why so many people praise this album. It's just plain stupid and irritating; it's like listening to a bunch of monkeys scraping their nails down and chalk board and beating garbage cans with tree limbs. This group is horrible, horrible, horrible. Don't waste your money like I did ( I should send it back).And one more thing, Solid State Records has got to stop giving every smuck, wanna-be band who comes along a record deal. For crying out loud, if they're looking for talent, look harder! Give me a freakin' BREAK!"
4,Good album,"I think this is a great cd, I like almost every song on there. This is a band that will easily take out the days frustration. And as far as the christian thing goes, well i had this cd for a good 4 months before i even found out they were ""christian"" and was told so by a friend. Theres definatly no ""gods word"" or anything like that so dont be detered from getting a very good piece of work. This is perfect for anyone that appreciates heavy bands and ruthless screaming."
1,I just don't understand why everyone has a hard-on for Norma Jean...,"I have NO idea why everyone loves these guys. I've seen them live and listened to their Cd and it is god awful. They are sloppy. They have riffs I thought of when I was 12. The two guitars don't even go together in most parts. And to hell with if they techinically go together on the scales, it just sounds awkward. And to top it all off, the singer's generic scream and terrible delivery make this pile of garbage complete. The bassist just sits in the background, and the drummer wishes he was playing something else. I don't know what else, but not the riffs he's supposed to be playing."
5,"Very fun, beautiful art, awesome game","We are board game geeks and love board games. My sister owns over 100 and I try to get ones that are different than hers. However, this is the only game I bought that she already owned because I love it so much. The artwork is fantastic and there are many little pieces, which I love. The board game is random tiles so it changes every time you play. There are many things you would like to do on your turn, whether it is progress yourself or stop someone else from progressing. It's a delicate balance to achieve in a board game. The fact that you score throughout the game and not just at the end really makes it anyone's game. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is sick of Monopoly."
4,"FANTASTIC game, but MUCH bigger than 6""x6""x1""","I'm a long-time lover of Rio Grande games, and I'd been eying this one for a while. I finally ordered it, and loved it, but you should know the box is BIG. Product dimensions are listed as 6 inches by 6 inches by 1 inch, but this is more like one foot wide, two feet long, and a couple inches deep. I had pictured a box like Lost Cities or Kahuna, but it was much, much bigger.This is a great game that the husband and I play a lot, but we're skittish about taking it to our weekly game night, due to the high number of small pieces. The pieces require a bit of set up, but once it's ready to go, it's another great game from another great publisher. The first time we played it, we each pretty much stayed to our side of the board, building up our resources in that area. Since then, our games have gotten a little predatory, and it makes for a much more interesting gameplay. I'm itching to see how cutthroat it gets with four players."
4,Great Alternative To Carrying Buckets New Model Has Improvments,"Having multiple tanks for over 30 years anthing that makes the tasks of water changes and refills is a welcome relife. No more carrying buckets and the Python is a real time saver.The adapter has been uopgraded to brass over plastic so the fit is much better but you'll still get some spray on high water pressure so just cover the back part of the faucet with a towel. I drained a 55 in about 30 minutes which is pretty decent time and my back thanks me.Perfect for multiple water changes, simply treat the water in the tank - I've been using Prime by Seachem for years and swear by it. On the weak side - the hose is very soft and pliable making it easy to kink. In addition the connections ALL leak and spray so again, a little plumbers tape goes a long way. But these small headaches aside the Python is a superb method to use in the care of your tanks."
4,A helpful tool,"I bought this as a replacement for another No Spill Clean and Fill that I purchased in 2002. The hose had split because of a kink in the hose that resulted from storage. The negative about this product is that it is very difficult to store. After awhile, no matter how much you unravel the hose, it will kink and be extremely difficult to roll back up. Still, the hose lasted 4 years, which makes it a decent investment.In terms of water changes, it really depends on the size of your tanks. I have a 50 gallon, and it helps to use the Python for large water changes. *Frequent* water changes, which are supposed to increase as a result of using this product (according to Python themselves), aren't really that frequent because like I said above, it's a pain to unroll and roll back up. I would say that for anything less than 50 gallons, it's probably easier to bring out the bucket and siphon.Overall, this is a good product. I just wish there was an easier way to store the thing."
5,no closed captions,Although I am in England I have a universal player and buy many dvs from the States .As I am hard of hearing I need the Closed Captions or Sub Titles which you say are on the disc.WELL they are notI came over to New York last month and took my US copy with me to Toer and The dvd dept of Macys both proved that there are no CCs on the disc or the menu.Lickily all the performers have perfect diction-Esp ROSE no Two so tou can hear but I wanted to advise you there are no ccs on the DdiscPRINCE RAFAEL
3,What were they thinking?,"The producers of this release had no respect for the programs or the people who buy them. I was shocked to see that each episode has, superimposed over them, SHOW 2 SERIES2, and the like. We all know the shows are great and the special features would be great (if I bothered to get past the first 2 minutes of the first show). My set is on it's way back to Amazon hoping I'll get a refund."
3,"Fine actors, terrible writing...","I've never understood the seemingly unanimous praise for this mostly unfunny series. Without question, the cast is a distinguished group, and all manage to add flair and charm to their roles (most noteable Patricia Routledge - one of Britain's most under-rated actors) but Roy Clarke's writing is, for the most part, flat and lacks any of the sharpness British sitcoms are known for. The plots rely more on Routledge's brilliant physical acting than on story, and the few jokes scattered throughout are generally unoriginal and unfunny (it should be known that the series does rise above on occasion). ""KUA"" never decides whether it's aiming for social commentary or just cheap laughs (""Absolutely Fabulous"" is far more successful at lampooning it's chosen cultural target)."
4,Great....but.........,"I love the superior picture quality and terrific sound of this DVD set; Hyacinth would be proud. The only irksome complaint I have about it is that at the beginning of each episode, they've added ""series one-episode --"". This would be fine if they'd have done it on a separate frame instead of super-imposing it over the action. Very annoying and ruins the authenticity of the series. As a whole, though, it's a great set and I'm glad I own it but if future episodes are released on DVD, I do hope they do it like the ""Are You Being Served"" set and put the comentary on separate frame, BEFORE the episode begins."
5,"""No, this is NOT a Chinese takeaway.""","""It's a white slim-line telephone surrounded by expensive wallpaper.""I love this series, and I hope BBC will release the remaining episodes. I find it interesting that the four sisters all have floral names: Hyacinthe, Rose, Daisy and Violet. It's difficult to understand how Richard keeps his sanity as he has no chance to make any decisions of his own, even though Hyacinth keeps telling anyone within earshot that he's a manager with a very large and important firm. Onslow's car isn't the only thing that backfires in these episodes. Hyacinth's schemes backfire as well, making funny situations even funnier.I would personally rather go for a pint at the pub with Onslow than attend one of Hyacinth's candle-light suppers.This is definitely a MUST-have set, but don't brush against the wallpaper and mind the crumbs."
5,Hyacinth is my hero,I am addicted to this show. I started watching it on PBS several months ago and now I won't miss an episode. I started taping them when I was not home and began watching them on the BBC in addition to PBS. Now that I found that the DVD's are available I have begun purchasing them as quickly as I can. Love that Hyacinth.... She is a hoot. She is my new role model..... The acting is wonderful especially that of Patricia Routledge. Her facial expressions are priceless. The other characters who have to endure Hyacinths endless demands and pretense are just fantastic. Poor Richard. And I can just feel Elisabeth cringe everytime Hyacinth summons her for coffee. Just wonderful....
2,The video kept freezing,"I watched 2 episodes of Keeping Up Appearances, the video on the 3rd episode froze several times and kept saying loading. I checked my internet connection and it was fine. I have high speed bradband, so its Amazons problem. I hate to know I spent 79.95 for this by buying prime!"
1,Disappointed,The dvd's would not play. I was very disappointed because none of the discs would play completely through. Not impressed.
5,Very Funny,Great Show. Very entertaining and funny especially if you like british TV. I have watched over and over and have laughed each time. Highly recommend.
4,Simply Wonderful,"While there are many forms of Indian music missing, the contents of this CD will thrill anyone who loves classical Indian music. Be prepared for a true listening adventure. I only gave it four stars because, while I think the piece by Ravi Shankar is very good, I would not consider it representative of his best work. However, the other works represent the artists well.This album would be great as an introduction to classical Indian music or a as a valuable addition to any library of Indian music."
5,Beautiful,"Francoise Sagan's sublime second outing captures the essence of love. It is the tale of Dominique, a young French woman, who's honest assessment of her life leads to the realisation that feelings for her current boyfriend are only that of fondness, not love. An encounter with her boyfriend's uncle unfolds into new love, friendships and understanding.A beautiful, somewhat sad piece, with the flowing charm of Sagan's previous work, Bonjour Tristesse. Perceptive and enchanting, Mlle Sagan has produced a book that has captured, as well as anyone ever has, love through the eyes of youth."
3,Halloween accessory,"The boys wanted to be Sherlock for dress up. These pieces finished their ensemble perfect. I don't think the pipe will last very long as a play thing, but it was what we were looking for and the price was right. Everything arrived just fine and as described. I would use this company again."
2,"Pipe great, hat not","The detective hat is just what other people are saying: it's too small for an adult head. May work fine for a kid. It's got one of those cheap elastic bands, so depending on the size of your head, it may or may not feel comfortable (felt kind of scratchy to me). The pipe, however, is perfect, and usually costs about $5 anyway. Since I already had a pipe, I was really focusing on the hat, and since the hat was no good, I returned the whole thing."
4,Detective Hat,"Needed some Sherlock Holmes hats for an educational skit. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality compared to the price. Made of cotton fabric. Depth of hat a bit shallow, but suspect designed for kids. Overall, the product met my needs and received smiles from the audience. Need to use the hats 4 times this year, and feel certain they will survive."
4,Bought it for my brother.,"he wore it for halloween. love the plastic pipe, it sure added a lot to his costume. thank you very much!"
3,Detective week.,Bought this for my child's detective week at summer camp. Obviously couldn't use the pipe and wish it came with a magnifying glass. The costume was a little bit of a flop because kid's don't know who Sherlock Holmes is these days. ;-) The hat is pretty good quality.
2,Would only fit a child,"We bought this for my fiance to wear for Halloween, but the hat is too small for any adult to wear. It is definitely a child-sized hat. The pipe is really nice though. Unlike other costume pipes, it does not have writing on it. So, if you just want the pipe, this set is fine, but if you want the hat to fit an adult, look elsewhere."
1,Junk,"The hat is way too small to wear, and the pipe really looks cheap. You can get a better product in a thrift store, really."
5,Incredible 1st single of the brilliant Head Music CD,"Once again, Suede have proved to be the hottest Brit-pop band. Electricity is a killer single and a powerhouse live number (the shows I have seen in Europe have been amazing). This is a high energy and intoxicating song. It grabs a hold of the listener and doesn't let you go. Waterloo (Neil Coddling wrote and sings this song) is utterly breathtaking. Buy It!!! You will not be disapointed."
4,Surprisingly Good Read,"I rarely, if ever, read historical romance novels. But this one actually held my attention and brought tears to my eyes. While most of their issues could be resolved with a simple conversation, I found it both heart-wrenching and endearing."
1,Terrible book!,"By the halfway point, I got tired of the repetitious misunderstandings and the completely unlikable characters (esp. Max, who is the kind of emotionally abusive psycho boyfriend that after-school specials always warned me against.) I did end up finishing this book, though that had more to do with the fact that I was bored and it was free."
4,VERY SURPRISED,"I have never read this type of love story book but it was free (i would pay for it), I LOVED IT! I went into it very judgemental but was happily surprised. It had a good story and played out well. I found myself yelling at the book saying ""would you stop being such an idiot"", and I laughed. I have recommended this to several friends already - hope you enjoy!"
3,"Liked it, but...","It is a bit contrived as many in this genre are. The continual misunderstanings and taking so lng to figure out that she was pregnant did get tiresome, However, I liked the twists and seeing the aunt and uncle get there due was satisfying. I would have liked to see his aunt get a good ""set down"" too. It was a good relaxing read."
5,his lady mistress,I decided to read this book because it was free on the kindle and I found it to be amazing and I can't wait to read more of her stuff.
2,How about a little communication people?,"This will be a short review because plenty of other people have written about the plot. I will first say that I am glad that this was a free story or else I would have felt ripped off. I don't mind a little misunderstanding between characters as long as they don't take very long but these misunderstandings take up at least 80% of the book. All they needed to do was sit down and actually talk to each other but they don't until the very end of the book. Instead it is one bad conversation after another, if you could even call them conversations. The main characters never really listened to each other. They jumped to rash and very foolish conclusions and would end the conversation instead of sharing their thoughts and feelings. Verity was also way too much of a martyr for my tastes as well. Give me a women with a little strength please."
1,Awful poorly developed plotline,"For a romance novel it started off interesting. A mysterious stranger who comes to a grieving girl's rescue, powerful emotion, and interesting introduction of characters. After the first few chapters, however, there was really nothing more to recommend it.Verity, the heroine, quickly became a spineless, self-persecuted, weeping, pitiful character. It was hard to empathize with her or the plotline when I had the strong urge to tell her to stop her self-loathing and quit playing the victim.The hero, Max, was also difficult to respect. He was too busy perpetuating one misunderstanding after another, calling Verity a whore, or wallowing in self-pity."
2,Too many misunderstandings,"the story line needed help. Too many times was one of the couple misunderstood by the other. I MEAN, after 4 or more times I could see it coming. I finished it just to get to the happy ending. Needed more something. Not sure what, or could have been shorter."
1,Hero with a mile-wide Mean Streak,"...and extreme mood swings pretty much signals severe personality disorder. Run, Verity, run! As other revewers have said, Max starts out well but quickly turns into a jerk for wholly imagined reasons. The lame big misunderstandings are too frequent and lack believability. Plot has a retro 80s feel - and not in a good way."
4,Good book but only once,"I liked this book - especially since it was free. I read it and didn't want to put it down because I found it interesting, until I got to the middle then it went on and on. Then it threw out a twist, which was good, but then went back to the same on and on. I guess it was the time the story was written in which women can't communicate with their husbands. He was always thinking she didn't love him and then she was always thinking how he didn't love her....geez! How can they get so confused and then manipulate themselves so much. But it was good. I wouldn't read it again, but I am glad I read it once."
4,Good brain candy,"I downloaded this book because it was free and I like some good brain candy every once in a while. I really enjoyed it. Was it a bit frustrating at points? Yes, but so is life for that matter. I liked the story and always like a good happy ending. Am I glad I downloaded it? Most definitely!"
3,Hmmm,"For some reason, I am finding a lot of romance novels center around abusive men and women who fall for them. I mean, this book did not strike me as realistic, but, I have known a few people who actually were in these types of dysfunctional relationships..so, in a way, I believe this situation could happen.Back to the story, there was way too many mind games for me..and the man, wasn't a real man in my opinion. He would abuse his wife who he forced to marry, then wait for her to come to him..It was mental. And she, was constantly crying and shaking in a corner somewhere..She was described as completely feeble. Also, there could have been more adjectives then was used in the story. There were a lot of repeated lines, and he always wanted to sweep her out of a chair, or, what she said sent a spear through him.....whatever."
4,a great read,such a great read for a free book! I was pleasantly surprised. i'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series.
4,Great for a free book,"This is one of the only free Kindle downloads that was worth the time. Not the best historical romance I've ever read, but it is well developed and interesting. Thanks for the free read!"
2,This is a skip!,This book jumps around too much and leaves the reader confused. I only loaded this because it was free and now I know why. Skip this one. I'm only 1/3 of the way through and I'm not going to read the rest. It will put you to sleep.
1,Not a good book.,"This was a free Kindle download for me, too. Otherwise, no way. The so-called hero is MEAN. He is a BAD MAN. These two don't just seem naive to being in love, they seem unfamiliar with being humans. He asks her to be his mistress and soon is FURIOUS that she wanted to be his mistress? He tells her becoming his mistress would take her away from all this, then wonders why she'd want to get away from all this? She has no family, money, clothes, friends, self-esteem...She's verbally, emotionally, and physically abused...He's horny and for the most part, without empathy. Even a happy ending here isn't happy."
3,okay...,"As someone new to the romance genre (yay free books!), I don't know what to expect. The plot's mildly interesting although the characters' mood swings are occasionally hard to follow. But hey, for a free book, it's not so bad."
2,Stupid,I got this book on my Kindle because it was free. I like historical books but this was not even very good. The plot had promise and she could have done so much with it but fell short. I don't think I will read another even if it was given to me.The sex was almost pornographic and it did not add any value to the book.
4,the good news and the bad news,"It's been years since I read a Harlequin. Well written in some places - Elizabth Roll is a wordsmith at times and other times the narrative is disappointing. The characters are contradictory - Lord and Lady Blakehurst are at times both strong and weak. He's supposed to be experienced in the ways of women, but he fails in the most amusing ways to be able to pull himself together sufficiently to communicate with his wife. Thank goodness they had the dogs for comic relief... anyway, enjoyed it - as a freebie. I probably would not have purchased it on my own if there were a cost."
2,"great historical setting, horrible characters","Great sex scenes and the build up of tension, though there is some suspense of belief here, like how the hero couldn't tell the girl was a virgin just because he had all these misconceptions (he had thought she had been previously ravaged for her master, who is in fact her psycho cousin.) And the hero treats the heroine like garbage, a really bad message for women here, because Verity blames herself for faults that really don't amount to anything in my honest opinion, and yes, if they just sit down and talked, the book would have last ended in 50 pages. For a free ebook, it's great. For a satisfying historical romance read, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,well-written,"The death of her father left, Verity Scott, in a state of distraught...but in these trying times she befriended a gentlemanly soldier named Max...and her father just happened to be his commanding officer. Five years later, Verity finds herself working as a handmaiden and Max mysteriously reenters her life. She discovers that he is the Lord of Bakehurst...but realizes that Max does not remember her...and sees her as a lowly maid. Yet, it is the poor way she is being treated that drives Max into her arms. When Max finally does realize who she is, he insists that they get married. The story goes back and forth like this as Max looks to embrace her then decides to push her away. Will they get married or will their passion for each other drive them apart? This was a very well-written historical romance....I would also highly recommend JoAnna Wylde's novel Price of Freedom:Price of Freedomanother incredibly well-written book."
2,Don't understand the high rating,"I don't understand the high ratings given this book. I'm a long-time romance reader, and I'm not really too picky about what I enjoy. I was looking for a new author to try, and gave this a whirl. I was extremely disappointed. It is predictable, repetitious, contains all the genre's cliche characters, and if the heroine cried one more time, I would have thrown the book at the wall. There are moments of quite good writing, and maybe with a tough editor this author could put it all together and produce a fine book. I'm sorry to say that there are many wonderful romances, but this isn't one of them."
4,His Lady Mistress,"I was never one to read Romance Novels. This would be the first. I really enjoyed this book immensely! I could not put the book down (my kindle, anyways). It made me have to download the follow-up book. The love story was so vivid I actually cried. So good, that I had to write a review for the first time as well"
5,Just what I wanted,"This well written story of misunderstandings and true love fulfilled everything I look for in a romance novel. Verity is a nuanced and wholly understandable heroine, and Max is a captivating (if stubbornly wool-headed) lead male. I loved it and wish I could read it for the first time all over again."
5,Lots of ups and downs,"I really enjoyed this book, lots of ups and downs and one drama after another, kept me pretty entertained i found it difficult to put the book down. Shows how there can be a thin line between love and hate. I enjoyed this book very much."
1,pathetic,This book is so not worth the time it was spent to read it. One of the worst books I have read. Thank goodness it was free.
3,Depressing,"I liked the idea of this story but the characters were so depressing. They could never tell each other how they felt and continued to have misunderstanding, and fights till it drove me crazy. At the end i almost didnt even want them to be together because all they did was hurt each other. If you are looking for a light fun romantic story this is not it."
2,His Lady Mistress,Do people even talk to each other? Time and Time again its one massive miscommunication after the next. I wanted to smack the both of them for not talking to each other. I like historical romance but this one just drove me nuts
4,A Nice Read!,"I really enjoyed this story and especially loved the heroine. The hero, not so much. He was quite an idiot and there was no redemption (in my opinion) for him throughout the book. That is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I will definately check out her other novels. Thanks for a cheap and enjoyable Kindle read!"
4,I read it in one night,It was an adorable story. I felt the author did make Varity shake a little to much and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. Other than that it was a delightful story that I could not put down. I read it one night. That's the mark of a good read.
4,Great book but...,"the male lead was a total jerk most of the book!! I felt so bad for Verity! She reminded me of a puppy who no matter how many times it's kicked keeps coming back hoping for love. I wanted her to worry about herself for once (and the scene with her horrible cousin...loved it!) and stop trying to please everyone else. But she was definitely lovable. As far as Max is concerned, I liked him in the beginning, but he was terrible to her all through this book. It is definitely a good read for being a free book, but I just didn't like that the male lead was so unforgiving."
5,Pride and Prejudice meets Cinderella,"If you like Pride and Prejudice, and if you also like Cinderella, you will also like this book. Has a good bit of ""romance novel"" scenes, but not too much. I read lots of free Kindle books. Usually I like them okay. This one really had me hooked! I read the whole thing in less than 24 hours!I also liked the language of the book, and the way things were described. It made it feel more like I was back in that time period. It didn't use too many words I had to look up, and when I came across a word I didn't know, I just used the Kindle dictionary.Recommended if you like Romance Novels, Pride and Prejudice, and Cinderella."
4,Adorable - my daughter loved the alarm clock and robe,"My 5 year old received this item for Christmas last year for her baby born doll. She loved the alarm clock and we used it one morning (be prepared - it is loud). The robe is well made and adorable, as well as the little booties that come along with it. Baby born is one of my daughters' favorite dolls, and she looks great in her new outfit."
5,Very well made,"This was for an video connection for a combo VHS/DVD unit I have which on the DVD side has HDMI. (The audio required two separate cables.)I didn't compare this cable with any other as I wanted a cable that was better than the thin wire ones that are typically supplied with almost all units. I can only say that it works really well, and this is in contrast to other VHS units I have had.Plus it is very well made."
5,HER BEST TO DATE,"If an artist's music is a reflection of their soul, Patty loveless has more soul than any artist today. I didn't think it would be possible to top ""When Fallen Angels Fly"" but not only has she topped it, she has taken this album to new heights. From ""High On Love"" to ""Too Many Memories"", Patty scales the gamut of gut busting blues to upbeat and bouncy. If the rating system were higher I would rate it at least 10 stars."
3,Only If You Prefer Her Ballads,"With just a few exceptions, this is primarily a collection of ballads. Of course, a couple of them (""To Have You Back Again"", & her duet with George Jones, ""You Don't Seem to Miss Me"") are excellent. ""High On Love"" is a very good country-rocker. But overall, I don't think it's nearly as good as the TROUBLE WITH THE TRUTH cd. It certainly doesn't have the variety that one has."
5,No love less with this babe,"Patty does it again & again. You don't need a ten gallon hat and boots to love Patty Loveless. . .Her rendition of Stephen Bruton's ""Too Many Memories"" is staggering. The angels are crying when Patty sings this song. . .Patty Loveless who is full of love. . .Blues to Blood: Doing It the Hard Way: Music, Addiction & Recovery"
5,Traditional/Contemporary Country At It's Best!!,"This is another great album from Patty,as always!There's the big hits To Have You Back Again(great song)High On Love and the excellent duet with legendary George Jones You Don't Seem To Miss Me.There voices really gel nicely together on this.There's also some other great songs like the uptempo The Party Ain't Over Yet,the lovely ballads I Don't Want To Feel Like That and Too Many Memories.She ends the album with the gorgeous Where I'm Bound,I love the arrangement on this.Patty always makes a fantastic album,sung with lots of passion and soul.So this album will not disappoint...."
1,Old distro!!!!,"This is old, unsupported distro, with no updates and customer service! My brother bought it for me, I don't know what he was thinking buying this system. When I tried to install it, my computer screamed like it's about to be dead. It was scary."
3,Not the best core surgical textbook,Many typos found throughout the pages and overall poorly written chapters. The exception is the vascular chapters which are helpful. I would recommend Sabiston over Greenfield as a core surgical text.
5,This Product Works,Use it every time I come out of the woods and every time I go it. I even put some in a small carry bottle to re-spray after I stop sweating after walking through woods to my stand. So far I've had plenty of deer downwind and none have made me.
5,NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART,"NEVER BURN A WITCH is the second Rowan Gant Investigation, following HARM NONE.Someone is running around St Louis with an apostolic way of thinking. They truly believe God is directing their path and that it is their duty to rid the earth of witches.Brianna Louise Walker took a nosedive off of the sixth story balcony of the Riverfront Hilton handcuffed. The monogram of Christ was carved into her inner thighs by the murderer to purify her because of her profession. The second murder is even more gruesome.Rowan Gant is back to help his best friend, police officer Ben Storm, because a serial killer is on the loose, and it's up to them to solve these murders before the next one occurs.I found NEVER BURN A WITCH to have a very strong plot. It moves along at a fast pace and delivers lots of suspense. M.R. Sellers writes with such graphic descriptions that you feel you are there witnessing it with your own eyes. This is not a read for the faint of heart."
5,Never Burn A Witch,WOW!! Just like the first book - Harm None - M.R. Sellars puts you in the middle of the action! This book is surperbly written and the charactors are like your best friends. Keep up the good work M.R. Sellars! When is the next book?
1,Needs editing,"There may be a good story here, but the book is in desperate need of professional editing. The author drowns the story in extremely detailed descriptions of everything - which is often not necessary. I would love to see this re-written more crisply, with more character development. I do believe the author has talent, but needs to study his craft more."
5,"Never Again The Burning Times, but they are BACK!!!","This book reached out and took hold of my attention from the very beginning, there was no, ""period of getting into the story"", I was hooked from the beginning and really enjoyed this edge of your seat mystery, adventure, paranormal, and more READ. It fascinated me. Simply put this book gives away NOTHING, you don't have a clue whodunit til the very end! Well written and intense, it keeps you on the edge of your seat until you are released at the end! I highly recommend this book to many varied readers! This is the 3rd piece of M. R. Sellars I have read and each one gets better and better! I am looking forward to the Next Book ""Perfect Trust""! In fact have already started it!"
5,nice book for 2nd grader,A good book to read to kindergarden and 1st grader. Have to be a 2nd grader or higher to read on own.
1,Did the author even visit the westside of the island?,"This book is a real let down.The suggested itineraries are absurd. The one week itinerary actually suggests that you try to visit the whole island in one week, which would involve you spending most of your time in the car!Most of the recomended best beaches are a bunch of flat, crowded, over-developed boring beaches next to the big cities. When actually Sicily is full of beautiful picturesque beaches set amongst interesting rocky cliffs off the beaten track.Furthermore, it seems that the writer never even visted the west side of the island. There is only 18 pages on the west side of the island, and the Egadi Islands are not even mentioned.I would not recomend this book, especially if you intend to visit the westside of the island."
1,The worst travel guide ever!,"This is not one of the worse but THE worst travel guide ever!!! I am someone who has traveled extensively worldwide, including throughout Italy, and I used this guide in my recent trip to Sicily (I just came back), which was the only place in Italy where I hadn't been before. The person who wrote this guideFrommer's Sicily (Frommer's Complete)has no judgement and apparently had never traveled before in his life in order to be able to appreciate what is worth visiting and what is not. This guide is not only misleading but it is also full of inaccurate information --enough to send you to the wrong places on the wrong days and times (e.g., wrong hotel addresses; wrong opening days and hours for museums, etc)."
2,Disappointed - Not the Elder Frommer's Approach,"Although this book provides some useful information on sites and the location of some restaurants, stores and hotels, I was disappointed that the book did not take a more practical, dollar-wise approach to touring Sicily. Definitely not the approach Arthur Frommer would take. Other books on Sicily are more insightful and do not waste your time pointing you toward the more glitzy, materialistic sites."
1,Implosion: Book collapses under the wieght of mediocrity,"Oceanspace shows signficant promise from it's jacket blurb, through the intro, until the cast is assembled on the underwater research facility, the Tethys.Then, the last three hundred pages are wasted on boring and uni-dimensional characters, a pointless story, and a cliched sea-serpent. While I applaud the technical detail which gives the atmosphere a sense of authenticity, I comdemn everything else. Steele never decides if this book will be a creature-feature, action-thriller, or character drama. He attempts to please all and (of course, the cliches abound even outside the story) pleases no one.This was my first Steele book. It will definitely be my last. Believe me, if Amazon would allow a zero-star rating, this book would earn that mark."
2,I miss being a kid,"I think I know the trouble with science fiction now: I firstenjoyed it -- immensely -- as a wide-eyed kid. The ideas, the alienvistas, the adventure -- all captured my imagination.But clearly in many cases -- I hate to admit -- I was unaware of the plain, even awkward, writing and paper-thin characterizations.Allen Steele. The guy attracts me each time, no doubt tapping into my yearning to find the Sense of Wonder. So I try him and try him, only to find that his characters are tepid stereotypes, and the plotting rather by rote.""Oceanspace"" is written to pop-fiction specifications: Utterly lame characters -- the teenager is the worst kind of stereotype, an embarrassing cliche -- and the writing is just, well, documentary and plodding.I finished the book, but I must say I'm disappointed: The plot -- ie: Sense of Wonder -- ain't enough to sustain this jaded old sf kid."
2,Could have been good - but it wasn't,"I was hoping for great things on this one - I'd enjoyed Clarke County Space and Lunar Descent so was hoping for something just as good in a watery setting.At the start you jump right into some action with no messing about followed but some nice hard science, but after that it all goes downhill. When you get to parts of a book and just cringe (the unsucessful seduction scene) you know it's not going well.When I finished it I just wondered what happened to the the 'greatest discovery of all' mentioned on the back cover - in fact, what happened to the entire ending?My advice : read Orson Scott Card novel 'The Abyss' (based on the screenplay of the film) instead. Similar hard SF stuff, but much, much better characterisation and a rewarding ending well worth the wait."
4,underwater suspense,"I loved this book. The author ties together a few storylines that he prefectively describes in detail into one huge climax. For example, you feel like you were in the sub as it descended towards the lab underwater. The episode where the whaling ship is dismantled by a computer virus was hilarious. The only problem with the story had to be the build-up of the mysterious creature and the quick departure from the author. But, you like the way the main characters are handled especially the journalist."
3,"Fun read, altogether pretty hollow","I read this book in one sitting and thought it was great until about the last hundred pages where it seemed that the author tried to wrap things up a little too neatly. The book was pretty good, but the ending was pitiful, I mean the sea monster making a cameo appearance?...please."
3,Big book on big whale,"Is Harriet Klausner insane or is she a PR flack for some publisher? What's with the hundreds of reviews appearing under her name, each reading like the blurb on a book jacket. Yikes."
2,I had the same problem...,I saw the warnings shortly after I bought this thing... so I was extra careful when decorating. I even handwashed all the parts except the metal tube. I loved it until just yesterday it broke.Guess I'll try plain old pastry bags...
2,The spring loaded gun breaks within minutes!,"First one I bought: the spring (the part you press with your thumb to meter out the frosting) broke before I was even done decorating my cake.Returned to BBBeyond for second one, that spring also broke before I was even finished decorating my cupcakes.Returned for third, and it also broke during the first batch of frosting.Bottom line: I REALLY wanted to LOVE this product. But after dealing with 3 of these I decided to just keep the 3rd one and deal with manually pushing out the frosting myself. Too much money and aggrivation, Wilton! Make a product that works!That said, this product is incredibly fun for my 3 year old who does not care about what the decorative frosting looks like :)"
2,known problem,Bought this for my daughter. It has broke at the thumb plunger.called the company and they said it was a known defect..sending out replacement parts but they are out for now.its been 4 Weeks and they are not sure when they will be in. I wouldn't buy this if I were going to use it to much. The body is sturdy but the plastic parts seemed cheap
3,great if it works!,I loved this product at first. I frosted 100+ cupcakes with easy with the extra large tips. I wanted to write so I put on the stand small tip and it broke right away. But I called wilton and they will send a replacement thumb lever when they come in. no charge to me. so at least Wilton is aware of the issues and helping customers.
3,Works great until the thumb trigger breaks off,"I have arthritis and was very hopeful about using this tool. For the first 5 minutes, it worked great and I loved it. However, the glaze I was piping was not all that stiff and the thumb trigger broke off! I first thought it popped out, but then saw it actually broke right off. I have email out to Wilton to see if a replacement part is sold and a request for a re-engineering of the trigger mechanism. If they get that right, the tool will be invaluable to those of us who don't have use of our hands anymore!"
2,disappointed,I only used the decorator a couple of times before the lever broke. It is very difficult to use now. I am very disappointed in this product.
5,Excellent helper,"Sometimes when using the bags my hands would get too tired. After purchasing this, it has made my life so much easier. I love the fact that it fits almost all tips and it makes clean up a breeze."
2,looks can be deceiving - breaks easily,I agree with most of the 2-star reviews. It is nice and works great the first couple of times. The catch just moves around and doesn't extrude anymore. I loved that you can use your own tips but frankly it isn't as sturdy as it looks. Wilton needs to go backt to the drawing board with this one. Have the catch redesigned!!
2,great at first...,"Easy to use. However, not well made... I had mine for almost half a year and already it does not work."
2,Only use a few times,I wish I had looked at the reviews for this. Simply put I only used it a few times before it stopped working. To finish decorating the cupcakes I had to push for the top (not the lever) which made it a little awkward. I am now searching for something similar (the concept is great) that has good reviews.
2,It's great... until it breaks!,"I am by no means a professional cake decorator but with five children I have decorated many a cake. I really liked this product as it is easy to use and easy to clean etc. and I am not a fan of a pastry bag. The problem is- the button you push down on to dispense the frosting breaks! I thought it was a fluke thing, but then bought another one and the same exact thing happened! Very disappointed and I won't bother purchasing another... as I'm sure the end result would be the same. Too bad!"
2,Doesn't last,"This was great--while it worked. I purchased two: the first one broke and the thumb portion broke on the second one. I am NOT purchasing a third one!! If it had been made with metal, it would have lasted!!"
2,Loved...didn't last!!,I got this decorator in time for my son's first birthday. It worked great...I loved it. I went to use it for the second time to make Christmas cookies less than two months later and the thumb press wouldn't catch. I couldn't believe I didn't even get to use it twice.Very disappointing.
2,breaks,"I bought this item and within three months it was broken. I used this item approximately five to six times. The thumb lever broke rendering the item completely useless. I've read reviews about the Wilton cookie press and it seems to have the same problem...it's junk. I've always thought Wilton products to be above average quality, but I'm learning differently....it was a costly lesson."
2,same experience as other 2-star reviewers,"seems this item has a real problem with longevity in the thumb press. i used mine to create about a half dozen cakes before it malfunctioned. the thumb piece no longer catches, making it near impossible to depress the frosting. anyone know of a better product? or do we have to resort to using decorating bags?"
2,Not worth the money,At first I loved this decorator pro as it was a larger container than my previous one. I only used this 4 or 5 times before the plastic thumb lever snapped off. It is almost impossible to decorate with enough accuracy with the plunger on the top of the product. Waste of money. If Wilton would have made the thumb press out of metal it would be great.
1,Thumb Press Broke,I bought this because my 2 prior Decorator's broke. Thought I needed to spend more money to get better quality. I was wrong. I loved this decorator for the three times I got to use it. Then the thumb press broke while piping buttercream frosting. Really? Total waste of money.
1,Junk...just junk,"I got this a few years ago. Worked great the first few times, then the thumb lever broke. I called Wiltons they sent me a few replacement thumb levers. Everytime I use it I get 1-2 uses out of it. I expected more from Wiltons. The first time it broke I was in the middle of making my son a Thomas The Tank Engine cake. I had to run to my moms so I could use her 30 yr old one. Not a Wiltons. I have one thumb piece left. I am looking for one of another brand. Wiltons should be ashamed to put thier name on such junk."
2,Broke after one use,"I loved this thing the first time I used it. However, the second time I tried to decorate with it, the thumb piece broke! This gadget is a neat idea, but it's not made to last. Looks like other reviewers had the same problem."
2,Works well when plastic parts don't break,"I really like this decorator. Only problem is the thumb lever breaks rather easily if your mixture is a slight bit thick. (Normal consistency) Also, the small tip adapter breaks for the same reason. Why not make these parts out of steel?"
4,Works as promised,"This item worked well for me, although the thumb press seems a bit flimsy and will probably be the first thing to break. I've only used it once but so far, so good."
4,Grace Jones for a new millenium!,I have only heard one track off of this album (Lately) but it is enough to make me buy the whole thing. This band is thought provoking while making you want to slam yourself against a brick wall. Her song delivery goes between nails on a chalk board and the cool rush of the waves. The effect is totally unbalancing but you want more and more!
3,average cheap bdu shorts,"I brought propper pants and was blown away, they were such high quality, with poly blends, snap closures. I had to have more propper, so i bought their shirt, which was horrifyingly large, and then these shorts.Back when I was a teenager I'd wear cheap BDU knockoff shorts and pants all the time. It was all the same, button fly, cotton, the crotch would wear out if you tried to run in them. Well this is that, with a zipper fly as the only improvement.The fly is zipper with one big residual button. The material is 100% cotton. It won't breathe. The crotch will wear out if you try to run in them. It feels like wearing a wet rag.After ordering propper pants, I want the same in shorts. I want poly-cotton blend, i want durable and breathable. Snaps over buttons. Elastic waistbands. Snap pockets. This ain't that."
5,Beautiful and informative,Ohio Archaeology is a splendid overview of Ohio's native American cultures and sites. Beautifully illustrated and photographed (including photo's of assembled artifacts) it deserves a place in any collection of materials on the subject.One of the best acquisitions I've made this year.
5,"Anyone interested in Ohio history, needs this book in their collection!!","""Ohio Archaeology: An Illustrated Chronicle of Ohio's Ancient Americans..."" is a fantastic book. I have known bits and pieces about Ohio's ancient history, but I wanted to know more. I joined the Archaeological Institute of America, and through them, learned about this book. It is far more than I could have hoped! I have learned so much from Lepper's book. We are so blessed to have some of the world's most incredible ancient sites right here in Ohio. Now that I've learned more, thanks to this book in particular, I want to visit as many of these sites as I can, and when I do, these places will have so much more meaning. I strongly recommend this book to all Ohioans and anyone interested in studying Archaic, Lower Woodlands, Middle Woodlands, and Upper Woodlands peoples who once lived exactly where we live now!!"
4,"A good collection of their ""comeback"" hits","In 1975, I purchased the single `Walk This Way."" It along with the radio play of `Dream On' and `Sweet Emotion' is the only exposure I had to Aerosmith for the next 15 years. Having caught them live with KISS last month, I was most impressed with their stage presence and collectively how tight they were as a band. (Unfortunately, I can not make the same positive comment about KISS.) Regardless, I wanted to get a hold of some of their music while eagerly awaiting their new ""blues"" album. I decided to purchase a ""greatest hits"" cd of their comeback music rather than purchase all their studio recordings since 1985. Young lust has provided me with all the aerosmith songs I've heard on the radio for the past 15 years. Plus, I have a couple of live oldies that remind me of what a good performance I witnessed. Now, I need to get pandora's box and then (for the casual Aerosmith fan), I'll be sitting pretty."
2,TRASHDONTPICKITUP,"Okay,maybe that was a bit harsh,but I liked the first three albums just fine.The redone versions of some of them just aren t as good as the Originals.And disc three is completely dispensible.Next time stick with what you know and let YOUR music do the talking.That s all I have to say about that.."
3,It is ok,I think a best hits CD would have been better.SDI didnt much care for the early stuff.But it is a good CD.
4,Only Aerosmith,Pandora's box collects from the greatest Aerosmith. The songs that are etched in my brain like a Dremel to a thick piece of soft metal. I disagree with including the Beatles Butchery.
4,Godzilla: New and improved,Godzilla makes a triumphant return to the big screen. This movie isn't a sequel to Godzilla vs Destroyer. It is a sequel to Godzilla:King of the Monsters(1954). Special effects wise this movie is the best in terms of a Godzilla movie with several scenes being the best in Godzilla's screen career. They do succeed in bringing Godzilla closer to the quality of the new Gamera Films. I really enjoyed this movie and having seen both the Japanese and American Versions of this film.(Not Deanzilla). The American Version of Godzilla 2000 is Superior. The Japanese Version moves along slowly in places with long peiods of silence. The American version inserted new music and sound effects into these places aw well as incorporating Godzilla's theme into the Final battle and closing credits. This is a top notch Godzilla film and I can't wait for the next one!
2,"""bad language""","this movie would have been great if it weren't for the swares. i rated it 2 stars for the ""sware free"" scenes with godzilla and i would have put in ""5"" but i think swearing shouldn't be in any movie. in the ""a-ok"" scenes godzilla looks more like a dinosaur & gets a new color for his fire! and he rampages on! until some guys from the ""crisis control intellegence"" (cci.) find a strange rock underwater which they decide to take to the suface.and it surfaces itself!!!!! (after the help of some baloons.) and on the surface it ""follows"" the sun.and then it starts flying! because it's really an alien spaceship.and tries to defeat godzilla! and then later godzilla surfaces and attacks the ship! and when godzilla's stuck in rubble (momentarily) the alien comes out.but he sure isn't small.because he's actually another monster from space!it's name......orga.godzilla rises and it starts!and i can't tell the rest.(if you rent/buy it just fast forward to the end!)"
1,Awful and Wonderful,"This movie stinks in the wonderful way all Godzilla movies stink.Godzilla 2000 is awful and wonderful with a meaner looking Godzilla but the same dumb-as-nails humans. Needless to say, the Japanese try everything to kill Godzilla again this time and nothing works...again.Why do they keep shooting at him when he is impervious to pain? I thought the Japanese were smart? In this movie two characters, father and daughter, seem to like Godzilla who destroys a heck of a lot of the city and kills thousands of humans. Somehow or other we are supposed to identify with the ugly beast.In this movie Godzilla fights a giant rock from outer space that turns into a spaceship then into a monster and then Godzilla...well I don't want to ruin the ending.One star: BUT a lot of idiotic fun!Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
2,Godzilla looks corny again!,"Even though he looks a little more realistic here than in the previous Japanese films he still is too much a man in the monster suit. And he walks upright again! It was discovered by scientists, less than 40 years ago, that dinosaurs like tyrannosaurus rex didn't walk upright In the 1998 TriStar film he moved much more realistically and looked more terrifying. The cornball and again upright appearance of Big G in the 2000 film threatens the credibility of the movie. I like the film better when he isn't in it."
1,Godzilla,This movie was just as stupid and cheesey as the Godzilla movies made 25 years ago. The Japanese producers of this film must not know much about what acting skill or dialoge is. The voices they use to dubb in from Japanese to English need alot of coaching. Overall this show belongs in a freak show and please dont buy a ticket to it. John Klein
1,Holy ...,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS 0 STARS I WOULD. FIRST OF ALL, THE SPECIAL EFFECT ARE HORRIBLE!! Now i don't care what they say about how they have to be models, iT LOOKS LIKE ITS FROM THE 60's. THis movie [is unacceptable], acting is horrible, i don't know how it diddn't go straight to video. IF you are a DIE HARD godzilla fan you MIGHT enjoy this. Otherwise it [is unacceptable]."
5,Huge fan,I have every one released in the u.s. I grew up watching it as a kid and my kids enjoy him also.
3,Godzilla with no subs?,Well its Godzilla 2000. An awesome movie by itself but unfortunately this version doesnt have Japanese dialogue.So your 2 choices are either watch it dubbed in English or French...yeah French. I still enjoyed it butthe English dialogue is pretty bad.
3,fun,This movie was not bad. It brought back good memories of my childhood and the fact that I watched it with my son was great.
3,not my favorite G-film...,"Although I have a number of problems with this particular film, the DVD is of decent quality. It's in 5.1 audio, with behind the scenes, production notes and the American trailer for the film. However, this is still the American cut with its God awful dubbing, so overall this will make a nice edition to your collection but still not among my favorites."
3,Good & Campy,"The title sums it up. Watching Godzilla's rampage through modern Japan is an exercise in smile-inducing fun. This is a good-natured movie that is what it is, no pretensions, no false advertising."
3,Godzilla,"This movie is okay. I did not like, The monster he fought. The scenes were realistic. Best Godzilla in 40 yrs. The Suit [disappointed]."
3,Just a note and a small review,THIS DVD DOES NOT HAVE ANY JAPANESE AUDIO TRACKS. JUST DUBBED. If you want this film in original Japanese DO NOT order this version. Other than that the film was good. Just what you expect from an Amercanized (dubbed) Godzilla film The only problem with this film is the horrible dubbing done by Tri-Star and the fact that a whole 12 min of film was cut out.
4,NOW THAT'S GODZILLA!!!,"GREAT!!! EXCELLENT!!! OUTSTANDING!!! Okay, I'm overeacting, but this movie stands out from past Godzilla movies. The new look was great and the CGI shots were a nice touch (A first for Godzilla movies). The movie was good but not the best. I do hope they make the future Godzilla movies better. Still a great movie to watch. This was a review from yours truly, DC."
3,Japanese Language,"If you are a die-hard Godzilla fan, then you will probably need this DVD for your collection. I have loved Godzilla since I was a child, however, I bought this DVD because I buy just about everything that I can on DVD that is in Japanese to practice my speaking and listening ability. Unfortunately, and contradictory to what it says above, there is no BONUS Japanese Language version on these disks, at least not on mine. You are stuck with the English dubbed or even more ridiculously French dubbed version of the movie. So if you are buying this disk so you don't have to watch the dubbed version, then you are wasting your money."
4,Godzilla 2000,"At last, a real Godzilla film. Much better than the 1998 junk that came out. It's worth buying just to see the new Godzilla suit."
3,Not The Best Godzilla Movie,"While this movie is a step up from Godzilla Tokyo SOS, it is still not as good as Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla II or Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. Let's face it, most of us watch these movies to see Godzilla stomp on Tokyo and for the great monster battle scenes. Unfortunately that seems to be lacking in this movie. Godzilla battles a UFO that shots plant vines or something at him and at some point turns into an Alien. But the battles are not that good and they take place about an hour into the movie. There just aren't that many good visuals in this movie and there is a lot of BAAAAD CGI work that looks like it was done on somebody's home computer. So for these reasons I give it 3 stars."
2,Oh so much promise....,This movie was a real let down. The characters were weak and cartoon like and the plot got really stupid. I found myself wondering why I was wasting my time watching this movie and not cutting my toenails or something.
4,Godzilla is back with a vengence!,"It's been five years since the release of Godzilla vs. Destroyer and Godzilla is back better than ever. A sleek new look, the use of both puppets and 3-d graphics, and a menacing monster foe makes this godzilla movie one of the best in the series. If you didnt see it in theaters, pick up a copy now."
4,A better effort in the series,"You know what you're getting with Godzilla, and while there are unintentionally funny moments in this film, by and large it's better than most of the series. As you explore our giant nuclear dinosaur friend's oeuvre, this should be one of your first stops, along with Godzilla 1985 and of course the original 1954 Burr-less film."
4,Godzillla's Back for revenge on Gino,"Gino, the american Godzilla......I WILL NOT DESCRIBE HOW HORRIBLE TRISTARE'S REMAKE WAS, but will give this a review instead. I will tell you the Good things first #1 A lot of good effects are done #2 It was realesed in America (Yah!) and although americanized, it is still good. #3 Great monster battle. #4 interesting plot, it is fast paced and is always getting to the point. #5 Good Dubbing, yes you heard right, good dubbing. (Although critics under rate it.) Bad things, 1 and only, some cgi was bad, oh well it's not like people are int he streets yelling how bad the cgi was. Bottom line is that this is a response to the American Godzilla, and they make a great movie that I will treasure for a long time."
5,Excellent!,Just got this dvd from Amazon today and watched it. Video and audio quality are very good and I would highy recommend this DVD to any one.
3,"Not bad, but not good...............................","This is not your common Godzilla movie. For one the suit is design in not a good way. The neck is too fat, and the fins are too long. In this film Godzilla fights a monster called Orga. Orga only appear in the end of the film. But the film does move along pretty well for the most part. Better then GMK, but not better then Final Wars which is the far best Godzilla movie."
4,so so transfer - great commentary,"Godzilla 2000 is really ment to be seen on the big screen. All the glaring bad effects and campiness is forgiven when his royal grumpiness is stomping on small cars. On the home side it loses something. That cinematic feel. That popcorn in your lap and hooting and laughing at lines such as ""did you see that flying rock?"" All is not lost on this DVD though. The commentary track really stands out and gives you some deep insight into editing and post production process and voice acting. They speak with such passion of the series that it at times elevates Godzilla to High Camp Art. If you are not a fan of the genre or have no sense humor pass this film by otherwise go buy it now!"
5,"He's lean, he's green, and he's back!","The big guy's back and better than ever! We all know that the Godzilla likes to destroy Tokyo, but when it comes to monsters, now were talking! I think this one is even better than Destroyah or Spacegodzilla( but NOT Mechagodzilla 2!)I especially think the begining is the best! But, hey, we all have our ipinions! You take a plot, put in the G man, add a monster, and watch Godzilla do some but kicking and wham! Toho does it again! The movie also has a little chain to it= spaceship= rock= spaceship= spaceship and monster= monster= dust.Well, I hope you enjoy this awesome movie! ( from 1# Godzilla fan)"
5,The REAL Godzilla returns with a vengence!!,"After many years-and a failed Americanized attempt-Godzilla is back and better than ever. A new and improved Godzilla suddenly awakens and wreaks some havok, but why? The answer: a giant UFO has been unearthed from the bottom of the sea and is hell-bent on destroying earth by stealing Godzilla's power to regenerate. Godzilla won't have none of that happening and confronts the alien in an all out, action packed, and one of the best Godzilla fights in recent memory. The dialogue this time out is rather good and the human story is acutally good. Fans of ""Rubber-zilla"" will be pleased, as this is one of the best Godzilla films since the original. If this kind of tempo keeps up, the two new Godzilla films slated to come out this year and next should be awsome."
3,Americans don't respect the big G,"Every time a TOHO Godzilla film is released in North America, the big studios butcher the heck out of it. It happened with the first Godzilla film, it happened with Godzilla 1985(return of Godzilla in Japan) and again it happened here. This movie was sliced and diced. Sony cut 9 minutes of footage, added dialogue here and there and changed the soundtrack. How can they do that and call it the same movie... If you want to see this movie the way it was meant, go on ebay and buy the Japanese version DVD with the english subtitles, it'll cost you about [$] but its much better."
2,blowback to the original,"This movie is somewhat a nostalgic trip. It looks like it was filmed for the same budget as the old Godzilla movies. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, the plot is barely there. But then the plot always was Godzilla gets up and tears up Japan. The problem is that this isn't the 50s, 60s, or 70s. The nostalgia isn't enough to carry you through this film. No, the revamped Godzilla wasn't any good, nor is this throwback. Your best bet is to go and get the original movies.At least Mothra wasn't in this one."
1,This is far worst Gozilla movie,"I am a Gozilla fan. I own almost all the Gozilla dvds. This one is the worst. Gozilla doesn't even move other than Roaring still. It is a ""dead"" Gozilla."
3,Big G is Back !,"Godzilla is Back in his newest Movie.Now w/ new special effects this Movie is REAL monster movie,unlike other Godzilla movies he's not ALL good. This Movie is a TRUE Godzilla Movie!"
3,Almost Perfect,"I saw this movie in the theater with my friends and loved it. One of my favorite parts was the finale where the main characters explain how godzilla is a great guy, followed by him destroying the remainder of the city, freeze frame. ""THE END"" and a spinning ""?"". It was great! I never laughed so hard. I buy the movie and skip to that part, and for some reason, they removed the spinning question mark from ""THE END"". Why? If not for that, I'd have given this DVD 5 stars."
5,Kwanzaa Keeper,I liked this book to help understand this holiday from a families' perspective. The text and illustrations are great to really connect with how and why Kwanzaa is celebrated.
2,"Suede trying to reach a ""suede-sound"".","As a long time Suede fan I have to advice you not to take this record seriously. ""Eletricity"" is a recreation of Suede's hits (as ""Trash"") with weird noises and lots of echos, in attempt to make it sound experimental. Basicaly, it seems that Suede is now a band influenced by Suede, trying to do a Suede sound that sounds thin. The lyrics are ridiculously a repetion of the same Suede subjects. In respect for what they've done in the past (especially at the Butler years) I'll skip comenting the b-sides. Buy the first two albums,or even ""Sci-Fi Lullabies"", that's what Suede's really about."
3,"Fez 1954, a descriptive narrative of troubled times,","This novel was not a page turner for me as it largely focussed on Fez at the time(1954) of the Moroccan people uprising against the French. The narrative was told from the perspective of a late 30's American man, John Stenman and an illiterate non political 15 year old Moslem boy, Amar. Amar apart, the characters were rather bland and the novel read more like a lengthy! 400 page essay on the troubled times. Interestingly Bowles chose not to have any French characters apart from walk on roles, policeman, hotel manager etc. Much of the discussion in the book had Stenman reflecting on how the Moroccan people would not go back to their traditional way of life but embrace a more European lifestyle. A book for Fez lovers who want to read an historical perspective."
3,The Deana Carter Collection,"I bought this CD mainly for the song You Still Shake Me. I remembered she had released this song back in early-mid 1999 and I loved it then but it basically went nowhere on the charts and radio stopped playing it after, like, a couple of weeks. And whenever I've requested the song, none of the DJs remember it. So I was really stoked when I found out that You Still Shake Me was on The Deana Carter Collection. This is basically Deana's greatest hits. There are twelve songs, half of which I know to be hits. The other six I've never heard of. There is Strawberry Wine, We Danced Anyway, Did I Shave My Legs For This, Absence Of The Heart, and How Do I Get There. I would give this four stars but half of the songs are useless so... It's still worth buying for Deana's incredible hits, though."
2,Utterly bland,"The only reason I am giving this CD 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the first three songs: ""Strawberry Wine"", ""We Danced"", and ""Did I Shave My Legs For This?"". The rest of the songs were completely forgettable, and they all sound the same. Deana's singing is listless and boring, and the music lives by the motto ""less is more"". I listened to around 5 songs after the excellent first three, then turned it off before I was bored to death. This lame CD, combined with the idiotic commercial for Carter's new CMT reality show, makes me certain that I will not be buying anything from her again."
2,Cash Cow,"There is no denying the talent of Deana Carter. That being said this collection is unnessesary and rather silly to have. Deana only recorded two albums on Capitol, her multi platinum debut DID I SHAVE MY LEGS FOR THIS? and her sophomore slump (undeservingly) EVERYTHINGS GONNA BE ALRIGHT. That takes up 9 tracks, and three bonus unreleased tracks. It's a shame her second album did not take off, its roots in folk and unique choices in material made it a winner, unfortunately people turned its shoulder on it. But she should bounce back, with her new album due later this year. This was nothing but a cash cow for Capitol to make more money off of her great music."
3,Money...,"Right.The first review asks ""How can you have a collection if you only have two CDs out?"" That's a good question. The answer is money.No, not the artist...Deana Carter left Capitol Records, so now they're putting out a CD of mostly previously released tracks and a few unreleased tracks to try and get any last amount of money they can manage out of Deana Carter.I'm giving it 3 of 5 stars because what's here is good. The older stuff is good, and the new tracks are good. It's just disappointing there is such a lack of new material from a great artist. I hope Deana has better luck with a new label and can get a completely new album out to us soon."
4,Good product,"I wanted this to help me to lose weight while I am exercising. If you want to lose weight with this, you have to excercise with it. Don't expect this item to make you lose weight by just wearing it to work or watching TV. It doesn't work like that. As a plus, it gives me GREAT back support that I need to lift weights. You will sweat, so be prepared to deal with it."
1,Not recommended,"Not a good product in my view, I wouldn't recommend it. The Super Waist Toner is a better product, get it if you need a toner belt"
1,HA ?,"You got to be kidding right ~!?? If you are an Intelligent Human Being, use common sense please ~! LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget! LOL ~!!! You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out, plus eat good. PERIOD. Gee, I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers !! can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things ~! LMAO~!!! People are cute~!!"
2,False advertising,"The ad for this product says that it is 1/4"" think. That is NOT true; the one I received is only 1/8th inch thick. Had I know that, I would not have purchased it.The good news is that it is 9"" wide, while others are only 8"" wide."
4,Excellent review of current research/issues at the time..,Research and issues related to cognition in young children are reviewed/presented well.Contains rich information about young children's understandings and misunderstandings and the importanceof understanding the influence of any specific approach to studying the topic.
4,Recommended for Collectors,"This set was a lot of fun to construct, but it is less durable than I had anticipated. The hinged ""roof"" must be carefully balanced in order to open and close properly. And, once constructed, it really has no use other than display. It is far too brittle to be a children's toy, but is a nice addition to a serious Star Wars collection."
3,"Cool Ship, But LEGO should have planned better.","I was very excited when I got this in the mail. It took me 4 hrs (with breaks) to completely build. Then when I finished, it. I noticed that the base floors are very weak. They are made of 7 big flat pieces and held together by thick bricks. When building the sides (where the pod and platform that doesn't work) and the center, you notice the weakness. What I suggest is buying one of the Creator sets and using all of the thick bricks to sturdy the bottom. Do this before you build the top because otherwise it all falls apart and becomes a huge pain in the butt. Other than that, this set is great. The only other thing I dont like is that they have Han and Leia in the skin tone colors."
5,Best LEGO ever!,"I got this lego 3 days ago and thought, after reading several reviews, that it wouldn't be fun. I was wrong. I don't really get why people call it such a bad lego. It did break alot when i built it, but when it is done, it is great!It is hard to get Chewie and Han in the cockpit, but that's about the only bad thing! I think this is a really good buy!"
4,Millenium Falcon,"The Millenium Falcon is a fairly good set. It includes a cool escape pod that can easily detach from the set. The set has a movable roof, so you dont have to take the roof of to see inside. My favorite bit is the gun turret (it only has one, on the top ,a minifigure fits inside. It also includes a laser gun for the snowtrooper to try to destroy the ship ,just like in the 5th movie. It would be better if it included more minifigures , like Luke and R2-D2. It has many features from the movie, making it realistic. The landing gear fall off if you are not careful. The inside off the ship is cool, and you can fit a lot of minifigures inside. It is a major improvment from the first Millenium Falcon set. I think it is quite cheap when compared to its value. I would buy this set if you are a LEGO fan."
4,Fun if its Stable,"Well at first when I finished this lego as soon as I picked it upit broke. I build it again it broke. I rebuild it and I left it on the chair. Someone sat on it. I didn't build it again and left it alone for a long time. In that time it haunted me so I put it under the bed. I saw another lego I wanted and I decided to fix this lego before I orded it. it never broke again. It comes with Han Solo, Princess Liea, Chewy, and C3PO. It also comes with a snowtrooper with a tripod gun"
3,Millenium Stress Maker,"Hi,I am 7 years old. This was pretty easy to put together, but VERY hard to keep together. It breaks if I try to pick it up even if I'm being really careful. I think I will glue this stinkin' thing!"
3,Punching Comfort.,"Overall this is a pretty good frame. It really does hold your material tight. But the carding strips are really sharp and cut your fingers and forearms really easy. I have figured out a solution for this. Take a bath hand towel and cut a hole in center just big enough that your patterned piece shows, then you can rest your arm on it to punch.It helps quite a bit and the extra ends of the towel you can double it on the side your working on for added coverage. Happy Punching! Its addictive!"
3,"This frame is NOT 10 x 10""!","I even wrote Jo-Anne before ordering this and asked if it was really the 10 x 10"" model . . . IT IS NOT!!! It is the smaller model, working area is about 6 x 6"". I think it is a good product, but the information is incorrect."
5,very well written,I love Colin Harrison's work. I put him right up there with Michael Connelly and Lee Child. He needs to write more books!
5,Best Seller List,"The book ""Angels In The Mist"" was written by one of our Artists, and unknown by us she has as much talent in writing as she does singing. This book is a must for Adults with children, as well as adults alike. It should be on the ""Best Seller List"" by fall if it was up to us."
2,Thin,This thing reminds me of those rubber Jar openers the kind you hold in your hand .This is not a utility mat.Its a utility napkin at best.
3,OK Mats,"Wish they were thicker and bigger. They also slide around too easy because they have no ""nubbys"" on the bottom. But, they look cool and they work OK."
4,"Yep, it's a floor mat.","What you see in the pic is exactly what you get. Just a small mat for the back. So if you want em, get em"
3,A glimpse at the history of Rancho Los Cerritos,"This is an interesting brief history of the Rancho Los Cerritos. Going through the native Americans to the Bixby family, Engstrand tells the story of how the area has changed hands and what activities occurred there.Certainly not a greatly detailed account, but a quick read for the curious."
2,new software won't run,"With only 64 mgs. of ram this computer will not fully load the new Windows XP. There is no information on video, sound and expandability on the system. When I buy a computer it is a 4-5 year purchase and I upgrade as the marketplace moves.If I were to buy this product I would be taking a real chance as to weather I would need to immediately spend more money to upgrade just to stay current with the present market."
5,Seth is the Best!,"I love this Book - can't put it down. The book is an easy reader, however, very deep in thought. It opens your mind to a new way to look at the world, and not as we typically know it. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a desire to know what is ""On the Other Side"" of this planet and the entire universe. This is a must read for anyone interested in the truth and in the paranormal. Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down."
4,"Good, but not perfect.","I have always loved this album. I remember when it first came out, and I got addicted to ""The Audience Is Listening"". The only downfall is a couple of the tracks have you thinking okay is this just album filler or what? Been a guitarist I do look at them as very creative songs, but then viewing them as a casual listener's point of veiw it gets you wondering on a couple of the tracks."
4,Passion & Warfare,"I'm a fan of the great guitar players...Yngwie, Eddie, Stevens, Frehley, Shepherd, Satriani, Slash, Ray Vaughan, Page, Di Meola.If you're on board with any of these guys, you'll be fine with this CD.Vai has a style all his own, and it works for me.If you're wondering who provided most of the guitar work for the ""Bill & Ted"" movies,and some other movies, it's this guy.Enjoy !JP"
4,Passion and Warfare,"Great piece of work. I have heard it is one of his best, now I believe it. Very diverse piece of work.Better than I expected. Very likely to purchase more of Steve's work. Like the disc very much and wouldn't hesitate to recomend it to somone else."
5,best guitar album EVER,"this is the greatest guitar album ever and YES that includes the hendrix stuff. (who may i add is very overrated). it's a great culmination of a decade that pushed the limits of guitar. but this album isn't a metal album, nor is it a blues album. it's a guitar album with a wide range of effects and sounds that are radiant to the ears. songs like erotic nightmares, animals, and the audience is listening are great fairly straight forward rock masterpieces that have that steve vai touch. the instrumental (though they all are) for the love of god is one of the greatest guitar solos EVER. any guitar connoisseur owes it to theirself to check this one out and you'll be amazed that there was work like this that you didn't know about. i HIGHLY recommend this one for any fan of metal, blues, psychedelic, jazz, or simply put the GUITAR. GET IT NOW!!!"
3,Has its moments,"There are actually some pretty good tracks on this album. The problem is that even the good tunes are way too long and contain the infamous super-shreds that tear down even the best compositional effort. Even the incredible bass player Stu Hamm can't help that the music often degrades into long slews of self-indulgent guitar-noodlings.The one true saver on this album is the track 'Sisters', on which Mr. Vai lays down some pretty melodies ... on a *non*-distorted electric guitar, nontheless. Some passages are even reminiscent of Joe Pass (!), which is quite a compliment. This track alone saves the album from the utmost 2 stars it would normally deserve."
5,Vai-gra...=),"Steve Vai is viagra for the guitarist...trust me, this album is incredible! From the amazing Liberty, with those quintiplets pickings, to ""For the Love of God"" with a beautiful feeling to ""Sisters"" with a gorgeous tone and feeling, this album kicks MAJOR ASS =)...buy it."
3,"good, but not steve morse","this is a good album for aspiring guitar players, but if you want to go the extra level and be a truly great and unique guitarist, listen to steve morse. vai is a good player, a berklee graduate, and the frank zappa influence is evident, but later in the album he ends up sounding too much like satriani meets jason becker. some complicated guitar stuff but not nearly as good or as difficult as steve morse stuff. if you want to hear the greatest guitar song listen to 'tumeni notes'"
3,hands up !!,"Excellent album. Espescially the song calledthe audiance is listening. Little Steve Vai is talking via his guitar to his teacher. It is his real teacher, who he tracked down for this cd. And whom's voice do we hear when we hear ""no, I'm very very shy""?Great guitar work. He should join Van Halen !"
3,Great guitar player BUT........the album sounds like he,"Steve, made the album in one take. Granted the guy is great guitarist. The cd is hard to follow in regards to form, it has little. An excellent demostration of tricks via tremolo, harmonics, tapping, ect. It is apparant (To me ) that his best works is when its colaberated with others: Sheehan, Roth, ect. ""Eat 'em up and smile"" had to work with a singer/band, it just wasn't mass guitar effects and monster solo. (Not as thats bad, as a guitarist I live for the solo) an extensive solo that accompanies an entire album is hard to listen to.Mike"
1,An album of sounds not music,"Being a huge Satriani fan for nearly 20 years I've often wondered what Steve Vai would be like. I heard he's got incredible technique and that this is the album to listen to if you want to appreciate him and as luck would have it I found it in the bargain bin and thought ""what's there to lose"". Well it turns out that it's a load of rubbish which explains why it's in the bargain bin. The album is basically a collection of Vai trying to imitate birds, speaking, water and all sorts of crap on his guitar. Very technical and very unmusical. To top it off there's all this supposedly deep and meaningful rubbish spoken over the top of the ""songs"". Are you joking? I hope like anything that other Vai albums are better than this but this one is so bad I wouldn't risk spending anymore money on any of his other albums just in case."
2,"Unoriginal ""look at how good I am"" guitar album.","Theres nothing original or great about this album. I heard about it from a friend who play classical & neoclassical guitar, so I decided to give it a listen. I didnt think there was anything original about it, hearing the same regurgitated heavy metal solo gets boring after a while. Definetly NOT one of Yngwie Malmsteens peers."
5,Best of all times,"Great songs,incredible guitar playing,beautiful album cover and wonderful concept.Passion and Warfare is the best instrumental rock album of all times."
3,A few great songs - but most are pointless wanking,"""For the Love of God"" is a nice piece of music. But most of this album is rubbish. Sorry, it's true. Generic rhythm tracks overlaid with endless, childish ""dweedly dweedly dweedly"". It's great musicianship, and there are some good ideas here which might have gone towards making better songs, but overall it's terrible music. Just because you *can* play it doesn't mean you should. As another reviewer wrote, this is why shred is dead. If you like this sort of thing, check out John Petrucci's solo album instead... it is light years ahead of this in compositional maturity."
2,Disappointed...,"Just received this football. It does not look at all like the picture. Plain black and red with a tiny Falcons logo on one side. It was going to be a present from Santa, but I think I'll return it to his shop. :-("
1,Got the wrong football....TWICE!!,"In the pictures, the falcons football was a really cool, detailed football, but i ended up getting a very plain football like the ravens one in the picture.so i returned it, ordered it again, hoping after talking to the people at amazon i would recieve the correct one, but no, got the same one."
1,Not worth it!,When I ordered these I thought they were the same brand that I usually get but they are not! They don't cut well and the mechanism that makes them ultra-thin makes them difficult to use. Don't waste your money. I recommend the Dovo Flat Nail Clipper.
1,Complete Garbage,"I have a zwilling collection at home, kitchen knives, utensils etc. and love every piece. So i was shocked to discover how bad this clipper actually was. Both my wife and I tried to cut our nails with it, and it was not powerful enough to cut. I have returned the clipper and am trading it for the cheaper model with the plastic collection tray. DO NOT BUY THIS. It is truly a case of form over function."
5,Well Loved Book,"We purchased this book for our oldest over 9 years ago. It was immediately her favorite book...we would read it over and over again. When our son was born we pulled it out and he loved it just as much as his sister. Between the two of them, the book was loved to pieces. Today I bought a new Very First Words for our youngest...it's that good.This book provides basic vocabulary with engaging illustrations that appeal to very young children (and parents too). At the end there is even a page for counting practice. The board pages enable the children to look at the pictures on their own and provide the durability that is needed in a well loved book. The quality of the manufacturing is excellent."
3,Medevial Doings,"If you like this historical era, this is a fine read. On occasion perhaps modern sensabilities applied, but entertaining enough that I read both of the related books by this author."
4,i like this series,prioress elanore and brother thomas make a great pair even if they don't know it. i suppose there were some forward thinking people back then...
5,Ttyrant of the Mind: A Medieval Mystery,"I am restating my review for this book because it says it all. You will not be disappointed if you select this or any of her books for a good read.Priscilla Royal is a mistress of the Medieval Mysteries much in the style of Mary Stewart. Her research, skill in weaving fact and fiction is intriguing and exciting. This genre is not easy to read without becoming bored with stale descriptions and two dimensional scene settings; however, Ms. Royal pulls it off. Ms Royal's skills in bringing about the various stages of the novel and building toward an exciting plot and conclusion are worth the read. She has two other novels that are also on the Amazon list and I have read them all. I look forward to more of her clever plots in future books...and I do sincerely hope there are many more.I will also review her other books in the same manner as they are equally delightful stages of her trilogy."
2,Juvenile,"This mystery might have been written for a junior high school girl, except for the number of times the word ""rape"" was included. The same conversations were repeated over and over. Skip this one!"
5,Excellent reading!,Priscilla Royal writes an historically authentic thriller every time. Her plots twist and turn and she never fails to perplex the reader as the plot unfolds. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
2,Back to Methuselah,"BACK TO METHUSELAH is not on the best seller list for Bernard Shaw because of its length and its theme. The book has an extremely long introduction by Shaw which is quite revealing about his attitudes toward Darwin, religion, society and other things. The play has had very few performances, obviously, because of its length. It is of interest to a reader for its anti religious views, and its premise that living longer does not equate increase in intelligence or even in sensitivity to the needs of others. It is a very pessimistic and fatalistic work. ""Che sera sera"" no matter what humans do or do not do."
5,"Tradtional tunes, well performed","I wanted a good CD of Israeli folk tunes. I picked the song ""Dror Yikra"" more or less at random as my sample, then listened to basically every recording of that song in the Amazon inventory. This CD, ""Israeli Songs"", stood out. I was looking for traditional melody, well performed, with minimal embellishment (showy vocals, live audience, etc). This CD delivers. The rest of the tracks are equally good."
4,"Good Sound, New Way","Overall very good sound and comfortable to wear.This is a new type, the sound can be heard by others, as it has a flow through speaker. Our mind set is that headphones are for single listening, the others in the room can hear as well. Though not loud, but they can make out what one is played through the head phone."
5,Aural dessert,"These headphones are like being in a warm waterfall of sound. I listen mostly to jazz and classical and you hear the players taking breaths while blowing their horns. If there are better sounding headphones, I'm not interested because after years with my 580s they still send me and never disappoint. They create a precise, gorgeous aural world that you can just drift away in."
3,Do not drop,"These cans sound great for the money and are very comfortable. Just beware, do not allow them to drop on the floor!! The sides pop off and the drivers fall out and it's really difficult to re-inserted them correctly so they don't buzz.Of course that point is moot, if they are no longer available."
4,Best headphones for the price,"I use these headphones to listen to my vinyl album collection and they produce a consistently impressive range. I have used lower-end Sennheiser headphones in the past, and this model was a pleasantly unexpected jump in sound quality. The only thing I have found a little lacking is the amount of external noise they allow to get through, but this is a minimal deficiency compared to the audio quality they transfer. Highly recommended."
5,Amazing,"The highs are detailed without being harsh, the lows are articulated, tight and smooth. You will be amazed what you can hear in your music that you could not before. A word of warning, however. MP3's encoded below about 192 will sound flat. There will be a lot of detail, however relative to a CD the sound with be noticably lacking. Also, these headphones are extremely comfortable. You may need to stretch the headband out a bit so that the cans aren't putting too much pressure on the top of your jaw, but that is an easy fix.In short, highly recommended."
5,HD580,"These headphones are great especially considering the price. I've had mine for a year and after all of the use/abuse they are still working without any problems, another reviewer had problems with the connector but I have not experienced that. Most of the parts that get worn are replaceable so I expect to get a lot more use out of these headphones."
4,It was a great book.,"I really enjoyed reading Mr. Patterson's book. Being a young Oriole's fan, it shared with me the glory of the past days in Baltimore as well as the downfalls. The one thing that bothered me about the book was the pictures. The majority of them were autographed and that took away from their point in my opinion. Also, the captions on the pictures usually told about things that would happen a few pages ahead. This would tell you prematurly about what was going to happen."
5,"Excellent condition, quick response!!","The book was in great shape and I received it in approximately 3 days. I would definitely use and recommend this seller! It was bought for my son, as a replacement for a book that had been chewed by a puppy many years ago. It was put in a closet and forgotten. Was happily surprised to find it on Amazon after so many years. My son was thrilled!"
5,great,"I'm a college student and I'm glad that I got this book, I've been in classes that have attacked the Christian faith. The author avoids Christian cliches, and tells it like it is. He uses humor, gives the facts, and great advice, it'll help the college student as their challenged in the real world. A must for any Christian in college."
1,Hire Christian Staff,"I think the key to keeping a campus Christian is to hire Christian staff. This book did not address this. In fact, it is illegal to hire only Christian staff, to ask if an applicant is Christian, etc. Another problem is that 'College' is a mechanism to allow students to grow and learn. This is stifled at a Chrisitan College. I find more judgement, more close-mindedness, less acceptance of others on a Christian campus than on secular campuses. Christian campuses tend to address the sins that they feel are BIG (premarital sex, homosexuality), while commonplace sins are overlooked (overeating, judgementalness, etc.). The book did not touch on such judgement at all. It needs more chapters and a more global approach..."
4,KEEPING YOUR FAITH,"I think this book is well written and composed. It gives Christian a good understanding of what they should expect from their professors and how they as Christians should respond. Keeping your faith in college is harder than it ever has been before, and this book points out thoes facts plain and simple. It also gives practical advice and knowledge for the student who is either struggling, or may be soon. The casual format of writing helps keep the reader attentive and allert to the points that the author is making. The book overall was enjoyable, interactive, and insightful. It would really help a young Christian who plans on leaving for collage any time soon."
1,No. Just No.,"Before I read this book, I was a Christian with doubts who was about to go off to college. After I read this book, I was an atheist.Here's the gist of the advice given in the book:First, remember that your religion won't be taken seriously in college, and don't be disheartened by that fact. Second, never consider the possibility that there's a reason you won't be taken seriously. Third, do not engage in any sinful activities (shouldn't this be a given for Christians anyway?). Fourth, don't take criticism of Christianity seriously because that could endanger your eternal soul. So basically, you need to close your eyes, put your fingers in your ears, and say ""lalalalala can't hear you; lalalalala can't hear you"" whenever anyone questions your faith.My verdict is that if you want to stay a Christian in college, and you have doubts about your faith, don't read this book because it will make your doubts even stronger. There is no good advice and no real philosophical content in this book."
3,clean does not equal raw,"I listened to every tune, and I feel like the effort was worthy, but the elements that brought the music together were too clean. The songs are squeaky clean, every note is in its place, and the singer is too contrived for my liking. I think most of my problem with this disc is the singer, trying to be like Robert Plant, rather than singing the songs, not with Robert's rawness, but with his own, and it didnt happen, ever. I believe if you try too hard on something, the majic of it gets lost in the translation. The reason I give it a 3 is because musically, it was good, but it was too tight without much room to breathe, but vocally it sucked because the singer was so bent on trying to be Robert Plant, it was like tracing over his picture and calling it himself. I feel like Jasons earlier albums had more virtuosity and feel to them than this one- but I wouldnt blame this one on Jason entirely."
3,a nice copy of zep,Bonham does a great job. The singer tries a little too hard at times to be a Plant clone. Good listening.
4,Great for a bicycle tool bag!,"I use this in my saddle bag for longer rides. Fits perfectly and works great! The ratcheting system seems really sturdy, and the nickel finish is quite attractive. This is a perfect on-the-road tool for anyone riding a bicycle requiring 15mm axle bolts (bmx, track, etc)."
4,After the Fox,"1966 - Screenplay by Neil Simon, directed by Vittorio De Sica (The Bicycle Thief), starring Peter Sellers and Victor Mature.In the first ten minutes, the Pink Panther formula is laid out, just waiting for Blake Edwards to come take it. It even has animation during the opening credits, with music by Burt Bacharach. Peter Sellers is the master thief rather than the bungling detective, the Fox is Italian, and there is no Cato in the cupboard. Otherwise, I can't think of a thing in the Pink Panther franchise that I didn't see here.Victor Mature was excellent as an over-the-hill actor clinging to the delusion of youth. This is an overdone stock character, right? Not with the right actor. (No, I'm not thinking about William Shatner. Really.) Otherwise, Sellers carried this movie on his shoulders and he did it well."
5,Do you need a good laugh soon?,"...If so, and you like Peter Sellers, you'll enjoy this film. It is so wacky and so 60's! Peter Sellers is so cool in this film! It's my second favorite Peter Sellers film, next to ""Lolita."" Victor Mature in a comedy role? Yes, and he's great. Don't forget to buy the CD soundtrack for this film. Those Burt Bacharach tunes are wonderful."
5,A hillarious movie,"This is a classic Peter sellers film. Personally, I think it's the best of all his movies. Every time you watch it you see or hear something new.When he cries out in anguish ""Arrgh...If only I could steal enough to become an honest man!""When he promises his crying mother that he will take care of her and buy her a new house with shiny pots and pans, and she replies, sobbing...""I don't want pots and pans...I want Grandchildren""The aging Victor Mature exclaiming indignantly, ""I still have the pupils of a young boy""Some of the lines and background scenes you catch the first time...Some you won't catch until the 4th time you watch it.The music to this film is by Burt Bacharach and is filled with tunes that stay with you long after the movie is done. The landing of the gold and the Italian Police are just 2 of the tunes that set the stage for the action.Buy it, make some popcorn, and sit down to a funny movie you can watch over and over again. And watch for a cameo by Vittorio Di Sica."
5,I have never seen a Funnier Film!!!!!!,I remember first discovering this film on a friend's video by accident and so i watched it...and by the end of the week i'd watched it about 5 or 6 times! i couldn't put the film away... just had to keep on seeing it! i've been trying for years to get a copy on video - now i've found it and shall order it post haste! victor mature was perfect throughout ..but Peter Sellers (one of my all time faves - especially thanks to the Goon show!!) excelled himself! I'll never forget the way he impersonated a yank at the party he crashed! wah wah wah !!! so true!! would have given it 6stars but amazon are were a little short!!!
5,Our Family's Cult Classic,"If you haven't been to Italy you won't 'get' this film. If you have, you'll agree this is the best of Sellers and Simon. Stellar contributions by Mature, Balsam and Eckland. Gags are a weird combo of obvious and intellectual. For 20 years our whole family's favorite."
2,Not much fun,"I bought this film cheaply from a local store. It is very noisy film. People are running a lot and Sellers is making faces and jumping. That is not funny at all. It is also supposed to be a parody of film-making, but it is a very old hat. When one impovises and does not focus ones film that makes it a new wave film, the writers and Vittorio de Sica seem to be thinking. Shame on you, Vittorio! I give one star to Victor Mature who is great as old, egomanic film star. There is a car chase in the end, but it is among smoke clouds and one cannot see anything. That is funny, of course. Thus this is one-star film with a star added to Mature."
4,great record,"Really nice songs in a country rock vein. Some tunes have a little more edge somewhat like Matthew Sweet.Good mix from mellow to uptempo rockers. Well produced and performed. Great followup to ""Bonvista"". Too bad US doesn't have a clue. Much like Blue Rodeo, Kim remains a Canadian secret.One of the better CDs I have bought this year."
1,don't bother,"not very tasty, had a very odd smell not bisque like to us. Sent the rest of the cans off to a shelter."
2,Where's the meat?,"Not good,not bad. Not worth the price. I used it as a base and added a can of shrimp for some flavor."
2,Not as expected.,"I have eaten restaurant quality bisque and this is not it. You can see the bits of minced crab, but the batch I received had no flavor. I added spices and a generous splash of half and half which improved it somewhat. I canceled my subscribe and save subscription. I also read the reviews for their other products and seems one either loves them or doesn't. Ending on a positive note, their label is made w/ certified green paper and vegetable inks and the cans are made from recycled steel which I thought was impressive."
1,not good,My friend and I all bought this products. It tastes not very good. We will not buy again. Bar Harbor Crab Bisque
3,very mild,"This sauce is easy to make, but very mild (even weak) compared to other Noh sauces. I guess this is OK if you are looking for a subtle teriyaki flavor that doesn't smother your meat's natural flavor (like most American BBQ sauces do)."
2,look's like VietCong handywork to me,"If you want to lose some fingers or other essential parts of your body ,I suggest to write Mr Ragnar Benson how this FEELS!!."
5,Good Book,"This book as been around for a long time, for it has a lot of great historical facts and present day gun making from CIA to street gangs. Ranging from carbine copy guns, to home-made pipe pistols."
1,"should say ""rip-off"" in title",it was mostly the rambling of the author stroking his own ego than anything of actual information for my liking.I hated even giving it one star!
2,Not pleased,"Installed the Sony CDX GT-310 in my daughter's car and it worked for about 1 year. Now it displays a ""FM1 Failure"" and the tuner only supplies static. The CD player still works fine and to give Sony some credit the unit does sound pretty good. I contacted Sony via website ""chat"" and after wasting about 30 minutes troubleshooting the unit with the ""analyst"", she told me the unit required repair. She sent me to the repair website and I discovered the $79 exchange program. Like someone else here said, you can buy a new one cheaper than that and who knows how long the process would take. I'm not sure yet whether I'll replace it with the same model (so I don't have the expense of purchasing a new wiring harness/adapter) and risk another failure or, replace it with something else. Either way, I'm not happy with this product."
3,Beware,"Contrary to the ""Technical Details"" description, this radio CAN NOT use Sony's iPod adapterSony XA 110IP - Car headunit adapter. The radio itself is fine but I purchased the iPod adapter at the same time based on the technical details description only to find out it will not work. The company I pruchased the adapter from did take it back but I lost the cost of shipping both ways!"
1,Did not get all of the parts,Jack of all trades master of none did not send the connecting plug. They say I can use the one in the car.. I wanted to indtall it in a 1967 pick up. I will not do business with thme again.
1,Died after 15 months,"Installed this unit, which was manufactured 12/06, in my Wife's car in June 08. Died Sept 09 just after the 1 year warranty ran out. It won't make a sound...won't accept a CD...but all the lights are on. I checked all the connections and they look fine. Apparently this isn't unusual for this unit, from other reports I ready. Beware. Sony offers only one warranty repair, a $79 exchange for a refurd, which includes shipping. Too bad for Sony that I can buy an new radio from another manufacturer for the same price! Not the first quality issue I have had with Sony's quality over the past ten years. Sony...you and I are definitely through."
5,Stops Sugar Cravings,"I ordered these in order to help my non-alcohol related fatty liver disease. To my surprise, they also stopped my cravings for sugar! Some research showed me why this happens, but it was a nice bonus for me."
1,"Great crackers, but expire within a few weeks of order","I love these crackers, but how am I supposed to eat 12 boxes in 3 months? I expected more than a 3 month expiration date -- they must be shipping old stock."
5,sacth is god,"joe satriani is by far the best guitar player in the world as a soloist . He is the greatest fountain of inspiration for today's guitarists. His godlike command of his instrument and composition ability has launched another masterpiece for electric guitar .All songs are absolutely excellent but bells of lal,forgotten and flying in a blue dream are my favourite ones .Also big bad moon is my another favourite song with vocals and strong musical basement . This album is a must for every life form in the universe.BUY OR DE!"
2,Bland-esque,"Typical electric soloist set of mediocre compositions expanded upon with the occasional gut-wrenching guitar flights of fancy. Besides for a few conscious attempts at instrumental inspiration, it is a fairly formulaic and dated production, where withered riffs belie technical prowess. Wish there could have been more atmospheric stuff truer to what thematic opening and closing songs suggested."
3,My Advice to You,Step #1: Buy Mystical Potato Groove Thing and Flying in a Blue Dream off of iTunes.#2: use hymn.net to tear the 'apple' lock off of the file.#3: use a commonly available converter to turn the file into mp3 (or sometype of file).#4: add those two songs to your playlist and move on with your life.
4,Highly Underrated Album,"First of all, I just need to say that Joe Satriani is one of, if not the best rock guitarist out there. Nobody else can play guitar phrases like he can, and nobody writes intrumentals like he does. The album has so many great songs, including one which everyone overlooks. The last masterpiece at the tail end of the cd called Into The Light is my favorite song on the cd. The first time I heard it, the song gave me chills. There is an element of power and awe that is screaming from the mood of the song, and its too bad that its only a little over 2 minutes long. I listen to this song at least three times before I take it out of my cd player.Joe Satriani is probably one of the most talented musicians in rock music, and with only the likes of Eddie Van Halen and Eric Johnson rivaling him, I firmly believe he is the best. Nobody else can write an instrumental with a much power and outward feeling as Satch can. Buy this album, and own a masterpiece.Cheers!"
5,AAHH,"I like this.Sensitivity and creativity still not seen really.Unusual riffs in ""The Mystical Potato Head Groove Thing"" and sensitiviity par none in ""Flying In A Blue Dream"";Funk par with none in ""Strange"",""Big Bad Moon"" is really a chunka rock song,""Ride"" is Great,and ""The Bells Of LAll (Part one)"" (Freakin Buddhist feeling..)really takes me away.."
3,"Not Satriani's best, but still good","If you're not familiar with Satriani, this is definitely not a good place to start. It is good, but it has some glaring problems. Most obviously, Joe tries to sing on a few tracks. He may be a brilliant guitarist, but he should keep his mouth shut when he plays. Still, the album has some good compositions that redeem it. My favorite piece is the self titled opening track. During one of the times when I saw him play, he opened with this song, which immediately set up a mystical atmosphere for the performance. If you're a fan of Satriani, then this is definitely worth checking out. If you aren't familair with his music yet, check out Surfing, Crystal Planet, or Strange Beautiful Music first."
3,Certainly has its moments.,"FLYING IN A BLUE DREAM is a good album. Not great, but good. Some of Joe's best work is on display here, specifically the great title track and ""Back To Shalla-Bal"" -one of the best songs in Joe's catalogue. The rest ranges from good to forgettable and pedestrian. In the interest of good taste I suggest that Joe not sing anymore as he does on some of these songs. Worth picking up if you find it used, or if a good restrospective of Joe's career ever comes out (we can always hope)."
1,Gerber's fruits are cooked,"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies; when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?"
1,Be warned: this has tuna oil in it that is not organic.,"When you get this home and read the ingredients list, you will see: This product has ""organic"" stamped all over it, but when you read the ingredients list, it includes tuna oil that is not organic. I called the company, and they said the product ""does not have harmful levels of mercury."" I prefer my bananas with NO mercury, thanks. They include tuna oil to provide a source of DHA, but there are several baby products that have plant-based sources of DHA. We are vegetarian, and I don't want to feed fish oil to my baby. I recommend other brands like Earth's Best which seem to be more careful about their ingredients. I'm sure this is fine for people who are feeding tuna fish to their babies anyway, but we don't plan to give ours tuna fish."
4,Much better game!,"Much better control, graphics, sound music, storyline, just buy it!!!!!!!!I reccomend it to flight simulation star wars fans!!"
2,Poor Simulation and Gameplay,"This game should have been called ""Jedi Gun Turret"" because that's what it simulates. There is no sensation of flying at all and the inaccurate physics of the game become really annoying. Also, the graphics may be good for a PS2 game but they're only passable on the X-Box.I found this game a huge disapointment. I would strongly recommend that anyone thinking of buying it, rent it first. (In fact, I even wanted my [money] back after renting it)"
2,Boring.,"Average graphics, slow gameplay, insanely shallow dialogue, and cheesy music. Need I say more?"
1,Hard on System Resources,"I was expecing a more sophisticated Rogue Squadron, but was disappointed in this game. Graphics are fine, but all-in-all RS was much a much better game.Technically the game is tough on resources. It's not on the box, but once you buy it, you're instructed in the manual to press CNTRL-ALT-DEL and end all running programs except those required for the system. (Disabling them won't do the website says.) My game won't work on my XP partition at all. It gets into a weird loop at the options menu and just goes wild.On my 98 partition, it runs, but freezes and stutters, requiring a reboot. Since no one's going to give your money back, buy this at your own risk. And don't say you weren't warned!This game definately isn't ready for prime time. And even if it were, it would only get three stars."
3,Jedi fighter is it worthy,The game is short and the fx could be better.I mean you get good weapons and ships and can unlock bonus ships but the game is short the grafics could be better but it is a fun game to play.It also has a co op feature wich is fun.You only get to fly 2 types of ships untill you unluck certain things to fly others in the game.If you are a serious starwars gamer be my guest and get it but if your looking for a longer game or one with supeb grafics you should keep looking.
5,"correction to reader review titled ""psychotic masterpiece""--","Quick correction to several misstatements in previous reader review titled ""psychotic masterpiece"": 1. Hiss was guilty. See book titled ""Venona,"" by Haynes and Klehr. 2. Chambers was an editor for Time magazine, not Life. 3. Chambers was neither pychotic nor delusional, but a lucid and intelligent man whose testimony is well documented. See corroborating biography of Chambers by Sam Tanenhaus; and ""Perjury"" by Allan Weinstein --neither book written by right-wing idealogues."
5,For all time,"In every age, there are people who experience life at the fulcrum. The bend and turn of history cross the arc of their lives. Frequently, because they are able and talented, these central people are capable of more than just historical action; they are capable of understanding and recording their experience in the larger context of the era. Whittaker Chambers is a man whose experience is inseparable from the 20th century. One thousand years from now, if books are read, Whittaker Chambers' WITNESS will be an account that matters. The account of what? The account of an idea, hopefully forgotten, which historians will call the Communist error. In that error, millions of men and women are forever entombed. In WITNESS, nothing is entombed. The force of life, the force of liberty, the eternal growth of honesty and understanding live. Is WITNESS perhaps wrought and overstuffed? Oh hell yeah. This is literature."
5,one of the greats,"it's terrifying to think that hundreds of communist traitors had already infiltrated our government by the 1930's. scary stuff. you will get a great spy story, and a great trial drama in this book and i can't recommend it enough. never vote democrat again as long as you live."
5,The Best Autobiography I've Ever Read,"This reads like a great spy novel, but (of course) it is true. After one has finished the last page there is a feeling of loss ... where are giants like Chambers these days?"
1,Waste of time,Chambers is not a conservative. He is a collectivist who switched from an atheist collectivist philosophy to a mystical Christian collectivist philosophy. He has done more damage to the philosophies of the right than any socialist could hope. If you want to read something by a real conservative read Ayn Rand. If you are reading Chambers you might as well read Marx. At the core they are the same.
1,"Critical Views of ""Witness""","""A Long Work of Fiction"" is the title of the review of ""Witness"" by Nixon's Watergate defense attorney Charles Alan Wright, an eminent constitutional scholar who believed Alger Hiss innocent. (Saturday Review of Literature, May 24, 1952)""Just from a literary point of view, it is ghastly twaddle -- huge stretches of overwritten, self-important, desperately self-inflating swill."" Such was ""Witness"" to the columnist Molly Ivins. (The Salt Lake Tribune, Nov. 22, 1966)..."
1,Whittaker Chambers is not a Conservative,"Whittaker Chambers may have left the Communist Party, but all he did was remake his collectivist delusions around something else. He is about as far away from Ron Reagan as you can get. If you read Chambers you might as well read Stalin because there isn't a lot of difference between their thinking."
1,Once a Traitor . . . .,"Chambers confuses the ideals of communism with the practices of Lenin during the consolidation of the revolution and the internal holocaust of Stalin -- As usual conservatives simplify the complexities of an intellectual philosophy based on socialist ideals seduced by a Soviet propaganda machine that exceeded in its scope even that of Goebbels -- Chambers largely ignores the phenomenon of an American Nazi movement fomented by 'ends justifies means' rationalizations by such notable Americans as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joe McCarthy, & retired Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who betrayed his most trusted aide, Gen. Marshall, in his quest for the 1952 Republican Presidential nomination. The chief reason Chambers is promoted by the representatives of the capitalist class & their minions is the threat socialist ideas pose to vested interests in opposition to the natural rights of man expressed by Tom Paine."
3,"Witness, by Whitaker Chambers","I like the book very well, but I find the lack of page numbers on Kindle distracting. Also, I would like to be able to refer back to the table of contents from time to time."
3,overlong,"This was one of those books that it seemed like everybody had read except me, so I finally got around to it. I was not disappointed: it's a fairly engrossing tale from a man whose name should be synonymous with courage.The effectiveness of his memoirs, however, was blunted by the following:1. Did it really need to be so long?2. It was disorganized. For example, the first section was basically a bunch of name-dropping before you'd gotten your sea-legs -- did Chambers really need to put this section first?3. Way too many topical references. This may have been fine in the 50's, but 60 years on, many of these names don't ring a bell. And this is going to get even worse with time. It's only a matter of time before this book has to be issued with footnotes or something. In this respect, Chamber's book is a bit like the Inferno: the raw power of his narrative is often weakened by so many now obscure names and events."
2,"Sure it has Austin Powers, but the game plays horribly.","There is only redeeming quality to this game: it feautures Austin Powers. Everything else about the game is a waste of time. First of all, the graphics are stone-age. The actual gameplay borders on sad. A constantly shifting camera makes it hard to even see where the ball is most of the times. Even at this bargain price, you won't play this game for very long, simply due to all its flaws. If you are dying for an Austin Powers game, try the ones on Game Boy Color. Everyone else is better off saving their money and just rewatching the movies."
1,OLD TECHNOLOGY,Save your money and buy a game that is newer and has better graphics. This game is outdated and not much fun to boot.
4,Fashionable well Made Boots,nice boots. Well made. Not as comfortable as I thought for all day shopping or long walks due to the height of the heels.
2,Cute style but....,This style was really cute and looked great on however they smelled awful right out of the box!! It smelled like mothballs so unfortunately I had to send them back..very disappointed.
3,Grossed Me Out,"I enjoyed much of the ride here. Dark humor was very much in evidence and the movie was rolling along with that weird ""Pusher"" momentum. It got more than a little grotesque at the end though, without much point I think, and left a bad taste in this viewer's mouth. Which made it my least favorite of this trilogy."
2,Satriani unsaturated,"2 1/2With some decent production, the rock guitar expert manages to breathe a somewhat gritty integrity into a small amount of the blues-rock shredding, excelling of course on a few off-ramp melodic explorations which take him outside the predictable path of merely soloing, if amazingly, over bland riffs. But in the end this album is predictably crushed by an inordinate amount of predictability- simply too much of it sounds too bland in retrospect."
5,Absolutely my favorite guitar album period.,"Wow. I bought this album about a year ago, and it remains my absolute favorite guitar album, bar none. It must have stayed in my 5-disc CD player for like three months, and it has lingered nearby ever since. I love that guitar takes center stage and you don't get tired of the album due to the lyrics, because there arn't any! There are numerous songs that could be singles here, and only a few of the songs, and only a few songs that I don't get excited about. Most of the songs are high energy and overwhelmingly succeed at showcasing Satriani's mastery of the guitar, and musicality within the most, ah. . .extreme musical context. As of yet, I have not found another high-energy electic guitar album that remotely approaches this one as an album."
3,Just your 'average' Joe.,"Satch is great-I've seen him live, but this disc is just average. Sure, everyone knows ""Summer Song"" from those 1992 SONY commercials, and ""Cryin'"" and ""Tears In the Rain"" are both beautiful and haunting. But the rest is pretty run-of-the-mill as far as Joe goes. Good, not great. For a first purchase go for ""Surfin' With the Alien""."
3,Title of the CD is so Appropriate,"To be honest, what was at first 'love' has turned out to be only lust, which is to say that I never listen to this CD anymore.Yes, it's an amazing virtuostic display of production and 6-string prowess; tracks #1,2,3,4... ok, all of them are amazing. But it just doesn't draw from the heart, it is lacking in substance, and that will leave it at the bottom of your CD stack in time.I guess you could say that it's like non-alcoholic beer; ok it tastes like beer, but it's. just. not. very. satisfying.Everybody should hear it, but perhaps not everyone should buy it. I recommend the self titled album, Time Machine, Surfing, Crystal Planet, and Strange Beautiful Music instead."
2,Plastic and heartless,"This album is a complete sold-out by Satriani. I prefer ""Flyign in A Blue Dream"" and ""Surfing With The ALien""."
2,Music perfect for tv commercials or guitar maniacs,"Satriani is surely a great guitarist.his technic skills and abbility to play very easy even the most dificult chords and solos is amazing.but the music...is for me to simple.tracks are perfect as background music or something like that.just instrumental rock songs.vocal would give it much more colours.i mean,listen to ""Friends"" or any other track.if you are not a guitar fan you will be bored after 2 minutes (or less).if you are even a guitar fan you will propably like it.i didn't.to me satriani could have done it so much better.i believe because many of his other albums are simply stunning.while ""Extremist"" is of course his classic album it is in my opinion much overated.maybe you will click in this moment on ""this review was not helpfull for me"" but the true is i never liked it as much as Satriani other instrumental albums such as his debut."
5,Play That Geeetar Son!!!,I love all of Joe's stuff. The Boy can just flat out play that thing. He shreds for sure but his compositions are first rate. It's always about the song. I've always found that the music evokes the title of the song. Joe is a musical genious. You can't go wrong with any of his stuff in my opinion.
4,A little better than Surfing with the alien,i really like this one. So many greats. Fast forward to the solo in New Blues and you will be blown away
3,ABZ of Relativity,"I think this book can justifiably be called ABZ of relativity. The author sincerely tries to tell us about relativity by building up from basic elements, but at the point it gets to the stuff that is supposed be really interesting, it becomes unintelligible for the less gifted. He gives three pages to tell us about the difference between mass and weight, but the central concept of ""interval"" is used for some pages before being poorly defined and explained. I am positively sure he understands relativity and all, and I am sure those definitions are correct in the strictest sense, however they didn't help a beginner, at least in this case. Having said this though, this book is still a very nice read and could be read even if only for its strange humor and wisecracks."
5,Brody is our little darling,"My granddaughter LOVES her Brody. He soft, and cuddly, and his expression is so life-like, he seem real. Lot of personality in his moosh."
5,Simply Amazing,"I've had very good experiences with Altec Lansing in the past with a 2.0 system sitting in my room. I wanted another speaker set with a subwoofer, so I got these 2100 ones. These certainly didn't disappoint. I really like the clarity and quality of the sound. As for the subwoofer, as a mostly classical/jazz listener, I turn my subwoofer level down so it still is manageable. While listening to rock and such, the subwoofer certainly does its job. The only minor quip I have is not knowing the volume level when you use the remote as all there is on the remote are volume and power buttons. Nevertheless, I definitely recommend these speakers as Altec Lansing steps up again with another set of excellent speakers."
4,Easy Setup,"Easy Setup, clear sound, works well with my console also. No problems with the units. Happy with my purchase!"
5,Loved it for my Desktop,"I have been looking for a set of speakers like this one. Hooked up with ease and listening to iTune from the internet is a blast. Subwoofer a bit too large but I find a good spot underneath the computer desk. Satellite speakers looks cool and the seperate volumn adjust is very convenient. If you don't need surround sound, this is a good choice. I got (...)and a free set of earphone. Good deal!"
5,great,"Bought them hooked them up. I use mp3 format for all media(music) at 320 kb recorded to my hardrive. better than windows media at 192kb. i use real player ( the free one ) with 3 band EQ lot better than windows player and EQ. more treble great bass, real loud.My sister heard em got her a pair too for x-mas 03.great speakers.just depends on player and format of recording. just wanted to give you guy's another player to try em on to show you they jam."
5,"stop searching, get these!","i looked for the best 4.1 speaker system for around $100 and these are them! the sub is very powerful, and total wattage is 140. blows away your stock speakers. the satilites are surprisingly small, only 2""x2""x8"". they provide all the highs and a majority of the mids. the sub does its job well for deep clear bass. the speaker cords are plenty long to position those speakers all around. the remote is also a great touch with several options avaliable right where you want it. a definite solidly built system by altec lansing."
4,Very good value for price,"I recently purchased these speakers, and while not the top of line speakers Altec Lansing makes, These are good quality 2.1 amplified speakers for someone who wants good sound yet has space restrictions. Definitely worth buying,and easy to install."
5,"Forget all the rest, Altec Lansing is the best!","I recieved the 5 speaker set (4100) today and I love them! Many of the other reviews mention the lack of rotary volume and the fact that you must adjust the bass on the back of the sub - well this IS NOT TRUE!! I REPEAT NOT TRUE!! At least on my brand new 4100 set the volume, bass, and treble are all rotary controlled from the desktop control module! This was my only apprehension in buying the set, and now finding the rotary control on the 4100 my happiness is complete! So if you are thinking about some new speakers, get the 5 speaker set Altec lansing 4100! Top quality!"
5,great system,"I bought the Altec Lansing 4100 speakers for christmas this year and have loved them ever since. The 4 satilte spekers are small and powerful and fill my room with sond. The subwoffer is extremly powerful and shakes the house when on half power. I love the speaker, but my parents and neighbors don't. They were easy to set up too. Each speaker has a color coded wire that matches with the plugs on the back of th sub so it is very easy to put together. Please note that the gaming mode will not work unless you have a gaming sound card. But you can get use out of all four speakers if you use stereox2 mode."
5,The speaker system is great,"I bought the Altec Lansing 4100 speakers for christmas this year and have loved them ever since.

Please note that the gaming mode will not work unless you have a gaming sound card. But you can get use out of all four speakers if you use stereox2 mode."
2,"Look great, sound marginal.","I put these side by side with the Altec ATP3s, and there was no comparison. The 2100s cost twice as much and sounded half as good.At the volume level I use in my office, the highs on the 2100s were very flat and the sub was muffled.I'm still looking for the best solution, but the 2100s were not it.(although they look great!)"
2,Pretty disappointing,"I bought these speakers, and although the sub sounds good, the satellites give off a very tiny sound. It may be OK for games, but if you like to listen to music on your PC these are NOT the speakers to get.Secondly, they output very loud static whether they are plugged to the sound card or not. Altec Lansing tech support is of no help. One rep told me to exchange them because they were probably defective (which I did, and it made no difference), and another rep told me it was normal. I think all 2100 will exhibit this phenomenon, and if you work in a silent environment it is VERY annoying.I got instead the Altec Lansing 621 for 30$ more. They also give some heavy static, but at least they sound much better."
3,Decent speakers that could be designed a little better...,"i bought these speakers so my dad would have some better speakers to listen to his music when he is surfing the internet... it works out well for him because he does not need the speakers to be on every time the computer on... as for me i would not be able to use these speakers because it requires you to turn them off and on every time the power gets yanked... also, on the remote, there is no guage for the volume button, basically you don't know how loud the speakers are running just by looking at the knob/buttons... but i bought it for the price and not the conveinence..."
2,"Anything, but not reggae","After the band leader ""Ras Bernardo"" goes out, the band turn in a pop band with some commercial reggae song.This CD is a good example.If you want REAL ROOTS REGGAE, check ""Negro no poder"" from Cidade Negra or ""Campo de Batalha"" from Edson Gomes...."
5,GREAT STUFF - Dokken are BACK!!!!,"This is so fantastic - I liked there last couple of efforts, but thought their beter days were behind them. Not so! This is probably one of their best releases, and I would rate it with Tooth and Nail, and Back for the Attack. Don's voice is incredibly like ten years ago, hitting the higher notes for the first time in awhile. The songs are top notch, and the guitar playing extremely fast and melodic. Glad to have George Lynch out of the band, he can now pursue his crappy Rap music he wants to do. If anyone wants to know, his new album is called Smoke This, and is nothing but a hardcore Rap album - SERIOUSLY. Don't but that crap. This one though, is the best hard rock release since Bruce Dickinson's - Accident of Birth. GET IT!!! Great job guys......"
4,Dokken??? Still alive???,"I didn't even no Dokken was still around. I picked ""Erase the Slate"" up mainly because I was looking for a good rock album hopin it would be like ""Under Lock and Key"". This one is just a tad heavier and a little less catchy. ""Under Lock and Key"" had the perfect blend of heavy and melodic. It was just a good album. ""Erase the Slate"" does have it's moments. Like the title song, Maddest Hatter, Who Believes, Crazy Mary..., Haunted Lullabye, and My fav....In you honor. If your looking for a good rock/metal album with a little bit of ballad. This is a good choice. It just needs a little time with me."
3,Not as good as the older albums,"Erase the Slate is much better than the odd sounding, disappointing Shadow Life, but not as good as Dokken's old albums like Back for the Attack. The songs just sound flat to me--they don't catch in my head, even after several plays through the full album. The only two tracks worth repeating are Voice of the Soul and In Your Honor. Pity . . . I've already shelved the CD."
3,"Decent,but a bit of a lackluster.","Without George Lynch Dokken have moved on and quite successfully.This new record captures them retaining a lot of their musical power',however,1995's'Dysfunctional'was a much more interesting album."
3,"Why ""One""?","I love metal and I like most of what Dokken has done in the past. This CD to me does not break new ground for the group. They are still useing the same old tired ways that they have been doing for years!!! Also, what is up with the cover of the song ""One?"" They did very little to make this song their own. I think the original would blow this version out of the water. Why not cover ""One"" by Metallica if you must do a one song?!"
2,The Tinman CD?,"This cd has good production, the songs seem well blended, the playing is more than adequate it just has no purpose. Lyrically the songs are just a bunch of mishmash, in fact the only song with any true passion is the one the drummer sings! (And that says a lot)When you entitle a cd 'Erase the Slate' it seems to scream new beginning instead this screams sad ending. Reb fits and all the pieces are in place... except someone forgot to include the heart."
5,Better and better.....,"Something about Dokken's music that just won't get out of my head and Erase the Slate continues that trend. Excellent CD and Don's velvet & silk voice is seductive as ever. Frankly I'm amazed the guy can still sing after all those years of chain smoking. But I'm not complaining, at least not until he loses his voice due to smoking. Enough already, Erase the Slate is awesome and I kept listening to ""Voice of the Soul"" over and over and over again - can't get it out of my head. Don's lyrics seem to get more and more complex over the years, which makes it harder to do a sing-a-along at their concerts. Reb Beach is a great addition/replacement while Jeff is real tight on the bass. I tend to be more of a fan of bass playing than guitars so I will always appreciate Jeff. Great job guys! So, when is the next CD coming out? I can't waaaaiiiitttttt!"
4,nice surprise,THIS IS THE WAY DON DOKKEN AND THE BOYS SHOULD SOUND.THEY WERE STARTING TO SOUND VERY SOFT WITH GEORGE LYNCH BUT WITH THIS RELEASE AND THE ADDITION OF FORMER WINGER GUITAR PLAYER REB BEACH THIS IS ONE OF THERE BEST CD`S YET.CHECK THE FIRST SONG ERASE THE SLATE.GREAT GUITAR WORK.MAYBE DOKKEN HAS ERASED THE SLATE OF BAD CD`S WITH THIS GREAT CD.
2,This cd has already been filed away.,"Darn. Dokken is one of my favorite bands of all time and yet I can only give them 2 stars. I'd love to give them more but this cd doesn't deserve it. I do love the cover of ""One"" though. I liked ""Shadowlife"" and ""Dysfunctional"" better, not to mention the Dokken classics."
2,Where Has The Classic Dokken Gone???,"Dokken was my favorite band in my high school days.When they broke up i was very upset. Now they have tried to make comebacks. The problem is Dokken is not staying true to what got them near the top of the 80's rock heap. Erase the Slate has some of there best music in years, but the lyrics are horrible. Reb Beach's guitar playing is awsome, but the lyrics are bad. Dokken needs to return to writing lyrics like IN MY DREAMS, Heaven Sent, and Alone Again. Not one song on this new album is like those at all. I wish Dokken would stop trying to be a band they are not and return to the music that everyone remembers them for. The last time i saw them in concert, nobody wanted to hear any new stuff, the loudest the crowd got was when they played the classic good stuff. I would like to hear the Dokken that made a great album called Back For The Attack...Please Come Back!!!!!!!"
2,Old Dokken - NOT!,"I bought this album on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon. Oh boy, this CD in my opinion is diffently not Dokken back again. I love ""Back For The Attack"" and the CD's before it but the the vocals and melodies on this CD are just far to girly to the point of annoyance. That is the main problem with this album pure and simple."
2,Not happening,"I'm an old Dokken fan from the '80s and I have to say that the band has not recovered since breaking up a decade ago. Beach's style just doesn't fit in with that unique Dokken sound. There are a few rockin' tunes, but for the most part this CD stinks. I can't even make it through the whole thing in one sitting without turning it off. If you're a new Dokken fan, check out Back for the Attack and Beast from the East. God bless"
1,What is this?!,"I've been a fan and supporter of Dokken since Breaking The Chains. Are you people on drugs?!This album is absolutely horrible! It's got Velveta written all over it. Dokken's sound is defined by George's guitar and Don's vocals. Albums like Tooth and Nail and Under Lock and Key rocked!! That chemistry is nowhere to be found on this album. Mick Mars sounds better than Winger boy on this slab of cheese.Erase the full price and chalk this one up for the bargain bin! Without George, the band's sound lacks any real emotion."
2,a reviewer from massachusetts,"i gave this cd 2 stars because,i gave george of the jungle lynch mob 1 this is better thn smokethis ,but not really origional.just look at don dickenson,and reb ill hold up the stage coach & you fetch the money beach and how he tries to copy what was a great guitarist george lynch,and what about the lyricks,(i change myself most every day but you dont reply,how can we survive)-shattered-'im feeling empty inside'? perhaps the would be happy touring with the goo goo dolls.after this,on live from the sun they did the same dokken songs over again,into the fire etc. for the fourth time,on a dokken cd not countig the origionals,and reb really butchered lynches work.that was the follow up to this,and raise the slate was better than that,but not much 2 years later,and still no new songs.2 wrongs dont make a right,it makes no difference if there is a new lynch mob or dokken release i no longer have any interest in their music careers,''its over''."
1,Cake all over my oven too,"I wish I had read the review here before putting my Chocolate cake batter into the Rose Cake Pan then I might not have batter all over my oven too. Wish I had used my bundt cake pan --- UGH ---- now, how DO I return this useless thing??"
5,Very Good,These tapes really helped me to start off well and with the right pronunciation. Made a big difference!
4,Ty Girl Cute Candy,My grandaughter loves dolls and loves the computer so this was the perfect toy that she can use her imagination and learn as well as have a doll to hold and play with as she embraces new things on the computer.
4,An interesting oddity!,"Bob Stewart, a graduate of Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy, gave his tuba a more improvising role on this album. Lester Bowie deemed Stewart 'the man with lips of steel and nose of Spam'. Stewart uses his metallic lips to lead his small group of improvisers through a range of settings that range from the funky to strident to mellow to orchestral to New Orleans brass style, even if one of the band plays a guitar. The arrangements are superb and the soloists, including Kelvyn Bell from Defunkt, the mercurial Steve Turre and the leader all shine."
5,top 25 Praise songs,This is an excellent cd...A must to play while on your travels..Have been without it for awhile because it was broken..Life is just not the same without this daily upper..
1,Cheap,This is very cheaply made and a piece of Velcro bought from the hardware store would have been just as good. Don't waste your money.
3,Great game for kids under 9,This is a really great game for a younger gamer. The quest mode has a great story you go around the world playing diffrent teams trying to catch up with the evil brickster there is also a training mode and just single game mode to. But the bad part is I have beat teams 25-00 before in a 4 minute match. but overall it's a pretty good game.
2,TOO EASY,"This game is too easy ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP. Also, the level does not get any harder as you advance. It also does not give you much option such as off side, throwing in, Corner Kick, PK, etc. This game is too simple and too easy. It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to loose this game even you wanted to loose......Graphic are also not so great."
3,"Rock's Other Work is Hilarious, but","this is relatively tame, by comparison. Though not politically correct, Chris Rock is best when satarizing various racial stereotypes of both blacks and whites. Unfortunately, he doesn't do much of that on this DVD."
1,Inaccurate & Misleading Description,"Six old western movies and TV shorts. The only name listed in the description actually included was John Wayne. The other stars listed,Jimmy Stewart; abbott and Costello;elizabeth taylor; kirk douglas; bob hopeDo not appesr."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I am the unhappy owner of several H10's and initially there were minor problems, but the closer they got to the end of the warranty period, the more problems they started having. Problems include freezing up for no apparent reason, scrolling in Chinese, and the most irritating is when the ""system files are missing"" and you have to reinstall the firmware and redownload ALL of your music (does this alot). The company doesn't believe in customer service - you can't get through on the phone and they take days to respond to email. I have returned two because the hard drives crashed and it took 3-4 weeks to get them back, and then one of them crashed again as soon as I got all the music redownloaded and I had to return it and wait another 3 weeks. I have a problem with one that has now gone out of warranty and iRiver told me they won't touch it and to look for a repair shop online. So save yourself alot of headaches and time, not to mention money, and don't buy an H10 player."
3,Mixed Bag,"I bought this MP3 player last year to hold all my awesome punk music. I had no trouble using Windows Media Player to upload songs. The interface is easy to use and has several other features besides just being an mp3 player. My friends and I used it to record our band's music. There's tons of memory so its pretty cool. However its not perfect. Besides the record feature I've never used any of the other special non-mp3 player features. Also its diesed. My friends call it ""the brick"" because its so big. The smaller models have detachable batteries but this one doesn't which sucks because tt has to be sent back when the battery completely dies (supposedly 2 years). Once in a blue moon it freezes up but its not very often.Bottom Line: It works pretty well and serves its purpose."
1,Save your money,"This thing looks good and sounds good --- everything else about it is poor.So far I've had two (the second was a factory swap out). The second was only slightly better than the first. Battery life is short and the DC cable needed to power it in the car is not available and, (according to their official web site) won't be until October 2006. That is the top of the list then there is the issue of turning it self on without being touched. I would sell mine in a heartbeat except I would feel guilty about ripping someone else off knowing what this thing really is... My feeling is that this is a fly by night outfit... My advise is to look elsewhere for a more reliable and better engineered product."
2,Review from my experience,I dont recommend to buy this item. It is getting hung frequently and i need to wait till the battey drain to restart the system. Some times i am not able to reset the system also.I replaced this item from Amazon and even the second item is also having the issue.I am totally not satisfied with this product.
1,do not buy this product,"Sure this product worked well the first time i used it, i uploaded 1300 or so songs in a half an hour i was very impressed by it. Fast forward to the next time i try to sync music onto it. Im on day 2 of trying now and everytime i plug it into the usb port almost instantly the player freezes. The memory is about 1/4 of the way full and to say that im p.o.ed would be an understatement. Im never going to buy an iriver product again and if customer support cant provide me with an answer i will be returning this product very soon. For almost 200 dollars the quality of the product should be a little bit higher. Take pride in the products you make and dont expect the public to handle you providing faulty devices in mass quantity"
4,Almost Excellent Device,"I have found what I've expected and beyond. Iriver have excellent sound and features. When I synchronize with the computer, it organizes all of the images and music automatically. But unfortunately, when it is connected to computer it is not possible to listen to it."
3,adequate,"This divice freeses every now and then, it's not worth returning so i will just deal with it."
2,Women's Lives,There was a LOT of writing in the book. The highlighting is understandable but the doodles was a little out of control.
5,WOW!,Just got done listening to the cd and I am amazed at the vocal techniques. Miss Wheeler has such an awsome voice. This is a must have for anyone's Jazz collection.
4,A dream picture.,I loved this MOVIE! THe plots ok-the acting great(I loved the part where jolzy seemed like he was about to say the B word)- you have to love harry langton (he's in this to)-the songs- jolson's sidekick- the rhyming dialog- the girl- jolson himself- EVERYTHING!
2,"Not worthy of ""The Greatest Entertainer""",Al Jolson was certainly one of - or possibly THE greatest entertainer of all time. His performance shines in this movie. But the story and disjointed flow do not even come close to being worthy of Al Jolson. Although he does an excellent job as usual - this show does little to highlight his amazing talent. Why he would choose to star in such a movie I can only imagine.
3,"An Pleasant, Interesting Musical","This may not be Al Jolson's best movie, but this very entertaining musical is certainly his most interesting.Directed by Lewis Milestone and featuring a pleasant score by Rogers and Hart, the film casts the legendary performer as the self-proclaimed ""Mayor of Central Park,"" the happiest hobo in New York City. His life changes when he falls in love with beautiful amnesiac Madge Evans, who just happens to be the mistress of his friend, the city's playboy Mayor (Frank Morgan).What makes this film truly memorable, aside from Jolson's singing, is the script's rhyming dialogue and the character played by silent screen comedian Harry Langdon, who is consistently spouting statements that, in that Depression era, would definitely be considered ""Red"".Michael B. Druxman"
3,Harry Langdon,"We enjoyed Harry Langdon in this film, others were okay,but not great. The songs are not good.But other than that, it was Harry that made the picture, did not like Jolson.But glad this film was released."
1,"This game sucks, don't buy it!!!","In comparion to the earlier ""Spec Ops"" games of the series like ""Steath Patrol"" is this game absolutley sh**. The other games also had crappy graphics but ""Airborne Commando"" is the worst. The graphics is just like in my old Commodore 64 days and the gameplay... The earlier games had at least a so called realistic graphic and game features, this one now looks like ""Mario in War-Land""!!!I spent nights with my buddie playing ""Stealth Patrol"", because the two player feature was a great thing and in ""Airborne Commando"" is it totally missing.For all the gamers out there, when you think ""Airborne Commando"" could be a better version of ""Spec Ops"" (newer, better graphics, better gameplay), like I did... don't be disappointed, like I'm now, don't buy it. This game sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worst game in the spec ops series,"All the other spec ops games are amazing. They are challenging and fun, but this game was terrible. It is nothing like the others. It is extremely easy and really boring. You dont even have to do anything but walk around pressing the shoot button! Do not buy this game."
3,"Great, but incomplete","This a rail shooter with great graphics and music. The problem with this version is that it's incomplete - it has only 4 episodes, while the original (apparently made only for the original Nvidia 3D cards) had 7. So you finish episode 4, and are left with a feeling of incompleteness, since you never have the final showdown with the evil wizard and his dragon.I'd give it 5 stars IF it was complete."
3,No Wonder!!!,I see why the show didnt last......it was neat to see the comics at the beginnings of there careers but the show stunk!!!
5,"If you are interested in original 911s, this is a must-have!","This is one of the best books about classic Porsche 911s available. It provides detailed information and pictures of the specs (incl. interior & exterior trim, engine, available colors, option-lists and many more) of all 911 series. You want to know, which model exactly you are looking at, next time you see a classic 911? Read this book and you'll know."
4,"Good, basic intro in 911 world","The book offers nice information year by year, chassis numbers, colors, gearbox numbers, ratios, engine numbers and overall good technical info, but is generally basic. It will offer nice entry into 911 world, but don't expect to learn everything. Choose what You want instead, search and learn about model you prefer somewhre else, and this book will make it easier to say: ""this model is for me, and this is what I can expect from it"". So, it's usable and nice thing to have on your bookshelf.It doesn't say too much details. For example, it says that 911's from 65' have wooden steering wheel's, but it doesn't say what kind of wood it was made of (sorry if I haven't find that:). But at least You know which car should have wood inside.When you see what you want, search deeper somewhere else. 911's half of century is too much to describe in any book. Search else too, but it's nice to start with Peter Morgan's guide and I can say this: Great book for 911 starters like me."
4,Robes are great but...,"The clasp that came with it barely held the robes closed, and takes some time to make yourself looking like the pictured harry potter. Note that only the hood has a burgundy inner lining, the rest of the robe is just black.Other than that, the Gryffindor patch is nicely printed and the robe's material is fine for creating a rather accurate look for a student of hogwarts. For the price of 20 bucks, I would recommend this to anyone for halloween."
4,Doable,This product ultimately served the purpose I wanted it for. I liked the way it fit though if you have really long arms and legs I don't think this will suit your needs. It was a little worn out in some places but it was easy to hide. It's not an exact replica obviously but it suits the purpose of a cheap Harry Potter Halloween costume. Ultimately I was very pleased.
3,Better Gryffindor Robe on the Market!,"If you are willing to drop a Benjamin for your HP look, consider this:- A 100% authentic HP robe IS on the market- Purchase a Gryffindor Robe from the Universal Studios Online Store (from The Wizarding World of Harry Potter), and you will NOT be disappointed.THE UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ROBE:- 100% AUTHENTIC ROBE- The colors are perfect (accurately match the film with both the burgundy & gold)- The crest on the robe is perfect- The feel of the robe is lightweight, comfortable, and durable- Universal offers SEVERAL available sizes for their robes--which will fit your body accurately**Consider visiting the Universal Studios Online Store today!**"
3,Ok for halloween costume.,"This was part of my hp costume, which turned out great, however, i was disappointed in the material quality. Very thin, strings were hanging out of the stitching, and the clasp did not stay very well. Through out the day, it kept coming undone, & by the end of the day it was broken. :0( i will have to hot glue it back together. I am 5'4"" lady, and it was very long, i had to hem it 5"" t make it come just above my ankles. Overall. It served its purpose, but i just wish it was better quality."
4,A Norman Rockwell Childhood,"This pleasant biography relates episodes from Rather's childhood in the 30s and 40s. His life is shaped by his Texas heroes, river rafting like Huck Finn, selling newspapers on a Houston street corner, listening to war news on the radio and being confined for months to bed by rheumatic fever.I'm surprised that Rather didn't apply his wordsmithing to this, but worked with a co-writer. The result is not of the quality of Angela's Ashes; lacking compelling detail and life or death feelings. Still, it helps define the character building influences of a figure familiar to Americans from their daily TV news. It also gives a slice-of-life view of an era that feels like an old Saturday Evening Post cover by Norman Rockwell."
5,Real underground baby,"This is a great EP by Grave Plott. A lot of people aren't familiar with Grave Plott, but they consist of Killa C and Liquid Assasin and are signed to Tech N9ne's label Strange Music. Tech N9ne makes an awesome appearance on ""Die Again"" and I absolutely love the beat. ""Real Life"" is a great rock/rap song with Big Krizz Kalico doing an awesome hook. ""Put Da Hands Up"" is a hard hitting street anthem for their fans. This cd also features several Liquid Assasin solo songs that are great fast paced rap songs, such as ""Break Yo Head."" This is a great underground rap album and shows that Strange Music is quickly becoming a force to contend with."
1,not accurate,"This book does not describe accurately the views of the mormon church (LDS). I've read the book of mormon and it seems to support the bible, and is consistent with the bible. It witnesses about Jesus Christ."
5,Very Accurate,"This is a must have book if you know a Mormon or if Mormon come knocking at your door. It explains many Mormon beliefs, such as God was once a man and you (all men) 'can' become a god, that Jesus and Satan are really brothers, and many other 'VERY' non-Christian beliefs. This book points out that Mormonism and Christianity have very little in common."
1,Author needs to get a life.,"This book focuses more on contention than building an atmosphere of acceptance. It's sad that anybody would spend this much time and effort to tear down people who believe in any religion with false doctrine, half-truths and using scripture out of context. If you sincerely want to learn about the ""Mormon"" church, this is not the book. If you want to ridicule a group of people for their personal beliefs then I suppose this book is for you. I personally found nothing worthwhile in it. I checked it out from my library. I would not accept it if it where given to me."
5,A Good Defense,"I love this book! When I first came in contact with members of the LDS Church I was barraged with nearly every question McKeever addresses in his book. I was often confused by the nature of the questions the Mormons asked me because they seemed purposefully aimed at casting doubt on my own faith and church. Answering Mormons' Questions helped me tremendously. It not only gave me Scriptural starting points for understanding what the Bible says about some of these issues, but it also helped me understand where the questions were coming from and why they were being asked. I found this book to be primarily a defense of the historic Christian faith in response to the claims made against the Christian Church by the Mormon Church and its members. I highly recommend it!"
1,answering mMormons' qusetions,"The author starts out saying the mormon church attacks other religons I say Prove it he can not. His intolerant idea is since they beleive differntly than other christians they are attacking them, he belives by their mere existance they attack other religons. There is no book I know of published by the mormon church that in anyway attacks any other church. The author is merely a bigot and it shows."
1,How Sad...,I love Jesus Christ with all of my heart. I am from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (His name is FIRST!)and that does not mean I love Him any less. This book does not contain all of the facts and is not fair.
5,Great music for yoga,We have used this for yoga at home and it fits well for the vinyasa or flow yoga we do.
5,Kitaro's Silk Road,"Silk Road by Kitaro is an excellent CD. The music is soothing, relaxing, and delightful. He is truly a master! I hope to purchase more of his CDs."
1,"Great Music, Defective Discs","This is a reissue. I thought with the logo ""2o Bit Digitally Remastered"" that I would be getting better sound quality. And you do...except...there is a defect on the original tapes on Track Five that now also shows up on each and every disc, or so I was informed by New World Music when I wrote to them about the problem being on my original purchase and then the exchanged copy.I would like to recommend the music. But, I don't think anyone should buy a disc that has been manufactued with a known defect.(And since I can still play my old copy without having any skipping, I'm not sure about the explanation I received. My trust level has taken a serious hit here.)I would still recommend purchase of the Silk Road music, just not this issue."
1,Avoid this product.,The fan motor is not the same as the one in the photo. Also the motor is rough when turned by fingers.Poor craftsmanship.I will be returning this item and hope to get a FULL refund.
5,Great Battery,"I dont understand the difference in price of batteries for cell phones, typically my cell provider(where i buy my phones) will try and sell me another phone when i need a new battery because of the high cost of the battery($34.00 in this case). Then i find this battery online and am skeptical of the quality because of cost(1/3 of cost from phone provider) but took a chance because didnt figure i was out much. Well i was wrong, unless i got lucky to get a good one, it is performing as well as the original battery did when the phone was new. I was unsure because some of the ratings show experiences not as good as mine. But i will buy another as my batteries need replacing."
3,rating cell batteries,"Slim cell Batteries seem to work well. Different voltage than OEM but only slightly off. Have only used them one month. Seems a good deal on the batteries until shipping costs are added in. Was a good deal compared to local retailers,butmore than I would normally expect to pay at an online discount (Due to the shipping costs). Shipping was $4.00 plus per battery (more than half of entire purchase. Could've bought them cheaper elsewhere."
5,Great Replacement Battery,"This battery ""fixed"" my poor V262 and brought it back to life. If you let your phone get almost dead before charging, your battery will have a longer life. Great product!!"
4,"Good Basic Overview, Not Current with Today's IP Technology","I expected the 2006 fourth edition to be more up to date with today's IP satellite technology. While the networking chapter discusses IP, it is in the contex of ATM and TDM technology with little or no information on current IP topologies and satellite Internet IP services like Hughes and BGAN among others. Additionally, there is no mention of current DVB-S or S2 technology which is widely deployed today. Roddy fails to make note of the broadcasting migration to IP with most of the broadcasting information somewhat dated."
4,An Asian who opens his life gives westerners insights.,"This is a rare, autobiographical insight into the personal experience of a Korean man as he struggles upstream in the changing cultures of Korea and America of the 20th century. I have read many Asian history books, yet rarely does a westerner have access to the personal life of an Asian, bridging life in two continents and cultures. One reads here about Joseph Ryu's upbringing in Korea, those things which remain as values to him as he flees to South Korea, seeks his education in Seoul, and moves on to America. I see America through his eyes. What an experience! His romance and marriage in America revealed deep emotions which Asians rarely speak of, particularly to westerners. I was left wanting to know even more of the world context of his life, more of his opinions at each stage, yet grateful at the opportunity to read some of the inner life of this great gentleman, and expand my understanding of life."
2,Might be fun for kids under 7,"I am writing this review because the only other review for this game so far gives it 5 stars. In my opinion, there is NO WAY this game is worth 5 stars. The reasons are as follows:1) Gameplay is VERY slow. This game is frustrating to play because the lego players move at a snail's pace during the game, and that's when they are ""running"".2) Despite the screenshots which show a bunch of different backgrounds for the matches, you can only play at 3 different ""stadiums"" until you beat certain levels in single player mode, which unlocks newer stadiums one at a time. Kind of annoying if you just want to play a friend and want more stadiums to pick from.3) There is no commentary during games, which makes the matches very quiet and dull. And the music isn't enough to make the match entertaining.4) The powerups may seem fun at first, but they grow old and are a pain to use during games.All in all, I'd give this game a 2 out of 5 because it might be fun for little kids."
5,Creative Play Puppets,"This finger puppet eyes are great to jump start dramatic play or be used to resolve conflicts in young children. Since the eyes are unisex they work for both boys and girls. Even though there is a show that uses this type eyes, the opportunity for creative dramatic play is endless. Fabric can be added to add unique distinguishing details for individual characters. The product is very durable and has withstood hours of indoor and outdoor play by all 3 of my boys. My youngest son has Asperger's Syndrome and has used these to practice and role play social skills. I have even seen my 13 year old use them to make silly jokes. I would say the product is great for all ages, because as a parent I enjoy playing with them too!"
2,12x 9.5 oz box,"Perhaps there is a real market difference in price around the country, but I've never seen that while traveling and buying Triscuits in Illinois, and going up the east and the west coast. I live in North Texas and the Kroger here regularly puts these 9.5 oz boxes on sale for $2.20-$2.40 a box. At least in my neck of the woods kinda makes the Amazon rate seem like not so great a deal."
5,Great Gritty Trio of Films,"This is the second film in the Pusher Trilogy. I have seen all three, and they all stand well on their own and together form a great body of work. The films are about the seedy underground world of drugs and crime in Denmark/Copenhagen. Well done, gritty, over the top, kind of a Danish ""Mean Streets"". All of the films are well worth seeing. I ordered this dvd quite inexpesively and used from an Amazon Merchant, came in great shape, on time and I'm a happy camper."
3,"NICOLAS WINDING REFN, OPUS 4","Extremely dark film about Copenhagen underground. The description of Tonny's destiny, the way he copes with all these people calling him a moron, his abortive attempts to go straight, are pathetic. No future. Recommended to all those who think that Nicolas Winding Refn didn't exist beforeValhalla RisingandDrive."
5,Nice quality,My 10 year old asked for these books for Christmas. They are very nice quality hard cover book. The paper is very thick and the edges are jagged to resemble an antique style book. My daughter loves the Lemony Snicket series.
1,what qualitfications does this student have?,"What qualifications does this author have to sell his works?The article states he was a grad of IU, but there is no mention of any practical legal experience in his background. Also his qualifications never mentions if he is able to practice in any state. Did they ever take/fail the bar exam?I rarely write critical reviews, but this article was far too wordy and an embarassment to other IU law graduates. He needs to say what he has to say and move on. No need to write pages and pages when a short and effective explanation would have done the job."
1,Cowboy,"You may not be a good writer, but at boarding school you were the best cowboy. Hope to see you soon partner!"
5,A great self help book!,"This book is a wonderful, hands-on guide to self-care. It is practical, easy to use and has a wealth of affirmative suggestions for taking better care of yourself. A must for anyone stressed out!"
5,Best Boulez!,"This is, to my ears, the best thing Boulez produced as a conductor. Significantly better than the commercial recording too. Who can fathom what alchemy allowed this conductor to produce this reading so different from his usual approach. But he made the most of an odd, great work, and it is one to be grateful for."
2,.,"Okay, I don't work in a board room so I might not be the best judge here...but I didn't enjoy this. I was looking for something with an original take on magic for practical use but what it was, was a 101 lesson for those who might be too wary to use magick in their professional lives or those who don't know what magick really is."
3,Meh,"I guess there's ok information in here? I mean, lots of common sense things, and writing wise it was hard for me to get into. I don't regret buying it to have on my shelf but I don't know if I would hesitate to loan it out and potentially not get it back."
3,Tastes alright,"I had really high expectations for this product but after tasting it I give it fair to good marks, not excellent. It was nice and thick so that was great, but it had a bit of an odor/taste which probably comes from the fructose syrup used to sweeten it (instead of sugar) or the caramel coloring. I don't think I would like to use this syrup alone to make my tea so what I do is I make my own Thai tea (with hot water,thai tea,cotton sift, sugar) then I add a bit of thai syrup to it to thicken it so it helps the milk sit on top. It great that way."
5,Linda Robinson's Choice,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD from the Gaither Vocal Band. I enjoy their music because they have a lighter, easy-listening sound compared to traditional southern gospel. They have no screaming tenor voices or really low basses. Gaither Vocal Band is more of a ""country hip"" southern gospel. Through each line-up change, the sound remains the same smooth harmony. On ""Everything Good,"", Russ Taff, one of my favorites joins the great voices of David Phelps and Guy Penrod. All the songs are great, but I especially enjoyed ""Heartbreak Ridge and New Hope Road"" which is very upbeat and ""When He Talked About His Home"" which was really ""sweet and melodious."" I try to purchase every Gaither Vocal Band CD that I can find."
4,Still very solid music,"The Gaither Vocal Band is a southern Gospel group. It has been a stepping stone for many current Contemporary Christian artists such as Steve Green, Larnelle Harris, Jonathan Pierce, and others. I have enjoyed most of what they have done. The GVB is responsible for the Homecoming series. I am glad to see that their southern roots are still there."
2,What a Let Down,"Bill Gaither is the most talented Christian music writer in our history. However, I wonder what he was thinking with this album. I agree that Russ Taff has way too many solos on this album. With this ""very country"" CD and the addition of Russ Taff, it is appearant that Mr. Gaither wants to appeal more to the older audience. The people who were with me at the David Phelps solo concert that loved ""I Do Believe"" will not like this album, along with myself. The good points: Alpha and Omega and I Pledge My Allegiance. I love David Phelps, but even It Is Finished is over the top with that little solo accapella part. There is a better version of It Is Finished on the Irish Homecoming. I understand that with new talent, you can rehash some old stuff and make it ""like new"" but if it is not broken, don't fix it."
5,Different - But Everything Good,"Like most, I expected the same formula that's proven the last two GVB albums successful. However, Everything Good is not that. While it's not a radical departure, the addition of Russ Taff is brought to the forefront of the project.I initially rejected the CD when I listened to the preview in the store, but after finally buying it, I must say that I'm very pleased. In fact, after listening a couple of times, I'm really into it. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves good music!"
2,What Happened?!!,"I must say, that unfortunately, I agree with those who voice their disappointment in this latest GVB project -- what happened? Well, Mark Lowry left, for one thing - and I have to say I wasn't thrilled with the addition of Russ Taff. I have to say that I think ""The Really Good News"" is one of the corniest songs I have ever heard, and should never have been included on this album. Like another reviewer, I was disappointed with the arrangement of ""It is Finished"" - just not what I was hoping for. The album features Russ Taff in solos way to much for my tastes, and sticks David Phelps up on the shelf. I am a loyal GVB fan, and I was really looking forward to this CD's release, but all I could think was, ""what a bunch of junk."" Except for ""Alpha and Omega"", this is not the GVB I have grown to love over the years - give me more like ""God is Good"" and ""I Do Believe"" !! If you are considering this as a first GVB purchase, STOP! and buy one of the others instead."
1,"""Everything Good"" not so good.","I found this album disappointing. Both the song selections and the vocals are lackluster. Mark Lowry left the band this year and David Phelps's magnificent tenor has been kept in the background on this new CD. Too bad. Their previous album ""I Do Believe"" is outstanding."
2,If only he had done it,"If only he had written a story that could be read with some continuity and insight. The opening sentence is great, and he follows through for 3 or 4 pages of a story that looks promising. But there it turns into jabberwocky as you try to figure what is going on and who is dead or alive. Finally, one gives up. If the writer does not communicate with the reader, what is the purpose of the writing? Perhaps if one could discover how the writer was managing to elude reality, he could partake of the same substance and enjoy this story. I don't care to take the chance."
2,Pedro Paramo,"Didn't really know what to expect, and this was a disappointment. He's a good writer, but the subject matter simply does not fascinate me."
4,Pedro Paramo (English Version),"The book is translated into English from its original Spanish version. It's a complex book with references to Greek mythology and takes a bit of careful observation to fully understand. I'd recommend it to people who have rich, previous knowledge of Greek mythology."
3,Hay que leerlo dos veces!,"Este es un libro que me lo recomendaron mucho, pero en realidad esperaba más. El manejo de la ""atemporalidad"" es interesante, y también lo que quiere plantear en la relación madre-hijo-padre. Es una descripción muy buena de la realidad latinoamericana. Es un libro que hay que leer dos veces para entenderlo mejor."
2,distinctively scattered,"This book, although the plot could be interesting, it jumps without any clues from present to past, life to death. I was too busy thinking about what part of the story I was in to really appreciate the story line. After I read several pages, I got to actually think about what was going on. The book can be enjoyed, because I think the story line could be interesting just too much detail is involved. I don't reccomend it."
4,Beautifully written prose from between dreams and awake,"A beautiful rendition of the world between the living and the dead. A book written in surrealist prose of a man's life told from many different points of view. And from many different points in time. A must read, to fully comprehend it, it becomes a multiply times must read. A perfect example of the mystical realism genre."
3,"Fellow ""IB-ers""","This is by far the most confusing book I've ever read. Within the first paragraphs of the novel Rulfo grasps the reader's attention and pulls them into an unknown magical world...Comala. The never ending themes of ghosts, death, whispering, and love draw in a reader's every bit of imagination. After a first reading I was completely lost and most definitely would not feel comfortable with writing a full blown review. Although I strongly feel I need to read this book again to understand it one of the things I love about Pedro Paramo is that the reader is so confused! You keep reading, hoping a key passage will illuminate what this book really means! It's essential to keep an open mind while reading, there are so many angles you can look at this novel from. It truly is a remarkable piece of work, so be patient! Who knows? Rulfo's odd sense of style could be something you relate to the most! Good luck reading!"
5,Marvelous Story,I first read this book in a university Spanish class. It is a classic that will endure forever and speaks to all people.
1,Confusing,"This book is the most boring and confusing book I've ever read. God, what the hell was Juan Rulfo thinking when he wrote this book? I mean The story is great, but it doesn't have flow. I mean I like it because it reminds me so of the other novels I've read a while ago. I'm thinking about reading it again. I might change my mind when I read it again. Then I might give it more start."
4,Excellent read!,"This book is an excellent read. I only wish it were more accessible and more affordable. I'm teaching it, but my students have to purchase. This is a hefty price for 17 year olds. GREAT BOOK!!!!"
4,"An excellent, dynamic, and interesting book",More than point A to point B this aesthetically rich and thought provoking novelis wonderfully dark. A fascinating work that forces the reader to actively engage an intriguing and beautiful work.
2,"Poor quality, annoying instructor",This was filmed in a very dark studio with people who don't know the routines. Very basic moves with little direction. The instructor seems to be getting cues from behind the camera and then remembers to change the routine. She seems a little surprised to find herself leading a workout video and will suddenly scream out. I only keep it around for abs when my workout doesn't include my core.
5,My favorite workout DVD,"This is the aerobics DVD I always go back to. It offers a several realistic workouts, ones that I can get through and feel as though I've worked hard. She doesn't coy her audience, but rather treats it with respect, as though they are a group that is used to working out. She manages to be encouraging at the same time! This is well worth the money. I hope BodyWisdommedia comes out with more DVDs like this one."
3,That voice--eek!,"I agree with the reviewers about that squeaky awful voice. I tried this video and could barely get a few minutes into it before it drove me up the wall. If you can get past the voice, then this looks like a nice workout with good variety, but I just couldn't take it. I almost gave this DVD one star but figured that was unfair based only on the voice. I like a calmer (but still encouraging) instructor like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen Barrett, or Jari Love."
4,Meghan Doesn't Miss A Beat,"Challenging workouts, multiple options and various time intervals , and you can't go wrong. The instruction is precise, steady, and careful, with strict attention to form and intensity."
4,Pretty Good,"Nice video. The instruction was pretty simple and could be a bit tighter, but I was more concerned with workout intensity and whether or not it got my heart racing. The video not only did that but offered several different optional workouts to chose from which targeted various bodyparts which in my case was hips and thighs and/or offered several different timed workouts thatwere great for days when I do not have a great deal of time to exercise and none the less want to think too much about devising a program shorter than my normal routine.The instructor looked great and offered up some helpful fitness and diet tips on the video. Id say I was pretty happy with the video and recommend for those looking for something different but produces results."
5,You Won't Be Disappointed,"This DVD offers up tons of workouts for about every every occasion. The workouts get the heart pumping quick and fast, which I love and may waist had begun to shrink in just a few short weeks. Id say I've already lost about 10 lbs. I originally saw this DVD in the Los Angeles Times, and picked it, up. Ive been very pleased and highly recommend."
4,Cool Buy,"I have several workout videos in my library collection and this one is probably one of the best. DVD has many different exercise rountines which made me sweat like crazy. Overall I liked the variety, and kickboxing rountine and suprising the ab exercises were plentiful and challenging, considering I do tons of ab exercises several times a week. Easily recommend."
3,Okay workout if you can listen to her voice!,"This workout had alot of potential, until hearing the instructor's whiny, high pitched voice. The moves were decent, I just could not get past her voice, plus she lacked personality and motivation. The workout itself was okay, I just couoldn't listen to the instructor!"
3,"Good workout, poor instruction","You will work up a good sweat and get a balanced workout, with many workout options, from this DVD. It's a good bargain for the price, but the instructor does not realize that her right is our left and often she is out of sync with the other two exercisers in the video. Also, the form of the guy in the back is, well, sloppy. If these things won't bother you, I recommend the video. If you are new to exercise, you might want to try a more reputed instructor, such as Kathy Smith"
5,From a girl who's tried them all!!,"Take my advice and get this tape! Meghan gets right down to business! Each excersise gets right to the spot and tones you! I love how easy it is to follow each move. I have so much fun doing this tape that I look forward to doing it again the next day. I'm seeing a difference after just 1 week!! Having this tape is like having a real personal trainer at your finger tips. I'm thrilled that me search is over! I found the perfect workout tape. Take it from me, you won't be sorry!!!!!!!!"
4,Great workout!!!,I have enjoyed all of the segments of this video. The bootcamp and kickboxing parts are a great cardio workout and really get your heart rate up. The weights segment is a quick (30 min) but effective workout. There is also an option to do a 25 minute abs segment as well. I'm pretty picky when it comes to workout videos but this one is great!
3,"a solid start, but not a must have.","This album is strictly for Satriani fans, completists, collectors, etc.It is not the best debut album by an artist. Hendrix, Santana, Malmsteen, Clapton, the Doors, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, the Beatles, etc. all had far superior debuts, that you could tell they were headed for stardom.Judging from this album, with half tracks firmly stuck in the 80's, I would not imagine Satriani some day being called the best guitarist of our time. I am glad Satriani went on to do bigger and better things than this."
4,Wow!! Who is this guy??,That was my reaction when I first heard this back when it came out. Joe does some very cool gutar work on this. As we all know he just gets better and better. Definitley check this one out.
4,"not of this earth, but definitely of the 80's","Wow! Does this have 80's stamped all over it! Satch's breakout album was inarguably the guitar classic Surfing With The Alien, but this was the master's first offering, and it definitely is feeling it's decade at some points. Don't get me wrong; some of his best stuff is in here. The title track is awesome, as are Rubina, Memories and Hordes of Locusts. But The Snake, The Enigmatic and Driving At Night; yikes! These three sound like they came off the soundtrack of a bad John Hughes movie. For anyone starting out getting into Satch''s music, don't start with this one. This one is for the collector of all things Satch. Still a good album, but not a career-definer."
3,"A good debut, and he's only gotten better ever since.","Nothing ""earth"" shattering here, just good solid material from Satriani's debut album. All of Satriani's succeeding albums are superior to this one, although it is still good in its own right. That says a lot. My personal favorites here include the title song, ""The Snake"", ""Memories"", and ""Hordes of Locusts"". Also ""The Headless Horseman"" sounds quite similar to ""Headless"" from the later CD ""Flying in a Blue Dream"". Coincidence? You decide."
5,This stuff is great!!!,"I found this book as I was searching for a gift for my girlfriend, Samantha, and all I have to say is WOW! I never thought that I would be one for love poetry, but I started glancing through this book when I first bought it, and I ended up reading the entire thing! My girlfriend love it to. Keep writing John, this stuff is great!"
3,John Forrestal's poetry is sincere and accessible,"In his introduction to his collection of love poems, SENSUAL THOUGHTS, nineteen-year-old John Forrestal admits that he has ""no real training in the writing of poetry"" nor much knowledge of it. He writes simply for enjoyment.Many of the 59 poems betray a youthful haste and lack of ""A Doubt?"" expresses sharp feeling in a spare, clean and concise form; ""Unknown"" has a clear, cwell-maintained sense of rhythm; ""Your Name Must Be Beauty"" has lovely correspondences (""slowly"", ""softly"") especially in the first stanza.On the whole, these expressions of sentiment for a real or ideal love are sincere and accessible. The book is deftly illustrated by Derek Lee"
2,This book is for kids,"Not to be too critical, but the poems in this book are very simple, unemotional and very predictable. This book is not for anyone over the age of 17. I read the entire book in less than 15 minutes, and was not impressed by any one poem. I believe any High School student can write a better poetry, than what's in this book."
5,They work!,It absolutely cracks me UP to read paragraphs about a simple product like this.... it's hilarious!They work! Perfect for hiking and camping!Done.
4,Indispensable for travel,The Travel John portable urinals are an indispensable item for any traveler who may need to urinate when a conventional toilet is not available. Highly recommended.
5,These are awesome!,"Used two of them on a road trip across the country. It's a lot easier to use them while the car is not in motion if you're a woman in the front passenger seat who doesn't want to flash other drivers and does want to keep her seat belt on, but using them while in motion is possible. These are a wonderful invention."
5,Great Product,"Before I found this,it was bottles and jars.When you are on the road far from any rest areas,this product is a life saver.No odors or liquids to spill,easy to keep in glove compartment until needed."
5,Put these in your glove compartment for emergencies and for kids.,"These are excellent. I keep one in every car glove compartment so that if a kid is telling me that they absolutely cannot wait to use the restroom they have this option. On long trips I have found that this is especially useful. I have a niece who would refuse to try to use the restrooms when we stopped. After being told that if she had to go later she would be using this product she was willing to use the restrooms. It does work and a 10 year old can manage it herself. I have found that it is easier to determine how bad they really have to ""go"", if they are willing to use the TravelJohn then they really need relief and I don't have to feel like a ogre for refusing to stop fifteen minutes after the last stop!"
5,can't do without it,"We just completed Kilimanjaro climb last week. This product saved us 9 women from climbing out of our sleeping bags and tents in the middle of the night and cold weather and unsteady ground. We all took diamox which made going to the bathroom at night a neccessity.It works really well, no leak, gel formed promptly.The only suggestion is the volume of 800 cc is somewhat limited so many of us used more than one a night. This product also works better for women and children as the opening is not designed for men. Highly recommended for any camping in condition that coming out of the tent is inconvenient.Very light weight and compact size.Very enthusiastic thumbs up."
5,Amazingly great!,"Bought these little guys to use while at dirt-track motorcycle races with my husband. These places are notorious for having wretched (if any) bathroom facilities. I'm a porta-potty hater, and would rather pee behind a tree than use one of those dreadful things. These little guys allowed me to keep from having a germaphobe meltdown! Easy to use in the back of our panel-van. Very discreet. They don't leak. They don't stink (well, not right away, I never held onto a used one for more than a few hours)... I can see how they'd come in really handy on long car trips, especially with children."
5,Alice,I bought these for my granddaughter to use with her 3 small children on trips. It saves time not having to stop and hunt for a bathroom for the little ones when they can't hold it. Of course they think it is fun to go in a bag. Especially the little boy since they like to go anywhere once they are trained. They love to show off. They are funny. This is an unusual product.I will probably buy more for my other great grand children.
5,best thing EVER!,"Ok, so if you ever told me I'd be writing a review about a disposable urinal, I would have laughed so hard, I would have peed my pants...and so...because of that, I'm writing this review. I am a middle aged woman with kids (and if you have delivered kids you know what they can do to your bladder!)and purchased these for a long car ride. My excuse was to use them for the kids between rest stops, but the truth was, they were for me...me and my weak bladder. Well, I didn't end up needing them on the ride, but I did find myself in a desperate situation on a beach without a rest area and decided to try one out behind a sand drift on a dune. AWESOME! The folks within eyesight would have never known what what happening under that towel as I stood gazing at the scenery...SO relieved that I could, well, relieve myself! No mess, no problem! It was so easy and clean to use. I will never be without at least one of these little gems! Definately worth it!"
5,Night time relief in my tent,"I hate getting out of a warm tent in the middle of the night for my nocturnal relief. I often need to go 2 or more times a night. I used the Travel John product and it was great! No leakage, no mess, easy to use. I have used a female urinal in the past but had the smell in the tent as well as had problems with it tipping over or not being able to hold enough (that was fun.) With Travel Johns I don't need to rig a way for the urinal to stand up or have a cover for it and I don't need to take it to the pit toilet or bushes to empty in the morning nor do it need to wash it. I just put the used Travel Johns in a plastic bag to join the rest of the pack-it-out trash. These things are small, about the size of 3 tubes of lipstick each, and take up very little room to pack out when used. What a relief!"
2,Poly mailers,"I don't like these envelopes as much as I liked the previous ones I purchased. They are not as ""solid"", too thin, seem a little flimsy. Hope they will hold up."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I should have known when I saw the low price that these bags would be total garbage. They are practically see-through. They are also not white, but greyish, and have some sort of lines going through them all, most likely from folding them in half to ship. The adhesive does not close, has to be taped shut, and two of them have to be used or they will split apart in mailing. Very disappointing. So when you have to use two bags to do the job of one, you are wasting money, not saving any. Spend the extra money and get higher quality bags if you run a business and need your merchandise to arrive intact."
2,TOO THIN,The bags are too thin when i have to ship something i have to use 2 bags because if i use only one it will come apart.will not order from them again!
2,Disappointing,"Pro: My order was processed and shipped right away.Con: I was expecting a white mailer to arrive... not necessarily bright white but white nonetheless. These actually have a gray cast to them. The look dingy and not something I am excited about placing my customer's merchandise in. This is not a deal breaker for me, however, the seal on the mailers is. Once you tear off the adhesive strip and close the mailer, you can easily open and close the flap on it. There is no security for the contents inside. This may be a positive for someone, depending on what they are using it for, but I won't purchase this product again."
3,Doesn't seal properly,The seal does not stay closed AT ALL. I have to tape over it. The bags themselves seem ok though.
1,Don't Buy. They are cheap quality! Tear easily!,Kind of Grocery bags poor quality. Not good enough to protect anything! Very thin and tear easily! Will not buy again!
1,Seal is Defective,"After the mailer has been sealed, the seal can easily be pulled open leaving items subject to theft, or accidental loss during shipment."
2,"Received 7.5 x 10"" bags","I ordered 9x12 bags via Fullfilled by Amazon - not sure who the seller was. I received 7.5 x 10"" bags, which is a bummer as I had ordered that size as well, so now I am well stocked and worried that if I re-order, I'll be just that much better stocked on the wrong bag size."
4,Is this Neil Young under a pseudonym?,"This is an LP, not an EP. It contains the tracks from 3 EPs released in 1996 and 1997. Imagine a vault of previously unknown Neil Young material, in his countryish vein, had been found and released and this is what you'll find here. Though these Dubliners can hardly be expected to have US/Canada-referenced lyrics. Two male singers: one tends to the falsetto Young style, the other is grittier. A perfect sound for sunny days. Jubilee Allstars will never break through to a mass following, but anybody with an ear for melody will be glad they found this LP."
3,very strong smell,"the freshener does its job in the way that it dominates odor. however, the smell does not smell like vanilla at all. it smells more like a very strong bubblegum flavor. if you want a vanilla smell go for something else."
3,Not very many good jokes,"On can read these jokes without getting angry, which is good. There were quite many Rodney Dangerfield jokes or similar jokes, which are not that great. Why is it supposed to be funny when somebody is mocking so harhsly himself? Perhaps they are funny when spoken among a great audience. There were too many which were rather negative descriptions about human beings, which was a bit disappointment. That is typical of most aphorisms, too. I admit that there were some jokes which require full understanding about American life, but I expected more real jokes and not so many one-liners."
2,Squeaky Clean Comedy a Bit Stale,"This collection of jokes does not feature sex or bad language, but includes many ""I heard these stale jokes before"" along with recycled Leno jokes, etc. There's a reason for the low price."
5,Squeaky Clean Comedy,"Being the wife of one the contributors I have been telling all my friends to buy it. They all have the same comment.."" It's hard to believe that a book with so many jokes can be so funny without(as the title itself indicates) even a hint of blue material.I have bought all of Judy Brown's jokebooks because they are, without question, the best with regards to format, material and contributors.If ever you don't know what to get as a gift for someone, ""Squeaky Clean Comedy"" is the perfect choice!"
5,All the recipes you were looking for and couldn't find,Just purchased this cookbook and all I could say was WOW. All the recipes I have been looking for done in a neat and simple format. My vegan daughter saw it and started immediately making a list of all the things she wanted me to make her.
5,Wow--Comfort Food at its Best,"This is probably the best vegetarian cookbook I've ever had. The recipes are simple, Jackson's tone is conversational, and every time I pick up the book, I see something new. I've tried about a half-dozen recipes in this book, and they've all been fantastic. So far: overnight cinnamon rolls, dump cobbler, country ham tofu, fried chicken tofu, and the requisite gravies. There are so many more recipes that I want to try. Do note, though, that not all of these are ""healthy""--many of them require good amounts of sesame oil and or margarine. But I don't care--what a great book. I've gotten it for family and friends, and my dad (yes, my dad!) even had second helpings of the country ham tofu. A keeper."
4,Great Cooking,"This is a great cookbook easy to fix not a lot of running around to get it prepared, tasty foods.A go to cookbook to fix meals in a hurry and for guest will like them ral simple."
2,Hillbilly cooking,"This book is cute and witty but not at all what I expected, or wanted, in recipes. Makes Southern people look/sound like fools with their titles. I will be returning."
4,u heard me buy it!!!!!,"i am a ps2 owner and i love this game.i have also played this game on the ps2 version and i still think the ps1 version is better. although the graphis are horrid the gameplay is sweet.i love the free ride mode.i also know a cheat that works for getting every level and all cars.it is circle,circle,triangle,square,square."
4,A Journey into More than One Place,"As the Call... documents the psychological journey of Dr. Alex Moreano, and on that level alone it is compelling. But what really makes the film of note cinematically is the abundance of finely observed details that create a palpable proximity for the viewer. We get an intimate sense of the Vietnamese as a people and Vietnam as a place that is beautifully wrought, from the lizard flitting in the operating room to the young women in white cycling across old Hue. It is also a veritable primer for anyone who wants to do charitable work in the third world--not only worth watching for its own sake, but an excellent educational film."
5,Thinking of you...,"Joe Satriani is excellent at transforming his thoughts into music. Songs like Banana Mango, Thinking of you, etc are so well written that guitar enthusiasts often forget he's playing a guitar and just drift away with the beautiful melodies. Joe is a person who focuses on songwriting. He stays simple where he needs to and complex in other parts. This album is so well done that I often forget how beautifully he expresses music without vocals.This cd is divided into two parts. One is of new stuff and the other is live. The new stuff is very soothing and the live cd is equally pleasant. The live band uses a keyboardist so you have a more ambient sounding Satriani. Circles and Crying are the highlights of the live cd. Tears in the rain is also so pleasant treat."
4,Creations on TV,"My 6 year old daughter saw the ETO commercial and could not stop repeating the word ""ETO""! A strange word to a parent, but it has definitely caught on with my daughter.We bought her the ""ETO"" a few weeks ago and she just loves it! I thought that it might be a little confusing for her, but she picked up on how to use the toy very quickly and really enjoys it!I think the ""ETO"" is a hit and I am glad that my daughter has a creative outlet."
1,ETO a real disappointment... Stick with an Etch a Sketch,"I was real excited since I grew up with an etch a sketch and wanted my 4 year old (Eto for ages 4 and Up) to get the new state of the art ETO ( Electronic Etch a Sketch).I took it out of the package and looked at the manual (not very detailed). I plugged it into the TV and figured I would try it first so I could teach my little one.Summary1. Interface is very hard to use. They needed a much easier menu system. If I'm an adult having a hard time using it, imagine a little one. I have never had a problem using any time of computer/video game system,etc until this unit (ETO)2. Joystick like control is very tough to move around for an adult let alone a child3. Graphics are not very clear on any TV set I tried it on. Text is quite blurry as wellConclusionStick with the old etch a sketch with the knobs and aluminum powder... It's tried and True and has worked since the 50's and hope that the next version of ETO is much easier to use......"
1,Miserable excuse for a child's toy...,"This toy was entirely too difficult for my 6 yr. old to figure out. She begged for it because the commercials looked fun but once ""Santa"" brought it, she hates it (and is mad at Santa for not knowing!). My husband and my teenagers all tried to figure it out and when they finally did, the graphics were terrible and it is not fun to play with. I guess it's a durable toy but that's all the good I can say about it. Save yourself the money... you're better off with a Magna Doodle!"
1,This game is the worst!!!,1. Can't see icons on the screen so you do not know what you are doing.2. Graphics are the worst!!3. Check out the instructions where it says it can damage a projection TV!!!!!4. Returned it after 5 minutes using it!
1,Review of Eto toy game,"I would not reccomend this toy. It is very difficult to see the images and the directions are confusing and it almost impossible even for an adult to operate this toy. The advertisments are misleading and inacurate. This ""toy"" is a waste of time and money."
1,What the???,"I totally agree with the other bad reviews on this thing. I bought this for my alomost 5 year old daughter on Christmas. She was so excited and we plugged it in right away. That was the only thing that I could figure out how to do. I am not a dummie when it comes to gadgets like this but for the life of me, I could not figure this thing out. I read the instructions over and over and just gave up. We took it back 2 days later. Extremely disappointed! Don't do it to yourself!"
2,Unimpressed,"I bought this toy for my 5 and 7 year old daughters. I plugged it in and found the graphics to be very pixel like. The pictures and the words were very hard to concentrate on. They seemed to move continuously. The price was good and the ease of use was great. My daughters caught on to the game very quickly, but I ended up returning it due to the fact that I was getting a headache watching it and so was my oldest. Great idea, just better the graphics please."
3,Am I Just Stupid?,"I can hardly figure this toy out, much less explain it to my 6 year old...hmm, always thought I was a fairly intelligent person. This is a fun toy, but hard to use with really BAD graphics. Maybe I need a couple more days of playing with the ETO, but right now both my daughter and I are frustrated with it."
2,Bare bones eating,I am vegan /vegetarian but cannot get into what this book wants you to eat. The book was of no help to me at all.The recipes are unexciting and many are very time consuming.You can eat good healthy food and not deprive yourself of all that tastes good.
5,Must have for motorcycle fans!!,"We love these videos. Got #2 & #3 for nephews at C-mas. Got this one for daughter last week. These guys are like the Jackass crew minus the grossness and add some actual skill and intelligence. What they do on bikes is simply amazing and thrilling to watch. This video also has some RV crossing, BMX, couch potato finals and some slip-n-bleed. This also includes Travis' X-games double back flip and his amazing rally car crash."
4,Disney To Go!,This book provides a wealth of information and could be overwhelming at first glance. It certainly doesn't sugarcoat your anticipated visit. The price on Amazon is also much better than retail bookstores.
4,Great maps,"Good book, makes sense. I liked the maps alot. It made my husband really happy to have a guide and he has been going to DisneyWorld since opening week. He liked the research that went into it."
5,A Must for any Newbie to Disney World,"If you've never been to Disney World (or if you haven't been for a long time), this book is a must. As a first-timer, I am so very grateful that I bought it. Reading it prepared me for my trip like nothing else I did prior to leaving. The other books on Disney World vacations are of varying usefulness, but this one should be required reading for all first-timers. (By the way, in terms of the other guide books, I like both Passporter and the EZ-Guide for their maps and fun attitude, but found Birnbaum's Official Guide to be both lacking in substance and filled with too much detail about some attractions, which could have potentially ruined my experience had I kept reading that dastardly book).Buy this book! It's the best choice I made for our family vacation (aside from picking Walt Disney World as our destination, of course)."
4,Good book,"We buy this book every year even though we have been to Walt Disney World several times. The book is full of useful info and is honest which is quite refreshing after reading some of the other overly ""nice"" guidebooks. This author pulls no punches which is helpful when deciding what to do."
5,Wonderful resource!!,I haven't been to Walt Disney World in over 10 years. A lot of things have changed. This is a wonderful resource for planning and information.
2,Lagging Behind When It Comes to Updates,"I found too many things that hadn't been updated in the 2007 version of this book to be able to recommend it. This book must go to press long before its competitors, because for the past few years those books contained information that this one did not (i.e. Everest ride at Animal Kingdon was missing from the 2006 edition of this book, but was detailed in the Passporter book).Yes, this is a detailed volume full of statistical analysis. Only the most obsessive-compulsive control freak needs this much info, believe me! That said, if you want to spend your vacation racing around theme parks so that you can brag that you saw the entire park before lunch, this is the book for you. If you want to have a good idea of what to expect before you get to Disney World, but don't want every moment of your stay to be planned down to the last second, then grab one of the other fine books on the subject.Either way, have FUN. That's the purpose of a vacation, isn't it?"
5,Highly recommended!!!,"I recently purchased this book and the official guide, while both are very informative, this book gives more details and tips, my friend used it for her first trip to Disney, and she and her husband called it the Disney ""Bible"", she followed it's advice pretty closely and they had a wonderful time! I have been sharing it with our other friends also, because we aren't going until December--we all love it!!!"
2,Confusing & not so nice,"While giving us some insight for our trip, because of the ""commando approach"" to touring Disney World, it took away from the ""Disney magic."" It made us feel if we didn't follow the plans exactly we would be sorry. It also did not give clear instructions for those of us who were ""park hoppers."" No good instructions on touring one park in the morning and another one later. Basically, we figured that out on our own and did not need to spend the money on this book. We found the Passporter guide to be much easier to read, more organized and not as Disney critical."
5,good resource,"Haven't been to Disney World yet, but I made all my reservations and got the seats I wanted at the restuarants and shows. I've never been and would not have known to do as much planning. I feel well-informed about the trip which will make it less stressful."
5,Truly a must -have!,"I bought this book along with the PassPorter, and this book blows the other away by far! The thickness of the book may seem overwhelming, but you only have to read the sections that pertain to you and your trip. The information was extremely helpful, and delivered in an amusing voice. This book was certainly written for any reader - neither over nor under the majority of readers' heads. Also the reviews of rides and dining were just right - not too in-depth but certainly very helpful.I highly recommend this book for anyone planning a trip to Disney!"
5,Having fun at Disney,I found this book to be helpful it has a lot of information so you can enjoy your vacation at disney
5,A must read if you are going to Disney!,I read and reread this book and when we got Disney I followed most of what the book recommended and our trip was awesome. We hardly had any waits for rides (my kids are 2 1/2 and 5) and throughly enjoyed our stay. When I go back in a few years I will get the most updated version again. This book was perfect!
5,Walt Disney World 2007 Guide,"This is the most fantastic book, I recommend this for everyone that is planning on a vacation to Disney World. This is your Disney Vacation Bible. This book tells you everything you need to know and where to go to find what you want to see or do. This is a must!"
1,Not what I expected...,"This book is poorly written and not worth the money. Too much time spent on vague ideals and notions of death and dying not enough substance. Dr. Bolen spends very little time sharing the actual patient's stories and too much time on the New Age doctrine she so voraciously clings to. A New Age sermon is what this book is, not a search for meaning during life-threatening illness."
3,Only so much to improve but...,"EA is the leader in sports related games. With Madden and their soccor games they have truly led the way in the team sports market of video games. Their soccer games have been great, but have remained basically the same for the last 3 years. This version actually attempts, but fails in adding that extra something. The shooting is absurd, the longer you hold the button the stronger the kick. This makes no sense...you can physically kick harder with a swift boot, not rev-up and slow down. As usual the goal-keeping in EA soccer games is terrible. You have little to no control a goalie...it is a real bummer.Nothing new here, just the same material released the previous 3-5 years."
2,Very unbalanced but worth viewing,"Almost comically unbalanced, but if you don't assume it tells the whole story of Casto, this documentary is worth viewing. If you don't use it as your only source when deciding your views of Castro and U.S. policies toward Cuba, you will enjoy it in the same way you might enjoy some of the Chinese propaganda films during Chairman Mao's reign. If this was the only source you consult on Castro, don't view it. It completely ignores all of the horrible things that are also a part of Castro and Che's lives."
5,Fidel: The Untold Story,"Very good film, everyone should be able to see both the bad side of Fidel which we read about in our history books and see in the media, and the good which I got to see for the first time in this film. Only then can we draw our own conclusions and stop being puppets who only believe what the media wants us to believe. Very insightful movie and very easy to understand."
4,Good product but the range is not as advertised,"I feel it is a better product compared to Motorola's T6500 (I have one). The sound is clear and loud enough for me, though some comment said the sound is a little low. The power can be configured by 3 levels: high, mid, and low. The channels can be set by either GMRS or FRM. The transmitting range (even at 5w high power) is less than 2 miles in a metro area, which you may want to consider. 26 miles transmitting range is a bit too boasting. You can easily find a math formula on the web to calculate the transmitting distance with 5w power and 4 inch antenna. Keep in mind, the power loss is proportional to the distance' square. If you really need 26 miles transmitting distance, walkie-talkie is a wrong solution, mobile or marine radio with 25 watts may suite your need."
4,W G,"I BOUGHT THESE TO TAKE WITH ME ON A CRUISE. THEY WORKED VERY GOOD. THERE WERE SOME ""DEAD SPOTS"" ON THE SHIP. WE HAD A GROUP OF 20 PEOPLE AND WE HAD 6 2-WAY RADIOS. IT WAS AN OVERALL GOOD PURCHASE. I DONT BELIEVE THEY WILL CONNECT 26 MILES AWAY BUT A MUST HAVE FOR CRUISING."
2,26 MILLES ??????,"I TRY THE FIRS DAY , FROM MY HOUSE TO THE CONER OF THE STREET IN HIGHT POSITION ... THEY WORK OK FOR 1/2 OF MILES !!! THEY ARE UNDER 100 $ .. YOU GET WAT YOU PAID FOR !!"
3,traveller,"Bought this 2 way radio for a family cruise vacation. Lots of static inside, worked well outside and in ports."
3,Disappointed,"Volume is too low. Reception distance good. Clarity of speech good. But, one has to be in a quiet environment to hear well. A noisy vehicle would be a challenge. Frank"
4,Great little radios,"I've been very pleased with these radios. They are very sturdy and seem to have been put together with an eye towards quality. They feel fairly hefty in your hands, not flimsy at all. The voice quality is good and the reception in town seems to be pretty good. I have picked up other's talking a couple of times today. It didn't last very long, though. Sometimes when scanning, it'll pick up silence and I don't know why.Over all, I've been very pleased and can't wait to go hiking again so I can test them out on the trails."
1,Don't Buy Quit working after one use,"Don't Buy These radio's, they Quit working after one use, and when I called and emailed Midland they said they could not repair or replace them without a Receipt, I explained to them I did not keep the receipt thinking the radio's would work more than one time. When I told them it is not operator error but a mechanical failure and I was a HAM operator, all they would offer was a exchange and charge me a $45 replacement fee. I will never buy another Midland product. I also purchase for a government agency and I will make sure that this experience influences my decisions in the future."
3,26 Miles? Not but they do work well for shorter distances,"I got the walkie Talkies very quickly and within the time I expected them. I only wish they really did work at the kind of distance they were advertised at. No matter, for shorter distances they are a good solid product and will not go to waste but if you are really looking for more distance you will be better off spending the money and getting a more expensive set. For the price, you can't beat them."
5,great travel book,"I own several of the mobil travel books and I have found them very useful. I have tried some of their restaurant recommendations and places to visit and I have been very happy with the results. Try, other Mobil travel guides too."
1,Beware!,"This is the worst recording quality I have ever heard from a commercially available CD. Abysmal--as if someone sat with a tape recorder in the audience! If you want ""La Gazza Ladra""--and it's fine Rossini--try another version. This one, recorded in 1965 during a performance, should be withdrawn for ethical reasons."
1,Useless book.,"This book is not only difficult to read and interpret, it is also totally useless for the 16.511 (Aircraft Engines and Gas Turbines) course. I have no idea why it is still the prescribed text since there are several better texts out there (Elements of Propulsion by Mattingly being one of them).Bottom line is: save your money and don't buy this book, even if it's recommended for this or any other course on this topic."
5,Extremely warm and sensitive,"Incredibly sensitive and warm story of a father and his son as they deal with separation. I really liked the way the main character, the little boy, expressed his feelings about the separation from his father. It is a good book to read to your children if you travel. Also, it gives parents a good opportunity to discuss ways to deal with separation, again with your children. In addition to the superb writing, the illustrations in the book are tremendous."
4,Beautiful and Dramatic,"This video is a bit over an hour long. It has some drama when presenting the different cities and the myths associted with them, but it is highly entertaining. They are able to show what we know as monuments in thier ancient ""glory"" through computer enhancement. It was fascinating to see that ancient Greece was not built in white (as the relics are today) but in vivid colors.Does not iclude Greek Islands (I was dissapointed that Ithaka, Krete, etc were left out). Does include Corinth."
4,Very informative and interesting,"I had seen this documentary on television a while back and found it very interesting. I'm glad to see this updated version of it, and was also glad to have it arrived on DVD."
1,You get what you pay for,"I love the rich color of these sheets. When I first washed and put these sheets on our bed we loved them. They were so soft. After three washings on cold on gentle cycle I started to notice that they were ""balling"" up. Instead of them feeling silky smooth when you run your hand across them they now feel kind of bumpy. I do not recomend these sheets."
2,Disappointed,"After initial washing, there were a few little holes in the fitted sheet. Also, the fitted sheet was too big for my full mattress."
3,Okay but doesn't fit extra deep pillowtop mattresses,"For the price, it's okay but beware if you have a really deep, over 15 inches of mattress/pillowtop, this will not fit properly! It started to ball up real fast and once you dry them, it will shrink."
2,poor quality,I bought this sheet set because of the thread count and the sateen feature and I assumed the quality would be as good as costcos similar sheets with the same features. The set I received was very thin and VERY wrinkled when washed. They are also too big for my mattress even though I have a pillowtop mattress. The exceptions to the large size are the pillowcases. They are EXTREMELY small and do not cover my standard size pillows. Overall I would not buy them again and it makes me shy away from online bedding purchases because if you can't go by thread count or brand name how can you decipher quality.
2,They Pill,"I haven't even had these sheets for 2 months. They are already pilling up, I would not expect a 300 thread count sheet to pill up as these have done."
2,Disappointed,"Disappointed... They fold and launder well, but do not have the thickness and ""feel"" I expected from 300 thread count sheets... :(I'll keep them for light summertime sheets, but I won't order them again! There are many better choices at the same price."
3,"Not bad, Not bad","These sheets are nice and comfy and are worth 20-30 dollars. They are not however worth 80 dollars. If you are expecting to get 85 dollar sheets for 25 bucks then you will be disappointed, but if you want to get 25 dollar sheets for 25 dollars you will be well pleased."
1,Terrible,"I wrote a review in January 2007. It was not posted. I never received thesheets I ordered. She would not even answer my emails. When she finally did, she sent the wrong size and wrong color sheets. I emailed her and shesaid she would send me a money order for the sheets I didn't get. I neverheard from her. I don't think we need these kinds of sellers on the internet."
1,Like sleeping on sandpaper,"Yes, they're soft. Yes, they're colorful. However, the fabric pilled so horribly within the first month of use that I had to throw them out. Even at $30, these were no bargain."
2,Falls Apart,"I love Sateen Sheets. I washed the sheets put them on my bed, and the fitted sheet started clumping up. Any type of friction against the fabric pulls at the threads. I would'nt recommend this item."
3,Not the worst,"I liked the way the sheets felt, even after washing. However, the fitted sheet did begin to pill after washing. So, while they were a bargain price, they weren't what I expected. The ok part is, at only $20.00 for the set, I can afford to buy another fitted sheet of better quality and still be on the plus side."
3,NOT THRILLED WITH THESE AND NOW I HATE THEM,"I LOVED THESE SHEETS WHEN I FIRST GOT THEM, HAD TO RUSH AND BUY ANOTHER SET FOR $10.00 MORE. AFTER MAYBE 2 MONTHS OF NORMAL WASHING AND WEAR THEY ARE LIKE 'NUBBY'. NOT A GOOD VALUE.GUESS IT'S CALLED PILLS, FEELS LIKE SLEEPING ON SANDPAPER. SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BETTER."
4,Soft sheets,Got a good value for these sheets. They've been washed many times and it remains just as soft.
1,"DISAPPOINTING!!! soft for 3-4 washings...then, piling","When I first washed and put these sheets on our beds we loved them. They were very soft. I purchased FIVE sets.After 3-4 washings we noticed that they were ""piling or balling"" up. UGH!!! The sheets no longer feel smooth when you run your hand across them. They quickly became rough and bumpy!I DO NOT recommend buying these sheets."
3,Not of high quality,"300ct sounds good, but this isn't. Beads easily, loses it's finish quickly even without dryer. Not that comfortable."
2,"Great at first, but pills easily!","At first these sheets were smooth, soft and wonderfully comfortable! But after about a week they pilled up (before I even washed them) and now they aren't very comfy at all. I asked for ivory but got dijon. They are deep enough to fit over my memory foam topped mattress. I don't recommend these sheets other than for short term use."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I bought these sheets in August of 2006, and after just a couple of washes and a few weeks on the bed, they pilled. They're soft and the color goes really well with our color scheme, but unfortunately, they were extremely short-lived. The 20 dollars spent on them should have gone into a better set of sheets."
1,I was ripped off,"I got these sheets one month before my wedding,, I started to use them soon after I got married, and saw that they started pilling after only three washes. They look beautiful when u first get them, and after three washes with cold water, and light drying, they look like something I would throw out. They are completely pilled, and they are no longer comfortable to sleep on. When I called amazon to tell them, they offered me 80% back, and I have to pay my own shipping,, I said forget it. I would not trust amazon on the thread counts of these sheets, or the quality. Be smart, dont buy it."
1,Never again,"I absolutely hate these sheets!!! I bought them in Queen and Twin sizes. They are way too big for the beds. As a result, they don't stay on. I am constantly having to fix them. I wake up and the bottom sheet is twisted at the bottom of the bed. I am by no means a ""wild"" sleeper. I have never had problems with my bottom sheets coming off within minutes of getting into bed. The material itself feels good, but it is starting to pill already. I have only had them for a few weeks and they look like I've had them for years.Never will I buy this brand again."
3,Pilling....,"We put these on no less than a week ago and they are already pilling. I only washed them once. The color is nice and they are soft, but they are pilling like a bad flannel. This is in the dijon color."
4,Beautiful Sheets!,"These sheets are beautiful and very vibrant. My roomate complimented me on the sheets and could not believe the price. They are soft, but they wrinkle. If you don't mind wrinkled, overly vibrant sheets, these are a great choice."
1,Regal 300TC Full Brick Sheet Set,The brick red color is beautiful and they shipped very quickly. I was overall satisfyed.
2,"Started out nice, but then....","These sheets felt WONDERFUL at first. Unfortunately, after several washings (over the course of about 2 months) they began to pull and get those annoying little balls of fabric. Those are not exactly soft and luxurious feeling. No matter what I do, I cannot get those darn things off. No amount of running them in the dryer, etc will de-fuzz them. Overall I am disappointed with them."
3,entertainment that is quickly run through,"I got this to span the gap in my kids ages. WHile officially set for 5-8, my 7yr old got thru the highest level of difficulty in one afternoon and my 3yr old son is now on it after a few weeks. WHile fun for them, it is hardly educational. This is just an elaborate puzzle that walks thru OZ, and in that it is very very good. Alas, however, I wanted something more. I think the DK does a lot of the absolute best sorftware and books for kids and we bought a bunch of it this xmass. Apparently my expectations for the medium are too high.Recommended as entertainment. I guess it is a good deal, given the outrageous prices we pay for movies these days. But I confess that I think we can do better. Much better."
5,One of my favorites of all their albums,"All the songs on FRAGILE are good, but then I have never heard Al Bano and Romina do a bad song. I am a huge fan of these two beautiful people. Knowing the story behind lovely Romina and her half-brother Tyrone Power Jr,I especially love ""Miracle"" which they sing together. The words are touching and beautiful. Young Tyrone could have had a career in music, I think. Such an interesting and talented family are the Powers.Al Bano's Nessun Dorma is outstanding. He has such an appealing voice and unique style... AND a very handsome man! I wish I could have seen them perform in person but will settle for just happily collecting their CD's!"
3,Good AOR-great singing,"This cd is not super but has that classic 80's AOR sound of bands like Nightranger, Bon Jovi, Survivor. The production is very well done and the singing really stands out. I recommend it."
2,I Like Sound Direction But Few Thrills,"Intruder is made up of some of the members from New Jersey band Shotgun Symphony and George Karak who co-wrote Runnaway, Bon Jovi's debut hit. The album as a whole is very enjoyable and great try for 1998 when producing 80's stadium rock style album itself was a feat. Heart On A Loose is an excellent rendition of Survivor's Jackie Don't Go. But that's it. Songs are predictable at best and have few thrills. They should have searched for not 80's copycats but the sound of their own. I would be more interested in Shotgun Symphony works and their second album ""Believe"" which should have more ""their"" sounds. Recommended for Escape music fans and some of Survivor and Two Fires fans."
5,Great engrossing read!,"I loved this book from beginning to end. Very well written, well developed like able ( and dis likable ) characters."
3,Editing? Spell Check?,"Am glad I got ""Island of Swans"" on the cheap for my Kindle, because I'm disappointed about the general formatting and editing of the text. I hope that the author will send in the troops and do a text edit to correct some glaring misspellings and mistakes (such as lack of proper hyphenation of words used as adjectives). I'm not loving the book, but not hating it, either. It's a good enough read, especially as an introduction to Jane Maxwell, Fourth Duchess of Gordon."
3,"Not Emotionally Easy, Interesting Historically","Other reviews have dealt with the obvious aspects of the book...an intelligent woman who is in the right places at the right times to have made an impact. What is a disaster is her personal/private life.At times, people have to make decisions between love, responsibility, honor, duty, reputation, and commitment. Jane's choices become emotional torture for everyone who touches her life. It is interesting how she justifies her choices and how they change the people around her."
2,The Duchess Deserves Better,"Historically interesting, but lackluster in literary qualities. The largely romantic life of the Duchess of Gordon, unhappily married to the Duke, a misogynist, and in love with Thomas Fraser, a Highland soldier. What the Duchess sees in this man, I'll never understand. He's certainly not her match on any level.What keeps one reading is that the book is peppered with historical figures who are fun to look up, and the reader keeps rooting for the Duchess to win her battle against the restrictions of her class and societal norms. Sadly, she doesn't, remaining chattel to the end of her days. Ware does not disappoint in creating a fiction based on fact of a woman who became a potent force in British politics and in private life. But she does so with little nuance in characterization, relying on the ""and then"" to propel readers along. Surely there was more to this woman than her love life and marital woes? I won't be reading any more books by Ciji Ware."
2,Not worth the time,"I did not finish this book, which is rare for me. The characters lacked depth, the dialogue was superficial and the book was one big soap opera in my opinion. I bought this book based on reviews that compared it favorably to the Outlander series, which I love. There is no comparison whatsoever. Ware is definitely no Diana Gabaldon."
3,Didn't love it but didn't hate it either,"I read this book immediately following reading ""Winter Sea"" & I think that might have tainted the reading of this book. I had a really hard time connecting with Jane Maxwell. The characters did have depth & it was interesting historical fiction but not really a page-turner for me. I often had to force myself to pick it back up again. All in all - this book was not terrible by any means but also not one of my favorites."
4,no title,"Long novel about the life of Jane Maxwell, Duchess of Gordon (Scottish), born in 1749; died in 1812. Book was fictional romance of her life and times - heavy on the romance! Sexual scenes were almost laughable in Ware's studied avoidance of any hard terms - just skirted porn. But story was good - 529 pages - if somewhat overwritten to keep it going. Very romantic."
2,"Just another ""bodice ripper!""","I was very disappointed in this book because I had difficulty with the leading character, Jane Maxwell. I feel that in her demands for independence for her sex, she is much too progressive in her thinking,which is out of character for the times.I developed little empathy or sympathy for this character, although I was able to like some of the male figures in this tale.Same ol' romance novel plot; just the names & plot have been slightly changed, but not enough to make this an original read.My advice to prospective buyer, don't buy for a historical book because it is not, but do buy if you are into ""the bodice ripper"", shallow type of love story."
4,One book that will definitely grab the reader.,"I read this book years ago and have always loved it. The book has enough historical detail to entertain anyone who loves history and romance. The characters are strong and mostly likable,their lives seem to be like everyone else's. The only thing I did not like was there was no closure. The reader is left with feeling that they have to find out what happened to Jane and Thomas.Ciji Ware certainly left this one open."
1,I wish I had bought TurboTax,"I have used TurboTax for the last 4 years, and have found it simple and intuitive. TaxCut is anything but. I came up short on my state taxes this year, and had to figure out if I owed a penalty manually, and tell this sorry excuse of a program yes or no, since it could not figure it out itself. I am very irritated, and I certainly will not be buying this product next year."
1,WORTHLESS,"Use another program. Updates to the software were very difficult to download. Submitting questions to H&R Block didn't work. You can (in theory) submit your return for a Professional Review, for [a fee]. Once submitted, the only way you can view the review is through a link from the program. THE LINK WILL NOT WORK. Their tech support doesn't have an answer why it does not work. I called their refund department. The agent told me that they have been so swamped with calls of a similar nature, that they cant even enter them into their system. Bad enough I need to fight the IRS for my refund, looks like I need to fight H&R Block for that refund as well,"
1,Not a Good Buy!,"This program was so hard to manuever through! It doesn't have the easy drop down to find topics as Turbotax. Each item, even though checked, has to be rechecked in order for it to electronically file. In order to fix an error, you had to go back and actually find the error yourself. Turbotax asked you if you want to fix the error and then takes you right there! It took me four tries to file one return!I'll never buy this again."
3,Disappointed,"Last year we used this program to do taxes and it was fine. It was a little quirky on some of the input and we really didn't use a lot of the features. Our greatest disappointment was with their rebates. We followed all the instructions completely, including mailing the original receipts, and we NEVER got any rebate money back. Soooo, if you are buying this with the intent of saving money in the long run on rebates, don't bother. They aren't very good at getting you the money they say they will."
1,Absolute [junk],"I bought the Mac OS X version.This software is hideous. Don't even condsider buying it. I took a chance since it was cheaper than TurboTax, and regret it. Incredibly buggy, irritating interface. Some obviously wrong calculations. I haven't even tried some of the other features that other reviewers complain about, but at this point I don't need to see much more to conclude that this is hands down the worst software I have ever bought."
1,Buy TurboTax instead,"This program had so many problems with it I don't even know where to begin. The bottom line is that the customer service department is really bad. Buy TurboTax instead, the savings is not worth the headaches."
1,Add me to the list...,"...of users who have used TaxCut for years, but found it to be a major problem this year.I did not have the typical problems of most people who have reviewed the product. It loaded fine, and never crashed.My problems were actual mistakes made by the software.I imported 1099 information automatically, from Fidelity. It turned short term items into long term, and vice versa. It gives you the option to delete some elements that you import, but then it doesn't actually delete them.I had 2 jobs during the year and accidentally over-contributed to a 401(k). It detected this, and fixed it. But I received a 1099-R from Fidelity, and reported that. So I ended up double-reporting the overage, and TaxCut didn't notice.I can also report agreeing with the comments about the user interface. I don't mind the tie-ins to H&R Block. But it's really very confusing and inconvenient to go back and find a topic, and enter into the Interview for it.Next year, I'll try TurboTax."
2,Jeez,"Program actually worked OK, but then refused to save what it had done, crashed, and made me start over.The state portion of this program is pretty lame. The whole idea of buying the state portion was to let someone else do my legwork. I guess they did tell me that I might qualify for a bunch of different credits. But they didn't have information on any of them. They didn't even provide a link to the state website where I could research them for myself -- and that was especially weak, since all it took in the case of this particular state was a quick trip to Yahoo! to find the right webpage. Also, their updater worked OK for the federal portion, but froze on the state portion.Next time I'll try a competitor's program."
1,Going back to Turbo Tax,"This is the first year I have used this software and I am completely unsatisfied with the entire program. Throughout the tax preparation the program would abruptly shutdown or perform an 'illegal operation'. Next to try to correct a mistake or update something on the return is not user friendly at all. I did update a few things such as the address to my daycare, but the program would not save the changes, so I was forced to print out the return and white out the section and write in the update. Also, when it came time to printing even more problems, the program would lock up my printer ad I was forced to shut down the system several times.I highly do not recommend this product. I have used Turbo Tax in the past, but I decided to go with this sketchy program. Yes it is cheaper than Turbo Tax, but never again I will fork out the doe and get a program that actually works and is user friendly. If I could give negative stars for the rating I would."
1,If you have Windows 2000 or XP don't bother with Taxcut,"This software is horrible. It will not, I repeat, will NOT work on Windows XP or 2000. It works at first ok, then once you upgrade it with their online updates, it will not work anymore. Also, don't even try to get tech support. They will tell that they know there are issues and give you some half @$$ answer on how to fix it, which is common sense stuff like reinstalling the software. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!!!!"
4,good but a little confusing,"I thought tax cut was really good. However, it was a little confusing especially the state version. (New Jersey) there were different sections that I had know clue as to what they wanted."
1,"Bad Software, buy TurboTax","I've used TurboTax for several years, but this year I bought TaxCut because of the free MS Money offer.This software is designed to drive you in the arms of an HR Block store. I had to manually go to the child care expenses worksheet, because it never asked during the interview. When you search help and click on 'child care credit', you get the help for 'child care expenses'. THESE ARE DIFFERENT!Anyway, there is a couple of more errors or potential pitfalls I ran into after using the software for only two hours, now I have to figure out which ones I might have missed."
2,Next Year I switch to TurboTax,"I've been using Taxcut for 4 years and with the exeption of an online-version fiasco a couple of years ago I've been pretty happy. This year the software was buggy, the UI was misaligned and difficult, and the printouts (supporting docs, not the Actual forms) were terrible. (On a Win2k system) Add to that the fact that with the deluxe version you still have to shell out another $(...) to get your state program and Efile (...) and then try and get $(...) back from 2 seperate rebates and it's just NOT WORTH IT. Avoid it."
2,Hard to edit and fix problems,"When using this product, I had added the same dependent twice (same ssn). I had a hard time removing the duplicate. Plus if you finish one section, the software will not allow you to go back using the back button. The software stores '&' as '_'. I have a benefit account plan where day care expense is removed before taxes. The system keeps stating that my employer provides the daycare, even though, I have told it differently. The system will not allow me to override this and use efile. This product needs to be better tested. The advantages to this product are the price and it has some good tax tips."
2,Buggy Program,"Yes, PC magazine rated this program better than Turbo-Tax. Some of the early reviews on Amazon rate it highly. People who used the later updated version mostly had lots of problems. Evidently the on-line update adds bugs to it. I used Tax Cut for 1999 and 2000 but won't use it again. I could accept the little bugs and the advertisements to go to H&R Block and buy more software but the last straw was when it wouldn't let me e-file. My operating system is Windows 98 SE."
2,Electronic Filing Sanfu,"Used Taxcut for the second year in a row and for most part have been happy with the product, I had been Turbotax regular since the late 80's.I ended owing money this year so waited til the last minute (4/14/2004) to file. That's when the fun began. Got a notice from the IRS today that the filing of the claim was accepted but that could not access my financial institute for payment. Called Taxcut and they threw there hands up, ""We sent them your claim and they (the IRS) accepted it, we're done."" Taxcut was able to process their $14.95 processing fee, the IRS could not. Contacted my credit card company, ""no problem on this end"".Have yet to get a hold of the IRS for there end of the story. My tact next year, file the old paper way at a cost of a stamp.In my opinion, Taxcut was gutless in trying help. Poor business practice."
1,Huge disappointment,"After using TurboTax for 2 years with minimal satisfaction, I read reviews on TaxCut and thought I'd try it based on the favorable reviews. What a disappointment - the interview process missed a lot of opportunities to automate input, it wouldn't convert last year's TurboTax files, and when I tried to e-file it failed. I could have gotten over that but the worst was upon failure the message claimed a failure reason to read below, but there wasn't one. After two tries, I ended up printing my return and sending it snail mail."
1,Tax Cut not user friendly,"I bought this software to use for e-filing Federal & state taxes. I recently moved to California and had to file for 2 states as part-time resident. I thoroughly read the specifications, and all information indicated I could do several states if I bought 2 state software packages. No problem, right? WRONG! Tax Cut state does not allow state e-filing for part-time residents, but it does not say so anywhere! I am writing to HR Block to get a refund, I am not satisfied. After trying to use the software, I ended up printing forms from the state's website and filing via paper forms."
5,A bad rap!,"Granted, these are not audiophile phones. Nor are they supposed to be. But they have surprisingly good sound, they are extraordinarily light and comfortable, and their build quality seems reasonable to me (so far, at least). And come on: how many products that cost between 8 and 15 dollars come with a lifetime warranty? True, if they arrived broken or defective, that would be cause for a bad review. But should you manage to secure a decent pair--which really isn't difficult--they are a fine option for those seeking inexpensive, fine-sounding phones. I think these poor fellas have received a bad rap. Their big brothers, the Koss Porta-Pros, are delightful, too, and compete favorably with headphones that cost three times as much. But that's a subject for another review."
2,"Ouch, what's L and what's R","Gotta find those comfy, clear-sounding, wireless bluetooth headphones. Had to return these after finding out how they felt. Sound is okay but my ears just couldn't handle the way the cold plastic felt against my skin. Who wants to deal with wires anymore with everything's going wireless (seamless-mobility) with Motorola's Q and compatible A2DP profile anyway?"
2,This safe is weak,This safe turned out to be weak -i.e. I was very disappointed and the door of the safe does not close fully (the combination lock is not sturdy it opens easily without the combination).
1,Tiny and Junky Combo Lock Safe,"I thought it would be fun for my son to have a SAFE bank to keep his sister away from his money. I regret not opening the LARGE amazon box the TINY safe arrived in. I was already past the return window. My 10 year old son and husband found that the dial does not work well. It's deceptively small on-line. When I saw the ORIENTAL TRADING COMPANY sticker on it, it made me even more ANGRY! Oriental Trading Co. sells JUNK. This safe is JUNK and NOT worth the $13 I over paid for it. Seriously, AMAZON has been very disappointing (on other things as well). This is why shopping in a REAL store is the ONLY way to go."
1,wrong item sent,"I ordered this safe for my 5 year old grandson, and the description said red, blue, or black, and much to my dismay, they sent a pink one. Luckily, my son discovered this error before he opened it. I am very disappointed with this shipment. Pink was not an option for this safe, and I would have never ordered it if it were."
4,Gift for nephew,Bought this gift for my nine year old nephew and added a little bag of change to put in it. He LOVED it and now feels like he has his own little hiding place that's all his own.
2,Note the small size of the safe!,"I should have looked at the dimensions before ordering this safe. It is only 5x5x4 inches, really only big enough to put a child's money in (my son wanted to put a few other ""valuables"" in there as well)."
4,Does the job for a little kid.,My son loves having his own little safe. My only complaint is that the knob can be hard to turn.
2,"Ok, not great","I bought this safe to hide something that I didn't want anyone bothering with. It does that enough for now. However, it is easy to open without the code if you just turn the dial back and forth a couple times. Or you can just pull it a little hard then it'll just pop out."
3,Ok for the money,"Product is OK. You don't need to use the combination, the lock is flat on one side and if you turn it in that general direction it opens. Of course, my son is young so he is fine with that."
4,This was an awesome product!,This was a very awesome product! Helps keep my children's money safe! Was very satified with how fast it shipped and how big it was when it arrived.
2,I had to return it.,I ordered two of these. One for my daughter and one for my son. When they arrived the combination lock did not turn smoothly and they both had trouble getting the safe to open. We replaced them with the toy safe made by Schylling and they seemed to work much better.
2,Not very secure at all,"The safe should not be used for anything other than a toy . It does not provide any security , it can simply be pulled open ."
1,DON'T BUY,"I was really excited to get my 8 year old a bank safe for her birthday. I checked all the reviews, and this seemed like the best bet. However, all the negative reviews turned out to be true. The metal of the safe itself seems sturdy, but the combination lock is a joke. It literally broke the first time I tried the combination, straight out of the box, and there's clearly no fixing it. I never even told my daughter I bought it for her, and now it sits in the shipping box until I can get rid of it. This was a huge disappointment and a big waste of time and money. Don't bother with it."
1,frontier safe,i ordered this in blue and got a purple one seriosly i read the other reviews and same thing happened to them if thats the case something has to change cause this went to a ten year old boy and was very angry and also cheaply made it turns and always comes open!!
3,Bank safe,When you buy this don't expect state of the art security this is for kids and it does a fine job. Sure the lock is very easy to open and is a little stiff when turning but it's only 9 dollars
2,not a safe safe,"It was not much of a safe since it opens by just turning the dial,should have spent more money on dial"
1,Disappointed,"Instead of a blue safe, I got a pink one. I went back and saw someone had put that in his review."
2,"It's a ""piggy bank"" more than a ""safe""","Notice the product description: you won't find any dimensions. The close-up photo is misleading; this ""safe"" could hold a tennis ball or something of similar size, but not much else. It seems sturdy, but don't count on having your child be able to store ""treasures"" in it."
1,full of inessentials,"sorry, i just bought these kinds of books. they have lots of talking and less explaining and teaching...besides, you're loosing all the essentials.find some other book for beginners or programmers alike. the title is lying, it doesnt reflect the content."
3,SO...SO...,"An outbreak of poison pen letters in the bucolic village of Tilling Green upsets the balance of village life. When dead bodies begin cropping up in the wake of these letters, Scotland Yard wakes up and smells the coffee, and suddenly Miss Silver, a retired governess turned private inquiry agent, is thrust into the mix.While assuming the guise of an elderly vacationer, Miss Silver quickly discerns that one of the deaths, which previously had been labeled a suicide, is nothing other than murder, as are the two deaths that follow. There is a seriously deranged killer among the living, and it is up to Miss Silver to determine just which one of the villagers is the killer.Fan of Miss Silver will get a modicum of enjoyment from the book, as will those who enjoy English village mysteries, though it is a bit plodding in the telling. It is simply not written with the author's usual deftness and finesse in terms of both storytelling and the artfulness of the writing."
4,"Actually bought for an adult, and she loves it","My wife wanted a coat hanger for her office, which is full of women, and they all think it is super cute. It's not tall, look at the dimensions, but it holds a jacket and bag just fine. Easy to assemble -- takes only a minute. Kids would like it, too. It's not educational, but an apparently durable, attractive, functional item."
3,Annoyance,I absolutly hate this controller. The only thing that i like is how much lighter it is. I actually learned about it last night. But I don't have a huge problem with it. The thing is getting used to the PS2 layout on the buttons again. And the only other problem is the bad back button location for extended Halo LAN games. I love the white and Black buttons new position. I think the biggest annoyance of this controller is the start and back button and the click noise the make. Well I think its a pretty average maybe a 3.5. At least it's good enough for me to grabn one. o_o
4,A great improvement,This is one huge step for microsoft and xbox the s controlller is the best controller ever in existence of course. Its a lot more confortable. The old ones weren't so confortable actually before these appeared i had 4 of the big ones now i dont even use any those big ones i leave for my friends to use. I only bought one doo to one problem it has a cord so im waiting for the wireless ones. Meanwhile this is the best controler of the xbox!
3,Use your PS or PS2 controller with Xbox!,"Although this controller is an improvement, most people still prefer the PlayStation style controller.Good News! You can buy adapters to connect PS or PS2 controllers to your Xbox.These are readily available online and you should be able to find them with a minimum amount of searching."
3,50/50,"when i got my xbox i got 2 controllers as well and yesterday when i got my first multiplayer xbox game one of the controllers broke down. i dont know if it was infected or if it broke because of all the times i got pissed off at losing mlb slugfest and threw the controller really hard on the ground but if your gonna get this: dont throw the controoler and dont mix up the wires like the [idiot] that iam and since i live in the middle of nowhere (la paz, bolivia) and even if you do live in any other city in the world buy a back up controller. and if its my xobx i guess all throw my xbox to the ground as well."
4,This is a great controller for the smaller kids,"If you have a video game for little ones to play on your X-Box, this one is a must. ..."
3,Not the controller shown,"The controller that was shipped was an off-brand controller. The package included a small game case and an extention cable which was pretty nice. However, the controller itself is lacking. The grip bringes your hands in closer together instead of the out postion (a more egronomic postion) like the Original Xbox and Xbox-S controller. The button configuration is the same as the larger Xbox controller, so no help there. The result is about a half-hour of playing you hands will begin to cramp up. Great for my 5 year old however. So the money was well spend even if the item was not what was expected."
2,Started out okay but went downhill fast,"My old controller was constantly having a problem with the wires and the game would tell me it had been disconnected so I decided it was time to purchase a new controller. The new one worked okay for the first month or two, despite a problem with the black button trying to stick quite a bit, however it started having the same problem and now if I move the controller the slightest bit, the games tell me the controller was disconnected and I need to reconnect it. This happens every few seconds and it makes game play extremely difficult. I don't know if it's possible to find an good controller anymore for the old Xbox or not but it sure would be great if I could find one!To add a note to the problem... the wire is all straight and not twisted and I have no idea why it keeps giving me the error. This is just yet another example where Microsoft products are nothing but trouble...."
4,controller for XBOX,The controller came quickly and it is in great condition and works wonderfully. I would order form this seller again.
5,Essential for Every Xbox,"In my opinion, there is absolutely no reason to buy the original version of the Xbox controller. The S Controller is easier to get a grip on, it conforms better to the contours of the hand, and it allows easier access to the buttons. For those of you who struggled with the terrible controllers for the Dreamcast and Saturn and were getting flashbacks when you first played the Xbox, your prayers have been answered."
3,For kids,"I personally don't like this controller cuz i have big hands, but almost everyone i know loves it. I am used to the big controller, so when i got the small controller i just let my friends or brother use it. This review applies to the Japanese version but I think the only real difference is the color."
4,X-Box controller improvements,XX--------------------ControllerS----------------------XXX-Box ControllerS is a big improvment towards the X-Box controllers. The regular one is of COURSE to BIG I mean God Huge Planet Huge! In other words this IS a controller that is huge. You cant really do anything about the regular controller because your fingers would have to S-T-R-E-T-C-H just to reach the L and R buttons.----------------------------------------------------------------If your looking for a small good controller what you can actually have fun with then this is your controller.The regular controller for the X-BOX suggestion is if you hands are to long.
2,I'd Rather Have Another Original Controller,"I bought an S controller at the same time I bought my system A: to have a second controller, and B: to see what type of controller I like better.As long as your hands are big enough for the original controller (which most of my friends and my hands are), the original controller is actually better than the new S controller. About the only good thing that thet S controller has is rearranged A, B, X and Y buttons, but the other repositioning is very, very bad. The Start and Back buttons, and the black and white buttons are right underneath your hands when you are gripping the controller, very awkward to have to bring your thumb back that far when you are trying to play a game."
1,Dissapointed Won't work with xbox 360,Bought these for xbox 360 thinking I would have a couple of cheap controllers for kids. This will not work for xbox 260 it will only work on older consoles. I bought two and by the time I paid the shipping. I would only get $10 back. Now I still have to buy two newer controllers. Spend the extra $10 and get newer controllers.
3,50/50,"when i got my xbox i got 2 controllers as well and yesterday when i got my first multiplayer xbox game one of the controllers broke down. i dont know if it was infected or if it broke because of all the times i got pissed off at losing mlb slugfest and threw the controller really hard on the ground but if your gonna get this: dont throw the controoler and dont mix up the wires like the dumbass that iam and since i live in the middle of nowhere (la paz, bolivia) and even if you do live in any other city in the world buy a back up controller. and if its my xobx i guess all throw my xbox to the ground as well."
1,Terrible,This controller is not good at all. The face of it looks good but if you feel teh back its like your holding two poles.
1,Bad,"I got this controller because I have small hands and this one was supposed to have a better button config. I have had it for four months and it is broken. It is totally useless, and the bigger controllers are impossible for me to use. All the reviews on all other controllers for the xbox are just as bad. Microsoft needs to get its act together. What fun is a game box if there are no controllers that work for it? Buy a PS2 and hope it doesn't break."
1,Too small,"I hate the smaller controlers for xbox. they are too small for my hands they must be made for small people aka ""Migits"" and u know they say about people with small hands (small gloves)"
1,"Wrong part, haven't yet okayed my return","I was looking for an XBox 360 S controller, this doesn't work with XBox 360 so is wrong part. I asked if I could return with no response. Poor rating due to wrong part + not sure if I can return"
3,the product was just what I needed but.......,the controller s was just what I needed but when it came it didn't workI needed to order a breakaway cable for 87 cents with shipping of 4.99I feel the breakaway cable should have been included with the controllerat the very least the seller/ Amazon should let people know they willneed the breakaway cable so they can order it in the same shipment asusual Amazon rocks in customer serviceCraig
1,Bad product,Sold me a bad product and it was missing a part of the controller bad making business with this person
1,dont work unless you keep messing with cord,"im very disapointed with this , the cord must be loose or have a bad connection , when your playing you keep getting a message says please plug in paddle. i could have bought a used not good condition paddle half the price but spent few extra dollars for good condition paddle , it is not !"
1,Xbox controllers,"First off don't let the picture fool you! These are not real Microsoft Xbox controllers. 2nd both are already broken, in fact 1 did not last even 2 minutes. As soon as my son pushed on the thumb sticks (sorry not sure what the correct term is) they dropped into the hole and he could not use them anymore because they are stuck down into the frame of the controller. The 2nd controller I bought lasted a little longer...about 4hours then the exact same thing happened to the thumb sticks on it. We have controllers for all their other game systems that work great. These controllers are cheaply made and definitely not worth the money. I wouldn't even pay 10 cents for them."
2,Cheap and Uncomfortable,"The buttons take a lot of pressure to push, the deadzone is very wrong, and the buttons are facing the wrong direction.It just sucks, but unfortunately there's not a lot of options for original xbox controllers today."
2,NOT high-quality,"Quality of product is far less than the advertised ""high-quality"". One controller came with lower right thumb cursor button broken. The second controller received 5 minutes of play before the upper left thumb cursor button came loose inside the controller flopping around, still works, but doesn't spring back to center as it should.There is NOT 9.8 feet of cable with inline release. It is 6 feet of cable with a inline noise suppressor.Not the quality we were expecting for the price. Looking into sending this product back."
1,ehh,"Didnt come with the exact piece I was looking for which was the connector piece for controller to the xbox, otherwise in good condition. I just happened to be looking for that specific piece. If you need the controller alone and nothin else that it comes with, its a good choice."
2,Buttons still too spread out,"I thought this controller would be the perfect solution for my small hands ... and strained wrists and thumbs from playing too much Dead or Alive 3. But the buttons on this controller are still way too spread out, and so I find myself awkwardly twisting my wrist for my thumb to reach them. The smaller size is nice, but they should have thought more about the button layout. And why are the white and black buttons on the bottom? Makes for a difficult transition when you're used to the larger controller (where they are on top)."
3,"awsome design, high price","the controller ""s"" for x box is probably the best thing x box has ever invented! their previoce model [smelled]!!!!!! way to large! i could hardly put my hands around it. thank god for ""s""! the bad part is the price. its 2x in price as much as the origanil, but i guess it pays off for better game playage. the new model has a new lay out for the start, select, white, and black buttons. and the size is a lot smaller! it used to curve out. they also added little feet as handles on the bottom. kinda like the ps2.so, the ""s"" rocks for the design but [smells] for price. u pick!"
4,nice,"I recently bought an X Box and this controller came with it enstead of the original x box controller so i cant really say if its better but i have had no problems with it, from what ive seen it is way much smaller then the original one and the button layout is way better, also i like the fact that the start and back buttons are on the left side of the controller becuase now you wont have to reach over to the middle to just pause the game, i bought another controller recently that has the start button on the middle and it is an extreme pain in the ... to reach over and just pause the game, It is extremly durable and comptorble. there are no known bugs that im aware of, of course i havnt read any either :P this controller is a must if you are playing a shooter game and dont have enough time to reach way over just to press a button. overall i give it a 4 out of 5 just becuase i havnt used the original controller and i have no clue if its better or not."
3,Analog gets too sensitive,"I had two of these controllers for 4 months now and one of them already doesn't work that good. It's not broken, but if you have Splinter Cell, make sure to get the original controllers. The analog sticks are so sensitive on these things. Another game not to get if you have the controller S is The Sims. On both games the camera angle moves for no reason, you just touch it and it moves. Another problem in Splinter Cell, one time I had to jump down from this pole in the 8th mission to get this colonel to use the retinal scanner and i jumped down and the analog was so sensitive, it moved by itself and I hit him. I can't get past that part so I am getting my shoes on right now to sell my 2 controllers and get a couple of the original controllers. Don't make the mistake of getting these controllers. Get the original Xbox controllers."
4,"pretty good, but it could be better",this controller is much better than the... big one. it's easier to reach the buttons and hold it. but the black and white buttons are switched which could be a problem for people who have been playing Xbox since it came out. and the start and select buttons are really really poorly located. they're on the bottom left instead of in the middle like a normal controller
3,Buttons are poorly placed,"I like th original xbox controller much better than the S type. I used the S controller and, although it fit my hand about as well as the original controller, found that at the angle your thumb is at te buttons form a square instead of a diamond, making it much more difficult to find and press the top right button. if you dont mind this, it is just as good of a controller as the original."
4,Nice second Option,"Many People say that Original Xbox controllers are too big. Well here's the solution the controller S is much more like the Playstation 2 controller, and I would recomend having 1 so Playstation owning friends have an easier time playing Xbox."
3,For small hands only,"After trying the new S-Controllers, i couldn't understand what the hype was. Sure, they're smaller, but high school and college students that usually play the system's T and M-rated games tend not to have problems. When my friends and i have halo parties, we always rush for the regular controllers and the last ones there gets stuck with the small ones. The button on the right control stick is too easy to push on the S, which can be disasterous when playing halo. Also ,why did they move the white and black to the bottom and the start to the left side? These are hard to press now. So, if your hands are small or you're used to PS2. get this, otherwise, stick with the original."
4,Definitely an improvement,"This is definitely an improvement for those of us with small hands (and maybe even those with not so small hands). The original controller was definitely a pain, but I made do until this controller came out. To me, this size and design allows me to better control a character in some games. This compact design also makes it easier for me to press buttons quicker if needs be (think QTE in Shenmue II) instead of reaching a mile away to reach a button. I don't even use my original controllers anymore, but it's nice to have them for back up or as an option for friends.The 4 star rating comes from these minor gripes with my controllers: The rumble on my controllers sounds like a mini-earthquake and rumbles twice as hard in my hands as the orignal did. This can sometimes be distracting, and it might just be my controllers. The analog sticks are sensitive and the buttons don't seem to be sensitive enough. Overall though, I think this is definitely an improvement."
1,no thanks,Why on earth are the start/back/little buttons placed so that trying to reach them gives you carpal tunnel? The Japanese sure have some incredible thumbs...
4,Well worth the money,"Picked one of these up last week and its great. I have normal sized hands, but my wifes are tiny. We booth love this one. The button placement is great except for the start and back button. It's not that you press them too often just kind of pain to pause game at times. My main problem is that if we are playing any game together I get stuck with the controller the X-Box came with."
3,Not comfortable after playing Galaga for a while...,"I didn't mind this controller at all in the beginning. But after playing Galaga for a while, the thumb gets quite tiring since we have to press the A button quickly for the entire game. I play the same game on GC, it's easier and I get higher scores. I wish there's even a smaller version of the Xbox controller that's designed with women and kids in mind. My conclusion -- do NOT play Galaga type games on Xbox, play it on GC or PS2 :)"
3,OK book but sometimes brutally violent..,I started off the book really enjoying it. I really like Carcaterra as an author and both Gangster and Sleepers are among my favorite stories. I enjoyed this book to a point but found myself cringing at the brutal discriptions of violence when his father was beating and sometimes raping his mother. I guess there was honestly a point where I ended up not wanting to live this life with him and subsequently not want to finish the book either. (Although I did finish it.) Carcaterra is a gifted writer insomuch as he uses his powers for good. I would have liked to see more of a connection to the Sleepers saga. I was disappointed that he never got around to connecting the dots between the two points in his life. C'est la vie! Good read if you arent looking for a extension of Sleepers and don't mind the brutal discriptive spousal abuse that occurs every other page.
5,Great thriller...,"The fact that this book is about his own life makes you feel the author and everything he has to say. This WAS his life, and all the details he writes makes you feel it even more just knowing that he didn't just write it, he lived it! The book is semi-reptative, but the descriptions are good. The book was hard to put down, but some parts got me thinking of my own family... Very good book, would reccomend!!! A+++++"
4,"MR.CARCATERRA,You are the best writer in the world!","I thought this book was absolutely brilliant,thrilling,tragic and well written.If you have read SLEEPERS you are sure to like this.The way he expresses himself is perfect although I still love SLEEPERS a wee bit more."
2,"Even if this *is* true, it's not nearly as good as Sleepers.","After Carcaterra's painfully prolongued stunt of trying to push his written-with-movie-rights-in-mind ""Sleepers"" as a ""true story"" for months, I can no longer believe anything that he says is ""true"". I think if I heard Carcaterra say ""New York is a city in USA"", I would check a map. That's why I was sceptical about this book, again. However, regardless of how fake - or real - the story is, its major flaw is that it's not as good to read as the fictional ""Sleepers"". ""Safe Place"" just isn't as involving and it lost my interest rather quickly. It's an average book and only recommended if you really cannot find anything else for that time when you're in bed with a cold."
5,A page turner!,"This was my first book by Lorenzo Carcaterra.He is a great writer and i could not turn the pages fast enough!This is a true account of him and his Italian/American upbringing in Hells Kitchen.A very violent and dysfunctional family,and that's putting it mildly...He seemed to have a ""love & hate"" relationship with his father,who was a low life criminal and a bully to just about anyone who dared defy him.A sad tale indeed but never the less gripping.I am looking forward to read his Novel ""Gangster"" next.Highly recommended!"
4,A suspensful thriller that will keep you up all night.,I thought this book was a very enlightining book for people who think that they live in a perfect world. It really gives you a sence of reality.I love it.
1,Difficult to read,"I love Lorenzo Carcaterra, however, the type in this book was just too small to read. I read just a couple of pages and realized that I couldn't read the entire book without squinting or getting headache. I'll never get another from this publisher. I'd love to read it but in normal size type."
4,"Bleak, Funny and Compassionate","A moderately humorous sociopolitical drama with charming and ingratiating characters speaking what sound like an ancient Cockney tongue. Reasonably suspenseful and a bit daring for its time---it provides a sort of ""Behind the scenes,"" account of British working class families in what appears to be the early 1960's. Alternately bleak, funny and compassionate."
4,British Slice of Life Movie,"Now that we glamorize factory jobs and wish we had a manufacturing sector again, this movie will come to a shock at how mind numbing factory work can be. A young British man played by Albert Finney works in a factory job that he may have for the rest of his life. In the evenings, he drinks carouses with his friends, flirts with young women and beds older married ones. Of course, as dangerous as life can be on the edge, his dual life catches up with him. This movie is done in the fashion of the British New Wave where the characters are understated and presented as ordinary human beings. A bit getting used to when every character in a movie seems more like a cartoon nowadays. Give this film some time and I think you'll enjoy it."
3,The Din Pedals have changed,"I am still amazed at how The Din Pedals have changed since the days I saw them in a small club in San Luis Obispo, CA. That's the area they got their start. I have an old EP on tape I bought after the show which was locally available and I don't think any of those songs have surfaced elsewhere.I do remember getting a copy of this album and noticing how they had changed their sound. At first, they were compared to Depeche Mode and New Order. I don't know if the lead singer still plays the drums, but THAT was impressive to see in concert.Anyways, great band, but miss some of the older stuff (going to go dig through my tapes)."
2,IMHO this cd bites!,"This is definitely not my type of music. I can listen to it without a problem, but there's a reason it doesn't sell well---no real ""hook"". Other groups rock, brood, whine, wail, or whimper. The Din Pedals try to do everything on each song and the result is a less than compelling album. BTW, I have heard some of their older stuff and it's a lot less contrived and more spirited."
4,Hilarious!,Tim Wilson is hysterical. Uncle B.S. is the funniest character ever invented. The songs are silly but the whole point is to laugh and you will.
2,Meh,"Well, these are not the bargain I'd hoped. In this price range, this is what you get:Okay, but nothing special sound;Fairly cheap plastic and construction, which means the fibers are less sturdy;and usually no button on the spool to rewind the cord, which means you're pulling on poor-quality plastic repeatedly.Still, if you want to leave your good headphones at home, I suppose these are okay. It's not like you'll miss them."
3,Kids write about Dads in their own words.,A cute collection of writings by children about their Dads and fathers in general. A nice gift for Father's Day!
5,Excellent mix for your late-night prowlings.,"The subtitle of this album, ""The Essential Late Night Mix"" is the perfect self-description. Whether you're actually listening to the album or just want it in the player to set the ambience, it really is a wonderful experience. If you get the chance, pick up volume II also. It's too bad this isn't available domestically."
2,Very shaky info !,I teach a seminar in Female ejaculation all over the world and this video only serves to confuse women even more about there bodies. First all of the not so attractive models are natural squirters this only represents 20% of all women. The curious people are women who have never ejaculated or have and don't know why. Debs book in great the video is lacking I would suggest Axel Brauns squirting 101 as a more practical guide combined with Debs Book.
4,"very eighties, but good info","this DVD is very informative, although a bit different from what some people might expect. It is NOT porn. The women in it are very comfortable with their sexuality and it is not men's whack off material at all. For women or couples looking to get good solid info about female ejaculation and the mysterious G spot, it is excellent."
3,This wasn't the 1999 I remember,"Don't get me wrong I really enjoy coming of age teen comedies, but this one misses more than it hits. It was a good attempt but I'll never watch it again."
4,"Not sure if I'd call it ""Medium""","I bought this knowing I might get something bigger or smaller than I expected, but I expect a ""Medium"" nail clipper to be adequate for a medium sized dog. This is something I will use on little dogs and cats. It is 5"" from top to bottom, and 2"" at its widest point in the closed position. I'm going to order the large, but since I use these for my pet care business, the two sizes won't go unused.The quality is ok, I'm going to remove the nail guard and I need to tighten the lock mechanism because as it is now, it slides to the locked position as I'm cutting which is a pain. There is a screw visible, so it should be an easy adjustment. The grip is a rubbery texture. I received the yellow and gray version of this clipper, instead of the gray and black version pictured, which is fine with me."
4,Great value,"I just started grooming my poodle at home by myself and realized I did not have any nail clippers so I was really just looking for something inexpensive that would get the job done, and I found it! The nail guard on the back is inaccurate as my husband relied on that to keep from cutting them too short and ended up making my dog bleed, but other than that, great product for the money."
4,alpha team ice blade,This is a great toy. I am 11 years old and got this a week ago. I gave it 4 stars for durability because my 9 year old sister drops all my lego toys on the floor and this one usually survives. It is a great toy and I got more than I expected. This is worth every penny. I like how it transforms and the new cockpit. I just wish it took more than 5 minutes to build.
4,"SHORT, SWEET, SPEAKS TO THE HEART","NICE MIXTURE OF WORSHIP, INSPIRATION WITH A SOFT, SOULFUL SOUND. VERY NICE...IT SHOULD BE LONGER - IT'S SO GOOD."
4,Holds it together,"I purchased this to do some light soldering. The unit is relatively solid, though not the most powerful.The soldering iron itself has a standard outlet plug. This plugs into the base unit to direct the amount of power.The stand is reasonably solid, the power switch has a nice solid click and light and the power control knob has a quality feel.In using it, it heats up quickly. I didn't have any problems with losing heat.I would recommend picking up a sponge pad for it, as it doesn't come with one."
1,Get something else - 2 of them died within 8 months,"I bought one of these on Amazon.com along with a fine tip for pcb work. The tip died on me within a month. The whole soldering station died within 5 months. Weller made me pay to ship it back to them for warranty service; I was shipped a new one. Now, 3 months after that, the second one is dead. I'm sure they'll want me to pay to send that back to them, too.Once in the first year, I can understand I got a lemon. Twice, shame on Weller - I'll buy a different brand.FYI I use the thing at most 2 hours a week as a hobbyist, so it is not getting put through the paces very hard..."
5,soldering station,This product was exactly what I wanted. Some products are smaller or larger than they look on the internet but this is exactly right. The tip that came with it is perfect for the jobs that I intend to use it on and I was happy with the cooling sponge provided. It was better than I could have hoped for and the price (even with shipping) was less than the same product sold in my local stores. The next time I need supplies or tips for this product I will look to Amazon before I go anywhere else.
4,nice for the price,a very inexpensive way to get variable heat control on a soldering iron. It's lightweight and compact. Heats up fast.
4,Good without much instruction,"I bought this in order to learn soldering and I like it so far. Used correctly it does an excellent job.The only problem I have with this is that the ""instructions"" are slightly lacking. I've never used a soldering station before so I don't know what I'm doing with the controls or the setup. So I'd like to know what each item does and how to use them.For example, it doesn't go to eleven ... ;) ... but it goes to five. The problem is: what is five? Who cares? About 3.25 works for me. The instructions don't say what setting is good for what. They just say start at 5 and back down from there."
3,Adequate for non-critical soldering work,"I have had one of these for years. While it is a decent little unit for simple kit building and the like, it's not the best choice for jobs where temperature control is important. Although it has a rheostat for adjusting temperature, it's not a true temperature-controlled soldering station and the tip temperature will run away if the hand piece is left unused in it's holder for too long, causing the tinning to oxidize. This means that you will be constantly re-tinning your tip, which gets frustrating after a while.I would consider this an entry-level unit; if you're just starting out and aren't sure if you're really serious about electronics work, it's not a bad choice. If you're already serious, then you'll want to look for something better. Alas, this means an proportionally higher price, but you do get what you pay for."
4,Pretty good soldering station,"I've had mine a little over 10 years. I suppose there are better options for around the same price, but mine has never failed me in all these years soldering everything from audio electronics to radio controlled vehicles."
4,works well,I bought this to replace a cheap radio shack soldering iron. I almost bought the step up from this but am glad i didn't spend the extra money think this will work just fine for any type of motherboard repairs i need to do. Only wish it came with more tips it only comes with one and is not meant for precision work.
3,"Gets the job done, not for continuous use.","I have had this iron for three (3) years at the time of writing this review. This soldering station is a regular iron plugged into a stand with a voltage regulator. The numbers do not correspond to actual temperatures, they are simply numbered from 1-5. The solder cleaner is a sponge which wears out incredibly fast, you are better off with a brass tip cleaner. The iron feels okay in the hand, the cord isn't the most supple or pliable. I would recommend the Hakko 888. It's about twice the cost but you get a quality, well-rounded tool."
5,Affordable solution,"This Weller station is a step up from a stand alone iron. The price is right and it has lasted several years so far without fail. I use mine for making speaker crossovers and small amplifiers, and it is perfect. The tips last longer than the bargain brands I had used in the past. If you are on a budget, this is the soldering station for you!"
1,I've had 2 die on me in 1 year,"Bought from Amazon, died in 3 months of light use. I am a hobbyist using this at most 2 hours per week, and not every week.Weller (Cooper Tools) makes you pay to ship it to them. They sent me out a replacement. It suddenly died 3 weeks out of warranty. Weller is going to honor the warranty, and send out a replacement, but again I have to pay to ship the faulty one to them.I wish I'd bought something else. When the 3rd one dies, I'll have to do that anyway and I'll be out the price of this one + two shipments across the country.And guess when it always seems to die - right in the middle of project when I really want it, and it takes 3 weeks total time to get the replacements from Weller."
5,Great entry-level iron,"I've had the WLC100 for 5 years and it's worked great for me. If you're soldering every day, you might want to pay a little bit more, but this is a great entry-level soldering iron for occasional use. I did have to buy a slightly smaller tip since the one that comes with it is a little large for some work. Normally I turn it up to 5 for a minute to heat it up and then back down to three once it's ready. I've used it for several large projects with hundreds of solder joints each and the iron worked wonderfully for all of them. I'll plan to hang on to it for a long time."
2,Not that great,"I've had this soldering iron for a good 6 months. It has been okay. But my issues were unpredictable heat, loose tips and a cord that is so stiff it makes soldering cumbersome. I have since replaced it with a Hakko 888 and wonder why I ever bought the Weller. $40 more but a world apart. The Hakko has a wonderfully flexible cord, tip attachment as it should be and precise fast temp control. A dream to use by comparison. The Hakko is very well constructed. The base unit is heavy and makes the Weller feel like a toy. Do yourself a big favor and pop for the Hakko.Sorry about the harsh review but I don't think the folks giving this iron 5 stars have ever used a good iron."
4,Turns out to be better than I expected,"Pleasantly surprised, I was used to pro models from my job, this little unit does great. Temp is best set on 4 otherwise tip oxidizes quickly. The only small complaint is they should have used more rubber than plastic in the power cords as they are not as flexible as I would like. excellent value though."
4,orange_Weller_soldering_station,"made in mexico, orange plastic shell. sponge is included (which looks like a cardboard when I received it and swelled up instantaneously after I put it in water). default solder tip is flat.At the beginning I tuned the power nob to 5 and the super high temperature burned my pc board and vaporized the solder wire! After a few trials, I found ~ 2.7 is good for my regular pc soldering. Till now no problem. Hope it lasts as a Weller brand."
5,Great product!!,Great soldering station.I have 20 years soldering experience and I have tried different brands over the years trying to save some money but Weller has always come out on top for me.The only thing I did was take out the tip it came with and put in a 1/32 tip.
2,okay,"This product is just okay, not very functional.I am returning this unit as i do not feel it was worth the money, it is just too light weight and does not have the power I need."
4,Weller WLC109 Welding Fun,"For the price, you can't go wrong with this soldering station. It heats to temp quickly. It adjusts temps well. If you need a quality tool to work on guitars like I did, this is perfect."
2,Little Spratling,"This pricy but slim volume (126 actual pages of text and photos), is written like a freshman essay. There are facts, but little that illuminates or gives insight into this unusual personality who founded the silver industry in Taxco. It is neither insightful or clever and a biography must have one of these characteristics. Much research seems to have been done, but with little result."
5,Best of the Oldies,"I would recommend this to those who love good musiclike this, and remember the days when we had this typeof music. Good seller and good product"
3,Maybe The Old Bobby Vee Singing?,On a tv commercial the old Bobby Vee in the picture sang without trying to give us how he really loved the girl in the song- that is is what the young Bobby Vee gave us. The young Bobby Vee was a lover. The old Bobby Vee was a singer without heart.
2,Disappointing,"We found this item disappointing. The directions weren't very good and we were missing a piece. It's fairly heavy (not easy to take up and down the stairs), the child restraints are either too tight or they slip off, and my son (who's 2 and in the 50%-ile in height) isn't big enough to pedal. So much for ergonomics..."
4,Save Money With Dataproducts,"I use the Dataproducts ""Compatible Cartridge for Canon BJC4000 (Black) (replaces BCI-21BK)"" with my Apple Color StyleWriter 2500. The print quality on black and white documents is very good for the price. To me, black is black, and I notice very few differences in print quality between this ink tank and Apple or Canon products. For the price, this deal cannot be beat."
1,Crappy service/misinforming,"When i ordered from them, I ordered 8 valves and they said that they had them all in stock. They shipped one, and then a week later shipped another.Then I was stuck for 6 more. After about 3 weeks, I contacted them and asked them why the other 6 haven't shipped yet. They didn't even bother to let me know they were out of inventory and seems like they weren't even going to bother to let me know. After I spoke to them, the guy said that they were back in stock and they would ship the remaining 6 of them. Three days later I get an email saying they are out of stock again. I contacted them and they said that they went out of stock that day I contacted them. I feel as if I was told that I would get my parts, that they would honor that and set the amount I needed aside since I've been waiting over a month for something that was originally in stock. Never ordering anything form them again. I waited a month and a half for something that should have came with the first shipment."
3,"Violent, but with some thought to it.","I would actually give this 3.5 stars out of 5. It's pretty good because they don't beat you over the head with violence all the time. But when the action happens, they don't hold back. An interesting part of character development is Sunwoo's realization that he has to learn to use guns in order to take down his enemies. For the first half of the movie he is all about fists until he is forced to pick up firearms when the number of his enemies greatly increases. The ""love"" story was the only negative point for me. He becomes infatuated with his boss' girlfriend, but she doesn't give him anything more then a glance and a smile during the whole movie. His love for her was his downfall but she never reciprocated. I would have liked to know more about Sunwoo's past. Maybe that would have given some insight as to why he was so taken by this girl."
3,Quite a funky debut!,"This is guitar god Steve Vai's debut album and it really shows a big change in attitude when you listen to his later albums. The mood is very light and pretty weird. A lot of this album features high, child-like voices put into funny, strange songs. This is quite a departure from the guitar masterpieces he created later on. Actually, there isn't much in the way of guitars, and the only song here that comes even slightly close to his usual level is ""The Attitude Song,"" which he also plays on the G3 album. I'm sure that when he made this album, he was already a world-class guitarist. Why he chose to make such a...buoyant album as his debut is anyone's guess. This is more of a novelty album than anything else and is strictly for Steve Vai die-hards. Believe me; I have everything he's done."
1,What was this?,"This is one of two Vai CDs I gave away. He can really play, but this one didn't work for me. Skip it."
1,A lovely coaster or frisby!,"Here's Steve as a young musician (not artist)working it out. He's weird, silly, Zappaish, and very bizarre. It's really a mess, Not interesting, corny, and NOT showing musch genius. I mean he puts everything but the kitchen sink in these demos. But they should have NEVER seen the light of the market place."
4,Worth a listen all you new fans!,"I recall getting this record after Passion & Warfare and initially being very disappointed in it. It comes off more like a Zappa record than a Vai record for sure, and I was not hip to Zappa at all at that time. It took me a while, but I grew into it, and now I like this one more than the later shredding records.From a compositional standpoint, this is one of the more inventive records in Steve's catalog, although P&W is very strong in that regard as well.This is, in fact, the record that sparked my interest in Zappa after being told that it is more like a Zappa record than anything else.It contains (mostly) everything you expect from a Vai record, the heavy stuff, the goofy stuff, a ballad or two, the heady stuff.. except there is much more restraint, much less shredding, and the composition is king here. An interesting look at the beginning of it all, and the ""leftovers"" make it all the more worthwile!"
5,Guitar God,"Fun with with whammy bars, wierd green aliens and lots of cool studio tricks. Making his guitar speak in ways we never imagined, big Steve Vai milks his whammy bar for all its worth and demonstrates that hes both the resident mad genius and sly prankster of the shred scene."
2,Sonar 6.0 Home Studio Review,"Can't import drum machines from keyboards. When choosing a drum map close to what I have, it won't go out my sound card. Only midi and Roland soft synths, forcing you to use their synths and hours of editing. When recording via midi, the songs play very slowly forcing you to reload the program. When recording midi, some tracks notes take on a mind of their own needing time consuming editing. TT-1 has some nice sounds and notation features but I wish it had where I can choose a series on notes and change the length and velocity of just one section in a track instead of the whole track. When altering notes in an existing drum map to match my keyboard, no sound came out. Sometimes when playing back a song, the volume and instruments will default to a certain setting causing you to record a new track and reload. This is a good starter kit and has many limitations but I guess that's with all non full versions of software."
1,Cakewalk for Vista has lots of bugs - BEWARE,"I bought this from Amazon and the audio was a real problem for us. We couldn't figure out how to get sound through the speakers. Also, the recording feature would not work at all, it kept dropping out. My son got another one; The old 2002 version (XP) which runs perfect on his Gateway computer that runs Vista. I would hesitate buying this version!"
4,The Review,"I have not had a chance to read the book yet, but I have scanned the table of contents, and find that it has the information that I am interested in learning about the profession of addictionThe Addiction Counselor's Desk Reference. I believe this book will prove to be worth the price I paid."
5,Zydeco Kingdom CD,"Shipped fast. If you love great classic Zydeco two-stepping down-home music, this is for you. Gotta have it and turn up the volume and dance, if you can."
1,Disagree with approach,"I disagree with this approach to learning vocabulary. The pictures have absolutely nothing to do with the language roots of each word. Yes, they serve as clever mnemonic crutches, but the end result is that the mind will forever carry around superfluous and inaccurate associations. I mean, really, asking you to think of someone ""prodding a gull"" to learn the meaning of ""prodigal""?I guess people are more interested in their SAT score than in learning for the long run. For short term gain, if skills with English mean nothing to you for the remainder of your life, these cards are novel."
5,sat flash card,Iwas please with my item and the price was just right. I checked around and amonzon price was considerible the cheepest. I was very please with the cutomer service. Thank you so much
2,could be much better,The mneumonic and picture don't really tie well to the words definitions. There are much better study helps than this
5,"Great Variety, LA Times Got it Right","I picked up this DVD after checking out a review in the Los Angeles Times. The Times had raved about how much variety was on the DVDs so I figured what the heck. Ive been trying to get back in shape for a while, and this DVD certaintly helped jump start my weight loss. Ive dropped about 10 pounds in 3 1/2 weeks and feel more energized than I have in years. Im able to workout before work and or use the DVD when traveling on business. Programs are great for beginners. Highly recommend!"
5,Sweat Builder,"The reason I bought this DVD was for the multitude of workouts that I heard were available, I figured I probably wouldnt have to go out and purchase another DVD anytime soon, and it seemed like a good value.The instructor has that bubbly fit personality, and the workouts are tough, I mean I was sweating all over the place, I thought it was a bit tough at first but then again I havent exercised in ages and over time my body has adjustment and I have switch to the the 60 minute workouts."
5,Helps Keep Me Fit at Home,"I loved the many variations contained on the DVD. The instructor Meghan takes you through some heart pounding workouts ranging from 15-60 minutes, which is perfect for when I cannot get a traditional full day workout. I defintely recommend the DVD."
2,I have 5 words for you,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Yes, yes, it's so special, the original fps. Although a good game it was dwarfed by games like doom and nothing compared to console fps. But what do you expect for gameboy anyway right? Wrong. Matter-of-factly, this game is outdated, and its not even updated! I don't want to be too harsh on the first fps, but if you want to play this, just have a friend with old games e-mail the shareware pc version to you, because its the same and the control is better on pc. Bam! Entertainment does make good games though, so get the other fps they made, Ecks vs. Sever; it is definitely the best fps for gameboy."
1,"It's true, Wolfenstein 3D is even out-dated on the GameBoy.","The worst FPS available for the GBA is Wolfenstein 3D. It's not the worst by much, Medal of Honor; Underground is pretty darn close. Wolfenstein 3D was the fifth FPS for the GBA but the first FPS ever to be released for any system. Bringing this title back from the dead probably wasn't such a good idea with games like Ecks Vs. Sever competeing with it. Doom and Duke Nukem were old games coming back to life on the GBA but those turned out so darn good. Those games featured beautiful graphics. Wolfenstein 3D's are just plain outdated and ugly, however not as ugly as Medal of Honor: Underground's. The game features the original 60 levels and 4 weapons. Only 4? Yes, I know, there were only 4 in the original but that is to little. This game is even outdated on the Game Boy. The game is still fun but there are a lot of better choices in the FPS genre for GBA. Trust me."
3,A decent port,"This version is almost exactly like the 10 yr old PC version except for one annoying fact: framerate...Framerate does not kill this game but it does take out some fun from it. It runs like the Super Nes version, which means slowdown with anything over 2 enemies on the screen.On the other hand, they fortunately decided to leave the blood and Swastikas intact, this is ironical because they changed Doom's blood to green blood, go figure....I'd say first go for Doom, green blood and all, because it's a greater technical achievement than this. And then, if you're feeling nostalgic for wolfenstein buy it.I certainly wouldn't recommend this for newtime gamers that haven't played the original PC version, as wolfenstein is outdated on almost every department even for a handheld."
1,BORING!!,"I liked this game when it first came out on the PC, but this version [***], the graphics are terrible making it hard to see what you are doing. I wish I never wasted my $$ on this one, I played it once and I'll never touch it again."
3,A Good Classic But...,This game is a wonderful classic to the computer game but...There is no music at all.
3,faithful but lacking port,"Over all the game runs really well on the GBA platform, but I definitely missed the fact that this port does not include the soundtrack from the original game. At times when there are no enemies present, the game gets eerily silent, and the music from the original Wolfenstein 3d was definitely one of its high points in its time. Other than the fact that the GBA was simply not meant to play first person shooters control wise, this is a fun game especially for fans of the original."
5,a great shooter on the gba,i got this game for 10 bucks and man is it a great game! its the same wolfenstein on the pc just ported onto the GBA. and its cheaper. its fun and addictive. It does suffer from frame rate issues but that is the only flaw in the game. if you like WW2 games or shooters you should buy this.
3,SEIG HELL!,"The 1st(and one of the best)first-person shooters on GBA It is good, but not terrific. For those of you who think that graphics make the game, you will be very disapponted in Wolfenstein 3d. Flat bitmap characters and dated sound effects give this game a"
5,A Must Have Game!!!,"Before you buy games for GBA, just remember that it's a travel system meant to keep you entertained on the road, don't expect a PS2 quality game on this sysem. Now to get to Wolfenstein 3D. Adding to what I said above, Wolfenstein is a wonderful game that any gamer would love to play. It's not a run around game where all you do is shoot people, you are trapped in a puzzle type of maze place, and you must escape by finding the way out. The graphics are about as good as they get on the GBA, and the sound is just ok, but that really doesn't matter. This is not a boring game, and I am highly reccomending it for anyone who owns a GBA."
